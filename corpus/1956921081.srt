1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,200
So, once I sign this,
people will buy my DVD, right?

2
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:11,566
Of course. For eternity.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,599
Wow.

4
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:15,799
Thank you.

5
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,433
You see?

6
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:21,333
You see what I do
to sell my DVD?

7
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,367
( music playing )

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,599
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Adam Ferrara!

9
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,467
( cheering )

10
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:46,632
Oh, thank you.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,766
Thank you.

12
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,799
Oh, thank you so much.

13
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,566
How nice was that?

14
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,632
It's-- God, it's so nice
to be back home.

15
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,300
I was all over the place.

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,066
I was in Jamaica.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,266
Yeah, I flew Air Jamaica.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,033
That's like a Bob Marley
tour bus in the sky.

19
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:17,333
The captain gets on
Air Jamaica like,

20
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:20,866
( Jamaican accent )
"This is your captain speaking.

21
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:23,066
( giggles )

22
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:31,066
Don't look at me, man.
Don't look at me.

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,833
I can't do it now.
I'll call you back."

24
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,400
( clicks )

25
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,133
Everybody's stoned in Jamaica.

26
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,266
Everybody.
The customs agent.

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,166
I'm like, "You need
to stamp my passport?"

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,699
( Jamaican accent )
"No.

29
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,699
I'll just draw a bird.

30
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:54,833
( snickers )
Silly white boy.

31
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,433
Look, it flies."

32
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,433
It's the strongest coffee

33
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,899
I've ever had
in my life down there.

34
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,599
That Jamaican
Blue Mountain Coffee.

35
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:07,532
I had to drink that
on the toilet.

36
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,467
'Cause there's just no time.

37
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,300
That stuff hits my little
Caucasian digestive system,

38
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,666
and the little man that controls
the valve is in a hazmat suit.

39
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:26,733
He's like, "Dump it.
Dump it all. Just dump it.

40
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,632
This is not a drill.

41
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,100
( imitates alarm sounding )

42
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,833
Emergency blow.

43
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:36,166
Watch your shoes!"

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,999
And they know,
the Jamaicans know.

45
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:42,632
( Jamaican accent )
"Look, the white people
had the coffee.

46
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,566
Look at the way
they're running. Look it."

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,333
"It's not funny, man!"

48
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,467
I was all over the place.
I was in Venice.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,433
Venice is beautiful, man.

50
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,566
Has anybody been to Venice?

51
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,833
- ( applause )
- Gorgeous, isn't it? Oh!

52
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,799
That's like old-world romance.

53
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,566
Guys, if you can't get laid
in Venice,

54
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,966
turn your balls in
at the nearest drop box.

55
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,133
You grab a girl,
you get in the gondolas,

56
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,933
they got the Italian guy
singing to you.

57
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:13,133
These are real Italian guys,

58
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,866
not like the guys
in my neighborhood, like,

59
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:19,133
( New York accent )
"Hey! Get the broad!
Get in the boat! Come here!

60
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:23,632
Don't be a pussy.
This is beautiful shit
we got over here!"

61
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,632
These are the real
Italian guys.

62
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,799
( singing in Italian )

63
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,133
Amore!

64
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,266
( Italian accent )
Go ahead! I no look.

65
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,599
I went to Rome.

66
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:00,733
Saw the Vatican.

67
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,133
You ever see the Vatican?

68
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,133
- ( cheering )
- Yeah.

69
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,166
It's tacky.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
It's overdone.

71
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,766
It's like Graceland
with Jesus.

72
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,733
It's too much.

73
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,166
Thank you for laughing.
My mother hates that joke.

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,933
I did that on TV
about three months ago.

75
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,933
She's still not talking to me.

76
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,866
She hands the phone to
my father when I call up now.

77
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,933
( imitates phone ring )
"Hello?"

78
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,166
"Hi, Ma.
Did you see Letterman?"

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,532
"Joe, it's him.

80
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,833
Mm-mm."

81
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,766
My mother's
a hardcore Catholic.

82
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,933
She has an oscillating
Jesus fan in the living room.

83
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,632
"I'm dead. Your fault."

84
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,266
That's the symbol
in the Catholic religion--

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,599
Jesus hanging on a cross
and he died for your sins.

86
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:14,899
They told me that
when I was a little boy.

87
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:17,666
"Jesus died for you, Adam."

88
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,966
Oh!

89
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:24,266
What have I done?

90
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,666
I couldn't go to church.
I was terrified.

91
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,966
And I always pictured
Jesus doing this.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,066
"You happy now?"

93
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:41,333
At least Buddha was a fat guy
flipping a pizza like,
"Who's hungry?

94
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,433
Rub my belly for luck,
there's no judgments here.

95
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,799
Lucky numbers--
2, 5, 11, 40."

96
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,899
See, I'm of the belief
that there's one god

97
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,500
but there's many
different religions,

98
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,799
so it's just a question
of which long distance
company you pick.

99
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,467
The Pope came to New York.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,133
Did you see him?

101
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,666
He's cute, isn't he?

102
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,266
Little German Pope?

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,200
He's cute, but he's got that
look in his eye, you know?

104
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,866
I can't explain it,
it's just kind of like...

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,933
You don't know
what he's thinking, like,

106
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:25,632
( German accent )
"Took Poland in 27 days!"

107
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,433
He's gonna snap
any minute, man.

108
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:35,766
Especially when it comes to
reform or something.

109
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,666
( German accent )
"There will be no changes.

110
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:44,566
There will be
no women priests!

111
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,833
Boys will not kiss boys!

112
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,866
Und
 nobody

113
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,266
wears a condom.

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,333
Jesus loves you.

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,166
In the name of the Father, 
und
 the Son,

116
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,899
und
 the Holy Spirit.
Hitler!

117
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,699
Nobody saw that!

118
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,632
Hogan, get the car."

119
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,933
God's gonna get us all killed.

120
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,133
Terrorists convince thousands
of people to kill themselves

121
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,433
in the name of God.

122
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:33,166
I can't convince two
of my friends to help me move.

123
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:39,599
And I think human arrogance
will the demise
of human civilization.

124
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,733
Look, if you think God
is talking to you,

125
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,599
and you understand God,

126
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:46,233
and God needs you to kill
somebody else for him,

127
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,733
if that's what you truly feel,

128
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,933
just sit down
till that feeling goes away.

129
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:54,467
'Cause I'm fairly certain
if God wants somebody dead,

130
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,000
that guy is dead, okay?

131
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,100
He don't need you.

132
00:07:58,133 --> 00:07:59,766
He's got the key
to the lightning cabinet.

133
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:02,532
So just settle down,

134
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,966
you arrogant, finite,
carbon-based life form.

135
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,433
Really hardcore religious
people that can't accept

136
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,632
someone else's non-violent
code of conduct

137
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,100
are dangerous to society,

138
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,833
and they smell fucking awful.

139
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:17,599
I don't-- I don't know what
the correlation is.

140
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,266
The closer people think
they get to God,

141
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,300
the further away from soap
and water they have to be.

142
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,599
It doesn't matter
what religion it is.

143
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,833
I sat next to a Hasidic Jew
on a plane.

144
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,966
I tried to roll down
the window at 30,000 feet.

145
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:43,333
"Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:48,866
Can't you pray and bathe
at the same time?"

147
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,433
I met a maharishi from India.

148
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,766
He smelled like curried...

149
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,300
shit.

150
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:06,100
It was so bad, my nose spoke.

151
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,799
My nose actually said,
"What is that?

152
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,266
Tell the eyes
to find a way out

153
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,233
and get the feet moving.

154
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,100
Namas-go."

155
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,066
I met a hippie chick
from Berkeley.

156
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,133
She stunk!

157
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,467
I still slept with her,
but she stunk.

158
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,266
Nah, I was with a girl
for five years

159
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,799
and we didn't make it.

160
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,100
We never married.
Marriage was a woman's idea.

161
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,599
I figured that out.

162
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,566
Yeah, there was no cavemen
somewhere like,

163
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,966
"Me only have sex with you.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
No work out,
take half my stuff."

165
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,300
( no audible dialogue )

166
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,599
Thank you, and why
my impression of a caveman

167
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:13,133
just sounded like an
American Indian, I don't know.

168
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,367
It did, didn't it?

169
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
"White man lie to us.
We open casino."

170
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,233
And there's tremendous
social pressure to be married.

171
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,400
Society wants you
to be married.

172
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,467
Married people
want you to be married.

173
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,532
It's like
a pyramid scheme, really.

174
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,333
It's an emotional
pyramid scheme.

175
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,766
I guess they figure, "Look,
I'm not happy with my life.

176
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,467
If I can get
two other people..."

177
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,766
I learned a lot,
though, I did.

178
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,666
Gentlemen, I learned
if you live with a woman,

179
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,100
and there's only one bathroom
in your home,

180
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,699
give it to her...

181
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,433
go shit in the yard.
Trust me.

182
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,566
It's humiliating, but
you'll save a lot of conflict.

183
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:07,133
They need room
for all their supplies.

184
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,699
You should've seen
all the stuff in the shower.

185
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,899
Puffs, and scrubs,
and lotions.

186
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,200
The upkeep on a 1975
Jewish girl is amazing.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,433
I didn't know
what half the stuff was.

188
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,566
You know, for two days
I washed my hair

189
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,766
with apricot facial scrub.

190
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,333
It was all greasy
and matted down.

191
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,133
I looked liked a Pakistani
nightclub owner.

192
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,766
( Pakistani accent )
"Welcome to Club Karachi.

193
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,133
Come, come.

194
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,433
Ladies night.
Girls, veils, half-masked.

195
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,233
Come, come, my friend."

196
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,000
Believe me, I know
it's not easy living with me.

197
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,532
I'm a comic.

198
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:58,599
I'm an insecure egomaniac.

199
00:11:58,632 --> 00:11:59,599
You know how big my ego is?

200
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,599
I keep a journal
and I'm lying in it.

201
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,599
Is that alarming
to anybody else?

202
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:09,100
I read it the other day,
I'm like,

203
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,566
"I didn't invent
the cotton gin. What?"

204
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,300
I have no patience,
I'm very immature,

205
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,233
I have a temper, I yell.

206
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:25,999
But I'm a good guy.

207
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,133
I am.

208
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,599
Look, I know we just met,
but I'm a lovely little man.
I really am.

209
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:34,599
I will instinctually make
the virtuous choice
to benefit humanity.

210
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:37,100
I'm very proud of that.
I believe in humanity.

211
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,933
People suck.
People just suck.

212
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,400
I'll let you into traffic.

213
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:43,100
If I don't get
that little wave,

214
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:46,066
now I have to
run you off the road!

215
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,200
What am I, the Bandit running
blocker for you, Snowman?

216
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,733
And I get so angry.

217
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,433
You know how angry I get?
I gave myself Tourette's.

218
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,433
Do you ever
give yourself Tourette's?

219
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,733
Did you ever twitch
and blurt out obscenities

220
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:12,400
for no apparent reason?

221
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,066
I'm usually all alone,
driving in a car,

222
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,367
it's a nice day,
but out of nowhere, just,

223
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,799
"Fuck!"

224
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,433
That can't be healthy, can it?

225
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,300
Just random spikes of fury
coming out of you?

226
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,333
I get it from my father.

227
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,300
My father's either
pissed off or asleep.

228
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:43,766
I asked him, I said,
"Pop, how come you're so angry?"

229
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,866
"Helps to hold down the rage."

230
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,599
My father's
got exquisite anger.

231
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,566
Just mwah!

232
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,799
It's total communication.

233
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,033
You're never gonna
look at my father and think,

234
00:13:58,066 --> 00:13:59,799
"Mm, I wonder
what's on his mind."

235
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,166
I got arrested
when I was 16 years old.

236
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,966
Kid stuff.
Stole a car. So...

237
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,632
The local cops find me.
They say, "Come on, kid.
We're gonna take you home."

238
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,999
"No, no, no, no, no.

239
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,400
Lock me up,
give me the chair,

240
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:18,599
but don't wake my father up."

241
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:20,433
They take me to the station,
they call my father.

242
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,433
"Mr. Ferrara,
we have your son here
at the fourth precinct."

243
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,233
"Yeah? Keep him."

244
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,200
He made me spend
the night in jail.

245
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,100
In the morning,
I heard the truck pull up,
I looked out of the cell.

246
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,300
Out of the corner of the cell,
I see him, he's signing the--

247
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,966
he doesn't say a word,
he's just sitting.

248
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,300
He looks into the cell
and just goes...

249
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,266
A 20-year police captain
opened up the bars like this,

250
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,467
( laughing )
"Oh, fuck!"

251
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,766
I get my communication skills
from my father, too,

252
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,966
which is nothing.

253
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,699
Absolutely nothing.

254
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,733
He's 66 years old.

255
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,033
He's down to grunts
at this point in his life.

256
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,333
"Pop, you hungry?"

257
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,467
( grunts )

258
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,699
"Pop, you cold?"

259
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,266
( grunts )

260
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,833
"Pop, how'd the Mets do?"

261
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,367
"Ah!"

262
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,333
And that's what killed
my relationship.

263
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,433
Well, that'll kill
any relationship,
if you can't communicate.

264
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:45,766
That's the key
to a relationship.

265
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,266
That's how you build intimacy,
through communication.

266
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,632
It's very important to talk

267
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,166
and listen to your partner
so you can both grow as a unit.

268
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,999
And when life throws you
little things,

269
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,133
you can really be prepared.

270
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:05,033
It's just talking
and talking and talking.

271
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,999
And I was listening to every
word 'cause I thought,

272
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,733
you know, there was a point.

273
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,966
There's no point.

274
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,599
You know how some people
hire maids, they hire nannies?

275
00:16:17,632 --> 00:16:20,100
I should've hired a gay guy
for her to talk to.

276
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,200
'Cause there were so many things
I just didn't care about.

277
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,133
"Should I reupholster
this couch or get a new one?

278
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,699
I don't know what to do
with this room.

279
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:29,733
What do you think?"

280
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:31,467
"Ramon, you're up!

281
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,699
Let's go,
you're on the clock."

282
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:44,799
It was a psychotic,

283
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,100
babbling conveyor belt
of nonsense.

284
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,766
"I went to get my nails done,
but they didn't have
the polish I want.

285
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,133
So they put on clear coat,
but it obviously has
a pink tinge to it.

286
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,666
Look at that.
Doesn't that look pink to you?

287
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:59,599
I told them to square off
the tips, but they round them.

288
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:02,666
I don't speak Korean.
How the hell am I supposed
to communicate?"

289
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,632
( screams )

290
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,033
Somebody help me!

291
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,833
And Ramon would come
running in.

292
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,566
( effeminate Spanish accent )
"What you do? You can't
talk to him like that.

293
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,899
His head will explode!"

294
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,033
"Why does she do that, Ramon?"

295
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,233
"I don't know, honey,
but I'm here. Now, come on.

296
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,133
You come with me now, baby.

297
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:36,899
I'm gonna sit you on the couch,
I pour you a little tequila,

298
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,566
we put on ESPN, you watch
the rednecks play poker.

299
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,100
You like that, papi, yes."

300
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:46,699
( sniffles )
"Thank you, Ramon.

301
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,699
I wish you had a vagina."

302
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,200
"I know, honey. So do I."

303
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,766
So we started therapy
soon after that.

304
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:19,200
I figured if I'm talking
to imaginary gay guys,

305
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:20,467
it's time to get help.

306
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,000
I went. We went to
the couple's therapy.

307
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,100
I sat there,
I looked at the guy, I said,

308
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,766
"All right, doc,
what do we do?"

309
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,266
"Well, Adam, you see,
I can't tell you what to do."

310
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,766
"Really? For $125 an hour,
could you put out cheese maybe?

311
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,766
Why don't you pull your beard,
look like you're thinking?

312
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,966
What do these diplomas mean,
Sigmund?"

313
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,666
He said, "Okay,
we're gonna play a game
called Total Honesty."

314
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,766
"Okay, this guy's a moron."

315
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,699
"What?"
"Nothing, just warming up."

316
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,266
So she looks at me
and she goes,

317
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,133
"Adam, you don't listen.
It's very frustrating.

318
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,666
I talk to you, I talk to you,
and talk to you,

319
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:11,467
and you don't listen.
You just don't listen."

320
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:15,833
"I know.

321
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,033
I'm trying, baby,
I really am, it's just that...

322
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,632
I don't care.

323
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,433
I don't want to
lie to you, honey.

324
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:32,933
You are the most
important person to me.

325
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:35,100
I love you,
I will support you,

326
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,566
I will take
a bullet for you, baby.

327
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:41,367
Just shut up,
could you, please?"

328
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,933
"You see, doctor?
This is what he does, he comes
to close to real emotion

329
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:45,100
and he makes a joke out of it,
because he can't--

330
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,200
and don't you laugh at him.

331
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,300
You're encouraging
this behavior.

332
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,066
We have very serious
problems here.

333
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,433
You know, I think
he might be homosexual.

334
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:54,566
He screams out the name Ramon
in his sleep, okay?"

335
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,799
The doctor did say something
I didn't get at the time,

336
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,933
but it proved to
be true later on.

337
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:09,100
He goes, "Adam,
see, the problem is

338
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,699
you've come from
two different backgrounds."

339
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:12,699
"Doctor, this is
a fascinating theory.

340
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,833
Possibly because we're not
brother and sister.

341
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:16,033
Did you ever think of that?"

342
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,833
'Cause, culturally,
it wasn't that big a stretch.

343
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:24,666
I'm Italian, Catholic,
she's Jewish,

344
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,632
and the values are the same.
It's food, family, and guilt.

345
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,933
Her family,
the guilt's better,

346
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,766
and my family,
the food's better.

347
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:38,100
'Cause Jewish food, man.
"Happy Hanukkah.

348
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:42,066
Here's your bowl of 'blech',
there you go.

349
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,866
Is the 'hakakch' fresh?

350
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,100
Everybody save room for...

351
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,966
( guttural hawking,
then spits )

352
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,333
You like our food, Adam?"

353
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:22,300
"Yeah, yeah, horseradish
and shit. This is wonderful.

354
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:28,766
You know,
if the bread was leavened,
it would ruin everything."

355
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:40,300
"We also eat bitter herbs."

356
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,766
"You people
have suffered enough.

357
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,233
Order a pizza, Jesus Christ."

358
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm sorry, I just always
wanted to say that to her,

359
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:55,367
and I never did.

360
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:04,433
I remember the food
at the holidays.

361
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:08,666
We used to go to her house
for that holiday they got
called Passover.

362
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:11,467
You leave the door open,
waiting for Elijah.

363
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,166
We were there all night.
This guy never showed.

364
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,400
I played along with them,
though. "Is that him?

365
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,367
Does Elijah have a Mercedes?

366
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,533
MD plates?
Dr. Elijah? No? Sorry."

367
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:37,300
Her mother was pissed.

368
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,266
You should've seen her
trying to defend me.

369
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,966
"It's okay, Ma,
he's a comedian."

370
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:46,766
"No, he's an asshole, okay?

371
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,699
He's in there with two yarmulkes
on his chest like a bra.

372
00:22:58,833 --> 00:22:59,799
He's got the dreidel out,

373
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:03,166
playing roulette
with your cousins.

374
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,367
They're betting on gimel,
it's a
shanda."

375
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,966
One of the cultural differences
that proved to be challenging

376
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:11,966
was, I learned this from her,

377
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,733
Jews are raised
to ask questions.

378
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,066
You have to ask questions
like, "Why? How come?

379
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,066
How much? That much?
Why should I spend that much?"

380
00:23:27,566 --> 00:23:29,599
And, Italians,
we don't want to ask questions

381
00:23:29,632 --> 00:23:32,100
'cause we don't want
any information.

382
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:36,733
"Look, I didn't see nothin',
I don't know nothin'.

383
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:40,833
Don't subpoena me,
all right?"

384
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,333
So the questions started
driving me crazy.

385
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,933
It was question
after question.

386
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,533
Morning, noon and night
with the questions.

387
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:52,733
It was like falling asleep with
a Spanish radio station on.

388
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,100
Yo quiero pregunta,
pregunta, pregunta.

389
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,833
Yo quiero pregunta,
pregunta, pregunta.

390
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:00,766
Hijole!

391
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,666
What is with
the questions, ladies?

392
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:06,266
Why do you think we possess
some mysterious knowledge

393
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
we're keeping from you?

394
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,632
We go to see a movie,
she's like,

395
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,066
"Now, who's that guy?"

396
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,733
"Did I write
this fucking thing?

397
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,599
I came in with you.
How the hell do I know
who that guy is?

398
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:24,367
What do you want me to do,
show up early?

399
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,933
Do me a favor, fast-forward.

400
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,833
She's gonna have questions
I need to know the answers to.

401
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:33,133
I don't know, she thinks
I'm smart or something."

402
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:39,367
And every guy I speak to
says the same thing,

403
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,433
"Yeah, well...

404
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,467
what are you gonna do?"

405
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,266
And there's nothing
you can do.

406
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,766
Nothing.

407
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,599
God designed
the dyadic unit for survival,

408
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:58,533
for procreation,
for achievement.

409
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,166
'Cause the rest of this world
doesn't care about you.

410
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,533
The rest of this world's gonna
tell you, "No, you can't."

411
00:25:05,566 --> 00:25:07,100
When you fall in love,
the person that believes in you

412
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:10,133
is gonna tell you,
"Of course you can."

413
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:15,033
Christopher Columbus
discovered a new world.

414
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:17,100
Think about that.
The prevailing
belief at that time

415
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,533
was the Earth is flat.

416
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:19,866
People were terrified.

417
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:22,100
"You're gonna sail off
the end of it into oblivion.

418
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,266
In the seas
are giant serpents

419
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,100
that are gonna
swallow you whole."

420
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,899
And Columbus didn't care.
He made that voyage anyway.

421
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:32,566
You know why? Mrs. Columbus
would not shut up, that's why.

422
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,833
And he filled up
three boats with guys

423
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,799
willing to take that risk.

424
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,200
He told them all, "Gentlemen,

425
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,999
this mission
is certain death."

426
00:25:46,033 --> 00:25:47,533
"I no care, Chris.

427
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:50,300
Her mother, she live with us.

428
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,533
No leave me here!"

429
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:06,966
So, you know what? But it works.
The design does work.

430
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,766
I achieved more
when I was with her

431
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,566
than I thought I ever could,
and she made me a better man.

432
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,933
And, for some reason,

433
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:13,766
I thought she was smarter
than me, but I learned this.

434
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,966
Gentlemen, your wife,
your girlfriend,

435
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,133
mother of your kids,
the one you'll take
that bullet for?

436
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,632
She's just as stupid as you,
you know that?

437
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,632
How smart can she be?
She picked you, so...

438
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,866
Life is scary.

439
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:30,766
Hold on to each other,
fuck when you can,

440
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,999
fight when you have to,

441
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,300
and ride it out.

442
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,500
And you wonder
why she left me.

443
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,999
"Fuck when you can,
fight when you have to?"

444
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:48,200
Yeah, let's get that
embroidered on a pillow.

445
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:53,400
That's really gonna
brighten up the family room,
you miscreant."

446
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,833
So she leaves, right?

447
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:04,100
It's all over.

448
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,599
I'm sitting in
my parent's basement.

449
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,833
I'm a grown man living
in my parent's basement.

450
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,599
I crawled inside a bottle
of Maker's Mark.

451
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,599
I stayed there
for about three weeks.

452
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,733
Oh, it's warm in Kentucky.

453
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,866
Middle of the night,
my father comes down the stairs,

454
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:23,599
he's wearing a robe,
he's got a Lucky Strike
and a baseball bat.

455
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:31,433
He takes one look at me
and he just goes,

456
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,566
"Ah.

457
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,966
Yup.

458
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,133
Ah."

459
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,632
"Thanks, Pop."

460
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,733
Sat down next to me,
grabbed the bottle.

461
00:27:54,766 --> 00:27:57,766
It's the first time I ever had
a drink alone with my father.

462
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,266
Took a hit, turned around
and just said,

463
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,632
"Women.
What are you gonna do?"

464
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,266
He said, "You know, son,

465
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,266
a married guy's gonna die
before his wife.

466
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,632
And a single guy is gonna die
before a married guy.

467
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:29,866
So, when it comes to death,
women are carriers."

468
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,599
"What?"
"Yes. I love your mother.

469
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,599
I love your mother
with all my heart,

470
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:47,066
but she is going to kill me."

471
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,266
"No, Pop, it was me,
I messed it up."

472
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,367
"You didn't mess nothing up.

473
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,400
What'd you do?
Did you yell? Ooh.

474
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:57,999
Let me guess,
you didn't listen."

475
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,799
"Yeah, how'd you know?"
"Psh. How'd I know?

476
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,933
I'll tell you something.
Women are very sensitive, okay?

477
00:29:06,966 --> 00:29:09,699
Very emotional.

478
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:13,666
They're kind,
they're nurturing.

479
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:15,500
They're beautiful,
ain't they?

480
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,733
And every one of them
is full of shit."

481
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,632
"What?"
"They're full of shit.

482
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,033
They don't want you
to talk to them.

483
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,933
They don't want you
to listen to them.

484
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:31,599
They want you
to agree with them.

485
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:33,266
And if you don't agree
with them,

486
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,999
they just keep talking
and talking and talking

487
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:38,666
until you do.

488
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:41,899
It's not a conversation.
It's erosion.

489
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:54,599
They will talk and talk,
and ask again,

490
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:58,933
rephrase, wait three days,
bring it up one more time,

491
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,233
till finally you just go,

492
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:01,899
'Fine.

493
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,933
You know what, honey?

494
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:09,266
Do whatever the hell
you want to do.'

495
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,166
And then she'll look at you
and say,

496
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,666
'See? I'm glad
we talked about it.'"

497
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,200
My parents--

498
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,733
my parents have been married
for 40 years.

499
00:30:21,766 --> 00:30:23,367
They fight.

500
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,766
My father hasn't
picked up the phone
in my house in 40 years.

501
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,066
Drives my mother crazy, man.

502
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,033
"Did you hear
the friggin' phone?"

503
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:33,133
"Yep. Leave it alone.
It'll stop."

504
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,333
"Why don't you answer it?"

505
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,899
"It's never good news,
that's why.

506
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:42,266
Someone's gonna ruin my day,

507
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,966
I'm gonna make them
work for it."

508
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,266
So I bought 'em
an answering machine.

509
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,966
I figured that'll solve
the problem.

510
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,200
My mother's like, "Joe,
I want you to leave the message.

511
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,999
I want people to hear
a man's voice

512
00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:55,733
( whispers )
when they call the house."

513
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,166
"All right.

514
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,766
What the hell is
this thing here, now?

515
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,766
'Push here to record
your greeting,

516
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,266
what your callers will...'"

517
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,266
Beep. "All right, look,

518
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,566
I ain't giving you a ride,
I ain't got any money,

519
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,400
I don't care who's dead,

520
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:20,033
and I ain't calling you back."

521
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,233
Beep.

522
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:32,933
That was on for three days
before she caught it.

523
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,266
And another week after that

524
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,300
'cause they couldn't
figure out

525
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,632
how to get it off.

526
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,599
They fight, but I know
they love each other.

527
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:49,566
After 40 years, my father
still holds my mother's hand.

528
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,333
Like, "Ma, he's yelling,
but he loves you.

529
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,933
He's still holding your hand."

530
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:56,467
"'Cause he's afraid I'm gonna
hit him, that's why."

531
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:03,367
We hit a bump this year.

532
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,367
My pop got cancer.

533
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,233
And I hope your family's
never faced with it,
but if you got to go through it,

534
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:10,632
you're quickly gonna learn
the character of the people
you come from,

535
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:12,200
and I was very proud of
my old man

536
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,866
'cause I panicked
when he told me.

537
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:16,632
I was on the road.
I called him in the hospital.

538
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,833
I said, "Pop, I just heard.
I'm coming, all right?"

539
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:20,566
"Don't worry,
this is nothing.

540
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,833
It's not like it used to be.
They got all kinds of
stuff there today.

541
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:27,333
They just knock this
right out."

542
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:28,933
"How you doing?"

543
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:32,632
"How am I doing?
I got a pipe in my pecker.
How's your day going?"

544
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,300
So we all showed up,
the whole family showed up.

545
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,632
Well, one of my brothers
couldn't be there

546
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,899
'cause something happened
and it wasn't his fault,

547
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:53,200
and it's never his fault,
but something always happens

548
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:55,699
and I shouldn't judge
because I don't know.

549
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:57,166
There's one in every family.

550
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,699
There's one
in every friggin' family.

551
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:01,266
And if you don't know
who I'm talking about,

552
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,100
it's you.

553
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,766
So, we're sitting
in the doctor's office

554
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,100
and the doctor's telling me
and my other brother,

555
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,533
"Look, I don't want
you boys to worry.

556
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:15,766
This cancer isn't hereditary.

557
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,467
This comes from one thing
and one thing only."

558
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,799
"Oh! Please say Jell-O.

559
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:24,266
Come on, Jell-O."

560
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,733
"No, cigarettes."

561
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:30,367
Fuck.

562
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:36,133
I'm all out of excuses.

563
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:38,100
So I quit.
I quit right then.

564
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:42,666
'Cause in that moment,
my parents got old
right in front of me.

565
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:45,833
My pop's 66,
but he's a hard 66.

566
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:49,566
He's got the cancer,
he had a 90% blockage
in his heart we had to fix.

567
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,866
He's a diabetic.

568
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:53,100
He shoots himself up
twice a day with this insulin

569
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,367
they make from
a lizard hormone.

570
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,166
It works,
his blood sugar's fine,

571
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,533
but in the afternoons
he likes to

572
00:33:58,566 --> 00:34:00,300
sun himself on a hot rock.

573
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:11,632
Keeps trying to sell me
auto insurance.

574
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:18,933
And my mother's at that age

575
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:21,266
where women start to
dress like Elvis.

576
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:32,533
You know the big rhinestone,
sequined, jump suit-y things?

577
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:35,833
And the hip is bad,

578
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,166
so she swivels
when she walks.

579
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:44,100
"Ma, are there any leftovers?"

580
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,300
"♪ Uh-huh "

581
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:57,233
They still live in the house
I grew up in.

582
00:34:57,266 --> 00:35:00,966
Except now it's got
that grandma house smell.

583
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,566
You know
the grandma house smell?

584
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,566
It's like moth balls
and disappointment, you know?

585
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,699
"Ma, is there any Lysol?"

586
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:13,933
"Yeah, it's on the shelf
next to the broken dreams."

587
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:25,799
So, came time for the chemo,

588
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,300
and I sat my pop down.

589
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,966
I called in every favor I had.

590
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:33,400
I got my hands on some money,
I greased who I had to grease.

591
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,100
We're in the garage,
and I told him, I said,

592
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,632
"All right, Pop, look,
it's all taken care of.

593
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:41,599
I got you to the best hospital
in the city, all right?

594
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:43,866
Don't ask me how,
don't ask me why,

595
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:46,533
but your name
is on the top of that list.

596
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:49,400
All I need you to do
is walk through that door

597
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,999
and I want you to beat this
thing down, you hear me?"

598
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,433
"Yeah, kid, thanks.

599
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:03,266
You stepped up, don't think
I don't notice that, huh?

600
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,899
Good man.

601
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,999
But we go for
this chemo thing, uh,

602
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,333
we're gonna go over here
by the house."

603
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,566
I said, "Pop, look at me,

604
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:16,000
I got you the best shot
we got at beating this."

605
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,300
"Yeah, I know son.

606
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:20,166
And, uh, looked at that
city hospital, I really did.

607
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,033
But this is gonna be
a two, three-month deal

608
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,833
and where you got to go,
it's got all those stairs

609
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:29,766
and your mother don't climb
the stairs that good no more,

610
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:32,699
so that can't work for us."

611
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:38,799
He's looking right down
the barrel at it,

612
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:43,699
and his priority is my mother
can't climb no stairs no more.

613
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,766
That's the same man made me
shovel the driveway

614
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:51,632
with a broken arm.

615
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,599
"Pop,
I can't hold the shovel."

616
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:06,300
"Stick it in your ass
and walk backwards."

617
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:17,266
And I got it.

618
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,666
In that moment, I got it.

619
00:37:18,699 --> 00:37:21,200
He's the head of the house.
That's his woman.

620
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,300
Whether that's right or wrong,
healthy or not,

621
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,200
he's gonna take care of her.

622
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,200
And that's how
he defines himself.

623
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:30,899
And I got that
from my old man, too.

624
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,133
That's why when she left,
I was a mess.

625
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,866
I had nowhere to go.
I didn't know what to do.

626
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:37,467
I was like one of
those sharks you see
on the Discovery Channel.

627
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,433
You know when they smack them
in the nose with a bang stick?

628
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:40,467
Like...

629
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,833
I started getting
panic attacks.

630
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,999
You ever get a panic attack?

631
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:51,733
Yeah, that's a nice way
to go through life.

632
00:37:51,766 --> 00:37:53,133
"What a lovely day."

633
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,733
( screams )

634
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,599
And the only way
you get rid of a panic attack

635
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:02,866
is you have to talk about it.

636
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:04,799
Yeah, I'm gonna call up
my friends.

637
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:05,799
"Hey, Philly.

638
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,733
I think I'm getting
panic attacks."

639
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,566
"Really? You ever think
you're a pussy?

640
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:12,533
Did you ever think of that?

641
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:15,933
I mean, I'm no doctor,
but you could be a pussy,

642
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:17,766
it's all I'm saying.

643
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:22,233
Well, it sounds like acute pussy
syndrome to me, sweetheart.

644
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,500
Check your urine.
Is it pink?"

645
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,999
I was a mess.

646
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:36,733
I could--
I went to see a shrink.

647
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:38,166
I'm such an Italian, too.

648
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,133
My friends are like, "So
how's it going with the shrink?"

649
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,100
"He didn't get
nothing out of me.

650
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,500
I love my mother,
I ain't gonna roll on her."

651
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,533
They put me on Zoloft.

652
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,966
That's fun.
Your mouth dries up,
you start shaking.

653
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:59,500
This is much better.

654
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,367
Oh, I can't wait
for the anal leakage.

655
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,666
This is...

656
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:12,999
That's what I need, is a wet ass
and a positive attitude.

657
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,566
That's just
what I'm looking for.

658
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:19,300
♪ It's a Zoloft life for me

659
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:29,733
I just had a bad year, man.

660
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:31,899
Did you guys have a good year
or a bad year?

661
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,233
( man coughs loudly )

662
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,100
How's the tuberculosis.
Is everything better?

663
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:36,733
Jesus.

664
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,933
What the hell was that?

665
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:46,300
You just coughed up a bar stool.
What was that?

666
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,933
( growling cough )

667
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,632
"Let's put this in the foyer.

668
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,632
It's from the mucus
collection."

669
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:06,233
Are you all right, pal?

670
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:07,433
You sure?

671
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:08,766
Check your nuts.
One of them dropped.

672
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:10,799
I think I heard something
hit the floor.

673
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:18,100
I tell you, I had a bad year.

674
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:19,999
Did you guys have a good year
or a bad year?

675
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:21,367
( crowd murmuring,
scattered cheers)

676
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,599
Oh, yeah. Yeah?

677
00:40:22,632 --> 00:40:24,333
You had a good year? Nice.

678
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,100
"We had a good year.

679
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,233
We all found Jesus

680
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,899
and the dog started
shitting diamonds."

681
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,599
I had an awful year.

682
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,400
I was watching the New Year's
countdown like this,

683
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:41,632
"Hurry up!

684
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:44,933
Let's go!"

685
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,999
And then it was Dick Clark
with the stroke.

686
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:49,200
"Eight, seven, seven, seven."

687
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:50,567
Oh, come on.

688
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:02,500
Somebody want to give
Dick a shove, please?

689
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:03,599
"Seven, six.

690
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:05,200
Happy 1988."

691
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,799
I believe in karma, though.
You believe in karma?

692
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:14,367
- Oh.
- ( cheering )

693
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,233
Do you ever think to yourself,
"What the hell did I do

694
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,599
in a past life to get the ride
I'm on now"?

695
00:41:19,632 --> 00:41:21,367
Did I give Lincoln
the theatre tickets?

696
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,833
What the hell did I do?

697
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:27,599
"Abe, front row, balcony.

698
00:41:27,632 --> 00:41:29,567
Take the wife.
It's on me. Go."

699
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,766
But I understand that you
shouldn't do the right thing

700
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:39,266
because you fear punishment
or you expect profit.

701
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,066
You should do the right thing
'cause the right thing

702
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,933
is the right thing to do.

703
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:43,933
Can I get an amen?

704
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:46,666
( cheers and applause )

705
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:48,966
Mm-hmm.

706
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:54,433
And it works. Karma works.

707
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:56,433
I got a girl now.

708
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:59,266
Oh, that's what daddy likes.

709
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:03,766
She's beautiful.

710
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,266
She gives me permission
to be positive.

711
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,100
It's very important for a guy
like me, 'cause I come from

712
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:10,833
people that don't know
what to do with happy.

713
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:12,266
You know when happy
shows up like,

714
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,666
"Hey, aren't we
having a good time?"

715
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:16,533
"Yeah, well, shit can happen."

716
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:24,899
And she's beautiful.

717
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:28,233
Ugh. The female form
is just enchanting.

718
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:30,433
Guys, think about your woman.

719
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:33,999
Everything is shaped nice,
it's all soft and tucked in,

720
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:38,233
and mysterious, and hair,
no hair, hair, no hair.

721
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,966
You ever see a naked guy?

722
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:44,467
Disgusting.

723
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,699
Aberrant patches of hair
just missing from it.

724
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,799
Two balls dangling down.

725
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,300
It looks like
a Christmas tree in January.

726
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,866
Just standing there
waiting for someone to put
it away, like...

727
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,699
"Come on, man, it's cold."

728
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,066
She's beau-- just the way
she arches her back

729
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,599
reaching for the orange juice
in the morning,

730
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:28,433
I want to tackle her right there
on the kitchen floor.

731
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:29,500
( high-pitched )
"You want some juice, baby?"

732
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:30,533
"Come here."

733
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:37,433
( high-pitched )
"What's the matter with you?"

734
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:38,599
"You're wearing
the red underwear.

735
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:41,166
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

736
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:47,400
Stay still."

737
00:43:50,033 --> 00:43:51,133
( grunts )

738
00:43:57,733 --> 00:44:00,233
Just find somebody to love
that loves you back.

739
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,632
Doesn't matter who it is,

740
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:04,400
your family ain't gonna like
them anyway, you know that.

741
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,533
Your family thinks
they know what's best for you.

742
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,133
Religion will tell you
who you can choose from.

743
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,599
Even the government.

744
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:10,599
The president
actually wants to make

745
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:11,866
a constitutional amendment

746
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,599
prohibiting gay marriage,
which goes against...

747
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:17,100
I don't know, the very
foundation of the country?

748
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:19,599
"All men are created equal.

749
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:21,433
Except these faggots
over here."

750
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:31,666
Did you read the thing
before you took the job?

751
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:32,766
Who cares?

752
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:35,632
Suck a dick, sing a song,
pay your taxes.

753
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,533
Just knock it off
with the parades.

754
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,699
Any gay people here?

755
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,533
We get it.
You're a festive bunch.

756
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:54,833
Knock it off.

757
00:44:58,632 --> 00:44:59,599
I like women.

758
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:00,766
You don't see me
tying up traffic

759
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,966
for the annual
pussy festival, do you?

760
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:09,233
Of course,
I'd hold it in the spring.

761
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,266
I  march in
the gay pride parade

762
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,699
every year in New York City.

763
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:16,933
Not for support.

764
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,133
I got to get across
Sixth Avenue to get home.

765
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,433
Every year,
it's the same thing.

766
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,599
"All right, Dorothy,
give me the sign.

767
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:26,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah."

768
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:32,367
My friend David's gay.

769
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,899
He's getting married
and his mother's upset

770
00:45:33,933 --> 00:45:35,533
that the guy's not Jewish.

771
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:42,733
Some people just have
a line in the sand.

772
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:45,999
I was at the engagement party.

773
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,066
His mother was drunk.

774
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,666
Like, "Well, apparently,

775
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:51,933
it's too much to ask that
the bride be circumcised."

776
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:05,833
You look at a group of people
that had faith,

777
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,766
it's got to be the Jews.

778
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,766
The Jews followed Moses
through the desert

779
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:14,033
for 40 years with no map.

780
00:46:14,066 --> 00:46:16,400
There had to be one guy
in the back, like,

781
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:19,999
"Hey, I don't think he knows
where he's going.

782
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,000
( exhales )

783
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,799
40 years?
What, are you kidding me?

784
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:35,599
I was ten
when we started this thing.

785
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,433
That footprint?
Mine, 15 years ago.

786
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:47,300
Circles.
We're walking in circles!

787
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,599
No, no,
don't shush me, Sheila.

788
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:52,033
Enough is enough.

789
00:46:52,066 --> 00:46:54,100
I don't give a damn
if he hears me or not.

790
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:57,233
You're lost, Moses,
you cock-eyed bastard.

791
00:46:59,966 --> 00:47:02,166
Get the bags.
We'll open a deli.

792
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,233
This is bullshit."

793
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,733
Don't get me wrong,
I believe in God,

794
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:19,632
I just hope he doesn't
write stuff down.

795
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,599
'Cause I made
a lot of deals with God,

796
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:23,133
and if I get audited...

797
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:28,933
He's gonna pull my file
and send down

798
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:31,166
some leg-breaking angel
to collect.

799
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,632
( imitates wings flapping )

800
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:36,533
"Excuse me, chuckle boy.

801
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,166
Let's review.

802
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,933
'Please don't let her
be pregnant,

803
00:47:44,966 --> 00:47:46,933
and I'll never do it again.'

804
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,599
'I'll never drink again.'

805
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:04,300
'I'll never drink again.'

806
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,200
'I'll never drink again.'

807
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,033
'Please don't let her
be pregnant,

808
00:48:12,066 --> 00:48:13,833
and I'll never drink again.'"

809
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:23,333
Yes. I believe in God.

810
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,966
I believe in the spiritual
precept of wholeness.

811
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:27,567
We're given
everything we need.

812
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,567
The answers lie within.

813
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,333
( deep voice )
Go within, my son.

814
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,100
I have no time
to meditate. None.

815
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:35,833
I live in New York City,
I have A.D.D.,

816
00:48:35,866 --> 00:48:39,433
I have a caffeine addiction,
I'm an American.

817
00:48:39,467 --> 00:48:40,933
We're not known
for our patience.

818
00:48:40,966 --> 00:48:43,333
We just started a war
without double-checking
the facts.

819
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,300
Are you kidding me?

820
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,400
"They're buying uranium
from Africa."

821
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:55,567
"Really?"

822
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,467
"That's what Randy told me.
Send them in."

823
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:03,266
And the world hates us.

824
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,100
The world can't stand us, man.

825
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:07,533
( French accent )
"Oh, those Americans.

826
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:11,300
You know they wash
themselves every day?"

827
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:17,766
'Cause the rest of the world
thinks Americans are arrogant.

828
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:19,533
And, you know...

829
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:20,966
fuck you.

830
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,433
Yeah, we're arrogant people.
This is a horrible country.

831
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,266
That's why everyone's coming
here for a better life.

832
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,033
How many people have
a timeshare in Yemen?

833
00:49:36,066 --> 00:49:38,200
Anyone?

834
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:42,266
Go during the stoning season.
It's fabulous.

835
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,699
Who needs Disneyland?

836
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:49,500
I was just in Florida, too.

837
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:51,500
My grandma passed away.

838
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:52,833
( audience sighs )

839
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:55,367
Oh, thank you.
She was 92 with one leg.

840
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,699
We saw it coming.

841
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,500
But my dopey cousins
are at the funeral like,

842
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:03,066
"Why?"

843
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:10,300
She's 92 with one leg.

844
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:13,233
Why? How about,
"What took so long?"

845
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:16,233
My grandmother's
last words were,

846
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:18,799
( rasping )
"Fucking finally."

847
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:28,933
She had everything wrong
with her.

848
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:30,599
Every system
was shutting down.

849
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:32,733
Parts were falling off
the woman.

850
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:34,333
She wouldn't go, man.

851
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,333
She was like a Dodge Dart.
You couldn't kill her.

852
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,400
The doctors were coming out of
her hospital room like...

853
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:46,066
Yeah.

854
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,467
Night before
they take her leg off,

855
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,599
I'm sitting
in her hospital room,

856
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,100
rubbing her little head.

857
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:57,133
She had that dandelion hair.

858
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:58,933
You know, it was white,
and there wasn't a lot of it,

859
00:50:58,966 --> 00:51:00,467
like a dandelion.

860
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,766
You just wanted to
go up behind her like,

861
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,467
"Make a wish."

862
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:18,533
( Italian accent )
"What you do to my hairs?"

863
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,632
I never felt so helpless
in all my life.

864
00:51:23,666 --> 00:51:24,699
She was comforting me.

865
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:26,433
I'm like,
"Grandma, what can I do?"

866
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:30,666
She's like, "Adamo,
there's nothing you can do.

867
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:33,666
It's not you, Adamo.
It's God, you know?

868
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:36,866
God, he wants me, just,
uh, not all at once."

869
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,833
So she finally passes away,
we go to the funeral.

870
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:48,266
And if you've never
seen Italians

871
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,433
lay their dearly departed
to rest,

872
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:51,066
it's very tasteful.

873
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,599
Flowers all over the body.

874
00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:59,200
Big horseshoe flowers,

875
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:01,567
like she won the Kentucky Derby
or something.

876
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,699
"Good luck in Heaven."

877
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:11,632
I'm standing over the body,

878
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:13,200
tears are falling out
of my eyes.

879
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,966
My dopey cousin leans in like,

880
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,567
"She looks good, huh?

881
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,933
Not too much makeup,
they sewed the mouth straight.

882
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:21,866
This is beautiful work
we're looking at here."

883
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,966
"What the fuck
is wrong with you?"

884
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:30,599
"What? She looks peaceful.

885
00:52:30,632 --> 00:52:31,966
That's all I'm trying
to tell you."

886
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,933
"Of course she looks peaceful.
She's dead, you idiot.

887
00:52:37,966 --> 00:52:39,300
What'd you expect her
to look like?

888
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:46,599
Like a beaver getting hit
by a truck?

889
00:52:46,632 --> 00:52:48,766
It's a funeral.
It's a somber occasion.

890
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,200
How many times have you heard,
'How was the funeral?'

891
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,966
'Rowdy. She got up.' What?"

892
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,266
Did you ever get
a good look at your family
and think to yourself,

893
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,300
"If I wasn't related to them,

894
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,300
I'd have nothing to do
with these people"?

895
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:11,766
We're back at the house,
he's eating, he's like,

896
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,899
( smacks lips )
"This prosciutto's fresh.

897
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:15,467
That's the way she would've
wanted it."

898
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,799
"No. You know what
she would've wanted?

899
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,766
You dead and her here
eating the prosciutto.

900
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:21,100
That's what
she would've wanted.

901
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,933
She never liked you,
jackass."

902
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:27,133
They're lunatics.

903
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:28,567
Absolute lunatics.

904
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:29,899
My other cousin
comes up to me, he's like,

905
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:30,933
"Look, I understand this

906
00:53:30,966 --> 00:53:33,933
is a very stressful time
for all of us.

907
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:35,632
The sadness is upon us.

908
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:41,467
Maybe you want some ecstasy?"

909
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,400
I said,
"I can't even have dairy.

910
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:51,899
What, are you kidding me?"

911
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:55,833
He goes,
"Look, I got something here,

912
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,266
gonna make you see
the big picture.

913
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,799
Really gonna open up your eyes
about a lot of things, okay?

914
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:04,533
I got acid."

915
00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:06,567
"Acid? What, did you just
get out of a time warp?

916
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:08,200
Who the hell has acid?"

917
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:12,766
"The only thing is,
you got to be careful.

918
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:14,367
See, there's good trips
and there's bad trips.

919
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,599
Whatever's on your mind
when you come onto the acid,

920
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:18,033
that's the kind of trip
you're gonna have."

921
00:54:18,066 --> 00:54:20,599
"I don't want
any of this, okay?

922
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,266
I don't need my mortgage
coming to life.

923
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,300
Please, I just...

924
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,766
It's bad enough it's on
my back for 30 years,

925
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:31,133
I don't need it
sitting on the couch
talking to me."

926
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:34,766
"I'm never getting any smaller,
you know that.

927
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:37,467
I'm not getting any smaller."

928
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,833
"My savings is melting!"

929
00:54:45,666 --> 00:54:48,833
They're out-- my family's
out of their minds.

930
00:54:48,866 --> 00:54:50,567
I got an Uncle Tony.

931
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:52,933
We call him
"Uncle 8 o'clock."

932
00:54:52,966 --> 00:54:54,100
Every time he comes
over to our house,

933
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:55,100
"Hi, Uncle Tony."

934
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:56,266
"Look, if anybody asks,

935
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,467
I've been here since
8 o'clock, all right?"

936
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,433
He's always got a scam,
Uncle Tony.

937
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:04,766
When he wants to
mail a letter,

938
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,533
he puts the address
he wants it to go to

939
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:08,266
where the return address goes,

940
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,766
and throws it in the mailbox
without a stamp.

941
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,999
It gets marked
"insufficient postage"

942
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,300
and sent to
the return address.

943
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:23,033
I'm like, "Uncle Tony,
you know, that's mail fraud.

944
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:24,266
"Nah, nah."

945
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,100
That's brilliant.
What, are you kidding me?

946
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:29,599
Male fraud is like a chick

947
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,100
with a dick or something.

948
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,933
You know how cool
my Uncle Tony was?

949
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:43,367
He used to drive me to school.

950
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,100
He would pull over five blocks
before we got there,

951
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:47,266
let me get behind the wheel

952
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,300
so the kids could see me
rolling up.

953
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,033
I was 12.

954
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,100
He'd pick me up after school.

955
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:57,066
He had this giant
Buick Electra.

956
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,166
And he smoked those
De Nobili cigars. They stunk.

957
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,133
They were like Jersey
in a wrapper, just...

958
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,933
( man boos )

959
00:56:05,966 --> 00:56:07,066
Man: Yes!

960
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,266
He's like, "What'd they
learn you in school today?"

961
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,933
"Well, Uncle Tony,
they told us

962
00:56:13,966 --> 00:56:15,933
if you give a man a fish,
he eats for a day.

963
00:56:15,966 --> 00:56:17,599
But if you teach
a man to fish,

964
00:56:17,632 --> 00:56:19,666
he eats for the rest
of his life."

965
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:21,866
"All right, that's wrong.

966
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:23,133
You give a man a fish,

967
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,966
that man owes you
a fish and a half.

968
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:31,599
Every day
he don't pay you back,

969
00:56:31,632 --> 00:56:34,300
it goes up another
half a fish.

970
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:36,599
You don't get no fish
a couple, three weeks,

971
00:56:36,632 --> 00:56:37,766
you got to
break his rod and reel

972
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:38,966
and send a message,
kid, all right?

973
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:41,433
Who are you, Mrs. Paul,

974
00:56:41,467 --> 00:56:43,666
giving away all this fish
for God's sake?

975
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:46,266
Sink his boat.
That'll get his attention.

976
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,266
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old...

977
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,500
to a woman who was 38.

978
00:56:57,533 --> 00:56:59,233
Hold your applause.

979
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:01,533
( light applause )

980
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,599
I had nothing to do with it.

981
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:04,899
There's a knock on the door.

982
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:07,433
"Hello?"

983
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,100
"You Adam?

984
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:10,933
Uncle Tony says
Happy Birthday.

985
00:57:10,966 --> 00:57:12,632
Stay still."

986
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:22,333
Two seconds later,
I'm standing there

987
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:24,433
in this confused
state of euphoria

988
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:25,866
and the phone rings.

989
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:27,233
( imitates phone ringing )

990
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:32,166
"Hello?"

991
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,533
( laughs )

992
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,699
"Don't tell your mother."

993
00:57:48,133 --> 00:57:50,433
I go to see him now,
he denies everything.

994
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,766
Denies everything.

995
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:52,766
"I don't know what
you're talking about.

996
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,100
I don't know
what this person is

997
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:55,200
or where you get
these stories from.

998
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:56,632
Get out of here.
My grandkids are here.

999
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:59,400
Knock it off."

1000
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:02,632
I know he's different now
he's got grandkids.

1001
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,632
My girlfriend and I are
talking about having a baby.

1002
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:07,033
Well, she talks about it
and I black out.

1003
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,467
I don't know what kind of
father I'm gonna be.

1004
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,799
And we're all products
of our parents.

1005
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,200
All your mother's traits
are in the egg

1006
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:16,599
and all your father's traits
are in the sperm.

1007
00:58:16,632 --> 00:58:17,966
And, if I know my parents,

1008
00:58:17,999 --> 00:58:20,799
that sperm and egg
had a fight.

1009
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:21,933
My mother's egg--

1010
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:25,567
"I have been waiting
for you for 28 days.

1011
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,666
You're late.
Where have you been?"

1012
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:28,000
"Don't start with me.

1013
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:32,367
I have been swimming
my ass off out there.

1014
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,866
I'm sitting in traffic,

1015
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:37,799
some guy's tail's waving
in my face.

1016
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,500
There's a recessive gene
in front of me

1017
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,699
doing this shit."

1018
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,766
Yeah, so I don't know.

1019
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,433
I don't know what kind of
father I'm gonna be,

1020
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,999
but I'll tell you one thing,

1021
00:58:59,033 --> 00:59:03,200
that kid's gonna shovel
the driveway, damn it.

1022
00:59:03,233 --> 00:59:04,567
Thanks for coming to see me,
folks.

1023
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:05,733
( cheering and applause)

1024
00:59:05,766 --> 00:59:06,799
Thank you.

1025
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,632
( music playing )

1026
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,133

( music fades )

1028
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,367
I've had it with all of you.

1029
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,766
Thank you so much
for being a part

1030
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:09,300
of this night for me, folks.
I really appreciate it.

1031
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,100
Get home safe
and just go home and fuck

1032
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:13,300
while you
still love each other.

1033
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,266
Good night, folks.
Take care.
