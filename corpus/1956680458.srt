1
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:15,014
(pensive music)

2
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:25,057
(Leigh gasping)
        (pensive music)

3
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:18,077
(door latching)
        (pensive music)

4
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,682
- Ryan?

5
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:24,516
(hand banging)

6
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,818
Ryan?

7
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,586
Hey, it's me, open the door.

8
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,525
Ryan?

9
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,226
(pensive music)
      (video game beeping)

10
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:39,298
(pensive music)
       (thunder rumbling)

11
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:06,385
(door rattling)
        (ominous music)

12
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,737
(keys jingling)

13
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,775
(engine rumbling)

14
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:39,611
(animals calling)

15
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,489
(Leigh groaning)

16
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:58,897
(bird chirping)
        (pensive music)

17
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,904
(plastic rustling)

18
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:48,647
(phone ringing)

19
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,970
(phone chimes)

20
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,116
- [Voicemail] Hey Dad, just
  wondering where you are.

21
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:26,752
Looks like you didn't
     come home last night,

22
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,054
but you should know Mom's
   pretty pissed about it.

23
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,023
I just hope everything's okay.

24
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,527
Just give me a call.

25
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,599
(Leigh vomiting)

26
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,439
(birds chirping)

27
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:52,511
(clock ticking)

28
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,840
(water running)

29
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:36,822
(Leigh whimpering)

30
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,845
(engine rumbling)

31
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,221
- Hey.

32
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,493
It's best not to mention
    last night, all right?

33
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,963
It would just complicate things.

34
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,166
- Well, who was he?

35
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,200
- I don't know.

36
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,704
He was probably lookin'
    for somethin' to steal.

37
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,573
- Are you okay?

38
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:30,976
- Yeah, I'm all right.

39
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,911
It's not as bad as it looks.

40
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:37,649
- What happened to him?

41
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:41,286
- He, he ran off
     right after you left.

42
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,221
- I would have stayed.

43
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,890
- No.

44
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:48,260
You did the right thing. I
 didn't want you gettin' hurt.

45
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,160
Hey?

46
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,131
I know you would have.

47
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,133
Thank you.

48
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,942
(shop bell dings)

49
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:09,214
- You must be Leigh.

50
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,815
- Where's Officer Boyd?

51
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,552
- Officer Boyd is no
  longer with the department.

52
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,154
I'm your new probation
     officer, Ryan.

53
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,889
Nathan Parrish.

54
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,790
- Hi.

55
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,092
- Can I get you something?

56
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:21,927
- Oh, we won't be long.

57
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,761
Thank you though.

58
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:23,929
- Bring him a coke.

59
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,617
Is everything all right?

60
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,301
- Yeah, just got a
      lot goin' on today.

61
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,772
- [Nathan] How are things Ryan?

62
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,207
- Fine.

63
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,576
- Broken any laws
      since last check in?

64
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,311
- No.

65
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:40,045
- [Nathan] Anymore fights?

66
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,146
- [Ryan] No Sir.

67
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,015
- You the one that hit your mom?

68
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:46,952
- It was an accident at work.

69
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:47,852
- That true?

70
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:49,321
- Yeah.

71
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,221
Yes Sir.

72
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,062
- What do you do when
     your mom's at work?

73
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,763
- He works at the shop with me.

74
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,598
- Where's that?

75
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,231
- Tiller's Auto.

76
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,166
- Husband's?

77
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,200
- Ex.

78
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:03,835
It's mine now.

79
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,668
He's not involved.

80
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,870
- Why not?

81
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,272
- 'Cause he's in jail.

82
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,677
- Hm.

83
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,913
Like father like son, huh?

84
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,350
Drugs, alcohol?

85
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,852
- No Sir.

86
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,723
- It's better that
       you tell me now.

87
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,859
(patrons chattering)

88
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,831
- He's a good kid.

89
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,434
- You blinded a boy
      in his left eye.

90
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,036
- The kid was pickin' on him
 about his dad bein' sent off.

91
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,337
Supposed to not fight back?

92
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,672
- I got folders full of people

93
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,007
with reasons for what they did.

94
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,042
It doesn't put the
     skin back on the cat.

95
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,280
File has a note from the court,

96
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,017
says that you're behind
    on your restitution.

97
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,984
- Yeah.

98
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,553
- Now if you don't get that paid

99
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,121
it's gonna be a hell of a
   time clearin' his record.

100
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,389
- Things have been tight.

101
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,790
I'll catch up.

102
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,407
- I've been doin' this
    a long time Miss Tiller.

103
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,275
Good kids don't end up here.

104
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,914
- He doesn't know you.

105
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,888
You mean to pee on that cup?

106
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,994
Atta boy.

107
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,897
(engine rumbling)

108
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,074
(doors slamming)

109
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:51,843
(wind whistling)

110
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,021
- Must be nice bein'
      the boss's kid.

111
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,090
Sleep late, ramble in whenever.

112
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,962
- [Leigh] You good?

113
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,864
- Hey, I got a truck over
   here that needs your help.

114
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,268
- What's wrong with it?

115
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,403
- [Rey] You tell me, kid.

116
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,841
(pensive music)

117
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:41,392
(keyboard keys clacking)
    (pensive music)

118
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,386
(door unlatching)

119
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,223
What's up with Ryan?

120
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,359
- Nothin', just...

121
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,997
we had that meeting with
    the PO this mornin'.

122
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,831
- Is everything okay?

123
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,532
- It's fine.

124
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,335
It's nothin'.

125
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,470
- [Rey] Bullshit.

126
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,975
- I was, I was workin' too fast.

127
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,277
You know, took a little fall.

128
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,412
I'm all right.

129
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,683
- Who did that?

130
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,418
- There was just, there
   was a break in last night.

131
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,189
Some junkie probably
 thinkin' the place was empty.

132
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,590
I guess I startled him.

133
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,292
It's not a big deal, all right?

134
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,961
He lost interest as soon

135
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,930
as he realized it
     wasn't an easy score.

136
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,164
- Did you call the cops?

137
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,098
Maybe we could pull the
    tapes in the cameras.

138
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,200
- [Leigh] Like I said,

139
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,301
it's not a big deal.
 - Leigh, don't do somethin'--

140
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,602
- Just let it go.

141
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:01,606
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,408
I know you're just...

143
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,315
It's just a break in, all right?

144
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:14,352
We don't need a bad reputation

145
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,455
with the few
     customers we got left.

146
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,996
- Hey, your dad came by.

147
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,368
- When?

148
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,269
- Earlier today.

149
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,308
If you need anything,
     don't hesitate to ask.

150
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:42,380
(door latches)
        (pensive music)

151
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,556
(computer thuds)

152
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:56,628
(pensive music)

153
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,516
(trunk slams)

154
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:56,587
(birds chirping)

155
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:05,363
(children chattering)
     (dog barking)

156
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,609
(police siren)

157
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,693
- What are you doin' out here?

158
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,095
- You ever do that
     again I'll report you.

159
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,430
- I'm a year from
     forced retirement kid,

160
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,265
what do you think
    they're gonna do to me?

161
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,402
What happened to you?

162
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:45,770
- What do you want?

163
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,241
- I came by earlier.

164
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,211
I know that Ryan's
 appointment was this mornin'.

165
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,078
- He's fine.

166
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,547
- That Parrish is
       a pain in the ass.

167
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,482
- I said he's fine.

168
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,254
- I was thinkin' that maybe
Ryan could come see me sometime,

169
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,223
take him off your hands
    for a couple hours.

170
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,524
- I gotta go.

171
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,226
(engine starting)

172
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:10,661
- Would you at least tell him
 that I was askin' after him?

173
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,632
- I'll see you around, Dad.

174
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,202
- Well, see you around.

175
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,239
(engine rumbling)

176
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,214
(cellphone chiming)

177
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,387
(pensive music)

178
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:04,649
(thunder rumbling)
       (gentle music)

179
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:21,732
(rain pattering)
       (thunder rumbling)

180
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:27,839
(engine rumbling)

181
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:35,246
- How come we never
     take your police car?

182
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,547
- [Richard] 'Cause
     you aren't big enough

183
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,449
to ride in the front yet.

184
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,283
- So?

185
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,518
I'll ride in the back.

186
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,453
- [Richard] The back
     is for bad guys only.

187
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,472
(radio static crackling)

188
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:46,490
- [CB Radio] Hey Richard,
   you there? (radio static)

189
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,427
I got a situation I
   could use your help with.

190
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,896
- [Richard] Ain't really
    a good time for it.

191
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,631
- [Man Whispering] ... the
   place on Old Broughton.

192
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,732
Right.

193
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,435
Hm.

194
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,771
I gotta make a quick
    stop before dinner, kid.

195
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,842
(thunder rumbling)

196
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,745
(engine rumbling)

197
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,249

("The Journey")

199
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:30,528
¶ Down the dark
     highway, I travel on ¶

200
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,532
¶ To places I can't stay ¶

201
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:37,635
¶ Like the tide,
       I'm pulled along ¶

¶ Let Truth show me the way ¶

204
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,858
(pensive music)

205
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,561
- Come on, man.

206
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,629
- Hey, come on.

207
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,496
- Just let go of me.

208
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,330
- Hey, you look good.

209
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,331
- Just get the...

210
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,532
(elbow slaps)
         (Colt groans)

211
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,600
- [Colt's Friend] What
     the fuck was that?

212
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,436
- God damn it, man.
      - Fuck!

213
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:17,508

00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,680
(Leigh panting)

215
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,549
(Leigh screams)

216
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,984
- [Customer] Ma'am?

217
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:28,786
- I'm sorry, what?

218
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,855
- Do I have to do it all now?

219
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:33,958
- Oh, uh...

220
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,863
It looks like you
       could wait a month

221
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,599
or two on the axles if you want.

222
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:57,915
- Hey.

223
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:00,818
Sorry.

224
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:03,854
- What is it?

225
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,723
- Hoffman's called again.

226
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:06,991
- [Leigh] I'll handle it.

227
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:07,925
- They're gonna quit
      fillin' our orders.

228
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,761
- I said I'll fuckin' handle it.

229
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,475
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

230
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,780
- Why don't you take
      off early today?

231
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,449
Go soak in the tub or somethin'.

232
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,384
- You sure?

233
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:38,823
- Hell of a lot better than
  you yellin' at me all day.

234
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,492
- Yeah, all right.

235
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,528
Sounds nice.

236
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,368
I'll be straight tomorrow.

237
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,836
- I know you will.

238
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,974
(engine rumbling)

239
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,913
- [Ryan] What were
       you arguin' about?

240
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,548
- What?

241
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,018
- With the man who broke in.

242
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,521
- Uh, I wasn't arguin'.

243
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,956
I was tellin' him to leave.

244
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,826
- It sounded like you
   were fightin' about money.

245
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,728
- No, he was high.

246
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,697
He wasn't makin' any sense.

247
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:20,664
- He used to work with Dad.

248
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:21,866
- Ryan.

249
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:22,800
- [Ryan] Why did you
    say you didn't know him?

250
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,935
- Can we just drop it please?

251
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,645
Look, all that stuff
      with your father...

252
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,516
it's behind us, all right?

253
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:42,019
I want it to stay that way.

254
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,092
- Where are we goin'?

255
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,029
- I need to take
       care of soemthin'.

256
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:57,101
You're gonna spend a few
  hours with your grandfather.

257
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,682
(birds chirping)

258
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:20,991
- How you doin' kid?

259
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:21,892
- Good.

260
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:25,696
- See that bird right there?

261
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,897
- [Ryan] Yeah.

262
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:27,932
- It's a pheasant,
       I just got it.

263
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,534
Got some homing pigeons too.

264
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,040
Tell you what Ryan, why
 don't you go up to the house.

265
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,708
I just made some iced tea.

266
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,777
Why don't you see if there's
anything on TV you wanna watch,

267
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,011
I'll be right with you.

268
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,048
- Okay.

269
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,726
- I don't let him
    watch anything R-rated.

270
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,861
- Okay.

271
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,028
- And nothin' too violent.

272
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,029
- Right.

273
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,233
I was surprised
       to get your call.

274
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,203
- Well, some time to
      myself sounded nice.

275
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:07,671
- Hm.

276
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,607
I've had about as much
     of that as I care for.

277
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,048
- I'll be back in a few hours.

278
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:21,051
- Take your time.

279
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,159
(Leigh knocking)

280
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:33,797
- What's up?

281
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:36,901
Rough week?

282
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:49,046
This is stronger shit
     than you're used to.

283
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,047
- Thanks.

284
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:50,981
- Thank you.

285
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,149
- How much should I take?

286
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,187
- Uh, how much trouble you
 lookin' to get off your back?

287
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,824
Those are fives.

288
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,126
You start with one,
      you'll be good.

289
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,027
- Hey?

290
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,164
You uh, you mind if
     I hang out for a bit?

291
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,267
I just need someplace quiet.

292
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,904
- Yeah, uh, knock yourself out.

293
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,211
Oh, uh, I wanted
       to tell you I uh,

294
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,581
I finish my parol in August.

295
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,349
I think I might head
      back to Michigan.

296
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,219
I'll set you up with a new guy.

297
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,688
- You tell Jesse?

298
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,657
- Your ex and I don't
     really chat anymore.

299
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,159
You?

300
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,067
(Reed sighs)

301
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:45,102
This place is a mess.

302
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:52,109
(pensive music)

303
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,026
- Hey, did you
       um, did you notice

304
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,295
if I was wearin' a necklace
  when I came in here?

305
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,365
- No, I don't think so.

306
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,903
- Yeah, okay.

307
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,239
Just call me if you find it.

308
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,715
Okay.

309
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:37,755
Okay.

310
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,068
- Can I help you?

311
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,704
- Yeah, I was uh, I
    was in here last night.

312
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,072
- Yeah, I remember.

313
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:57,241
I spent a half hour
  cleanin' up blood and glass.

314
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,076
- Do you um, did
       you happen to find

315
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,412
a necklace while you
      were cleanin' up?

316
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:02,312
Silver?

317
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,159
Okay.

318
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:15,993
Thanks.

319
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:20,297
(objects rustling)

320
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,699
It's not in here.

321
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,200
- Then I guess I didn't find it.

322
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:26,336
- Please, it's um, it's
    a little silver chain,

323
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,738
had a wrench on it.

324
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,651
It's really important.

325
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:31,563
- Well, you maybe
       you should check

326
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:33,475
with that fella you
     were grindin' your
     snatch on last night.

327
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:53,097
(engine rumbling)

328
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:04,308
(children playing)

329
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,327
(Leigh knocking)

330
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:29,933
(shots firing in the distance)

331
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,373
- That's not bad.

332
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:40,544
You see how the water's
   runnin' toward the creek?

333
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:44,815
You always wanna watch
     a suspect's feet.

334
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,250
See if he's about to run.

335
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:50,053
You see which foot
       his weight is on,

336
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,288
then lead him that
      way just by a hair.

337
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,023
(shot firing)
       (water splashing)

338
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,057
- Time to go Ryan.

339
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,795
- Just let me try one more time.

340
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:58,495
- Ryan.

341
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,235
- We'll get 'em next time.

342
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,906
- You haven't changed a bit.

343
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,209
- Hey.

344
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,143
Hey!

345
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,311
What's stuck in your craw?

346
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:17,047
- Not half a day with the kid

347
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,116
and you got him picturing
  bullets goin' through heads.

348
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,701
- He said he'd never
      shot a revolver.

349
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:22,285
- [Leigh] And you thought
  it was your job to fix that?

350
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,254
- I think that he hadn't
  seen his dad in three years.

351
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,389
What's goin' on with you?

352
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:28,292
- You're a poison.

353
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,560
That's what's goin' on.

354
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:33,463
- The boy needs to know how
  to take care of himself,

355
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,432
things at the shop
      bein' how they are.

356
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,508
- Beatin' around the
     bush doesn't suit you.

357
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,443
- Ryan told me there
      was a break in.

358
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,378
- Boy needs to keep
      his mouth shut.

359
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,313
- Easy.

360
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,981
He was scared.

361
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,382
- He say anything else?

362
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,418
- He didn't seem much
     for talkin' about it.

363
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,353
Why didn't you tell me?

364
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,522
- 'Cause it doesn't concern you.

365
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,057
- You forget what I do?

366
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,493
- No.

367
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,928
No, I didn't forget.

368
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,365
- If you got somethin'
     to say, say it.

369
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,438
- This was a mistake.

370
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,210
(door slams)

371
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,545
- [Richard] Ryan?

372
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,585
- Hey.

373
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,053
- What?

374
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,455
- I'm just lookin' out for you.

375
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,324
- By makin' sure I
      can't defend myself?

376
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:37,027
- By makin' sure you have
   the right influences.

377
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,996
- Well, I can make
       my own choices.

378
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:41,465
- Yeah, you've done a real
   great job of that so far.

379
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:47,471
(door slams)

380
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:48,505
Shit.

381
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,075
Ryan?

382
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:57,114
(pensive music)

383
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,650
Hey, have you seen my necklace?

384
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:27,044
(objects clattering)

385
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:45,529
(crickets chirping)
      (pensive music)

386
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:05,148
(train horn blaring)

387
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,703
(trunk slams)

388
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:57,701
(engine rumbling)

389
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,577
- [Travis] Hey Mom, Dad's home.

390
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,648
- [Dani] Tell him to sleep
   on the fucking couch.

391
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:16,453
(Leigh gasps)

392
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,256
- [Travis] Hey
       Dad, you in there?

393
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:25,262
Dad?

394
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:31,568
(Travis grimaces)

395
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,805
Oh fuck, no.

396
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,474
Mom!

397
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,077
Mom!

398
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,148
(Leigh panting)

399
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:47,477
(thunder cracking)
       (rain pattering)

400
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:57,654
(girl humming)
        (rain pattering)

401
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,796
- What are you drawin'?

402
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,366
It's a circle.

403
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:10,867
It gets bigger and bigger.

404
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,736
Like a fingerprint.

405
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,839
(glass shattering)

406
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:20,911
(pensive music)

407
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,550
Hey.

408
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,362
(shot firing)

409
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:51,808
(Rey knocking)

410
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,642
- Leigh?

411
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:54,277
You in there?

412
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,980
(door unlatching)

413
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,349
Oh, thank God.

414
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,817
I've been tryin' your cell.

415
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,452
We had another break in.

416
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,790
Did you sleep here?

417
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,758
- Shit.

418
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,295
- [Rey] Customers, no customers,
we gotta call the police.

419
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,397
- There um, there
       wasn't a break in.

420
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,719
- What?

421
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,703
- I was lookin' for somethin'.

422
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:21,838
I meant to clean up.

423
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,240
I guess I just fell asleep.

424
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:33,984
Rey.

425
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:35,285
- [Rey] I'm goin' out.

426
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:43,927
(tires on gravel)

427
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,307
- Spring cleanin'?

428
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,775
- I thought I made
      myself pretty clear.

429
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,912
- [Richard] I'm starting to
remember why we don't talk much.

430
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,748
(Leigh sighs)

431
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,617
- I can think of plenty of
  reasons we don't talk much.

432
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,887
- Jesus kid, I've seen priests
 less hung up on old sins.

433
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,723
- You just come by to complain
 about how you're treated?

434
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:17,727
- Where's Ryan?

435
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,795
- [Leigh] He's not here.

436
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:27,537
- The other day when I saw
  you out by the trailer park,

437
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,808
you never said what you
    were doin' out there.

438
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,842
- The truck was over heatin'.

439
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,744
I was lettin' it cool.

440
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:36,546
- Horse shit.

441
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,447
Try harder.

442
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,949
- I don't know what
      you want from me,

443
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,384
so if you don't mind...

444
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,753
- A fella turned
       up dead yesterday,

445
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,922
about 100 yards from where
   your truck overheated.

446
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:47,724
- [Leigh] Hm, that so?

447
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:49,793
- Name was Cobb.

448
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,329
- That supposed
       to mean somethin'?

449
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,863
- It ought to.

450
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,799
He used to run stolen cars
   through here with your ex.

451
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,801
- Well, if you think Jesse
  had somethin' to do with it,

452
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,469
you know where to find him.

453
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,372
- Tell me you don't know
    how he got dead, Leigh.

454
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,473
- You know what?

455
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,908
Fuck you.

456
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,911
- You put that God damn tire
  down and you look at me!

457
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:10,847
(pensive music)

458
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,091
(Leigh sniffles)

459
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:22,092
Jesus Christ.

460
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:27,764
- I don't know what to do.

461
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:30,867
- What the fuck happened?

462
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,870
- He broke into the shop.

463
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,806
He musta not known I was here.

464
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,945
When he saw me he
      just, he went crazy,

465
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,046
like he was on somethin'.

466
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:46,616
And I grabbed a wrench.

467
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:48,952
- You...

468
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:53,957
Where's the wrench?

469
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:54,891
- It's gone.

470
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,027
- Why didn't you report it?

471
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,830
- I don't know.

472
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,066
I mean I panicked.

473
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,470
I, I thought if they
      made the connection

474
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,906
with Jesse they'd take the shop.

475
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,912
- Why did you take the
   body back to the trailer?

476
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,013
- 'Cause he has a family.

477
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,849
- Who the fuck cares?

478
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,719
- I couldn't just
   disappear a man like that.

479
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,154
Leave his people wonderin'.

480
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:25,488
- Well that's great Leigh.

481
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,790
Now his people know.

482
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,024
- I know it was stupid.

483
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,459
- You're damn right
      it was stupid.

484
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,661
You bury it, ya burn it.

485
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,863
Shit, you dump it in a lake.

486
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:34,664
- This isn't your problem.

487
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,434
- You're my daughter.

488
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:38,935
This is my problem.

489
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,804
- I don't want your help.

490
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,205
- You're a master criminal now?

491
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,607
Hm?

492
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,875
You cover your tracks
     pretty thoroughly?

493
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,210
- [Leigh] I didn't say that.

494
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,945
- What about that camera
   up on the wall behind me?

495
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,713
Is that connected to anything?

496
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:51,981
- No.

497
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:52,816
- You think that he
     took any of your skin

498
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:53,983
with him to the morgue?

499
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,920
What about fingerprints,
    what about hair?

500
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:58,855
Did anybody see
      you actin' strange?

501
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,624
You tell me they're not gonna
 find your DNA on his pecker.

502
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,525
- Just stop it!

503
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:05,962
(Richard sighs)

504
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,063
- Leigh.

505
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,771
- What do I do?

506
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,641
- You the prayin' kind?

507
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,482
I'll go see what I can learn.

508
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,087
I need a fuckin' drink.

509
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:36,059
(somber music)

510
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:45,235
(pensive music)

511
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,216
Ryan?

512
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:05,221
(pensive music)
       (door unlatching)

513
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:11,561
(bottles clinking)

514
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:12,262
Oh, Ryan.

515
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:14,297
Hey.

516
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,165
Sorry.

517
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,070
- [Ryan] You gonna lecture me
 about not comin' this morning?

518
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:24,641
- Hey, listen, I was thinkin',
 we should get outta here.

519
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:27,977
Just take a little vacation.

520
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,096
- What are you talkin' about?

521
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:32,214
- I just mean when was the last
time we just went somewhere?

522
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,150
- [Ryan] What about the shop?

523
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,585
- Well, Rey can take
      care of the shop

524
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:37,687
or we'll close it
      for a couple weeks.

525
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:38,288
- A couple weeks?

526
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,222
- Yeah.

527
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,623
Let's just go somewhere okay?

528
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,761
Let's forget about cars
    and school and work.

529
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:45,595
We can go anywhere.

530
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:46,329
You name the place.

531
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:51,968
- Ragwater Falls?

532
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:54,671
- Yeah, okay.

533
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,640
Yeah, you tell me where
    it is and we'll go.

534
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,142
- I don't know.

535
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,677
It was just some place
   Rey was talkin' about but,

536
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,011
maybe California or Colorado

537
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:05,181
but it's like rafting
     and fishing and stuff.

538
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:06,015
- That's sounds great.

539
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,183
Go pack your bag.

540
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:08,585
- Aren't we supposed
      to call first?

541
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,287
- Right.

542
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:14,924
Um, yeah we, we'll call
    your P.O. from the road.

543
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,092
- Mom.

544
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,627
- Please don't
      argue with me okay?

545
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:19,963
- I don't wanna get in trouble.

546
00:43:19,965 --> 00:43:20,930
Just call 'em.

547
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,100
- All right, I'll call.

548
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,906
I'll give 'em a call.

549
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:34,243
(gentle music)

550
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:48,224
- I'll be in the
      shop if you need me.

551
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:50,893
(gentle music)

552
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,334
- There's a customer here.

553
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:00,770
Says she wants to see you.

554
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,150
- Can I help you?

555
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:15,985
- My name's Dani Wilson.

556
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,819
I think you worked with
    my boyfriend Daryl Cobb?

557
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,223
(pensive music)

558
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,992
- Yeah, I'm sorry I think
   you got the wrong person.

559
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,160
- I ain't here to cause trouble.

560
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,828
- Like I said I
     don't know anything--

561
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,196
- But I will if I have to.

562
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,770
Look, I ain't no snitch.

563
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:36,773
I don't give a shit
      about stolen cars.

564
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,841
- I don't know what
     you're talkin' about.

565
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,443
- Daryl turned up
       dead yesterday.

566
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,112
I just need to know why.

567
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:45,381
- I'm really sorry to hear that.

568
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:48,718
(Dani sighs)

569
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,153
You talk to the police?

570
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:51,854
- The police don't give a shit.

571
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,289
He's just some junkie to them.

572
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,223
Did he ever talk about anybody

573
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,259
who could have been angry at him

574
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:59,328
or maybe somebody's car he'd
  stolen that had found him?

575
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,296
- Sorry.

576
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:06,202
Look, I don't want
     any trouble all right?

577
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,437
Cars are my ex's thing.

578
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,374
I wish I could help you, I
  just, I don't know anything

579
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,342
about what happened
      to your boyfriend.

580
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,245
- [Dani] Did he ever
      talk about anybody

581
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:20,349
that he might have
       worked with or...

582
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:21,718
- No, I'm sorry.

583
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:27,290
If anything comes to
    mind I'll let you know.

584
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,294
(ominous music)

585
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:41,037
(Leigh gasps)

586
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:47,243
- Well, thank you for your time.

587
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:54,951
Oh my God.

588
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,221
- It's not what you think.

589
00:45:58,223 --> 00:45:59,422
- Oh my God.

590
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,392
You get out of my way.

591
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,264
- I can't do that.

592
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,302
- [Ryan] Mom?

593
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,874
- Ryan, just get
      back to work buddy.

594
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,076
- Is everything okay?

595
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,010
- It's fine.

596
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,412
Just go on out back with Rey.

597
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:42,365
I swear to God, it
       was an accident.

598
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:45,301
He,

599
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,836
he attacked me.

600
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,918
(door slams)

601
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,406
- Leigh?

602
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,417
- I'm in trouble Rey.

603
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:39,422
(Leigh sniffling)

604
00:47:47,932 --> 00:47:50,433
- [Rey] Let's get outta here.

605
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:59,008
(engine rumbling)

606
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,342
- [Ryan] You comin'?

607
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,078
- Ryan, I...

608
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,184
If you um...

609
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:50,092
If you ever need your papers,

610
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:54,063
your birth certificate
     or anything,

611
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,599
there's a shoe box in my closet.

612
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,569
- Okay.

613
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,108
- Just--
          - [Rey] Hey.

614
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,376
[Rey] Foods gettin' cold.

615
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,246
(somber music)

616
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,384
- You hungry?

617
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:18,354
I'm starvin'.

618
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:22,124
(door slams)

619
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,359
- [Rey] All right, come on.

620
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,194
I need your answer.

621
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,597
- The wrist pin?

622
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,166
- Nope.

623
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:33,536
Wrist pin holds the piston
   to the connecting rod.

624
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:37,273
That's oh for three.

625
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,208
Guess who's got
      broom duty tomorrow?

626
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,977
- Mom's the one
       who made the mess.

627
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,478
- Excuse me?

628
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,314
- [Rey] I used to
     make stupid bets like

629
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,216
that with your dad all the time.

630
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:49,018
You remember that?

631
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,253
- Oh yeah.

632
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:54,323
I remember you used
     to lose all the time.

633
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,394
- Did you like him?

634
00:50:01,299 --> 00:50:02,198
My dad?

635
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:10,606
- Your dad was a,
       complicated guy.

636
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,308
He was really hard to know.

637
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:17,046
But hey, he made the
     world's greatest kid.

638
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:23,219
- Al right buddy, it's bed time.

639
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:24,320
- Come on.

640
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,289
- Say goodnight.

641
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,491
- Goodnight.

642
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,259
- [Rey] Goodnight.

643
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,416
How bad is it?

644
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,485
- You don't wanna know.

645
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,055
- Probably not but
      I don't see anybody

646
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,790
else lining up trying to help.

647
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:04,193
- I fucked up, Rey.

648
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,332
I didn't stop running cars
   after Jesse got put away.

649
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,851
- Jesus.

650
00:51:11,852 --> 00:51:13,369
- Hey, it was the only
    thing keepin' us afloat.

651
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:14,570
You know how things are.

652
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,239
I had to think about
      Ryan, about you.

653
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,474
- Don't put that on me.

654
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:20,843
- I didn't mean it like that.

655
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:25,414
- There wasn't a
      break in was there?

656
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,492
- I had a fight
       with Jesse's guy.

657
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,495
I swapped the VIN
      numbers on a truck.

658
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:41,664
He was supposed to
       bring me the money

659
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,432
but his buyer fell through.

660
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,868
So he said he wasn't gonna pay
 me till he found another one.

661
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:52,108
I told him that wasn't the
deal, I'd already done the work.

662
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:58,514
I lost my temper.

663
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,484
I threw a wrench.

664
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:05,354
We,

665
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:08,224
we had a fight.

666
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,261
It was an accident.

667
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,266
- What was an accident?

668
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:21,904
(Leigh gasping)

669
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:24,140
Oh, Jesus, Leigh.

670
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,544
Why didn't you call the cops?

671
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,446
- And tell 'em what?

672
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:32,481
Huh?

673
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:38,254
His girlfriend knows.

674
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:42,358
- [Rey] The woman from the shop?

675
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,700
- I keep thinking I hear sirens.

676
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:53,936
Is that weird?

677
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:58,908
- Does Ryan know?

678
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:03,679
- He deserves better, Rey.

679
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,684
A dad in jail, a mom on
   the way, a grandfather...

680
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,623
Might as well lock
       him up myself.

681
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,260
- He's a good kid.

682
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:21,263
He'll be okay.

683
00:53:24,969 --> 00:53:27,303
- What do they even do,

684
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,909
if a kid's got no parents?

685
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:37,246
- He's always welcome
    with me, you know that.

686
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:38,214
- I couldn't ask you that.

687
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,882
- And you're not gonna have to.

688
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,388
We're gonna get this
      thing figured out.

689
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,460
(gentle music)

690
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,030
(thunder rumbling)

691
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:37,306
(rain pattering)

692
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:42,778
(door shutting)

693
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,850
(pensive music)

694
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:57,026
(men whispering)

695
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,899
- [Richard] Your service weapon?

696
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,702
You shot the man with
     your service weapon?

697
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:10,690
- [Man] Shit.

698
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:11,607
- [Richard] Report it stolen.

699
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:13,809
Dump it somewhere.

700
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,944
- [Man] Won't that
       seem suspicious?

701
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:19,682
- [Richard] You think
     you got a better idea?

702
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:21,850
God damn it!

703
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,087
- [Man] What was
       I supposed to do?

704
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:28,657
- [Richard] Shake him
     down, not shoot him.

705
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,428
Help me move him.

706
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:43,772
(body thuds)

707
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:50,045
- [Man] You think
       your girl heard?

708
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,014
What if she says somethin'?

709
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:55,017
- [Richard] She's a good girl.

710
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:57,453
She'll do what she's told.

711
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:23,412
(door creaking)

712
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:27,950
(Travis yells)

713
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:32,654
(Travis groaning)
       (Leigh groaning)

714
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,179
- It was you that
       killed my daddy?

715
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:58,647
- Please!

716
00:56:58,649 --> 00:56:59,882
Please (groans)!

717
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,750
- You scream, I
       kill your son too.

718
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,421
- You don't have to do this.

719
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:07,656
(Leigh choking)

720
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:08,924
- Shut up!

721
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:13,562
(Leigh screaming)
       (Travis groaning)

722
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,800
(Leigh wheezing)

723
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:18,700
- Rey!

724
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,502
It's her son.

725
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,772
(Leigh gasping)

726
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,208
(gun loading)

727
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,443
Ryan, no.

728
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,076
- Whoa, whoa buddy.

729
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,178
It's okay.

730
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:31,180
Leigh.

731
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:33,916
- Buddy?

732
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,952
Hey, give it to me.

733
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:37,853
Ryan?

734
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:41,723
It's okay.

735
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:42,558
It's okay.

736
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,725
Hey, hey.

737
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:44,726
We're okay.

738
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:52,701
- Hey buddy, hey?

739
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,239
You got any duct
       tape around, huh?

740
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,242
- Yeah?

741
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,577
- Okay, can you
       go get it for me?

742
00:58:02,746 --> 00:58:03,579
- Yeah.

743
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,213
- [Rey] All right.

744
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:05,714
- [Leigh] Yeah.

745
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:14,623
- You gotta call the cops.

746
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:22,097
- I know.

747
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:41,216
(thunder rumbling)
      (crickets chirping)

748
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:43,252
You okay?

749
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:46,922
Hey buddy, come on.

750
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:47,956
Let's go inside.

751
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,759
It's startin' to rain.

752
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,571
Look, I'm really
     sorry about all this.

753
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:06,208
- He didn't get away did he?

754
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,581
The man at the garage?

755
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,919
It was me that
     killed him wasn't it?

756
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,720
- No, Ryan.

757
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,155
- Stop lyin' to me.

758
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,128
I felt it break in his head.

759
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,930
- That is not the
       way it happened.

760
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:28,964
- Yes it is.
          - No.

761
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,098
There was a fight.

762
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,300
That man attacked me.

763
00:59:31,302 --> 00:59:32,935
- No.
   - I hit him, he went down.

764
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,036
You weren't anywhere around.

765
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,104
- That's not the truth.

766
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:36,171
- I don't care
       what the truth is.

767
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:39,174
This is the truth now.

768
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,109
You understand?

769
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:45,781
Look.

770
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,685
I made some really
       shitty decisions.

771
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:53,088
That's why we're in the
 situation we're in right now.

772
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:55,891
- I killed that kid's dad.

773
00:59:58,028 --> 00:59:59,094
- He attacked me.

774
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:01,797
You didn't do anything wrong.

775
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,765
- Then why is it a secret?

776
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,670
- 'Cause it's just
       simpler that way.

777
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,976
- It's because of
     the trouble I got in.

778
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:19,314
You're scared I'm like dad.

779
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:22,084
- Ryan, you are nothin'
    like your father.

780
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,652
- Well then who am I like?

781
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:25,854
You?

782
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,894
(Ryan scoffs)

783
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,146
(Leigh sighs)

784
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,953
- [Rey] He's a lot
    stronger than you think.

785
01:00:57,955 --> 01:01:00,222
- [Travis] Fuck you, you
    stupid fuckin' bitch.

786
01:01:00,224 --> 01:01:01,023
(Travis groaning)

787
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:02,824
- Hey, hey, no, no!

788
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,759
- [Travis] Get off me!

789
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:04,326
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

790
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,861
No, no, no, no.

791
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,996
(Travis mumbling)

792
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,932
Look, it's not gonna help, okay?

793
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,875
We'll get a lawyer and we'll
  get this thing figured out.

794
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:21,710
- Yeah.

795
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:23,145
(Knocking)

796
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:24,046
- Okay.

797
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,315
Just don't tell 'em
     that the kid broke in.

798
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:28,216
That's it.

799
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:30,285
Okay?

800
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:31,119
(Knocking)

801
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:32,888
- [Richard] Leigh?

802
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:43,432
- You didn't call the cops?

803
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:45,267
- I just need some advice first.

804
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:48,837
- You know damn well the kind
 of advice he's gonna give you.

805
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:52,441
(gentle music)

806
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:55,010
- You should get outta here.

807
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,747
- [Richard] Leigh open up.

808
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,828
(door latches)

809
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,899
(Leigh sniffles)

810
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:26,374
You all right?

811
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:27,375
- I'm okay.

812
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:28,844
- Ryan?

813
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:29,478
- [Leigh] He's fine.

814
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,213
He's in his bedroom.

815
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,399
- You fucked up, kid.

816
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,108
How'd he find you?

817
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:04,513
- His mom must've told him.

818
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:06,014
- How'd she find you?

819
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:10,485
- [Leigh] I lost my necklace
  when I was droppin' him off.

820
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:11,887
She must've found it.

821
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:17,392
- You didn't think that
    was worth tellin' me?

822
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,895
- I didn't expect
      it to get this far.

823
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:22,297
- It has.

824
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,466
- What am I lookin' at?

825
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,069
If I turn myself in?

826
01:03:29,106 --> 01:03:30,205
- That depends.

827
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:34,409
You really stop runnin' cars
  after Jesse got sent up?

828
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,113
Right.

829
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,016
Felony murder.

830
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:42,150
- It was self defense.

831
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,385
- It doesn't matter.

832
01:03:43,387 --> 01:03:45,153
Stealin' cars--
        - Swapping tags.

833
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,421
- Is a felony.

834
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:48,857
And the piece of shit was killed

835
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:50,292
in the commission of the crime.

836
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:51,259
- All right, okay.

837
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,362
All right.

838
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:55,497
There's gotta be another way.

839
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,432
- I think you know there is.

840
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,134
- I can, I'll talk to her.

841
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,503
I can explain that...

842
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:06,107
God damn it.

843
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:07,209
- Look at me.

844
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:10,545
I checked down at
       the department.

845
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:12,347
They ain't got
       shit for evidence,

846
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,216
and they ain't lookin' for any,

847
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,885
but if you're tellin' me
  that this woman and her boy,

848
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,086
they know somethin' about
   you, they got proof--

849
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:19,621
- No, no, no.

850
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:21,456
No, I am not like you.

851
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,158
I don't have that in me.

852
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,595
- So you said your whole
   damn life but here we are.

853
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:33,435
Livin' with somethin' like
   this is a son of a bitch,

854
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:35,170
but it's livin'.

855
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:46,047
- I don't want the
       kid here anymore.

856
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,282
Take him to the shop.

857
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,151
- Okay.

858
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:52,053
Then what?

859
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:02,097
- I don't know (sniffles).

860
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,634
Don't, don't do anything
    until I get there.

861
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,135
- What about the girl?

862
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:11,039
(Leigh gasping)

863
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,107
- I'll figure somethin' out.

864
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:17,178
(Knocking)

865
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:31,026
I came to see if you
      could watch Ryan?

866
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,096
- You must think of me
    as a real asshole, huh?

867
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,431
- That is not--
        - Don't.

868
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:40,435
You want him to find
      a different way?

869
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:42,671
Show it to him.

870
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:44,306
- Why didn't you call the cops?

871
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,177
- Because I knew that
     you wouldn't hurt him.

872
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:52,147
- Maybe I already did.

873
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:57,552
- [Rey] Did you?

874
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,325
- Please Rey.

875
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:07,729
I'm not askin' for me.

876
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:25,613
Hey, did you um,

877
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:31,519
did you tell Ryan about some
  raftin' or fishin' place?

878
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,222
Colorado maybe?

879
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:36,524
- Yeah.

880
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:39,327
- I think it caught
      his imagination.

881
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,165
Might be nice to
       take him sometime.

882
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:49,237
(gentle music)

883
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:58,346
- What's gonna happen to him?

884
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:05,453
- Your grandfather's
    gonna take him to jail.

885
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:11,259
- What if I told
     them it was my fault?

886
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:13,495
Would he still have to go?

887
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:25,073
- Some things just
       can't be undone.

888
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,415
Hey?

889
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,415
You've got so much good in you.

890
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,619
- I'm sorry,

891
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,823
about what I said.

892
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,193
About not bein' like you.
   - No, no.

893
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,561
- I didn't--
          - Hey.

894
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:57,372
(Leigh sniffling)

895
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,207
All right.

896
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:01,309
I'll see ya in the morning.

897
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:20,462
(pensive music)

898
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:50,191
(fan whirring)

899
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:44,606
(Dani gasps)

900
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,674
You send him to kill me?

901
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:47,675
- What?

902
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:48,943
- Your boy?

903
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,945
You send him for revenge.

904
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:51,779
- Where is he?

905
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:52,747
Where's my son?

906
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,383
- He broke in and attacked me.

907
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:56,451
- Is he...

908
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:59,554
- He's fine, for now.

909
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,357
- Oh God.

910
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:03,891
- Are you sayin'
        you didn't know?

911
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,562
- It ain't like he
    didn't have good reason.

912
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,567
- Why haven't you
      called the cops yet?

913
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:17,572
- Did Cobb really attack you
  the night you killed him?

914
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:19,941
- Mm hm.

915
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,509
- Sounds like him.

916
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:26,848
You here to kill me now too?

917
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,854
You don't seem like the type.

918
01:11:32,856 --> 01:11:33,955
- That's enough.

919
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:38,293
- Tryin' to protect someone?

920
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:40,895
Is it the Mexican?

921
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:42,597
- I said that's enough.

922
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:43,431
- Fuck.

923
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:47,402
(pensive music)

924
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:51,739
Easy momma bear, we both got
  cubs we're worried about.

925
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:56,911
- Pack your bags.

926
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,347
- What?

927
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:00,548
- For both of you.

928
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:01,683
You got two minutes.

929
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:04,619
We're gonna go get your boy,
  you're gonna get in your car

930
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:05,586
and you're gonna get outta here.

931
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,739
- Where are we supposed to go?

932
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,891
- North, south, east,
   west, I don't give a shit!

933
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:15,330
But you are gonna stay the
 fuck away from me and my son.

934
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,598
(pensive music)

935
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,670
(tires on gravel)

936
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:29,711
Hey?

937
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:30,778
- Yeah?

938
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,947
- [Leigh] It's me,
       we're comin' in.

939
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,682
- Oh Jesus.

940
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,884
- All right, that's far enough.

941
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:40,455
Good girl.

942
01:12:40,457 --> 01:12:42,924
(pensive music)

943
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:46,894
What are you doin'?

944
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:48,096
- These two are gonna
     get in their car.

945
01:12:48,098 --> 01:12:49,530
They're leavin' town.

946
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,466
- Leigh.

947
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,735
You've lost your nerve.

948
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:54,635
- Don't touch me.

949
01:12:57,941 --> 01:13:00,541
- What do you think is
     gonna happen, Leigh?

950
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:01,776
You think they're
       gonna just walk

951
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,911
out of here and
       forget everything?

952
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:06,547
- That's exactly what
     they're gonna do.

953
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,882
- And what if they don't?

954
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:10,918
What happens when
     that bitch and her pup

955
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,687
are 20, 30 miles down the road

956
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:14,655
and you don't have
       that gun on 'em?

957
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,024
You're gonna be livin' with what

958
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:19,861
you do right now
        for a long time.

959
01:13:20,797 --> 01:13:21,963
- They don't deserve this.

960
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,700
- Nobody said they did.

961
01:13:34,043 --> 01:13:35,977
- I'm not killin'
       anyone tonight.

962
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,913
- Jesus Christ.

963
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:42,016
- No!

964
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,618
- No, don't!

965
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:44,652
- Get outta the way.

966
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:45,553
- No.

967
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,565
(shot firing)
      (object clattering)

968
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,700
(Travis groaning)

969
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,736
- Can't guard both of 'em girl.

970
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:02,570
Come on.

971
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:04,739
Let's finish it now.

972
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:05,973
(gun cocking)

973
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,942
- [Leigh] Put it down.

974
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:13,014
(shots firing)

975
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:19,487
- Everything that I've ever
  done was to protect you.

976
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:21,956
- Bullshit.

977
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,860
I've kept your
     secrets my whole life.

978
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:34,569
A kid should never be
     asked such a thing.

979
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:38,172
- Leigh!
         - No, Travis!

980
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:40,908
(shots firing)

981
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,076
- Leigh!
            - No!

982
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,212
No!

983
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:47,882
(Dani groaning)
       (Richard groaning)

984
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:51,018
(objects clattering)

985
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:58,025
(Dani screams)
         (tense music)

986
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,978
- No!

987
01:15:00,979 --> 01:15:03,930
(Dani gasping)
       (Richard groaning)

988
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,935
- [Dani] Travis, run!

989
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:17,178
(shot firing)
        (Leigh gasping)

990
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:22,250
(Dani gasping)

991
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,732
- You killed him.

992
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:42,136
- [Dani] That wasn't my plan.

993
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:47,041
Oh God.

994
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:49,310
Was he a cop?

995
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:57,635
- Yeah.

996
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,985
- [Dani] Oh shit, shit, shit.

997
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:06,694
- I didn't tell my
     dad to hurt your boy.

998
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:10,231
- I didn't send
      Travis to kill you.

999
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,736
- We gonna just kill
      each other anyway.

1000
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:21,576
- There's somethin'
      that I need to know.

1001
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,030
Why did you bring him to me?

1002
01:16:26,031 --> 01:16:28,148
Why didn't you just bury
   him in the fuckin' woods?

1003
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:32,320
- Does it matter?

1004
01:16:32,322 --> 01:16:37,592
(Dani sniffling)

1005
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:41,662
You needed to know.

1006
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:46,734
(Dani sobbing)

1007
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:07,154
It doesn't have
       to end like this.

1008
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:10,291
We can both walk away.

1009
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:12,393
- Then what?

1010
01:17:13,863 --> 01:17:15,162
- I don't know.

1011
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:17,131
I don't care.

1012
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,337
I just wanna go home.

1013
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:28,409
(Dani sobbing)

1014
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:39,020
(Leigh exhaling)

1015
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:51,999
I'm comin' out now.

1016
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,401
- Don't you fuckin' move.

1017
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,301
- Easy.

1018
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:01,942
I'm just gettin' your keys.

1019
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:09,116
(keys jingling)

1020
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:31,872
I'm puttin' my gun down now.

1021
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,389
- You're a good person, Leigh.

1022
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:53,194
(shot firing)

1023
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:58,265
(pensive music)
        (Leigh gasping)

1024
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:04,138
(Dani sobbing)

1025
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,309
(shot firing)

1026
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:13,380
(Leigh gasping)

1027
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:21,956
Your old man was right.

1028
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,257
It was never gonna end.

1029
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:28,329
(Leigh gasping)

1030
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,800
But your boy is safe,
     you have my word.

1031
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:37,905
I owe you that for lettin'
   me bury him proper.

1032
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:42,443
(Leigh gasping)

1033
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,946
(Leigh unintelligible)

1034
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:54,054
(Leigh unintelligible)

1035
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,490
(somber music)

1036
01:20:04,267 --> 01:20:07,067
You're gonna get
      blood on your shoes.

1037
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:09,937
(somber music)

1038
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:33,828
("Hold On")

1039
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:41,569
¶ Noah, Noah, let me come in ¶

1040
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:45,339
