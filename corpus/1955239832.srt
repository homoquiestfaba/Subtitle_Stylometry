1
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,062
What's one about?

2
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,396
It's a comedy ma'am.

3
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:06,698
It's a comedy?

4
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:10,168
Comedy, comedy

5
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:11,469
Is it funny?

6
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:12,503
I don't know ma'am.
I haven't seen it.

7
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,106
He hasn't seen it.

8
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:15,506
Hasn't seen it?

9
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:16,675
No, no.

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,710
I hope there's
no swearing in it.

11
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:19,977
I don't want swearing.

12
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,846
No, there's no swearing in it.

13
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,047
She hates swearing.

14
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,482
I'm not sure ma'am.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,017
I can ask the manager.

16
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:28,353
He's gonna go ask the manager.

17
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:31,088
Ask the manager? No swearing.

18
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:31,957
No swearing.

19
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:33,692
For fuck's sake.

20
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:53,811
We need
to talk, Barbara.

21
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,127
Hey guys, could you turn
off your phone please?

22
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:15,200
Are you, Barbara?

23
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,603
Who is this Mr. Stick?

24
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,080
Hey guys, could please
turn off the phone?

25
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:30,516
Thank you.

26
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,719
Come in.

27
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,195
Come on guys, come on.

28
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:46,998
I'm trying to watch
a movie, all right?

29
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,666
Please just turn it off.

30
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,635
Hey shut off your
own phone jackoff.

31
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:51,904
We paid to watch the movie too.

32
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,337
Yeah, well you're
not watching it.

33
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:55,908
Hey, who are you old
man the local movie cop?

34
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:57,509
Kiss my ass.

35
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:16,387
Mr. Lee, I can check the
replacement unit in the morning.

36
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,556
Check
it now Johnson.

37
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,223
No morning, too late.

38
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,659
It's almost five o'clock.

39
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,895
You said it
Johnson, almost five o'clock.

40
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:24,595
So get working.

41
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,065
Yes, sir. Okay.

42
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:30,468
Dammit, son of a

43
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:48,452
I told that bitch to get
her own set of paper clips.

44
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,092
My god it's not like I'm
being paid to babysit her.

45
00:04:55,661 --> 00:05:00,666
Yes, yes.

46
00:05:20,385 --> 00:05:25,089
Exactly, exactly.

47
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:27,759
That cow needs to get a life.

48
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,796
No, no one respects
her up there.

49
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,399
Even corporate is
losing patience

50
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:35,267
Ma'am.

51
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,867
I'm trying to tell you

52
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,069
I can't stand that lady
Excuse me ma'am.

53
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,303
They get on my nerves.

54
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:40,539
Excuse me.

55
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,805
I promise you

56
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:42,540
I think I'm having

57
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,710
Not at all.

58
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,005
<b>STRESSED TO KILL</b>

59
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,559
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

60
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,678
Well, you certainly
look a lot better

61
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,447
than you did the
last time I saw you.

62
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,550
How you feeling?

63
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,884
Lucky, apparently
you removed an elephant

64
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:09,653
that was sitting on my chest.

65
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,859
Interesting analogy,
I suppose I did.

66
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,462
Thanks for saving
my life, doc.

67
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:19,898
Well, you're
welcome, Mr. Johnson,

68
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,799
but you know you're
not out of danger yet.

69
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:25,703
I know, but you believe
me this was a wake up call.

70
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:29,139
Yes, it was, and you
can choose to blow it off

71
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,510
as a bump in the road
like a lot of guys do.

72
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,078
I promise ya it'd be a mistake.

73
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,181
What do you do for a living?

74
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,750
Inspecting and install
fire safety equipment.

75
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,452
Do you like your job?

76
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,587
Better than being stuck
in an office all day.

77
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:47,191
I hear that, but
is it stressful?

78
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:51,562
For the most part
no, outdoors on my own.

79
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,630
It's good work.

80
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,200
Well, do you have any hobbies?

81
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,300
What do you like to do?

82
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,236
I like to travel.

83
00:08:59,303 --> 00:09:00,472
We used to do that a lot.

84
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,541
My wife has other interests now.

85
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,043
I see

86
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:10,481
It's 156 over 118.

87
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:14,251
Is that bad?

88
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,821
Well, let's just say
if it gets any higher,

89
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,356
you could be
visiting the morgue.

90
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,059
What do the numbers mean?

91
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,762
Well the top number
is the pressure

92
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,598
in your arteries
when your beats.

93
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:28,133
The bottom number
is the pressure

94
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,934
between beats when
your heart's at rest.

95
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,903
If you want to see another
set of birthday candles,

96
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:35,373
you're gonna have to get
these numbers way down.

97
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:39,477
120 over 80 ideally, a
little higher's acceptable.

98
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:42,312
Tell me if you had to pinpoint

99
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:45,049
the persistent stresses
in your life right now,

100
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,184
what would you say?

101
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:52,556
I guess people.

102
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,693
Yeah people.

103
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,330
A lot of assholes
out there, doc.

104
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:02,534
Sometimes I can't take it.

105
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:05,603
I understand, Bill.

106
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,438
Hell I agree with ya.

107
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,640
But you gotta learn
to get along them

108
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,009
as hard as that may
seem, and you need

109
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,745
to identify and get the
more persistent ones

110
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,047
out of your life completely.

111
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:18,717
How do you suggest I do that?

112
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,019
It's not easy to say.

113
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,787
Be creative.

114
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,556
I'm sure you'll come
up with something.

115
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,258
I want you to take
your blood pressure

116
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,625
every day and record it.

117
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,727
That'll tell ya if
it's working or not.

118
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,231
All right, okay, I'm on it.

119
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:36,166
Thanks doc.

120
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,249
Bill, you do not
need that much butter.

121
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,785
I'm not one of your
fatass clients, Vera.

122
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,087
Give me my toast!

123
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,255
No, but you don't
need that much fat.

124
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:07,765
You know you're headed for
another heart attack, Bill,

125
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,500
if you don't change your ways.

126
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:27,918
Thank you.

127
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,058
I cannot believe that you
drink those shakes dude.

128
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:36,260
They're terrible.

129
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,529
I had the strawberry.

130
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,664
Tasted like an old sock, Billy.

131
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:42,534
Wouldn't even feed
that to my dog.

132
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,100
Can't even clean
the floor with it.

133
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,337
I don't know how
the hell you do it.

134
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:48,972
What do

135
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,775
you mean you want
to see other people?

136
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,744
Are you breaking up with me?

137
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,082
My God, this has never
happened to me before.

138
00:11:58,582 --> 00:11:59,384
Really?

139
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,919
Are you dumping me?

140
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:05,289
Yes, yes, he is dumping you.

141
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:08,959
Plastic bitch, hopefully
into a landfill.

142
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:14,030
Jesus,
Billy.

143
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:17,901
Brother, that was
straight cold, seriously.

144
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:19,871
It's been two weeks now right?

145
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,505
How you feeling man?

146
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,175
I think I'm ready
to go back to work.

147
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,779
Work?

148
00:12:29,347 --> 00:12:32,250
Vera, she still busting
your balls, is that it?

149
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:35,085
It's her hobby.

150
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,621
You're supposed to be
home relaxing man, you know.

151
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:40,290
Chill out, smell the roses.

152
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,994
You got to take
care of that ticker

153
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,897
of yours, that's
what's important.

154
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:48,666
Somebody better
tell Vera that.

155
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:51,970
Hey!

156
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,371
What the hell!

157
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,539
You ever hear of 'excuse me'?

158
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,207
Hey!

159
00:12:58,143 --> 00:12:59,476
Hell no.

160
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,013
Son of a bitch.

161
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:04,882
Hell, Billy
don't, stop Billy!

162
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,154
Billy! Don't do it man!

163
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:14,625
Hey!

164
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,062
Let it go, Billy!

165
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,931
Jesus Christ.

166
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,964
Jesus, Bill?

167
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,601
What happened to the show?

168
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,336
What show?

169
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,171
I only asked you
to do one thing,

170
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:03,341
my Celebrity Dance Off.

171
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:04,808
Why didn't you record it?

172
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,479
Why don't you just watch
the show when it's on?

173
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,813
Honey, I'm sorry, I hate,

174
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,482
I can't stand that thing.

175
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,418
You say that, Bill,
but when you got

176
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,821
nothing else to do all day long

177
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,922
but hang out with your
lazy-assed friend,

178
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,558
it's a little disappointing.

179
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,895
Disappointing?

180
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,464
I'm just saying.

181
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,801
Honey, I did not hang
out with Stan all day,

182
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:32,336
we just had lunch, all right.

183
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,571
I just had other things to do.

184
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:34,805
Like what?

185
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:36,707
Like getting the oil changed.

186
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:38,610
Getting stuff for work.

187
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,678
For work?

188
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,247
You're not going back to
work already, are you?

189
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,519
But what about
your yard project?

190
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:49,486
You mean, your yard project.

191
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:53,990
Bill, your doctor told
you to take it easy.

192
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,726
It's only been two weeks.

193
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,595
My blood pressure is down.

194
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,765
Yeah, that's hard to believe.

195
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,835
Billy, the doctor
told you he wants you

196
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:07,138
to avoid a stressful
environment.

197
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,007
That's why I'm going
back to work, sweetheart.

198
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:13,878
I'm just saying.

199
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:35,499
Crap!

200
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:05,329
Sweetie, no one's gonna

201
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,797
throw you out on the street.

202
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,467
And no one's gonna sell
all your things, okay?

203
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:13,003
Well, they got to send
you a letter first.

204
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,073
They better not.

205
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,074
I have nowhere else to go.

206
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,243
Well, what
else is wrong, honey?

207
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:21,379
I have
other bills, you know.

208
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,213
What about my Botox?

209
00:16:24,281 --> 00:16:26,482
All I hear is words,
words don't mean crap,

210
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:29,920
Stanley, or pay
my bills, so talk.

211
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,656
Honey, I ain't got
nothing else I can give you.

212
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:35,326
I mean I don't and
if I did, I would.

213
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,294
And I told your lawyer that.

214
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:39,962
And he told me that
you're a filthy no-good liar.

215
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:42,266
He said chemist's
makes serious money.

216
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,736
Chemists with
three ex-wives don't, okay?

217
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:49,674
God, listen honey, I, I
need to go, all right?

218
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,408
Listen, I'll call you back later

219
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,909
and we'll work
something out, okay?

220
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,212
Don't
you hang up Stanley.

221
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:57,649
God! Jesus!

222
00:16:58,316 --> 00:16:59,450
I love you, baby.

223
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,551
She's suing you
for the third time,

224
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:02,654
and you're giving her that shit?

225
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:05,122
It's my way of keeping her

226
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,757
psychologically medicated, Bill.

227
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,759
I mean, it's where I
need her to be right now.

228
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,393
Where you need her to be is

229
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:12,596
in a coffin six feet
under the ground.

230
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,699
That's a bit harsh.

231
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:16,133
So what's up?

232
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,305
I need a loan for a lawyer.

233
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,509
How much this time?

234
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,183
You already owe me a grand.

235
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:34,751
I do?

236
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:39,090
Well, tax time, that's
right around the corner.

237
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,457
We can work it out.

238
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,262
Okay, but after
this time that's it.

239
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,632
Yeah,
thanks buddy, yeah.

240
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,198
You know you'd be better off

241
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,367
using my three grand
to hire a hitman.

242
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,704
Now where might I
find one of those?

243
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:54,072
Hell, I don't know, internet?

244
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,407
Why don't you look for
three for one special?

245
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:57,909
Three ex-wives for
the price of one.

246
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:01,079
Interesting that you bring
up the subject of poisons.

247
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,213
They have a fascinating
history, you know.

248
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:10,287
What would you say is
the fastest acting poison?

249
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:12,790
How fast?

250
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,894
Kills you
instantly? Right away!

251
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,865
Well, I don't know too many
that have worked that fast,

252
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,631
but you know there are several

253
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:24,434
that bring almost
instant paralysis.

254
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:28,639
You know, you're dead like
thirty seconds later.

255
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,009
That's good enough for me.

256
00:18:34,544 --> 00:18:36,546
Why are you so suddenly
interested in poisons?

257
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:38,149
I'm just a curious cat.

258
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:41,685
Curiosity killed
the cat, my friend.

259
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,088
Cat should have been
more damned careful.

260
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,159
Okay, I got a raccoon
tearing up the yard.

261
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,227
I got to do something.

262
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:51,996
Little bastards!

263
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:09,380
Excuse, girl, Veronica
can kiss my hairy rearend.

264
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,782
She is not the boss of me.

265
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,851
It's hard to believe she's
still got a damn job.

266
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,588
She got to be blowing
somebody in Contracts.

267
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,591
Sweet Jesus!

268
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,257
You were coming
to bed an hour ago.

269
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,427
What are you doing in
here on a Friday night?

270
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,196
You know I still
remember a time

271
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:35,198
when people knocked,
even on Fridays.

272
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,503
Sorry, did I interrupt
you jerking off or something?

273
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,670
No, I did that earlier.

274
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,272
Now I'm planning our future.

275
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,042
I can only imagine.

276
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:46,743
Well, you're going to
need more than a plan

277
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,713
if you ever plan to
be someone, Bill.

278
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,481
I am someone, sweetheart.

279
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:53,450
I'm Bill Johnson.

280
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,486
I'm perfectly happy
with that, okay?

281
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,955
Life isn't just a
dress rehearsal, Bill.

282
00:20:58,288 --> 00:20:59,823
You really need to step it up.

283
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,165
I got a few
surprises up my sleeve.

284
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:11,501
I believe that this is

285
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:13,004
what you were inquiring about.

286
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,642
A little Hollywood,
don't you think?

287
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,811
Hell no, I don't want
you to be mistaking it

288
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:24,448
for, you know, cough syrup.

289
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:25,882
How much punch does it have?

290
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:30,755
Let's put it this way.
They ain't getting up.

291
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,158
Who's they?

292
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:36,294
I don't know.

293
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,596
I should be asking
you that, mystery man.

294
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,967
Raccoons? Yeah.

295
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,573
Hey, that work
colleague you mentioned

296
00:21:48,939 --> 00:21:50,274
is he fat and bald?

297
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,946
Are you talking about
Flip, Flip Feinstein?

298
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:57,614
Hell yeah, he's uglier than
both of us combined, Billy.

299
00:21:57,848 --> 00:21:59,250
His name is Flip?

300
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,687
Yeah, but everyone seems
to call him, Big Boy.

301
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:06,657
He seems to fancy himself
quite the lady's man.

302
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:07,658
You're kidding me?

303
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:09,594
Yes, I'm kidding.

304
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,129
Well, you seen the guy, right?

305
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:13,864
Hell, I'm thinking
the last woman

306
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,400
that actually touched his
wiener was his mother.

307
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:20,438
Yeah, she was changing
his diaper. Yeah.

308
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:08,451
Yep, I should be home
around seven o'clock.

309
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:11,822
What the hell?

310
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,625
No problem.

311
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,395
Come on buddy, get your stinking
tank out of my driveway.

312
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:22,400
Mother fucking
bastard, ridiculous.

313
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:28,572
Hey zip cat, were your
ears painted on or what?

314
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:30,341
Are you having
a bad day, buddy?

315
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:32,075
You're in my driveway.

316
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,843
I got to go to work.

317
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:37,448
Okay, I gotta go.

318
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,753
So that's how it is?

319
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:03,373
Jesus, this guy's on the tank.

320
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:11,916
Son of a bitch, this
guy's gonna kill somebody.

321
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:19,724
Son of a bitch.

322
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:32,702
What's your problem, faggot?

323
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:33,602
You want a date or something?

324
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:34,572
Hold on man.

325
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:37,307
You are my problem, asshole.

326
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,809
You don't quit driving like
that you're gonna kill somebody.

327
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:42,679
I can't hear you
man. I can't hear you.

328
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,485
Shit.

329
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,719
Are you crazy?

330
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,747
Nice job, Mr. Johnson,
I'm very impressed.

331
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:19,917
Whatever it is you're
doing seems to be working.

332
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:21,752
Care to share your secret?

333
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:25,456
Not yet, it's still
in the testing stage.

334
00:25:26,055 --> 00:25:28,825
I see, well other than that,
how's everything else been?

335
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,528
You staying out of trouble?

336
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:33,264
For the most part yeah,
I did go back to work.

337
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:37,101
I don't know, it
may be a bit soon.

338
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:39,035
You still need to take it easy.

339
00:25:40,603 --> 00:25:42,105
I can't relax at home, doc.

340
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:43,841
Does your wife work?

341
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,642
From home.

342
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:50,914
I see, all right, but
just don't overdo it, okay?

343
00:25:50,915 --> 00:25:51,949
Yes, sir.

344
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,384
Now listen to me.

345
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,884
You're not recovering
from a cold.

346
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,152
The heart means business.

347
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:58,255
Thanks, doc, I understand.

348
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:03,660
Brent! Brent!

349
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,563
Sir, over here.

350
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:11,835
Don't tell me we got
transferred now back to traffic?

351
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:15,706
No sir, no, no, this
isn't a traffic case.

352
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,842
In fact, I think this
man was murdered.

353
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,480
You want to enlighten me?

354
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,481
Come take a look.

355
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:30,387
What am I looking at?

356
00:26:30,787 --> 00:26:31,554
Here.

357
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:38,962
You see that dart?

358
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:42,765
Yeah, I got eyes, I can see.

359
00:26:44,802 --> 00:26:45,969
That didn't kill him.

360
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:51,241
No, sir, but I believe
that this one did.

361
00:26:54,011 --> 00:26:55,379
It was removed from
the victim's neck.

362
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,581
I'm guessing poison.

363
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:21,304
Dear God, not again.

364
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:35,052
No refuge from these
inconsiderate bastards.

365
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:36,654
Lionel, you know

366
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,292
no, nothing personal to it,

367
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:43,260
I despise all men,

368
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,396
actually I despise...

369
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:47,130
all women too.

370
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:49,832
Come to think of it,

371
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,768
I despise everyone.

372
00:27:57,775 --> 00:28:01,078
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

373
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:05,716
Could you keep it down please,
it's kind of a small theater.

374
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,117
Could you turn off
your phone, too?

375
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:09,553
Thank you.

376
00:28:16,794 --> 00:28:19,529
Screw him, the guy
thinks he owns the place.

377
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,497
I know.

378
00:28:20,563 --> 00:28:21,732
Jesus.

379
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,766
Hold the
phone up a little higher

380
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,236
so they can see it on the TV.

381
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,042
Let's go
this Indian place.

382
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,510
I hate Indian food.

383
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:35,913
No, it's
good for your skin.

384
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,395
Excuse me, I just asked you

385
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,598
politely to please keep it down.

386
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,366
Who the hell are you?

387
00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:59,135
Shut your pie hole!
My turn to talk.

388
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,571
I paid fourteen
bucks for a movie,

389
00:29:01,572 --> 00:29:04,207
I don't pay to listen
to your mundane bullshit

390
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,476
or to watch you wave your
stupid phones around.

391
00:29:07,877 --> 00:29:09,279
Don't you shush me!

392
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,015
I'm doing this for you, too.

393
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,315
Hell, I'm doing
this for all of you.

394
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,518
Not one of you sons-a-bitches
have the balls to complain.

395
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:18,687
Turn the phone off and keep

396
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:20,189
your mouth shut until
the movie is over.

397
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:21,692
Thank you.

398
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,360
Fuck you.

399
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:28,819
Please!
Give it to me.

400
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,620
Yeah, baby!

401
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,419
Come on!

402
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,956
Baby.

403
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:36,627
Fuck,
Flip, give it to me.

404
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:41,998
Come on,
turn around baby.

405
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:52,743
Yeah, hell yes,
baby, hell yes.

406
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,496
Ashley? Hey.

407
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,997
What are you doing
here? What a surprise!

408
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:16,999
Come here.

409
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:20,268
What are you trying to do?

410
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:21,537
Give your old man
another heart attack?

411
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,139
I'm sorry, Daddy.

412
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,707
I did call the house,
but there was no answer.

413
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:26,476
That's all right, I'll
forgive you this time.

414
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,313
It's good to see
you. You look great.

415
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:31,480
You're looking good yourself.

416
00:32:32,615 --> 00:32:34,250
Much better than how
Mom described you.

417
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:36,285
What were you expecting?

418
00:32:36,986 --> 00:32:39,288
I, I don't know, I thought
you'd be in bed at least.

419
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,858
Really?

420
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:46,762
My God,
look who's here.

421
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,065
Hey

422
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:50,132
When did you drop in?

423
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,601
An hour ago?

424
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:53,636
You staying for dinner?

425
00:32:54,103 --> 00:32:55,504
I'd love to, but
we're heading back

426
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,174
to Atlanta for dinner
date at Dave's parents.

427
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:59,842
How are his parents doing?

428
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:03,513
They're fine, still on
that exercise kick, Mom?

429
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:07,016
It's not a kick, Ashley,
it's a way of life.

430
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:10,286
That's just great.

431
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:12,890
Dad's looking pretty good?

432
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,026
Well, I don't know
what you call good,

433
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:17,593
I mean, he's still
not out of the woods.

434
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,163
What woods would
those be dear?

435
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,568
This is V.

436
00:33:29,438 --> 00:33:33,176
Daddy, Mom never stops
just pounding away, does she?

437
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:38,348
Yeah, yeah, your Mom's
a regular jackhammer.

438
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,487
What's going on, Sweetie?

439
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,689
I don't know to tell you this,

440
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,560
but I really am surprised
to see you looking so good.

441
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,462
I mean, it's great,
don't get me wrong,

442
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:56,364
It's just that when
Mom said there was

443
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:58,734
all kind of complications,
after the heart attack,

444
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,703
and that's why you
guys needed the money,

445
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:04,441
I, I expected you to look
like crap and you don't.

446
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:07,678
What money?

447
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:09,211
For the operation?

448
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,048
After your insurance
got cancelled?

449
00:34:12,215 --> 00:34:13,216
What operation?

450
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:16,019
Your bypass?

451
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:20,956
The bypass,
yeah, how much money

452
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:22,459
was that again, Sweetie?

453
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:24,327
$150,000.

454
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,133
Your mother asked
David for a $150,000?

455
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,535
Well, she asked David if
he would ask his parents.

456
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,037
They were cool. They
were happy to help.

457
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,174
When was this?

458
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:39,409
Couple days ago.

459
00:34:39,474 --> 00:34:41,577
Mom's going to be mad as hell
at me for telling you this.

460
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,947
She made me promise
not to say anything.

461
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,914
Not a word.

462
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:46,650
Scout's honor?

463
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,318
Scout's honor.

464
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:56,325
Daddy, next operation,
it, it's serious, right?

465
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:57,894
It's serious.

466
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:00,896
Well, don't die
me, Daddy, okay?

467
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:02,733
I'd hate to be left
alone with Mom.

468
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,236
I'm not going anywhere,
not for a while.

469
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:07,737
You better not.

470
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:09,271
You know how much I love you.

471
00:35:10,874 --> 00:35:11,875
I love you more.

472
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:13,809
That's debatable.

473
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:15,877
And
embedded in the necks

474
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:17,580
of both victims were
needlelike darts.

475
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:19,216
The police suspect the
needles contained a poison,

476
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,717
which killed the victims
soon after impact.

477
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:23,686
Here they come.

478
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,020
Okay, back
up, give us some space,

479
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:26,389
give us some space, please.

480
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,257
Detective?

481
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:29,026
Give us a minute, please.
Put that camera down.

482
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:29,926
Detective!

483
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,127
Give us a second, please.

484
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,261
Detective, please,
early reports suggested

485
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:33,997
there was a witness
in the theatre.

486
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,998
We have
several witnesses, yeah.

487
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:39,534
According to the wife
of the victim, here,

488
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:41,537
the husband, he had some
sort of scuffle here

489
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,774
with some man prior
to the incident.

490
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,075
I don't think that
individual is involved.

491
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,277
If he could indulge me and
come down to the department,

492
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:51,680
have a coffee with
me, I can clear him.

493
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:53,849
And I'll just be the
old fly on the wall.

494
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:55,419
Enough of the questions,
enough of the questions,

495
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,087
put the cameras
down, please, man.

496
00:35:58,153 --> 00:35:59,587
Give that girl

497
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,656
on her knees and pray to
God she wears those shoes.

498
00:36:01,657 --> 00:36:03,225
Mr. Gates, the last
victim of the individual

499
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,226
some have called "The Dart Man"

500
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:07,263
died while watching the
critically acclaimed

501
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:09,666
Oscar nominated, "Six
Bullets for Barbara."

502
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:10,766
Holy Shit,

503
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:11,568
He
Was 73 years old

504
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,202
and leaves behind a wife

505
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,136
He did it.

506
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,204
And three dogs.

507
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:16,039
That son of a bitch did it!

508
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:20,444
What?

509
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:21,744
Johnson, that you?

510
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:23,079
Who else would it be?

511
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,714
Yes, Mr. Lee, yes, it's me.

512
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:26,348
Welcome back
to the rat race, Johnson.

513
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:30,086
I'm sorry, but
plans changed this morning.

514
00:36:30,352 --> 00:36:32,255
I need you back at Bells,
pop off right here.

515
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:35,290
No, Mr. Lee, I'm five
minutes from the barracks,

516
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,193
it'll take me ninety
minutes to get back to Bell.

517
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:38,793
It can wait
till the afternoon.

518
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:41,298
Bell building more
important, more money.

519
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,964
Mr. Lee, I'm not
working this afternoon.

520
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,300
What?

521
00:36:44,633 --> 00:36:46,035
Why you not tell me that?

522
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:48,638
You know I'm on half days
for the next two weeks.

523
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:50,173
I had a heart attack, remember?

524
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:53,142
Half day no good
today, I already short staffed.

525
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,845
I need you help me out.

526
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:58,180
Okay, what the hell,
all right, I'll do it.

527
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:01,083
I said I'll do it, I'll
do it this afternoon.

528
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,120
Why are you
still on phone, Johnson?

529
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,621
Get cracking!

530
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:15,131
Yeah, so that's what I
was trying to tell you.

531
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:18,735
What?

532
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:22,271
Well, if they expect me to
do that, they can pay me.

533
00:37:22,706 --> 00:37:24,341
Do I look like a charity?

534
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,510
No, you look like an
island with an elephant legs.

535
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:31,180
What, what kind of
validation I need Jemma?

536
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:35,017
I know, I'm beautiful.

537
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:39,289
Well, he's a wimp, I
wouldn't date his ass either.

538
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:41,991
Have you seen the
kind of car he drives?

539
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:45,127
A ugly truck with
a tray in the back.

540
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:48,198
Get real, McNeil!

541
00:37:48,798 --> 00:37:52,169
Well, I done heard every
excuse in the lexicon, darling.

542
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,703
My ex-wife's gouging
me, I'm still trying

543
00:37:54,704 --> 00:37:58,374
to pay my college loans,
I prefer to eat at home.

544
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:01,811
The cracker

545
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,313
My parents lost their
savings on Wall Street,

546
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:06,917
and I'm still trying to
help them out, yeah, right.

547
00:38:09,218 --> 00:38:11,554
Kick him to the curb baby.

548
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,557
He is not going to put
a ring on your finger.

549
00:38:14,256 --> 00:38:16,626
Well, at least not
the one you deserve.

550
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:19,461
He don't deserve you, you need
to get with someone who does.

551
00:38:20,063 --> 00:38:21,798
You should try a dating site.

552
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:24,501
Yeah, a Jewish dating site.

553
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:27,670
Who gives a shit that
you're not Jewish,

554
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:29,639
by the time he finds
out, it'll be too late.

555
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:33,977
Dear.

556
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,117
Gosh, excuse
me, it's my floor.

557
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:48,992
Is she all right?

558
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:55,498
Hello!

559
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:57,800
Is that you William?

560
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,134
No, this is Santa Claus.

561
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:00,770
William's out back
feeding an elf.

562
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,670
Well Santa in case you happen

563
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:04,706
to be driving that
sleigh of yours,

564
00:39:04,707 --> 00:39:07,610
I suggest you stop by my
place on your way home?

565
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,145
There's something that
Billy and I need to discuss.

566
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:11,414
Why? What the
hell's so important?

567
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:13,816
Don't you watch the news?

568
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:15,952
Okay.

569
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,155
All right, I'm here,
what's going on?

570
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,523
Jesus, get in here.

571
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,092
You're all over the news.

572
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:24,627
That douchebag at the movies,

573
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,929
some guy in a car, Jesus, Billy.

574
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,098
What are you doing man?

575
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,633
You're running around
killing people.

576
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,368
Some detective thinks
that the same person

577
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:35,939
might responsible for
both murders.

578
00:39:36,439 --> 00:39:37,774
Brilliant?

579
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:39,909
My doctor said to
eliminate stress from life.

580
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,678
Yeah, and you
took his advice.

581
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:44,214
Clearly, it's working.

582
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,549
I had a rough couple of days.

583
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:47,483
Yeah?

584
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:49,352
Tell me about it.

585
00:39:50,552 --> 00:39:54,857
All right, so Vera's
exercise program

586
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,760
now includes
screwing her clients.

587
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,595
And the client she's
screwing is your buddy.

588
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:01,630
Big Boy?

589
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:04,233
And screwing in the park

590
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,002
is the exercise
program she has him on.

591
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:08,804
You, you actually saw 'em?

592
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,406
Yeah, I saw him, and let
me tell you something buddy,

593
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,007
she wasn't changing
his diaper either.

594
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:14,577
Jesus, Billy,
hell no, hell no.

595
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,277
And on top of that
I just found out

596
00:40:16,278 --> 00:40:18,013
that Vera conned David's family

597
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:19,416
out of a whole bunch of money.

598
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:20,915
And she's probably
going to use it

599
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,285
to hire a lawyer to take
me for everything I have.

600
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,489
Maybe run off with Big
Boy, who the hell knows.

601
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:28,624
Is that all?

602
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,128
No, no, actually it's not.

603
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:37,434
I also killed a fat hog
in an elevator today,

604
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:39,568
and it didn't do shit
for my blood pressure.

605
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:44,173
So after three murders, my
solution is no longer working.

606
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,277
What's going on with you?

607
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,677
You gotta be better than me?

608
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:50,279
And you're gonna, you're
gonna want to shoot me

609
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,481
with one of them
damned darts of yours,

610
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:54,249
when you hear what
I got to tell you.

611
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,854
Sweet Jesus, all
right, okay, hit me.

612
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:04,627
God, I gave
Thelma the three grand.

613
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:06,963
You are a lunatic.

614
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:09,298
And, of course, she lost
it all, gambled it all.

615
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,135
I mean, she is pissier
than ever, Billy.

616
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,803
She is definitely suing me.

617
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:17,140
Congratulations Stanley,
you are officially

618
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,842
a bigger fucking idiot
than I thought you were.

619
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,111
The money was for your lawyer.

620
00:41:21,177 --> 00:41:23,145
I know, I know,
and I wholly intended

621
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,613
to give it to him, I did.

622
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,114
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but after
you banged her all night,

623
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:28,217
your brain turned to mush
and you thought 41 years

624
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,420
of insanity would be
cured with three grand?

625
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,855
Well, she was
starting to sound

626
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,557
real reasonable,
Billy, I mean, really.

627
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:35,891
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, about the time

628
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,360
she was having a
screaming orgasm?

629
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,363
Yeah, yeah, you know, it
was right about that time.

630
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,737
I'm sorry, Billy, I didn't...

631
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:51,775
Shut up, shut up or
I'll murder you, too.

632
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:01,551
All right, I got to kill her.

633
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:04,454
That's what has to happen.

634
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:07,523
You owe me.

635
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:11,628
You owe me Thelma's murder.

636
00:42:15,731 --> 00:42:18,567
No, you can't be serious?

637
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,135
Yes, I'm serious.

638
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:23,439
If this friendship's gonna
survive, she has to go.

639
00:42:27,142 --> 00:42:29,111
She started murdering
you the day she met you.

640
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:35,684
No, it can't be a dart
or the same poison for her.

641
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,589
That'll lead the
cops straight to you.

642
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,664
You're not thinking about
shooting her, are you?

643
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:52,434
That's what the
bitch deserves.

644
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:55,771
No, that'll be dumb.

645
00:42:57,773 --> 00:43:01,143
Besides, I want to be
close when I do it.

646
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,014
I want to see the
life force leave.

647
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,865
All right, all right.

648
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:29,972
Maybe cyanide in
spray form, yeah.

649
00:43:32,175 --> 00:43:36,178
Two, maybe three
blasts in her mouth,

650
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:41,784
almost instant paralysis,

651
00:43:46,021 --> 00:43:47,456
it'll look like a heart attack.

652
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,791
Is it detectable?

653
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:52,428
Nope.

654
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:54,264
You positive?

655
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,867
Yeah.

656
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:02,204
We gotta find a
way to get to her.

657
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,007
Doesn't she still
live with her mother?

658
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,443
Hell, she even work?

659
00:44:09,345 --> 00:44:10,947
Why would she want to do that?

660
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,782
She's got me working for her.

661
00:44:16,218 --> 00:44:17,386
The only time she ever leaves

662
00:44:17,387 --> 00:44:19,122
the house is to
go see her lawyer.

663
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,758
And I'm paying for that, too.

664
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:24,961
Not for long.

665
00:44:28,363 --> 00:44:32,101
Hey, she still in that
twelve step program?

666
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:46,548
What are you doing today?

667
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:48,952
Taking care of a problem.

668
00:44:49,718 --> 00:44:50,986
You forgot your phone.

669
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:52,689
No, I didn't.

670
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,903
Wait, wait, wait.

671
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:10,139
Damn.

672
00:45:10,204 --> 00:45:11,373
No, no, no, that stays here.

673
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:13,175
What?

674
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:14,142
The cell phone, it's
a tracking device.

675
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:15,945
Gets pinged by cell towers.

676
00:45:16,278 --> 00:45:17,947
That's how cops place
you at a crime scene.

677
00:45:18,514 --> 00:45:19,716
Seriously?

678
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:22,552
Seriously, It's
called triangulation.

679
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:24,819
Anybody that brings a
cell phone with them to do

680
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,389
a crime is just
asking to get caught.

681
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:30,360
What do I do now?

682
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:32,160
Leave it here and turn it on.

683
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:33,562
That way if you're
ever suspected,

684
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:34,930
it looks like you
were home all day.

685
00:45:40,168 --> 00:45:41,303
That's neat.

686
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:42,738
All right, let's
rock and roll.

687
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,408
Yeah, shit.

688
00:46:05,128 --> 00:46:07,729
Jesus, there she is, Bill.

689
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:10,465
She's right on time.

690
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:12,668
At least she has one
positive attribute.

691
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:19,976
Okay, remember all right,
two blasts and then she's down.

692
00:46:21,343 --> 00:46:22,512
You sure about that?

693
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:25,081
You wanna test it?

694
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:27,984
No, no, just fine,
take your word for it.

695
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:32,755
You know if she doesn't go to
the bathroom, we're screwed.

696
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:37,325
She'll use it, her
bladder is like a sieve.

697
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:41,864
Good luck.

698
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:43,365
Thanks.

699
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:44,900
Last time I went
to an AA meeting,

700
00:46:44,901 --> 00:46:46,803
I wasn't planning on
killing anybody but myself.

701
00:46:46,968 --> 00:46:51,974
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,906
Help, my goodness.

703
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:34,709
I'm sorry, someone
help me, please.

704
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:35,811
My God!

705
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:37,212
Miss, could you help me?

706
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:41,082
I have taken a tumble,
I'm so sorry, dear.

707
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:42,685
I'm so embarrassed.

708
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,153
Are you all right?

709
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:46,255
I'm so sorry, I can't just

710
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:48,256
Thank you.

711
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:49,959
Do you need medication?

712
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:50,860
Thank you, my...

713
00:48:56,432 --> 00:48:57,633
Bill?

714
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:04,807
I never liked you,
Thelma, you're mean.

715
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:43,813
She didn't suffer, did she?

716
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,986
It was just like you said.

717
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,055
Couple of blasts
and she was gone.

718
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,504
Thank you.

719
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,207
That's what friends are for.

720
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:37,126
Who invited Big Boy?

721
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:41,097
He invited himself.

722
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:44,000
He's the one who
introduced me to Thelma.

723
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:47,903
Why does that not surprise me?

724
00:51:52,508 --> 00:51:53,876
How ya feeling?

725
00:51:56,678 --> 00:52:01,650
Like Houdini after a
spectacular escape.

726
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:27,909
Sautéed onions and
peppers, that sounds good.

727
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,414
Good afternoon, Mr. Kelly.

728
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:34,316
You don't mind if
I sit down, do you?

729
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,153
Well actually I wanted
to spend some time alone.

730
00:52:37,218 --> 00:52:38,387
Thank you, I appreciate it.

731
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:39,822
Sure

732
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:42,556
Detective Jordan, I don't want

733
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:44,860
to be here, to
tell you the truth.

734
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:47,595
It's your day of grieving.

735
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:50,499
I just got a few questions,
the old routine stuff.

736
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,034
What kind of questions?

737
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:53,903
This concerns the
death of your ex-wife.

738
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:57,405
By the way that was a
very lovely funeral.

739
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,408
Well thank you very much.

740
00:53:02,544 --> 00:53:07,550
I didn't know you were there,
did someone invite you?

741
00:53:08,517 --> 00:53:10,019
No, no, I invited myself.

742
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:13,987
Part of the job, sometimes
we attend the funeral

743
00:53:13,988 --> 00:53:16,391
of a murder victim
just to take a look.

744
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:19,527
See who shows up, it's
not uncommon sometimes

745
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:23,466
even for the killer to attend.

746
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:31,372
Did you, did you say
murder victim, Detective?

747
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:39,747
My Thelma, she, well she
died of a heart attack.

748
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:43,319
Yeah, we thought that
at first, but the coroner

749
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,323
he found traces of
cyanide in her lungs.

750
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,757
Now how crazy is that?

751
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:52,461
Your ex-wife being
murdered like that.

752
00:54:09,077 --> 00:54:11,579
Murdered? Cyanide?

753
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:16,619
Are you absolutely certain
of that, Detective?

754
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:17,719
Yeah, I'm quite sure.

755
00:54:31,332 --> 00:54:32,535
You okay?

756
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:38,306
Who on earth would
want to kill my Thelma?

757
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:42,042
Mr. Kelly, I'm sitting
here kind of hoping

758
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:45,046
you'd help me figure that out?

759
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,914
All right, look,
I'm not a cop, man.

760
00:57:32,046 --> 00:57:33,247
I'm not going to
hurt you, all right.

761
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,050
Look, I'm gonna lift
the lid a little.

762
00:57:36,818 --> 00:57:37,585
Be cool.

763
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:41,322
What do you want?

764
00:57:41,423 --> 00:57:42,491
Nothing man, nothing.

765
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:44,092
Hey, you're the guy that shot

766
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,294
the convenience store
clerk back there?

767
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,362
You saw that?

768
00:57:47,428 --> 00:57:48,863
Yeah man, it was awesome.

769
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,499
Somebody called the cops,
they're on their way.

770
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,302
Goddammit, what can I do?

771
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,538
Think they'll find me in here?

772
00:57:56,838 --> 00:57:58,407
Probably man, I mean they
always look in dumpsters.

773
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:00,375
Your plan was kind of weak.

774
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,244
Plan, what plan?

775
00:58:02,677 --> 00:58:03,877
Why'd I shoot that guy?

776
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:05,279
He already gave me the money.

777
00:58:14,356 --> 00:58:18,494
I just need a fix,
can you help me?

778
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,432
Yeah man, I can help
you, I can ease your pain.

779
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,769
Okay, please help
me out of this shit.

780
00:58:28,537 --> 00:58:29,838
Hey who, what's
that on your neck?

781
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,039
I got like a bug or something?

782
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:03,739
Nighty night.

783
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:26,494
Crap.

784
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:38,206
Hello?

785
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:40,041
Buddy, hey, it's Stan.

786
00:59:42,043 --> 00:59:43,811
He's kind of dopey
Billy, you know.

787
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:45,713
I mean, he talked real slow.

788
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:47,316
Here, here.

789
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:50,351
If he's so dopey, why
did he come see you?

790
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,521
I don't know, it was
pretty informal, really.

791
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:55,023
Routine he said, yeah.

792
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:57,124
Hell, he even
picked up the check.

793
00:59:57,358 --> 00:59:59,527
You had an informal
meeting with the detective?

794
00:59:59,894 --> 01:00:01,395
It was just some
questions about Thelma.

795
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:03,298
You know, when's the
last time I saw her?

796
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:06,401
That was one, did anybody
have any problems with her?

797
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:07,769
Yeah, that was another one.

798
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:09,103
Here
at the convenience

799
01:00:09,104 --> 01:00:10,304
store
But you know

800
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:12,072
he did mention the
cyanide though.

801
01:00:12,073 --> 01:00:13,842
He mentioned
the cyanide, Stan?

802
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:17,646
You told me cyanide was
undetectable, you said that.

803
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:18,947
Well that's
what I thought.

804
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:19,914
That's what you thought?

805
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:21,082
Yeah

806
01:00:21,148 --> 01:00:22,550
You didn't
know it for sure?

807
01:00:22,617 --> 01:00:24,018
Sir, there
was some speculation earlier

808
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:25,754
that the killer of the
convenience store shooter

809
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,654
from earlier this
afternoon may have been

810
01:00:27,655 --> 01:00:28,990
the work from "The Dart Man"?

811
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:30,492
It's a routine investigation,
that's what he said.

812
01:00:31,492 --> 01:00:32,960
Buddy, there ain't
nothing routine

813
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,664
about Thelma's death now
that they've found cyanide.

814
01:00:37,064 --> 01:00:38,266
How many people do you think

815
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,402
die naturally of
cyanide poisoning?

816
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:43,971
If you would stop glamorizing
him into being some kind

817
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:45,940
of super hero, because he's not.

818
01:00:45,941 --> 01:00:48,208
People, we have, we
have a pathetic loser

819
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:50,844
here on the loose
who is randomingly

820
01:00:50,845 --> 01:00:53,715
killing people for the
sheer pleasure of it.

821
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:56,183
For a dopey guy, he's
doing a pretty smart job.

822
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,854
Soon he'll be wanting
to have coffee with me.

823
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:04,927
Well he kind of sort of
did ask me who you were.

824
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:08,530
But I know he seemed more
interested in Flip, Billy.

825
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:09,898
In Flip?

826
01:01:09,963 --> 01:01:12,132
Yeah, yeah, well I,
I guess he thinks he's,

827
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:14,802
he looks more like a
criminal than I do.

828
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:18,173
Yeah. He wants
to have coffee with him.

829
01:01:18,673 --> 01:01:19,806
Coffee, what coffee, what?

830
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:21,677
What is it with
this guy and coffee?

831
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:23,344
You have sacrificed here

832
01:01:23,345 --> 01:01:27,215
a moral imperative for
sheer sensationalism,

833
01:01:27,481 --> 01:01:29,418
and that is unacceptable,
unacceptable.

834
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:32,553
Paul Jordan, good
night and good luck.

835
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:34,689
You ask me if I'm close?

836
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:36,525
I'm close to having a
nervous breakdown, thank you.

837
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,125
I don't think there's
any reason to panic.

838
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,461
I think we're going to be okay.

839
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,930
No, we are not going
to be okay, Stan.

840
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:44,967
I don't like the
sound of any of this.

841
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,801
The fact that he's
already talked to you

842
01:01:46,802 --> 01:01:48,303
let's me know that he's onto us.

843
01:01:52,374 --> 01:01:54,443
Don't you think you're over
reacting just a little bit?

844
01:01:54,575 --> 01:01:58,280
No, no, I do not
think I'm over reacting.

845
01:01:58,914 --> 01:02:00,349
I think I'm under reacting.

846
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:03,851
All the shit I got
going on at home

847
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:05,621
and now you bring
this to my door, too.

848
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:08,490
Your damned ex-wife.

849
01:02:09,523 --> 01:02:10,992
Don't matter whether
she's dead or alive,

850
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:12,361
she's still fucking us both.

851
01:02:15,262 --> 01:02:17,297
You do not agree to any
more coffee meetings

852
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:19,101
with this detective, right?

853
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,769
I don't care if he pays or not.

854
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,206
You're under no
obligation to talk to him.

855
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,311
Okay, I won't, but what
the hell are we going to do?

856
01:02:32,314 --> 01:02:33,482
I'll figure something out.

857
01:02:42,456 --> 01:02:43,391
Come in.

858
01:02:46,293 --> 01:02:47,461
You have a moment?

859
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:51,233
Yeah, sure.

860
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:54,101
We really need to talk.

861
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,142
Okay, let's talk.

862
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:03,311
Here?

863
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:06,881
Yeah, what's wrong with here?

864
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:08,582
Why not?

865
01:03:09,217 --> 01:03:12,921
Bill, it hasn't been so good
with us for quite a while.

866
01:03:14,856 --> 01:03:19,861
That's a shocker,
get to the point.

867
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:24,865
All right, I want
you to move out.

868
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:27,169
It can't go on like this.

869
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:36,077
You want me to
move out of my house?

870
01:03:38,046 --> 01:03:41,216
You want me to move out of my
parents' house, are you crazy?

871
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,319
I'm divorcing you,
Bill, you're gonna have

872
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,055
to move out sooner or later.

873
01:03:47,255 --> 01:03:49,557
Is that right?
Who's the lucky guy?

874
01:03:50,624 --> 01:03:51,559
What are you talking about?

875
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,760
There's no one else.

876
01:03:56,631 --> 01:03:58,467
I'll move out of this
house when I'm dead.

877
01:04:00,602 --> 01:04:01,837
Close the door.

878
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:05,806
I'm sorry.

879
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,645
Get your ridiculous
clown face out of here.

880
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:22,289
Hey it's Bill, isn't it?

881
01:04:24,358 --> 01:04:25,459
Do I know you?

882
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,963
Not if you don't watch TV

883
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:31,032
No sir, I don't.

884
01:04:31,398 --> 01:04:34,468
That's okay, we can't
arrest you for that, right?

885
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:36,938
I'm Paul Jordan, a detective.

886
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:38,840
This is Detective Brent.

887
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,610
Yeah, that's some cool
rig you got here Billy.

888
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:45,781
What, are you in the
extermination business, man?

889
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,184
No sir, I'm in fire safety.

890
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:54,622
Yeah, what? Now
that's 30 years on the job?

891
01:04:56,992 --> 01:05:00,528
Shit, the older
I get, the worst I see.

892
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,531
I thought I saw the worst.

893
01:05:03,798 --> 01:05:05,031
Hey gentlemen,
if you don't mind,

894
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:06,433
I got places to be,
I'm a schedule today.

895
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:09,171
Hey, don't let us hold
you, go split, that's cool.

896
01:05:10,137 --> 01:05:14,409
But you know, you're not,
you're not curious, man.

897
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,544
How I know your name?

898
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:18,914
No sir.

899
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,115
No?

900
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:24,252
How about you, Brent? Curious?

901
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:26,788
Yeah, I find it
extremely curious.

902
01:05:27,722 --> 01:05:31,293
Well, I assumed
you ran my plates.

903
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,027
No, I didn't need to.

904
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:34,396
Your buddy Stan, he
gave me your name.

905
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:35,996
He's cool, I like Stan.

906
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:38,400
We had a long chat,
yeah, very cool.

907
01:05:38,633 --> 01:05:40,135
Yeah, Stan's a great guy.

908
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:42,637
Yeah, but he didn't
mention me to you?

909
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:44,872
No sir.

910
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:47,374
Bam! I'm disappointed.

911
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:52,981
That's wild, yeah.

912
01:05:59,454 --> 01:06:01,323
So, what is it with
you and Stanley then?

913
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:04,258
You're not, you're not
particularly close?

914
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,963
We've been friends
for years, we're close.

915
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:09,664
But you don't talk?

916
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:12,367
Yeah, we talk, yeah.

917
01:06:12,432 --> 01:06:13,901
Well, I mean, there's
things you don't talk about?

918
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:18,106
I'm not his wife, Detective.

919
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:19,608
Well, that's
probably a good thing.

920
01:06:19,707 --> 01:06:24,713
He's already had three.

921
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:27,614
Hey gentlemen, do you mind,

922
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:28,849
could we get to
the point, please?

923
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:30,750
Shit, there's no
point, there's no point.

924
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:32,219
We're going to go.

925
01:06:33,287 --> 01:06:35,556
No, I'm not gonna rain on
the parade, so to speak, man.

926
01:06:35,622 --> 01:06:37,123
But I'll tell you something
I could not do your job, man.

927
01:06:37,124 --> 01:06:39,058
Being on the road all
day, all day with assholes

928
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:43,430
Breathing their shit,
I'd snap, I'd snap.

929
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:48,903
Fuck it, I'd take a few of
them out, yes siree bob!

930
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:54,175
It's frustrating
some days, yeah.

931
01:06:55,876 --> 01:06:56,977
I like to drive.

932
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:58,446
Yeah?

933
01:06:58,546 --> 01:06:59,614
People aren't so bad.

934
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:09,624
Man, that is beautiful.

935
01:07:12,827 --> 01:07:14,729
Somebody's been a bad boy.

936
01:07:15,563 --> 01:07:16,965
You drinkin' and drivin' Billy?

937
01:07:18,265 --> 01:07:22,369
You been a bad boy?

938
01:07:22,537 --> 01:07:23,538
You got a problem
with the sauce?

939
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:28,443
Not any more.

940
01:07:34,648 --> 01:07:35,849
You gentlemen have a good day.

941
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:37,953
You too, Bill.

942
01:07:38,552 --> 01:07:40,721
Think about it, man,
we'll see you soon.

943
01:08:22,863 --> 01:08:26,534
Bill, someone's at the
door, can you see who it is?

944
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:27,736
Shut up, Vera.

945
01:08:33,674 --> 01:08:34,942
Billy boy.

946
01:08:41,683 --> 01:08:43,084
Is everything all right here?

947
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:45,452
What?

948
01:08:46,054 --> 01:08:47,887
I've been knocking here
for five minutes, you know.

949
01:08:47,888 --> 01:08:49,556
You certainly take
your goddamned time.

950
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:51,692
Is there something here going
on that I don't know about?

951
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,194
You all right?

952
01:08:54,829 --> 01:08:56,598
Detective, do you
know what time it is?

953
01:08:57,098 --> 01:08:58,433
Yeah, it's five
after midnight.

954
01:08:59,534 --> 01:09:01,000
You make a habit
of visiting suspects

955
01:09:01,001 --> 01:09:02,704
at five after midnight?

956
01:09:02,769 --> 01:09:04,737
Suspect? What are
you talking about?

957
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:05,972
You consider yourself a suspect.

958
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:07,174
Suspect, for what?

959
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,875
You done something I
need to know about?

960
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,244
No! You been a bad boy?

961
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:11,813
No! I'm here.

962
01:09:12,513 --> 01:09:14,080
When a guy gets a
visit from the police

963
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:16,651
after midnight, he tends
to assume the worst.

964
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:19,354
Yeah, well, you know,
that ain't a bad point,

965
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,320
but you know, not
when the visit is

966
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:23,357
in an unofficial capacity,
don't give me that shit.

967
01:09:24,858 --> 01:09:26,428
Unofficial capacity?

968
01:09:26,827 --> 01:09:27,762
Yeah.

969
01:09:28,362 --> 01:09:29,798
Detective, what do you want?

970
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:33,067
You said you liked to drive.

971
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:34,302
I drove over here.

972
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:36,438
I brought my truck,
I got my rig.

973
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:38,572
You showed me your rig,
I want to show you mine.

974
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,342
That's all, we'll
go for a drive.

975
01:09:41,608 --> 01:09:43,010
You want me to
look at your truck?

976
01:09:44,612 --> 01:09:46,915
Yeah, I drove it
all the way over here.

977
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:50,418
Five after midnight you
want me to look at your truck?

978
01:09:51,018 --> 01:09:53,420
Billy, you see that rocker?

979
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:58,026
I'm only rockin',
when you're ready.

980
01:10:09,003 --> 01:10:10,004
So what do you think?

981
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:14,875
These are the streets, Bill.

982
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:18,246
What streets?

983
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:22,784
The streets I drove
twenty years, man.

984
01:10:24,052 --> 01:10:27,822
Most of my soul grew right here.

985
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:33,728
Yeah, most of my soul.

986
01:10:34,929 --> 01:10:36,965
You don't mind if I
call you Bill, do you?

987
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,567
No, everybody else does.

988
01:10:40,902 --> 01:10:44,405
Yeah. That's
funny stuff, man.

989
01:10:44,539 --> 01:10:47,207
That's
funny shit, you know.

990
01:10:47,642 --> 01:10:49,476
I got to do more of that
funny stuff back, you know.

991
01:10:49,477 --> 01:10:52,780
Everybody else does.

992
01:10:53,281 --> 01:10:56,985
Shit.

993
01:11:04,925 --> 01:11:06,126
You see that place?

994
01:11:08,162 --> 01:11:12,767
That's bad people, Bill,
I mean bad.

995
01:11:12,832 --> 01:11:14,536
We'll burn that to the
ground, you and me.

996
01:11:15,036 --> 01:11:19,207
With every one in
it, nobody cares.

997
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:24,879
And I mean nobody.

998
01:11:25,179 --> 01:11:26,346
You see what I'm saying?

999
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:27,514
I'm still loving the
skunks here, man.

1000
01:11:28,348 --> 01:11:29,883
It's the funny stuff, you know,

1001
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:32,320
the funny stuff,
it just slips away.

1002
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:35,990
It all comes from a place,
you know, the rage and shit.

1003
01:11:36,924 --> 01:11:39,059
Rage, you know rage, right?

1004
01:11:40,827 --> 01:11:42,229
Sure is a scary area.

1005
01:11:42,563 --> 01:11:45,900
I don't know, I think
it's not scarier than this.

1006
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,795
So what's going on, Detective?

1007
01:12:16,964 --> 01:12:18,365
Why the hell did
you bring me here?

1008
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:26,973
You know, I got
to get home, I got

1009
01:12:26,974 --> 01:12:28,175
to work in the morning.

1010
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:33,214
I know, you got
to exterminate.

1011
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:36,150
You got to exterminate problems.

1012
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:37,750
I'm in fire safety.

1013
01:12:37,751 --> 01:12:39,387
I'm talking about
those bugs, Billy.

1014
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:42,257
Those bugs, who is going
to exterminate them?

1015
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:44,157
Cause somebody's got to do
something before it's too late.

1016
01:12:45,226 --> 01:12:46,893
They got to be
exterminated, you know.

1017
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:51,198
Like crops
just like that.

1018
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,769
That's how you exterminate
them, not with poisons.

1019
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,840
Now you got to watch, you
know, you cut and run.

1020
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:01,442
You got to watch, man.

1021
01:13:01,508 --> 01:13:04,746
You got to watch,
that life just leaves.

1022
01:13:06,613 --> 01:13:10,884
That's a high, it
really is a high.

1023
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:18,092
This is a high like there's
nothing else on Earth.

1024
01:13:25,299 --> 01:13:26,500
You up for it, Billy?

1025
01:13:27,802 --> 01:13:29,269
Think you mad like me?

1026
01:13:31,638 --> 01:13:34,976
You ready to
exterminate?

1027
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,147
Maybe you want to go
after the big bugs?

1028
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:41,948
The black colored
mother fuckers!

1029
01:13:42,014 --> 01:13:46,553
Yeah, the mood calls, crush
them into the goddamned floor.

1030
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:50,191
You don't need them, we're a
team, we'll make a difference.

1031
01:13:50,424 --> 01:13:53,561
Be like Gods! Be like Gods!

1032
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,031
What do you say?

1033
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,203
I'm not so sure
about that, Detective.

1034
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:04,505
Paul!

1035
01:14:06,874 --> 01:14:09,376
I call you Bill,
you call me Paul.

1036
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:12,280
Okay, Paul.

1037
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:13,947
Good.

1038
01:14:19,586 --> 01:14:20,588
You see that shit?

1039
01:14:20,787 --> 01:14:21,755
That's what I'm talking about.

1040
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:23,022
You gonna let that shit slide?

1041
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:23,990
You gonna let it slide, are we?

1042
01:14:23,991 --> 01:14:26,427
No fuckin' way, why Billy, why?

1043
01:14:26,693 --> 01:14:29,731
I tell you why, cause they
don't own the goddamned street.

1044
01:14:29,796 --> 01:14:31,499
We do! You get it?

1045
01:14:33,901 --> 01:14:37,104
Look, I got to
get home, all right?

1046
01:14:37,537 --> 01:14:39,240
I ain't gonna take this shit.

1047
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:40,640
What do I got to do?

1048
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:41,941
I'm gonna show you a real man

1049
01:14:41,942 --> 01:14:44,378
exterminates real
vermin and real quick.

1050
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:47,314
You watch! You watch!

1051
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,686
Come here mother fucker!

1052
01:15:11,705 --> 01:15:13,273
What the fuck?

1053
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:26,586
The fuck?

1054
01:15:42,536 --> 01:15:43,838
And that's how
you do it, Bill.

1055
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:46,173
That's how the
professionals do it.

1056
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:47,841
You know, not with
this chicken shit.

1057
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:52,813
Using a blow dart, a blow dart,
I got a blow dart.

1058
01:15:53,313 --> 01:15:54,247
I'm gonna blow you to death.

1059
01:15:54,313 --> 01:15:55,549
Get the fuck outta here, man.

1060
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,485
That's for pussies.

1061
01:15:57,718 --> 01:16:00,854
Shit, come on man, you're turn.

1062
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:04,724
My turn for what?

1063
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:06,193
Crush some bugs.

1064
01:16:06,794 --> 01:16:08,396
Come on, pick one
out, kick some ass.

1065
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,996
Pick one out and kick some ass.

1066
01:16:10,997 --> 01:16:12,098
I don't think so.

1067
01:16:12,165 --> 01:16:13,434
Yes, crush a bug!

1068
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:16,804
I don't think so.

1069
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:19,273
Get out of my truck.

1070
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:20,308
What?

1071
01:16:20,374 --> 01:16:21,342
I said get out of my truck.

1072
01:16:22,576 --> 01:16:23,510
What the hell?

1073
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:26,380
Fuck, piece of shit.

1074
01:16:26,513 --> 01:16:28,815
Jesus, what are ya doing?

1075
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:30,284
Get the fuck out

1076
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:31,184
-of my truck.
-What!

1077
01:16:31,185 --> 01:16:32,119
What the hell are you doing?

1078
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,390
You having a crisis, Billy?

1079
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,360
You having a crisis?

1080
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:41,429
You have a little
crisis of a conscience?

1081
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:44,165
My conscience is fine.

1082
01:16:44,732 --> 01:16:46,200
I'm not into hurting people.

1083
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:47,868
Don't give me that shit.

1084
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,504
We're not talking about
people, those are the insects.

1085
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:50,770
You got to crush a bug, Billy.

1086
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:53,139
Yeah, you gonna crush a bug.

1087
01:16:54,008 --> 01:16:55,142
I'm not doing it.

1088
01:16:55,207 --> 01:16:56,376
Yeah, you're
gonna crush a bug.

1089
01:16:56,576 --> 01:16:57,944
-Come on, come on.
-I'm not

1090
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:59,212
doing it!

1091
01:16:59,213 --> 01:16:59,981
Yeah, you're gonna do
it, cause you know why?

1092
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:00,747
Cause you promised.

1093
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,115
I didn't promise.

1094
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:04,619
Yeah, you promised, yeah,
yeah, you promised.

1095
01:17:04,684 --> 01:17:05,652
You said it, you said it.

1096
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:06,820
I didn't promise you.

1097
01:17:06,987 --> 01:17:09,222
We're partners,
we're partners.

1098
01:17:09,924 --> 01:17:11,458
We're not partners, Detective.

1099
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:13,995
Paul! Paul!

1100
01:17:18,799 --> 01:17:20,001
I'm going home.

1101
01:17:20,101 --> 01:17:21,268
What did you say to me?

1102
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:24,272
I'm going home,
I can't do this.

1103
01:17:24,371 --> 01:17:25,472
I'm going home.

1104
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:27,741
You going home, Billy boy?

1105
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:37,018
Are you good with
a blow dart, Billy?

1106
01:17:37,518 --> 01:17:40,588
Please! Please!

1107
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:41,621
Are you good with a blow dart?

1108
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:42,622
Please!

1109
01:17:43,357 --> 01:17:44,559
That's interesting.

1110
01:17:44,825 --> 01:17:46,027
No.

1111
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,662
That's really real,
real interesting.

1112
01:17:58,572 --> 01:18:02,343
Hey, you're good.

1113
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:07,814
Yeah, you're good and ready.

1114
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:13,821
Billy boy.

1115
01:18:43,183 --> 01:18:47,554
Boy!

1116
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:14,482
Jesus, Billy, boy,
you look like hell.

1117
01:19:15,215 --> 01:19:18,318
No, I look
like hell.

1118
01:19:19,553 --> 01:19:24,558
Good God, it's 3
AM, what's going on?

1119
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:27,994
I just spent the evening

1120
01:19:27,995 --> 01:19:30,231
with your coffee
loving detective.

1121
01:19:30,731 --> 01:19:34,168
And for a stupid guy, he
pretty much knows everything.

1122
01:19:34,768 --> 01:19:38,438
He's about this close to
sending us both to jail.

1123
01:19:39,839 --> 01:19:41,641
He's got nothing on us, Billy.

1124
01:19:44,945 --> 01:19:48,381
He's nuts! He's scary nuts.

1125
01:19:49,015 --> 01:19:51,686
And he ain't gonna stop
until he's buried us both.

1126
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:54,555
He's harmless, Bill.

1127
01:19:55,022 --> 01:19:58,793
He just took me down
town, in an ice cream truck,

1128
01:19:59,393 --> 01:20:01,662
and tried to goad me
into hurting somebody,

1129
01:20:02,228 --> 01:20:04,364
to, to confirm his suspicions

1130
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,233
that I'm the killer
he's looking for.

1131
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:10,404
He even beat up his own
partner to make his point.

1132
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:12,172
He's nuts.

1133
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:20,347
Yeah that,
that is a problem.

1134
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:29,090
So what, what are you gonna do?

1135
01:20:29,456 --> 01:20:34,461
No!

1136
01:20:35,562 --> 01:20:38,598
What, what are we gonna do?

1137
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,268
That's it, what are we gonna do?

1138
01:20:56,916 --> 01:21:00,019
I'm coming, I'm coming,
you impatient bastard.

1139
01:21:05,092 --> 01:21:07,294
Stan the man,
put it there bro.

1140
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,896
Big Boy, thanks for coming.

1141
01:21:09,562 --> 01:21:13,967
Yeah, get in here,
so how's it going?

1142
01:21:14,468 --> 01:21:15,970
If I told you the
truth, you'd be green

1143
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:18,371
with envy and want
to kill yourself.

1144
01:21:18,437 --> 01:21:20,406
Yeah, yeah, I know,
it sucks to be me.

1145
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,343
Yeah, yeah.

1146
01:21:24,277 --> 01:21:28,048
So well hell you're lookin'
mighty fit there Big Boy.

1147
01:21:28,182 --> 01:21:29,683
I got to tell ya.

1148
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:32,452
All that exercise shit must
be really working out for you?

1149
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:36,623
Yeah, it's working out.

1150
01:21:38,424 --> 01:21:41,561
Ain't exactly shittin' pounds,
but I'm having a ball trying.

1151
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:46,267
Yeah, yeah.
You know I, I hear that.

1152
01:21:48,268 --> 01:21:52,173
Yeah Vee, she's, well she's
a real fun lady, ain't she?

1153
01:21:55,276 --> 01:21:59,246
She is, indeed, lots of fun.

1154
01:22:00,113 --> 01:22:01,514
Lot of fun?

1155
01:22:06,253 --> 01:22:10,191
I'm awful sorry about Thelma,
you must miss her a lot.

1156
01:22:12,058 --> 01:22:15,361
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
01:22:16,397 --> 01:22:19,500
Things are definitely different.

1158
01:22:20,634 --> 01:22:22,770
Now that she's
gone and all, yeah.

1159
01:22:24,772 --> 01:22:26,941
Sure bro, that gal was
a habit hard to break.

1160
01:22:28,776 --> 01:22:33,781
Yeah, yeah, say you know I've
always been a little curious

1161
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:41,021
Were you two you
know ever a thing?

1162
01:22:41,688 --> 01:22:45,726
You know, you know, yeah.

1163
01:22:45,791 --> 01:22:47,260
You mean way back when?

1164
01:22:47,326 --> 01:22:49,495
Yeah, yeah, you know, back
when you hand balled her to me.

1165
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:52,099
Yeah.

1166
01:23:06,013 --> 01:23:07,214
Sure we were.

1167
01:23:09,349 --> 01:23:11,184
Tell you the truth
about that one, buddy.

1168
01:23:13,987 --> 01:23:16,956
Thelma would never let me plow
the Hershey highway, right.

1169
01:23:17,924 --> 01:23:21,427
I was pretty cool with
it for a while anyway.

1170
01:23:23,397 --> 01:23:25,466
She had every right
to deny the Big Boy

1171
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,767
access to the promised land.

1172
01:23:28,434 --> 01:23:31,839
And I had the right to
seek access elsewhere.

1173
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:34,841
So when I found it it
was just about time

1174
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:37,244
to say bye-bye baby to Thel.

1175
01:23:38,512 --> 01:23:39,813
That's when you happened along.

1176
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,585
Now that what
you're saying is

1177
01:23:47,388 --> 01:23:50,189
I broke her in
actually?

1178
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:55,262
Well, not exactly.

1179
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:59,265
On the morning of the
night you first showed up,

1180
01:23:59,866 --> 01:24:04,804
she finally gave me all
access pass

1181
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:10,375
Course I was already a month
into my new relationship

1182
01:24:10,376 --> 01:24:13,446
by then, so didn't
mean shit, so to speak.

1183
01:24:16,416 --> 01:24:19,518
Well that
definitely does suck

1184
01:24:19,519 --> 01:24:20,920
to be me then, doesn't it?

1185
01:24:25,992 --> 01:24:27,361
I guess so.

1186
01:24:27,628 --> 01:24:29,429
Hey, after I take a piddle,
you want to get high?

1187
01:24:29,796 --> 01:24:31,165
A little

1188
01:24:31,397 --> 01:24:33,099
Yeah, yeah, sure, why not?

1189
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:35,602
Certainly couldn't hurt.

1190
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:41,140
The switch, the light
switch it's on the wall there.

1191
01:24:41,607 --> 01:24:42,775
Yep, got it.

1192
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:45,611
All right, yep.

1193
01:25:02,495 --> 01:25:07,500
Come on, there you go
promise land.

1194
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,309
Hey Vee!

1195
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:24,445
Stan, what are you doing here?

1196
01:26:27,781 --> 01:26:29,249
Billy's not an
idiot, you know?

1197
01:26:34,153 --> 01:26:37,723
He knows all about you and Flip.

1198
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:39,492
What do you mean?

1199
01:26:39,558 --> 01:26:41,061
What the hell are
you talking about?

1200
01:26:41,594 --> 01:26:44,697
And the money,
yeah, the money.

1201
01:26:49,303 --> 01:26:51,738
Ouch, what is this?

1202
01:26:52,004 --> 01:26:53,773
You were never good
enough for Billy, Vee.

1203
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:57,844
He deserves so much
better than you.

1204
01:26:58,211 --> 01:26:59,112
Please.

1205
01:26:59,312 --> 01:27:02,014
Don't bother, you're done.

1206
01:28:47,554 --> 01:28:48,722
Bill?

1207
01:28:50,022 --> 01:28:52,458
What are you, what
are you doing here?

1208
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:54,394
What's up?

1209
01:28:56,028 --> 01:29:01,034
Jesus, I've been looking
everywhere for that bad boy.

1210
01:29:01,567 --> 01:29:02,635
Where did you find it?

1211
01:29:02,936 --> 01:29:03,970
You left it in Stan's.

1212
01:29:05,205 --> 01:29:06,974
Stan, Stan.

1213
01:29:12,112 --> 01:29:14,213
You wanna, you wanna come in?

1214
01:29:14,214 --> 01:29:15,682
I just made some coffee.

1215
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,785
Sure, what could it hurt?

1216
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:40,974
You take cream?

1217
01:29:41,308 --> 01:29:42,809
I like to live dangerously.

1218
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:44,410
Me too.

1219
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:46,513
It should be my motto,
careful, it's hot.

1220
01:29:48,848 --> 01:29:49,849
Vee says hey

1221
01:29:50,217 --> 01:29:54,187
Cool, tell her I say hey.

1222
01:29:56,723 --> 01:29:57,890
How's it going with Vee?

1223
01:29:59,058 --> 01:30:01,227
Losing weight,
reaching your goals?

1224
01:30:03,530 --> 01:30:06,166
You know, to be
honest man, it's tough.

1225
01:30:07,067 --> 01:30:09,369
I'm still eating like a slob,
so that doesn't help things.

1226
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,708
What about the sex?

1227
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:16,843
Sorry?

1228
01:30:17,244 --> 01:30:18,144
The sex.

1229
01:30:18,844 --> 01:30:20,280
What are ya talking about?

1230
01:30:22,581 --> 01:30:25,518
The sex, Flip, you know.

1231
01:30:27,387 --> 01:30:31,524
Where you take your penis,
insert it into my wife's vagina,

1232
01:30:31,525 --> 01:30:34,428
thrust it vigorously
back and forth.

1233
01:30:35,362 --> 01:30:36,797
That's the sex.

1234
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:41,000
My question is, are you
losing any weight doing that?

1235
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:44,204
Jesus, it was her idea man.

1236
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,541
I didn't want to do it.

1237
01:30:48,942 --> 01:30:50,610
I was never comfortable.

1238
01:30:51,911 --> 01:30:54,680
I told her it wouldn't end well.

1239
01:30:56,116 --> 01:30:57,284
Just answer the
question, Flip.

1240
01:30:57,951 --> 01:30:59,552
Are you losing weight
fucking my wife?

1241
01:30:59,553 --> 01:31:02,656
No, no, no, I'm not
losing any weight.

1242
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:04,156
Then what's the point?

1243
01:31:04,624 --> 01:31:06,059
She's a lousy lay.

1244
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:10,629
Bill, I didn't
know what to say, buddy.

1245
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,332
It's over, I'll stop.

1246
01:31:13,933 --> 01:31:17,838
I'll never touch her again
or contact her.

1247
01:31:18,205 --> 01:31:19,506
You don't understand.

1248
01:31:21,441 --> 01:31:22,776
I don't want you to stop.

1249
01:31:23,809 --> 01:31:25,010
You're welcome to her.

1250
01:31:26,278 --> 01:31:27,713
I was done with
that shit years ago.

1251
01:31:27,714 --> 01:31:29,683
I just didn't have the
balls to cut it off.

1252
01:31:31,585 --> 01:31:35,454
You will not stop
fucking my wife!

1253
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:36,189
You got that?

1254
01:31:36,423 --> 01:31:37,290
What?

1255
01:31:38,023 --> 01:31:39,092
I'm giving her to you.

1256
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:44,097
She's yours, I'm
transferring ownership.

1257
01:31:45,365 --> 01:31:48,068
God, this is crazy.

1258
01:31:48,701 --> 01:31:50,369
Think of it as an
early Christmas present.

1259
01:31:52,906 --> 01:31:54,775
I don't understand.

1260
01:31:55,275 --> 01:31:56,476
I don't expect
you to understand.

1261
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:59,713
I forgot, I got
something for ya.

1262
01:32:02,816 --> 01:32:03,717
Okay

1263
01:32:13,826 --> 01:32:15,094
You mean, in your pocket?

1264
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:18,564
You want me to reach
in your, in your...

1265
01:32:19,866 --> 01:32:23,170
guys, big deal,
straight, we like girls.

1266
01:32:23,969 --> 01:32:25,971
Big deal, let me
get this, I got it.

1267
01:32:25,972 --> 01:32:30,977
Okay, okay, reach into your
pocket, it's no big deal.

1268
01:32:31,878 --> 01:32:34,848
What's this?

1269
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:40,320
This will exponentially
enhance your pleasure.

1270
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:42,120
Having sex not only with my wife

1271
01:32:42,121 --> 01:32:43,756
but with other
men's wives as well.

1272
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:45,091
What the hell are...

1273
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:47,126
Shut up, you'll thank me later.

1274
01:32:47,393 --> 01:32:49,396
Okay, okay, whatever you say.

1275
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:51,631
You like to get
high, don't you?

1276
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:54,968
Sure, sure
I'm the Big Boy.

1277
01:32:55,067 --> 01:32:58,070
I always get high baby.

1278
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:00,206
It's gonna blow your mind.

1279
01:33:00,307 --> 01:33:01,541
All right.

1280
01:33:01,607 --> 01:33:04,311
Blow your mind, but
the ladies love it too.

1281
01:33:04,411 --> 01:33:05,145
Okay.

1282
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:06,146
Yeah

1283
01:33:07,379 --> 01:33:08,614
See you just open your mouth,

1284
01:33:10,483 --> 01:33:15,488
yeah put in there, give
yourself two squirts.

1285
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:22,595
Yeah?

1286
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:24,731
It's like a time machine
back to the sixties,

1287
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:29,468
so just relax, ride the wave.

1288
01:34:47,313 --> 01:34:49,081
Sweet dreams Big Boy.

1289
01:34:56,455 --> 01:34:57,389
Surely goodness

1290
01:34:57,390 --> 01:35:00,259
and mercy

1291
01:35:28,388 --> 01:35:30,623
He shall receive
blessings from the Lord,

1292
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,893
righteousness of God
and his salvation.

1293
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:36,629
He restoreth my soul.

1294
01:35:36,963 --> 01:35:38,097
He leadeth me in the paths

1295
01:35:38,098 --> 01:35:39,697
of righteousness
for his name's sake

1296
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:41,400
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

1297
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:43,669
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,

1298
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:46,905
for thou art with me, thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

1299
01:35:46,906 --> 01:35:49,240
Thou preparest a table before me

1300
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:51,177
in the presence of mine enemies.

1301
01:35:51,478 --> 01:35:54,314
Thou anointest my head with
oil, my cup runneth over.

1302
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,815
Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me

1303
01:35:56,816 --> 01:35:59,084
all the days of my
life, and I shall dwell

1304
01:35:59,085 --> 01:36:01,187
in the house of
the Lord for ever.

1305
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:03,857
Lord of Host, he is
the King of Glory.

1306
01:36:06,526 --> 01:36:08,727
To thee Lord, do
I lift up my soul,

1307
01:36:08,728 --> 01:36:12,966
my God trust in thee,
let me not be ashamed.

1308
01:36:13,232 --> 01:36:15,768
Do not let my enemies
triumph over me.

1309
01:36:22,808 --> 01:36:24,209
Thank you for coming, Mr. Lee.

1310
01:36:24,811 --> 01:36:26,412
No problem, Johnson.

1311
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:29,581
No rest for wicked, Johnson.

1312
01:36:30,316 --> 01:36:32,485
See you back at
work in two hour.

1313
01:36:34,487 --> 01:36:35,422
What?

1314
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:37,890
Is there a problem, Johnson?

1315
01:36:42,295 --> 01:36:45,632
Actually yes,
yes there is, yes.

1316
01:36:47,534 --> 01:36:49,568
Johnson, you're too serious.

1317
01:36:50,103 --> 01:36:55,108
Relax, I make joke, you take
week off, full pay.

1318
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:04,584
What the hell was that about?

1319
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:10,857
Apparently my boss is a
comedian but only at funerals.

1320
01:37:25,237 --> 01:37:26,205
Thank you, man.

1321
01:37:28,006 --> 01:37:29,108
I owed you one, buddy.

1322
01:37:34,546 --> 01:37:35,881
I owe you a lot more.

1323
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:39,218
Take care pal.

1324
01:37:48,795 --> 01:37:50,063
Are you okay?

1325
01:37:51,263 --> 01:37:55,400
All right, I almost
forgot to give you this.

1326
01:37:57,603 --> 01:37:58,972
Daddy, what's this for?

1327
01:38:01,174 --> 01:38:02,976
I don't think I'm
going to need it anymore.

1328
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:06,679
I'm feeling a lot better.

1329
01:38:09,848 --> 01:38:11,083
It's just you and me now.

1330
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:17,157
Yeah, I can live
with that, come on.

1331
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:21,893
The Dart
Man, whose real name

1332
01:38:21,894 --> 01:38:23,361
is Flip Feinstein,
took his own life

1333
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:26,064
after killing Vera Johnson,
his personal trainer.

1334
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:28,066
Cell phone records
and a business card

1335
01:38:28,067 --> 01:38:30,837
placed Mr. Feinstein at the
scene of the final murder.

1336
01:38:31,237 --> 01:38:33,506
Poison, a box of darts
and a blowpipe were

1337
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:35,842
also recovered from
the Dart Man's...

1338
01:38:36,209 --> 01:38:38,077
Guess is wasn't that
Johnson guy after all?

1339
01:38:40,412 --> 01:38:41,781
You were wrong this time, boss.

1340
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:48,655
It appears that way,
especially with the blinds.

1341
01:38:53,058 --> 01:38:55,260
I was real sorry to hear
about your wife, Bill.

1342
01:38:56,062 --> 01:38:58,965
Thank you, doc, it was rough
but we're getting though it.

1343
01:38:59,999 --> 01:39:03,269
You know, all things considered,
you look damned good.

1344
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:05,871
I feel good.

1345
01:39:06,472 --> 01:39:08,005
Looks like you
were able to remove

1346
01:39:08,006 --> 01:39:10,309
those persistent
stresses in your life.

1347
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:12,512
How did you do it?

1348
01:39:12,946 --> 01:39:14,214
Took your advice.

1349
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,748
And you were right, get
rid of the big problems.

1350
01:39:18,116 --> 01:39:19,552
The small ones
don't mean nothing.

1351
01:39:20,586 --> 01:39:21,588
Well, ain't that the truth.

1352
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:23,823
So what are your plans now?

1353
01:39:25,357 --> 01:39:27,226
I'm just going to take
it one day at a time.

1354
01:39:28,928 --> 01:39:30,363
You're a wise man, Bill.

1355
01:39:31,129 --> 01:39:34,566
And whatever it is what
you've been doing, don't stop.
