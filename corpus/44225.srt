1
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,280
Somebody help me!

2
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,226
Jesus!

3
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:43,339
Darl? Come on in,
l'll scramble you some eggs.

4
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,041
So say...

5
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,417
You haven't seen my keys,
have you?

6
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:30,485
-Why did you do that for?
-l love you.

7
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,556
-Good morning, Lauren.
-Hi, Katie.

8
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,130
Hey, Darl, you sure were
shaking your petootie last night.

9
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,460
-Come here a minute, honey.
-Why?

10
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,461
Just come here, okay?

11
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,677
-How old are you?
-21 and got an l.D. to prove it.

12
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:51,836
Poor shit!

13
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,446
Advice for you: go to Crawfish
Bay or wherever you're from.

14
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:01,287
Work in a place like this and you
are going to develop bad habits.

15
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:05,820
-You've got a booger on your nose.
-lt's Rhonda.

16
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,995
-Darl, it's C.B.
-l'm not here.

17
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,296
He said something about
a truck wreck.

18
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,400
-Put down the shoes, Al.
-l've got 6 kids...

19
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,559
Put down the shoes, Al.

20
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:52,571
-Hey, C.B.
-lt's a whole situation.

21
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:55,308
Yeah, it looks like it.
Pass me that umbrella.

22
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:57,446
-Have you seen my sunglasses?
-l don't think so.

23
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,205
Do me a favor and look
for them, will you?

24
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,914
Some marketing!
How you doing, Bud?

25
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,780
The driver said some woman
ran in front of him.

26
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,182
-Did you talk to her?
-No. Couldn't find her.

27
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,324
Can't find her?
l'll be darned.

28
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,251
what's up, buddy?
Whose dog is this?

29
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:16,161
His license and title were clean,
but his insurance lapsed.

30
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,355
ls that right?

31
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,165
Are you hurt, son?

32
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:23,936
-Are you alright?
-Yeah, sir, l'm alright.

33
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,541
-Dumped her in there, didn't you?
-Yes, sir.

34
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:31,010
Sure did.
l nearly rolled over.

35
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,614
Listen, l don't know
where you drive through...

36
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,479
but in Louisiana you can't
drive around with no insurance.

37
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,712
l tried to keep it up.
l got to feed my kids though.

38
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,754
-Yeah, l get you.
-Yes, sir.

39
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,725
lt's an awful lot of shoes.

40
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:47,219
l'll give you a breathlizer test.
That 's all there is to it.

41
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:51,925
Hell, no, l ain't no drunk! You
find that woman. lt 's her fault!

42
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,994
C.B., make the call, will you?

43
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,772
-This is Rhonda.
-Rhonda,it's C.B.

44
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,347
-We got high tops. Want some?
-You best save me a pair.

45
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,611
Pot Goose's.

46
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,181
l appreciate it, C.B.!

47
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,956
And what they're building
right down the road...

48
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,289
is a gambling casino
that will destroy...

49
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,256
Truck wreck on 65.
Darl's giving out free shoes.

50
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:27,767
You cannot bring in Las Vegas'
style of gambling!

51
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,841
l bet you US$ 1 million
it fits that girl.

52
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,608
Hey, Goose, what's up, buddy?
You're drunk yet?

53
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,278
Sir, this is the Lord's day. Jack
Daniels got to wait till midnight.

54
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,707
Are you a son now?

55
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,583
They're tasty. Just clean them up.
l'm just cleaning the mud.

56
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:49,786
that's a 7 medium, so...
So, Cletus..

57
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,554
You see, you got to say
the magic words, okay?

58
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:58,057
-Who are you going to vote for?
-Well, you, sheriff.

59
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:07,003
Ornelle, planning on pulling
that thing out with that truck?

60
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:11,374
Before l start, l got to get it
right: who do l send the bill to?

61
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:15,915
-Judge executive pays the bills.
-Hey, Darl!

62
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,749
You ought to look at this!

63
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,583
-What?
-There's a woman out here.

64
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,124
And she ain't moving.

65
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,181
Damn, she's good looking, huh?

66
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,483
-Anybody knows her?
-No.

67
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:59,488
Nice if l did!

68
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:05,761
-Charge him for man slaughter?
-l don't know, maybe.

69
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:10,029
There's a camera under my seat,
C.B. Get it and take pictures.

70
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,240
-Jesus.
-Amen. She's a believer.

71
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,018
Good grief, little feller.
You're about to get squashed!

72
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,695
Now run.
Run like the wind!

73
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,246
How you doing, sister?

74
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,992
Looks good. l didn't think God
would let a miss work on Sunday.

75
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:45,099
l have to be open for business
before the casino is.

76
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:50,003
l'm trying to identify this gal.
You haven't seen her, have you?

77
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,408
No, she doesn't come
to my church.

78
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,409
l guess you wouldn't
know her, would you?

79
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:17,030
-Say, Henry?
-Ain't playing much football.

80
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,325
Hell, no.

81
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,230
Help me out with something. Have
you seen this little sweetheart?

82
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:27,743
-She is a looker.
-Yes. She's got hit by a truck.

83
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,779
l heard that. l don't know her.
Your money is no good here.

84
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,676
-My wife picked out hush puppies.
-They fit?

85
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,545
-Good deal. Thanks for your help.
-Okay, Darl.

86
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,783
-Hear anything, let me know.
-Sure will. Hey, Darl...

87
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:48,521
those kids out front, please run
them off. l'm getting complaints.

88
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:51,860
All right.
See you later, Henry.

89
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,303
that's dangerous! You little shits
will have to get out of here.

90
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,038
You're running off
all of Henry's customers.

91
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:08,475
What are you just standing there
for? Get in the car. what's wrong?

92
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,914
-You come with me.
-Why?

93
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,554
-Because l said to. Come on.
-Come on, let 's just go.

94
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,865
-Your mom doesn't let you smoke.
-Not in front of her.

95
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:40,939
-Who's this?
-l'm trying to find out.

96
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,445
So how's school, honey?

97
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,051
Amazing.

98
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,158
that's good.

99
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:53,985
Can l get a tattoo?

100
00:11:55,731 --> 00:11:59,167
-A tattoo of what?
-Gaia.

101
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,960
-what's Gaia?
-Gaia, the earth goddess.

102
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,108
When l was a kid, the girls who
had a tattoo worked in tit shows.

103
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,407
-Don't walk around like trash.
-Thanks.

104
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:17,681
C.B. to Big T-One. You copy?
We're over at the doc's.

105
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,184
-You got to see this.
-See what, C.B.?

106
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,826
-Damn, Squeegee.
-Wait until you see this!

107
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,154
-You ain't supposed to be in here.
-You just wait.

108
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,298
what's going on?

109
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:36,164
-She's got a pecker.
-And teeties.

110
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:41,038
-Don't say that, C.B. Jesus!
-She's got a bigger dick than l do.

111
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,005
Squeegee, l'll have to take
your word on that.

112
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:47,775
Oh, Lord!

113
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,053
-You call it a''transvestite''.
-Technically...

114
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:57,454
because of the hormone induced
breasts, she's a''transsexual''.

115
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,324
A transvestite just likes
to dress up.

116
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,855
-An accident?
-No.

117
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,494
This is the copper
that killed her, or him.

118
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,104
22 caliber, shot to the back
and lodged in the chest cavity.

119
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:16,938
Feet are cut up, so... l feel she
ran a long way with this in her.

120
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,505
The actual time of death
probably just 45 minutes ago.

121
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:26,377
Asphyxiation. Lungs slowly
filled up with the blood.

122
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,191
Damn, Darl. She was alive while
we were unloading those shoes.

123
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:36,855
ldentifiable markings:
Jesus as a tattoo...

124
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,130
but this here, that's a stamp,
like you'd get in a nightclub.

125
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:47,702
Homicide. You should've called
investigators before moving her.

126
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:51,313
Excuse me, Mrs. District Attorney,
l was called for the accident.

127
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,415
-l didn't have any idea...
-Wow! That 's cool!

128
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,383
-What? Get back in the car!
-She's riding back with me. Come.

129
00:13:58,554 --> 00:13:59,782
What?

130
00:14:00,823 --> 00:14:04,259
l wish to hell she hadn't proposed
to me. lt would've been easier.

131
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,190
-lt 's my fault you're miserable.
-that's what l said.

132
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,064
-You're getting any alimony?
-l should. Put her through school.

133
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,668
Doc, won't you put some over
this. l always love this bit.

134
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,437
-Those goodies look so real.
-They are real. What do you think?

135
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:30,585
They're not exactly real. They're
weren't real. They're real now.

136
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,312
-They sure are pretty.
-Hey, cut that out.

137
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:39,785
-Seems you know a lot about this.
-l've read a lot. l'm sorry.

138
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,227
-l just read a lot.
-l don't know what the deal is.

139
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:45,730
We don't want to know
what's going on...

140
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,131
-behind closed doors.
-Stop that.

141
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,803
l'm going back to the desk. Want
me to call the State forensics?

142
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,276
-Why?
-Carla said we should've done it.

143
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,847
l don't give a rat 's ass. Call in
the State boys on a Sunday...

144
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:05,819
to investigate a''homocide''?
They don't give a shit.

145
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,983
Have you seen my sunglasses?

146
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,016
No.

147
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,991
Shit!

148
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:31,272
Good morning, Lana, how you
doing? ls the judge home?

149
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,074
He's out back.

150
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:40,381
Take the Baby Bear. Mr. Grandpa
Bear. He's got a tie on.

151
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,187
-You've got your hands full.
-Daughter thinks l'm a babysitter.

152
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:49,063
l have done nothing to dissuade
her of that notion.

153
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,392
We have a policy problem with Darl
l should let you know about.

154
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,338
That D.O.A.

155
00:15:57,806 --> 00:15:59,740
Darl doesn't want to call in
the State investigation unit.

156
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:02,071
Darl can be mule-headed.

157
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:07,081
He should've checked with me
before stealing those shoes.

158
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,820
l mean it's been years since
Darl has handled a murder case.

159
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,021
The first 48 hours are crucial.

160
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:17,886
Some crime investigations don't
deserve the tax payer's money.

161
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,551
-This is one of them.
-l beg your pardon?

162
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:26,026
Having the wrong kind of publicity
in Le Salle at the wrong time.

163
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:30,366
-With the casino pendent?
-l know we shot it...

164
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:36,003
but, right now, Darl just might
be the best man for the job.

165
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,780
Pretty precious!

166
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:49,423
l missed you. l was just gone
for a minute and l missed you.

167
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,797
Good grief!
Darlene, this milk stinks!

168
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:01,527
-There's creamer in the cupboard.
-l don't like that powder shit.

169
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:06,366
This lady... She would like to
speak to a sheriff or a deputy.

170
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:10,800
Hi. My name is Darl.
Pleased to meet you.

171
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,415
-Are you the sheriff?
-Yeah.

172
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:16,517
Except l don't use my gun unless
the charm fails, you know?

173
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:22,115
l'm worried about
a friend of mine.

174
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,783
-You're not from here, are you?
-Why do you say that?

175
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:29,728
Because you look better
than the people around here.

176
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:36,933
-No. l drove up from New Orleans.
-How's everything down there?

177
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:40,102
lt 's fine.
You get down there much?

178
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,978
lf l got a good reason, l go
down there every now and then.

179
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,343
Yeah, l'm worried about
my girlfriend. She called me...

180
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:53,852
Saturday from Le Salle.
l haven't heard from her since.

181
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:01,290
This might not have anything
to do with it, l don't know...

182
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:03,989
but did she happen to have a...

183
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,060
A what?

184
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,933
lt 's... A Jesus tattoo?

185
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,479
Where are we going?

186
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,577
Across the street.

187
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,805
-Full name?
-Mona.

188
00:18:46,008 --> 00:18:48,772
-Mona what?
-She just had one name.

189
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:55,541
l felt something was wrong.
What happened?

190
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,079
Got shot.
We found her at a swamp.

191
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,916
-Who did it?
-l don't have a clue. Do you?

192
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:11,726
Listen, this sex question
over here is a little problem.

193
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,598
-What box should l check?
-However you like.

194
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,872
Alright, both boxes.

195
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,246
-Next keen?
-Me.

196
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,380
Are you like her sister
or something like that?

197
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:31,444
l'm her wife.

198
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:42,022
-Legal?
-Legal.

199
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,736
l'm sorry, l just...
l never really... Hey!

200
00:19:56,511 --> 00:20:00,709
l'm sorry, but it's strange
for me. l don't see it every day.

201
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:05,878
Ma'am, this is a murder case.

202
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,315
l'll have to ask you
some more questions, so...

203
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,981
Ask!

204
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:13,991
-What was she, or he...
-She!

205
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:17,323
Alright, what was she doing
in Le Salle?

206
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,762
Mona called our house on Saturday
night and left a message...

207
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,203
around 3.

208
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,942
She said...

209
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:36,047
she was working in a Christmas
party in Le Salle and...

210
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,486
her ride left her stranded and in
the morning she would catch a bus.

211
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:49,286
Sunday came
and she didn't come home.

212
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:55,602
Monday l started to worry.
l called everybody...

213
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:58,262
Nobody heard from her.

214
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,766
Last night, l drove up here.

215
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:04,343
That's it. That's all l know.

216
00:21:07,783 --> 00:21:11,219
-Where was this party at?
-l don't know.

217
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:14,722
She's an entertainer,
she performs a lot of parties.

218
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,886
-What was she driving?
-Doesn't have a license nor a car.

219
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:25,825
Where did she call you from?

220
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,459
l don't know.

221
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:33,801
How about this Jesus tattoo she
had on her? what's that about?

222
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:42,481
A few years ago, she went
through this religious phase....

223
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:48,521
She got this tattoo.
Jesus over her heart.

224
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:52,353
What about that stamp on her
hand, that J.A.? what's that?

225
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:58,164
''Johnny Angels'', a nightclub
in New Orleans where we work.

226
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,697
Both of you work there?

227
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,137
Are you the same
as she is, you know?

228
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,438
What does that have to do
with my husband being murdered?

229
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:16,583
-C.B., what do you want?
-Sorry, but we got an emergency.

230
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,744
There's a protest
at the casino site and...

231
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:23,682
-Your daddy's got a shotgun.
-Of course he has.

232
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,927
Would you mind waiting in my
office? l got to take care of this.

233
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,433
Get back here!

234
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:44,445
This was to a be a nice protest.
Nobody invited him to show up.

235
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,242
You hear me?

236
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,420
He won't let me near him.

237
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,083
-He's going to kill somebody.
-Hey, it's me! Put the gun down!

238
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:02,558
l've seen better sheriffs
in Saturday morning cartoons!

239
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,869
There he is, God himself.
Mr. Own lt, Mr. Buy lt.

240
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,903
Well, these raisins
ain't for sale!

241
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,440
Bull, you stupid drunk,
put that gun down!

242
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:18,811
-Stay back! He's crazy!
-All bark and no bite!

243
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:20,709
Flatter than yesterday's beer.

244
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,077
You are gone.
There's nothing left.

245
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,517
l'm a dangerous man.
l'm a killer!

246
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:32,883
lf you were to kill me, you'd
have killed me a long time ago.

247
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:34,521
Give me that gun.

248
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,329
-Get him out of my site.
-Come on, daddy. Get up.

249
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,278
Get off this hill, damn it. What
are you doing shooting at things?

250
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,880
l don't believe it would do any
good to lock him up. Do you?

251
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,456
How are you coming with
that freak murder?

252
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:08,926
We made an l.D.
She came from New Orleans.

253
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:13,158
l figured. All shit that floats
ends up in New Orleans.

254
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:14,992
That's for sure.

255
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,540
Darl, l don't want you to make
too much noise with that case.

256
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:25,569
l'd hate to have the newspapers
stick the words Le Salle parish...

257
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:28,113
and transsexual murder
in the same headline.

258
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,039
l hear you.

259
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:41,462
See if you can talk some sense
into that alcohol soaked head.

260
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,691
All right.

261
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:06,685
That son of a bitch! That judge's
a tad wacker, that's what!

262
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:11,622
He's brought up every land this
side of the lake, except mine.

263
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:15,126
And l'll fry in hell before l sell
out to that son of a bitch!

264
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,294
No, sir, not for Fort Knox!

265
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:23,069
When he asked for my badge,
l thought ''how bad can that be''?

266
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:27,402
lt 's only a piece of tin. l
didn't realize that that badge...

267
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:33,037
was my skin. lt held me together.
Don't let him do that to you.

268
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:38,079
-Don't have to worry about me.
-l don't.

269
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:42,422
Your brother took the wrong turn.
Took after your momma.

270
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:47,323
But you are me.

271
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:04,634
-Big chief to station 1.
-Station 1.

272
00:26:06,014 --> 00:26:10,474
Tell that Scarlet person to go
back to New Orleans. l'm tied up.

273
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:14,083
She's left already. But she wasn't
going back to New Orleans.

274
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,119
She said she was going
by the bus station...

275
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,454
see if anybody had seen
her husband. Over.

276
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:21,759
All right.

277
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:28,696
l use 2 sticks of butter. No
more, or it doesn't taste right.

278
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:33,374
-Plus, it puts pounds on you.
-l think l could use a few pounds.

279
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:37,272
-Sheriff? Can l help you?
-How you doing?

280
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:40,446
-All right.
-l was looking for somebody.

281
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:43,112
She was looking for somebody too.

282
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,384
Then we got to discussing
shortbread recipes...

283
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:50,587
Sorry l couldn't help you with
your friend. l'll keep an eye out.

284
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,627
-Thank you.
-Sure. Who are you looking for?

285
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,060
l think l know where to find them.

286
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,596
All right.

287
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:04,304
l thought l told you to wait
for me at the office...

288
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:08,101
Thought l could help. lt turns out
Mona never bought a bus ticket.

289
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:10,710
Yeah, well... Okay...

290
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,905
-That's you right there?
-what's your sign?

291
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:16,279
Your astrological sign?

292
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:20,950
Capricorn.

293
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,855
Stubborn.

294
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,922
Selfish and stubborn.

295
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,192
l'll handle everything from here.
Just go back to New Orleans...

296
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,227
Look, you think that Mona
belongs in a Petri dish...

297
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:37,999
but you're wrong. Mona was
the best person l ever met.

298
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:42,132
The gentlest person. Never put
on errors, kind to everyone.

299
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,674
You think that's easy, the choice
that she made in her life?

300
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,609
lt isn't. She's the bravest
person l've ever met.

301
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:51,210
So, you put
your prejudice aside...

302
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:54,878
and swear to me you're going to
find out who did this.

303
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,757
Okay, we'll handle that, right off
the bat. That 's what we'll do.

304
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:27,052
Ho, ho, Paradise Casino
has got to go!

305
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,390
l want 3 of whatever
those deals are.

306
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:37,960
-You look lovely.
-Thank you.

307
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:41,429
-You bought that dress in N.Y.?
-New Orleans, right off the rack.

308
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,762
-You're charming.
-How are you?

309
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:47,068
-Great, thanks.
-The governor is here.

310
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:52,670
We all know about your politics.
Come give us a bit of that guitar.

311
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,077
-Come on, judge.
-You're going to play for us, gov?

312
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:58,443
-Come on and give us...
-Come on up here!

313
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,281
-Come up here!
-Come on, governor!

314
00:29:02,257 --> 00:29:03,622
Play something nice!

315
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,491
For God's sake!

316
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,736
Darl, where are you going?

317
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,634
l don't want to listen to that son
of a bitch try to play the guitar.

318
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:25,345
-What do you care?
-C.B., l was just being nice.

319
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:30,348
Hey, hey, ho, ho, Paradise
Casino has got to go!

320
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:34,814
Hey, hey, ho, ho, Paradise
Casino has got to go!

321
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,623
Hey, Darl!
Hi!

322
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:45,230
Darl, those asshole mother fuckers
won't let us in their damn party.

323
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,061
-Get back in the car!
-Who's that you're with?

324
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,837
-Nobody.
-l'm leaving. You coming?

325
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:54,466
Does it look like l'm coming?

326
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,653
Hey, there, listen.
Behave now, all right?

327
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:10,852
-l always behave.
-You're not doing a good job.

328
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,759
That 's not his daughter, is it?

329
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,531
There you go.
Hi, everybody.

330
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:22,698
-This is...
-Party hardy girl.

331
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,304
My friend Hannah.

332
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:30,470
-Hey, l know you from the Tavern.
-How you doing?

333
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,942
This must be the husband
you're always running down.

334
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,684
Hey, l told you to behave.

335
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,853
Let 's hear it for the governor!

336
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,485
Thanks. l want to talk a couple
of minutes about Le Salle parish.

337
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:53,164
Not like my opponent, Hart
Burnson, or as l call him...

338
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:54,866
''Heartburn, son!''

339
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:58,295
He's marching marionettes
right outside that door.

340
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,567
Paradise Casino has got to go!

341
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:03,933
You know me?

342
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,439
-No, l don't think so.
-You tried to fuck me.

343
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,182
l own a picking pan in Shreeport.
This is a shipping invoice.

344
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:17,256
You stole US$ 2O,OOO worth
in my shoes.

345
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:24,093
-l don't know anything about it.
-My driver says you were there.

346
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:28,358
Well, your driver ought to be
a better driver, you know what?

347
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:33,130
My brother-in-law is the attorney
general. He'll rip you a new one.

348
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,469
l don't know who you think you
are, but this ain't Shreeport.

349
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,875
So you'd better keep your finger
out of my face!

350
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,449
Burnson doesn't want jobs
for you.

351
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:45,315
You know what? They're going
to vote you off the ticket.

352
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:48,514
Did they tell you yet?

353
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:04,201
Good party, judge.
Darl, how are you doing?

354
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:06,966
-You're cutting me off the ticket?
-Where did you get that idea?

355
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,108
-Don't bullshit me.
-Easy, Darl.

356
00:32:09,477 --> 00:32:11,945
You easy! Get your
fucking hands off of me!

357
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,781
-You're embarrassing yourself.
-Don't fuck with me in my parish!

358
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,249
-You need to calm down, hear me?
-Get your nose out of his ass!

359
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,057
-Always good to see you, Darl.
-You too, governor.

360
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:30,321
-Thanks for coming. Merry Xmas.
-Merry Christmas to all of you.

361
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:39,269
What is everybody looking at?
Just enjoy yourselves. Shit!

362
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,145
Home, sweet home.

363
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,916
What are you doing?

364
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:56,681
What did you do, girl?

365
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,351
Some girls are spitters,
but l'm a swallower.

366
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,957
l guess l'll carry you.

367
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,268
Where are you going to take me?
Where are we going?

368
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:24,378
Take off my boots.

369
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,112
Hello?

370
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,222
-Sheriff?
-Who is this?

371
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,791
Scarlet.
Did l wake you?

372
00:34:10,064 --> 00:34:14,364
l got the number Mona called
from. lt 's on my new phone bill.

373
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:17,703
-You got a pencil?
-Yeah, l got one.

374
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:22,906
Okay,it's 294-367 2.

375
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,007
Got it?

376
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,674
l called there a bunch of times.
Nobody ever answers.

377
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:34,115
This is kind of late.

378
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,681
l don't know what to do
with her things.

379
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:41,986
Have you ever lost
anybody close?

380
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,488
Yeah.

381
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,134
l'm sorry.

382
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,574
-So, good night.
Good night.

383
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,005
Hey, Carla.
Listen...

384
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:29,042
l said some pretty ugly things
last night.

385
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:33,709
-l made a fool out of myself.
-Yes, we all remember very well.

386
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:37,075
l remember pretty well.
l'm very sorry.

387
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:43,951
She's watching us, so let 's
be civil with each other.

388
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,886
What are you doing for Christmas?
Drive up to your momma's?

389
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:53,198
No, because l only get a day off.
lt 's too far to drive.

390
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,601
She won't speak to you.
At least try to do that.

391
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,605
Yeah, l guess not.

392
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:01,207
Darl, there were a lot of phone
calls made about you last night.

393
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:04,709
-Phone calls don't scare me.
-lf you heard them, you'd be.

394
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,905
Watch your back.

395
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,752
Let me make a deal with you:
invite me over for Christmas.

396
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,355
l'll bring a tree, a turkey and
fruit cake. We'll have a big...

397
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:20,654
You think you can act like an ass,
show up and everything be fine?

398
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:25,154
You don't get off for free. You're
a cop, you should know.

399
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,835
lf you want to come over in the
afternoon to see Ashley, fine.

400
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,335
There's a party in
Baton Rouge l'm going to.

401
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,401
ls that right?

402
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,777
-l bet the governor will be there.
-Move your car.

403
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,702
Hey, judge.

404
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:07,868
Let 's just get right to the point.

405
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,807
lf you're taking some heat,
l'll call the governor right now.

406
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:19,210
Last week l visited an elementary
school and l saw this girl...

407
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:22,215
on a computer talking
to Kazakhstan.

408
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:27,617
l'm not smart to know where it is,
but l know things are changing.

409
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:32,365
What was good enough for Le
Salle parish 1O, 2O years ago...

410
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:35,525
l don't have a clue what you're
talking about! Not a fucking clue!

411
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,497
Well, there it is, in a nutshell.

412
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:42,334
The party is running Jackson
for sheriff.

413
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,174
-ls that right?
-That 's right.

414
00:37:57,158 --> 00:38:00,150
Well, l'm running. lf l have
to run against you and the party.

415
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:04,321
Your father tried that once
with very little success.

416
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,763
Don't talk about my father, okay?

417
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,701
You and him both
can kiss my ass!

418
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:19,476
-That 's exactly it.
-Excuse me, it's real quick.

419
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:24,613
Lucy, l need that voter
petition for elective office.

420
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:26,775
All right.
Thanks, honey.

421
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:31,491
Sure, Darl, l'll sign.
You're a good man.

422
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:33,817
l'll tell that to everybody.

423
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:42,899
''Always good to see you, Darl.''

424
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:48,837
''You told all sorts of lies to get
elected. They'll all catch you''.

425
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:53,540
-What do you say, Goose?
-l've already signed for Jackson.

426
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:58,179
-l understand.
-Sorry, Darl.

427
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,990
-Keep trash of my parking lot.
-You got it, Henry.

428
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,453
l really appreciate it.

429
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,325
Ornelle...

430
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,961
you're going to go blind
looking at that nookie.

431
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,599
l'm looking for my
car catalogue.

432
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:19,973
He's been looking for it
for half an hour.

433
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:25,935
l need you to sign something
for me. what's wrong with him?

434
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,782
Hey, sister, are you going
to sign for me?

435
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:37,947
Well, what are your views about
the State supporting gambling?

436
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:42,826
-What does it have to do with it?
-Well, our governor...

437
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,433
who coverts with harlots on the
Sabbath, our sheriff steals shoes.

438
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:52,333
Come to think of it, l think
Jackson might be the better man.

439
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:56,270
Know what l'm beginning to think?
That l liked you a lot better...

440
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,968
when you smoked all that reefer
and went fucking in your Pinto.

441
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:09,212
The Lord's arms are big enough to
embrace all who've fallen down.

442
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:15,225
-l think you'd better get with it.
-So you're not going to sign it?

443
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:22,665
"There were a lot of phone calls
made about you last night.

444
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,369
Watch your back."

445
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:33,479
-Red light usually means ''stop''!
-Goddamnit!

446
00:40:36,984 --> 00:40:39,316
You little shits stay out of
the road, you understand me?

447
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:52,455
l don't think l can keep my shoes.
Scarlet called 3 times.

448
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,368
Did you know Jackson
is running this year?

449
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,440
Well?

450
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:05,577
-Yeah, l heard.
-C. B., l gave him his job.

451
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,616
And you know damn well that he's
going to get all the black vote.

452
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:18,115
l don't know what he said, but his
deputy will come from swamp town.

453
00:41:19,193 --> 00:41:20,251
C.B...

454
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,164
l need you on my side.

455
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:37,809
l found your sunglasses, Darl,
on the back seat of my wife's car.

456
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,287
Hello?
Sheriff's office.

457
00:41:54,461 --> 00:41:58,022
l've done everything
you've ever asked of me...

458
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:00,791
haven't l?

459
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,034
Darl, it's that Scarlet
person again.

460
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:39,632
Pulled a fast one, did he? l told
you. lt was just a matter of time.

461
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,737
-He did it, you know?
-Who did what?

462
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,412
-Killed that freak.
-You mean the judge?

463
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:55,379
Who else? Nobody squeezes a shit
without his thumb prints in it.

464
00:42:55,856 --> 00:43:01,385
He's running the nigger to fill
your slot. What will you do?

465
00:43:02,396 --> 00:43:04,887
l didn't raise you
to roll over, buddy boy.

466
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:09,168
Why don't l just bitch and moan
and soak myself to death?

467
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:16,309
Let the record show l never missed
one day at work. Not one, no sir!

468
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,245
Go ahead, run, you son of a bitch!

469
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:13,158
Come on, boy!
Come on!

470
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:18,358
Come here, buddy! All right.
Feeding the little doggies?

471
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:21,258
-How's it going, Cletus?
-Good.

472
00:45:22,903 --> 00:45:24,700
ls it about 8 days
till hunter season?

473
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:28,702
-Yes. lt 'll be in about 8 days.
-Was that dog at the wreck?

474
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,300
Yes, sir. That 's Buster there.

475
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,339
He must have heard the breaks
squealing. Busted loose.

476
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,710
Hey, Darl!

477
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:40,785
-You look lost.
-l walked in from the highway.

478
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,523
How are you all guys doing?

479
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:49,957
Hey, sheriff, what you got there?

480
00:45:51,064 --> 00:45:55,228
lt 's a shoe l found in the woods.
lt might belong to that freak.

481
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,368
l thought you weren't
so interested in that case.

482
00:45:59,373 --> 00:46:01,000
Well, l'm getting
more interested in it.

483
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:05,907
-You have a party Saturday?
-Why are you asking?

484
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,347
l don't know. l guess l thought
l might get invited to it.

485
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:15,421
-You're not a member.
-Hey, sheriff...

486
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:20,053
when you catch him, you'll lock
him up or give him a medal?

487
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:24,521
l don't know.
l haven't decided it yet.

488
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,162
Good seeing you. Don't be bitten
by snakes walking in the woods.

489
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:34,004
l'll try.

490
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:56,629
Hey, Marcus! What are you
doing in my car?

491
00:46:57,264 --> 00:47:01,462
Darl Hardwick, move over to the
car, place your hands on the roof.

492
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,193
l don't know what you're talking
about. For what? Taking shoes?

493
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:07,363
-Statutory rape.
-What are you talking about?

494
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:09,767
The girl you brought to the party
was fifteen.

495
00:47:10,043 --> 00:47:12,341
-l didn't touch her.
-That 's not what she said.

496
00:47:12,513 --> 00:47:14,071
-l don't give a shit to what...
-Darl!

497
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:17,012
Let me see your gun
and up with your hands.

498
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,949
Here's my hands up.

499
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:22,820
What are you going to do?
Right. Excellent.

500
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:25,550
You marginal piece of shit!
Up against the car!

501
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:28,794
What are you looking at, Marcus?
You're some kind of friend, huh?

502
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,505
-l can get in the fucking car.
-Get in there!

503
00:47:59,726 --> 00:48:01,717
Hey! Hey!

504
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:08,992
lt smells like shit in here!

505
00:48:25,919 --> 00:48:27,511
Oh, man!

506
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,956
Here goes this up.

507
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,825
l'm recusing myself
from the case.

508
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,591
We're bringing in
another prosecutor.

509
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,398
Carla, l didn't do anything
to that little girl.

510
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:47,603
They must 've paid her off
to lie about me. That 's all l...

511
00:48:47,774 --> 00:48:51,141
l read her deposition.
You'll need a really good lawyer.

512
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:53,479
l'm happy to make
some recommendations.

513
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,005
They're trying to push me out,
that's all this is about.

514
00:48:57,317 --> 00:49:01,117
-The freak case can hurt them.
-l read her birth certificate.

515
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:02,983
She was fifteen.

516
00:49:03,423 --> 00:49:07,223
Everybody saw you leaving
with her. She's Ashley's age.

517
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:13,398
You just live in your own play pen
with your own rules, don't you?

518
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:17,728
l can't shop without people
looking at me like l'm pathetic.

519
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:20,096
l'm not pathetic,
you're pathetic!

520
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,740
l married a good man...

521
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:34,283
but these last several years
l've been miserable.

522
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,017
Where did you go?

523
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,319
lt was a set up.
l can prove it.

524
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:53,636
We dropped to a lessercharge,
attributed to delinquency.

525
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:56,667
Throw out the
statutory rape.

526
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:59,810
And you get out
on 12 months probation.

527
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:03,774
Darl, l'm trying to keep you
out of jail.

528
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,513
For a cop,
it's a felony offense.

529
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,247
l'll piss away my
law enforcement career.

530
00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:17,396
l saw you serve that girl drinks.
That 's against the law.

531
00:50:20,067 --> 00:50:24,800
The condition is you can't leave
the parish without permission.

532
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:56,329
-Howdy. Need a ride?
-A ride with who?

533
00:50:57,104 --> 00:51:02,804
Gizmo. l play a zodiacal accordion
on an anti-gambling website...

534
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:06,674
and l'm a good friend of
your good friend sister Felicia.

535
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:10,779
This is Mark, my unpaid intern.

536
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:15,009
That party at Tidewater. l heard
a rumor the governor was there.

537
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,624
They say in Louisiana politics the
only way you can get reelected...

538
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:32,465
if you get caught with a dead girl
or a live boy.

539
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:37,335
-Our governor's done the combo.
-You work for Burnson?

540
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:41,172
Who l work for is not as important
as getting out the truth.

541
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:45,148
You know the State police moved
your D.O.A. to Baton Rouge?

542
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:49,849
-Records on the case were sealed.
-l've been kind out of the loop.

543
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,416
l heard.

544
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:04,668
You possess a special gift, Darl.

545
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:08,869
l'm talking about the ability to
bring politicians to their knees.

546
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,775
l can help you get even.

547
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:15,908
l don't need any help.

548
00:52:20,187 --> 00:52:23,884
lt 's a rough league, bubba.
Sooner or later...

549
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:29,692
at this level,
everybody needs help.

550
00:53:58,084 --> 00:54:00,518
Can you tell me where a bar
named Johnny Angels is?

551
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:04,850
You wouldn't know where a place
called Johnny Angels is.

552
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:14,498
US$ 5. Only US$ 5.
l'll read your tarot.

553
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:07,575
So, is he dead?

554
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:12,186
No. Not officially, no.

555
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:14,650
Have you come in to do
a little Christmas shopping?

556
00:55:15,195 --> 00:55:19,427
l'm on a case. l thought you might
know where Johnny Angels is.

557
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:22,328
You're a little out of your
jurisdiction, aren't you, sheriff?

558
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:26,601
Nice place you've got, though.

559
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:31,441
This is Luna, my partner.

560
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:34,811
This is Darl.

561
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,479
My, my, the sheriff!

562
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:42,485
-Oh, we've heard about you.
-Well, l'm not a sheriff anymore.

563
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,485
There's a story right there.

564
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,057
Any freak on the street can tell
you where Johnny Angels is.

565
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,925
Why did you come in here, Darl?

566
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:56,157
Well, it is Christmas, you know?

567
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,664
So l thought l'd just
come by and say...

568
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,209
Maybe say you're sorry?

569
00:56:05,578 --> 00:56:07,637
See if you were alive.

570
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:16,646
-Y'all got a lot of diseases.
-How considerate of you.

571
00:56:18,591 --> 00:56:20,718
Good to know
you haven't changed a bit.

572
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:28,263
Canal and Belvedere Street.
Green door behind a warehouse.

573
00:56:29,002 --> 00:56:31,698
-Merry Christmas, Darl.
-Yeah, Merry Christmas.

574
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:44,843
-Hey, gorgeous, look at you.
-Watch the nails.

575
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:54,916
what's in the bag?

576
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,823
-lt 's a shoe.
-Let 's see.

577
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:01,661
Nice.

578
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:07,767
''A stamp, like you'd
get in a nightclub.''

579
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,499
Hello, cowboy.

580
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:42,006
You're my little flower

581
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:46,477
Flower, flower

582
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,743
l remember when

583
00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:55,117
You were in my hands

584
00:57:56,122 --> 00:58:00,252
Time falls like a shower

585
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:05,624
When l see you, flower

586
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,333
There's a place where grace

587
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,569
Will take me to you

588
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,078
I'll breathe

589
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:29,011
Through you

590
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:35,017
Flower, fly

591
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,627
-Nice job, sugar.
-Thank you so much.

592
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,038
-That was great, darling.
-Thanks.

593
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:51,473
-Hey, sheriff.
-l'm not a sheriff anymore.

594
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:54,502
Why? They caught you with
your fingers in the cookie jar?

595
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:58,648
l'm being set up for investigating
the murder of your husband.

596
00:58:58,818 --> 00:59:01,912
That 's funny. l can't even get you
to return my phone calls.

597
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:06,320
-Watch it!
-what's your problem, faggot?

598
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:12,221
-Say you made a mistake!
-Relax, buddy!

599
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,601
Listen, l'm breaking my parole
to talk to you.

600
00:59:17,203 --> 00:59:19,831
What do you want? A star on your
forehead? A round of applause?

601
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,730
Did this belong to Mona?

602
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:27,002
-No.
-Are you sure?

603
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:29,439
l'm sure.

604
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:36,518
Get the fuck out of the way!

605
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:51,129
Stop!

606
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,169
Stop!

607
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,405
-What?
-l found out where the party was.

608
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:01,937
Tidewater.

609
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,442
Two years ago, a girl who worked
in here was beaten to death...

610
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,282
with a tire iron, right here,
on the side of this wall.

611
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,856
And the cops told me to my face
that she deserved it!

612
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:19,288
lf l help you, will you
go all the way with this?

613
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,400
This is about real justice
for Mona.

614
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:27,669
So that's her shoe back there?

615
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:33,742
lt 's mine.
We wore the same size.

616
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:05,534
Darl, could you hold my lipstick?
My pocket 's got a hole.

617
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,516
what's happening, little momma?
Good to see you.

618
01:01:12,652 --> 01:01:15,883
-Haven't been here for a while.
-We're going to hop in and out.

619
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:18,587
-This is my friend Darl.
-what's happening, Darl?

620
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:23,386
-You think you could comp him?
-Comp? lt will cost you sugar.

621
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:31,466
lt 's okay. Just tell him
what you told me.

622
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:35,667
l got friendly with a guy
in Baton Rouge.

623
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:39,311
l won't tell you who.
lt 's not in my best interest.

624
01:01:40,213 --> 01:01:43,649
Once a month he pays us to put
on a lingerie show in Le Salle.

625
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,180
lt 's a deal. You ain't got to do
nothing you don't want to.

626
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,453
Some girls make dates
to make extra cash.

627
01:01:50,823 --> 01:01:53,223
-l'm not that greedy.
-At the Tidewater?

628
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:58,963
-lt 's okay. He needs to know.
-l'll never say this in court.

629
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:05,699
We finished up our show, counted
up our tips and we're leaving.

630
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:10,431
lt 's 2:15. l always check to see
how long the ride back takes.

631
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,976
We almost ran over her. She
was walking away from the club.

632
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:23,617
l really didn't even know it was
Mona until you told me, sweetie...

633
01:02:24,557 --> 01:02:26,286
that it was in Le Salle
that she was found.

634
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,819
And the governor was there?

635
01:02:28,528 --> 01:02:31,463
We're well paid to say ''no''
to that question.

636
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:35,564
Well, l hate to see a pretty woman
standing all alone.

637
01:02:37,203 --> 01:02:38,830
You didn't answer my question.

638
01:02:39,472 --> 01:02:42,305
-What question was that?
-what's the deal with Darl?

639
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:48,137
You know more about his situation
than l do. lt is a local matter.

640
01:02:48,948 --> 01:02:50,540
Somebody paid that girl.

641
01:02:51,717 --> 01:02:56,017
lf it wasn't her, it 'd be the next.
Or the drinking or the graft.

642
01:02:56,289 --> 01:02:59,884
You know he wouldn't have done
anything that hadn't been done.

643
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:02,557
Are you telling me you want me
to turn the clock back?

644
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:09,131
18.5% of my appointments have
been to women and minorities.

645
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:14,000
Nowadays, a smart,
qualified woman like you...

646
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,604
has a place in Louisiana
public service.

647
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,679
But not Darl.

648
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,481
So how could Mona model lingerie?

649
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,818
You saw her, brownie.
She had the body for it.

650
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:33,019
No, l don't mean that. l mean...

651
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:38,263
When the big Cadillac bump in
the road there you might notice.

652
01:03:38,865 --> 01:03:42,528
Here's how you do it, Darl: you
tuck it in between your legs...

653
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:44,402
and put on a little G-string.

654
01:03:45,771 --> 01:03:46,999
All right...

655
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,838
So what's next, inspector?

656
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:01,220
The phone number Mona called
you from, do you have that?

657
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:04,922
-Did you lose it?
-lt 's in a file at the office.

658
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:10,793
Well, l know it by heart.
l memorized it.

659
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:15,260
Maybe you'll have better luck.

660
01:04:16,235 --> 01:04:19,466
-Are all the girls here lesbians?
-Well, some of them.

661
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:23,064
Now, you see the worst side
of men working here.

662
01:04:26,646 --> 01:04:27,840
So you worked here?

663
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,776
Yeah. Tips are good,
money is good.

664
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:36,847
So do you have to do that tuck
in job yourself, l mean...

665
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,482
Darl, it's eating you up,
isn't it?

666
01:04:43,062 --> 01:04:46,623
-Hello? ls this Tidewater?
-No,l don't think so.

667
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,562
This is Darl Hardwick.
Who am l speaking to?

668
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:51,231
-Darl, it's me.
-Me who?

669
01:04:51,771 --> 01:04:53,864
You got the phone booth
out front my place.

670
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:57,308
Darl, l have never been paid for
that shoe truck job.

671
01:04:57,877 --> 01:05:01,540
l am not the sheriff anymore.
l can't do anything about it.

672
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,015
l ain't got no shoes either.
Everybody got new shoes...

673
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:06,412
l don't got no new shoes.

674
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:09,851
We'll talk later about it. lwant
to ask you something important:

675
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:12,314
do you know that D.O.A
we found at the swamp?

676
01:05:12,558 --> 01:05:16,927
She made a call from your phone
booth at 3 am. Did you see her?

677
01:05:17,296 --> 01:05:19,196
Sundays l don't open till 8.

678
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,031
Excuse me,
l need to run your credit card.

679
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,469
Ornelle, listen,
l've got to get going.

680
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,966
Bye-bye.

681
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,979
l ain't getting no new shoes.

682
01:06:01,574 --> 01:06:05,567
-Tell me something personal.
-You don't want to hear that.

683
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:13,983
No... No...

684
01:06:15,454 --> 01:06:17,285
My daddy is a crazy drunk.

685
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:23,525
-Well, like father, like son.
-l'm not either.

686
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:25,888
l drink like everybody
else does, you know?

687
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:30,068
-What about your momma?
-l never really knew her.

688
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:33,896
She died when l was pretty young.

689
01:06:35,174 --> 01:06:37,699
My daddy didn't know how
to take care of kids really so...

690
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,774
me and my brother pretty much
were raised by my grandparents.

691
01:06:42,448 --> 01:06:45,884
-Well, what's your brother like?
-He's...

692
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:49,010
He's different.

693
01:06:51,023 --> 01:06:57,155
l don't know. My mother's death
kind of affected him differently.

694
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,162
Probably more, really.

695
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:02,364
How so?

696
01:07:04,236 --> 01:07:05,669
He turned out...

697
01:07:06,405 --> 01:07:10,603
just a little off somewhere,
l don't know.

698
01:07:10,876 --> 01:07:13,743
Problematic kid, really. He's...

699
01:07:16,882 --> 01:07:19,715
l'll put it this way: when they
asked me to run for sheriff...

700
01:07:20,553 --> 01:07:23,215
they said they'd badge me only
under one condition:

701
01:07:23,489 --> 01:07:26,583
that l'd run my brother
out of the parish. So...

702
01:07:28,661 --> 01:07:31,357
-Who's they?
-The people who sign my checks.

703
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:36,357
So l ran him out of the parish.

704
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,105
But that's not helping us connect
the governor to Mona, is it?

705
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:52,513
-l'm going to try to do something.
-You can't drive home like that.

706
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:56,549
Look, l've got a couch, okay?
lt 's got ''Darl'' all over it.

707
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:07,798
Flower

708
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:11,669
Come to me

709
01:08:12,805 --> 01:08:16,263
Winter is almost here

710
01:08:22,214 --> 01:08:26,844
lf you drink water before you
go to bed, the room won't spin.

711
01:08:28,888 --> 01:08:30,048
Thanks.

712
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:33,486
Are you sure
you don't want a pillow?

713
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:36,786
No, l'm alright.

714
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,930
Frankly, l'm just glad
to have a couch.

715
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,528
-Sweet dreams.
-You too.

716
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:51,666
Good night.

717
01:09:25,044 --> 01:09:28,104
-l just...
-Darl...

718
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:30,441
l just...

719
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:33,810
lt 's too soon.

720
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,447
-l can't.
-No, l know. l was just...

721
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:44,660
l was thinking about not being
able to sleep or something.

722
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,693
Wake up!

723
01:10:17,529 --> 01:10:18,723
Darl!

724
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,592
l thought you'd gone.

725
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:29,037
-l forgot my keys.
-You left them inside.

726
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:32,944
Go inside and warm up.
l'll go fetch some coffee.

727
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:30,599
Hello? Hello?
Anybody home?

728
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:33,228
Oh! ls Mona here?

729
01:11:35,908 --> 01:11:40,743
l had an appointment at 9.
Are you running over?

730
01:11:41,513 --> 01:11:46,416
-Running over what?
-l'm going to come back later.

731
01:11:56,628 --> 01:12:00,359
So you know, some old shit came
by saying he had an appointment.

732
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:03,529
Shoot! lt 's one
of Mona's monthly's.

733
01:12:06,438 --> 01:12:11,137
Whatever operation it is, it's
disgusting. Did you see my keys?

734
01:12:11,543 --> 01:12:13,841
His name is Mr. Prestman,
and he isn't a freak!

735
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:16,873
He misses his wife, okay?
They were married for 5O years.

736
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:19,574
She dies, so he misses her, so
he likes to wear her dresses.

737
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,243
-ls that so fucking horrible?
-That 's perfectly normal.

738
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,912
Your keys are on the mantel.
Darl, what are you so afraid of?

739
01:12:25,124 --> 01:12:27,922
l think the whole damn
situation here is a little odd.

740
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,459
Really? You ran your own brother
out of town. ls that normal?

741
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:33,792
-You don't know my family!
-Girls get fucked by their dads!

742
01:12:33,966 --> 01:12:37,026
You're a stripper that lives with
a freak! Call that normal?

743
01:12:37,202 --> 01:12:40,171
-Don't talk about someone l love!
-l talk about who l want to!

744
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:44,207
You wanted to fuck me and didn't
even know if l had a dick or not!

745
01:12:44,376 --> 01:12:48,608
Somebody who couldn't deal with
their sexual impulses killed Mona.

746
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,248
-Shut up!
-You shut up!

747
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:53,579
Fucking freak!

748
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:15,572
Get out of my fuckingway before
l slap the shit out of you!

749
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:17,103
Shut up!

750
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,359
Mona, the D.O.A., was sent here
as a lingerie model.

751
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,394
l've got a witness that puts him
at your gate at 2:15...

752
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,635
and a phone record that puts him
at a phone booth at Ornelle's...

753
01:13:45,304 --> 01:13:47,204
a mile that away. And...

754
01:13:48,874 --> 01:13:50,273
there's this little deal here.

755
01:13:50,442 --> 01:13:52,910
l found this bloody shoe
in your backyard.

756
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:58,280
-That 's it?
-No. There's a matter of your dog.

757
01:13:58,484 --> 01:14:01,942
-Buster was found at the body.
-Nothing that would stick.

758
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:11,952
Stand up.

759
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:18,736
-ls that fun?
-Oh, yeah. You're a sweetie.

760
01:14:19,771 --> 01:14:21,102
He's clean.

761
01:14:22,674 --> 01:14:26,235
-You know what an ''imbroglio'' is?
-No, l don't.

762
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:29,845
That was one of my favorite
words in college. lt means...

763
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:33,646
-''complicated situation''.
-We had a party.

764
01:14:34,753 --> 01:14:37,051
The kind that you don't
bring your wife to.

765
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:39,416
That freak could've passed
for Miss America.

766
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:43,253
Maybe she was here,
and maybe she wasn't.

767
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:47,390
Whatever, bottom line
we did not kill her.

768
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,089
Him.

769
01:14:50,936 --> 01:14:56,101
Cletus can tell you. We were
locked and cleared out by 2:3O.

770
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,972
When that truck driver
saw that woman on the highway...

771
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,213
we were home with our wives.

772
01:15:03,182 --> 01:15:05,776
Burnson's people are on my ass
to go public.

773
01:15:06,785 --> 01:15:08,685
lf the press
gets a worth of that...

774
01:15:09,121 --> 01:15:13,490
our governor partying with
a transsexual who ends up dead.

775
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:18,419
He's going to drop like a rock.
And your casino project too.

776
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:21,528
Burnson probably set
the whole thing up himself.

777
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,494
The members of this club
are honorable men, Darl.

778
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:26,632
You want that kind of enemies?

779
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:34,709
l always wondered what it was
like in here. lt smells like shit!

780
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,576
-You threw a spit ball on my head.
-Wait a minute, Darl.

781
01:15:37,749 --> 01:15:40,513
l'm getting this thing overturned
and my job back, l promise you.

782
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:43,084
You think you know what
you're doing, but you don't.

783
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,885
Really? ls that right?

784
01:15:48,493 --> 01:15:52,429
lf by tomorrow the appeal board
doesn't reconsider my case...

785
01:15:52,698 --> 01:15:56,031
l'm going to press. l'll call
Burnson quicker than shit.

786
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:57,529
Sleep good.

787
01:16:00,172 --> 01:16:01,662
What the hell do we do now?

788
01:16:02,574 --> 01:16:05,566
Something they didn't teach you
at the Kennedy Business School.

789
01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:08,779
Darl, wait up there!

790
01:16:10,515 --> 01:16:12,039
Hold on, son!

791
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,085
We thought about it...

792
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:19,717
and we generally
accept your demands.

793
01:16:21,093 --> 01:16:24,028
We'll work in good faith
to get your job back.

794
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:25,996
But there's a loose end.

795
01:16:26,465 --> 01:16:29,059
That Scarlet person,
does she know you know?

796
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:32,804
She gave a false address
on the death certificate.

797
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:34,537
You know how we can contact her?

798
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:42,402
-She's in New Orleans.
-We know that.

799
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:46,907
l'll get you an address.
l'll give you a call.

800
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:49,750
The sooner, the better.

801
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,270
what's wrong with you?

802
01:17:22,654 --> 01:17:25,885
So when you lost your badge,
that's it, you lost everything.

803
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:29,885
-You got that right.
-So whatever it takes...

804
01:17:31,396 --> 01:17:34,763
l mean, to get it back, that's
what l got to do, that's about it?

805
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:39,069
l never missed a day of work,
l had a perfect record.

806
01:17:41,707 --> 01:17:44,039
Even after you cleaned her
off the floor?

807
01:17:46,645 --> 01:17:49,341
What? Who?

808
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:57,919
-That wasn't my fault.
-David always said you shot her.

809
01:17:58,557 --> 01:18:02,254
That faggot is every bit as crazy
as she was.

810
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:05,962
Myself, l never believed
you had the guts.

811
01:18:06,732 --> 01:18:12,432
She pulled my chrome handled Smith
& Wesson with a 6-inch barrel...

812
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:17,303
and was waving it at me,
screaming her hysterical shit!

813
01:18:17,476 --> 01:18:22,072
She was crazy! She puts it right
there to the side of her head.

814
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:27,879
That 's when l said these last
words: ''go ahead, bitch, do it!''

815
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:34,283
l made it into work
the next day...

816
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,661
l pulled a full shift...

817
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,293
l had a perfect record.

818
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,474
Here you go, sugar.

819
01:19:00,318 --> 01:19:01,717
Howdy, ma'am.

820
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,585
Well, hello, cowboy.

821
01:19:05,757 --> 01:19:08,282
-l'm looking for Scarlet.
-She ain't here.

822
01:19:08,927 --> 01:19:11,725
-She's over that strip joint?
-Maybe.

823
01:19:13,899 --> 01:19:17,426
She said you're the one trying to
find the bastard who killed Mona.

824
01:19:18,036 --> 01:19:21,028
-Any luck?
-We're making a little progress.

825
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:24,106
Girls like me got a free shot
bull's eye on our backs.

826
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:26,606
lf you solve this one,
it 'd be a first.

827
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,910
And you are so fine that l might
give you that purple heart myself.

828
01:19:34,586 --> 01:19:36,781
l'd appreciate that.
Have a good day.

829
01:19:52,637 --> 01:19:55,128
Yeah, we're here now.
l'll call you later. All right.

830
01:19:59,945 --> 01:20:03,142
"She gave a false address
on the death certificate."

831
01:20:03,315 --> 01:20:05,010
"You know how
we can contact her?"

832
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,381
-what's happening, man?
-ls Scarlet around?

833
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:16,493
Yeah, she's here.
That's US$ 1O.

834
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:27,601
Scarlet is doing it foryou,
working hard for appreciation.

835
01:20:27,772 --> 01:20:30,969
Show it by stepping up there
and tipping that sexy lady.

836
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:36,271
Hi, baby.

837
01:20:37,382 --> 01:20:39,680
Can l get you something
to drink, baby?

838
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:43,416
lt 's a 2 drink minimum.

839
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,295
Everybody in the house put those
hands together,make some noise!

840
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:28,195
ForScarlet.

841
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:36,340
-We've got to get out of here.
-l'm not going anywhere with you.

842
01:21:37,842 --> 01:21:40,367
-The governor's after you.
-How do they know about me?

843
01:21:40,545 --> 01:21:41,534
Don't worry about that.

844
01:21:41,713 --> 01:21:44,546
-You can't be back here!
-l'm talking to her, all right?

845
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:47,378
-l don't care what you're doing!
-l said l'm talking to her!

846
01:21:47,953 --> 01:21:52,390
Okay, l know him!
Gitter, it's me. l know him.

847
01:21:52,557 --> 01:21:55,082
l don't give a fuck if he's
your dad! We've got rules!

848
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,023
You can leave on a stretcher or
you can leave like a gentleman.

849
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:03,464
Come on, man.

850
01:22:05,637 --> 01:22:06,626
Hey, stop it!

851
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:10,133
Fucker!
l told your mother-fucking ass!

852
01:22:16,047 --> 01:22:20,006
Darl! Darl!
l'm going to call an ambulance.

853
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:25,890
-Oh, my God, you think you...
-Look who we found!

854
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,222
Stop it! Get up!

855
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,628
-Stop it!
-Come on!

856
01:22:38,603 --> 01:22:40,468
-Let go, damn it!
-Just get in the car! Come on!

857
01:22:45,944 --> 01:22:47,343
Get off!

858
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:49,374
No!

859
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:52,175
Get in there!

860
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,580
Let go of her!
Let her go right now!

861
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:58,444
Get your hand away from
your pocket! Right now!

862
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:01,354
-Take the keys! Go to the truck!
-Calm down, buddy! l'm a cop!

863
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:03,591
l said get your hand away!

864
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:07,325
-Calm down, buddy!
-Hand out of the pocket!

865
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:12,526
Come on!

866
01:23:12,804 --> 01:23:13,896
Hurry up!

867
01:23:16,641 --> 01:23:18,233
We've got to get them!

868
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,476
-Pull over!
-What? They're going to kill me!

869
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:28,517
Let me in!
Let me in! The fucking door!

870
01:23:30,522 --> 01:23:32,456
Hurry! Hurry up!

871
01:23:43,968 --> 01:23:46,994
-Where are we going?
-To the TV.

872
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,636
Everybody needs help.

873
01:23:52,177 --> 01:23:53,906
See if you can read that?

874
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:57,046
''Gizmo Hebert - Republican
Party Headquarter''.

875
01:23:57,215 --> 01:23:58,944
Shit! They've i.d.'d the truck.

876
01:24:47,799 --> 01:24:49,562
-Where's David?
-What happened to you?

877
01:24:49,734 --> 01:24:51,929
We almost got caught. Don't
worry, l'll tell you later. David!

878
01:24:52,904 --> 01:24:56,203
l know you knew Mona. The guys
who killed her are after us.

879
01:24:56,407 --> 01:24:58,568
l need to borrow your car.
l really need your help out here.

880
01:25:00,445 --> 01:25:03,039
-Please?
-David, come on.

881
01:25:06,618 --> 01:25:08,245
-Do you have the keys?
-Yes.

882
01:25:10,388 --> 01:25:13,221
-What does it look like?
-It's out front. It's a Volvo.

883
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:33,037
-lf anybody comes around asking...
-l don't know anything.

884
01:25:33,745 --> 01:25:35,679
Take these.
You might need a disguise.

885
01:25:36,948 --> 01:25:41,510
Being kicked out of Le Salle
was the best that happened to me.

886
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:59,168
l wonder what makes people turn
out the way they turn out.

887
01:25:59,671 --> 01:26:03,630
l don't know. Mona said she always
liked her Barbies from the gecko.

888
01:26:09,914 --> 01:26:12,405
Okay, so we tell them that
you want to talk to the press.

889
01:26:16,654 --> 01:26:19,054
Don't be afraid to tell them
everything you know about Mona...

890
01:26:19,224 --> 01:26:21,158
Tidewater and the
whole shooting match.

891
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:25,294
When your story gets out,
that's your protection.

892
01:26:26,898 --> 01:26:28,661
Are you all right?

893
01:26:30,134 --> 01:26:32,898
l can't believe l'm depending
on republicans to save me.

894
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:41,977
Where's Gizmo?

895
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,061
Hey, Darl.

896
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:07,899
Darl misread our intentions.
We weren't going to hurt you.

897
01:27:08,072 --> 01:27:12,236
We wanted to give you a paid trip
to Cancun till after the election.

898
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:15,535
Your little elves put a bullet
through my truck.

899
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:17,305
-That was a mistake.
-A mistake?

900
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,850
-Darl, what's going on?
-Hell if l know.

901
01:27:21,185 --> 01:27:24,416
-A truce.
-More like a Mexican stand-off.

902
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,557
Sister Felicia confessed.
The anti-casino folks...

903
01:27:27,725 --> 01:27:30,216
planned to pick up a transsexual
from a New Orleans club.

904
01:27:30,395 --> 01:27:34,354
-Sister Felicia was in all this?
-Partially. She would tip Gizmo...

905
01:27:34,532 --> 01:27:36,124
when the governor showed up
at Tidewater.

906
01:27:36,801 --> 01:27:41,033
Gizmo picked Mona up from the bar
and invited to work a party.

907
01:27:41,372 --> 01:27:45,638
Drove her out with a premeditated
purpose of taking a few photos...

908
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:49,678
of a transgender person
socializing with the governor.

909
01:27:52,417 --> 01:27:53,748
You killed Mona?

910
01:27:54,252 --> 01:27:56,982
No. l'll pass a polygraph.

911
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,582
-But you drove her to Tidewater.
-Okay.

912
01:28:01,059 --> 01:28:04,995
But when our telephoto lens
came out, freaks got offended...

913
01:28:05,163 --> 01:28:09,395
we had an M.O. Thought it was
for money. She was hysterical.

914
01:28:09,968 --> 01:28:12,994
lt got iffy, so we kicked her out
of the car and George Jetson.

915
01:28:13,671 --> 01:28:17,072
-You just left her?
-Yeah, bubba. We just left her.

916
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:20,705
-Then who killed Mona?
-l can tell you with certainty...

917
01:28:20,912 --> 01:28:24,575
that nobody in this room
committed a capital crime.

918
01:28:25,483 --> 01:28:29,146
Both parties committed
failures of judgment only.

919
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:33,354
Now we should negotiate a binding
and good faith settlement...

920
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,651
to keep this story in this room.

921
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:40,887
Let the campaign decide the
issues. It's what the people want.

922
01:28:42,533 --> 01:28:45,627
lf you can't tell me who killed
Mona, you have nothing for me.

923
01:28:49,474 --> 01:28:51,635
There it is.
A fly in the ketchup.

924
01:28:52,143 --> 01:28:55,271
Somebody like Mona or Scarlet
here might have a conscience.

925
01:28:57,215 --> 01:29:00,548
This place stinks worse than
Tidewater. Let's get out of here.

926
01:29:00,885 --> 01:29:04,321
You're the last person to be
lecturing anybody on ethics.

927
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:07,781
You're right, judge.
You're always right.

928
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:13,088
Darl!

929
01:29:14,465 --> 01:29:18,265
Darl, hold up. You're a parole
violator who's fired on police.

930
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:21,834
-Don't be stupid.
-That's what l do best.

931
01:29:22,407 --> 01:29:27,276
l won't go to the press. l don't
give a shit who wins the election.

932
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:31,942
But l guarantee you one thing:
l'll find out who killed Mona.

933
01:29:32,316 --> 01:29:36,446
lf anybody tries to stop me, l'll
go kicking and screaming.

934
01:29:41,893 --> 01:29:44,623
-Are you going to let him leave?
-l'm out of my jurisdiction.

935
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:47,761
You're out of your job.

936
01:30:02,046 --> 01:30:05,311
"Darll. There's a woman out here."

937
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:10,219
"It's about real justice
for Mona."

938
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:14,417
This is Darl Hardwick.
Who am l speaking to?

939
01:30:14,725 --> 01:30:18,718
"It's me. You got the phone booth
out front of my place."

940
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:24,167
She made a call from your phone
booth at 3 am. Did you see her?

941
01:30:24,535 --> 01:30:25,729
No, l didn't.

942
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:41,981
Ornelle says he was asleep.
He didn't see anything.

943
01:30:43,721 --> 01:30:46,485
Something about this place
really feels weird.

944
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:01,861
ls that it?

945
01:31:02,773 --> 01:31:05,970
O.65 + O,4O. US$ 1.O5.
With tax, US$ 1.6O.

946
01:31:07,345 --> 01:31:09,404
Well, you got it down,
don't you, Ornelle?

947
01:31:12,483 --> 01:31:16,385
-l still haven't been paid.
-Take that out of your judge.

948
01:31:17,255 --> 01:31:18,813
You have a ladies room
l could use?

949
01:31:20,191 --> 01:31:21,920
Ladies room is closed.
lt's unclean.

950
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:24,956
Well, do you have
a man's bathroom?

951
01:31:26,864 --> 01:31:30,095
l don't believe in that, ma'am.
There's a Dixie Burger up ahead.

952
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:34,095
She doesn't want to go there,
she wants to use the bathroom.

953
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,637
-You're not one of them?
-One of who?

954
01:31:46,517 --> 01:31:48,951
Them who use the bathroom
they ain't supposed to use?

955
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:09,936
-Where's the key, Ornelle?
-Lost it.

956
01:32:17,548 --> 01:32:19,345
Who's going to pay for this?

957
01:32:30,895 --> 01:32:32,226
What is it, Darl?

958
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:39,229
Who do l bill for that?

959
01:32:48,379 --> 01:32:49,869
You can't go in there!

960
01:32:52,183 --> 01:32:53,775
That's employees only!

961
01:33:06,731 --> 01:33:07,720
Darl?

962
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:16,165
Oh, my God!

963
01:33:28,452 --> 01:33:30,886
You sat there and watched
that girl through that peephole?

964
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:38,792
lf this gun matches that bullet
that killed her, it's all over.

965
01:33:43,501 --> 01:33:44,934
Why?

966
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:48,600
l want you to tell me.

967
01:34:03,487 --> 01:34:07,150
Fuck! Tell me you want me!

968
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:10,894
Fuck me! Fuck me!
Fuck you!

969
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:15,660
Bitch, bitch...

970
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:21,861
Get out you freak! Freak!

971
01:34:24,775 --> 01:34:28,472
-Oh, my God!
-You tricked me, you bitch!

972
01:34:29,313 --> 01:34:31,338
You tricked me, you whore!

973
01:34:52,169 --> 01:34:53,932
Stay away from me,
you son of a bitch!

974
01:34:54,905 --> 01:34:56,532
Help me!

975
01:34:58,142 --> 01:34:59,439
Please!

976
01:35:05,649 --> 01:35:07,810
You ain't telling nobody on me!

977
01:35:08,119 --> 01:35:10,747
l'll kill you! l'll kill you!

978
01:35:20,998 --> 01:35:22,022
Bitch!

979
01:35:37,948 --> 01:35:40,940
He never should have went
in the ladies'.

980
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,586
That's not right.

981
01:35:45,055 --> 01:35:46,852
That's for ladies.

982
01:35:50,194 --> 01:35:51,889
That's all l'm going
to say about it.

983
01:35:54,632 --> 01:35:56,065
Oh, my God.

984
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,608
l got it.

985
01:36:07,812 --> 01:36:08,801
Hello?

986
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:12,008
Hi. How are things?

987
01:36:13,451 --> 01:36:14,679
Fine.

988
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:17,048
That's good.

989
01:36:19,723 --> 01:36:24,285
-Look, you want mom?
-Yeah. Tell her it's important.

990
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:26,989
She might be needed here.

991
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:30,595
-Hold on.
-Hey, wait.

992
01:36:30,768 --> 01:36:31,757
What?

993
01:36:33,237 --> 01:36:36,468
l just want to tell you
l love you both.

994
01:36:41,645 --> 01:36:42,873
Hold on...

995
01:36:43,914 --> 01:36:47,543
l'll get mom.
Mom!

996
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:06,600
ln a Baton Rouge press conference,
the governor stated...

997
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:09,671
that yesterday's loss is not
the end of his political career.

998
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,638
And although l am conceding
this race,l am not defeated.

999
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:15,074
Not when there's work left to
do for the people of Louisiana.

1000
01:37:31,362 --> 01:37:36,959
Well, look how beautiful we are.
Mona is smiling down on us.

1001
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:40,099
l know that all of us
have lost people.

1002
01:37:41,171 --> 01:37:44,436
And every time l think about her
being face-down that swamp...

1003
01:37:45,476 --> 01:37:49,378
it breaks my heart. But we're not
going to talk about that today.

1004
01:37:49,847 --> 01:37:52,577
She was beautiful and she'd
like to be remembered beautiful.

1005
01:37:53,817 --> 01:37:58,049
And she'd be so happy that all of
you are here. Thank you so much.

1006
01:38:01,992 --> 01:38:03,425
l was hoping you'd come.

1007
01:38:06,931 --> 01:38:12,301
l'm giving things away. l didn't
want to go through it alone.

1008
01:38:19,209 --> 01:38:25,045
l'll confess: l knew who you were
before going to your office.

1009
01:38:26,216 --> 01:38:29,481
David told me you were brothers,
and that you were a real dick.

1010
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:34,548
We both thought it best that l
not tell you we knew each other.

1011
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,451
Cause you might
hold it against us.

1012
01:38:39,363 --> 01:38:40,990
l probably would have.

1013
01:38:42,232 --> 01:38:43,927
l'm sorry for lying about it.

1014
01:38:50,774 --> 01:38:53,436
l think l'm going to thank
somebody for a car.

1015
01:38:57,381 --> 01:38:58,746
lt's about time.

1016
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:01,941
Are you going to be here?

1017
01:39:02,953 --> 01:39:04,511
Yeah, l'll be right here.

1018
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:09,052
All right.
