1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,400
When was it I first
heard of the grass harp?

2
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Long before the autumn
we lived in the China tree.

3
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
An earlier autumn, then.

4
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,000
And, of course,
it was Dolly who told me.

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No one else would have thought
to call it that.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,200
The grass harp.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,200
The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away.

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,800
He has returned unto him
our sister Mary Fenwick...

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
obedient wife,
devoted mother...

10
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
a woman of rare virtue.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let us turn
to the Proverbs of Solomon...

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the son of David,
king of Israel.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,600
He asks, "Who can find
a virtuous woman...

14
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,800
for her price
is far above rubies.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Strength and honor
are in her clothing.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,600
In her tongue
is the law of kindness.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,200
She looketh well
to the ways of her household...

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,400
and eateth not
the bread of idleness."

19
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
My father was a traveling man.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
My mother used to cry
every time he went away...

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to sell his Frigidaires.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,200
Married her when she was 16...

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
but she didn't live to be 30.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,800
Rock of ages, cleft for me

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,200
Let me hide myself in Thee

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Let the water and the blood

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,600
From Thy wounded side
which flowed

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,200
Be of sin the double cure

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,000
Save from wrath and make me pure

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,400
While I draw
this fleeting breath

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,400
When mine eyelids close in death

32
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,600
Mary... Mary.

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,400
When I soar to worlds unknown

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,000
See Thee on Thy judgment throne

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Rock of ages, cleft for me

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Let me hide myself

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
No.

38
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Eugene!

39
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,200
I'll expect him this afternoon.

40
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,000
And so I came to live with
my father's cousin Verena...

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,200
and her sister Dolly Talbo...

42
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,600
who lived by themselves
in a house on Talbo Lane.

43
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,800
Son.

44
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
Go on.

45
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Verena was
the richest person in town.

46
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,800
The drugstore,
dry-goods store...

47
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
a filling station, grocery...

48
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,600
all this was hers...

49
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,200
and the earning of it
had not made her an easy woman.

50
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,400
Nothing mattered to her so much
as the owning of things...

51
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
and people.

52
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,800
It isn't right raising a boy
in a house full of women.

53
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,800
A few days later
on the way to Mobile...

54
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,400
my father's car skidded
and fell 50 feet into the Gulf.

55
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,200
The town called it an accident,
but I knew better.

56
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
He loved my mother so much...

57
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,800
he couldn't bear
to be separated from her.

58
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Dolly, the boy's here.

59
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm going to take him upstairs
and show him his room.

60
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Dolly! Get rid of that cat.

61
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,400
You want to aggravate
my asthma?

62
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
That One.

63
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Always "do this,"
"don't do that."

64
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,200
"Stop," "start."

65
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
Hush.

66
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,400
This was Father's room.
It's yours now.

67
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
See you don't make a mess of it.

68
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
After my father's death...

69
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,000
people pointed me out
and said...

70
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,200
"That poor little
Collin Fenwick."

71
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
I tried to look pitiful...

72
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
because
I knew it pleased people.

73
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,400
It was a long time
before I calmed down enough...

74
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,200
to notice Dolly Talbo.

75
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
And when I did,
I fell in love.

76
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Dolly had rarely left
the Talbo house...

77
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,600
since she was a little girl...

78
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
and made her real home
in the kitchen.

79
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Though older than her sister...

80
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,600
she seemed someone who,
like myself, Verena had adopted.

81
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
They lived
under the same roof...

82
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
but they inhabited
different worlds.

83
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Catherine Creek had grown up
with Dolly in the Talbo house.

84
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
They were always together...

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
and whatever they had to say,
they said to each other.

86
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Catherine claimed to be
an Indian.

87
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Of course,
nobody believed her.

88
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Dolly, what was America called
before Columbus came?

89
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,400
America, of course.
Stands to reason.

90
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
Otherwise, how else would
he have known it was America?

91
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
That is correct.

92
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
You know,
America's an old Indian name.

93
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
It is?

94
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Shoot, don't they teach you
nothing in that school?

95
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,600
I bet
they ain't even told you...

96
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,000
that Mr. Abraham Lincoln
hisself was part Indian.

97
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,800
- He was not.
- Was, too.

98
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,600
40% Negro, 40% Indian,
and 10% white man.

99
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
Folks everywhere know that.

100
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
We got another
one of those letters today.

101
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,400
"Dear Miss Dolly Talbo...

102
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
"we will not be needing...

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
"any more bottles
of your dropsy cure...

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,800
"on account
of dear Cousin Belle...

105
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,600
"bless her soul...

106
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
"passed away
night before last."

107
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,600
We did the best we could,
Dollyheart.

108
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,400
I guess the good Lord
just had other intentions.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Do you miss them, Collin,
your mother and father?

110
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,200
I think they loved
each other very much.

111
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I still remember Papa Uriah.

112
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
When we were girls...

113
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
he used to stomp around
on cold mornings...

114
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,000
and sing Confederate songs
while he built the fires.

115
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,600
I've heard the grass
tell about those cold mornings.

116
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,200
The grass?

117
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,800
Come to the River Woods
with Catherine and me tomorrow.

118
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
We've got to gather ingredients.

119
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,600
We'll make a picnic out of it.

120
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Fried chicken.

121
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
I'll make
a chocolate layer cake.

122
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
You can't learn everything
from books.

123
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,400
Je suis fatiguee.

124
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Catherine, is that Indian?

125
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
No, honey.
That's French, see.

126
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,000
Dollyheart and me, we learned
how to better ourselves...

127
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
It was going to be
our secret language...

128
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Verena wouldn't understand.

129
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,800
That's the only lesson
she learned.

130
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Oh, well.
It's all I need to know.

131
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,600
How much of you is Indian?

132
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Boy, I done told you. Get!

133
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
A tree house!

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Dollyheart. Dollyheart.
Them boards too old.

135
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,800
And now they slippery as worms.
They gonna crack in two.

136
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
We're gonna bust our heads,
and don't I know it.

137
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Like a raft, isn't it?

138
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
This is great.

139
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,600
God, it's so high.

140
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,200
The boys who built it
must be very old men by now.

141
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
Why can't we live here?

142
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
Take one of these.

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,600
We're going to look
for ingredients.

144
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,400
About all natural things,
Dolly was sophisticated.

145
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
As a girl,
a band of gypsies...

146
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,400
had taught her
a secret dropsy cure.

147
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,800
Every week we went
to the River Woods...

148
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,400
to gather herbs, leaves,
strange roots.

149
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,200
No one,
not even Catherine...

150
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,800
knew what
went into the medicine.

151
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Only Dolly.

152
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I remember one evening...

153
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,200
I went out to the cow shed...

154
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
and there were
three women there.

155
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,000
The young one was all naked...

156
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,600
twisting on the corn shucks.

157
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,400
When they saw I wasn't
going to run and tell...

158
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,800
one of the old women asked
would I bring a light...

159
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
so I went to the house
for a candle...

160
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
and when I came back,
the woman that sent me...

161
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,800
was holding
this hollering red baby...

162
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,200
and the other
was milking Sherrybell.

163
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,200
I helped them wash the baby
in warm cow's milk.

164
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,400
Then the old woman
took my hand...

165
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
and she said...

166
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,400
"I'm going to give you
a gift...

167
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,800
by teaching you a rhyme."

168
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,200
That's when I learned about
the dropsy cure.

169
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
What happened to the gypsies?

170
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
In the morning, they were gone.

171
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I looked for them on the road
and in the fields, but...

172
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,000
there was nothing left of them
but the rhyme inside my head...

173
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
and the secrets they taught me.

174
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Secrets?

175
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,400
I've never told anybody.

176
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Not even Catherine.

177
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh, listen, Collin.

178
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Do you hear?

179
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
It's the grass harp.

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
Where?

181
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
There, in the grass.

182
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a harp of voices
telling stories.

183
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
Knows everybody's story.

184
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
And when we're dead,
it will tell ours, too.

185
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,400
You're hearing dead folks again,
Dollyheart?

186
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,200
It's only the wind.

187
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,800
The wind is us.

188
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
It gathers and remembers
all our voices...

189
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,200
and then sends them talking
through the leaves and fields.

190
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I've heard Papa clear as day.

191
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,800
Classmates said I was strange...

192
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,000
that living in the Talbo house
had turned me into an old man...

193
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
but nothing
was ever as much fun...

194
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,400
as the adventures
I shared with Dolly.

195
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,200
I dreamed up stories
about us...

196
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
and late at night
wrote them down.

197
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
He's romantic.
He knows how to treat a lady.

198
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Not like you.

199
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
All this time
we've known each other...

200
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
and not once have you
invited me or Elizabeth...

201
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,400
over for a visit.
What are you afraid of?

202
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
He's worried about Dolly Talbo.

203
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
That's not true.

204
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
The whole world
knows Dolly Talbo's gone...

205
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
and you're gone, too.

206
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Shut up!

207
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,600
See?

208
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
See, that's what happens
when you hang out...

209
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,800
with them floozies
like that old Maude Riordan.

210
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,200
Maude's not a floozy.

211
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, just look at you.
Look at you!

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're not much bigger
than that Bitty Skinner.

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,800
Folks still talk about how
he got offers from the circus.

214
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Catherine.

215
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Oh, Dollyheart,
don't worry yourself.

216
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
The boy just needs
some stretching.

217
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
Come on, Collin. Come on, baby.

218
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Now, you ask me,
floozies and smoking...

219
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
are amongst
the several things...

220
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
that will stunt
a little boy's growth.

221
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,800
Here, honey.
Come on. Turn around.

222
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Come here.

223
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,200
In two years,
Catherine stretched me...

224
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,000
from 4'9"to 5'7".

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We were friends,
Dolly, Catherine, and me.

226
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I was 11. Then I was 16.

227
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,200
Nothing would ever be
the same again.

228
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,800
About time
you got this hair cut, honey.

229
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,400
I was about to buy you
a package of bobby pins.

230
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
You know, I am surprised...

231
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,200
that Verena didn't march you
in here weeks ago.

232
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Boy like you cannot afford to be
sloppy about his appearance.

233
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
I would get me a clean shirt,
though, honey.

234
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
You could grow turnips
on the collar of that one.

235
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,200
A boy your age...

236
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,000
has to be careful
about his appearance...

237
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
especially
when he has a rendezvous...

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
with Miss Maude Riordan
tomorrow night.

239
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
How did you know about that?

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
Oh, you hear things, honey.

241
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Wasn't too long ago,
your feet weren't able...

242
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
to touch the floor
from this chair.

243
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Look at you now.

244
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh, grown-up, courting,
the man of the house.

245
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Well, if you don't count Verena.

246
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Amos, you remember
old Carper, the fisherman...

247
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,600
used to have a houseboat
on the river?

248
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Yeah.
Chased out of town, wasn't he?

249
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,200
He wanted to marry that
pretty little colored girl...

250
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
who works for
Miss Postham now, I think.

251
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Well, you know,
he really loved her.

252
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Yes, he did.

253
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,000
I saw them a lot
when I went fishing.

254
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
They were very happy together.

255
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Never could have brought myself
to sentence him...

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,200
if he'd ever married her.

257
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,400
But the law, it does not allow
any differences.

258
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,800
I was too often
on the wrong side of the law.

259
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
Never should have been a judge.

260
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,400
Well, too bad
you ain't still a judge.

261
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Otherwise you could have done
the honors for Romeo here.

262
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Cut it out.

263
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,600
Lordy Lord, just look at you.

264
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,600
Ain't you the cat's meow!

265
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Older people
spoke of Riley Henderson...

266
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
with sighing voices...

267
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,600
but secretly
I admired his wild ways.

268
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,400
An orphan like me,
he answered to no one.

269
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,600
Evening, sport.

270
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
I longed to be his friend.

271
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
You want to reach around
that counter...

272
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
and grab me a pack of Shadows?

273
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,200
- Shadows?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Weasel wrappers.

275
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,800
Weasel wrappers?
What are the weasel wrappers?

276
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
Here you go.

277
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
See you around, sport.

278
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Say hi to that Maude Riordan
for me, too, will you?

279
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
Coll, how come we never
go to dinner and dancing...

280
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
like Mickey and Judy?

281
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know.

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,600
Catherine never approved...

283
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,200
of my infatuation
with Maude Riordan.

284
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,200
"Nothing on her to pinch,"
she said.

285
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
"Man would have to be crazy
to give her the time of day."

286
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I think it's scandalous the way
Riley Henderson...

287
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
carried on in there
with Mamie Curtis.

288
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Can you imagine,
with trash like that?

289
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,400
Yeah, I saw them.
They came by the store.

290
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
He bought a pack of Shadows.

291
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, Collin.
You are such an innocent.

292
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,800
It didn't take a genius to see
Maude was heart-set on Riley.

293
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,000
Still, I imagined for a while
that I was in love with her.

294
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Well...

295
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
here we are.

296
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you
for the lovely evening.

297
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I enjoyed the movie very much.

298
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
That's all right.

299
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Well, good night.

300
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh. I don't think
that's necessary, Collin...

301
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
although...

302
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,400
it was cute of you
to take me out.

303
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
Good night.

304
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
Bye.

305
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,200
Bye.

306
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Don't think I'm enjoying this,
because I'm not...

307
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,400
but we have to think about
our place in the community.

308
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,200
Now, you have not been the same
since Mother died...

309
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,600
sitting in
that barbershop all day...

310
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,800
writing these...
these ridiculous letters.

311
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,600
Martha found this
in your desk today.

312
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

313
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Now, people at the bank
are starting to ask me...

314
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
very politely, of course...

315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,800
if perhaps my father
isn't just a bit...

316
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,600
unbalanced.

317
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,600
- Where are you going?
- Out.

318
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
- Evening, Collin.
- Judge.

319
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
How did it go with Maude?

320
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
OK, I guess.

321
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,600
Seems strange
a man can't live without keys...

322
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,000
in what used
to be his own house.

323
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Sir?

324
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,000
What do you say we go down
to the drugstore...

325
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
and get a chocolate malt?

326
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
All right.

327
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Always been very fond
of chocolate malts.

328
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Very comforting.

329
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
Used to like banana splits...

330
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,200
but I didn't find them as
comforting as chocolate malts.

331
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Ordinarily,
Judge Charlie Cool...

332
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,800
was not one
to make a show of himself...

333
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,400
and there were many
who had taken advantage...

334
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
of his modesty
to set themselves above him.

335
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
It was sad
to see the judge...

336
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,600
sad to see him
with nothing to do...

337
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,200
but sit in Amos' barbershop...

338
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,400
or stop in at the drugstore.

339
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,600
Look at these prices.

340
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
It wouldn't kill her to have
a sale every now and then.

341
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
It's your fault.

342
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Dolly?

343
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,000
I need to talk to you a minute.

344
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,800
Out here.

345
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Is something the matter?

346
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
Just what goes into
that medicine of yours?

347
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Well, this and that.
Nothing special.

348
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,400
Why?

349
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, you made enough on it
this year...

350
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,400
to pay an income tax,
that's why.

351
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
My, my.

352
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
The autumn I turned 16...

353
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,000
Verena went to Chicago
on a buying trip...

354
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,600
and after two weeks...

355
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,200
returned with a man
named Dr. Morris Ritz.

356
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
No one had seen a man
on Verena's arm...

357
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,200
since she danced as a debutante
with Meiself Talsap...

358
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
but he took up
with Verena's best friend...

359
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
and Verena never recovered.

360
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
To then be seen
with a Yankee at her age...

361
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
was enough
to get people talking...

362
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
and talk they did.

363
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,000
Scandalous, people said,
the way Verena carried on...

364
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
with that fancy man
from Chicago.

365
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,000
Morris, this is Walt Higgins.
He looks after the hotel for me.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Classy establishment, Verena.
It's quite snappy here.

367
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,800
See that Dr. Ritz
gets the presidential suite.

368
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,400
And mind
he gets Kansas City beef.

369
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,600
None of those cheap local cuts.

370
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,200
K.C. It will be, Miss Talbo.

371
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Would you sign the register?

372
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
Of course. Thank you.

373
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,800
Ah, don't forget lots of tonic.

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,200
I got a big date tonight.
I got to be spiffy, huh?

375
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,600
Hey, while you're at it,
better give me a manicure.

376
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
- A manicure?
- Yeah.

377
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,800
We don't get much call for that
around here, honey.

378
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,800
Let me see those hands.

379
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
Sharecropper you ain't.

380
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,600
Rumor has it
that you and Verena Talbo...

381
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,000
done bought the old factory
on the outskirts of town.

382
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,600
Uh-huh. She is a pistol.

383
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
She's wasted in a burg
like this.

384
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,200
She's big-city stuff.

385
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,600
What line of work
did you say you were in, honey?

386
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,000
You can call me
a chemical engineer.

387
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Pardon me, sir.
Hope you don't me intruding...

388
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,000
but did I hear you say that
you were a chemical engineer?

389
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
Correct.

390
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,000
Exactly what does
a chemical engineer do?

391
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Ideas. I get ideas.

392
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,200
What sort of ideas do you get?

393
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Chemical... ideas.

394
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,600
- Thank you very much. Sorry.
- Guy needs a haircut.

395
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Just who is this funny-looking
Dr. Morris Ritz?

396
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,200
He's not half as funny-looking
as some I could mention.

397
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,600
Do peek in the kitchen, Verena.

398
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
We're having
fried chicken, ham...

399
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,200
English peas, rolls...

400
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,800
banana pudding,
two kinds of cake...

401
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,800
and tutti-frutti ice cream
from the drugstore.

402
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,200
Why are there only two places?

403
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,400
It's all right if Collin wants
to eat at the table...

404
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
but I'll just stay
in the kitchen with Catherine.

405
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,800
Don't fool with me, Dolly.
This is important.

406
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,000
Morris has come here
expressly to meet you.

407
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
Meet me?

408
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,000
Yes.

409
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,800
I can't.

410
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
I can't.

411
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Put on that new pink dress
I bought you in Chicago.

412
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
What's more, I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold your head up.

413
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
It makes me dizzy,
hanging there like that.

414
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,200
And do something
about that mop of hair.

415
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
You look like a ragamuffin.

416
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
That One.

417
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Hush, now.

418
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
Evening.

419
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Ladies of the house in, huh?

420
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Name is Ritz.
Dr. Morris Ritz.

421
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Oh, Morris.
So good of you.

422
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,600
- Did you meet Collin?
- Well, he...

423
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,800
Collin, see that the doctor
gets a drink.

424
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
Collin is my poor cousin
Eugene's boy.

425
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
He lives with us.

426
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,200
My sister is so anxious
to meet you.

427
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,800
- Let me take these.
- Thank you.

428
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
Dolly!

429
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,200
Dolly, dear!

430
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:14,200
I will tell Miss Verena
that you are indisposed.

431
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Ahh. As one strawberry
said to the other...

432
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,800
"If you hadn't been so fresh,
we wouldn't be in this jam."

433
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,200
Miss Verena!

434
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Miss Dolly's flat on her back.

435
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,800
Her bowels is loose.

436
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Excuse me.

437
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Well, you're 16, huh?

438
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah. And throwing it around
a little, I bet, huh?

439
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,800
Next time Verena goes to Chicago
make her bring you...

440
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
because there's a lot
to throw it at there.

441
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,600
Hey, what have we here?

442
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,600
The old 88. I wonder...

443
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,800
I wonder how she sounds.

444
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,200
You know?

445
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,200
I want to know, honey,
just what you mean

446
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,800
When you say your everlovin's
double-crossin' you

447
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,600
I want to know, baby,
what you're cogitating

448
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Say your everlovin's
double-crossin'

449
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,000
That little old, teensy old,
bitsy old you

450
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You should know that you're
the only one for whom I'd fall

451
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Any doubts that you might have,
they make no sense at all

452
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,200
'Cause you're a doll

453
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,200
Want to know, baby,
what you mean

454
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,800
Say your everlovin's
double-crossin'

455
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
That little old,
teensy old, bitsy old you

456
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:45,400
They say your everlovin's
double-crossin' you.

457
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,200
It's a little thing
I whipped up for Verena...

458
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,200
and... Verena.

459
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
There you go.

460
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,600
Oh, to tell you the truth...

461
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,600
the only part of the chicken
that interests me is the brains.

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,800
You wouldn't have some of those
back in the kitchen, Mammy?

463
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Ritz...

464
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,600
but Miss Dolly here done
already took all the brains.

465
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
- That's... that's...
- Fine.

466
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,800
I have the brains on my plate.

467
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
Please.
Let me pass them to you.

468
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
Are you sure you wouldn't mind?

469
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,800
No, she doesn't mind at all.

470
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
She only eats
sweet things, anyway.

471
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,600
Well, here, Dolly.

472
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,200
Have some banana pudding.

473
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,600
There.

474
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,200
Bless you!

475
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
I'm sorry.

476
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,400
An old allergy.
I think it's the roses.

477
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh, dear!

478
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Oh, boy.

479
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
See? It's hopeless.

480
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,400
Nothing is hopeless, Dolly.

481
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,200
Don't forget the sleeves.
Thank you very much.

482
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,200
Sit down
and finish your pudding.

483
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,000
Thank you. It's...

484
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Besides, we have a nice
little surprise for you.

485
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Morris, show Dolly
those lovely labels.

486
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh, yeah.

487
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,200
Here you are, Dolly.

488
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
Here you go, dear.

489
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,000
Go ahead.

490
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Open it.

491
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,800
First class, huh?
They were made in Chicago.

492
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,600
A friend of mine
did the drawings.

493
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
He's a real artist, that guy.

494
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
Aren't you pleased?

495
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,800
I'm not sure I understand.

496
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Well, of course you do.

497
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I told Morris about
that medicine of yours...

498
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,600
and he thought up
this wonderful name.

499
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
Gypsy Queen Dropsy Cure.

500
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,000
It'll look great in the ads.

501
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,400
My medicine?

502
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,400
But I don't need any labels.

503
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,800
I write my own.

504
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,000
Hey, that's a good idea!

505
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,000
We could make the labels
look like her handwriting.

506
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
Personal, see?

507
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,600
We've spent
enough money already.

508
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,800
That's right.

509
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Now, Morris and I are going up
to Washington this week...

510
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
to get a patent
for the medicine...

511
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,400
naming you inventor,
of course.

512
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,800
The point is, Dolly,
you must sit down...

513
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,000
and write out
a complete formula for us.

514
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,600
It won't do.

515
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,000
It won't do,
because you haven't any right.

516
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Nor you, sir.

517
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,800
Those are facts.
3,000 for the factory.

518
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Bill Tatum
and four carpenters...

519
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,800
working there at $1.10 an hour.

520
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,200
$9,000 for the machinery,
already ordered.

521
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,200
Not to mention what a specialist
like Morris Ritz is costing.

522
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,600
And why? All for you.

523
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,400
You're my own flesh,
and I love you dearly.

524
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
I could prove it to you now...

525
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,000
by giving you the only thing
that has ever been mine...

526
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,800
then you would have it all.

527
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Please, Verena,
let this one thing belong to me.

528
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
You speak of giving?

529
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
All these years
I've worked like a field hand!

530
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
What haven't I given you?

531
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,200
This house! Those clothes!

532
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
Your luxuries!

533
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,200
You've given everything
to me and to Catherine...

534
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,800
and to Collin...

535
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
but we've earned our way a bit.

536
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
We've kept a nice home for you,
haven't we?

537
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Oh, yes. A fine home.

538
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,400
You and... and Pocahontas!

539
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,200
Hasn't it struck you...

540
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
that I've never asked anyone
into this house?

541
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,600
And for a very good reason.

542
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm ashamed to.

543
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Look what happened tonight.

544
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm sorry.

545
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
I am, truly.

546
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,800
I always thought
there was a place for us here.

547
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
It's going to be all right.
We'll go away.

548
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
Poor Dolly.

549
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Poor, poor thing.

550
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,200
Wherever would you go?

551
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
I just wanted you to know
where we're going.

552
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,600
- To the tree house?
- Just for now.

553
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,800
Until we know better
what our plans will be.

554
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,200
You're not leaving without me.

555
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,400
Don't forget your comb.

556
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
Dolly!

557
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,000
Dolly!

558
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,200
Dolly!

559
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,000
That morning,
we began our life as runaways.

560
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Those were lovely days.

561
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,800
I'm hungry.

562
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Well, there's plenty to eat.
You won't starve for a while.

563
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,200
I stripped that pantry.

564
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,800
I didn't even leave a biscuit
for That One's breakfast.

565
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
Riley Henderson,
don't you dare shoot us!

566
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Well, I'll be.

567
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,800
How did you folks get up there?
A wildcat chase you?

568
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Just sitting.

569
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,200
I got some fresh squirrels here.

570
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,000
Had some for supper last night.

571
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,800
They're real tender.

572
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
I'm going to bring them up.

573
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,600
Oh, that's all right.

574
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
You can just leave them
there on the ground.

575
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,200
No, ma'am.
Ants will get them.

576
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,800
I'll be damned.
It's a tree house.

577
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,000
- You build it, Collin?
- No.

578
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Smoke?

579
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,200
Catherine Creek, you've never
touched tobacco in your life.

580
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,800
It must be a comfort.

581
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,200
So many folks
speak in its favor...

582
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,400
and, Dollyheart,
you get to be our age...

583
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,800
you got to look
for them comforts.

584
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,400
Well, I don't suppose
there's any harm.

585
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,600
Next time y'all decide...

586
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,200
to have a picnic so early,
call out...

587
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
so I'll know you're here.

588
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
You're welcome any morning.

589
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,800
I daresay we'll be here
for some while.

590
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
Want a ride?

591
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
My car's just up there
by the cemetery.

592
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,200
That's very kind of you...

593
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,600
but we really
haven't anyplace to go.

594
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,200
Well, suit yourself.

595
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Bye-bye.

596
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
You ought to be whupped, boy!

597
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,800
Probably.

598
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,400
Come on.

599
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,200
I want them found, Sheriff.
I want a search party.

600
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,200
But I got hens laying
today, Verena.

601
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Don't sass me, Sheriff.

602
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,800
I'd like to think my votes
paid for something.

603
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Morris, show him the paper.

604
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
I want every sheriff
in the state...

605
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,200
to have a copy of this.

606
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,800
"Be on the lookout...

607
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,600
for the following people
traveling together.

608
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,400
Dolly Augusta Talbo.

609
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,800
White. Light brown hair.
Height: 5'3".

610
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Probably insane,
but not likely to be dangerous.

611
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,400
Post description in bakeries,
as she is a known cake eater."

612
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,200
Catherine Creek. Negro.
Pretends to be an Indian."

613
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,800
Collin Fenwick. White.
Age: 16, looks younger.

614
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Height: 5'7"."

615
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,400
I didn't know he was that tall.

616
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
"Bad posture. Surly nature.

617
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,800
All three wanted as runaways."

618
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,200
Well, they sure ain't run far.

619
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,600
What's that?

620
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,200
Seen them this morning
having a picnic...

621
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,800
down by the River Woods,
just below the cemetery.

622
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,800
Where did you get this ring?

623
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,800
Come out the hog guts
when I was stuffing sausage.

624
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Well, $47,
not counting the jewelry.

625
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,000
47? Shoot!
Hear tell we can go...

626
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,800
all the way to Mexico
on a bus for 15.

627
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,600
How we able to make
the dropsy cure...

628
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,200
if we're not near the forest?

629
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,200
I think we should set up
right here in the River Woods.

630
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,800
In this old tree?

631
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,200
You put that notion right out
your head, Dollyheart.

632
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
- What?
- Oh, dear.

633
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
There they are.
Up in there. You see them?

634
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,400
There they are.

635
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Say! Now, looky here.

636
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,400
Now, Sheriff, we agreed
to leave this to the reverend.

637
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,800
Dolly Talbo,
on behalf of your sister...

638
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,800
that good and gracious woman...

639
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,200
That she is.

640
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Who on this day has received
a grievous shock...

641
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,000
That she has.

642
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,600
Shame on you,
sitting up there in that tree...

643
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,400
like a drunken Indian...

644
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,000
sucking on cigarettes
like a common...

645
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,400
- Floozy.
- Floozy!

646
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,000
Preacher lady...

647
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,600
don't you go calling
Miss Dolly and us no floozies.

648
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,400
I'll come down there
and slap you bowlegged!

649
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,600
You heard that, Sheriff?
That nigger threatened me!

650
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,200
Now, mind who
you call names, Thelma.

651
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,600
Nothing particularly
Christian about that.

652
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,400
Consider a moment,
Miss Buster...

653
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,600
and you will realize that
we are nearer God than you...

654
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,400
by several yards.

655
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,200
Good for you, Miss Dolly.
I call that a good answer.

656
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,000
Why did you come with us if
it wasn't to do the Lord's will?

657
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,400
Lord's will.

658
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,000
Maybe the Lord told those people
to go live in a tree.

659
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,600
He never told you
to drag them out.

660
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,800
Unless, of course,
Verena Talbo is the Lord.

661
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,800
A theory several of you folks
give credence to, hey, Sheriff?

662
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,200
The hell with this.

663
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,800
Look, let's not be having
any more trouble.

664
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,400
Come on down from there,
the pack of you.

665
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,200
Miss Dolly, you always been
a peaceful person.

666
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,800
Why don't you just come on down
and go home with us?

667
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,000
You don't want
to miss your dinner, do you?

668
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,600
It's too early for dinner.

669
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,200
Besides, we're not hungry.
Are you?

670
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,000
There's a drumstick up here
if anyone wants it.

671
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,600
You make it hard for me, ma'am.

672
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,200
- All right.
- Just a minute, Sheriff.

673
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,800
If he lays a hand on any of you,
just kick him in the head.

674
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Catherine,
now, you back up, Catherine.

675
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
You back off.

676
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,400
No! No!

677
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,600
Verena wants you home, Collin.

678
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
No!

679
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Are you all right?

680
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,600
Dolly Talbo, you come down from
that tree right this minute!

681
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,000
Beg pardon.

682
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
Oh, my God.
All right, that did it.

683
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,200
She... Dolly Talbo,
she attacked me!

684
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,400
Everyone here's a witness!

685
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,400
Junius, you arrest her!

686
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,800
If you weren't such an old man,
I'd knock you down.

687
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,400
Oh, I'm not so old, junior,
just old enough to know...

688
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,600
that men ought not fight
in front of ladies.

689
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,800
On the other hand,
I'm ready whenever you are.

690
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Nobody's going to accuse me
of hitting an old man.

691
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,600
Or standing up to one.

692
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,200
Go on.
Go feed your chickens.

693
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,000
Save yourselves
a lot of trouble...

694
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,800
and just get on down
from there.

695
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,200
Never mind.
They've had their chance.

696
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
You think you're getting away
with something...

697
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
but let me tell you,
there'll be retribution.

698
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,400
If not here in heaven,
right here on this earth!

699
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,000
Right here on earth!

700
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,200
You leading citizens
ought to behave themselves...

701
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,200
otherwise, the whole damn place
just falls apart!

702
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
You old fool.

703
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,600
Do I remember
you offering a drumstick...

704
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,600
to anybody would like it?

705
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,800
Fools in a tree,
they called us...

706
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,200
and very soon, other outcasts
would find their way...

707
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,800
into Dolly's special sanctuary.

708
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Ask me, honey,
I don't care who hit her.

709
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,200
They ought to get a medal. Yep.

710
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
Praise Jesus!

711
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,200
Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!
Praise Jesus!

712
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,800
Evangelists.

713
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,800
I saw them once
at a fair in Barnwell.

714
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Their mama...
Daddy's long gone by now...

715
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,800
she calls herself Sister Ida.

716
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,800
That little Homer, though,
he is as cute as a button.

717
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,400
Says they'll be here
tomorrow night.

718
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,800
Well, it's not like
we can't use a good revival.

719
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
Ask me, honey,
there hasn't exactly been...

720
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,600
a shortage of lost souls
around here lately.

721
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,200
Here. Read this.

722
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,800
"Soul Roundup," my foot.

723
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Woman's known throughout six
states as an infamous trollop.

724
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,600
Think of it. Fifteen children
and no sign of a husband.

725
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,200
Shameful.

726
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,800
Under no circumstances
will I allow that brood...

727
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,800
to interfere
with this congregation.

728
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,200
- Absolutely not.
- The nerve!

729
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,800
Boys,
going to need some deputies.

730
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,000
Got to round up
this tree house bunch...

731
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,600
and bring them in.
Any volunteers?

732
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
Riley Henderson...

733
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,000
come over here
and get yourself deputized, boy.

734
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,800
No, thanks.

735
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,400
You ought to get yourself
on the right side of the law...

736
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,000
every once in a while.

737
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,200
Gonna have to learn him
some respect.

738
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,200
All right. Anybody?
Anybody at all?

739
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,200
- Come on!
- Oh, Lord.

740
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,200
All right. Them that's in,
raise their right hands.

741
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,000
Your other right, Ray.

742
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,400
All right.
Now, swear after me...

743
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,000
They even said they was
gonna arrest you, Judge.

744
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Disturbing the peace
and obstructing justice.

745
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That's what I heard.

746
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,600
Nobody but That One to blame
for this here predicament...

747
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,400
her and that old funny-looking
Dr. Morris Ritz...

748
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,800
coming in there
trying to steal our medicine.

749
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Some way we failed her.

750
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
There was no place for us
in her house.

751
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,800
Maybe there's no place
for any of us...

752
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
except we know there is.

753
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,800
This could be
your place and mine.

754
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,400
Some more wine, Judge?

755
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,200
Oh, no, thank you, Miss Dolly.

756
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,000
I've had a sufficiency.

757
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,400
What you writing, Judge?

758
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,200
It's not nice to pry.

759
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,200
It's a letter to a girl...

760
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,800
not much younger than you,
Collin.

761
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
Her name is Heather Fall.

762
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Heather Fall?
Oh, what a lovely name.

763
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,200
Came across it in one of
those children's magazines...

764
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,200
that Amos' keeps
in the barber shop.

765
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
On the back cover...

766
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,200
they have the addresses
of children...

767
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,200
who want to correspond
with other children.

768
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,600
I sent her a picture postcard.
She answered at once.

769
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,000
Charming description...

770
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,600
of her father's
sheep ranch in Alaska.

771
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,800
That's very noble of you,
keeping company with her.

772
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,000
It must snow there so much.

773
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,200
I still have
the photograph she sent.

774
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,000
Hunted through
some old albums...

775
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,400
found a Kodak of myself
on a fishing trip...

776
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,200
when I was 15 years old...

777
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,200
out in the sun
with a trout in my hand.

778
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,800
Well, I wrote her back...

779
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,400
as though I was
still that 15-year-old boy.

780
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,000
I told her about the gun
I got for Christmas...

781
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,200
and how the dog had pups.

782
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,200
It was fun for
an old man sitting alone...

783
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,200
listening to
the noise of a clock...

784
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,400
to be growing up again
with a sweetheart in Alaska.

785
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,000
Two years ago,
I wrote her and told her...

786
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,600
I was going to law school.
She sent me this.

787
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,000
A gold nugget.

788
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,200
It would bring me luck,
she said.

789
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,000
My son, the banker...

790
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,200
he doesn't
approve of any of this.

791
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,200
He thinks I... A sign of...

792
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,200
Well, I ain't
no good with women.

793
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,800
Yeah, well, me neither.

794
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,200
If you ask me, son...

795
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,200
you're going at it
the wrong end first.

796
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,800
You got to start small.

797
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,800
First you got to learn
to love a leaf.

798
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,000
Then the rain.

799
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,200
Then some day,
if you're lucky...

800
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,800
the right person.

801
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Judge...

802
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,800
I got me a bowl of goldfish...

803
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,800
but just because I like them,
don't make me love the world.

804
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
Love ain't nothin'
but a whole lot of mess.

805
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,400
Could take a lifetime.

806
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,200
It's taken me that long.

807
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,600
Only thing I know is
love is a chain of love...

808
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,800
same as
nature's a chain of life.

809
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,200
Ow! What's that for?

810
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,000
That's for snatching my teeth.

811
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,600
Dolly.

812
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,600
All these years,
and I've never known you.

813
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,000
Never known anybody.

814
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,400
Never known the one person
in the world...

815
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,400
from whom nothing is held back.

816
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,400
My wife Irene
was a remarkable woman.

817
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,400
I shared everything with her.

818
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,600
At least I thought I did.

819
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,000
During the last
two years of her life...

820
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,600
when she was very sick,
I took her abroad...

821
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,000
to all the places
we'd been on our honeymoon.

822
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,600
Right before she died, she...

823
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,200
I said...

824
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,600
"Irene, are you happy?

825
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,200
Have I made you happy?"

826
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,200
"Happy, happy, happy."

827
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
It was one of her last words.

828
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,200
I never knew
whether she was saying yes...

829
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
or whether she was answering
with an echo.

830
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,800
I should know
if I'd ever known her.

831
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,200
I suppose I've been in love
all my life.

832
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Well, no, I've never loved
a gentleman.

833
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,600
You might say,
I never had the opportunity.

834
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,400
When I was a child...

835
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,600
I loved the color pink.

836
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,200
And the box I kept...

837
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,800
It's somewhere in the attic.

838
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,000
I must ask Verena
to please give it to me.

839
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,600
What's in there?

840
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,800
A dried honeycomb...

841
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,400
empty hornet's nest...

842
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,800
and a blue jay's egg.

843
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,600
My first loves.

844
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,600
All these years,
and I've never recognized you.

845
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Spirit of a pagan.

846
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,400
A pagan?

847
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,800
Well, spirit, then.

848
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,400
Spirits accept life...

849
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,200
grant its differences.

850
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,800
I think
spirits are silly things.

851
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,200
Ghostly.

852
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,400
So many times,
I passed your house...

853
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,000
and wanted to come in.

854
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,800
All it took, Charlie,
was a push on the doorbell.

855
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,200
Call Dr. Ritz.
Tell him I'm on my way up.

856
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,200
He checked out this morning...

857
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,200
told me to charge the bill
to Gypsy Queen Dropsy Cure.

858
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,800
They got an account
with us, ma'am?

859
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,000
Miss Talbo?

860
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,200
It took Walt Higgins
at the hotel...

861
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,400
nearly half an hour
to revive Verena.

862
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,600
People said Dr. Ritz
taking her money...

863
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,000
had knocked the gumption
clean out of her.

864
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That morning, our world, too,
changed forever.

865
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,600
The judge had bragged...

866
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,800
what a great hand
he was at frying catfish...

867
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,400
so Riley and I set out
to rustle one up for breakfast.

868
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,400
As it turned out,
that fish never got eaten.

869
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Jimbo, get her!

870
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,200
Hey, there's
another one of them.

871
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,800
Get the little bastard!

872
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,200
Leave my baby be! Stop!

873
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,400
Kick him in the booboos, baby!

874
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Yes! Now leave my baby be!

875
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Run, baby! You run!

876
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,800
Run!

877
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,000
Run!

878
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,600
Did you find
that old fool with Miss Dolly?

879
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,600
She's around here somewhere.

880
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Sheriff!

881
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,200
Yeah, over here.

882
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,200
You better go back into town.

883
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Verena's done pitched
a conniption.

884
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,600
That rich fella...

885
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Oh, what in the hell
does that woman want now?

886
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,000
Want a army?

887
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Move over, Ralph.
Come on. Move over.

888
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Come on.

889
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,600
Ain't it just terrible?

890
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
That is how it turns out...

891
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,600
when you leave your money
lying around, honey.

892
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,800
Verena Talbo of all people?

893
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,200
And here we thought that
she trotted down to the bank...

894
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,800
with every dime
that came her way.

895
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,400
$12,700! Oh!

896
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,800
Lordy Lord.

897
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,600
As for him...

898
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,800
they have not located
hide nor hair.

899
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,400
South America,
that's where they'll find him...

900
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,800
if and when.

901
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,600
I was never one to insinuate
there was any monkeyshines...

902
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,800
went on between her and
that so-called Dr. Morris Ritz.

903
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,600
Honey, that man had
the worst case of dandruff...

904
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,200
I ever saw
on any human head. Oh!

905
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,800
It was my fault.

906
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,800
If Catherine hadn't gone
to look for me...

907
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
they never
would have caught her.

908
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,200
Dolly couldn't believe
her friend...

909
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,000
had been taken from her.

910
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
The judge
thought he'd failed us.

911
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,800
It set a poor example
for the town, people said...

912
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,400
the Talbo sisters quarreling...

913
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,400
and Catherine being dragged off
to the colored jail.

914
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,600
They wanted us home
where we belonged.

915
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,200
But before the sheriff
could come back for us...

916
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,400
a whole new scandal
had arrived...

917
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,600
and her name was Sister Ida.

918
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,600
Revivals had always
been popular in our town...

919
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
but no one
had ever seen anything...

920
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,600
like Sister Ida's Soul Roundup.

921
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,400
Some called it
the devil's work.

922
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Who will come together
in the sweet by and by?

923
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,400
Them that wash away their sins
by givin' to mankind

924
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,400
Only the selfish will be
left out high and dry

925
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,400
Come time
for bringin' in the fold

926
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,200
From God's clothesline

927
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,400
Pin up your troubles
on God's clothesline

928
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,800
Amen!

929
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Leave all your worries
and your sins behind

930
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,400
Praise Jesus!

931
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:08,000
Your soul was dirty,
but it cleans up fine

932
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,800
So pin up your troubles
on God's clothesline

933
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,400
But you can't pin up a nickel

934
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,800
You can't hang up a dime

935
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,800
No penny-pinchin' miser

936
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,600
Will see the next lifetime

937
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,000
We can make a string of dollars

938
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,400
Look at them.
Fleecing the flock!

939
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,200
The laundry will get...

940
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,600
I know one person
who will put a stop to this.

941
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,200
Hang up your troubles

942
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,200
We've seen enough.

943
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,200
Hello.

944
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Verena, Reverend Buster.

945
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,000
That hussy of a revivalist
is denouncing you...

946
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,200
as right now an enemy of Jesus.

947
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,400
Cast out your own sister,
she says.

948
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,600
What?

949
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,200
Joshua fought
the battle of Jericho

950
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,400
Jericho, Jericho

951
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,000
Joshua fought
the battle of Jericho

952
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,000
When the walls
came a-tumblin' down

953
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Then the mighty horns
began to blow

954
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,600
Go do your duty, Sheriff.

955
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,400
Joshua fought
the battle of Jericho

956
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Jericho, Jericho

957
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,600
Joshua fought
the battle of Jericho

958
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,600
When the walls
came a-tumblin' down

959
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,000
Ma'am, you can't go around...

960
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,800
bad-mouthing
our leading citizens.

961
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,600
Now, Dolly and Verena Talbo
are fine, upstanding women.

962
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,000
Even if one of them
is living in a tree.

963
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,800
- Eddie!
- What?

964
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,000
Hey! Hey, who put this up!

965
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,200
That thief there? Hey, look!

966
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Look at him.
He's taking our money.

967
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,000
Ma'am, you got
till sunrise tomorrow...

968
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
to pack up that wagon,
load up these brats...

969
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,600
and get the hell out of here.

970
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,200
Hey, get that rope in quick!

971
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,600
This is the Lord's money.

972
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
I'm confiscating it
in his behalf.

973
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,800
This revival's over.

974
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,200
Go do it now.

975
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,600
Everybody go...

976
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,600
Jack, Ray, what in the hell
are y'all doing in here?

977
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,600
Help me get these people
out of here.

978
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,000
- Come on, folks!
- Pull!

979
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,400
Whore of Babylon, repent!

980
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,400
- Daddy!
- And your shame shall be saved.

981
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,200
I'm not your daddy!
Get away from me!

982
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,600
Janus.

983
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,800
You all right, Reverend?

984
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,600
Hey! That is our money.

985
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,400
Reverend Buster,
what are you doing?

986
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,600
That was freely offered
by these good people...

987
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,600
from the bounty of their hearts.

988
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,200
Just call that money a fine, OK?

989
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,800
Now, come on. Get up here.

990
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,400
Just be glad
we're letting you go.

991
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,600
Wait! Wait!

992
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,600
Get her out of here.

993
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Let go of me, you big apes!
Let go!

994
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,400
Give me that!

995
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,600
Why can't the judge get
his own coffee?

996
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,000
It's not likely...

997
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,400
with the sheriff
out looking for him.

998
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,800
Besides, maybe he wants
a little time...

999
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,200
to get better acquainted
with Miss Dolly.

1000
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,600
Jealous.

1001
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
No way. I'm not jealous.

1002
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Sounds like it to me.

1003
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,800
Hey, wait up. Wait up.

1004
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,800
Your folks?

1005
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,800
Yeah.

1006
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,800
I miss them.

1007
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,800
Strange.

1008
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,800
Yeah.

1009
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,400
I'm glad your ma was nice.

1010
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
My old lady used to make me
hop around on one leg...

1011
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,800
reciting
the multiplication tables.

1012
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,400
Caught her one day trying
to drown my sister in the tub.

1013
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,000
I had to break
the door down with an ax.

1014
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,600
They came and took her away.

1015
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,200
Never had much use
for folks after that.

1016
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,000
Come on.

1017
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,800
Morning, fellas.
I'd appreciate a few directions.

1018
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,800
What the hell?

1019
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,600
They told me
that out this way...

1020
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,600
I'd find a Miss Talbo,
Miss Dolly Talbo, they said.

1021
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,200
Living in a tree, they said.

1022
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,200
Oh, are these all yours?

1023
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,600
Yep. Sure are. All mine.

1024
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,200
Could you help me out
with a cigarette?

1025
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,800
Sure.

1026
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,800
We just can't go much further.

1027
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,400
Just don't have the gas.

1028
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,400
You're wasting your time.

1029
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,600
There's nobody there anymore.

1030
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Not in the tree?

1031
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,200
Where will we find her, then?

1032
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,000
Don't ask me.

1033
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,400
Oh, shoot!

1034
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,800
You could have at least
found out what they wanted.

1035
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,800
Nah. A loose woman like that...

1036
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,000
is no one to associate
with Miss Dolly.

1037
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
You look very radiant
this morning, Miss Dolly.

1038
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,200
For the first time in my life,
I'm doing what I want to do.

1039
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,200
Makes the whole world
seem so beautiful...

1040
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,800
so alive with choices.

1041
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,600
When I started
with the sheriff's party...

1042
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,400
I was a man convinced...

1043
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,400
that his life will have passed
without a trace.

1044
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,400
Now I think I will not have been
so unfortunate.

1045
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Oh, of course not.

1046
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,800
I have some means,
not a great deal...

1047
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,800
but enough to take care of us.
All of us.

1048
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,000
You and Catherine...

1049
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,400
and Collin till he's grown.

1050
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,800
Why, Charlie!

1051
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,800
I know it must seem abrupt...

1052
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,800
but it's been in my mind
for a long, long time.

1053
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,600
It would be the crowning
achievement of my life.

1054
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,200
You really are...

1055
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,600
aren't you...

1056
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,200
asking me to...

1057
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,200
To be the one person
in the world.

1058
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,200
Can you imagine the gossip?

1059
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,800
People will be talking
for months.

1060
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Look, I'm all fluttery...

1061
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,000
just at the thought of it.

1062
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,800
Could I be?

1063
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,600
It's for you to decide.

1064
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,000
I'd say yes right now.

1065
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,600
I'd jump up
and tell the whole world...

1066
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,600
Yes!

1067
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,000
Yes, yes.

1068
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But I can't, Charlie.

1069
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,600
Not until I've made my peace
with Verena.

1070
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,600
She'll never let you do that,
Miss Dolly...

1071
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,400
except on her terms.

1072
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,400
She'd just try to pull you
right back into the prison.

1073
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,000
Not if you don't let her,
Charlie.

1074
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,400
Don't let me.

1075
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,800
It's not too late.

1076
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,200
Just in time.

1077
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
Eddie,
round up the other deputies.

1078
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,800
Sober them up if you have to
and meet me over at Verena's.

1079
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,800
We got to get
this tree house thing settled.

1080
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
- Yes, sir.
- OK.

1081
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,600
I miss my kitchen.

1082
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,200
Remember how warm it used to be
on cold winter mornings?

1083
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
Our special place.

1084
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,600
Yours, mine,
and poor Catherine.

1085
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,600
You didn't see her.

1086
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,800
Suppose we let them
have their way...

1087
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,200
gave up, that is.

1088
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,400
They'd have to let her go,
wouldn't they?

1089
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,800
But if I did that...

1090
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,800
I'd be doing what
other people want me to do...

1091
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,200
same as I have
ever since I was a little girl.

1092
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,000
And the judge... Charlie...

1093
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,400
it would disappoint him so.

1094
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,400
He's very dear to me, you know.

1095
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,000
This morning,
while you were away...

1096
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,400
he asked me to marry him.

1097
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,000
Collin, you take care
of Miss Dolly, now, hear?

1098
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,400
So you're going to go away...

1099
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,600
leave us... leave me?

1100
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,000
Oh, you know
I would never leave you.

1101
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,400
You and Catherine
would come with us.

1102
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,400
Don't be unhappy.

1103
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,000
Let's try something.

1104
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,400
You and I are going
for a little walk.

1105
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Y'all take this bar of soap...

1106
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,200
and you go down to the river
and you wash yourselves.

1107
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,400
If I can wash myself,
you can wash yourselves.

1108
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:00,400
No, you're dirty!
You are dirty!

1109
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,400
No! I hate bathing!

1110
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,200
I do believe
you're sitting on my father.

1111
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,400
- Oh, sorry, soldier.
- Oh, please don't.

1112
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,200
I only meant
to introduce myself.

1113
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,800
I understand
you're looking for me.

1114
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,200
I'm Dolly Talbo.

1115
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,800
Praise Jesus.

1116
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,600
You're the answer
to our prayers.

1117
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:37,400
We never said a word
against you or your sister.

1118
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,600
I ought to have them arrested...

1119
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,600
that puke-faced Buster
and that sheriff.

1120
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,400
He thinks he's King Kong.

1121
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,000
They cleaned us out.
They took our love offerings.

1122
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,000
I have 15 mouths to feed...

1123
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
less than half a gallon of gas,
and 90 cents to our name.

1124
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That won't even get us
to the next town...

1125
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,800
for the revival meeting.

1126
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,400
I have a friend.

1127
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,400
A brilliant man.
He'll know an answer.

1128
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,400
Collin, you scoot on ahead
and let the judge know...

1129
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,000
to expect company for dinner.

1130
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,400
All right.

1131
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,200
- Thank you.
- Please, don't worry.

1132
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,000
Judge!

1133
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Dolly invited
16 more people to dinner.

1134
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,800
Sixteen people? Lordy Lord.

1135
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,600
Fetch some more water.

1136
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,200
Fetch some more water.

1137
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,400
See if you can scrounge up
some fixings.

1138
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,600
Yes, sir.

1139
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
See if you can get
some squirrel.

1140
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,400
Want a cigarette?

1141
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,200
I've just started.

1142
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,000
I do hope
it's not habit-forming.

1143
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Well, just never get my habit.

1144
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,400
Having kids. Ha ha!

1145
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,800
That's Danny, my oldest.

1146
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,200
His father, Dan Rainey,
was my first love.

1147
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,000
Where is your husband?

1148
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,400
Oh, not my husband.

1149
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,000
He's still married
to my sister Geraldine.

1150
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,800
I never told him Danny was his.

1151
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:18,600
I've spent years looking
for another Dan Rainey.

1152
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,200
One of the miners
up in Stonyville...

1153
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,400
he had the same freckles...

1154
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,600
the same yellow eyes.

1155
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,600
He obliged me with Sam,
my next oldest.

1156
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,800
What is it like,
the love of a man?

1157
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,800
Why, honey, it's anything
you choose to make it.

1158
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:47,000
For me, there is nothing like
the touch of a man's hand.

1159
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,600
It tells everything,
the touch... everything.

1160
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:57,200
The judge says love is a chain.

1161
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,600
Certainly is in my case.

1162
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,000
Just look at all them links.

1163
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,600
Ha ha ha!

1164
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,800
Never forget that.
Always remember that.

1165
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,600
How long have
you had the calling, dear?

1166
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,400
It was 15 years ago
last February 3.

1167
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,000
I didn't by any means
deserve to be chosen.

1168
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,200
It wasn't
until I met Mr. Honey...

1169
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,000
that I saw why
the Lord had chosen me.

1170
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
We had Roy, then Pearl,
then Kate and Cleo...

1171
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,600
and little Homer.
Most of them born in that wagon.

1172
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,800
I suppose Collin is as close
as I've come to having a baby.

1173
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,000
Little Ida,
Laura, and Texaco...

1174
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,200
All them other kids,
they just sort of happened.

1175
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,800
Seems somehow
I can't get along...

1176
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,200
without another life
kicking under my heart.

1177
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,600
Buck, you and Homer
chase up to that wagon.

1178
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,800
Gracious knows who's come along
and helped themselves.

1179
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,000
We've discussed your situation.

1180
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You'd win your case in court,
no question about it.

1181
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,800
For once the law would be
on the right side.

1182
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,200
As matters stand...

1183
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,000
Yes, please. Take that.

1184
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Here, take mine, too.
I'll keep a dollar.

1185
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,600
This is wrong...

1186
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,800
but I thank you.

1187
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,600
They're coming! They're coming!

1188
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,200
Who, the British?
Slow down. Who's coming?

1189
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:35,600
The sheriff! Stopped there
behind the grass with guns.

1190
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,600
All right, everybody,
keep your heads.

1191
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,000
Now, women and small children
up to the tree house.

1192
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,400
Riley, scatter
the rest of you out there.

1193
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,200
Shimmy up the other trees.
Grab a handful of rocks, hear?

1194
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,800
Fast as you can!

1195
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,200
Help your mama and
Miss Dolly get up this tree.

1196
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,600
Come on. Help each other.

1197
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,400
Help Miss Dolly.

1198
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,200
Been expecting you, Sheriff.

1199
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,400
Step aside, Judge.
This is for the law to handle.

1200
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,200
Get out of my way.

1201
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,200
You... Dolly.

1202
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Mind the poison ivy, sister.

1203
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,600
Am I to understand that you're
still conniving with that...

1204
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,600
that woman...

1205
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,000
after she made
a mockery of our name?

1206
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,200
I can't set much store
in a name...

1207
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,800
that steals
from little children...

1208
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,800
and drags women into jail.

1209
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,800
It ought to be a mockery.

1210
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,600
You're not yourself.

1211
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,600
You'd best look again.

1212
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,400
I am myself.

1213
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,400
Damn you, Charlie Cool!

1214
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,400
Talk some sense
into that sister of mine!

1215
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,600
What the hell is going on?

1216
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,600
Watch out, honey.

1217
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,200
All right, you people.
Go on home now.

1218
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,200
Go on home. You're going
to miss your supper.

1219
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,600
That's enough.
Someone's going to get hurt.

1220
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,600
Verena!

1221
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,000
Verena!

1222
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:45,600
Collin!

1223
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,800
Oh, my God.

1224
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,600
Oh, my God.

1225
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,400
Son? Oh, have mercy.

1226
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,400
Verena.

1227
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,200
Oh, have mercy.

1228
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,200
Have mercy. Oh, my boy.

1229
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:11,200
Here. Take the gold nugget.
Bring you luck.

1230
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,600
Which one of you fools
fired that gun?

1231
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,000
- It was an accident.
- He did it.

1232
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,600
I was bumped.

1233
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,400
I hold you personally
responsible, Mr. Stover.

1234
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,000
No one is responsible...

1235
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
except ourselves.

1236
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,000
Thank your lucky stars
it's only his shoulder.

1237
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,200
You're all right, son.

1238
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,800
You're all right.

1239
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,200
Take him back to the house.

1240
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,200
Yes ma'am.
Boys, come over here quickly.

1241
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,600
- Fetch Doc Carter.
- Yes, ma'am.

1242
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,400
He's going to be all right, now.
You just be careful with him.

1243
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,800
Watch your head.
Watch your back.

1244
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,600
- Easy, now. Watch your head.
- Careful.

1245
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,800
Careful. Just take him home.

1246
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,000
He's going to be all right.

1247
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,000
Where is Texaco?

1248
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,200
Come on.

1249
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,600
Y'all say your good-byes.
Laura can hold the baby.

1250
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,400
Everybody stay together.

1251
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,000
Well, he's got
a pretty bad concussion...

1252
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,400
and that shoulder's
going to smart him a mite...

1253
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,000
but he's going to be fine.

1254
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,600
Thank heaven.

1255
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,000
I'll stop in in a few days,
take a look at him.

1256
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,200
Judge, Miss Dolly.

1257
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Thank you.

1258
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,200
I have something to say
to my sister.

1259
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,800
I'm afraid you'll have
to put up with me, Miss Verena.

1260
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,800
I have an interest
in the outcome...

1261
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,800
of what you might have to say.

1262
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,800
I doubt that.

1263
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,800
Frankly, Charlie, you're not
a welcome sight to me.

1264
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,000
My sister couldn't have gone
through such tommyrot...

1265
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,400
if you hadn't been
goading her on.

1266
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,800
It'll be no further affair
of yours.

1267
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,000
But it is,
because Judge Cool...

1268
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,400
Charlie has...

1269
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,200
Dolly means that
I've asked her to marry me.

1270
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Well...

1271
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
that is... remarkable.

1272
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,400
Really.

1273
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,600
I wouldn't have credited
either one of you...

1274
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,400
with so much imagination.

1275
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,400
Quite likely I'm dreaming...

1276
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,800
except that I never have dreams.

1277
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,600
This one I suggest
we all forget.

1278
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,000
But a man who doesn't dream
is like a man who doesn't sweat.

1279
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,200
He stores up a lot of poison.

1280
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,400
You've accepted him,
have you?

1281
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,000
I've taken your advice.

1282
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Stopped hanging my head, I mean.

1283
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
You told me it made you dizzy.

1284
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,400
You told me you were
ashamed of me... of Catherine.

1285
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,400
So much of our lives
have been lived for you.

1286
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,200
It was painful to realize
the waste it had been.

1287
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:26,000
Can you know what that is,
such a feeling of waste?

1288
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,800
I do know.

1289
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Imagined
I'd go to my dying day...

1290
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,800
with the hurt of it.
I won't.

1291
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,000
But it's no satisfaction,
Verena, is it?

1292
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm ashamed of you, too.

1293
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,000
Dolly.

1294
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Dolly.

1295
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,600
I thought I would know
what was right.

1296
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,600
Do other people?

1297
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,000
I wanted to have a life
made up of my own decisions.

1298
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,200
But we've had our lives.

1299
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:23,800
Yours has been
nothing to despise.

1300
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,400
Leave decisions to me.

1301
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,000
That, you see, has been my life.

1302
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,600
Is that true, Charlie?

1303
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,000
Have we had our lives?

1304
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Some plants,
they bloom just the once...

1305
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,600
and nothing more
happens to them.

1306
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,600
They live,
but they've had their life.

1307
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Not you. Not me.

1308
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,400
I've always envied you, Dolly.

1309
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,600
Yes... envied you.

1310
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,400
Your rooms... your kitchen...

1311
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,400
I could only
knock at the door...

1312
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,200
and now there's no one
to let me in but you...

1313
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,800
because Morris... Help me.

1314
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,200
I loved him.

1315
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,600
I did.

1316
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh, I admit it, we were...

1317
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
we were kindred spirits.

1318
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We looked each other in the eye.

1319
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,400
We saw the same devil.

1320
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,800
We weren't afraid.

1321
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
He made me laugh.

1322
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,600
But he outsmarted me.

1323
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,600
I had known he could.

1324
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,800
Hoped he wouldn't,
but he did. And now...

1325
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,600
It's too long to live alone,
a lifetime.

1326
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,000
I walk through the house.
Nothing is mine.

1327
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Your pink rooms, your kitchen...

1328
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
The house is yours...

1329
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
and Catherine's, too, I think.

1330
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,600
Only don't leave me.

1331
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Let me live with you.

1332
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
I'm feeling old.

1333
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,000
I want my sister.

1334
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,200
Forgive me.

1335
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,600
I want my sister, too.

1336
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,800
The judge could not reach her...

1337
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,000
not with his arms...

1338
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,600
not with his heart.

1339
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,200
The sisters' bond was too final.

1340
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,400
The judge continued
to call on Dolly.

1341
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,400
She became
what he had wanted...

1342
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,400
the one person in the world
to whom everything can be said.

1343
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,600
Perhaps when everything
can be said...

1344
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,000
there's nothing more to say.

1345
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,800
It's good to have my baby back.

1346
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,800
No permanent damage.

1347
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,200
Going to be weak at first.

1348
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,800
Might itch awhile,
but that's only natural.

1349
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,000
Hi, Maude.

1350
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,600
Now, Collin, I do hope
that your costume is ready.

1351
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,200
Oh, Collin, you haven't
forgotten Halloween, have you?

1352
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
We've been working like dogs.

1353
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,400
There's going to be
wine punch...

1354
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,400
and I wouldn't be surprised...

1355
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,000
if there was drunkenness
and everything.

1356
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Riley's coming as the devil.

1357
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,600
Now, we want you there
in a skeleton costume.

1358
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,600
I know there isn't
much time left...

1359
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,400
I'm sure we can find
something for him.

1360
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,400
Thank you, Miss Talbo.

1361
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,000
I knew I could count on you.

1362
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,600
Please give my regards
to the judge.

1363
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,800
What about that ride you
promised me...

1364
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,000
Riley Henderson?

1365
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,200
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1366
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,800
Well, see y'all later.

1367
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,400
Bye-bye, Catherine.

1368
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,400
Bye, Collin.

1369
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,800
- Bye, Miss Talbo.
- Good-bye, Maude.

1370
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Easy. That's still
going to hurt you some.

1371
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Be careful, baby.

1372
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,800
Catherine, Halloween.

1373
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,600
Oh, what are we going to be?

1374
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,400
One in the morning...

1375
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,400
one before
he goes to bed at night.

1376
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,600
See,
Miss Dollyheart and me...

1377
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,600
we got our own cure.
Thank you very much.

1378
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,600
We'll feed this to a hog.

1379
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,200
Give me those pills.

1380
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,200
That One...

1381
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,800
In the spring,
we'll make a trip together.

1382
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,600
We could go
to the Grand Canyon...

1383
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,000
or Florida.

1384
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,400
You've never seen the ocean.

1385
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,800
I wouldn't enjoy it...

1386
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,000
seeing things I've known
shamed by nobler sights.

1387
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,800
I'm where I want to be.

1388
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
The woods are so beautiful
this time of year.

1389
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
We'll go tomorrow, Catherine.

1390
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,200
We must take our spades.

1391
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,000
I want to get
enough dropsy herbs...

1392
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
to see us through the winter.

1393
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Who gonna carry all that stuff?

1394
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,400
I told you, that jail done put
a permanent crick in my back.

1395
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,600
I done laid down the load.

1396
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,600
We could hire somebody.

1397
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,200
Or we could take in
another partner.

1398
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,200
I think, if he would accept...

1399
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,800
I think we should ask the judge.

1400
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,600
May I?

1401
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,400
May I come with you, too?

1402
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:29,600
I'd like to help...
if you'd let me.

1403
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,000
Oh, my.

1404
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,400
Thank you very much.

1405
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,400
Father, are you sure
you want to do this?

1406
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,400
Yes, sir.

1407
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,000
Father!

1408
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,000
Don't call me Father.

1409
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Oh, the judge is here.

1410
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,400
Let me help you
with your satchel.

1411
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,000
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Charlie.

1412
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Hello, ladies. Good to see you.

1413
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,400
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1414
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,600
Here you go, Dollyheart.

1415
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Oh, yes. This will make
some nice bloomers.

1416
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,400
A black satin collar...

1417
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,000
would dress up
my print considerably.

1418
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,200
I can use all this stuff.

1419
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:19,800
Catherine, dear, we mustn't
think of our own needs.

1420
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,200
Pity I didn't inherit
my father's hand at sewing.

1421
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,600
So many men sewed
in the old days.

1422
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,600
Did you know that, Collin?

1423
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,800
You know I was against
your coming here.

1424
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,000
Told Verena it wasn't right...

1425
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,400
raising a boy
in a house full of women...

1426
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,600
women and their prejudices.

1427
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,600
But I'm not worried
about that now.

1428
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,800
You'll make your mark.
You'll get on.

1429
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:07,200
There.
Let's see how it fits.

1430
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,800
I thought this was supposed
to be silver.

1431
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,400
It's better, isn't it?

1432
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,400
Gold... like a king's ransom.

1433
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,800
It tickles.

1434
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,000
I know, but I'm going
to make a mess...

1435
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
if you don't hold still.

1436
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,800
See what else I found?
My valuables.

1437
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,600
Look inside.

1438
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,400
Catherine stole them for me.

1439
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,200
I was too principled.

1440
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,000
It was my Christmas present.

1441
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,800
Charlie said
love is a chain of love.

1442
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,000
I hope you listened
and understood him...

1443
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
because...

1444
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,400
if you can love one thing...

1445
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,400
you can love another...

1446
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:14,000
and you can forgive everything.

1447
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
That's something to live by.

1448
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,200
I love you.

1449
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,400
I love you.

1450
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Well, I got to get you painted.

1451
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,600
I have so many friends now,
I'm going to give a party.

1452
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,600
Let's see,
there's Charlie and Riley...

1453
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,800
and we can ask Amos.

1454
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,600
Oh, dear.

1455
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,600
You see what I've done?

1456
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,000
You're trapped inside there
for a while.

1457
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
You're going to have to whirl.

1458
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Whirling will dry you.

1459
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,600
Dolly?

1460
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,000
Dolly?

1461
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,400
You OK? Huh?

1462
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:39,600
Help!

1463
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,000
Help!

1464
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,600
Get somebody!

1465
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,800
Dolly, please get up.

1466
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,000
Please.

1467
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Hush, now.

1468
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,600
It appears my...

1469
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,400
my sister has...

1470
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,200
suffered a stroke.

1471
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,600
She's left us.

1472
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,600
Collin.

1473
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,400
Miss Dolly.

1474
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,000
Love is a chain.

1475
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,600
Dolly?

1476
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,000
Love is a chain.

1477
01:35:55,400 --> 01:36:00,400
After Dolly died,
I was a long time dangling.

1478
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,400
Riley and Maude were married
the following fall.

1479
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,000
Riley's sister Elizabeth
was maid of honor...

1480
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,800
and I was Riley's best man.

1481
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,400
I've read that past and future
are a spiral...

1482
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:25,000
one coil containing the next
and predicting its theme.

1483
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,600
My own life, then, seemed to be
more a series of closed circles.

1484
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,000
- Bye!
- Bye!

1485
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
What weakened me was the wait
before I knew where to jump.

1486
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,600
If ever I was
going to make the leap...

1487
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,200
that was the time.

1488
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,000
Judge, can I get you
some of Miss Dolly's tea?

1489
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,000
I'd love some.
Thank you, Catherine.

1490
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,600
- OK.
- I'll help.

1491
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,200
All right, dear.

1492
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
Verena, I want to go away.

1493
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,200
I know. I do myself.

1494
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:09,000
I'd hoped to make
a trip with Dolly.

1495
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I wanted to show her the ocean.

1496
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,800
It could be a long trip.

1497
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,800
I've been thinking of selling
a few properties.

1498
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,800
We could take a boat.

1499
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,000
You've never seen the ocean.

1500
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,200
No.

1501
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,200
Well...

1502
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,200
What are your ambitions?

1503
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,400
Hey. Don't you come
back here baldheaded, honey.

1504
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:45,000
They'll try and scalp you
up there...

1505
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,600
cheat you every way they can.

1506
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,000
Here. Ha ha ha!

1507
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
- Bye, Amos.
- Bye-bye.

1508
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:58,600
Reverend.

1509
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,600
That city is an evil place.

1510
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:03,800
See you don't fall victim
to the wages of sin.

1511
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,400
- God bless you, boy.
- Bye.

1512
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:07,800
Good luck.

1513
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,600
Collin,
you stay out of trouble, now.

1514
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:13,000
Hear you're up to something...

1515
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,400
me and Ralph will come up there
and arrest you personally.

1516
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,600
- Say good-bye, Ralph.
- Bye, Ralph.

1517
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,200
You take care, son, all right?

1518
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,600
Go for a walk.

1519
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,000
Come on.

1520
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,200
We're going this way.
Come on. Come on.

1521
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,400
A writer is what
you're going to be, eh?

1522
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,800
Oh, yeah.

1523
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,400
You better write us a letter,
now, you hear?

1524
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,600
I will.

1525
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,000
Good luck.

1526
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,600
Look at you.
You're all ready to go.

1527
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,000
Miss Dolly would be proud.

1528
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Yeah, I know she would.

1529
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,600
You still got your lucky nugget?

1530
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,800
Yeah. Of course I do.

1531
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,400
You write to Elizabeth.
She's a good girl.

1532
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,400
And here's a diary for you.

1533
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,000
Write everything down
in there that you think of.

1534
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,400
Thank you.

1535
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,400
I want to show you something.

1536
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,000
Sure.

1537
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,600
So little, once it is changed,
changes back.

1538
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:58,000
Their memory fades
with each passing year.

1539
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,600
Yet the precious moments
we shared...

1540
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,200
that unforgettable autumn
of my youth...

1541
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,200
forever shaped my life
as a storyteller.

1542
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
I live with the sound...

1543
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,800
of a harp of voices
inside my head...

1544
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,000
telling a story.

1545
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,400
They are forever talking...

1546
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,400
and the voice...

1547
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,400
is Dolly's.

1548
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,600
The grass harp.

1549
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,200
When we're dead,
it will tell our stories, too.

1550
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,200
Am I your love or not?

1551
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,800
Please make it clear

1552
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:10,800
Why don't you tell me
what I long to hear?

1553
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:13,000
Goodness me

1554
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:19,400
Can't you see I'm up a tree?

1555
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:24,200
You've got me guessing

1556
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,400
And I hate to guess

1557
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,200
When will I understand

1558
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,000
True happiness?

1559
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,200
Honestly

1560
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:41,000
Can't you see I'm up a tree?

1561
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,600
What a chance I'm takin'

1562
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:48,400
'Cause how that tree is shakin'

1563
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:54,000
And I'm hanging out on a limb

1564
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:59,400
Looks like my chances are slim

1565
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,000
Got no way of knowin'

1566
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,200
How the wind is blowin'

1567
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,000
You put me in suspense

1568
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,800
And keep me there

1569
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,600
I'm losin' confidence

1570
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,600
In this affair

1571
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,800
Pity me

1572
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,400
Can't you see I'm up a tree?

1573
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,400
What a chance I'm takin'

1574
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,200
'Cause how that tree is shakin'

1575
01:45:54,400 --> 01:46:00,000
And I'm hanging out on a limb

1576
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,200
Looks like my chances are slim

1577
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,800
Got no way of knowin'

1578
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:11,000
How the wind is blowin'

1579
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,000
You put me in suspense

1580
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,800
And keep me there

1581
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,400
I'm losin' confidence

1582
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,600
In this affair

1583
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,600
Pity me

1584
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:29,400
Can't you see I'm up a tree?

1585
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:38,200
I'm just a fool to love you so

1586
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:43,000
What is your answer, yes or no?

1587
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Can't you see I'm up a tree?
