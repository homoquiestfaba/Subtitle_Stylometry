00:15:07,196 --> 00:15:09,475
Is that it?
Yeah.
[pig grunting]

176
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:11,685
Please tell me
we're not taking that.

177
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,312
What? This?

178
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:16,695
Aww, this is Dorothy.
Oh, hi, baby girl.

179
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:19,156
Say hi!
[pig grunting]

180
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,413
Hi. Oh, I love you.

181
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:30,454
[Rick]
We're going to have
to drive all night.

182
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:31,997
[Michelle]
You're mad, aren't you?

183
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:35,584
Look, I'm not exactly sure
what happened last night,

184
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,211
but I have to be back
in Miami in 92 hours

185
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,671
to take the Bar Exam.

186
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,387
My career-- my entire life

187
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:43,842
hangs in the balance.

188
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:48,560
We are driving
2514.5 miles.

189
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,599
Now, at an average
of 50 miles per hour,

190
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,435
that's 50 hours and 14
minutes driving time.

191
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,730
We have contingency hours
scheduled, for gas and
emergencies,

192
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,398
but thanks to you
and your friends,

193
00:15:58,408 --> 00:15:59,524
some of those are gone now.

194
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,865
How about laughing, huh?

195
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,570
Do we have any time
scheduled for laughing?

196
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,065
I just wanna know just
so I don't miss it.

197
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,624
Where are you from?

198
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,537
Wichita, Kansas.

199
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:13,830
Does your family still
live there?

200
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,415
Yeah.

201
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:18,251
We should stop by and say hi.
It's totally on the way.

202
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:22,088
It's not even remotely
on the way, so let's just
concentrate on the trip.

203
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,215
I can see why
my uncle picked you.

204
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,216
Really?

205
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:26,217
Mmm-hmm.

206
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,522
You make a great
babysitter.

207
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,899
[Michelle]
I'll drive the next shift.

208
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:42,734
[Rick]
You're not on the insurance.

209
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:45,069
I'm driving straight through.
[Michelle] Not possible.

210
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,947
And no drinks.
I'm not stopping
for you to go again.

211
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:50,617
So he gives me this look in
the eye like he's gonna race me.

212
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,577
Like he's gonna take me
in my Camaro.

213
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:54,621
He's got a Sunfire.
What's that gonna do to me?

214
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,039
You know what I'm saying?

215
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:00,084
So I told him I...I said...
I said..
[pig grunting]

216
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:02,094
Oh man.

217
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:05,181
You see her?

218
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,562
[dog growling]

219
00:17:11,272 --> 00:17:13,473
Gas and whatever she's got.

220
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,308
Well, what she got?

221
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,851
I dunno.

222
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,275
Well, y'all
wanna buy a mug?

223
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,313
No.
Are you sure?

224
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:22,023
You can hold a
lot more than Coke in this.

225
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:23,816
You can hold crawdads, whatever
you want.
Yes, I'm sure.

226
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,485
They're real good mugs y'know,
and you buy one of these you get

227
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:30,411
free refills on every
Tuesday and Friday.

228
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:34,535
Heck, before you say no,
I wanna let you know
I've had my mug for five years.

229
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:36,589
So durable.

230
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,708
You made me wreck
my mug.

231
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:43,507
[laughing]
We want the mug.

232
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,796
You want a mug?
I want the mug.

233
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,674
Oh great. Well,
you're real nice, lady.

234
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,302
Watcha doin' hanging out
with this Clark Kent,

235
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:54,346
when you could be
with a real Superman?

236
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,347
Just kidding you, boy!

237
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:58,856
My God, you see
his eyes? Dang.

238
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:00,394
Could I have my mug?

239
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:04,320
Oh yeah, hold on.
You want your change?
Nah.

240
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,733
For the kids.

241
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:06,734
For the kids.

242
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,901
Here you go, sweetheart.

243
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,778
Fill 'er up.
Thank you, my love.

244
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,119
You owe me for my mug.

245
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,124
That's $3.99.

246
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:22,236
And I'm giving this
change to the kids.

247
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,097
<i># [Country Western]</i>

248
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,221
[farts]

249
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,312
Oh, Dorothy!

250
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:40,317
Nice try, Michelle.

251
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,817
So why Los Angeles?
Why you going there?

252
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,827
I'm an actor.

253
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:55,370
Doesn't L.A. have
enough waitresses?

254
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,077
No, they called while
you were asleep and said
they needed one more.

255
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:03,167
Oh, oh wait, doesn't Miami
have enough copy boys?

256
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,506
I have to pee.

257
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:10,755
Okay, well, we got a stop
planned in about two hours.

258
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:13,008
Uh-uh. I can't wait that long.
I have to pee now.

259
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,348
Do the kegel thing.

260
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:18,268
What? I am poisoning myself.

261
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:19,764
Right now.
This is very--

262
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:21,774
You know, forget it.

263
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,146
What are you doing?
I gotta pee.

264
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:29,471
[tires squealing]
No, no, no, no! Uh-uh.

265
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:44,269
[horn honking]
Time's up. Let's go!

266
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,221
Okay. Ugh. Ugh!

267
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,798
Is that it?

268
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,717
Yeah, I peed.

269
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,229
Close the door.
Oh.

270
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,272

00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,146

272
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:09,981
Come on, come on. No!

273
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,447
Hi, Margery, it's Rick.

274
00:20:12,457 --> 00:20:14,277
The truck broke.

275
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,367
I think it's the engine.

276
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:19,579
I'm not really a car guy.

277
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,253
Call back if you get this.

278
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,725
I'm going this way.

279
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,265
I'll bet someone comes
in like five minutes.

280
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:45,516
I doubt it.

281
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:47,518
You're not going
to be here.

282
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:52,798
Then you'll have to
tell my uncle you left
me behind, won't you?

283
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,318
This is ridiculous.

284
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:58,654
These are the kind of
woods men are raped in.

285
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:02,079
[phone rings]

286
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:03,075
You okay?

287
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,660
Hello?

288
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,495
Yeah.
Wait, is that the car lady?

289
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:08,330
It's Carl.
Who's Carl?

290
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,379
He's my fat friend.

291
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:13,794
<i>Hey buddy, I was just wondering
if you wanted to come over
and watch  Family Ties.</i>

292
00:21:13,804 --> 00:21:16,380
Carl, I'm in the
middle of the forest.

293
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,382
When are you
going to be done?

294
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,175
I'm moving McAllister's
niece, remember?

295
00:21:20,185 --> 00:21:21,927
L.A.?

296
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,971
<i>What? I thought I told
you not to do that.</i>

297
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,180
You talked me into it.

298
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,349
No, no, buddy, I wouldn't
have told you that.

299
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,435
You said it was
a good career move.

300
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,771
Now come on over here
and have a grilled cheese.

301
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:34,565
I'm in a different state.

302
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:35,983
<i>[Michelle]
Carl, help!</i>

303
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,526
Is that her?

304
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:38,735
Yeah.
Yeah, what?

305
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:40,153
Is she hot?

306
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:41,864
I gotta go.

307
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:44,408
Okay, Rick, if she's hot,
say you're tired.

308
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:46,243
If she's not, say
it's hot outside.

309
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,828
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you talking about me?

310
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:50,956
<i>Wait, no no. If she's hot,
say it's hot outside.</i>

311
00:21:50,966 --> 00:21:52,708
If she's not...
I'm hanging up.

312
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:54,501
Did you give it to her?

313
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,003
What did he say?

314
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:58,013
He said hi.

315
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,971
Oh, this is so spooky.

316
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:03,677
Do you have to go
all the way to L.A.?

317
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:05,178
Can't I drop you
somewhere closer?

318
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,188
Like here?

319
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:17,404
Oh, look, civilization.

320
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:20,615
Maybe we should
go back and hitch.

321
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,362
Shouldn't we try
to get it fixed first?

322
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,739
What makes you think these
people can fix anything?

323
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:27,742
Well, if they can't, then
we'll go back and hitch.

324
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:29,244
Here.
[pig squealing]

325
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,996
What if we end up
buried in the forest?

326
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:33,581
Oh, what are
the chances of that?

327
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,417
Don't move or
I'll kill you!

328

329
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,467
[screams]
You like that?

330
00:22:39,477 --> 00:22:42,720
Huh? Huh?

331
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,760
Tomek! You put down
that knife right now!

332
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,770
Here, take the baby.

333
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:51,391
I said, put down the knife.

334
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,978
I was only kidding.
I'm only gonna kid you-- git!

335
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,988
Git!

336
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,239
[baby crying]

337
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,653
It's alright, baby.
You're just in time for dinner.

338
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:07,233
Nice pig. Come on.
Come on, bring the baby.

339
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,410
Watch out for my laundry.
It's getting dry.

340
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,500
[Flies buzzing]

341
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,997
We got us an antenna
over there.

342
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,874
Picks up all kinds of shows.

343
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,794
<i>You know that I missed
Days of Our Lives
for a year-and-a-half?</i>

344
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:22,046
Marlena was a-killin'
everybody.

345
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,714
But then I found out
it was all make-believe.

346
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:26,175
I can't tell you

00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,396
He's just upset
because he's chosen
a life of moral bankruptcy

526
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,732
and a succession
of loveless marriages.

527
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:49,822
Really?
Yeah.

528
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:50,818
That's terrible.

529
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:52,028
You know what?

530
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:53,279
The fact is, that
I've achieved everything

531
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,906
I've set out
to do in my life.

532
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,163
That bothers people.

533
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:58,826
Who wants to play
the alphabet game?

534
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:01,167
[gasps]
I do.

535
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:03,878
You guys go ahead.

536
00:33:03,888 --> 00:33:09,258
Okay...A.

537
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:11,844
<i>Ah, a tree.</i>

538
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:13,591
Good one.
Thank you.

539
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:15,342
Okay...B.

540
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:17,352
B.

541
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,566
Big sign.

542
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,394
Double high five.

543
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:26,395
Okay.

544
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,313
Okay...C.

545
00:33:27,323 --> 00:33:29,320
C, c--

546
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,608
[gasps]
Oh, I know.

547
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,823
<i>Can we get
some food?</i>

548
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,548
[Orlie]
Yeah, that
was a good one.

549
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:39,325
Can you get me a veggie
burger and some fries.

550
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:40,409
[gasps]

551
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,077
Ooh, and a cherry
caramel milkshake.

552
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,537
Thank you.

553
00:33:43,547 --> 00:33:46,545
Wow, that sounds
really delicious.

554
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:48,500
This is embarrassing,

555
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,593
but I'm a little
short on cash.

556
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:54,381
I did save your life, man.

557
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:56,008
Fine.

558
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,823
Hundredfold, brother.
Hundredfold.

559
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,308
Will you stop hitting me,
please?

560
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,059
You know, you and Michelle
make a great couple.

561
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,185
We're not dating.

562
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:10,340
Good, 'cause I think
she's digging me.

563
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,274
Hey, let's see what
kind of loot she's got.

564
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,284
No.

565
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,280
Don't hit people
in restaurants!

566
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,406
Especially--

567
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:20,699
It's a toy, man!
What's your problem?

568
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,409
Yeah, it's a toy.

569
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,535
Get over it.

570
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:26,877
You have exactly
five seconds to apol--

571
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:29,583
Why would you even do that
to a cute, little Mexican kid.

572
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:31,798
He's Japanese.

573
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,337
You can't just pick
where you're from.

574
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:35,881
Okay, stop talking.

575
00:34:35,891 --> 00:34:38,696
[Kid]
My dad's gonna
kick your ass!

576
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:41,428
Dream on, kid.

577
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:44,723
<i>Okay? He took you and
he can take your padré.</i>

578
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,558
Is that so?

579
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,568
No, it's--

580
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:51,529
Let's go then.

581
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:58,167
Scram, it's not
your business.

582
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:03,536
[Orlie]
He was pretty tough
for a little guy, huh?

583
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,539
[Michelle]
So, Orlie,
where are you from?

584
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:12,208
My physical being
hails from Boston.

585
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,683
[Michelle]
And your spiritual?

586
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,008
I'm what they classify
as a schismatic psyche.

587
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:22,218
In lay terms
that's renegade soul.

588
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,428
No way.

589
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:24,929
Yeah.

590
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,681
See, what happened is,

591
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,474
when my original body died,

592
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:29,684
the spirit got all freaky

593
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,935
and crossed paths
with someone else's.

594
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:34,188
Now they have my body
and I have theirs.

595
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,732
Happens quite
often actually.

596
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,691
That's crazy.

597
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,276
Yeah.

598
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:40,903
Spent the last four years
of my life looking for
a 25-year-old Walapai

599
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:45,078
who doesn't really fit
in with the native culture.

600
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,785
You're Indian.

601
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,328
That totally makes sense.

602
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:50,455
Native American.

603
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:51,956
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:51,966 --> 00:35:52,999
Isn't that amazing?

605
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,009
Unbelievable.

606
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:58,880
[Orlie]
What's your story?

607
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,007
You don't seem
much of a lawyer.

608
00:36:01,017 --> 00:36:02,842
That's what
I've been saying.

609
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,011
You should take
a personality test.

610
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,554
I'll bet you're yellow.

611
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,894
No, no, he's blue.

612
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:11,193
Give me your palm.

613
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,359
Wow, check out
his lifeline.

614
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:17,364
What?

615
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,066
What's the point?

616
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,068
Well, it shows you where you've
been and where you're going

617
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,070
and without that,
you're nothing.

618
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,321
Like navel lint.

619
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:25,781
Nobody knows where
that comes from.

620
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,366
It comes from clothes.

621
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:28,492
That's not the point.

622
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:29,994
It might.
[Rick]
It does.

623
00:36:30,004 --> 00:36:31,537
You know that
for a fact?

624
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:33,919
Yeah.
A hundred percent?

625
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,916
I'm pretty sure.
A hundred percent?

626
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:37,543
Okay, not
a hundred percent,

627
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:38,502
but 99.9--

628
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:39,795
See?

629
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,547
[Rick]
See what?
You're not always right!

630
00:36:41,557 --> 00:36:42,590
Here.

631
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,727
Make a wish.

632
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,181
Okay, I hate to beat
this to death

633
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:52,850
because I hate complainers

634
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,810
and I understand that
if we stop again,

635
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,981
the meal might once again
be interrupted by strange
circumstances,

636
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:03,699
but I for one am willing
to take that chance.

637
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,034
Oh, please, Rick?
Please?

638
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:08,162
But we're--
we can't stop!

639
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:10,252
You owe me a Reuben!

640
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,998
Please, please.
I feel bad,
I do,

641
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:18,213
but we're--

642
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:19,710
What's he doing?

643
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,711
Orlie!

644
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:22,004
You're killing him!

645
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:23,422
Orlie!
He's gonna die!

646
00:37:23,432 --> 00:37:25,557
[Rick]
We're not stopping!

647
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:27,175
Every minute we spend here

648
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,990
is a minute not spent
on the road.

649
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:34,474
Rick, that is a spiffy
watch you got there.

650
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:36,609
Can I see
it for a minute?

651
00:37:45,328 --> 00:37:48,530
I'll get a better one when
your uncle gives me a job.

652
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,662
Oops.

653
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:52,998
She put it in her boobs.

654
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:55,328
Shelly says you live
on the way.

655
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:56,538
Are we stopping?

656
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,712
No.

657
00:37:58,722 --> 00:38:00,458
Can you please wipe
that off and give it back?

658
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:03,044
I'll give it back to you when
you don't need it anymore.

659
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,087
You visit often?

660
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,422
Not lately.

661
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:06,756
Do you have
a girlfriend?

662
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:07,757
Huh! No.

663
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:08,842
He's keeping himself
available

664
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:14,310
for McAllister, Morganstern
and Raphael.

665
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,315
What about her?

666
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,935
She's working.

667
00:38:18,945 --> 00:38:21,860
You could totally
date her.

668
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:25,010
She probably thinks
I'm with Michelle.

669
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,073
[Orlie]
Taken care of.

670
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:33,783
I dare you.

671
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:37,108
I double dog dare
you to go talk to her.

672
00:38:38,297 --> 00:38:41,546
Fine.

673
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:43,551
Watch this.

674
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,391
Hello-- Ahem.
Hello.

675
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:57,228
I'm not with her,
I'm single, alone.

676
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:59,475
I just wanted to say hi,
that's all.

677
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:02,608
Oh...well, hi.

678
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:04,613
[Rick]
Hello.

679
00:39:27,012 --> 00:39:29,477
You know,
I have to go tinkle.

680
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:36,308
Yeah, I think
I'm just gonna go

681
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:38,399
look for some stuff.

682
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:57,668
<i># I called out your name #</i>

683
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:08,507
<i># In a mystic dream
last night #</i>

684
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:11,181
Don't force it.
Just relax.

685
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,351
Here.

686
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:23,850
Want a scrub down?

687
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
No, thanks.

688
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:32,567
Can I get a small favor?

689
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:35,977
I'm-- I'm a little
favored out right now.

690
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,435
Shelly's right,
you are a "no" person.

691
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,546
Okay, what is it?

692
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,958
Can't reach it.

693
00:40:47,968 --> 00:40:49,000
Rubs real hard.

694
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,299
[gags]

695
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,755
Maybe you should get
Michelle to do that.

696
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,715
No way!

697
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:56,716
Have you ever had a bimple?

698
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:57,717
A what?

699
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:58,718
A back pimple.

700
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:00,053
Or a butt pimple.

701
00:41:00,063 --> 00:41:01,930
I already taken care
of those this morning.

702
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,521
Yeah, I have, but--

703
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,517
Well, girls
don't get them.

704
00:41:05,527 --> 00:41:06,726

00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,590
so, how do
we do this?

887
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,307
I like a lot of
strawberries.

888
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:49,312
And syrup.

889
00:50:50,857 --> 00:50:52,857
And butter.

890
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:58,896
So how long have
you had super powers?

891
00:50:58,906 --> 00:51:01,566
Who told you I
have super powers?

892
00:51:01,576 --> 00:51:04,407
Oh, I have 'em, too.

893
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:07,201
How long has that
been going on?

894
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:10,621
Well, I've been able
to fly for about...

895
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:13,958
six-and-a-half years now.

896
00:51:13,968 --> 00:51:15,121
Flying's good.

897
00:51:15,131 --> 00:51:17,131
Yeah.

898
00:51:17,884 --> 00:51:20,344
Butter?
Yes, please.

899
00:51:22,722 --> 00:51:24,839
Would you like me to
warm this up for you?

900
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,849
Oh, yes, please.

901
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:34,265
These waffles are
unbelievable.

902
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:36,570
Thank you.
it's my pleasure.

903
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:49,864
Do you think I could
take a picture with
you, Mr. Robinson?

904
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:51,874
I guess so.

905
00:51:53,836 --> 00:51:57,376
Visible or
invisible?

906
00:51:57,386 --> 00:51:58,789
Invisible.

907
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:02,172
Can you wait
just a minute?
Yeah, yeah.

908
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:03,544
Oh, no
you don't!

909
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:06,297
Now you stop that.
You stop that,
right now!

910
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:09,592
What have I said? Get
your-- Will you stop it?

911
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:12,177
You can't see me!
I'm invisible!
Stop it! Right now!

912
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,680
You can't see me!
Stop it, William.

913
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,181
Can't see me!
Yes I can.

914
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:19,977
William,
William, listen to me.
You are not invisible.

915
00:52:19,987 --> 00:52:21,987
Mom.

916
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,858
Rick.

917
00:52:25,868 --> 00:52:29,324
Hi, Dad.

918
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:32,286
What are you doing here?

919
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:34,918
We're having breakfast.

920
00:52:37,629 --> 00:52:41,545
Well, leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

921
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:44,251
[Mrs. Robinson]
Oh honey, just go wait
downstairs, please.

922
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,661
He doesn't want you
to see him like this.

923
00:52:47,723 --> 00:52:50,392
It's okay.
Shhh.....

924
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
How ya doing?

925
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,695
Let's just go, okay?

926
00:53:37,105 --> 00:53:39,686
He's okay now,
he's sleeping.

927
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:42,350
He's really glad
you came, Richie.

928
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,601
I'm really sorry.
Honestly, I didn't know.

929
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:46,187
Oh, he'll be fine.
Don't you worry.

930
00:53:46,197 --> 00:53:48,570
You're welcome
anytime.

931
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,692
Are you coming
for Christmas?

932
00:53:50,702 --> 00:53:52,443
I don't know
if I can yet.

933
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:56,030
Oh honey, I'd much
rather you come and
see us than send checks.

934
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,657
We're not going to
starve, you know.

935
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,117
I know, Mom.

936
00:53:59,127 --> 00:54:03,584
Well, I told your father
you would come back, so...

937
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:07,797
Could you please come
back for Christmas?

938
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:09,502
Okay. Okay.

939
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:13,015
Oh great.
I'll be back for Christmas.

940
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:34,657
Was he always like this?

941
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,662
No.

942
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:41,330
He used to be
really cool.

943
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:44,120
But when I was about 15,
he lost his job,

944
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,080
and his mind,

945
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,087
and most of our money.

946
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:50,584
It's a real treat
bringing friends home.

947
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:54,164
Especially when he
decided to be invisible.

948
00:54:55,766 --> 00:55:00,719
Yeah, well, if it makes you
feel any better, my father
actually was invisible.

949
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:06,183
He left when I was young,
and mom didn't really cope
with it well, so...

950
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:09,144
I went to live with my
uncle when I was thirteen.

951
00:55:09,154 --> 00:55:10,145
I'm sorry.

952
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:11,939
It's all right,
don't be.

953
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:14,244
I turned out okay,
didn't I?

954
00:55:15,577 --> 00:55:17,579
Oh, thanks.

955
00:55:18,956 --> 00:55:20,114
What?

956
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:21,949
Uh, nothing.

957
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:24,368
Put your glasses on.
You're making me nervous.

958
00:55:24,378 --> 00:55:25,911
My eyes are tired.

959
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,121
You know, I could
always drive.

960
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:29,712
Yeah, I don't think so.

961
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:34,902
After what happened last time,
we'd probably end up in Alaska.

962
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:43,262
I did mention the gas gauge
was broken, didn't I?

963
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:44,429
Yes.
Didn't I?

964
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:45,931
Yes, yes you did.

965
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:48,934
And I accept the consequences
for it.
Consequences?

966
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,983
What would those be?

967
00:55:50,993 --> 00:55:54,116
My ass is on the line,
not yours!

968
00:56:00,038 --> 00:56:03,203
Whoa, whoa.
Rick. Rick!

969
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,627
You ruined my life!

970
00:56:16,805 --> 00:56:19,140
That was rude, wasn't it?

971
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:26,518
Okay. Okay. You know
what we're going to do?

972
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:28,932
We are going to pretend
this didn't happen

973
00:56:28,942 --> 00:56:34,025
and that we're just taking
a little break, okay?

974
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:36,236
Okay.

975
00:56:36,246 --> 00:56:38,738
And, I apologize.

976
00:56:38,748 --> 00:56:41,491
[pig squeals]

977
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:43,952
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

979
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,180
Save Dorothy!

980
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:36,379
I can't believe this
is happening to me.

981
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:40,675
You do realize I have to
be on a plane in 24 hours.

982
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:42,588
Can't you take
the bar another time?

983
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:45,388
I'll lose my job.

984
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:49,387
I was valedictorian.
Top of my class in law
school. Straight A's.

985
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:51,435
All the way through.

986
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:53,849
I can't mess up now.
Not even this once.

987
00:57:53,859 --> 00:57:58,275
Do you really care
about this job that much?

988
00:57:58,285 --> 00:58:01,904
It's everything
I've worked for.

989
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:03,859
It's everything
I've ever wanted.

990
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:06,826
Everything?

991
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:08,831
Yeah.

992
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:13,369
Okay, then.

993
00:58:13,379 --> 00:58:16,539
Okay. If this job means
that much to you,

994
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:20,542
then I promise I will
do everything in my
power to get us there.

995
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:21,919
We're going to make it.

996
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,734
All right?
We're going to make it.

997
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,408
Just as soon as
someone comes along.

Hey guys!

Orlie!

1001
00:58:58,136 --> 00:59:00,258
I told you.

1002
00:59:05,472 --> 00:59:07,808
Okay. Come on.

1003
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:15,823
Thanks a lot.
You're good to go.

1004
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,326
No, d-d-don't
wake him up.

1005
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:38,376
Don't wake him up.
Sorry.

1006
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:45,382
So, what's your
ex-boyfriend do?

1007
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:47,387
He used to be
a fireman.

1008
00:59:48,181 --> 00:59:49,964
Well, that's
interesting.

1009
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:51,758
Wow.

1010
00:59:51,768 --> 00:59:54,052
Well, there's not as
many fires as you think.

1011
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:57,477
So, why are you
scared of girls?

1012
00:59:57,487 --> 00:59:58,765
I'm not.

1013
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:00,777
You can't talk to them.

1014
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:02,644
I'm talking to you.

1015
01:00:02,654 --> 01:00:05,629
Well, that's a
little different.
How?

1016
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:09,364
Okay, let's practice.

1017
01:00:09,374 --> 01:00:11,194
Pretend I'm
this beautiful,

1018
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:13,368

1019

And we're on a train,
and it's cold,

1020
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:18,242
so I have to sit
very close to you.

1021
01:00:18,252 --> 01:00:20,833
Okay?
Okay.

1022
01:00:20,843 --> 01:00:22,838
Hello.

1023
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:28,961
Hi, do you want
to go out with me?

1024
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:30,296
[laughing]
Yeah, okay,

1025
01:00:30,306 --> 01:00:33,508
or you could just
introduce yourself first.

1026
01:00:33,518 --> 01:00:35,640
Okay.
Okay.

1027
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,184
Hello.

01:00:38,194 --> 01:00:40,353
Hi, I'm Rick.

1029
01:00:40,363 --> 01:00:42,308
Hello, Rick.

1030
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:45,061
[with Russian accent]
What do you do?

1031
01:00:45,071 --> 01:00:46,812
I'm a law intern.

1032
01:00:46,822 --> 01:00:48,272
Yeah, okay,
when you meet someone,

1033
01:00:48,282 --> 01:00:49,941
you want to put
your best foot forward.

1034
01:00:49,951 --> 01:00:51,400
Okay? So, say...

1035
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,569
Say you're taking
the bar exam in 20 hours,

1036
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:54,945
and you have
this amazing job
lined up

1037
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:58,537
with the best
law firm in Miami.
All right?

1038
01:00:58,547 --> 01:01:01,582
All right.

1039
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:05,044
[with Russian accent]
So, Rick,

1040
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:07,713
where do you live?

1041
01:01:07,723 --> 01:01:09,502
Miami, Florida, USA.

1042
01:01:09,512 --> 01:01:12,218
Oh! Oh, Miami,
I love Miami!

1043
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:14,965
Oh, the beach,
the ocean, the sand...

1044
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:17,431
oh, the water, oh...

1045
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:20,142
[whimpering]

1046
01:01:20,152 --> 01:01:22,436
Are you okay?

1047
01:01:22,446 --> 01:01:24,647
I'm sorry.
[laughing]

1048
01:01:24,657 --> 01:01:28,948
Wow, yikes.
Skin walkers are coming.

1049
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:36,111
I liked how you were
with my dad.

1050
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:38,452
[Orlie snoring]
Yeah?

1051
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:43,047
Well, actors have
a lot in common
with the mentally ill.

1052
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:50,130
Well, I'm glad
you're here.

1053
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,971
I think we're
gonna make it.

1054
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,056
[Rick]
I gotta call Carl.

1055
01:02:04,066 --> 01:02:06,058
[Michelle]
Oh, good, because
I really need to tinkle.

1056
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:08,737
[Orlie]
Don't force it.

1057
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:16,068
...and all I see
around me are the stars,

1058
01:02:16,078 --> 01:02:19,284
I'm naked, and, uh,

1059
01:02:19,294 --> 01:02:21,031
I speak Portuguese
for some reason.

1060
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,365
Why Portuguese?
[cell phone ringing]

1061
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:25,619
Well, because it's
a beautiful language.
Hello?

1062
01:02:25,629 --> 01:02:26,870
Carl, it's Rick!

1063
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,330
<i>Who?
Rick.</i>

1064
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,377
<i>Rick who?
Copy room Rick.</i>

1065
01:02:30,387 --> 01:02:31,750
Hey, Rick.

1066
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,211
Oh, I booked you
on the 7:30 out of LAX.

1067
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:36,129
It's the last one
if you want to make the Bar.

1068
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:38,965
Great, we'll still have
a couple hours to spare.

1069
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:40,467
Hey, how's
the studying going?

1070
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:41,968
Pretty good, pretty good.

1071
01:02:41,978 --> 01:02:43,345
Could we get
some more eel sauce?
Sure.

1072
01:02:43,355 --> 01:02:45,847
Thank you.
You want to go
get that right now?

1073
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:48,141
Carl, you need to think
about the future.

1074
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:49,809

from the Thundercats?</i>

1077
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:58,443
Uh, I have to go, Rick.

1078
01:02:58,453 --> 01:03:02,791
I'm... I'm
entertaining someone.

1079
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,868
Okay, come on,
let's go.

1080
01:03:06,878 --> 01:03:08,878
In a minute.

1081
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:12,337
Dance with me.

1082
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:13,917
What?

1083
01:03:13,927 --> 01:03:15,126
Dance with me.

1084
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,295
Really? What about
the Bar exam?

1085
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:19,213
What about your dream job?
What, did you forget?

1086
01:03:19,223 --> 01:03:21,554
Five minutes.
One dance.

1087
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,092
Live a little.

1088
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,510
What would Uncle Max say?

1089
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,929
I really don't care
what Uncle Max
would say right now.

1090
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:29,317
Oh...Oh!

[laughing]

1101
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,040
That happens.

1102
01:04:44,683 --> 01:04:47,828
Hey, what's happening--
[pig grunting]

1103
01:05:03,702 --> 01:05:06,445
[Michelle]
You know, you're actually
a really good dancer.

1104
01:05:06,455 --> 01:05:08,455
Thank you.

1105

Skin walkers are coming.

1106
01:05:24,306 --> 01:05:26,173
Oh, my God.
Orlie!

1107
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,758
Locke, don't open
the hatch!

1108
01:05:27,768 --> 01:05:29,973
Orlie,
are you okay?

1109
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:32,100
Orlie.
Yeah, I'm okay.

1110
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,014
[Michelle]
Rick, what are you doing?

1111
01:05:34,024 --> 01:05:36,683
Waiting for a semi
to come finish me off.

1112
01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:38,899
No, we can't
just give up.

1113
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:41,484
The truck's gone!
Wow.

1114
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:43,570
Yeah, but
so is Dorothy.

1115
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:46,890
Well, at least
they didn't take
my stuff.

1116
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:52,907
Y'all okay?

1117
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:55,623
Lost my truck.

1118
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:57,078
Left it
right here.

1119
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:59,586
What do you drive?

1120
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:01,629
A Paradise.

1121
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:03,634
[laughing]

1122
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,261
Paradise, I'm sorry--

1123
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:09,674
I'm sorry for that.

1124
01:06:09,684 --> 01:06:13,766
Earl, who'd steal
a damn Paradise truck?

1125
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:16,019
Oh...

1126
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:17,724
Oh, you think
the Lady's got it?

1127
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:20,398
Maybe.

1128
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:21,936
Now, when you guys
see the Lady,

1129
01:06:21,946 --> 01:06:24,694
you've got
to be respectful.

1130
01:06:24,704 --> 01:06:26,107
Is she someone
important?

1131
01:06:26,117 --> 01:06:29,687
Yeah, if'n you want
to get your truck back.

1132
01:06:31,956 --> 01:06:34,495
So, she knows
where it is?

1133
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,998
The Lady knows
everything.
Yup.

1134

Lady knowed
everything.

1135
01:06:39,218 --> 01:06:42,336
You'll get
your truck back,

1136
01:06:42,346 --> 01:06:44,341
or...

1137
01:06:55,062 --> 01:06:57,054
It's that big door
over there.

1138
01:06:57,064 --> 01:07:00,187
Now, ya'll ask
for the Lady,

1139
01:07:00,197 --> 01:07:02,481
all right?
[Michelle]
Okay.

1140
01:07:02,491 --> 01:07:03,769
Well, get out!

1141
01:07:03,779 --> 01:07:06,110
Come on, now!

1142
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,534
Thank you.
Get going.

1143
01:07:12,872 --> 01:07:14,321
All right, remember,

1144
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:17,908
don't let the door hit you
where the good Lord split you.

[screaming happily]

1146
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:31,255
There's no one here.

1147
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:35,723
Me and my friends
want to see the Lady!

1148
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:39,565
[Michelle]
No, no, just
wait a minute.

1149
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:47,401
Hi.

1150
01:07:47,411 --> 01:07:49,616
We're here
to see the Lady.

1151
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,527
Yeah.

1152
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:56,613
[Rick]
I have a bad feeling
about this.

1153
01:07:56,623 --> 01:07:59,700
[Orlie]
Come on, show a little
backbone, will you?

1154

Yeah?

1159
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:56,047
What's the capital
of Kentucky?

1160
01:08:56,057 --> 01:08:58,179
[whispers]
Lexington.

1161
01:08:58,189 --> 01:09:00,932
Frankfort.

1162
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:02,262
Louisville?

01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:05,395
Frankfort.

1164
01:09:05,405 --> 01:09:08,982
Knowledge.

1165
01:09:08,992 --> 01:09:12,819
You know what
I'm saying?

1166
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:16,067
Now, I really don't cotton
much to strangers

1167
01:09:16,077 --> 01:09:19,445
just dropping by
uninvited in my little
establishment here,

1168
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:22,657
so, you'd better have
a very good reason.

1169
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:25,665
Someone stole
our truck.

1170
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:29,210
I don't see anybody
talking to you, skirt.

1171
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,957
Yeah, but I--
Someone stole our truck.

1172
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,339
Mmm, you think I took it.

1173
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:35,388
No, I-- I mean,
never.

1174
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,427
But supposin' I did,

1175
01:09:37,437 --> 01:09:41,597
I wonder what could
possibly be in it for me.

1176
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:47,603
Oh, well...I've got,
like, 34 bucks in change.

1177
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:51,107
And you can have him.

1178
01:09:51,117 --> 01:09:54,777
Or, you two boys
could work it off.

1179
01:09:54,787 --> 01:09:56,904
I've been
just itching...

1180
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:59,615

some new blood.

you expect? I mean,

our separate ways.

1413
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:43,289
Rick, this is Carl.

1414
01:27:43,299 --> 01:27:45,458
I just wanted
to leave you a message.

1415
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:48,086
Your phone's
not working, for one.

1416
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,593
And second...

1417
01:27:50,603 --> 01:27:55,431
these questions were harder
than I thought they would be.

1418
01:27:55,441 --> 01:27:57,804
But I saved you a seat
in case you arrive late.

1419
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,974
I mean, I don't know
if that does you any good,

1420
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:04,482
but uh...I just
want to tell you

1421
01:28:04,492 --> 01:28:08,491
what a good friend
you've been, Rick.

1422
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:15,118
I'm gonna call you back.
