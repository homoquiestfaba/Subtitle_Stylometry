00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,307
WHAT WAS THAT?

756
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,775
>> DISTURBING.

757
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,811
>> YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

758
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,145
>> WHAT? DISTURBING.

759
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,549
>> ALL RIGHT, SHOW'S OVER.

760
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,184
ART HAS SPOKEN.

761
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,852
PETER, EVA. EVA, PETER.

762
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,820
>> WONDERFUL.

763
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,355
>> WAS IT?

764
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,789
>> SOMEBODY FIND HIM.

765
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,390
>> COME BACK AND HAVE SOME CAKE.

766
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:19,957
>> I GOT TO GO.

767
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,825
>> NO, COME ON.

768
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:21,792
>> HERB, COME ON.

769
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,360
>> YOU COULD HAVE KEPT YOUR

770
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,494
MOUTH SHUT.

771
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,163
>> WE'RE NOT LAB RATS.

772
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:30,901
>> WHAT A MESS.

773
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:31,802
ERIC IS SUCH A MESS.

774
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,239
I CAN'T STOP THINKING -- CAN I

775
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,575
TAKE SOMETHING FOR THAT?

776
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:38,809
>> NO.

777
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,012
>> USELESS.

778
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,849
YOU COMING?

779
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,852
>> IN A BIT.

780
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,961
>> WHAT'S FOR LUNCH?

781
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,329
>> THE USUAL -- CHEESE, FRUIT,

782
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,031
BEANS.

783
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,966
>> CAVIAR.

784
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,935
>> DREAMS.

785
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,152
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD?

786
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:43,153
>> NOTHING WORTH REPEATING.

787
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:48,999
>> LOUIS...HOW'S THE TIME?

788
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,936
>> STOPPED.

789
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,607
>> BORING, BORING, AND MORE

790
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,877
BORING.

791
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,279
IT'S ALL SO BEAUTIFULLY BORING,

792
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,347
AND THEN THERE'S THAT.

793
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,282
>> WHERE'S ERIC?

794
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:05,950
>> JOHAN, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO

795
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:06,717
THAT?

796
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,686
>> DO WHAT?

797
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,888
>> APPEAR.

798
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,227
>> HAVE YOU SEEN ALEX?

799
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,863
>> NOT FOR A WHILE.

800
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:23,033
>> WE WERE GONNA CHECK THE NEST.

801
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,238
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

802
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,639
>> WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

803
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,074
>> THERE'S NO FIRING OF GUNS ON

804
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,442
THE PROPERTY.

805
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,011
>> TALK TO JOHAN.

806
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,982
>> I'M TALKING TO YOU.

807
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,487
OHH, BROTHER.

808
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,054
OKAY, IF YOU SEE ALEX, TELL HER

809
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,956
I WAITED.

810
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,070
>> YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS --

811
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,739
YOU KNOW THAT?

812
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,307
>> I DO?

813
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,276
>> YEAH.

814
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:13,277
>> THANK YOU.

815
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,765
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

816
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:30,968
>> THINK ABOUT WHAT?

817
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,103
>> HE'S NOT LIKE YOU.

818
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,873
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

819
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,275
>> HE'LL EAT YOU ALIVE.

820
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,879
>> YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

821
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:50,654
>> WELL, YOU'LL SEE.

822
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,207
>> CHARGE!

823
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,242
LIGHT BRIGADE.

824
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,644
LITTLE HORSES.

825
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:14,511
GO.

826
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:16,914
>> LET ME SEE THAT.

827
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,082
>> WAIT.

828
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:18,549
HEY, CAREFUL -- IT'S LOADED!

829
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,985
OH, THAT IS NOT OKAY!

830
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,520
>> THERE -- SOMETHING HAPPENED.

831
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,089
>> YEAH, YOU BLEW MY EARS OUT.

832
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,023
>> IF YOU SEE ERIC, I'M AT THE

833
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,225
BLIND.

834
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,760
THAT IS NOT OKAY.

835
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:30,561
>> NO FIRING GUNS ON THE

836
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,996
PROPERTY!

837
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,197
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

838
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,165
WHO ARE THOSE CHILDREN?

839
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,768
>> HEY, KIDS, BE CAREFUL.

840
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,037
>> YOU'RE THE ONE FIRING GUNS!

841
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:40,704
>> KIDS, GET AWAY FROM THAT

842
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,740
CART!

843
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,208
>> DON'T WORRY -- THESE FILLIES

844
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,743
ARE UNDER FULL DISCIPLINED

845
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,744
CONTROL.

846
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:47,277
>> OH, MY GOD.

847
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,345
>> HERB, STOP!

848
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:48,879
>> STOP THAT CART!

849
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,680
>> WHOA!

850
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,247
>> HERB!

851
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:53,851
>> OH, GOD.

852
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,819
>> HERB!

853
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,722
OH, HERB!

854
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:05,763
OH!

855
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,964
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

856
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,265
HERB!

857
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:12,102
OH, IT'S NOT FUNNY!

858
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,204
>> IT MUST BE THE WATER --

859
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,474
MAKES US ALL MAD AS A BOX OF

860
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,777
FROGS.

861
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,211
>> I LOVE YOU.

862
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,147
>> YOU NEED TO MOVE.

863
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,950
>> YOU COULD'VE KILLED THIS MAN!

864
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:27,584
>> OH, STOP IT, MARY.

865
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,886
I'M ALL RIGHT.

866
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,154
>> WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

867
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,221
>> THEY JUST SHOWED UP.

868
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,156
>> LET'S GET YOU INSIDE.

869
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:32,756
>> I'D LIKE TO STAY.

870
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:33,457
>> NO.

871
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:35,325
>> VETOED.

872
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,628
>> WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?

873
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,730
>> WHO CARES?

874
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,132
>> DEMONS.

875
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,950
>> PETER.

876
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,985
PETER, PETER, PETER.

877
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,859
>> HOW'S THE FISHING?

878
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,260
>> FINE, I GUESS.

879
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,195
THERE'S RODS UP THERE IN THE

880
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,463
SHED.

881
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,331
>> I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN

882
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,267
HOW TO FISH.

883
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,937
>> IT'S DULL...LIKE EVERYTHING

884
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,972
ELSE AROUND HERE -- REALLY,

885
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,309
REALLY DULL.

886
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,681
>> SHE'S SPYING ON US.

887
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,884
>> IS SHE?

888
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,285
WHY IS THAT?

889
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,186
>> I DON'T THINK SHE TRUSTS US.

890
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,789
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

891
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,957
>> WHEN YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE LONG

892
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:44,461
ENOUGH, YOU BEGIN TO HEAR THEIR

893
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,364
THOUGHTS LIKE YOUR VERY OWN.

894
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,032
>> WE'RE JUST SITTING HERE.

895
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,334
>> TALKING.

896
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,302
>> AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

897
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,071
>> OH, EVERYTHING.

898
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,039
>> FOR EXAMPLE?

899
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,375
>> WE COULD SAY THINGS.

900
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,877
>> LIKE WHAT?

901
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:00,744
>> I COULD SAY HOW ATTRACTIVE

902
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,313
YOU ARE.

903
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,548
YOU COULD SAY HOW FAMOUS I AM.

904
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,518
>> HER IMAGINATION IS VAST.

905
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,061
BORING, BORING.

906
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,367
>> I SHOULD GET HER INSIDE.

907
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,102
>> DID I MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE?

908
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,070
>> NO.

909
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:35,071
SHE DOES.

910
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:09,466
>> GROSS.

911
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,649
>> IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR DICK

912
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,383
DOWN, DARLING, YOU'LL RUN INTO

913
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,351
SOMETHING.

914
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,458
IT'S TEMPTING -- I KNOW.

915
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,227
YOU JUST WANT TO CRAWL INSIDE

916
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:31,395
THAT YOUNG VAGINA AND HIDE FROM

917
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:34,197
THE WORLD, BUT YOU'LL BE

918
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,034
DISAPPOINTED.

919
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:41,471
SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE,

920
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,474
NO ENDURANCE, NO TRAINING,

921
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,642
NO MUSCLE.

922
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:46,343
YOU'LL HATE IT.

923
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:47,210
>> MM.

924
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,512
>> YOU WILL.

925
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:49,046
>> MM-HMM.

926
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,247
>> STOP.

927
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,149
>> NO, COME ON.

928
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,117
>> I SAID STOP IT. STOP IT.

929
00:40:54,118 --> 00:41:02,118
STO--

930
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,184
>> EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

931
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:28,051
>> DIDN'T SEE YOU.

932
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,119
>> IT HAPPENS.

933
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,389
YOU OKAY?

934
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,924
>> I'M FINE. THANK YOU.

935
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:38,395
THIS BOTHER YOU?

936
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,963
>> NOPE. HOW'S HERB?

937
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,598
>> WET.

938
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,536
>> HE'S THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE

939
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,538
WHO EVER ENJOYS HIMSELF.

940
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,409
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING?

941
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:54,745
I'M LEAVING.

942
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,080
>> OH?

943
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,482
>> I'M GETTING OLD.

01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,198
HEY, PETER.

1498
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,266
>> PETER, ABE. ABE, PETER.

1499
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:25,267
>> FOUND HIM IN THE CLOSET.

1500
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:26,868
>> HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1501
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:27,769
>> HE'S MINE.

1502
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,370
>> HI, DOCTOR.

1503
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:30,372
>> CAPTAIN.

1504
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,440
>> A DOZEN TIMES, HE'S TRIED TO

1505
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,476
ESCAPE.

1506
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:36,511
MAYBE WE SHOULD LET HIM.

1507
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:37,445
>> JUST CLOSE THE CAGE.

1508
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:38,713
>> I DIDN'T OPEN IT.

1509
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,215
>> SURE, YOU DIDN'T.

1510
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:42,684
HE ALMOST FLEW OUT THE BACK

1511
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,386
DOOR, WHICH YOU ALSO LEFT OPEN.

1512
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:45,954
>> I CAN'T EVEN GET OUT OF THIS

1513
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:46,554
DAMN CHAIR -- HOW CAN I OPEN A

1514
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:47,822
CAGE?

1515
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,357
>> HE'S NOT READY YET.

1516
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:52,027
>> SO YOU SAY, BUT LOOK AT THE

1517
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:52,894
KID -- HE WANTS OUT.

1518
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,664
>> SOON.

1519
01:13:55,665 --> 01:13:56,965
>> WELL, NOW.

1520
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:57,666
>> I'M SORRY.

1521
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:04,506
EXCUSE ME.

1522
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,746
>> HE SAID HE HAD TO SEE THE

1523
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,416
LAKE.

1524
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:15,750
HE'S HAD A HORRIBLE TIME.

1525
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,519
HE NEEDED TO COME BACK.

1526
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,354
>> HERB, DO WE HAVE TO?

1527
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:19,988
ABE IS SO MUCH HAPPIER EATING IN

1528
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:21,089
HIS CAGE.

1529
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,757
>> WELL, I INSIST.

1530
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,025
>> WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.

1531
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,193
>> MMM.

1532
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,928
>> IS PETER OKAY?

1533
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,530
>> EVERYTHING'S FINE.

1534
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:29,597
>> I'LL LEAVE HIM A BOWL IN THE

1535
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:30,899
KITCHEN.

1536
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,067
>> I LIKE YOUR UNIFORM.

1537
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:34,769
IT'S MI-- IT'S MISSING A FEW

1538
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,271
PATCHES.

1539
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:37,906
>> DID YOU SEE THE NEW TRUCK OUT

1540
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,574
THERE?

1541
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,241
SO PROUD OF MY BOY.

1542
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:41,376
>> THANKS, POP.

1543
01:14:41,377 --> 01:14:41,843
>> DON'T CALL ME THAT.

1544
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:42,844
>> YES, DAD.

1545
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:43,745
>> I'M NOT YOUR DAD.

1546
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:46,414
>> NOTHING CHANGES.

1547
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:48,550
>> WILL YOU BE TAKING ABE TO

1548
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,019
LIVE WITH YOU?

1549
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,587
>> YEAH, THE RESERVATION HAS AN

1550
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:54,089
EDUCATION CENTER, SO I'LL TAKE

1551
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:54,522
HIM THERE UNTIL HE'S READY TO BE

1552
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:55,690
RELEASED.

1553
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:57,559
>> WHEN YOU DON'T NEED HIM

1554
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,928
ANYMORE.

1555
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:00,628
>> IS THAT CORIANDER?

1556
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,596
>> CUMIN.

1557
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:02,697
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

1558
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,666
IT'S LOVELY.

1559
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,540
>> NOT ENOUGH SALT.

1560
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,308
>> EXCUSE ME.

1561
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:15,443
>> PARSLEY.

1562
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,711
>> OH, I LOVE PARSLEY.

1563
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,214
>> CAN YOU PASS ME SOME BREAD,

1564
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:20,548
PLEASE?

1565
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:21,549
OH, THANK YOU.

1566
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,951
>> YOU NEED TO SEND ME THE

1567
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,120
RECIPE.

1568
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:32,961
>> I WILL.

1569
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,133
>> I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

1570
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:41,736
IT'S SO COLD, ISN'T IT?

1571
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:44,639
MY FACE IS LIKE AN ICICLE.

1572
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,640
>> COME INSIDE.

1573
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:46,641
>> NO, THANK YOU.

1574
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:47,509
R-REALLY, I'M FINE.

1575
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,944
>> PLEASE.

1576
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:51,346
YOU LOOK FREEZING.

1577
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:53,948
>> JUST FOR A MINUTE...

1578
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:58,753
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO.

1579
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:14,636
ISN'T IT FUNNY?

1580
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:17,605
THEY ALL COME BACK WHEN IT'S

1581
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:22,811
TIME TO GO.

1582
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:24,646
EVEN PETER -- HE'S HERE.

1583
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:26,381
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

1584
01:16:26,382 --> 01:16:27,682
I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR

1585
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:30,318
HIM.

1586
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,352
HE JUST DISAPPEARED.

1587
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,554
I COULDN'T FIND HIM.

1588
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:34,656
I COULDN'T FIND ANYONE.

1589
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:38,493
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

1590
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,063
MY FAMILY LEFT, TOO.

1591
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:44,032
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

1592
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:47,702
>> YES.

1593
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:52,373
>> SOMEONE'S BUYING UP THE WHOLE

1594
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:56,511
LAKE.

1595
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:58,613
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

1596
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,548
WINNER TAKES ALL.

1597
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:10,592
I STILL REMEMBER THAT NIGHT.

1598
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:12,627
"THE MOST BARBAROUS AGES..."

1599
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,497
IT'S NOT TRUE, IS IT?

1600
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,734
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE FAMOUS?

1601
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,604
>> I'M NOT.

1602
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:26,007
>> YOU ARE...

1603
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,209
AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY.

1604
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,611
THAT BIRD -- INCREDIBLE, ISN'T

1605
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:33,414
SHE?

1606
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:34,749
SO BEAUTIFUL.

1607
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,885
I WISH I COULD HOLD HER.

1608
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,426
IT WAS A DISASTER.

1609
01:17:48,631 --> 01:17:51,766
I CAN'T STAY.

1610
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:56,704
I JUST...

1611
01:17:56,705 --> 01:18:00,441
WANTED TO TELL YOU...

1612
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,309
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

1613
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:09,817
AND THAT I MISS YOU.

1614
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:19,854
>> EVA?!

1615
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:25,667
EVA!

1616
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:35,269
EVA!

1617
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:51,052
EVA!

1618
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:14,275
EVA!

1619
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:02,830
>> FOR THE CITY, IT'S A VERY

1620
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,732
NICE PLACE -- LARGE DINING ROOM,

1621
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:05,833
STUDY, DECENT KITCHEN, PLENTY OF

1622
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:06,768
ROOM FOR THREE OR FOUR

1623
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:09,237
COMFORTABLY.

1624
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:12,540
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR HERB.

1625
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,108
>> MOMMY, I HAVE TO TINKLE.

1626
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:15,043
>> WHY DOESN'T DADDY TAKE YOU?

1627
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:16,678
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY,

1628
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:17,845
TINKLE TOES?

1629
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,180
HOW MUCH DO I LOVE YOU?

1630
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:19,847
>> PAST THE STARS.

1631
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:20,248
>> AWW!

1632
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,116
>> AWW.

1633
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:25,353
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL

1634
01:20:25,354 --> 01:20:28,056
IT WORKED OUT -- SUCH A RELIEF.

1635
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,257
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW...HARD IT'S

1636
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:30,024
BEEN SORTING EVERYTHING --

1637
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,926
ALL THE PAPERWORK.

1638
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,861
WE'VE KILLED A FOREST.

1639
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:34,429
THE NEW OWNERS SEEM LIKE NICE

1640
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:36,230
PEOPLE.

1641
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:37,932
YOU'LL GET ALONG JUST FINE.

1642
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:38,900
DEVELOPERS -- APPARENTLY,

1643
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:40,535
THERE'S A BOOM COMING.

1644
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:43,037
>> YEAH.

1645
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:51,038
>> WELL, THEN, THERE'S HOPE.

1646
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:18,072
>> I'LL TAKE THE BOWLS.

1647
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:23,244
>> I'M AFRAID THERE'S -- THERE'S

1648
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:25,279
NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF DESSERT.

1649
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,949
>> PAST THE STARS.

1650
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,851
>> I HAVE KEPT OUT ENOUGH --

1651
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:32,854
ENOUGH TEA AND COFFEE TO GET US

1652
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:34,789
THROUGH TO SUNDAY.

1653
01:21:49,171 --> 01:21:54,142
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

1654
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,380
>> JUST A HUNTER.

1655
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,449
I'LL TELL THEM TO SHOO.

1656
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:13,661
>> I'LL BE BACK.

1657
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:15,630
EXCUSE ME.

1658
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:19,467
>> SOMETHING I SAID?

1659
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:35,683
WE SHOULD HAVE EATEN OUTSIDE.

1660
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:39,520
>> I LOVE YOU...

1661
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:40,988
AND I'M WITH YOU.

1662
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:42,957
>> I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY THAT TO

1663
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:50,832
YOU.

1664
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,969
I THINK I'LL...GO SEE WHAT'S

1665
01:22:54,970 --> 01:23:02,970
GOING ON.

1666
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,573
ERIC.

1667
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:41,115
>> NO. NO!

1668
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,552
>> JOHAN!

1669
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:45,987
> NO! NO!

1670
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:47,788
NO! NO!

1671
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,090
>> "HE CLASPS THE CRAG

1672
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:50,491
WITH CROOKED HANDS..."

1673
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:54,061
>> NO!

1674
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,163
>> "...CLOSE TO THE SUN

1675
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:57,398
IN LONELY LANDS..."

1676
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:04,672
>> "...RING'D WITH

1677
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:06,774
THE AZURE WORLD, HE STANDS.

THE WRINKLED SEA

1679
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,978
BENEATH HIM CRAWLS;

1680
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:12,013
HE WATCHES..."

1681
01:24:12,014 --> 01:24:12,947
>> NO!

1682
01:24:12,948 --> 01:24:16,250
>> "...FROM

1683
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,286
HIS MOUNTAIN WALLS..."

1684
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:26,961
>> "...AND LIKE A THUNDERBOLT

1685
01:24:26,962 --> 01:24:34,962
HE FALLS."

1686
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,045
LET'S OPEN THE WINDOW...

1687
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:46,080
AND GET SOME BREEZE THROUGH

1688
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:53,287
HERE.

1689
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:32,052
IT'S COOL.
