1
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,804
'and I have a message for them.'

2
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:19,308
The tyrant will soon be gone.

3
00:00:19,203 --> 00:00:22,854
The day of your liberation is near.

4
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:27,756
'All the decades of deceit
and cruelty have now reached an end.

5
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:34,639
'Saddam Hussein and his sons
must leave Iraq within 48 hours.'

6
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:38,498
Their refusal to do so
will result in military conflict

7
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:41,523
commenced at a time
of our choosing.

8
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:47,364
'Events in Iraq have now reached
the final days of decision.'

9
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,664
Where's Mama? Inside,
she's packing. Why is she packing?

10
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:57,376
Mama, what are you doing?
We can buy new glasses.

11
00:00:57,376 --> 00:01:01,026
Make sure your mother and sisters
have money.

12
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:03,842
Go, and make sure they listen.

13
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:07,597
'They must leave the country
immediately.' Mustafa, the suitcases.

14
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:09,162
Hala, quickly.

15
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:11,352
'But we will not leave Iraq.'

16
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:16,671
We keep moving until the Americans
are defeated. Yes, Papa. Now go.

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,947
Take care of your brother, Qusay.

18
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,972
I will.

19
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:29,812
Mama, they are not important.
We have to go.

20
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:38,469
This programme contains some strong
language and some violent scenes.

21
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,507
EXCITED CHATTERING

22
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:27,697
MUSIC PLAYS

23
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:31,556
INDISTINCT

24
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:45,219
Is that my little mouse?

25
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,097
HE LAUGHS

26
00:02:47,097 --> 00:02:50,330
Are you enjoying your party?
Saddam...

27
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,146
Ready when you are. Ah.

28
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,232
Let's go and find Mama.

29
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:58,569
I'll just be a moment, Barzan.

30
00:02:58,569 --> 00:02:59,821
Mm?

31
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:09,416
This little mousey belongs to you.

32
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,294
Habibti.

33
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,797
What time will he come? Soon.

34
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:21,202
Mr Deputy. Mm.

35
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,662
Are they all here?

36
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:25,269
Yes, everyone's here.

37
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,042
Khomeini has a big mouth.

38
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,711
Mm.

39
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,423
SHOUTING ON TV

40
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:33,509
Thank you, Hamdani.

41
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:40,497
PEOPLE CHANT:

42
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:53,221
Heard enough? More than enough.

43
00:03:53,221 --> 00:03:55,411
He is a thoughtless son of a bitch.

44
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,602
Bark, bark, bark, all day long -
every day.

45
00:03:57,602 --> 00:04:00,522
He is a dog with teeth, Ali.

46
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,191
Sharp teeth.

47
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:06,571
We can offer a hand of friendship
but he will bite it off.

48
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:10,013
He wants his revolution
to infect all of the Arab world.

49
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:12,203
Beginning with the Iraqi Shia.

50
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:14,081
Exactly.

51
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,792
He will become more and more
dangerous by the day.

52
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,817
Comrades...

53
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:22,424
time is running out.

54
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:25,762
America hopes for a strong Iraq.

55
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:30,977
The Arab world demands it. The Iraqi
people themselves deserve it.

56
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,044
To the revolution.

57
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:37,443
To the party.

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,738
To unity.

59
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,867
To a new Iraq.

60
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,891
ALL: To a new Iraq.

61
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,069
INDISTINCT CHATTER

62
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:59,137
I'll be out here.

63
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:02,474
Mama.

64
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,481
How is the lemonade?

65
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,358
It's too sweet.

66
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,008
Raghad.

67
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:15,512
Find Mohammed.

68
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,745
Ask him to join the party,
he's shy. Yes.

69
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,585
She's becoming a woman.

70
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:27,610
She's still my baby.

71
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,678
She should marry
Barzan's son, Mohammed.

72
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:35,745
It will bond the family
closer still.

73
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,917
Mr Deputy,
the President is about to arrive.

74
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,316
Mama, excuse me.

75
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,507
Mr President. Mr Deputy.

76
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,844
Sajida, you look beautiful.

77
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:06,826
You are too kind.

78
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:11,206
Thank you so much for coming,
Mr President. Hala will be thrilled.

79
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,605
Not at all,
thank you for inviting an old man

80
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:15,170
to a seventh birthday party.

81
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,673
It is an important occasion.

82
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,765
Please, please, everybody.
Please, carry on.

83
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:26,434
Where is the birthday girl?

84
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:29,145
I can't see her. Here she is.

85
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,544
Where? Where? Here. Here.

86
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:35,612
All I see is a grown-up princess.
Where is little Hala?

87
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,802
It's me, it's me!

88
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:42,391
Then this gift must be yours,
princess. You're very kind.

89
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:45,937
What do we say to the President?

90
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,753
Thank you.
You are very welcome, my child.

91
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:56,158
ALL: # Happy Birthday to you

92
00:06:56,158 --> 00:07:00,017
# Happy Birthday to you

93
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:05,754
# Happy Birthday, dear Hala

94
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:10,760
# Happy Birthday to you. #

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,975
Make a wish, habibti,
and your dreams will come true.

96
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,024
CHEERING

97
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,570
Let's leave the women
and children to their games.

98
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,447
We have much to discuss,
Mr President.

99
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,515
You must save me a piece of cake.
Of course I will.

100
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:33,601
LAUGHTER

101
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:57,589
Mr President...

102
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,663
Please, sit down.

103
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:09,688
There is something I have to say.

104
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,289
I smell disquiet.

105
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,044
I am concerned about Khomeini

106
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:30,130
and the proposed union with Syria.

107
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:37,014
Khomeini continues to call on
our people to join his revolution
because he knows we are weak.

108
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:42,333
And this alliance with Syria
will make us weaker still. Nonsense.

109
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,357
Two Arab people together
will make a strong alliance.

110
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:48,173
Headed by the Syrian President.

111
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:51,407
Assad of Syria will be first
and you will be second.

112
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:55,057
With Saddam Hussein third?
HE LAUGHS

113
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:57,665
Is that your true objection?

114
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:02,254
I have no objection.

115
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:06,947
Why object to something
that does not exist?

116
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,137
And will never exist.

117
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:11,640
I will not allow it.

118
00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:15,812
You will not allow it, Mr Deputy?

119
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,033
I smell more than disquiet.

120
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,015
Comrade Bakr, it's over.

121
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,579
Stop. Say no more.

122
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,874
Saddam...

123
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:34,586
your time will come.

124
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:38,132
We are a team, you and me.
Look at what we have accomplished.

125
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,199
Look at what you have accomplished.

126
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:45,850
Iraq has schools and hospitals
and food for all of the people.

127
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:49,813
For the first time in our history,

128
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:53,046
their minds are developed
and their bellies are full,

129
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:54,715
because of you and me.

130
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:58,991
Our country is just beginning
to walk in the world.

131
00:09:58,991 --> 00:10:05,353
This alliance, us,
we will make Iraq stronger.

132
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:07,857
So...

133
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,298
do I get to eat my cake now?

134
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,654
It is over, comrade.

135
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:20,164
DOORS OPEN

136
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:23,084
They won't help you.

137
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:28,612
Either you resign voluntarily
or through force.

138
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,489
Either way, you resign.

139
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,827
You have earned your retirement

140
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:36,225
and it is the wish of each of us

141
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:40,084
that you get to enjoy it.

142
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:47,802
Adnan Khairallah, you are my Defence
Minister and an officer in my army.

143
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:52,391
Come and stand by my side
and this...this will be forgotten.

144
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:00,944
Hamdani, we think alike you and me.

145
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:03,760
Stand by my side.

146
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,183
You will announce your retirement
due to ill-health

147
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:12,938
and you will name your deputy
as your successor.

148
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,901
The Command Council
will never approve it.

149
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:22,742
You can remain in the Presidential
Palace until matters are resolved.

150
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,392
Comrade.

151
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:46,522
Saddam Hussein al-Majid.
My President.

152
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,798
Tariq Aziz.

153
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,258
My President.

154
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:55,387
Hamdani, my friend.

155
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,264
Mr President.

156
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:17,289
So, it's done.

157
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:20,314
You are to be President.

158
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:25,320
Now you will need your brothers
more than ever. Yes, Mama.

159
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,952
And no-one must be allowed to do to
you, what you have done to al-Bakr.

160
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:32,621
Don't worry, Mama.

161
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,646
I am making Barzan
my head of security.

162
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:38,566
I'll protect him, Mama.

163
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:40,130
Let's put you to bed.

164
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,695
Good boy.

165
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,174
I feel like tomorrow, I will
wake up in a land of...progress

166
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,781
and opportunity.

167
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:05,683
I have ideas to help build Iraq,

168
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:09,125
make it ready to take
its rightful place in the world,

169
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,002
and not just the Arab world.

170
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:13,193
We have a lot of work to do.

171
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,634
Me and you.

172
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,138
And I will always be by your side.

173
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,352
Already I feel different.

174
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,690
You feel empowered. Yes.

175
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,254
And you like it?

176
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:32,905
HE LAUGHS
Yes, very much.

177
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,616
THEY LAUGH

178
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:42,500
What's so funny?
Hamdani likes power.

179
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,377
Yes.

180
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,255
What's wrong with that?

181
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,930
'It is my view that the man best
qualified to assume the leadership'

182
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:59,501
is my esteemed deputy,
Comrade Saddam Hussein.

183
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,691
Mr President, this is absurd!

184
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:05,758
Now is not the time
to be stepping aside.

185
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:10,869
We are on the brink
of a new era in Arab brotherhood.

186
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:13,163
Comrade Mashhadi,
he has made up his mind.

187
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:15,875
We must respect his decision.

188
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:22,342
Mr President, what's going on here?
What is happening?

189
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:26,514
Please comrade, please,
I'm very tired.

190
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:32,354
Then we can only accept your
recommendation by a unanimous vote.

191
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:36,526
Very well, we will have a vote
in our next session.

192
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:39,968
The members of the council
will need some time

193
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:42,888
for thoughts and reflection.

194
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:48,625
CLAPPING

195
00:14:57,281 --> 00:15:00,306
Where is Hamdani? I don't know.

196
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,895
Comrades...

197
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,502
it causes me great pain

198
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,736
that one of my first duties
as President

199
00:15:10,736 --> 00:15:15,116
is to tell you that we have
uncovered an atrocious plot

200
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:17,723
against our beloved Ba'ath Party.

201
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,625
You can end this now.

202
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,920
Just do what we need and confirm it.

203
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,386
My pain is not eased by the fact
that these collaborators

204
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:34,098
are sitting amongst us here.

205
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:37,853
Or...things can get worse.

206
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,565
The witness.

207
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,338
MURMURING

208
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:50,368
Now I want you to imagine
your daughter sitting

209
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,724
where you are sitting.

210
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:56,209
Imagine.

211
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:01,111
'Since 1975,'

212
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:05,179
I have been part of a Syrian plot

213
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:09,559
to overthrow both Comrade Saddam
and al-Bakr.

214
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:13,418
When we, the conspirators,

215
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:20,928
realised...that al-Bakr was to
step down in favour of his deputy,

216
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:25,308
the assumption of the presidency
by Comrade Saddam Hussein

217
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:30,001
forced us to put into action a plan
to remove him.

218
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:36,051
But as we did so,
we revealed ourselves

219
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:39,180
and our plans were uncovered.

220
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:47,106
MURMURING

221
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:50,339
Comrades, you can imagine
how stunned I was

222
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:55,450
to discover that I had been betrayed
by my closest colleagues.

223
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,100
When the first of the criminals
were arrested,

224
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,125
I asked them,

225
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:06,505
what political differences
are there between you and me?

226
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,174
Did you lack any power or money?

227
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:15,892
And if your opinion differed...
on anything,

228
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,500
why didn't you bring it
to the party?

229
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,757
They had...nothing to say
to defend themselves.

230
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:32,788
The people whose names are read out
should leave the hall.

231
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,568
Mohammed Ayesh.

232
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,966
Fouad Abdullah.

233
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,243
Amjid Haish.

234
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:51,979
HE CONTINUES READING NAMES

235
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,482
We have done nothing!
We have done nothing!

236
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,151
We are innocent.

237
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:59,697
We are innocent. This is all lies.

238
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:01,991
Go out!

239
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:04,495
I am innocent. Out!

240
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:07,206
Long live Saddam! God save Saddam!

241
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:10,127
CHEERING

242
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:12,213
Long live Saddam! Long live Saddam!

243
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:38,913
Mashhadi?

244
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,895
Fire.

245
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,809
Fire.

246
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:15,938
Fire.

247
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,024
Fire.

248
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,257
GUNSHOT
Fire!

249
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:43,786
My President,

250
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:46,497
I came as soon as I got
your message.

251
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,338
Is there something wrong?

252
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,995
Hamdani.

253
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,271
Forgive me.

254
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,817
You are always my friend.

255
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:16,431
I have nothing to forgive you for.

256
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,376
Mama?

257
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:42,818
Habibti, what is it?

258
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,382
Baba says he'll see you now.

259
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:50,849
Is it true that I am promised
to Mohammed?

260
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:54,395
Is it true? Mohammed is a good boy.

261
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:59,192
And when the time comes,
you must be a good daughter.

262
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,696
A good wife.

263
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:05,242
It's what your grandmother
Subha wants.

264
00:21:28,813 --> 00:21:30,794
He was your friend, Saddam.

265
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:36,844
His wife was my friend.

266
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:39,660
How am I supposed to face her?

267
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,789
What am I supposed to tell her?

268
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,457
I did...

269
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,212
..what was necessary.

270
00:21:57,286 --> 00:22:01,353
The man who can sacrifice
even his best friend

271
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:05,004
is the man without weakness.

272
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:11,888
In the eyes of my enemies...
I am stronger now.

273
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:32,017
MAN LAUGHS

274
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,416
Don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

275
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:37,023
Be respectful, and just listen.
Understand?

276
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,109
Yes. Hello.

277
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,404
Here come the al-Majids.

278
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,244
No women, gentlemen? No dancing?

279
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:52,668
What's the matter with you? You
should be making the most of life.
Tomorrow we could all be dead.

280
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,232
You're a funny man, Ali.

281
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:57,048
HE LAUGHS
Take a seat, Hussein.

282
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,281
So who saw it coming?

283
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:04,975
Hamdani?

284
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:07,895
Saddam.

285
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:09,772
You didn't know?

286
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:15,822
Did he tell you why? Only Saddam
knows what Saddam is thinking.

287
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:18,325
Only Saddam knows
what we're all thinking.

288
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:27,607
You believe that? If Saddam believes
it, that's all that matters.

289
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,485
Maybe he had a big mouth.

290
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:32,509
Maybe he couldn't handle his whisky.
The two don't mix.

291
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:35,430
Cousin, I'm simply talking,

292
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:38,037
amongst friends, amongst family.

293
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:40,853
Hamdani wasn't family. Be careful.

294
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,626
Nor am I.

295
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:47,215
Yeah, but you're a Christian,
Tariq. You're a threat
to no-one but yourself.

296
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:49,510
Hamdani was too clever
for his own good.

297
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:52,430
He's the past.

298
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:57,228
Tonight my friends, I'm getting
drunk, I'm getting laid,

299
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:00,252
and in the morning,
I won't remember a thing

300
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,755
except my loyalty
to our President.

301
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:05,884
Who is neither al-Majid
nor Ibrahim, but half and half.

302
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,977
Go fuck a donkey. Go.

303
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,167
HE LAUGHS

304
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,603
I can't do this.

305
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:57,094
SOBBING

306
00:25:08,254 --> 00:25:09,818
I loved him like a brother.

307
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:25,672
Hamdani, he and I spoke many times,
so many times...

308
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:30,469
about how we would put the nation
before our own needs.

309
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:36,623
Did he ever talk like that to you?

310
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:41,003
Yes.

311
00:25:41,003 --> 00:25:42,568
Always.

312
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,599
So I know in my heart...

313
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:56,335
..that he would have understood,

314
00:25:56,335 --> 00:26:01,341
that in my place,
he would have done the same.

315
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:10,519
What is good for Iraq...

316
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:12,710
is good for me.

317
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,299
He believed in you, Saddam.

318
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:21,262
He followed you in all things.

319
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:25,851
And so do I.

320
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,753
Tell me...

321
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:34,195
what I and my children...

322
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:38,158
can do to serve you and Iraq.

323
00:26:47,336 --> 00:26:50,674
PEOPLE CHANT: Saddam! Saddam!
Saddam! Saddam!

324
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,987
HE SINGS:

325
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:41,571
Why can't we go somewhere
where there are bigger animals?

326
00:27:41,571 --> 00:27:43,865
I'm tired of shooting little birds.

327
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:47,829
You hear that, Saddam? Your boy
wants to shoot something bigger.

328
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:50,645
If Qusay was here,
I could shoot him.

329
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:52,835
One day you'll shoot a lion, Uday.

330
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,737
This is the middle of nowhere.

331
00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:01,492
Tikrit is not the middle of nowhere.
Come. There's nothing here.

332
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,706
Mr President.

333
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,878
OK... You see?

334
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:14,007
He's yours.

335
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:16,510
Aim carefully.

336
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,179
Good.

337
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,744
His name is Khomeini.

338
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,271
GUNSHOT

339
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:26,523
LAUGHTER

340
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:29,443
Bastard.

341
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:31,321
Never mind. Never mind.

342
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:38,204
When I was a boy, if I missed,
it meant empty bellies for my family.

343
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,082
And a beating from my stepfather.

344
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:42,376
Come.

345
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:44,253
He was a bastard.

346
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,481
I don't know why we have to come
back to this godforsaken place.

347
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:01,567
It's home.

348
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,070
Be careful with that.

349
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,616
And this thing with the tent.

350
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:11,684
The entire wealth of the country
is ours, and what do we do?

351
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,039
We put up a tent!

352
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,586
HE LAUGHS
It's true, Adnan.

353
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:20,236
INSECT BUZZES

354
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:23,365
What's wrong
with going to London or Paris?

355
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,850
Make him happy, Sajida.

356
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,813
If Saddam's happy,
then it will be easier for me.

357
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,899
What do you mean?

358
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,506
I don't want him to rush into war.

359
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:39,635
He has his sights set on Khomeini.

360
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:41,617
Then speak plainly.

361
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:46,623
As long as my sister
is on my side, I will.

362
00:29:46,623 --> 00:29:50,586
Adnan, he loves you.

363
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,464
You are practically his brother.

364
00:29:53,402 --> 00:29:55,176
We took him in,

365
00:29:55,176 --> 00:29:59,452
we fed him,
we all grew up together.

366
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:02,372
He will listen to you.
He is President.

367
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:04,458
He will listen.

368
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:12,697
Be good to Subha.

369
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:16,035
It's hard to believe
but she still has influence.

370
00:30:16,035 --> 00:30:18,017
Look at her.

371
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:24,170
She doesn't like the way I dress,
can you believe it?

372
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,090
HE CHUCKLES

373
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,594
Shh.
HE LAUGHS

374
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:39,189
Look around you, Uday.

375
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:42,318
Look around.
The land between two rivers.

376
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:48,263
The first great armies and empires
were founded here.

377
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,705
Do you know the first laws
were written here?

378
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:56,919
We have the birthplace
of civilisation beneath our feet

379
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,840
and we will make it great again,
you and I.

380
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:05,055
We are lucky men, Uday.

381
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:08,705
We have a land to die for.

382
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:19,135
Baba. Mm? I'm hot.

383
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,515
Have you heard a word I've said?

384
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,018
You are your mother's son.

385
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,313
Of course you're hot,

386
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:30,295
we are in the desert.

387
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,859
Drink some water.

388
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:37,595
We are hunters.

389
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:41,559
HE MUTTERS
Come.

390
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:45,418
Next time maybe I'll bring Qusay.

391
00:32:56,757 --> 00:33:04,162
WOMAN:

392
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:36,911
He did well.

393
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,212
Your mother wants to talk to you.
She's inside.

394
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:47,863
Isn't that Tariq?

395
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:50,053
What does he want?

396
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:52,764
I'll be with her as soon as I can.
Tell her.

397
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:57,041
Barzan is already
interrogating him.

398
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,335
An agent of Iran?

399
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:02,047
No doubt. Son of a dog.

400
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:06,949
And in the south, Mohammed Bakr
al-Sadr and his Dawa Party

401
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:09,765
have now pledged
open allegiance to Khomeini.

402
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:15,188
Treason. I have my army units
at the ready, in case of uprising.

403
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:16,753
Iraq's army.

404
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,422
Of course.

405
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:24,575
Mohammed Bakr al-Sadr is one man.
It is Khomeini who is the problem.

406
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,581
Khomeini is a cause.

407
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:33,858
I struggle to see any option
but military.

408
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:35,422
We don't want to appear weak,

409
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:39,072
but would it be an idea
to seek the views of our allies,

410
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:41,263
both Arab and Western?

411
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:45,435
If there is to be war,
they will benefit,
so why shouldn't they contribute?

412
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:48,355
And they would like to protect
their supply of oil.

413
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:53,987
Of course. Access to information
from American satellites
would be a great advantage.

414
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:56,490
Providing we know our objective.

415
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,453
Our objective is to cut off
the head of the snake.

416
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:02,018
Excuse me.

417
00:35:09,214 --> 00:35:11,822
So it's war.

418
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:15,159
I don't understand.

419
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:20,166
You're holding counsel without
the people that really matter -
the Ibrahims.

420
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:22,460
Mama, we are hunting. And talking.

421
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,902
Where's Barzan?
Where's Sabawi? Watban?

422
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:27,779
They are busy. They should be here.

423
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:31,743
Ali Hassan al-Majid is here.

424
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:34,246
He brings his cousin, Hussein.

425
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:37,896
Who is also my cousin. Mama, what
do you want, in the name of Allah?

426
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:40,086
They are eager
to show their loyalty.

427
00:35:40,086 --> 00:35:42,172
They are eager
to make their fortunes.

428
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:45,301
It is your brothers
that should be always here

429
00:35:45,301 --> 00:35:47,909
beside you at the counsel.
Half-brothers.

430
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,037
And your elder son

431
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:53,958
has the grace of a pig.

432
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,357
And your wife allows it.

433
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:59,798
All the way here,
he did nothing but break wind.

434
00:35:59,798 --> 00:36:01,363
Uday is a boy, Mama.

435
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:06,369
What should I do, beat him?
Like Barzan's father did to me?

436
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:09,289
Drive him away from his home?

437
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:13,774
You have too much to say
to your mother.

438
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:15,547
Leave me.

439
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:17,112
I'm tired.

440
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:33,278
WOMAN:

441
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:52,781
GUNSHOT

442
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:00,604
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

443
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,272
SINGLE GUNSHOT

444
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:13,537
And cut!

445
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:15,518
MAN: And cut.

446
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:21,150
Very good. Impressive.
Is that what it was really like?

447
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,862
Well, in reality, the bullet hurt.

448
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:27,512
The film will cover
the early life of our President,

449
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:31,058
when he was fighting for
a free Iraq. It's for the people,

450
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,353
for the purposes of morale.

451
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:36,482
Saddam! What an honour.

452
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,740
You did well. Thank you.

453
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,034
These gentlemen
are from Time magazine.

454
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,537
Saddam Kamel.

455
00:37:47,537 --> 00:37:52,439
Remarkable resemblance, don't
you think? You're cousins, right?

456
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,795
That is correct.

457
00:37:53,795 --> 00:37:55,881
Saddam Kamel is my brother.

458
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:59,323
And you're Saddam
and you're Hussein?

459
00:37:59,323 --> 00:38:02,139
We have a lot to live up to.

460
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:04,851
Unbelievable.

461
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:07,667
We want to have good relations
with the US.

462
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,796
We want people in America
to understand

463
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:13,195
what has happened inside Iraq.

464
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:15,385
And is there opposition to the war

465
00:38:15,385 --> 00:38:18,201
from the Shia in your own country,
Mr President?

466
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:20,704
Ask the people directly.
Go into their homes.

467
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:23,729
See their love for their country.

468
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:25,502
And for their President.

469
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:29,256
No-one forces them to put pictures
of Saddam Hussein on their walls.

470
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,551
Still they choose to do that.

471
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:35,306
Is it true that the war
is going to bankrupt the economy?

472
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:38,122
These stories are lies.

473
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,312
Speak to the people.

474
00:38:40,312 --> 00:38:42,815
Ask them if they want for anything.

475
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:48,238
And what of the reports
of Iran's military success

476
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:51,054
forcing Iraqi troops
back to the borders?

477
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:55,852
Recently Iran has been receiving
foreign assistance.

478
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:59,398
But what about...?
As a country of principle,

479
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:02,944
we are fighting
a man of superficiality.

480
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:08,889
Principle will be the victim.
Do you think that the...?

481
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:12,748
Gentlemen, we have
something special to show you.

482
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:17,442
ALL:

483
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:32,982
Excellent.

484
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:36,632
You have worked very hard.

485
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:39,865
The children enjoy it very much.

486
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:42,577
Tell me...

487
00:39:42,577 --> 00:39:48,314
how many of you have fathers
or brothers in the army?

488
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:50,921
Oh!

489
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,320
Good. You should be proud.

490
00:39:54,676 --> 00:39:58,535
This girl looks like
my own daughter, Hala.

491
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:00,516
She is very pretty.

492
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:05,835
Tell me, when you are at home
with Baba and Mama,

493
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:08,964
what does Baba say about Saddam?

494
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:13,762
Anything at all?

495
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:21,167
Baba says, long live Saddam.

496
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:26,382
Beautiful. Thank you.

497
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,572
HE LAUGHS

498
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:30,032
Please...

499
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,640
Slow down.

500
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,898
I hope you have enjoyed your visit
as much as I have.

501
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:48,389
It would be wonderful
if you could visit us again soon.

502
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:53,291
I would like that.
I will arrange it.

503
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:09,457
Hussein is a good boy,
a good soldier.

504
00:41:09,457 --> 00:41:12,899
He'd never let you down.
He's loyal.

505
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:16,966
Yes. I like him. I'm pleased...
for the family.

506
00:41:16,966 --> 00:41:19,469
Kamel Hanna. Yes, Your Excellency.

507
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,015
Ask the lady to join us. Yes.

508
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:28,543
Hussein, stand on your head.

509
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:31,776
For the President.

510
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,721
HE LAUGHS
He would do it!

511
00:41:37,826 --> 00:41:39,494
For you, he would do anything.

512
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:46,587
Is that her?

513
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,568
She is pretty.

514
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:52,323
She is married. So what?

515
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:54,617
Mr President, we are honoured.

516
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:58,268
And I'm honoured
you're honoured. Please...

517
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:04,630
You look beautiful.

518
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,342
Sit here, next to me.

519
00:42:07,342 --> 00:42:09,636
Thank you.

520
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:20,796
And may I just...

521
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:24,655
..so I can see you.

522
00:42:26,428 --> 00:42:28,097
And I you.

523
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:31,643
Thank you for coming.

524
00:42:31,643 --> 00:42:33,416
We are honoured.

525
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,171
Yes, you said.

526
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:50,729
May I say that your wife
is very beautiful.

527
00:42:50,729 --> 00:42:53,963
You must love her very much. I do.

528
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:57,509
I think our President...

529
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,177
likes her.

530
00:43:00,742 --> 00:43:02,098
She's my wife.

531
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:06,165
..Beautiful.

532
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:11,380
I'd really do nothing,
if I were you.

533
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,031
There will be compensation.

534
00:43:34,013 --> 00:43:38,497
Why am I reading of Iranian
successes on the battlefield?

535
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:40,479
You would have been informed.

536
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:43,295
What else has been hidden from me?

537
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:47,780
Were you hiding it from me, Barzan?

538
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,387
No! No. A report has been prepared.

539
00:43:50,387 --> 00:43:54,142
Why did we fail at Al-Muhammarah?

540
00:43:54,142 --> 00:43:58,940
We were taking too many casualties,
and a withdrawal was ordered.

541
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,651
So our soldiers refused
to die for their country?

542
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:04,363
It was becoming a massacre,
Mr President.

543
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:09,161
It was a tactical decision
to fall back and regroup.

544
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:12,394
It was a coward's decision,
General Khairallah.

545
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:18,965
I want Colonel Ahmed al-Dulaimi
and General Jawad Shiatna executed.

546
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:20,842
They are two of our best.

547
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:22,928
Their decision was purely tactical.

548
00:44:22,928 --> 00:44:25,640
HE BANGS TABLE

549
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,830
The Iraqi Army

550
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,499
does not retreat!

551
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:32,523
Do you understand?

552
00:44:32,523 --> 00:44:34,714
Barzan...

553
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:40,971
summon the commanders in question and
oversee their execution, immediately.

554
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:45,352
Hussein, come with me.
Stand for the President!

555
00:44:57,555 --> 00:45:01,309
Hussein is like Saddam's
Siamese fucking twin.

556
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:04,438
He's doing his job, Barzan,
nothing more.

557
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:07,359
Yeah. He's doing something.

558
00:45:22,273 --> 00:45:24,255
How is she?

559
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:31,764
Barzan's with her.

560
00:45:31,764 --> 00:45:33,224
She's very weak.

561
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:00,967
Mama...

562
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:04,409
Barzan, leave us.

563
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:07,747
I want to talk to Saddam.

564
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,968
Your strength

565
00:46:17,968 --> 00:46:20,575
is in the family.

566
00:46:20,575 --> 00:46:23,391
Blood is permanent.

567
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:26,624
I want Raghad

568
00:46:26,624 --> 00:46:28,919
to marry Barzan's boy.

569
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,987
I want you to keep
the family together,

570
00:46:32,987 --> 00:46:34,968
my family.

571
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:38,410
Mama, why are you talking like this?

572
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:41,330
Keep Barzan close.

573
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:49,153
He was always loyal to you,
even when he was little.

574
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:51,134
You should...

575
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:53,325
You should rest, Mama.

576
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:54,993
Yes.

577
00:46:56,245 --> 00:46:59,165
It is a good thing

578
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:02,503
that you never knew your father.

579
00:47:07,613 --> 00:47:11,159
He was bad blood.

You...

585
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:42,970
gave me nothing.

LOW CHANTING

587
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:33,554
Saddam. She was proud of you...

588
00:48:33,554 --> 00:48:35,536
and of our strength as a family.

589
00:48:35,536 --> 00:48:38,247
As I am.

590
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,689
You should know, Barzan,

591
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:44,714
it was her wish before she died,

592
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:47,843
that Raghad should marry Hussein.

593
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:49,512
No!

594
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:53,683
to my son Mohammed for years.

595
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:58,481
It was her wish. No.

596
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:04,635
She thought it was time
to recognise my father's family.

597
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:06,929
She said that?

598
00:49:12,978 --> 00:49:17,985
Saddam, I've been loyal to you,
always, and now this insult,

599
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:21,218
not just to me
but to all the Ibrahims.

600
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:25,077
Please...

601
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:27,059
think of my honour.

602
00:50:04,397 --> 00:50:08,569
Hussein, the driver of this truck
is to be arrested.

603
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,863
Those coffins should be covered.

604
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:14,514
Mothers and wives do not need
to be reminded of their sacrifice.

605
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,600
Everything in the city
is to be normal.

606
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:25,361
Shouldn't we also be thinking
of other towns and cities?

607
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:28,698
Our soldiers come from all over.

608
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:32,661
What about the wives and mothers
of Mosul, Basra, Dujail?

609
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:35,269
Victory will heal everything.

610
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:37,563
Yes, victory
will bring rewards for all.

611
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:39,754
These places belong to the Shia.

612
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:41,422
You have to go to them.

613
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:47,263

They tried to kill me.
They tried to kill me.

We need to get you out of here.
No. We must go back.

To Dujail! Now.

Now!

These few shots won't frighten
the people of Iraq

636

Saddam Hussein.

637

We will find the assassins.

Hussein, how many rounds of
ammunition were fired at my cars?

644
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,801
My estimate is in excess of 300.

645

300 rounds.

One bullet.

648
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:06,054
Yet these traitors were given
300 opportunities to kill me.

649
00:54:06,054 --> 00:54:10,017
Yes, and they will be found
and punished.

I hear you're the second most
powerful man in Iraq, Barzan.

Some might say you have the most
to gain from my assassination.

No, no.

I want you to know, I would only
trust the happiness of my daughter

677
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:18,690
to a man who owes me everything.

678
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:22,967
Hussein is such a man.

679
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:25,678
He will be a good husband.

00:57:25,678 --> 00:57:27,138

that need to be said.

It is done. I have carried out
your orders to the letter.

684
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,102
Dujail has gone.

685
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:49,980
And it's my wedding gift to you.

686
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:54,569
Raghad, please...

687
00:58:02,495 --> 00:58:08,023
The traitors, their families,
their associates - all gone.

688
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:11,256
I know.
I'm ready to serve my President,

689
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:12,821
my brother.

690
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:21,373
From now on, Barzan, Hussein will be
responsible for my personal security.

691
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:27,839
He will be my son. I trust him.

692
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,968
We will talk more later.

693
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:32,533
No.

694
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:35,140
Why are you insulting me this way?

695
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,643
I have been loyal to you.

696
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:39,938
I have done everything
that you ask of me.

697
00:58:39,938 --> 00:58:43,275
I even accepted this wedding.

698
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:47,969
Saddam, by continuing
to favour the al-Majids

699
00:58:47,969 --> 00:58:50,889
you are surrounding yourself
with weakness.

700
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:55,061
They are not interested in Iraq.

701
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:57,981
Know your place, Barzan.

702
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:01,945
They are my blood. You understand?

703
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:07,159
And I know a traitor
before he knows himself.

704
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,331
I have given you my soul.

705
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:22,283
You will attend the wedding,
and then you will leave Iraq.

Cool, eh?

711
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,755
I've nothing to forgive you for.

712
01:03:01,755 --> 01:03:06,555
You should be making the most of
life. Tomorrow we could all be dead.

713
01:03:06,555 --> 01:03:15,111
This programme contains some
violent scenes and strong language.

714
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:16,989
Go out! Out!

715
01:03:19,806 --> 01:03:22,727
Is that her? She is pretty.

716
01:03:22,727 --> 01:03:24,397
She is married.

717

Hussein. Stand on your head...
For the President.

718
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,283
For you he would do anything.

719
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:44,848
Who is the blonde?

01:03:47,143 --> 01:03:48,813
Watch this, Qusay.

01:03:58,203 --> 01:04:04,255
I want you to know I'd only trust
the happiness of my daughter
to a man who owes me everything.

722
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:06,029
Hussein is such a man.

723
01:04:06,029 --> 01:04:08,429
He will be responsible

724
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,785
for my personal security.

725
01:04:18,445 --> 01:04:21,054
HORNS BEEP

726
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:25,227
EXOTIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYS

727
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,487
LAUGHTER

728
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:50,895
Come on, let's celebrate!

729
01:04:52,877 --> 01:04:56,321
GUNFIRE, SHATTERED GLASS, SCREAMING

730
01:04:57,468 --> 01:04:59,138
Get out!

731
01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:01,955
Get down.

732
01:05:01,955 --> 01:05:05,294
Hey, what's happened to the music?
Let's have some music.

733
01:05:05,294 --> 01:05:06,650
GUNFIRE

734
01:05:07,694 --> 01:05:09,572
Come on.

735
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:16,145
What's the matter with you?
We've just won a war.

736
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:17,815
MUSIC BEGINS AGAIN

737
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:20,215
DRUNKEN LAUGHTER

738
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:21,988
Dance, everybo-o-dy!

739
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:24,910
HE CONTINUES TO LAUGH

740
01:05:31,066 --> 01:05:33,257
Come on, let's celebrate!

741
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:42,856
Another great night for our little
prince of death. Yes, General.

742
01:06:14,785 --> 01:06:16,976
Mohammed Ghani!

743
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:26,053
May I present to
you...the Victory Arch.

744
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:27,931
It's a bit small.

745
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:33,774
No, no, Your Excellency,
this is just a model.

746
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:40,974
I'm joking.

747
01:06:40,974 --> 01:06:44,104
Tell me about your plans.

748
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:47,756
I see you have adapted my design.

749
01:06:47,756 --> 01:06:50,573
Only very, very slightly,
Your Excellency.

750
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:55,790
You see how the ground bursts open

751
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:00,799
and, from it, springs an arm
of power and determination.

752
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:03,303
But this is no ordinary arm.

753
01:07:03,303 --> 01:07:07,372
The arm of victory is none
other than the arm of our leader,

754
01:07:07,372 --> 01:07:12,485
President Saddam Hussein himself,
God preserve and watch over him.
Hmmm.

755
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,745
An exact replica
of Your Excellency's arm

756
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:24,901
enlarged 40 times and cast in
metal from the melted-down weapons
of Iraq's martyrs.

757
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:32,205
Nothing like it exists in the Arab
world, or anywhere else in the world
for that matter, Your Excellency.

758
01:07:32,205 --> 01:07:37,735
A fitting monument
for the martyred sons of Iraq.

759
01:07:38,883 --> 01:07:42,952
Indeed, but expensive,
Your Excellency.

760
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:50,778
Our victory over Iran
deserves nothing less.

761
01:07:50,778 --> 01:07:53,282
Good, good.

762
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:06,324
Where's my father?
He's up there, sir.

763
01:08:06,324 --> 01:08:10,498
Baba. Ah, at last, Kamel.
He would like the food served
at 12 o'clock tomorrow.

764
01:08:10,498 --> 01:08:13,106
No later. For how many?

765
01:08:13,106 --> 01:08:17,176
I don't know, 20,
including the President. Make plenty.

766
01:08:31,262 --> 01:08:33,974
Is Baba here?

767
01:08:33,974 --> 01:08:37,105
No, sir, your father has left.

768
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:39,087
Is he with the blonde?

769
01:08:40,235 --> 01:08:42,217
Is he with her now?

770
01:08:44,304 --> 01:08:46,495
Or is it a different whore?

771
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:51,608
She's been here, hasn't she?

772
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,224
You're Baba's little servant.

773
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:16,754
But Baba won't always be President.

774
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,857
I know...

775
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:31,883
..you bring her here.

776
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:36,579
I know...

777
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:40,961
you arrange their meetings.

778
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:42,526
You're a pimp.

779
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:48,160
For my mother...

780
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:51,708
..I will kill you.

781
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:58,490
For my father...

782
01:10:00,472 --> 01:10:02,142
..I'll let you live.

783
01:10:16,437 --> 01:10:20,610
We can remove the cast now, if
Your Excellency will permit it. Yes.

784
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:29,896
We fought on Kuwait's behalf.

785
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:32,401
They share in our victory.

786
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:35,948
They are supposed to be our brothers.

787
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:42,313
I estimate that Kuwait's increase
in oil production has driven
down the prices per barrel by 20%.

788
01:10:42,313 --> 01:10:44,608
At a time when Iraq
needs every dollar to rebuild.

789
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,573
Wipeout.

790
01:10:48,573 --> 01:10:51,599
Who wins? Who buys the oil?

791
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:56,294
It's not just about the price of oil.
There is more to it.

792
01:10:59,842 --> 01:11:02,346
Raise... Argh! So sorry, Excellency!

793
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:03,911
OK, my fault, my fault.

794
01:11:03,911 --> 01:11:06,415
Raise the issue
at the next OPEC meeting.

795
01:11:06,415 --> 01:11:10,276
I want the other nations
to hear our complaint. Of course.

796
01:11:10,276 --> 01:11:12,467
Excellent, Your Excellency!

797
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:14,137
Excellent!

798
01:11:14,137 --> 01:11:17,789
Do you know they are talking
about the possibility of sanctions.

799
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:21,962
We'll talk about it at lunch. You
are invited to lunch with my family.

800
01:11:21,962 --> 01:11:24,884
Mr President, I have first
the meetings... Bring an appetite.

801
01:11:24,884 --> 01:11:28,327
If I have to suffer,
so does my deputy.

802
01:11:30,622 --> 01:11:34,066
Qusay, at lunch,
be sure to tell your father

803
01:11:34,066 --> 01:11:38,552
I am not behind these articles
praising me in the newspapers.
Please.

804
01:11:38,552 --> 01:11:43,352
The victory over Iran belongs
to the President, and no-one else.

805
01:11:43,352 --> 01:11:47,734
General Rashid,
my father understands that
the press have pages to fill.

806
01:11:47,734 --> 01:11:51,803
You are a hero, Papa. Sahar, I'm
a soldier, like any other soldier.

807
01:11:51,803 --> 01:11:53,682
I'll speak to Baba about it.

808
01:11:53,682 --> 01:11:56,603
Anyway, don't worry,
you are family now.

809
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,377
Mustapha's grandpa.

810
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,429
Habibti, we really have to go.

811
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:06,098
Raghad.

812
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:08,081
Raghad. Yalla.

813
01:12:08,081 --> 01:12:10,689
Hussein, this is silly.
We're going to be so early.

814
01:12:10,689 --> 01:12:16,323
I want to make sure I
get a seat next to your father
before your idiot brother does.

815
01:12:16,323 --> 01:12:19,871
Don't let Baba hear you talk
about Uday that way.

816
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:33,853
It suits you. You're my brother.
You have to say nice things.

817
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:39,696
If Saddam doesn't see it,
he's either a liar or blind.
It suits you.

818
01:12:57,538 --> 01:13:00,668
I thought the children
might have been here, Raghad.

819
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:05,155
They're at school, Baba.
I don't get to see enough of them.

820
01:13:05,155 --> 01:13:10,580
I could arrange another lunch -
just you, me and the grandchildren.

821
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:15,484
Maybe. It would be fun,
the children would love it.

822
01:13:15,484 --> 01:13:21,640
Ali. Tariq is concerned about Iraq's
reputation at the United Nations.

823
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,397
Yes. They are questioning
the operation against the Kurds,

824
01:13:25,397 --> 01:13:30,614
in particular at Halabja.
It was war. What do they expect us
to do in war? Send flowers?

825
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:35,831
They are calling it genocide.
Genocide? All because
I killed a few Kurds?

826
01:13:35,831 --> 01:13:38,752
No, Ali,
it is because you enjoyed it.

827
01:13:38,752 --> 01:13:42,508
And this is supposed
to be a family occasion.

828
01:13:42,508 --> 01:13:44,178
And we are government.

829
01:13:45,952 --> 01:13:49,604
America knows about our
use of chemical weapons.

830
01:13:49,604 --> 01:13:53,673
And still their foreign
policy favours Iraq.

831
01:13:53,673 --> 01:13:58,577
Why would they? They recognise
Iraq as the leading Arab nation.

832
01:13:58,577 --> 01:14:01,081
Agreed.

833
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:08,385
I think all our soldiers are all
very courageous. Don't you, Qusay?

834
01:14:10,889 --> 01:14:15,167
I have also noted that the United
Nations... Forget the UN, Tariq.

835
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,654
Kuwait is our priority.

836
01:14:19,654 --> 01:14:23,619
If the price of oil continues
to drop, there will be no economy

837
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:25,914
and therefore nothing
for the UN to sanction.

838
01:14:25,914 --> 01:14:29,044
We should take them out,
Baba, they are tiny.

839
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:32,592
A leader must be
prepared to negotiate, Uday.

840
01:14:32,592 --> 01:14:35,305
And one day you'll be leader.

841
01:14:42,504 --> 01:14:44,695
You've changed your hair.

842
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:47,930
Do you like it?

843
01:14:49,599 --> 01:14:52,312
It's blonde.
If you like it, I like it.

844
01:14:52,312 --> 01:14:56,590
Whatever makes you happy.
But do you like it?

845
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:03,790
It looks cheap.

846
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:07,963
Baba! It does not. It looks nice.

847
01:15:07,963 --> 01:15:10,676
Sajida,

848
01:15:10,676 --> 01:15:14,954
I'm not an expert,
but I think it looks very nice.

849
01:15:14,954 --> 01:15:16,623
I've had enough.

850
01:15:21,214 --> 01:15:23,405
Excuse me.

851
01:15:59,403 --> 01:16:03,368
There was a time
when we had a river.

852
01:16:03,368 --> 01:16:06,602
It was our playground
and our larder.

853
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:11,193
Times change.

854
01:16:11,193 --> 01:16:13,489
Sajida misses you.

855
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:15,471
She's still my wife, Adnan.

856
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:19,019
That's what she misses.
Being your wife.

857
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:22,358
She has everything she's ever
wished for. And she has you.

858
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:24,862
I'm not her husband.

859
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:27,262
I can't, Adnan.

860
01:16:27,262 --> 01:16:29,453
I have taken a new wife.

861
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:31,331
Samira.

862
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:33,313
Yes, Samira.

863
01:16:33,313 --> 01:16:36,548
If you wish, tell your sister.

864
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:39,887
Personally, I didn't want to
cause her unnecessary pain.

865
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:44,582
When you address me in future, Adnan,
remember I am your president.

866
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:49,486
I came as a friend, Mr President.

867
01:16:49,486 --> 01:16:52,199
Not as commander of your army.

868
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:58,459
But you may wish to know that
your army also feel neglected.

869
01:16:58,459 --> 01:17:03,885
They have fought for peace and they
want to return to their families.

870
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,285
But we have no money to pay them.

871
01:17:07,641 --> 01:17:13,276
One million men, Mr President,
all waiting to be told what to do.

872
01:17:16,197 --> 01:17:21,310
But the truth is not what
you want to hear. Adnan! Wait!

873
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:23,084
Wait.

874
01:17:28,718 --> 01:17:31,640
I know what you say is true.

875
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,709
I will feed my army and my country.

876
01:17:35,709 --> 01:17:41,135
But I cannot give to Sajida
what isn't there any more. I'm sorry.

877
01:17:41,135 --> 01:17:43,534
She's your sister.

878
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,621
I hope you understand.

879
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:10,454
Happy birthday.

880
01:18:12,124 --> 01:18:14,002
Thank you.

881
01:18:15,254 --> 01:18:18,071
Madam! How can I help you?

882
01:18:19,114 --> 01:18:21,619
He married her.

883
01:18:21,619 --> 01:18:25,062
You knew before I knew.

884
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:29,027
A servant. Never look at me again.

885
01:18:29,027 --> 01:18:33,409
Yes, madam. I mean, no, madam.
Never speak to me.

886
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:50,938
How would you describe
the mood of the people, Hussein?

887
01:18:52,086 --> 01:18:55,634
Hm? The people?

888
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:57,199
The people.

889
01:18:58,972 --> 01:19:00,746
They are happy.

890
01:19:00,746 --> 01:19:03,146
Joyful that the war is over.

891
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:05,441
They're optimistic.

892
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:09,198
Iraq has a bright future
ahead of it.

893
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:12,537
With a great leader.

894
01:19:12,537 --> 01:19:16,293
Hmm. What is their
view of General Khairallah?

895
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,380
Many see him as the perfect soldier.

896
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,301
An intelligent warrior capable
of leading from the front.

897
01:19:21,301 --> 01:19:24,014
And who are these many?

898
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:27,979
His fellow officers.
The men he commands.

899
01:19:27,979 --> 01:19:31,422
Men like Qusay's
father-in-law, General Rashid.

900
01:19:31,422 --> 01:19:33,613
They would follow
him into any battle.

901
01:19:33,613 --> 01:19:37,370
And since the war with Iran, he even
has the affection of the people.

902
01:19:39,769 --> 01:19:42,795
Not more than the President,
of course.

903
01:19:42,795 --> 01:19:48,325
An army's loyalty should be to Iraq,
not to an individual commander.

904
01:19:49,995 --> 01:19:53,647
What happens if the commander
falls at battle?

905
01:19:53,647 --> 01:19:55,733
You are right.

906
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:58,029
The Kuwaiti problem may escalate.

907
01:20:00,116 --> 01:20:04,185
I need to be sure of everybody.

908
01:20:14,932 --> 01:20:18,167
Good group. I keep my eye in.

909
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:24,531
Are you not shooting, Hussein?
I am here to assist the President.

910
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:30,374
And how is the President?
He has traitors on his mind.

911
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:35,278
Kuwait.

912
01:20:37,052 --> 01:20:41,539
A betrayal by brother Arabs
is difficult to stomach.

913
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:43,730
Agreed.

914
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:47,591
You are the voice
he trusts most, Adnan.

915
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:50,408
You are practically his brother.

916
01:20:50,408 --> 01:20:53,851
What of it?
He needs you at his shoulder.

917
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:57,503
Is there room for both of us,
Hussein?

918
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:01,155
I'm still learning.

919
01:21:05,224 --> 01:21:08,041
Good shooting.

920
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,606
Hmm.

921
01:21:15,032 --> 01:21:17,745
'Iraq's muscle-flexing in the Gulf

922
01:21:17,745 --> 01:21:21,084
'has dominated the OPEC
oil minister's talks in Geneva.

923
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:24,318
'Iraq hasn't succeeded in getting
the full price rise it wanted,

924
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:28,283
'but an increase to around
$20 a barrel is likely.'

925
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:32,040
Here comes Kuwait.

926
01:21:34,648 --> 01:21:37,778
The last man to rob me
had the grace to wear a mask.

927
01:21:43,204 --> 01:21:50,090
My President has asked me to
register his disappointment
to our brothers from Kuwait.

928
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:56,455
Kuwaiti greed and overproduction
cost us all dearly.

929
01:21:58,438 --> 01:22:02,194
This is money
Iraq can ill afford to lose.

930
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:06,993
But, gentlemen,
it is my sad duty to reveal

931
01:22:06,993 --> 01:22:11,793
that greed is not the limit
of our complaint against Kuwait.

932
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,819
We have discovered
something more sinister.

933
01:22:15,967 --> 01:22:17,219
Please.

934
01:22:20,558 --> 01:22:24,836
We have discovered that the Kuwaitis
have been using American technology

935
01:22:24,836 --> 01:22:29,322
to slant drill into oilfields
under Iraq's sovereign territory.

936
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:35,687
Extraction of this oil
is nothing less than theft
of our natural resources.

937
01:22:37,878 --> 01:22:43,930
I am disappointed to see
that our Kuwaiti brothers
appear amused and unconcerned.

938
01:22:45,912 --> 01:22:49,877
Nevertheless, we look forward
to an overdue apology

939
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:54,364
and we demand an immediate end
to this shameful practice.

940
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,424
I can't believe he
actually married her.

941
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:15,649
What if he married her
because she was pregnant?

942
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:20,240
What if they have a son?

943
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:23,997
He would be first-born.
Don't be stupid, Uday.

944
01:23:23,997 --> 01:23:27,440
You are first-born.
In this family, yes.

945
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:31,405
Not in his new family.
He doesn't have a new family.

946
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:34,222
We're the only family.
We're the only sons.

947
01:23:36,622 --> 01:23:40,065
So, he has a second wife.
It happens.

948
01:23:40,065 --> 01:23:42,360
She's a whore.
She's a beautiful whore.

949
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,760
Have you seen her? Zaki, shut it!

950
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,412
Go and see
where all that noise is coming from.

951
01:23:58,638 --> 01:24:00,724
MUSIC BLARES, ENTHUSIASTIC CHEERING

952
01:24:00,724 --> 01:24:06,776
Looks like some party at one of the
guest houses over on the island.
Must be Kamel Hanna.

953
01:24:06,776 --> 01:24:09,280
GUNFIRE

954
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,410
The little shit!
He'll keep me awake all night.

955
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,080
Come on, Zaki.

956
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,897
Uday! Let it go.

957
01:24:16,897 --> 01:24:19,297
Zaki, keep an eye on him.

MUSIC STOPS

959
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:48,930
This party...is over.

960
01:24:52,477 --> 01:24:55,920
You must all go home.

961
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,198
I said, you must all go home! Uday!

962
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:02,181
Sir...

963
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:07,189
We have the President's blessing
for this party, so we are
entitled to enjoy it.

964
01:25:10,215 --> 01:25:13,345
Why don't you leave us alone...sir?

965
01:25:14,493 --> 01:25:17,101
How dare you speak to me like that?

966
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:19,293
Get off there! Get down!

967
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:27,431
I was trying to be
respectful and polite, sir...

968
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:29,101
but I am very drunk.

969
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,587
I can barely see you.

970
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:35,570
GUESTS LAUGH

971
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:39,013

you fucking whoremonger!

Stop! Please! It's not worth it!

975
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:06,663
You killed him! You killed him, Uday!

976
01:26:06,663 --> 01:26:10,628
I can't believe you did it! Oh,
shut the fuck up! What's happened?

977
01:26:10,628 --> 01:26:13,862
Zaki keeps saying that I killed
Kamel Hanna. You did! Did I?

978
01:26:13,862 --> 01:26:16,888
What do you mean, "Did I?"
You either killed him or you didn't.

979
01:26:16,888 --> 01:26:19,810
You must know. He killed him!
How the fuck do you know?

980
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:22,940
You got his fucking brains
all over your stick! Oh, shit!

981
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:26,383
So what if I killed him, huh?
But he belongs to Baba.

982
01:26:26,383 --> 01:26:31,392
He trusted him and Baba trusts
no-one. You know that! I'm
telling you, this is very serious!

983
01:26:31,392 --> 01:26:33,687
Zaki was there,
tell him he provoked me.

984
01:26:33,687 --> 01:26:37,026
We'll get witnesses
to say he provoked me.

PHONE RINGS

986
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:40,991
Leave it!

987
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,669
Yes?

988
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:50,695
Who is this? 'It's Qusay, Hussein.
What do you want?'

989
01:26:50,695 --> 01:26:54,138
Tell him to fuck off!
Mind his own fucking business!

990
01:26:54,138 --> 01:26:56,016
'Tell me it is not true.'

991
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:58,103
No. It's true. Fuck off, Qusay!

992
01:26:58,103 --> 01:27:00,711
Have you told your father?
'Not yet.'

993
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:02,276
OK.

994
01:27:02,276 --> 01:27:04,572
I will deal with it. No. No, no.

995
01:27:04,572 --> 01:27:07,702
You tell me where Baba is sleeping
and I will deal with it...

996
01:27:10,206 --> 01:27:11,145
Shit!

997
01:27:15,006 --> 01:27:19,179
Shit! Baba is going to kill me!
Uday! What do you think
you are doing now?

998
01:27:19,179 --> 01:27:20,640
Uday!

999
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,987
Uday! Fuck! Open the door! Fuck!

1000
01:27:28,987 --> 01:27:32,952
Uday! Fuck!
Open the door! I mean it!

1001
01:27:32,952 --> 01:27:35,665
Open the door or I'll kick it in.
Fuck!

1002
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:38,169
Uday!

1003
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:41,091
Shit!

1004
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,785
HE SPLUTTERS

1005
01:27:57,785 --> 01:28:00,081
LOUD THUMP

1006
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:04,046
Uday! Are you OK?

1007
01:28:08,219 --> 01:28:12,602
Baba, they made me puke... Saddam,
he knows what he did was wrong.

1008
01:28:12,602 --> 01:28:16,149
I want to speak to my son alone.
We have to deal with this properly.

1009
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:18,236
Everybody but my idiot son out!

1010
01:28:18,236 --> 01:28:20,114
Baba, I swear it was an accident!

1011
01:28:20,114 --> 01:28:22,201
I didn't mean to kill him.

1012
01:28:23,036 --> 01:28:24,705
I am so sorry.

1013
01:28:25,853 --> 01:28:27,001
Hussein!

1014
01:28:28,670 --> 01:28:34,096
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't cut you into pieces.

1015
01:28:34,096 --> 01:28:36,600
One reason! I have no reason.

1016
01:28:37,852 --> 01:28:42,652
You think violence is a pastime?!

1017
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:47,660
It is a tool! What are we?!

1018
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:51,938
Barbarians?! Hussein! Excellency.

1019
01:28:51,938 --> 01:28:56,633
I want to know everything
my son has done. Everything!

1020
01:28:56,633 --> 01:28:58,303
And put him in a cell!

1021
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:02,163
HE TUTS
Little prince,
you have really done it this time.

1022
01:29:09,676 --> 01:29:11,867
He's a spiteful child!

1023
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:14,580
I can't believe
he killed Kamel Hanna!

1024
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:16,875
I beat him, Samira,

1025
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:19,484
like my stepfather beat me.

1026
01:29:21,362 --> 01:29:25,535
You are not your stepfather.

1027
01:29:25,535 --> 01:29:28,353
You are not your father.

1028
01:29:28,353 --> 01:29:30,752
You are Saddam Hussein.

1029
01:29:32,944 --> 01:29:36,283
You had good reason to beat him.

1030
01:29:40,978 --> 01:29:43,586
You are the father of the nation.

1031
01:29:45,151 --> 01:29:49,116
You have to feed us, protect us,

1032
01:29:49,116 --> 01:29:50,681
and love us.

1033
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,959
And in return, we love you too.

1034
01:30:13,219 --> 01:30:20,940
I'm afraid this type of behaviour
seems to be normal for Uday.

1035
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:24,801
He drinks alcohol,
he is violent in public places...

1036
01:30:24,801 --> 01:30:26,679
That's enough.

1037
01:30:30,435 --> 01:30:33,878
Sons are not always
like their fathers.

1038
01:30:33,878 --> 01:30:35,965
But he is still young.

1039
01:30:35,965 --> 01:30:39,617
He brings shame too often
to your house, Saddam.

1040
01:30:39,617 --> 01:30:41,391
He is still my son.

1041
01:30:41,391 --> 01:30:44,938
He is opening the door
for a challenge to the President.

1042
01:30:44,938 --> 01:30:46,817
A challenge from where?

1043
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:53,077
From those who feel that
Uday's behaviour is typical of
this family and this government.

1044
01:30:53,077 --> 01:30:57,877
The war with Iran has all but
brought us to our knees.

1045
01:30:57,877 --> 01:30:59,963
We are a tired nation.

1046
01:30:59,963 --> 01:31:04,137
The war with Iran
has raised Iraq to new heights!

1047
01:31:04,137 --> 01:31:09,771
Only Iraq and its president
stood up to Khomeini.

1048
01:31:09,771 --> 01:31:12,380
We haven't been weakened by war,

1049
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:15,614
we've been enhanced by war!

1050
01:31:15,614 --> 01:31:18,745
Blessed by victory!

1051
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,588
Does the army disagree, General?

1052
01:31:24,588 --> 01:31:28,344
Are there Kabals
who are no longer loyal?

1053
01:31:28,344 --> 01:31:32,518
Is that what you are saying? Loyalty
of the Army is not in question here.

1054
01:31:32,518 --> 01:31:37,526
So who is it that dares to challenge
the President, Adnan?

1055
01:31:39,613 --> 01:31:43,265
Tell me. As a brother.

1056
01:31:46,082 --> 01:31:49,003
The matter in hand is Uday.

1057
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:54,325
I do not wish to see him harmed.

1058
01:31:54,325 --> 01:31:58,290
But he is not a leader.

1059
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,794
Hussein?

1060
01:32:00,794 --> 01:32:03,194
Do you have an opinion?

1061
01:32:04,863 --> 01:32:07,158
I may agree with you, Adnan,

1062
01:32:07,158 --> 01:32:11,228
that Uday's behaviour brings
a degree of shame to this house.

1063
01:32:11,228 --> 01:32:16,236
But in all honesty,
my opinion does not matter.

1064
01:32:16,236 --> 01:32:23,331
I could never presume
to place myself
in the shoes of our President.

1065
01:32:23,331 --> 01:32:24,792
Never.

1066
01:32:24,792 --> 01:32:26,461
Hm.

1067
01:32:38,982 --> 01:32:41,591
DOOR SLAMS

1068
01:32:58,077 --> 01:33:00,163
GUN IS COCKED

1069
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:23,223
What am I to do about the Kurds?

1070
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:32,196
Neither Arab or Iraqi...

1071
01:33:33,865 --> 01:33:37,517
..loyal only to themselves.

1072
01:33:37,517 --> 01:33:39,291
And what about America?

1073
01:33:41,169 --> 01:33:43,047
Should I say,

1074
01:33:43,047 --> 01:33:46,282
"Thank you, Mr Bush"?

1075
01:33:46,282 --> 01:33:50,768
"Thank you for your credits.

1076
01:33:50,768 --> 01:33:52,751
"For the rise in grain.

1077
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:56,194
"For your letters of friendship"?

1078
01:33:56,194 --> 01:34:00,994
Or do I scream at them
for collaborating with Kuwait?

1079
01:34:00,994 --> 01:34:05,167
For squeezing the life
out of my country.

1080
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:12,471
And what of my own people?

1081
01:34:16,019 --> 01:34:21,549
Do I spend our dollars on education,
and leave us open to attack?

1082
01:34:23,844 --> 01:34:27,287
Do I invest in weapons in the Army?

1083
01:34:30,418 --> 01:34:35,426
Maybe I should
forget my responsibilities,

1084
01:34:35,426 --> 01:34:38,869
and drink and whore, like my son.

1085
01:34:40,852 --> 01:34:43,251
Tell me why you should live or die?

1086
01:34:45,025 --> 01:34:47,634
Tell me why.

1087
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:51,494
Because I'm sorry.

1088
01:34:53,059 --> 01:34:54,312
Because I'm your son.

1089
01:34:57,129 --> 01:35:00,155
HE COCKS GUN
Baba...

1090
01:35:00,155 --> 01:35:02,137
I swear.

1091
01:35:03,598 --> 01:35:06,311
Nothing like this will happen again.

1092
01:35:06,311 --> 01:35:08,397
Never. I swear.

1093
01:35:08,397 --> 01:35:13,093
You are supposed to be my heir.

1094
01:35:13,093 --> 01:35:14,449
Baba...!

1095
01:35:14,449 --> 01:35:17,162
HIS VOICE BEGINS TO FALTER
I'm sorry!

1096
01:35:17,162 --> 01:35:19,249
I promise I'll be good!

1097
01:35:20,918 --> 01:35:23,214
I'm sorry.

1098
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:29,370
Yes.

1099
01:35:31,561 --> 01:35:33,022
You're sorry.

1100
01:35:45,543 --> 01:35:48,255
Wh...What's Baba going to do?

1101
01:35:48,255 --> 01:35:50,864
Worried, little prince?

1102
01:35:50,864 --> 01:35:53,785
You're no longer important.

1103
01:36:37,295 --> 01:36:39,069
Yalla.

1104
01:37:13,814 --> 01:37:16,527
Gentlemen, I have sad news
for all of us.

1105
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:25,083
It concerns a dear friend
and a brave soldier.

1106
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:25,188
It is with regret
that I have to inform you

1107
01:37:25,188 --> 01:37:27,796
of the death of our comrade and
friend, General Adnan Khairallah.

1108
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,169
How?

1109
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:41,256
How did he die?

1110
01:37:42,091 --> 01:37:44,177
I was informed

1111
01:37:44,177 --> 01:37:46,056
just over an hour ago.

1112
01:37:48,977 --> 01:37:50,960
A helicopter accident.

1113
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,655
We will all miss him greatly.

1114
01:37:55,655 --> 01:37:58,055
Some weeks ago...

1115
01:37:59,724 --> 01:38:02,750
..Adnan advised me of unrest
within the Army.

1116
01:38:05,150 --> 01:38:09,532
I've invited you here today
to allow you to voice any opinion

1117
01:38:09,532 --> 01:38:14,540
or grievances you may have,
or might have heard. The floor...

1118
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:16,419
is yours.

1119
01:38:34,574 --> 01:38:38,330
We face betrayal by Kuwait.

1120
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:43,234
Now is not the time for disharmony.

1121
01:38:44,382 --> 01:38:46,051
General Rashid.

1122
01:38:48,242 --> 01:38:52,416
Your Excellency. Please leave
the room by the door behind you.

1123
01:38:57,529 --> 01:38:59,615
Now, General, please.

1124
01:39:03,476 --> 01:39:07,858
I demand absolute loyalty
from my generals.

1125
01:39:09,632 --> 01:39:11,406
Your Excellency,

1126
01:39:11,406 --> 01:39:16,519
I think I speak on behalf
of all of us gathered here.

1127
01:39:16,519 --> 01:39:22,466
You have our undying loyalty...
and love.

1128
01:39:38,326 --> 01:39:43,438
Does Mama know about Adnan? Not yet.

1129
01:39:44,899 --> 01:39:48,655
How did it happen, Baba?
I don't know.

1130
01:39:51,368 --> 01:39:53,142
And General Rashid?

1131
01:39:56,585 --> 01:39:59,089
What do I tell my Sahar?

1132
01:39:59,089 --> 01:40:00,967
You tell her the truth.

1133
01:40:04,828 --> 01:40:08,271
You tell her that her father
has been placed under house arrest,

1134
01:40:08,271 --> 01:40:12,132
and that will not change
as long as I am President.

1135
01:40:12,132 --> 01:40:14,740
Of course.

1136
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:19,018
I understand.

1137
01:40:22,044 --> 01:40:23,922
I'm your servant.

1138
01:40:39,365 --> 01:40:41,765
I have to see him.
You won't be allowed.

1139
01:40:41,765 --> 01:40:45,834
I am his daughter! It is forbidden.
He is to have no visitors. Not yet.

1140
01:40:45,834 --> 01:40:48,547
You are the President's son.
Do something! I can't.

1141
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:58,772
What are you doing? Going to
my father's house. You can't.

1142
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,946
You are going nowhere. Stop it.

1143
01:41:02,946 --> 01:41:05,658
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Do something! Stop it!

1144
01:41:05,658 --> 01:41:09,728
SHE SOBS

1145
01:41:09,728 --> 01:41:10,875
Stop it.

1146
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:13,171
Stop it.

1147
01:41:26,109 --> 01:41:28,405
You think you can
just do as you please?

1148
01:41:30,909 --> 01:41:33,100
You can't.

1149
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,917
You're my wife.

1150
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:38,108
And that makes you...

1151
01:41:38,108 --> 01:41:39,673
my father's daughter.

1152
01:41:43,012 --> 01:41:45,308
Don't you understand
what that means?

1153
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:50,316
Cause trouble...

1154
01:41:50,316 --> 01:41:51,881
and your father will pay.

1155
01:41:54,698 --> 01:41:56,159
Accept it.

1156
01:42:09,306 --> 01:42:12,228
Here he is, children.

1157
01:42:12,228 --> 01:42:14,106
Your hero father.

1158
01:42:15,775 --> 01:42:18,801
Your hero grandfather,

1159
01:42:18,801 --> 01:42:22,244
hiding behind his desk,
in his uniform.

1160
01:42:25,166 --> 01:42:27,252
Sajida, what do you want?

1161
01:42:27,252 --> 01:42:31,113
Tell them why.

1162
01:42:31,113 --> 01:42:33,304
Tell them why you killed my brother.

1163
01:42:35,182 --> 01:42:37,791
Tell them!

1164
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:39,043
Tell me!

1165
01:42:41,443 --> 01:42:45,303
Raghad. Please show your mother
to her rooms.

1166
01:42:46,555 --> 01:42:48,955
Adnan was your friend.

1167
01:42:48,955 --> 01:42:54,694
He loved you and you needed him!

1168
01:42:57,929 --> 01:43:01,893
Now look what you're left with.

1169
01:43:01,893 --> 01:43:03,980
Men who are nothing,

1170
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:06,171
but afraid of you!

1171
01:43:09,615 --> 01:43:15,040
Adnan was killed
in a tragic accident.

1172
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:19,214
I am sorry. Accidents
do not happen in Iraq any more.

1173
01:43:22,970 --> 01:43:26,726
Sajida. Go shopping.

1174
01:43:30,274 --> 01:43:34,448
Come on, Mama. Let's go.

1175
01:43:44,047 --> 01:43:48,742
At this meeting of the Arab League
nothing can be left to chance.

1176
01:43:48,742 --> 01:43:55,524
We need to remind the Emir that
he is an Arab, not a Texas cowboy.

1177
01:44:13,575 --> 01:44:20,253
I wouldn't want there to be
any misunderstanding between us.

1178
01:44:20,253 --> 01:44:25,992
By driving down the price of oil, you
are declaring economic war on Iraq.

1179
01:44:28,183 --> 01:44:30,478
As one Arab to another...

1180
01:44:32,148 --> 01:44:34,130
..I am asking you to stop.

1181
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:37,678
Saddam Hussein. If you do not...

1182
01:44:39,347 --> 01:44:41,956
..we will have to defend our honour.

1183
01:44:44,564 --> 01:44:48,112
You think you can intimidate me?

1184
01:44:48,112 --> 01:44:51,764
You think you have powerful friends?

1185
01:44:51,764 --> 01:44:55,624
But you are not the only one
with powerful friends.

1186
01:44:57,294 --> 01:45:01,050
Salaamu Alaikum,
Saddam Hussein Al-Tikriti.

1187
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:04,285
Salaamu Alaikum.

1188
01:45:15,866 --> 01:45:20,040
Ambassador, I have
summoned you here to ask

1189
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,483
what does it mean
when America says it will...

1190
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:25,257
protect Kuwait?

1191
01:45:26,926 --> 01:45:31,726
It can only mean
prejudice against Iraq.

1192
01:45:31,726 --> 01:45:37,360
We understand that the United States
wants to secure the flow of oil.

1193
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,282
But it must not use methods

1194
01:45:40,282 --> 01:45:44,038
which it says it disapproves of.

1195
01:45:44,038 --> 01:45:48,316
If we feel that
you want to injure our pride...

1196
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:56,559
..then we will cease to care
and death will be our choice.

1197
01:45:56,559 --> 01:46:00,524
Mr President,
you speak of friendship

1198
01:46:00,524 --> 01:46:04,906
and I believe it is clear
from the letters President Bush
has sent to you

1199
01:46:04,906 --> 01:46:08,871
that we value our friendship
with Iraq extremely highly.

1200
01:46:10,019 --> 01:46:13,671
I know you need funds
to rebuild your country

1201
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:18,366
but we have no opinion
on Arab-Arab conflict

1202
01:46:18,366 --> 01:46:22,957
like your
border disagreement with Kuwait.

1203
01:46:22,957 --> 01:46:25,357
No opinion?

1204
01:46:25,357 --> 01:46:28,278
That's correct.

1205
01:46:28,278 --> 01:46:33,182
However, I would like to stress
our President's strong desire

1206
01:46:33,182 --> 01:46:36,626
for peace and stability
in the Middle East.

1207
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:41,947
Tariq, she backed down. So?

1208
01:46:41,947 --> 01:46:43,616
How was the meeting?

1209
01:46:43,616 --> 01:46:47,164
These things are
always difficult to read.

1210
01:46:47,164 --> 01:46:50,816
She expressed no opinion
on Arab-Arab conflicts.

1211
01:46:50,816 --> 01:46:55,303
The big collaborators have been
found out and they backed down.

1212
01:46:55,303 --> 01:47:01,459
That is excellent.
She also mentioned President
Bush's desire for peace. Of course.

1213
01:47:03,024 --> 01:47:05,319
Peace is what we all desire.

1214
01:47:05,319 --> 01:47:12,623
But first the world has to be fair
and, at the moment, it is not fair.

1215
01:47:12,623 --> 01:47:16,066
Kuwait believes
they have powerful friends.

1216
01:47:16,066 --> 01:47:18,988
They will never agree to our demands.

1217
01:47:18,988 --> 01:47:23,057
They will continue to steal
our oil, and they will sell

1218
01:47:23,057 --> 01:47:27,752
our debt to foreign banks,
effectively making Iraq bankrupt.

1219
01:47:27,752 --> 01:47:31,196
We have no choice
but to invade, Tariq.

1220
01:47:31,196 --> 01:47:34,013
No choice.

1221
01:47:34,013 --> 01:47:35,995
Hussein?

1222
01:48:11,471 --> 01:48:15,540
I can't believe we got the Emir's
fucking dinner service.

1223
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,879
Make sure none of it gets broken.
Not to worry.

1224
01:48:18,879 --> 01:48:23,679
Ohhhh! Golden boy.

1225
01:48:26,183 --> 01:48:29,626
What? Not expecting to see me here?

1226
01:48:39,851 --> 01:48:45,277
Does my father know you're here?
Why don't you mind your own business
and I will mind mine.

1227
01:48:45,277 --> 01:48:49,346
Hey! There is enough here
for all of us. No fighting.

1228
01:48:49,346 --> 01:48:52,268
I've not forgot about you, Hussein.

1229
01:48:53,207 --> 01:48:56,337
My father has had many favourites.

1230
01:48:58,111 --> 01:49:01,033
But only one first son.

1231
01:49:14,597 --> 01:49:17,623
TV: 'The aircraft carrier
USS Independence

1232
01:49:17,623 --> 01:49:21,901
'has been sent to reinforce
American naval strength in the Gulf,

1233
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:25,239
'as the West ponders
over what to do next.

1234
01:49:25,239 --> 01:49:29,517
'The fact is that President Saddam
Hussein has seized control...'

1235
01:49:29,517 --> 01:49:36,404
Kuwait and the Americans
are buying the support
of 30 nations, Tariq.

1236
01:49:36,404 --> 01:49:40,890
It requires the might of 30 nations
to face Iraq.

1237
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:42,456
We should be proud.

1238
01:49:42,456 --> 01:49:46,003
Now, what of negotiations?

1239
01:49:46,421 --> 01:49:48,090
Not good news, Mr President.

1240
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:53,829
None of our grievances
will be considered
until we withdraw unconditionally.

1241
01:49:53,829 --> 01:49:56,646
They fear me, Tariq.

1242
01:49:56,646 --> 01:50:00,611
They want to destroy me.

1243
01:50:00,611 --> 01:50:06,245
Mr President, in the last year
the world has turned on its head.
Russia no longer has influence.

1244
01:50:06,245 --> 01:50:09,271
Russia will never abandon Iraq.

1245
01:50:10,732 --> 01:50:13,966
Gorbachev will talk,

1246
01:50:13,966 --> 01:50:16,053
and they will listen.
I'll do my very best.

1247
01:50:16,053 --> 01:50:17,723
Your Excellency!

1248
01:50:17,723 --> 01:50:19,601
Deliver Gorbachev!

1249
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:21,061
But the, er...

1250
01:50:22,209 --> 01:50:25,652
PRESIDENT BUSH ON TV:
'America will not stand aside.

1251
01:50:25,652 --> 01:50:28,052
'The world will not allow

1252
01:50:28,052 --> 01:50:31,600
'the strong to swallow up the weak.'

1253
01:50:35,252 --> 01:50:35,252
SHE SPEAKS RUSSIAN

1254
01:50:35,356 --> 01:50:38,173
'For the US repsonse we go live
to CNN's Wolf Blitzer
live at the Pentagon.'

1255
01:50:45,373 --> 01:50:45,894
'For the US repsonse we go live
to CNN's Wolf Blitzer
live at the Pentagon.'

1256
01:50:55,702 --> 01:51:01,754
'The deadline for Iraq to comply
with all UN resolutions passed
just over four hours ago

1257
01:51:01,754 --> 01:51:04,780
'with no sign of Iraqi forces
starting to pull out...'

1258
01:51:05,093 --> 01:51:06,971
Gentlemen.

1259
01:51:08,536 --> 01:51:10,727
War is now inevitable.

1260
01:51:12,188 --> 01:51:15,527
This is a war
that we have already won.

1261
01:51:15,527 --> 01:51:22,309
It takes 30 nations to stand
against one single Arab power.

1262
01:51:22,309 --> 01:51:25,752
Already we are glorious. Baba.

1263
01:51:25,752 --> 01:51:28,257
Maybe we are playing
into their hands.

1264
01:51:28,257 --> 01:51:31,074
Maybe we should pull back.

1265
01:51:31,074 --> 01:51:35,456
Even America would not
attack a retreating army.
There will be no retreat.

1266
01:51:35,456 --> 01:51:39,838
But the Americans, they have
far superior technology.

1267
01:51:39,838 --> 01:51:42,343
Smart bombs. Missiles.

1268
01:51:42,343 --> 01:51:47,142
There is a chance
we could be obliterated
before we even see their faces.

1269
01:51:47,142 --> 01:51:49,542
The President has spoken.

1270
01:51:49,542 --> 01:51:51,733
There will be no retreat.

1271
01:51:51,733 --> 01:51:53,924
Exactly.

1272
01:51:53,924 --> 01:51:55,907
Qusay,

1273
01:51:55,907 --> 01:52:02,063
America will not be able to stomach
the loss of 10,000 soldiers.

1274
01:52:02,063 --> 01:52:07,280
We have the greater will
and we will never bow our heads.

1275
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,262
Never!

1276
01:52:09,262 --> 01:52:13,958
Iraq has become the nation
we dreamed it would be

1277
01:52:13,958 --> 01:52:17,923
and God will be on our side
in this,

1278
01:52:17,923 --> 01:52:21,157
the mother of all battles.

1279
01:52:27,939 --> 01:52:30,861
AIR-RAID SIRENS WAIL

1280
01:52:38,165 --> 01:52:41,712
'Up to 20 huge explosions
shook central Baghdad.

1281
01:52:41,712 --> 01:52:45,051
'The engines of approaching
cruise missiles and allied bombers

1282
01:52:45,051 --> 01:52:47,138
'could be heard across the city.'

1283
01:52:50,268 --> 01:52:54,024
You look tired. You should rest.

1284
01:52:56,215 --> 01:52:58,824
There will be time for rest later.

1285
01:52:58,824 --> 01:53:01,641
We can stay at the next house
for at least four hours.

1286
01:53:01,641 --> 01:53:04,041
It's not far.

1287
01:53:30,648 --> 01:53:32,943
Samira... You are safe.

1288
01:53:32,943 --> 01:53:35,656
Samira.

1289
01:53:37,325 --> 01:53:39,725
She needs help.

1290
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,238
Mr President.

1291
01:54:02,889 --> 01:54:06,541
She fractured her cheekbone,
Mr President,

1292
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:10,819
and of course,
she will need stitches.

1293
01:54:10,819 --> 01:54:13,427
See to it. Of course.

1294
01:54:24,174 --> 01:54:25,739
Samira.

1295
01:54:29,391 --> 01:54:32,313
I have to go. No.

1296
01:54:32,313 --> 01:54:35,547
I will arrange for you to
be taken to safety.

1297
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:38,886
I have to go, my love.

1298
01:55:03,719 --> 01:55:05,702
Thank you.

1299
01:55:12,588 --> 01:55:16,762
We have a new command post ready
for your approval. It is close by.

1300
01:55:16,762 --> 01:55:19,057
It is a villa
of a loyal party member.

1301
01:55:19,057 --> 01:55:21,666
His name is Hafiz.

1302
01:55:26,361 --> 01:55:29,909
WOMEN WAIL, BABIES CRY

1303
01:55:45,455 --> 01:55:46,812
Baba.

1304
01:55:46,812 --> 01:55:49,733
Baba. Are you all right? Fine.

1305
01:55:49,733 --> 01:55:52,446
Everything's all ready inside.

1306
01:55:53,907 --> 01:55:57,246
HE SPEAKS FARSI

1307
01:56:25,835 --> 01:56:28,965
Mr President. I wish we had known
you were coming.

1308
01:56:28,965 --> 01:56:32,617
I would have prepared things.

1309
01:56:32,617 --> 01:56:36,686
I must get you out of the city
and into hiding.

1310
01:56:36,686 --> 01:56:40,338
As long as you're free
they cannot claim victory.

1311
01:56:41,695 --> 01:56:43,781
I will not hide.

1312
01:56:43,781 --> 01:56:46,912
In 300 years,

1313
01:56:46,912 --> 01:56:50,564
the invasion of Kuwait
will not look like a mistake.

1314
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,224
Oh.

1315
01:56:59,224 --> 01:57:02,145
My wife, Aisha.

1316
01:57:02,145 --> 01:57:05,693
Can I get you anything?
A glass of tea?

1317
01:57:05,693 --> 01:57:08,614
Tea. Thank you.

1318
01:57:09,867 --> 01:57:12,058
We must prepare.

1319
01:57:20,092 --> 01:57:24,265
Applaud your victories,
my dear citizens.

1320
01:57:24,265 --> 01:57:28,648
You have faced the might
of 30 countries,

1321
01:57:28,648 --> 01:57:31,569
great Iraqis.

1322
01:57:31,569 --> 01:57:34,386
You have won.

1323
01:57:34,386 --> 01:57:37,830
You are glorious.

1324
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:41,690
How sweet victory is.

1325
01:58:10,071 --> 01:58:14,662
I am ordering you to stand
and fight. Stand and fight!

1326
01:58:14,662 --> 01:58:17,270
Deserters will be shot.
Cowards will be shot.

1327
01:58:17,270 --> 01:58:18,731
Do you understand?

1328
01:58:21,235 --> 01:58:22,800
Hussein.

1329
01:58:24,574 --> 01:58:25,618
Hussein!

1330
01:58:29,165 --> 01:58:30,835
What's happening?

1331
01:58:32,295 --> 01:58:35,008
The withdrawal from Kuwait
is almost complete

1332
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:39,599
and we believe we have inflicted
heavy losses on our enemy.

1333
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:43,877
I'm ordering our forces
to re-group at the border.

1334
01:58:43,877 --> 01:58:48,155
The coalition would never dare
pursue us into our territory.

1335
01:58:48,155 --> 01:58:52,537
Like that, we can counterattack
more effectively.

1336
01:58:52,537 --> 01:58:54,833
Hussein!

1337
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:56,815
It's too late for lies.

1338
01:58:58,693 --> 01:59:02,450
My people report a sustained attack

1339
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:06,310
on the main column
retreating along Highway 80.

1340
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:09,023
The army is trapped
in the Mutlaa Ridge.

1341
01:59:09,023 --> 01:59:11,319
We are losing a lot of men.

1342
01:59:11,319 --> 01:59:13,614
A large number of units
are surrendering.

1343
01:59:14,762 --> 01:59:17,788
Or they are deserting.

1344
01:59:17,788 --> 01:59:22,483
Why wasn't I told this?
Have the Americans closed the border?

1345
01:59:22,483 --> 01:59:25,613
We expect them to do so
in the next couple of hours.

1346
01:59:27,596 --> 01:59:31,769
Why did you not tell me this?

1347
01:59:31,769 --> 01:59:36,360
I have not heard these reports.
You are the commander of my army!

1348
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:38,447
What good would it do?

1349
01:59:39,282 --> 01:59:42,412
We're finished.

1350
01:59:42,412 --> 01:59:45,125
There is nothing we can do
to stop them.

1351
01:59:45,125 --> 01:59:47,316
STOP IT!

1352
01:59:51,594 --> 01:59:56,185
Pull back all of the
Republican Guard units.

1353
01:59:56,185 --> 01:59:59,002
They must fall back
to defend Baldat.

1354
02:00:00,671 --> 02:00:02,237
Do it now.

1355
02:00:11,419 --> 02:00:15,488
'This is General Hussein,
your commanding officer.

1356
02:00:15,488 --> 02:00:18,931
'There are new orders
for all Republican Guard.'

1357
02:00:33,121 --> 02:00:35,521
He is sleeping.

1358
02:00:39,069 --> 02:00:40,738
To dead men.

1359
02:00:40,738 --> 02:00:43,034
Which is what we are.

1360
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:48,564
Better dead than being captured.

1361
02:00:48,564 --> 02:00:50,963
How can he sleep?

1362
02:00:54,928 --> 02:00:58,998
What were we thinking,
taking on America?

1363
02:01:00,667 --> 02:01:02,858
Can I kill him now?

1364
02:01:07,449 --> 02:01:09,432
No-one would miss him.

1365
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,927
Baba would miss him.

1366
02:01:18,927 --> 02:01:25,604
Well, if the Americans come, I'm
going to put a bullet in his head.

1367
02:01:25,604 --> 02:01:29,465
If the Americans come,
I'll be pleased to let you.

1368
02:01:33,639 --> 02:01:36,664
RADIO:

1369
02:02:03,167 --> 02:02:04,941
Baba.

1370
02:02:04,941 --> 02:02:07,132
Baba, wake up.

1371
02:02:07,132 --> 02:02:10,992
The Americans have declared
a ceasefire.

1372
02:02:10,992 --> 02:02:12,975
They are withdrawing to the border.

1373
02:02:20,487 --> 02:02:22,574
Are you sure?

1374
02:02:24,244 --> 02:02:26,330
It's confirmed.

1375
02:02:29,774 --> 02:02:34,469
This comes direct from God.

1376
02:02:34,469 --> 02:02:37,599
God has chosen life
for Saddam Hussein.

1377
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:40,521
I need to see my people.

1378
02:02:40,521 --> 02:02:42,921
I must declare our victory!

1379
02:02:45,216 --> 02:02:48,033
This is a great victory!

1380
02:02:48,033 --> 02:02:50,120
A great victory, my sons!

1381
02:02:56,902 --> 02:03:01,702
Praise be to Allah for saving Iraq.

1382
02:03:01,702 --> 02:03:06,606
Praise be to Allah
for saving Saddam Hussein.

1383
02:03:17,457 --> 02:03:19,857
This is MY country.

1384
02:03:23,509 --> 02:03:26,535
This is my country!

1385
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:31,960
My country!
