00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:11,179
Low somber classical music.

Low somber classical music. 
(Bach's II-Adagio)

3
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,533
HAMILTON:
You know I once knew a guy

4
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:17,171
who thought that every
time he would kill someone it

5
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:21,875
would keep death too busy
to catch up with him...

6
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,480
You have something I need,

7
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:29,417
You were paid to do a job...

8
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,652
You shouldn't have told
SERGI about the case,

9
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,521
you were not
instructed to do so...

10
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,589
THE WAITER: 
I was hired by SERGI,

11
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,758
and I do what I want.

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,493
I got a name and
I did the job.

13
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,230
HAMILTON: 
Perhaps I should have been 
more clear.

14
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:46,467
SERGI will ask where the 
case went, you tell him

15
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,173
you opened it, it was empty,
so you dumped it.

16
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:59,146
Here's a little extra...
for the miscommunication.

17
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,351
Next time any
liberties will cost you.

18
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:06,787
THE WAITER: 
Theres not going to be 
a next time...

19
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,357
And I don't want
your little extra.

20
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,427
HAMILTON: 
Just take the money,
you have absolutely no idea

21
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:17,465
what kind of waters your
thinking about swimming in...

22
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:22,236
The sharks that swim in these
waters are much bigger than you.

23
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,941
I know what your thinking,
your feeling cock strong...

24
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,879
Your going to bite the
hand that feeds you...

25
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,448
But these
people are not on your level,

26
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,484
these are the big boys now...

27
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,787
They don't walk into places
guns blazing like the old west

28
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,589
...No...

29
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,857
...that's you...

30
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,461
They just think about
it, and you're gone...

31
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:52,400
And anyone who
remembers you is gone...

32
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,336
Then you're not
even a memory...

33
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,305
They don't pull triggers...

34
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:01,542
They just think about
it, and you're gone.

35
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,577
So take the money...

36
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,945
THE WAITER: 
And if I don't?

37
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,348
HAMILTON:
Just take
the fucking money!

38
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:14,288
Don't be a wank!
This is just a thank you...

39
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:18,726
Hind sight it was probably
better it was in your hands.

40
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,862
Actually you did us a favor...

41
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,499
So, here's what you'll do.

42
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:31,472
When the car stops get
out, leave the case.

43
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,507
THE WAITER: 
And my other option is?

44
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,543
HAMILTON: 
There is no other option.

45
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:46,987
THUG: 
Fuck you asshole!

46
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:56,764
THE WAITER: 
Hello...
Just tell me where...

47
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,765

48
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,999

49
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,035
THE WAITER (CONT'D):

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,573

00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,778
THE WAITER:

53
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,980
COURIER:

54
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,915
I could go ahead and
have you sign for this?

55
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,951
THE WAITER: 
How could I sign if you don't
have a name. (door slams)

56
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:22,716
(ethereal, serene music)

57
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,688
(ethereal, serene music)

58
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,993
THE WAITER: 
You know they say
you shouldn't stay in the sun

59
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,363
for longer than 45 minutes...

60
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,098
TIFFANY: 
Really...

61
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,367
when "They" were giving you
that life saving piece of

62
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,802
advice...

63
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,705
did "They" tell you that
smoking causes lung cancer?

64
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,939
THE WAITER: 
No...

65
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,841
Must have
missed that class...

66
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,377
TIFFANY: 
Do you always
spy on girls sunbathing...

67
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,011
THE WAITER: 
I was just...

68
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:51,712
TIFFANY:

69
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,713
don't tell me...

70
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,382
You came down here
to check your mail...

71
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,718
Yeah right you've lived in
that apartment for two months

72
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,653
and you've never
checked your mail...

73
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,655
THE WAITER: 
It's good to know
that my neighbors are spying

74
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,990

75
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,391

Bobby...
That's your name...

80
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,598

00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,599
THE WAITER:

82
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,399
TIFFANY: 
Really?

83
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,834

00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,669
WAITER:
No, never.

85
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,638

Well that's what you are.

86
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,906

87
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,108
TIFFANY: 
What exactly do you do Bobby?

88
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,075
No, wait...

00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,644

TIFFANY: 
Cuz I might
be disappointed and...

92
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,980
THE WAITER: 
How could
you be disappointed,

93
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,582
you don't even know me...

94
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,918
TIFFANY: 
You know you could
be something lame like a

95
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,822
web designer...
Or worse a lawyer...

96
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,024
THE WAITER: 
Do I look
like a lawyer?

97
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,093
Don't worry I'm not...
Not a web designer either...

98
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,529
TIFFANY: 
Don't tell me
who you work for either...

99
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,930
THE WAITER: 
I don't have an employer.

100
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,131
TIFFANY: 
You know what...

101
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,534
Any other time I would think
the guy was a total loser...

102
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,802
But for some reason
this is kinda hot!

00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,604

118
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,472

00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:20,080
I love you...
I'll see you tomorrow.

174
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,114
FORD B: 
Typical...

175
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,885
Bad dream...

176
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:29,022
THE WAITER: 
You forgot your drink.

177
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:29,923
FORD B:
Oh...

178
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,124
Usually don't
drink this late,

179
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:36,129
but figurin' I won't have to
worry about these anymore...

180
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,197
So ah...

181
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,331
what is it you do
for the company?

182
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,134
THE WAITER:
Listen...I don't mean to be
rude...

183
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:46,706
But I don't want to talk
to you....

184
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:56,216
I asked you to
drink...

185
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,752
THE WAITER (CONT'D): 
I'm gonna need several things
from you tonight...

186
00:11:58,786 --> 00:11:59,419
FORD B:
Sure...

187
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:04,191
Anything...

188
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:18,772
THE WAITER:
First I need
you to finish that drink....

189
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:21,341
THE WAITER (CONT'D):
Do you own a gun?

190
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,710
FORD B: 
Ahh...

191
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,378
I ahh...

192
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,980
THE WAITER: 
Sir, I asked you...

193
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,748
Do you own a gun?

194
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,886
It's a simple question.

195
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,487
FORD: 
Yeah...

196
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,056
THE WAITER:
Where's it kept?

197
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:36,623
FORD: 
Ah..

198
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,757
I keep one upstairs...

199
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:42,495
And there's one under the
seat of my wife's car....

200
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,096
Look...

201
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,865
Umm..

202
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:45,732
It's gettin' late.

203
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,935
Maybe, you know...

204
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,203
You got what you want.

205
00:12:50,237 --> 00:13:00,280
THE WAITER: 
I asked you
to finish that drink.

206
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:10,290
THE WAITER: 
I asked you
to finish that drink.

207
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,214
I'm gonna need you to give me a
ride.

208
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:44,291
FORD B.
Okay...

209
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:54,301
FORD B.
Okay...

210
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,615
(gunshot echoes in the night)

211
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:39,947
HECTOR: 
Saw you talking to
my girl the other day...

212
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,848
THE WAITER: 
She didn't seem to 
mind much.

213
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,451
HECTOR: 
You know I'm a bouncer
down at the OMNI CLUB right.

214
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,991
Get ta kick yuppie
prick's asses...

215
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,293
every night...

216
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,094
For a living...

217
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,862
That's what I do...

218
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,530
THE WAITER: 
And I'm not a yuppie.

219
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,200
HECTOR: 
Whatever man...

220
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:04,637
I don't want you
talking to my girl...

221
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,374
Now I'm not trying to
be a dick about this,

222
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,044
for certain annoying
muthafuckers like yourself.

223
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,513
I can get real...

224
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,149
real hard.

225
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,585
Fuck you up, make
you my little bitch.

226
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,020
THE WAITER: 
How long have you
been out here

227
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,156
rehearsing that line waiting for
me...

228
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,125
HECTOR: 
I ain't been
out here long cuz...

229
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,926
I know what
time you get home.

230
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,328
I know your schedule.

231
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,064
THE WAITER: 
You don't know anything.

232
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,265
HECTOR: 
Oh I know a lot...

233
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,367
You don't know shit!

234
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,236
THE WAITER: 
Really.

235
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,438
I know that your
fucking the whore in 207...

236
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:41,074
I know you sell a little
ecstacy on the side...

237
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:45,045
I even know what dryer sheets
you use when you do laundry.

238
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48,348
And I know if you
come at me again...

239
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,917
I'm going to hurt you.

240
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,186
I am gonna hurt
you really bad.

241
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,222
HECTOR: 
Fuck you man...

242
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:06,293
SHARI: 
Love...

243
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:12,132
Mercy...

244
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:17,437
Pity...

245
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,273
Peace...

246
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:23,476
SHARI (CONT'D) 
And all must love the human
form,

247
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,479
in heathen, turk or jew.

248
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,015
SHARI (CONT'D) 
Where Mercy, Love and Pity
dwell,

249
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
there God is dwelling too.

250
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,386
SHARI (CONT'D) 
Go...

251
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,021
Leave this place.

252
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:45,098
(gasps)

253
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:55,108
(gasps)

254
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,084
(offscreen: moaning)

255
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:48,127
TIFFANY Moans intensely.

256
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:01,501
PRIEST: 
Sorry, didn't
mean to startle you.

257
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,403
THE WAITER: 
It's okay...

258
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:06,906
PRIEST: 
Mind if I sit.

259
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,343
PRIEST (CONT'D): 
I do apologize for startling
you.

260
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,880
But we have a very old
congregation here and,

261
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,583
whenever I see a new young
face I get a bit over zealous

262
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,452
in welcoming them.

263
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,521
THE WAITER: 
It's really okay...

264
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,823
PRIEST: 
Okay then
I am relieved,

265
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,860
now how are you?

266
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,796
THE WAITER: 
I guess I'm fine.

267
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,800
PRIEST: 
You sure about that.

268
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,870
Son this is the
Lord's sanctuary,

269
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:46,613
no man can judge you
or harm you here...

270
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,715
THE WAITER: 
I know...

271
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,517
PRIEST: 
Then you must have
thought it was the Holy Ghost

272
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:56,889
standing behind you, the
way you were startled.

273
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,759
THE WAITER: 
Somebody I
knew just passed away...

274
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:04,331
PRIEST: 
Ah, sorry to hear that,

275
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:09,502
loss is hard to deal with, it
forces one to face their own

276
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,837
earthly mortality...

277
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:17,610
And their
spiritual immortality...

278
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:23,350
THE WAITER: 
I don't know which
one is harder to face...

279
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:33,426
PRIEST: 
Thus is the
crux of faith...

280
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:43,436
PRIEST: 
Thus is the
crux of faith...

281
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,710
DESK ATTENDENT:
Welcome to hotel Granduca.

282
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:58,678
THE WAITER: 
Frank Maro?

283
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,780
DESK ATTENDENT: 
He's in the billard room.

284
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:15,061
(crack of the billiard balls)

285
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:18,030
HANDLER: 
You look like a
ghost...

286
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,066
THE WAITER: 
I've been worse.

287
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,469
HANDLER: 
How you
like my hotel?

288
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:24,103
HOTEL GM: 
Sir, you have a message.

289
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:24,937
HANDLER: 
Thank you.

290
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,575
THE WAITER: It's
a nice place...

291
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:30,042
THE WAITER (CONT'D): 
So you got news for me?

292
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,511
HANDLER: 
You know the news...

293
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,780
You do good
work, clean work...

294
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,448
THE WAITER: 
So what's the situation?

295
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,584
HANDLER: 
It's not your
fault about the girl,

296
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,786
it's bad intelligence...

297
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,753
THE WAITER: 
How so?

298
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,822
HANDLER: 
It's gotten complicated.

299
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,023
HANDLER (CONT'D): 
Your in the middle of
something...

300
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:47,594
And it's deep
and it's dirty...

301
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:48,861
THE WAITER: 
How dirty are we talking?

302
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,797
HANDLER: 
Filthy...

303
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,532
Nasty...

304
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,100
HANDLER (CONT'D): 
One's screwing the 
other one and

305
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,402
they're both
screwing a lot of people,

306
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,004
and your gonna wind
up in the middle.

307
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,305
THE WAITER: 
So what's your advice?

308
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,675
HANDLER: 
Just give the package
to the client and clean up.

309
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:04,644
It will save you some running,

310
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,979
and I'll make sure that
they compensate you....

311
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,415
THE WAITER:
I'm not gonna do that...

312
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,018
Yet I trust you with my life,
and you just keep putting me

313
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,419
out there like that?

314
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,721
HANDLER: 
And I would
never ask you to...

315
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:18,491
But it isn't me asking.
It's just what's got to be done.

316
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:19,826
THE WAITER: 
The girls not an issue.

317
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:24,731
HANDLER: 
Maybe not to you,
but to others she's an issue.

318
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,032
She makes you...

319
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,900
Everybody takes a fall.

320
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:30,670
THE WAITER: 
This is sloppy.

321
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,939
The courier, that
was their mistake...

322
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,741
And it's your mistake
for letting them make that

323
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:35,975
mistake.

324
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:40,112
HANDLER: 
True, but now it's
your problem and you gotta

325
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,681
deal with it.

326
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:45,652
Kid this is so deep...

327
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,954
Too deep for you...

328
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:58,030
Now get the hell out of here.

329
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:08,808
Now get the hell out of here.

330
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,578
HAMILTON: 
Have a drink with
me to help celebrate our new

331
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:19,752
working relationship.

332
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,520
HAMILTON: 
I could always use someone 
with your

333
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,255
skills...

334
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:28,861
THE WAITER: 
Sorry, I get
restless in cubical jobs.

335
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,529
HAMILTON: 
So what do I call you?

336
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,531
THE WAITER: 
Call me whatever you like...

337
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,133
HAMILTON: 
No names, right...

338
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:38,504
So you don't even have a
nickname you give people?

339
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,141
THE WAITER: 
No, too cliche...

340
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:45,277
Kind of like this
limo, and your goons.

341
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,914
HAMILTON 
Right, right, right...

342
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,216
So are you going to deal

343
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,550
assignment soon...

344
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,653
My people are
getting anxious.

345
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,021
THE WAITER: 
It'll be done.

346
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,224
HAMILTON: 
By tonight
8'oclock sharp...

347
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:01,227
Your man will be contacted.

348
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,730
He'll be told
where you need to be.

349
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:04,864
THE WAITER: 
Okay.

350
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,298
Is that all?

351
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,635
Or are you following me
just to ask me my name.

352
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,804
HAMILTON: 
No, I need the briefcase you
were given.

353
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:12,571
THE WAITER: 
No.

354
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,940
HAMILTON: 
What do you mean no...

355
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,574
I hired you...

356
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,943
THE WAITER: 
No, my client hired me,

357
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,978
my client will pay for it.

358
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,749
You provided a mark.

359
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,250
If you have a problem with
not receiving the package

360
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:28,587
take it up with
the Russians...

361
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,957
They are your
partners alright.

362
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,625
HAMILTON: 
You have to understand 
the chain of

363
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:37,664
command, if I don't do what
the people above me want,

364
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:41,801
I get shit on,
if I get shit on,

365
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,804
you get shit on...

366
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:46,873
THE WAITER: 
I think we're done,

367
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:47,907
stop the car.

368
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,142
HAMILTON: 
We're not done 
until I say so.

369
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,277
THE WAITER: 
Stop the car.

370
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,112
LIMO THUG: 
We'll tell you
when it's time to stop.

371
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,114
(Glass shatters, man screams
in pain)

372
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,215
THE WAITER: 
We...ARE...

373
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,985
DONE.

374
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:04,023
HAMILTON: 
Tom, stop the car.

375
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:34,721
TIFFANY: 
Hey Bobby! You look nice...

376
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,222
HECTOR: 
What the fuck was 
that shit...

377
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,791
TIFFANY:

378
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:42,061
HECTOR:

379
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,329
TIFFANY 
Fuck you!

380
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:43,896
HECTOR: 
Once a dumb bitch...

381
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,932
Always a dumb bitch...

382
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,034
I knew wanna ta fuck him...
You stupid whore...

383
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:52,204
TIFFANY: 
It's not like you don't fuck who
ever you want

384
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,139
with your little dick!

385
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,273
(three knocks at the door)

386
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:58,410
HECTOR: 
This is perfect...
I hope it's him...

387
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:04,383
Now you're gonna get to watch
me fuck-up your new boyfriend!

388
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,352
It's him...

389
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:13,359
What! Isn't this perfect!
Wassup?! Come on white boy...

390
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:16,695
Be a hero...
Come on...

391
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,797
HECTOR (CONT'D): 
Ahh...!

392
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,232
TIFFANY: 
How do you like it 
you stupid fuck!

393
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,233
THE WAITER: 
Should I stop?

394
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,836
TIFFANY: 
Fuck him...

395
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,174
THUMP!

396
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,242
TIFFANY: 
What did you do with him?

397
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:32,244
THE WAITER: 
He's in the alley...

398
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,312
TIFFANY: 
Is he OK

399
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,680
THE WAITER: 
What is this, is he
okay?

400
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,215
Five minutes ago you were
telling me to fuck him up?

401
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,683
Now you care?

402
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,251
TIFFANY: 
I was angry...

403
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:42,021
THE WAITER: 
Oh you were angry...

404
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,023
Okay, next time
I'll remember that.

405
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,257
I'll just let him
beat the hell outta you.

406
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,026
TIFFANY: He has friends.

407
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,027
He'll come after you...

408
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,028
THE WAITER: 
Are his friends cops...?

409
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,029
TIFFANY: 
No.

410
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,030
THE WAITER: 
Would he call the cops.

411
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,032
TIFFANY:
 No... No way...

412
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,034
THE WAITER: 
Then I think I'll be fine...

413
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,036
TIFFANY: 
Why are you being like this.

414
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:57,970
THE WAITER: 
I am being like me.

415
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,839
It's who I am...

416
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,874
I don't think you
know who the fuck I am.

417
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,876
and I sure as hell
don't know who you are.

418
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,312
Some guy's beating the hell
out of you and I stop him and

419
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:09,415
all you care about's him?
How's he doin?

420
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,382
You know what,
he's in the dumpster,

421
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,852
go find him.
Have a happy life together.

422
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,186
TIFFANY:
It's not that simple...

423
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,156
We've been
together for like 8 months...

424
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,825
and yeah he is a fucker...

425
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:22,028
But you can't stop caring
about somebody in a
couple seconds...

426
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:23,295
THE WAITER: 
I can.

427
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,496
TIFFANY: 
Oh you can...

428
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,498
THE WAITER: 
Yeah...

429
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,301
I just did.

430
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,403
TIFFANY: 
You don't mean that.

431
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:39,145
THE WAITER: 
I got somewhere to be.

432
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:42,481
(seagulls cawing)
(waves breaking)

433
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,894
(shouting in russian)

434
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:50,883
HAMILTON: 
Ivan, you look like
you've lost weight.

435
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:53,119
Why, you're
almost petite.

436
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:55,154
IVAN: 
Shut the fuck up.

437
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,257
HAMILTON: 
Ahh, and such a
delightful personality.

438
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,060
SERGI: 
 We are hearing
very upsetting things,

439
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:04,897
we like to know, where
the fuck our money is?

440
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,599
HAMILTON: 
I have been assured that all the
documents are

441
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,601
secure and will
be delivered soon.

442
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,503
We will take care of
all the loose ends.

443
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:14,140
IVAN:
Nothing is to happen to KINSKY.

444
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,475
HAMILTON: 
How are we suppose to make this
go away with

445
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,511
potential problems walking
around.

446
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:24,050
SERGI: 
Mr. HAMILTON, have you lost your
faith in us?

447
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,285
HAMILTON:
I just don't think it's wise,

448
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,955
what if he gets
picked up and talks?

449
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:31,357
IVAN: 
He won't be, and if he is...

450
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,525
we will deal with it.

451
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,328
What happened to your face?

452
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:37,463
THUG: 
Fuck You!

453
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,932
Tell your
mother I said hello.

454
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,304
HAMILTON: 
The guy you hired for me
is a bit of a nut case,

455
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,939
he needs to be dealt with...

456
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:50,576
IVAN: 
Oh, is that what
happened to your face.

457
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:55,447
(laughs)

458
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,921
(lip smack)

459
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:11,063
(ethereal choral music)

460
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:49,301
PRIEST: 
Glad to see you
found your way back....

461
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:53,139
THE WAITER:
I needed somebody to talk to...

462
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:56,342
It's been a long time
since I've confessed...

463
00:32:56,375 --> 00:33:00,946
PRIEST: 
Well you've
come to the right place.

464
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,448
THE WAITER: You ever had a
friend that you haven't

465
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,484
talked to in a long time and
just don't know how to talk

466
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:06,618
them anymore?

467
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:10,189
PRIEST: 
Yes. A friend...

468
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,591
But never to my Father.

469
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,661
Why don't you start with
'hello.'

470
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:19,298
I think it'll get easier.

471
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:23,202
We all have something
to talk about with Him,

472
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,338
you're already here so you
must want to talk about it...

473
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,640
So just start
talking.

474
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:38,717
He's here...
He'll listen...

475
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:48,727
He's here...
He'll listen...

476
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:35,541
(loud rock and roll music)

477
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:01,300
HANDLER: 
Hey kid...

478
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,169
Relax...sit.

479
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:10,342
(cont.) That's Summer...
She's a very bright girl.

480
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:11,677
THE WAITER: 
Is this going to take long...

481
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,279
COCKTAILER: 
Can I get you something...?

482
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,513
THE WAITER: 
Gin and tonic...

483
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:18,250
HANDLER: 
You know...
a man with a clean conscience...

484
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:20,852
is a man with an
empty bottle of gin...

485
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,121
THE WAITER: 
Then I'll have a whisky and
cola.

486
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,390
So should I order you one?

487
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,425
HANDLER: 
Make mine a Scotch...

488
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,596
Have you ever noticed that
strippers have small bladders?

489
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,331
Always going to
the restroom...

490
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,434
THE WAITER: 
No, I tend not to spend much
time or money on them.

491
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,769
HANDLER: 
You should start investing in
their future.

492
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,372
THE WAITER: 
Really what's your current rate
of return on a stripper?

493
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:43,209
HANDLER: 
I'm just saying, you got time,

494
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:45,811
it's a hobby, man's
gotta have a hobby.

495
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:46,878
THE WAITER: 
I'll think about it...

496
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,448
HANDLER: 
I don't come here for girls,

497
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,717
I come here for
the environment...

498
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,321
this place is one
big social kaleidoscope...

499
00:35:55,354 --> 00:36:00,792
It's amazing, sociologically...
It's a microcosm of our world...

500
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,628
Ya got the have's the have
not's...

501
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,798
The desperate, the fortunate...
Who is using who...

502
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,201
Who's fucking who?

503
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,336
KINSKY: 
Sit down sweetheart....

504
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:13,205
STRIPPER: 
I thought you'd never ask.

505
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,606
KINSKY: 
My name's Kinsky...

506
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,409
Kinda rhymes with
kinky doesn't it...

507
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:18,710
It's funny how
it does that...

508
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,545
STRIPPER: 
I...I like that.
I like that...

509
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:20,846
KINSKY: 
So what do they call you?

510
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,813
STRIPPER: 
They call me Cinnamon.

511
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,349
KINSKY: 
Cinnamon?

512
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,284
I can see why.
What's your real name?

513
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,319
CINNAMON: 
Don't you want to know what
Cinnamon tastes like?

514
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,154
HANDLER: 
Take him for example...

515
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,424
He's got money,
she's got youth...

516
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:35,494
And she has a boyfriend and
you can tell she doesn't like

517
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,796
him pawing her.
So...

518
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,432
Who's using who?

519
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:41,533
THE WAITER: 
They're both using each other...

520
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,303
HANDLER: 
Wrong...

521
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,506
THE WAITER:
He's using her, cash he's giving
up he doesn't care about.

522
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,243
He has got plenty of it... She
doesn't have a lot of respect.

523
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,645
HANDLER: 
I didn't look at it like that...

524
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,748
Very poetic...
But your still wrong...

525
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:59,851
You're wrong because I
am using both of them.

526
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,722
She was paid to keep him
content 'til you got here...

527
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:09,194
See, I've made designs on that
man's life...

528
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,763
You ever look at a guy
like that and think...

529
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:17,936
He has no idea...
Soon he will cease to be.

530
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,238
THE WAITER: 
We'll all cease to be.
What does it matter?

531
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:24,676
HANDLER:
Ah, but you know when that
moment will come.

532
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,978
He has no idea of those
designs...

533
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,914
Now the question is...

534
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:32,818
Does someone have
designs on your life...?

535
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,686
THE WAITER:
You trying to tell me somethin'?

536
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,890
HANDLER: 
You become a pawn, a patsy,
you're disposable.

537
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:43,329
That man over there is the
key to find out whose making

538
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,630
those plans.

539
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:49,768
Now I'm telling you when another
man makes designs on your life,

540
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,938
You kill that man...

541
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,349
Now don't get to distracted
that you forget to work.

542
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,886
* I use to work in Chicago,

543
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,755
* in a department store....

544
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,535
SUMMER: 
He paid me a lot of
money to take care of you...

545
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,637
And I'll do whatever you
want to make you stay.

546
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:26,705
THE WAITER: 
Anything?

547
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:27,773
SUMMER: 
Anything...

548
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,608
THE WAITER: 
Can you leave?

549
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,612
KINSKY: 
Don't leave...

550
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,882
And order me another round okay?

551
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,503
KINSKY: 
See something you like?

552
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,507
Sure you're in the
right strip club?

553
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,924
KINSKY: 
'Scuse me.
Where's the fucking black bitch?

554
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,426
WAITRESS: 
What are you talking about?

555
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,326
KINSKY: 
Cinnamon.

556
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,994
She took fucking
forty dollars of mine.

557
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,630
Goes off to get
a fucking drink.

558
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,064
I come back here
and I find you...

559
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:26,965
WAITRESS: Calm Down
THE WAITER: Kinsky!

560
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:27,666
KINSKY: 
What?

561
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,934
(Punch)

562
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,769
THE WAITER: 
Sit Down.

563
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,370
WAITRESS:
Okay, okay, okay...

564
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,372
THE WAITER: 
You're not a part of this.

565
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,809
Get up!

566
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:53,492
KINSKY: 
This is not fucking good!

567
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,461
THE WAITER: 
Give me your fucking keys.

568
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,863
I'm driving...
Give your fucking keys.

569
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,065
KINSKY: 
Where are we going?

570
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:00,966
THE WAITER: 
To the Russians...

571
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,100
KINSKY: 
Oh Holy Fuck!

572
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,035
You don't know what your
getting yourself into...

573
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,505
Your gonna fuck both of us...

574
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:08,974
How much do you want?
I can pay you.

575
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,409
THE WAITER: 
You don't have enough money.

576
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:15,080
Get in the fucking car...
NOW!

577
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:20,819
KINSKY:
They're gonna kill me...
I don't want to die...

578
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:23,789
Why the fuck are you doing this?
Is it money?!

579
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:26,024
THE WAITER: 
Calm the fuck down...

580
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,728
Tell me the situation...
Who's involved?

581
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:35,601
KINSKY: 
Listen... You don't even want to
know... I can't tell you.

582
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,537
THE WAITER: 
Then tell me a story.
Make it a bed time story...

583
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,808
Something that never happened,
but you better keep my interest.

584
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,678
KINSKY: 
Alright...

585
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:50,081
I'll tell you a hypothetical
story...

586
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,751
Just hypothetical, that's all...
It's a umm...

587
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,620
It's a hypothetical situation!

588
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:55,587
THE WAITER: 
Tell the story.

589
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,122
KINSKY: 
It's hypothetical... Okay?

590
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:58,189
THE WAITER: 
Tell the story.

591
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,057
KINSKY: 
Okay, but it's just
hypothetical...

592
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,893
THE WAITER: 
Tell the fucking story!!

593
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,764
KINSKY: 
Story begins...

594
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,566
Once upon a fucking time
and all that bullshit,

595
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,468
because it's
purely hypothetical.

596
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,838
There are four groups and
each is getting something

597
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,840
from the other...

598
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:17,543
You've got a government
leader with an agenda,

599
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:19,945
a corrupt inter-national
energy company,

600
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,014
world wide
terrorist organization,

601
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:26,017
and you got a hand full of
ex-KGB agents turned

602
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,620
euntrepreneurs.

603
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,489
Each of these groups
wants something and the other

604
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,059
groups can afford
them what they want.

605
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:36,828
First you got your
government leader...

606
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:40,098
And he's a fucking cowboy
and he wants to launch a 21

607
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,768
century fucking crusade.

608
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,069
The energy company.

609
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,672
They've already profited
from putting this leader into

610
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,641
power in the first place,
and now they realize they're

611
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,911
gonna profit wildly from
instability in the region

612
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:56,014
where this
crusade is to occur.

613
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:58,884
Now your ex-KGB contingent...

614
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,621
They've already sealed a deal
to fund an international drug

615
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:05,957
smuggling operation utilizing
the shipping resources of the

616
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,826
very same company.

617
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,227
I hope your taking
notes 'cause I'm gonna ask

618
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,097
questions later.

619
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,265
The bosses at the company...

620
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,868
They realize that there's
a good profit to be made.

621
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:19,938
So they're willing to just
give up their morals for a

622
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,272
little while.

623
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:24,009
And they think that
everything's going to go great.

624
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:30,816
But... Something bad happens.
and a loss here and a loss

625
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,085
there and pretty soon they're
losing millions... Billions...

626
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:39,224
And nobody can account for a
fucking dime.

627
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:43,829
So they sell their soul for
the all mighty dollar and

628
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:47,198
they broker a deal that's
gonna make everybody happy.

629
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,568
They persuade the Ruskies
to aid the terror cell,

630
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:52,604
just a little bit to do
something to give probable

631
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,906
cause to the crusade.

632
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,843
Ya follow me...

633
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:01,179
Now everybody's happy, the
towel heads think they've

634
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:05,717
earned their 76 virgins, the
company's got it's unstable

635
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:09,187
region, and the government
leader, well...

636
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,791
Yippe- eye-yay-kye-yay he
thinks that he's gonna have

637
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:17,595
himself a righteous fucking
crusade. Ruskies...

638
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:23,869
All they care about is money.
But again...something happens,

639
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:28,807
something goes wrong,
shareholders start to hear

640
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,276
rumors that the
company is bleeding money.

641
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:32,811
And they jump ship.

642
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,680
And then
everybody's jumping ship.

643
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:40,285
And the ship's going
down and eventually...

644
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,055
They're gonna find out where
all the bodies are buried...

645
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:50,095
And they'll know who
caused the ship to sink.

646
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:54,099
You seem to be a
reasonable man...

647
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,100
What do you want?

648
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,101
Is it girls?

649
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,636
I can get 'em for you.

650
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,639
Boys? Hey...
More power to ya.

651
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:09,347
Please...
You can't take me to them...

652
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,683
I'll pay you whatever it takes.

653
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,384
THE WAITER: 
Looks like you went swimming
with the sharks,

654
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:15,653
and now you're complaining
'cause you got bit.

655
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,355
KINSKY: 
Fuck you...

656
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,857
(gunshot in the distance)

657
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:22,393
(music swells)

658
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:26,431
(intense upbeat chase music)

659
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,086
(BANG!) 
(gunshot echoes in
garage)

660
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,696
THE WAITER: 
I hope you don't have somebody
waitin' on you...

661
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,032
'Cause you're not
lookin' so hot, buddy.

662
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:06,137
THE WAITER: 
Now, I just wanted to talk to
you.

663
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:37,368
So who hired you?

664
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:43,508
Listen man...

665
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:46,878
no hard feelings you would
have done the same thing.

666
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:53,751
You and me are
in the same boat.

667
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,190
You serve?

668
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,933
Gulf?

669
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,437
You're not a real
big talker are you?

670
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,972
That's cool.

671
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:38,329
Want a cigarette?

672
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:41,166
(coughing)

673
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:50,408
They're not good for you...

674
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,043
Don't want it?

675
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,550
THE SHOOTER: 
I... don't... smoke...

676
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:01,819
(coughing)

677
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:07,325
THE WAITER: 
Yeah, it'll kill ya.

678
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:35,620
(ambient music)

679
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,102
(radio playing) ANNOUNCER: 
A small upscale community of
Sugar Land.

680
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:53,571
Police have found the
body of Ford Bynum.

681
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,874
Dead from an apparent
self-inflicted gunshot wound.

682
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,843
Bynum leaves behind- 
(radio dial clicks off)

683
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,078
(phone rings) THE WAITER:
Yeah...

684
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:02,047
Do they think it was me?

685
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,584
No, it's a Latin guy... Mid
30's... Had some tats...

686
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,887
Definitely ex military.

687
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:10,721
What time?

688
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:14,059
So I take it, Kinsky's my
problem?

689
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:16,061
I'll take care of it.

690
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:03,468
TIFFANY: 
You moving out?

691
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:05,236
THE WAITER: 
I'm goin' on a trip...

692
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,737
TIFFANY: 
A permanent trip?

693
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,373
THE WAITER: 
What's up with all the
questions...

694
00:50:08,406 --> 00:50:10,075
Why don't you go
find your boyfriend...

695
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,176
TIFFANY:
Are you hurt?

696
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:12,577
THE WAITER: 
No, I'm fine.

697
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:19,617
TIFFANY: 
Look, I'm stupid... Fuck
Hector... I'm sorry...

698
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,186
THE WAITER: 
Okay...

699
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,487
TIFFANY: 
Are you in trouble?

700
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,055
THE WAITER: 
You could say that.

701
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:25,490
TIFFANY: 
Where are you going?

702
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,992
THE WAITER:
Somewhere...I don't know...
away from here...

703
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,561
TIFFANY: 
Can I take care of your head
before you bleed to death?

704
00:50:34,132 --> 00:50:36,567
TIFFANY: 
Sit.

705
00:50:57,322 --> 00:51:02,627
So, should I even try to figure
out what happened to you?

706
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,095
THE WAITER: 
I fell.

707
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:07,332
TIFFANY: 
You fell... Okay...

708
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,666
There you go.

709
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:09,767
THE WAITER:
Thanks.

710
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,769
TIFFANY: 
You're welcome.

711
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:17,442
I owe you anyway for stopping
Hector... so thank you.

712
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:22,847
THE WAITER: 
You don't owe me anything,
he was askin' for it.

713
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:28,386
TIFFANY: 
That really must have been some
fall, got your neck too.

714
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:36,661
Stay here tonight...

715
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,597
THE WAITER: 
I have to be somewhere.

716
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,200
TIFFANY: 
Then stay here for now...

717
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:47,838
THE WAITER: 
Why are you doing this?

718
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:50,208
TIFFANY: 
Cuz I want to...

719
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,311
THE WAITER: 
Listen, You don't owe me
anything.

720
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:54,345
TIFFANY: 
Look this isn't...

721
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:57,148
THE WAITER: 
I'm not the relationship type...

722
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:00,285
TIFFANY: 
This isn't about me owing you
anything.

723
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,787
and I don't want to fuck
you into a relationship...

724
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,755
I just want to fuck you...

725
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,159
Is that so bad?

726
00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:12,330
I mean night after
night you hear me,

727
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,632
aren't you the
least bit curious...?

728
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,703
THE WAITER: 
No.

729
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:25,543
(love making
music)

730
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:06,851
TIFFANY: 
Wow...

731
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:10,855
I just had sex with a guy and I
don't even know his first name.

732
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:15,826
THE WAITER: 
My name's Bobby, remember you
gave it to me.

733
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,565
TIFFANY: 
Yeah but, I don't even know what
you do...

734
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:23,534
THE WAITER: 
Do you really need to know?

735
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:27,272
TIFFANY: 
It would be nice...

736
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:31,542
THE WAITER: 
I think it's better this way,
there's less ties between us.

737
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,244
TIFFANY: 
Okay, um...

738
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:36,947
now I feel like a complete
whore.

739
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,749
THE WAITER: 
Well I hope you're not...

740
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:41,386
because I don't have any money.

741
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:48,926
TIFFANY: 
Asshole.
Tell me something...

742
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,363
Make me feel less like a slut...

743
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,865
Tell me a secret.

744
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,936
THE WAITER: 
I really hate it when people ask
me what my

745
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,239
name is and what I do.

746
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:09,614
So many people are
defined by those questions...

747
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:13,451
It's like it's the medieval
times.

748
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:18,423
With Dick the cobbler and
Jane the fucking whore.

749
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:24,395
THE WAITER (V.O.) 
It's nothing less than the
quantification of humanity.

750
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:26,497
And we do it to ourselves.

751
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:30,768
You know I hate working for
people, basically they're just

752
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:34,772
asking you to do what's beneath
them.

753
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,707
Sometimes I look in the
mirror after I shave and

754
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:39,410
don't recognize myself.

755
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,979
It's like when you put on a new
suit...

756
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,516
Well not necessarily
new, like new to you...

757
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,752
You become a new person.

758
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,356
Have you ever watched another
person sleep, when you

759
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:57,328
really watch 'em, day after
day...

760
00:54:57,362 --> 00:55:01,366
Their eyes twitch...
you study their breathing...

761
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:03,834
I don't think there's anything
more intimate.

762
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:05,870
It becomes a part of you.

763
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,042
I always like to watch my
lover sleep...

764
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,413
You forget about yourself
and you can almost feel what

765
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:17,615
they're feeling in their dreams.

766
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,284
Have you ever thought...

767
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,388
There's a whole other world
in somebody else's mind,

768
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:26,290
and there are about 6 billion
other minds out there...

769
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,760
Makes your perspective
seem rather insignificant.

770
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:32,563
I think a lot of people lack
perspective.

771
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:36,701
I see it every day, the
same empty salutations and

772
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:38,302
one line cliches.

773
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,837
MAN AT METRO: 
She must love you...

774
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:42,473
THE WAITER (V.O.)
Makes you wonder...

775
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:45,876
MAN AT METRO: 
I said, she must love you.

776
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,680
Love you enough to a marry a
muthafucker without a car.

777
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:54,318
Sit'en up here waitin' on the
train like the rest of us.

778
00:55:54,351 --> 00:56:00,658
Got a suit on and shit.
That some nice shoes...

779
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:05,830
I said that some nice shoes.
Where you get them from?

780
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,132
A shoe store or somethin'?

781
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,638
It's alright you ain't got to
talk.

782
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:16,373
Ol' upity muthafucker...

783
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:25,950
Have a nice day mutha fucker.

784
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:29,587
THE WAITER (V.O.) 
When someone wishes you to have
a nice day...

785
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,656
What would they sacrifice for a
stranger,

786
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,792
for them to really
have a nice day...?

787
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,594
Would they give
you a quarter?

788
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:39,029
Would they give
you a parking space?

789
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:44,869
Would they give their life?
Or even just like a smile?...

790
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:48,138
People that are imprisoned
seem to have perspective,

791
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:50,775
however when they're freed
for some reason all that

792
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:54,479
perspective goes
out the window...

793
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:57,848
I think it comes from
not being able to move...

794
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:01,519
when you can't move you
wait and you watch...

795
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:04,755
You really start to see people
and their true nature

796
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,557
and time...

797
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:11,462
And it's true nature just
moving.

798
00:57:11,496 --> 00:57:16,066
I feel like a prisoner...
My clock has no hands.

799
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,903
Life is just motionless...

800
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,972
I feel like I'm bound by
servitude that I chose

801
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,742
and in essence I'm
trapped in my own body...

802
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:29,446
It's much like how humanity has
largely trapped itself in cars.

803
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:32,016
(art gallery crowd noises)

804
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,851
VITO TIERI: 
Who's in charge here?

805
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,820
I need somebody that speaks
English!

806
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,622
Why isn't
this wine chilled properly?

807
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,190
CATERING MANAGER: 
I'm very sorry sir we'll take
care of it.

808
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:41,726
THE WAITER (V.O.)
Just think about it...

809
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:46,597
We move yet we are
essentially motionless.

810
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,033
People don't even realize
just sitting in their living

811
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,502
room on their couch...

812
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:55,506
They're traveling something like
67,000 miles a minute.

813
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,174
They're not even moving.

814
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,010
I have a desire yet not the
capacity

815
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:02,613
and there is the paradox.

816
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:08,485
Like a run away train, I'm the
conductor and can see the end

817
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,820
of the tracks.

818
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:15,092
Most people are too distracted
by the ride to realize...

819
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,194
the end's coming.

820
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,830
You know I wonder
if it's a blessing,

821
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:24,001
I suppose it
dissolves the tedium.

822
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,838
VINCENT TIERI: 
I can handle it.

823
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:30,040
MYSTERY MAN: 
You're playing with gas and
matches!

824
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:31,809
VINCENT TIERI: 
What the fuck do I care what
happens,

825
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,144
the whole fuckin' house could
come crashing down as far as

826
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:37,181
I'm concerned, I'm close
enough to watch and far

827
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:38,683
enough to not
hear the crash...

828
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:40,551
Hey, I'm clean.

829
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:43,520
No way any fucking
thing comes back on me...

830
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:45,055
MYSTERY MAN: 
Is it worth it?

831
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:48,092
VINCENT TIERI: 
I don't think about that shit.

832
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,060
I mean they're not smart
enough to get themselves out

833
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:51,962
of the fucking desert, we
didn't think they'd be smart

834
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,898
enough to do something like
that.

835
00:58:53,931 --> 00:59:00,237
MYSTERY MAN: 
They weren't... Without you...
And that's my point.

836
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:27,698
VITO TIERI: 
What the fuck.
Do you know who I am.

837
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,566
Do you know what you're doin?...

838
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:01,866
TIFFANY: 
So...

839
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:07,672
I still don't know who
you are or what you do...

840
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:19,817
THE WAITER: 
It's a short story... with no
end...

841
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,725
(distorted voices)

842
01:00:28,693 --> 01:00:29,760
Mercy.

843
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,899
(wind rages)
(distorted voices)

844
01:00:55,786 --> 01:00:57,287
(loud gunshot is heard)

845
01:00:58,288 --> 01:00:59,690
TIFFANY: 
It came from your apartment...

846
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:01,058
THE WAITER: 
Lock the door, stay here...

847
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,159
TIFFANY: 
What are you going to do...?

848
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,361
THE WAITER: 
Don't call the cops...

849
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,409
(choking on blood)

850
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,222
THE WAITER: 
It's ok. Who sent you?

851
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,396
Was it Hamilton?

852
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:42,800
(gunshot)

853
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:06,957
TIFFANY:
Leave me alone...
leave me alone!

854
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:09,827
THE WAITER: 
Tiffany...You don't understand
what's going on.

855
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,128
Let me explain...

856
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:15,933
TIFFANY: 
Understand?!
I don't want to understand!

857
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:21,405
THE WAITER: 
They were there to kill me.
Would you rather me be dead?

858
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,040
TIFFANY: 
Leave...

859
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,143
THE WAITER: 
Tiffany! Not everything's black
and white.

860
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:31,048
TIFFANY: 
Leave... Just go...
The cops are on their way...

861
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:34,418
THE WAITER: 
I told you not to call the cops.

862
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,386
TIFFANY: 
Just go...

863
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,255
THE WAITER: 
I'm sorry.

864
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,127
TIFFANY: 
It's too late for sorry...

865
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,862
(gunshot)

866
01:02:45,162 --> 01:02:48,432
(dark music plays)

867
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:22,486
HECTOR:
Hey white boy!
Remember me?

868
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:52,449
(Club music plays)

869
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:27,184
RUSSIAN THUG: 
Maleck, he's here.

870
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:31,621
LESTER MALECK 
Where the fuck you think you're
going? You got ID?

871
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:34,158
Check his ID I know
he ain't 21.

872
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:34,958
Go ahead check him...

873
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,560
CLUB DOORMAN:

874
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,998
LESTER MALECK: 
It's okay...

875
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,341
(loud thumping beats of club
techno music)

876
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:30,547
LESTER MALECK: 
Small world huh?

877
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:33,183
THE WAITER: 
Yeah...

878
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,688
LESTER MALECK:
I heard there was a guy causing
a lot of noise, I shouldn't be

879
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:42,392
surprised it was you...
Fuck up...

880
01:07:42,426 --> 01:07:45,462
THE WAITER: 
Looks like that retirement plan
didn't work out for ya...

881
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:49,699
To much Enron in the 401k?

882
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,368
LESTER MALECK:
That's life buddy,

883
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:54,037
taking jobs where
ever I can now.

884
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,740
THE WAITER: 
Looks like you found this one up
somebody's ass...

885
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:59,376
LESTER MALECK: 
Hey. It's just a fucking
paycheck.

886
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,410
THE WAITER: 
Just bustin' your balls,

887
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:02,246
We all got to slum it
sometime...

888
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:06,450
LESTER MALECK:
Listen you fuck!
Don't get it twisted...

889
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,718
There ain't no rag heads
anymore and there ain't no

890
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,086
sand in our boots...

891
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,088
And we ain't on
the same side.

892
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:15,058
I'll take you down
like a fucking dog!

893
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,693
Understand?

894
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,061
THE WAITER: 
Don't worry...

895
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,598
I wasn't confused
for a second...

896
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,074
LESTER MALECK: 
I always envied you.

897
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,109
THE WAITER: 
Why's that?

898
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:35,179
LESTER MALECK: 
Cuz I think ya got a screw loose

899
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:37,814
or you just got no soul at
all...

900
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:43,487
I kinda wanna think you got a
soul, cuz I like ya...

901
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,623
You always made me laugh.

902
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:03,106
I'm not going to be
around for the day...

903
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,742
But one day you're
gonna end up like me.

904
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:10,113
You know I got a bum
ticker from the old man.

905
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,548
And what?

906
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:15,118
A pocket full of worthless
tin medals and memories from

907
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,321
a war that should have been
lost and forgotten except for

908
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:18,555
losers like us?!

909
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:22,559
That have the reality and the
realization that our own were

910
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:25,495
getting killed...
Our own!

911
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,167
No...

912
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:35,272
I don't think so.

913
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:39,343
And now I'm workin' for
the same shit heads that we

914
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:42,178
fought 20 years ago.

915
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:46,583
So I can get a...
new hip so I can walk...

916
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:47,684
Why?

917
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:58,161
Because I want to fuckin' walk.
So you don't judge me!

918
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,599
Look at yourself.
Get your shit together.

919
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,308
THE WAITER: 
You make a pretty convincing
argument.

920
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:13,477
LESTER MALECK:
I hope so.

921
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:20,216
If you don't do something now,
you got problems.

922
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:25,188
Get your shit together.
Get out. Go.

923
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,790
THE WAITER: 
Where the fuck am I supposed to
go...?

924
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:31,194
LESTER MALECK: 
It's a big fucking world out
there kid.

925
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:36,199
What do you want to end up
like an old cog like me?...

926
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,602
When the machine chews you
up they spit you out and turn

927
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:48,345
you into scrap metal.
Look. We ain't friends...

928
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:52,215
But we ain't enemies either...

929
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:57,220
If you ever need me...
you come find me.

930
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,657
Now you look at yourself
and you look at that soul.

931
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:03,960
And I'm gonna say a prayer for
you. Fair enough?

932
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,647
LESTER MALECK:
I'll see ya...

933
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,982
Hey make sure
you frisk him too, will ya?

934
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,551
Don't forget to
check the sack.

935
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:30,387
It's where he likes
to hide his shit...

936
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,556
RUSSIAN THUG: 
I got you, boss.

937
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:43,266
LESTER MALECK: 
You're forgetting pieces about
yourself kid.

938
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:48,472
Remember you don't change now,
there won't be anything left.

939
01:11:48,505 --> 01:11:50,073
RUSSIAN THUG: 
He's clean.

940
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:59,649
THE WAITER: 
Take care of yourself Maleck.
I'll see you around someday.

941
01:11:59,683 --> 01:12:02,819
LESTER MALECK:
I'll be waitin' right here for
you princess.

942
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:19,736
SERGI: 
So glad to see you.
Please have a seat.

943
01:12:21,805 --> 01:12:23,440
IVAN (in Russian) 
Hey...Idiot...

944
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:27,944
RADINOFF (in Russian): 
Mind your own business!

945
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:33,383
SERGI: 
Drink.

946
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:37,353
It wasn't a question.

947
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:38,922
Is that for me?

948
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:41,691
THE WAITER: 
That depends, are we done?

949
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:43,593
SERGI:
Yes, of course...

950
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:44,994
(to other Russians)
I love this guy...

951
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:48,698
You tell him something to
do, he'll take care of it.

952
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:53,770
You know Americans are
only nothing but style.

953
01:12:53,803 --> 01:12:59,342
When I was in a Soviet army
my job was take picture of in

954
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,747
a neutral airspace, American
planes...

955
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,850
The pilots and
the serial numbers.

956
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,620
Those American pilots, they used
to take their helmet off,

957
01:13:10,654 --> 01:13:15,625
comb their hair, and after then
they say take my picture now...

958
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:20,697
I said this is cool, you know...
I have to go to America.

959
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,398
(laughter)

960
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:28,404
SERGI:
Do you know what I wanted to do,
I want to become a movie star...

961
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:35,011
Cold War was gone and I saw
there is another opportunity...

962
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:38,381
World needs more Kolichnakovs,

963
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:43,787
machine guns, so I moved to
America... Now look at me...

964
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,388
What was your question?

965
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,389
THE WAITER: 
Are we done?

966
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,557
SERGI: 
We're done...

967
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:50,560
As soon as you take
care of the little girl.

968
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:53,396
THE WAITER: 
She didn't see anything.

969
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:59,536
SERGI: 
Clean up your shit...
Are we clear?

970
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:01,404
Not your fault,

971
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:06,776
Hamilton fucked up. We
know he was gonna screw us...

972
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:07,777
THE WAITER: 
You knew?

973
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:09,412
SERGI: 
We know everything...

974
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:14,417
We know Hamilton was
gonna have you killed...

975
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,085
THE WAITER: 
Thanks for telling me.

976
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:22,425
SERGI: 
We want to see how good you
are... Knowledge is a power...

977
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:27,096
Did you know you had access
to 40 million dollars in your

978
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:32,669
breiefcase... I bet you wish
you knew that...

979
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:37,440
You would asked
for more money....

980
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,609
There is one thing we don't
know...

981
01:14:39,643 --> 01:14:40,744
THE WAITER: 
And that is...?

982
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:44,447
SERGI: 
Kinsky is gone.
Do you know where he is?

983
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,281
THE WAITER: 
No.

984
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,551
SERGI: 
Did Hamilton mention him?

985
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:48,985
THE WAITER: 
I don't remember.

986
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:51,888
SERGI: 
Kinsky is not to be harmed.

987
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:55,792
If he's harmed, we
gonna come and see you...

988
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:56,793
THE WAITER: 
And why is that?

989
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:59,495
SERGI: 
For your services of course...

990
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:03,466
We have agreement...
You kill the girl. So...

991
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,770
Now... Do you want a drink?

992
01:15:06,803 --> 01:15:07,837
THE WAITER: 
No.

993
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:09,739
SERGI: 
Then get the fuck out...

994
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:13,877
IVAN: 
My money is on Hamilton kills
him...

995
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,613
SERGI: 
You are a Greek, I can tell...

996
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:21,517
Greeks use to run the ports of
Houston... They built this town.

997
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:26,522
That's why there are so
many titty bars in this town!

998
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:32,095
In the 80's FBI, they ran them
out. They regret it now...

999
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:34,497
Do you know why?

1000
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,532
Because the Greeks cared...

1001
01:15:36,566 --> 01:15:41,871
I don't give a fuck if it's a
little girl or fucking puppy.

1002
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:46,042
I'm here..
I'll take care of it.

1003
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,623
Get out!

1004
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:32,188
LESTER MALECK: 
Ah, you Sonofabitch fucking
asshole...

1005
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:39,162
If your gonna do it, do it.
Do it.

1006
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:42,666
If I don't finish this job
I'm as good as dead anyway.

1007
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,570
Hey kid...

1008
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,709
It's the last run...
It's the last run...

1009
01:16:52,742 --> 01:16:57,914
THE WAITER: 
No... I'm taking your advice.
You should do the same...

1010
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,050
It's a big fucking world
brother.

1011
01:17:11,695 --> 01:17:13,830
LESTER MALECK: 
Yeah.

1012
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,619
THE WAITER: 
Everybody stay where you are.
You move, you die.

1013
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,922
SERGI: 
Ivan already left with the case.

1014
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:42,992
THE WAITER:
I didn't come for the case,
I came to clarify something.

1015
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:44,928
You're not going to
touch that little girl.

1016
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,629
Are you?

1017
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,098
SERGI: 
Is that a question?

1018
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,069
I'll make sure
she screams when I...

1019
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,337
(multiple gunshots)

1020
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,344
THE WAITER: 
You leave this room,
you die.

1021
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:36,279
THE WAITER: 
Hey laughing boy.

1022
01:18:36,312 --> 01:18:38,481
I'm gonna need that case.

1023
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,854
Well then I'm gonna need the key
too.

1024
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:50,693
Don't make this difficult.

1025
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,028
I'm already runnin' out of
bullets, killing all your

1026
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,864
friends...

1027
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:59,168
(gunshot)

1028
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:03,406
(grunts of pain)

1029
01:19:05,108 --> 01:19:06,475
IVAN (OS): 
What are you waiting for?

1030
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:09,813
THE WAITER:
Why didn't you just give me the
key.

1031
01:19:09,846 --> 01:19:13,082
(gun misfires)

1032
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:16,252
I guess you're fat AND unlucky.

1033
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:09,906
(calm, jazzy music plays)

1034
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,061
DRIVER
Fuck you, asshole!

1035
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,618
(gunshots)

1036
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:53,909
THE WAITER: 
You shouldn't have opened the
case. I want a name.

1037
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:55,478
(gunshot)

1038
01:21:57,613 --> 01:22:01,484
(harps swell)
(dream-like trance music)

1039
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:17,566
FEMALE VOICE:
Peace.

1040
01:22:55,104 --> 01:23:00,376
THE WAITER: 
Sorry I startled you.

1041
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:03,946
Did you think it was
the Holy Ghost this time?

1042
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,416
PRIEST: 
Actually I was thinking Jesus.

1043
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,958
THE WAITER: 
I'm sorry for the burden I put
on you...

1044
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:20,963
PRIEST: 
Burden is yours, and I'm the one
who's truly sorry.

1045
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,966
THE WAITER: 
No, I told you too much.

1046
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:28,971
PRIEST: 
No, your words and deeds are
between you and the Lord.

1047
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,175
And no burden is too great for
Him.

1048
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:35,111
THE WAITER: 
You don't understand.

1049
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:40,649
PRIEST: 
Yes, I do...

1050
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,794
Yes I do.

1051
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:57,032
YES, I do.

1052
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:29,532
THE CEO: 
Christ!

1053
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:32,235
You scared the
hell out of me...

1054
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:38,107
Do, uh... Do you have 
an appointment?

1055
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,218
I think you better leave...

1056
01:24:49,252 --> 01:24:51,053
I've just pushed the security
alarm...

1057
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,421
The guards will be
here in a few minutes.

1058
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:55,424
THE WAITER: 
And you'll be dead by the time
they get here.

1059
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:56,792
THE CEO: 
Are you crazy?

1060
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,361
Is this some kind of a sick
joke...

1061
01:24:58,394 --> 01:24:59,728
What do you want?

1062
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,330
THE WAITER: 
I want to know was it worth
it...

1063
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:02,565
THE CEO: 
What?

1064
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:06,569
THE WAITER: 
All those innocent people died.
And for what?

1065
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,737
So you can have
some more money?

1066
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:12,074
I've given all the
papers to Ford Bynum's widow.

1067
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,310
And I want to know
was it worth it?

1068
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:16,145
What's the difference between
having a hundred million and

1069
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:18,381
20 million in your bank?

1070
01:25:18,414 --> 01:25:21,617
THE CEO: 
What the hell are you talking
about...

1071
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,256
No don't... Please....
Please put that down..

1072
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:34,397
Don't... Please put that...
Oh God.... No please....

1073
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,098
(gags)

1074
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,566
(falls onto desk)

1075
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:51,146
(triumphant ballad plays)
