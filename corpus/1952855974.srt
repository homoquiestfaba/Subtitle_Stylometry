3
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,247
The Hammer of Invincibility.

4
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:38,619
The demon way.

5
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:41,322
Condor.

6
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,693
Ragnerok.

7
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:47,363
The Hammer of Invincibility.

8
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:51,802
Odin.

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,844
Open...

10
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:00,514
Gateway....

11
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:02,683
To Asgard!

12
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:09,723
[Rumbling]

13
00:02:30,112 --> 00:02:31,947
Loki!

14
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:45,996
'Tis the demon Loki!

15
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:48,899
All off
his radial bows!

16
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,567
Fire at the ready!

17
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:52,936
Stand your ground
in the name of Odin!

18
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:54,037
Fire!

19
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,030
[Screaming]

20
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,844
This portends to be
an evil day.

21
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,889
Baldir?

22
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,092
Why did the Norns
summon father?

23
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,161
The weavers of fate
will tell father soon enough.

24
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,801
Now hurry. The gate
will be closed soon.

25
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,535
[Rumbling]

26
00:04:39,216 --> 00:04:41,451
Father!

27
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,953
Some evil is upon us.

28
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:46,222
I must go see the Norns.

29
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,057
We'll go with you,
father.

30
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,625
I must do this alone.

31
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,695
You return
to the safety of Valhalla.

32
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,632
Come on.

33
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,780
Hurry, or the gate
will close. Come on.

34
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:27,863
Send them deep into Hell!

35
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,774
So their doom
has spread its plume.

36
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,043
And none too soon.

37
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,878
And none too soon.

38
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:53,656
It is a dark day,
Odin, King of Asgard,

39
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:55,658
that we summon you here
to see us.

40
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,826
I would come
for no one else.

41
00:05:57,894 --> 00:06:01,329
Now speak your minds
and be done with it.

42
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:05,835
I have dreamt
of the stars in the sky

43
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:07,236
turning black.

44
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:09,505
What does this mean?

45
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,641
It is a countdown.

46
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,110
A countdown to what?

47
00:06:13,177 --> 00:06:15,946
Have you brought the Hammer
of Invincibility?

48
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:20,518
This Hammer was forged
by my father

49
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:24,890
from the center
of the Tree of Life.

50
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,760
His power
is in this Hammer.

51
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,061
That Hammer
is the only weapon

52
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,997
that can kill the mighty
tree it came from.

53
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,565
The source of life

54
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,568
on which the mortal earth
and all other worlds depend.

55
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,071
Now Loki has arrived
to take that life.

56
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:41,541
So you must give the
Hammer of Invincibility to him.

57
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,277
To Loki? Never.

58
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:46,513
The time has come
for Ragnerok.

59
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,483
Before the Sun
goes down this day

60
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,552
it will be the destruction
of all worlds.

61
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,354
Of Asgard, Earth,

62
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:55,757
and all the other
worlds as well.

63
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:58,294
And you are powerless
to stop it.

64
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,396
We'll see about that.

65
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,503
Thor, come on.

66
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,180
Is this fate?

67
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:21,049
Destroy one world...

68
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:23,618
then weave another.

69
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:25,821
That is how it's done.

70
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:27,590
Your doom is decided...

71
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,793
And the fall of your kingdom
has already begun.

72
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,203
I don't believe in fate.

73
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:59,890
[Growling]

74
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,239
Find me the Hammer
of Invincibility,

75
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,440
my Garmr,

76
00:08:17,508 --> 00:08:20,010
and this world will be
yours to control.

77
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:24,981
Onward to Valhalla.

78
00:08:37,794 --> 00:08:41,730
[Blows warning]

79
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,670
To arms! To arms!

80
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,372
Invasion!

81
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,807
Someone approaches
from the north!

82
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,242
Drop the gates now!

83
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:14,632
Wait!

84
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,770
We don't have
to listen to them.

85
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:20,772
We can weave
our own fate.

86
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,307
We can control
our destiny.

87
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:24,442
That is why you
are the younger brother.

88
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,510
We can't give up.

89
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:29,280
A God of the Aesir
never gives up.

90
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,782
I will face my own death
with honor and dignity,

91
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,585
and I suggest
you do the same.

92
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,020
Enough!

93
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:48,667
I want to see Odin!

94
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:50,836
Odin will never
speak to you.

95
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:53,438
I want the Hammer
of Invincibility.

96
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,709
The Hammer is not yours
to take.

97
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:14,595
Odin!

98
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:22,869
Odin!

99
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:35,680
I want the Hammer!

100
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:52,362
Our fate is upon us.

101
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,998
You two fly at
the creatures to the left.

102
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,767
I'll cut down
through the center.

103
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,302
We'll meet in the middle.

104
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:59,269
Yes, father.

105
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,904
Yes, father.

106
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:03,841
You stay back
behind your brother.

107
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:05,809
But father, I can fight.

108
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:08,379
I'm not afraid.

109
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:11,316
No, son. I question
not your heart,

110
00:11:11,383 --> 00:11:12,617
but your experience.

111
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,085
I need you at the end
of the battle.

112
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,354
I need you
for the finish.

113
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:16,756
Yes, father.

114
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,361
Valor and strength.

115
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:22,762
Valor and strength.

116
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,034
Valor and strength.

117
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:30,302
Valor and strength.

118
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:01,936
Thor!

119
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:43,812
Where is Thor?

120
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,580
He was by my side,
I swear.

121
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,515
Suddenly he was gone.

122
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:53,520
I wanted to die
with both my sons.

123
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,364
Odin!

124
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,832
Loki!

125
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,339
Do not think
I'll lie and die for you.

126
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:30,462
You can't stop
the future, Odin.

127
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,064
Give me the Hammer.

128
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:34,899
You know
it's your fate.

129
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,205
Just give me
the Hammer, Odin.

130
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,406
Just give me the Hammer.

131
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:18,841
We don't have
to go through this,

132
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:20,509
and I'll go away.

133
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,946
I'll just go away.

134
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:33,652
Loki!

135
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:45,597
No! No!

136
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:49,367
No! No!

137
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:51,703
My son!

138
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,075
Father...

139
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,247
Give Thor a chance...

140
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:06,217
To change...

141
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:07,752
Our fate.

142
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,303
Finally now it's mine.

143
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,653
You want this?

144
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,158
Back where you came!

145
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:02,273
Tell me.
Tell me where you sent it!

146
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:16,219
Find it.

147
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,221
Search every cave,

148
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,258
every tree in Asgard.

149
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:33,869
Now.

150
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:28,732
<i>[coughing]</i>

151
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,974
No! No!

152
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:43,280
I'm sorry.

153
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:48,084
I'm sorry.

154
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,720
Brother?

155
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:52,488
What should I do?

156
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,660
Father!

157
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,662
Father.

158
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,464
Thor.

159
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,633
Live.

160
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,335
You live.

161
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,137
Yes. Where's your
potion of healing, father?

162
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:10,471
No.

163
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:11,539
Where's your potion?

164
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:13,274
There's not time
for that, my son.

165
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,242
It's too late.
Don't waste it.

166
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,945
Use it
for another cause.

167
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,916
My father's Hammer...

168
00:18:24,785 --> 00:18:26,686
I sent it...

169
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:29,756
to the heart
of the Tree of Life.

170
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,824
My son...

171
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,995
must alone
retrieve it...

172
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,496
before Loki.

173
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:39,432
Forget the Hammer,
father.

174
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,934
It's Loki I want,

175
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,268
to avenge your death.

176
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:44,103
My brother's.

177
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:47,040
My son...

178
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,509
you still think
with your heart,

179
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,444
not your mind.

180
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:53,814
The Hammer
will appear...

181
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,021
on the first
full moon...

182
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,824
Tomorrow...

183
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,860
For a moment.

184
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:08,263
If you don't
retrieve it,

185
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:12,834
it's lost forever.

186
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,602
You must
retrieve it, my son.

187
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,437
Yes, father.

188
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:19,206
You are King.
You are our chance

189
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:21,207
to save all
that is good.

190
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:23,343
To change
the fate of men.

191
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:27,848
To change the fate
of the gods.

192
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,020
Thor...

193
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:36,658
You are my son.

194
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,077
Loki!

195
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,048
Loki!

196
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:20,406
Loki!

197
00:20:20,473 --> 00:20:22,708
Come out and fight me,
you coward!

198
00:20:44,329 --> 00:20:46,697
Now the real coward
is on his back,

199
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:50,167
just like Odin
after I killed him.

200
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,536
You should have heard
your father beg.

201
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:54,605
My father wouldn't
ask a thing from you.

202
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:56,807
Oh, he cried.

203
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,043
He pleaded
don't hurt me.

204
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,645
Liar!

205
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:02,780
You are the coward!

206
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:04,048
Fight me
like a warrior.

207
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:11,688
Tell me where the Hammer
of Invincibility is.

208
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:14,724
Release me and fight!

209
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:19,094
Your father spoke to you
with his last breath.

210
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:21,596
I can smell it.

211
00:21:21,664 --> 00:21:23,831
What did he say?

212
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:29,505
He said that you're as
worthless as your dogs.

213
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,661
Let's go!
Let's go! Move!

214
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,267
Who are you?

215
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:27,269
Come on!
Come on! Move!

216
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:28,703
Why are you
helping me?

217
00:22:28,771 --> 00:22:30,505
Move!

218
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:38,612
Find them.

219
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:40,680
Kill the girl
any way you like,

220
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:43,416
but Thor lives for now.

221
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:45,252
Go!

222
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,520
Go!

223
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,006
All right.

224
00:23:05,074 --> 00:23:06,173
Shh!

225
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:07,975
I'm Thor.

226
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:09,677
I know.

227
00:23:09,744 --> 00:23:10,811
Who are you?

228
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,947
I'm Jarnsaxa.

229
00:23:13,014 --> 00:23:14,615
I'm a servant
of your father.

230
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:15,783
He asked me
to protect you.

231
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,651
Then let's avenge
my father's death.

232
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:18,619
I can't kill Loki alone,

233
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:19,687
and you do not yet have

234
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:20,788
the fighting skills
to help.

235
00:23:20,856 --> 00:23:21,989
Shh!
You don't know my--

236
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,390
[growling]

237
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:24,591
Quiet!
What?

238
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,434
Come on.
It's time we go.

239
00:23:34,502 --> 00:23:37,370
Come on. This is
a battle we cannot win.

240
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:39,806
We must hide.

241
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:49,014
Odin!

242
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:52,418
Odin!

243
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:55,687
Your world is over.

244
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:58,891
Mine is next.

245
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,760
And your Tree of Life
is finished.

246
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:09,602
Ah, my pet.

247
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,273
You found them.

248
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:15,342
Now lead me.

249
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:28,507
I'm not going
to keep running

250
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,509
from Loki
like some coward.

251
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:32,778
You think you're ready
to fight Loki? Huh?

252
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,946
Yes.

253
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,614
Yes.

254
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,483
I'm not going to fight
some girl.

255
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:49,162
I am a fraction
of your size

256
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:53,132
and I managed
to best you three times.

257
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,366
Here.

258
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,114
Clear?

259
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:10,182
Huh?

260
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,550
Fine.

261
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,020
There it is.

262
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:15,956
Come on.
The portal is open.

263
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:16,990
Hurry!

264
00:25:28,369 --> 00:25:30,838
Make this land
a chasm of death.

265
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:47,321
Stop! Stop!

266
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:49,590
What?

267
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:51,826
What is this place?

268
00:25:51,894 --> 00:25:53,394
It's a training camp

269
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:55,296
protected by
a powerful rune stone

270
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:56,798
far older than Loki.

271
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:59,134
No enemy
can enter uninvited.

272
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:00,502
We must go
to the gateway.

273
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,937
Come on!

274
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:03,605
What gateway?

275
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:07,975
To the Tree of Life
to get the Hammer.

276
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,476
It can't be.

277
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:11,044
This is a secret place.

278
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,846
How could Loki
have destroyed it?

279
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:15,182
Destroyed what?

280
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:17,317
A direct portal to Midgard.

281
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:18,385
Perhaps the Norns

282
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,387
had something
to do with this.

283
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,022
The Norns? But they're
neutral in these matters.

284
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,590
I'm not so sure.

285
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:26,927
Thor!

286
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:31,565
I can hear you.

287
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:35,436
Why delay the inevitable?

288
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:36,938
Where is he?

289
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:39,207
He's outside
the protective barrier

290
00:26:39,274 --> 00:26:40,308
of the rune stone.

291
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:41,576
I don't see him.

292
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:43,645
Nor he us.

293
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:47,949
Odin is gone.

294
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:51,453
I will possess the Hammer.

295
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:53,789
We should take
the fight to him.

296
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:55,791
How can we fight Loki

297
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:57,826
if the fates
are against us?

298
00:26:57,894 --> 00:26:59,695
I don't believe in fate.

299
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:02,831
Loki: Coward, where are you?

300
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,502
You wanna play games?

301
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:16,645
I have games of my own
I can play.

302
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:19,147
Come, my friends.

303
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:21,749
We're trapped.

304
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:24,252
Our only chance
is to wait until nightfall

305
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,087
and then we sneak
out of here.

306
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:28,422
A warrior God doesn't
sneak around at night.

307
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,891
A warrior uses his cunning
and temperance

308
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,326
to win a battle.

309
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,066
And one of these...

310
00:27:41,435 --> 00:27:43,436
Swung with skill.

311
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,040
I swing hard enough.

312
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:49,342
Skill, even above strength.

313
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:52,712
Who taught you
how to fight?

314
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:58,784
I taught myself...

315
00:27:58,852 --> 00:28:01,287
By watching my brother
practice when I was small.

316
00:28:01,355 --> 00:28:02,889
Who taught you?

317
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,927
The Valkyries,

318
00:28:06,995 --> 00:28:10,431
warrior-guardian
of the gods.

319
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:15,137
I was second in command
under Odin's father.

320
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:17,873
Hmm.

321
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:19,908
Swing.

322
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:26,581
Not again.

323
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:31,219
Skill above strength.

324
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:32,821
Swing.

325
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:43,231
You have no chance
against Loki

326
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:45,367
unless you learn
the skills I have.

327
00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:46,768
Then you better
teach me quick,

328
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:48,036
'cause I'm going
to kill Loki

329
00:28:48,104 --> 00:28:50,139
the first chance I get.

330
00:28:55,446 --> 00:28:56,679
Thor?

331
00:28:56,747 --> 00:28:59,249
I can hear you.

332
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:21,807
Come, my friends!

333
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:26,545
This is
much more comfortable.

334
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:29,448
[Explosion]

335
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:32,618
What is that?

336
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:36,122
[Rumbling]

337
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:38,057
They're coming.

338
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,291
I thought you said

339
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,426
nothing could come in here
uninvited.

340
00:29:40,494 --> 00:29:42,861
I think I was wrong.

341
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:43,962
What?

342
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:05,450
We must find
the other gateway.

343
00:30:05,517 --> 00:30:07,185
Wait! Wait! Wait!

344
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:08,620
There isn't time.

345
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:09,988
Loki's probably
on to us.

346
00:30:10,056 --> 00:30:12,491
Then I say we ambush 'em
at the next bend,

347
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,193
kill him,
and be done with it.

348
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,395
Look, even with
all you've learned,

349
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,398
we're still not a match
for his powers.

350
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:19,532
We have to go
to Midgard.

351
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,466
From there's
we'll find a way

352
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:21,567
to the Tree of Life.

353
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:23,569
But the portal was destroyed.

354
00:30:23,637 --> 00:30:25,938
There is another
entrance. Come on!

355
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:04,276
Look what I let them do
to my father's land.

356
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,547
Asgard was doomed
as soon as Odin died.

357
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:12,516
You have a different
world to save.

358
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,788
Look!

359
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:22,559
Look!

360
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:25,128
New life already
begins to grow.

361
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:28,365
There is hope after all.

362
00:31:32,738 --> 00:31:34,372
Come on.

363
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,242
The gateway is just
beyond these trees.

364
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:41,481
[Growling]

365
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,954
[Growling]

366
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,294
No, no, no. No!

367
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,879
Thor!

368
00:32:10,946 --> 00:32:12,480
It didn't have
to be this way.

369
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:14,750
Could have died
without her, Thor.

370
00:32:14,817 --> 00:32:17,419
You want the Hammer
of Invincibility?

371
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:19,688
Here. Take it!

372
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:23,592
Go!

373
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:25,728
Go!

374
00:32:45,148 --> 00:32:47,016
Yes.

375
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:55,091
No!

376
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:16,311
Thor?

377
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:17,545
Tell me that was not
the Hammer

378
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:18,880
you gave to Loki.

379
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:20,581
Of course I didn't.

380
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:21,582
I saw it!

381
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,816
It was always the ax.

382
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,384
I only made him think
that it was the Hammer.

383
00:33:24,452 --> 00:33:25,385
But I saw it.

384
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:26,720
You were within range.

385
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:27,855
Come on.

386
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,890
Loki can't be
far behind.

387
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:44,371
My place
is right up here.

388
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:22,677
Give me your purse.

389
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:23,845
No.

390
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:24,946
I said give me your purse.

391
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:27,516
[Thor clears throat]

392
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,419
Thank you.

393
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,957
Now you gotta pay.

394
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:36,726
Give me your wallet.

395
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,367
Thor, we don't want
to be noticed like this.

396
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:46,780
Come on. Let's go.

397
00:34:54,244 --> 00:34:55,445
This way. This way.

398
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,880
Go!

399
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,157
This does not
seem like

400
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:09,627
the dwelling
of a demigoddess.

401
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:10,962
It's not supposed to.

402
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,298
The people here
must think I'm human.

403
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:18,504
They don't believe in
the Tree of Life anymore.

404
00:35:18,571 --> 00:35:20,072
Here. Wear this.

405
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,007
You'll be less conspicuous.

406
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,180
Here. Take this.

407
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:29,781
Careful.
These are very powerful.

408
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,284
It's from Midgard.

409
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:33,718
How do you use it?

410
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:39,556
Here. Just put
your finger here.

411
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:41,725
This one goes up here.

412
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:44,862
Good. Be sure
this is pulled.

413
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:48,132
Now pull the trigger.

414
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:55,106
Just think of it
as the shaft of a spear,

415
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:57,508
and aim your point

416
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,110
at the center
of your target.

417
00:36:02,882 --> 00:36:04,315
Good.

418
00:36:04,383 --> 00:36:06,917
Your humans certainly
understand their weaponry.

419
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:08,586
They're warriors...

420
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:10,287
like the gods.

421
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:15,292
I'm beginning to like
your humans even more.

422
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:36,482
We are...here.

423
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,284
And the nearest channel

424
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:41,855
to the heart
of the tree is here.

425
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:44,323
But we're going to have
to open it ourselves.

426
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:46,292
How?

427
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,161
The tree will tell us how
when the time comes.

428
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:51,797
We could wait until
the dark of the night.

429
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:54,300
Let's do it.

430
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:55,734
Hmm.

431
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:57,736
Or we could leave now.

432
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:07,602
To get the Hammer,

433
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:08,669
we must pass through
the gateway portal

434
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:11,439
to the Tree of Life.

435
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,742
Right there.

436
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:45,809
Here it is.

437
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,178
The opening
has been covered up.

438
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:56,620
Can you feel anything?

439
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,255
A wall.

440
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,990
Well, we must enter
the portal now

441
00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:02,325
or we won't get
to the Hammer in time.

442
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,861
It will just disappear.

443
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:06,596
And go back to Loki.

444
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,773
Here.

445
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,742
Yes. Yes.
It's under this.

446
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,211
We have to uncover it.

447
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:22,549
[Speaking foreign language]

448
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:26,487
Thor, I need you.

449
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:27,654
I'm here.

450
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:29,022
Concentrate with me.

451
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,958
We need a strong channel
through us to open it.

452
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:35,729
Gateway.

453
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:37,130
Gateway.

454
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:40,501
Gateway!

455
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,773
Let's go.

456
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:50,344
Ready?

457
00:40:58,854 --> 00:41:01,289
You feel it?

458
00:41:01,356 --> 00:41:04,091
The presence of the
essence of all life,

459
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,360
right down
to her beating heart.

460
00:41:06,428 --> 00:41:08,362
[Pounding]

461
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,164
What is that?

462
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:13,268
It's the heart beat.

463
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:14,969
It's coming
from down in there.

464
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,704
Wait. Wait.

465
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:19,707
What if it's a trap?

466
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,876
You should stay.

467
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:24,779
Why?

468
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:26,081
Thor, if you die,

469
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,049
it's over for all of us.

470
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:29,651
We go together.

471
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,121
All right.

472
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:41,528
You cannot escape me, Thor.

473
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:44,499
I will possess the Hammer
of Invincibility.

474
00:41:44,566 --> 00:41:47,435
[Pounding]

475
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,052
The heart is on
the other side,

476
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,287
and the Hammer with it.

477
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,156
Pass through
and you will be there.

478
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,598
Aren't you coming?

479
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:16,868
This part of the journey
is for you alone.

480
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:18,204
There is a knight

481
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:19,705
who guards
the Tree of Life.

482
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:22,074
You must defeat him
at all costs.

483
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:50,586
The heart of the tree.

484
00:46:31,262 --> 00:46:33,896
Where is it?

485
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:35,464
Where is the Hammer?

486
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:37,266
Thor!

487
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:38,768
Father?

488
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:40,903
Thor, my son,

489
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:44,507
the power of my fathers
is now in you.

490
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:46,276
Use the Hammer.

491
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:48,845
Find it.

492
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:50,514
Take this Hammer, son,

493
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:53,317
the power is now yours.

494
00:46:53,385 --> 00:46:55,552
It's yours.

495
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:14,573
Oh, great Tree of Life,

496
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:15,941
thank you

497
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:18,076
from my heart

498
00:47:18,144 --> 00:47:20,279
for all that you
have given us.

499
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:26,251
Give me the strength

500
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,120
so that I might save you
from destruction.

501
00:47:59,788 --> 00:48:01,488
How will Loki know
we've returned?

502
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:02,756
He'll know.

503
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:04,958
We must lure him
back to Asgard.

504
00:48:05,026 --> 00:48:07,360
I'm going to track
Loki down and kill him.

505
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:09,596
You're not ready
to face Loki yet.

506
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:11,498
Why? I have the Hammer.

507
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:13,867
I have the will.
What more do I need?

508
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:15,469
The powers
of your father.

509
00:48:15,537 --> 00:48:17,738
A strategy. An army.

510
00:48:17,806 --> 00:48:19,741
Well, I don't have an army,

511
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:22,477
so I guess I'm on my own.

512
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:24,346
You're not
on your own, Thor.

513
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:29,985
You should stay
far away from me.

514
00:48:30,053 --> 00:48:33,222
Loki is more likely
to appear when I'm alone.

515
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,757
Do you trust me, Thor?

516
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:37,059
Yes.

517
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,061
We should go back
to the war camp.

518
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,529
The war camp? Why?

519
00:48:40,596 --> 00:48:41,696
To continue
your training.

520
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:42,764
We will need
its protection

521
00:48:42,831 --> 00:48:44,465
so one day
you can defeat Loki.

522
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:45,633
One day?

523
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,135
I have to defeat Loki now.

524
00:48:47,202 --> 00:48:49,003
You're not ready yet.

525
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:50,871
We should go back
to the war camp.

526
00:48:50,939 --> 00:48:52,273
Well, we don't have
to go back there.

527
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,708
I took the rune stone
of protection

528
00:48:53,775 --> 00:48:55,643
and put it inside
your dwelling place.

529
00:48:55,711 --> 00:48:57,345
Good.

530
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:58,980
Then we'll go back
to my dwelling

531
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,783
and safely finish
your training there.

532
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:02,451
No training!
No hiding!

533
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,554
I kill Loki
and stop Ragnerok,

534
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:05,755
and that's final.

535
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:27,675
I know Loki's in here.

536
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,157
Loki!

537
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,395
Come out and face me, Loki!

538
00:49:47,462 --> 00:49:50,264
Son of Odin.

539
00:49:50,331 --> 00:49:52,966
You're no match
for me.

540
00:49:56,337 --> 00:49:57,804
The Hammer
of Invincibility.

541
00:49:57,872 --> 00:49:59,605
Defend yourself, Loki.

542
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:02,542
Aah!

543
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:11,016
Let's go.

544
00:50:21,795 --> 00:50:23,496
I'm sorry.

545
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:26,366
I should have hit him
when I had the chance.

546
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:31,405
You're brave.

547
00:50:31,473 --> 00:50:33,708
Rash, stubborn,

548
00:50:33,776 --> 00:50:35,177
but brave.

549
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:43,418
Wait here. I'll check
the perimeter.

550
00:50:43,486 --> 00:50:46,421
Jarnsaxa...

551
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:49,924
You are a noble warrior.

552
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:51,325
I thank you.

553
00:51:00,669 --> 00:51:03,537
[Rumbling]

554
00:51:09,845 --> 00:51:11,913
He's close.

555
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:15,184
Good. This time I'll be
happy to hit him in the back.

556
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:16,585
No! No!

557
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,755
You were nearly
destroyed earlier.

558
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,758
You almost lost
the Hammer.

559
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:25,696
Well, it won't happen again.

560
00:51:25,764 --> 00:51:28,266
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

561
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,450
Loki: Jarnsaxa
cannot be trusted.

562
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:48,486
She has kissed the demons.

563
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:51,756
She is a concubine
for Midgard.

564
00:51:51,824 --> 00:51:52,924
You must kill her.

565
00:51:52,992 --> 00:51:54,292
Thor?

566
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,195
Loki: She only wants
the Hammer.

567
00:51:57,263 --> 00:51:58,664
Kill her.

568
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:00,232
Thor, do not listen to him.

569
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,300
He's playing mind tricks.

570
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,302
He's the devil,
the serpent,

571
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,571
the spirit of trickery
and deception.

572
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:07,606
Thor!

573
00:52:07,674 --> 00:52:09,541
Thor!

574
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:12,278
We must go back
to my dwelling,

575
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:13,646
to the protection
of the rune stone.

576
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,681
No! We can kill him.
I swear it.

577
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:16,949
Thor, please!

578
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:18,617
No!

579
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:19,885
Thor!

580
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:44,809
This is madness.

581
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:46,579
He's a liar, a cheater.

582
00:52:46,604 --> 00:52:48,172
Do not believe what you see.

583
00:52:58,266 --> 00:53:00,200
Maybe the Norns were right.

584
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:02,769
Maybe the Earth is doomed.

585
00:53:02,837 --> 00:53:05,704
I will not
let that happen.

586
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:08,374
I will not let the Norns
control my fate...

587
00:53:11,845 --> 00:53:13,545
or yours.

588
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:15,714
We can't kill Loki.

589
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:17,850
Not two of us,
not ten of us.

590
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:20,553
We must hide the Hammer
as Odin did.

591
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,555
For how long?

592
00:53:23,623 --> 00:53:25,958
Maybe centuries.

593
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:28,127
However long it takes
for you to be made ready.

594
00:53:28,195 --> 00:53:30,062
But everything will die.

595
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,933
No matter what Loki does
to men and gods,

596
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:36,203
as long as the Tree of Life
remains strong

597
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,606
all the other can be rebuilt.

598
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,477
At nightfall, then,
we return

599
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:45,479
to the protection
of our hiding place.

600
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:50,050
You have the courage of your
father and brother in you.

601
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:05,064
You have my heart,
Jarnsaxa.

602
00:54:05,132 --> 00:54:07,233
Know that.

603
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:09,836
And you have mine.

604
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:23,951
One day,
you will be able

605
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:25,852
to channel the powers
of the universe,

606
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,190
to let it fly through
your arm like lightning.

607
00:54:32,627 --> 00:54:34,828
Thor?

608
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,197
Oh, no. Thor!

609
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,420
Got you.

610
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:26,381
Give me
the Hammer, Thor.

611
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:32,922
Good. Use it.

612
00:55:32,989 --> 00:55:34,891
Feel the power
of the Hammer.

613
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,082
The bone of Urrl.

614
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:32,183
It is useless to you.

615
00:56:32,251 --> 00:56:34,986
You cannot control
it's power.

616
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,493
And without it,
you have no power at all.

617
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:42,828
Wait!

618
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:44,129
You will destroy
the only thing

619
00:56:44,197 --> 00:56:46,031
that can bring back
your father.

620
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:48,500
What do you mean?

621
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:49,802
Speak!

622
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:54,340
Your father.
Your brother.

623
00:56:54,407 --> 00:56:55,841
The power of the bone
is the only thing

624
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:58,077
that put them
in Muspellheim Hell,

625
00:56:58,144 --> 00:57:00,879
and it's the only thing
that can release them.

626
00:57:00,947 --> 00:57:03,048
Tell me how to use it.

627
00:57:03,116 --> 00:57:04,783
Tell me!

628
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:07,720
Let me live,
and I will show you.

629
00:57:07,787 --> 00:57:10,422
What of Ragnerok?

630
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,525
I'll make it that
there is no Ragnerok.

631
00:57:12,592 --> 00:57:14,594
No Ragnerok ever.

632
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:17,597
You are the devil,
full of lies and deceits.

633
00:57:17,664 --> 00:57:20,834
Aah!

634
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:24,004
Aah!

635
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:25,339
There is no Ragnerok.

636
00:57:25,406 --> 00:57:29,076
Aah!

637
00:57:29,143 --> 00:57:30,944
You are all safe.

638
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:33,113
You are all safe.

639
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:37,084
Give me back the bone
so I can live.

640
00:57:37,152 --> 00:57:38,518
Aah!

641
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:42,690
Give it to me.

642
00:57:42,757 --> 00:57:45,860
Aah!

643
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:57,574
Thor!

644
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,575
You're alive!

645
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:00,110
I did it.

646
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:01,545
Don't you ever--

647
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:02,813
I killed him.

648
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:03,881
I killed Loki.

649
00:58:03,948 --> 00:58:05,315
I defeated him.
He's dead.

650
00:58:05,383 --> 00:58:06,684
I saw him melt.

651
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:07,684
And I took this
from him,

652
00:58:07,752 --> 00:58:09,219
and he lost
all of his power.

653
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,854
Ragnerok is over.

654
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,622
You took the devil's tool.

655
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,790
It's cursed.
You must get rid of it.

656
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,525
But I have
his power now.

657
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,627
Even if you do,
Loki's powers are rancid.

658
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,129
They're decayed.

659
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:21,964
Aren't you happy?

660
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:23,465
Loki is gone.

661
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:27,170
His creatures are gone.

662
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,538
It's a trick.

663
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,839
It is not a trick.

664
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,341
Yes, it's a trick.

665
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,377
That is what Loki does.
He tricks.

666
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:36,514
Why is everything I do
on my own wrong? Why?

667
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:38,483
Because you're young.

668
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,552
And you're inexperienced.

669
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:43,755
You have more courage
and more heart than skills.

670
00:58:43,823 --> 00:58:45,290
But one day--

671
00:58:45,357 --> 00:58:46,791
I'm going to bring my brother
and my father back.

672
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:47,825
You'll see.

673
00:58:47,893 --> 00:58:49,760
Those are lies.

674
00:58:49,828 --> 00:58:51,929
We are not mortal.

675
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,563
We are gods,
and they are trapped

676
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,098
in the realm
of Muspellheim.

677
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,033
And there is nothing
you can do about it.

678
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,134
Their fate--

679
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,636
their fate is my fate.

680
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,638
And I have changed
my fate.

681
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,874
Have I not
defeated Loki?

682
00:59:04,942 --> 00:59:07,978
Am I dead as
the Norns had foretold?

683
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,147
Your story is not over,

684
00:59:10,215 --> 00:59:12,482
and when it is, one day
you will discover

685
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,417
that the Norns have sewn
your tales in their tapestries

686
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:15,886
from the beginning.

687
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:19,490
Your father
and brother are gone,

688
00:59:19,558 --> 00:59:22,427
and you cannot change fate.

689
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:28,666
Where are we going?

690
00:59:28,734 --> 00:59:30,335
To my dwelling,

691
00:59:30,402 --> 00:59:32,069
where I should have
taken you long ago.

692
00:59:32,137 --> 00:59:34,238
Where you will be protected.

693
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:35,906
We must get rid
of that wretched thing

694
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:38,074
before it drives you to evil.

695
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:50,020
Tree of Life,
mother of life,

696
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,387
guard these doors

697
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:52,956
so that none
may enter uninvited.

698
01:00:01,299 --> 01:00:03,100
Destroy
that abomination.

699
01:00:03,168 --> 01:00:05,102
Use the Hammer.

700
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,604
I will.

701
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:08,739
Don't even look at it.

702
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:11,209
Where are you going?

703
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:15,581
To find some evidence
that Loki's truly dead.

704
01:00:15,648 --> 01:00:17,116
And until I find
that evidence,

705
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:18,284
you must promise me

706
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:19,719
that you will not leave
the protection

707
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,754
of these walls.

708
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,456
I promise.

709
01:00:23,524 --> 01:00:26,359
Swear on your father
that you will not leave.

710
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:29,962
I swear it
by the blood of my father.

711
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,997
You're strong, Thor.

712
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:34,166
You have a lot to learn.

713
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:37,936
Crush that thing
and burn it.

714
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:51,717
Bring my father back to life.

715
01:00:56,456 --> 01:01:00,193
Bring my father Odin
back to life.

716
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:06,265
Father, I will reach into
the halls of my ancestors

717
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,700
and grab you.

718
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,981
Bring Odin back to life.

719
01:01:37,128 --> 01:01:39,330
Loki!

720
01:01:39,397 --> 01:01:40,998
How did you get past
the rune stone?

721
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:43,233
You invited me.

722
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:45,068
I killed you.

723
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:46,336
You're dead.

724
01:01:46,404 --> 01:01:47,704
Dead?

725
01:01:47,771 --> 01:01:50,339
I never was alive.

726
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,308
Join me,

727
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:54,343
and I'll let
your family live.

728
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,978
My family?

729
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,646
You mean my family,
my father,

730
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,214
who burns
to Muspellheim?

731
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,483
And your brother.

732
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,451
Give me the hammer

733
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,552
and I'll let them
all out.

734
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,653
Liar!

735
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,194
Come on! Come on!

736
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,970
I will not rest
until I have it!

737
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:39,590
Forgive me.

738
01:02:39,658 --> 01:02:42,760
Forgive me for
sneaking away earlier.

739
01:02:42,827 --> 01:02:48,332
Are you ready, Thor,
to actually take my advice?

740
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,401
Yes, I will take it.

741
01:02:50,469 --> 01:02:51,736
I will listen
to what you say.

742
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:53,605
For my father,
who burns in hell.

743
01:02:53,672 --> 01:02:55,740
Good. Then hear me.

744
01:02:55,808 --> 01:02:57,776
We'll return to Valhalla
immediately.

745
01:02:57,844 --> 01:03:02,548
Let Loki smash away all
the people and the buildings.

746
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:04,484
And keep that Hammer
away from Loki

747
01:03:04,552 --> 01:03:05,652
and I promise you,

748
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:06,753
one day you will return

749
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:09,623
to watch him
perish in the dirt.

750
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:37,058
Come, my friends.

751
01:04:15,363 --> 01:04:17,598
How are you, my pet?

752
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:19,666
[Growling]

753
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:22,036
They are near.

754
01:04:22,103 --> 01:04:23,837
They can't escape fate.

755
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:29,743
We can make
a gateway here.

756
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,811
I'm going to need you
to help me summon it.

757
01:04:31,879 --> 01:04:35,114
But Asgard is a heap
of sand and ash.

758
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:36,616
It has been
destroyed.

759
01:04:36,683 --> 01:04:38,184
We'll find a place.

760
01:04:38,252 --> 01:04:39,986
I'll hide you
and the Hammer.

761
01:04:40,053 --> 01:04:41,788
I'm not going.

762
01:04:41,856 --> 01:04:45,259
I'm staying here
to save the Earth.

763
01:04:47,495 --> 01:04:48,829
Thor!

764
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:53,368
Thor, please.
We don't have much time.

765
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,871
I beg you! We must keep
the Hammer away from Loki.

766
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:57,639
It's the only weapon that can
kill the Tree of Life.

767
01:04:57,707 --> 01:04:59,208
So long the tree lives,

768
01:04:59,276 --> 01:05:01,577
there is still a chance
to rebuild.

769
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:04,313
Please!

770
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:05,581
All right.

771
01:05:05,649 --> 01:05:06,816
Good.

772
01:05:06,883 --> 01:05:10,553
Now, hold the Hammer
tight before you.

773
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:12,722
Channel its powers.

774
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:18,093
The will in your heart
will make it open.

775
01:05:29,437 --> 01:05:31,005
Now, you go
through it first.

776
01:05:31,072 --> 01:05:34,341
Jarnsaxa,

777
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:37,110
do you feel
I have the power in me

778
01:05:37,177 --> 01:05:40,412
to carry this through
to the very end,

779
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,280
even if it means
I must fight?

780
01:05:42,348 --> 01:05:44,816
Oh, Thor,

781
01:05:44,884 --> 01:05:47,686
you are a God
beyond my understanding,

782
01:05:47,754 --> 01:05:50,856
the son of the master
who I've served.

783
01:05:50,923 --> 01:05:53,526
If you believe in your heart
that you must fight,

784
01:05:53,594 --> 01:05:57,630
I will live or die
by your side.

785
01:05:57,698 --> 01:05:59,398
I am your soldier.

786
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:05,438
Then go through,
and take this.

787
01:06:05,506 --> 01:06:06,939
Hide it.

788
01:06:07,007 --> 01:06:09,842
Protect it.
Keep it safe from Loki.

789
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,844
I am not leaving
this Earth

790
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:14,480
until I have saved it
or death takes me.

791
01:06:14,548 --> 01:06:15,714
Thor?
No!

792
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,054
Take it! Hurry!
Before it's too late.

793
01:06:22,122 --> 01:06:24,056
No! I'm not
leaving without you.

794
01:06:24,124 --> 01:06:25,291
No!

795
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:27,026
You shall die witch!

796
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:33,299
Lindworms!

797
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:36,969
Lindworms from underneath.

798
01:06:37,037 --> 01:06:38,838
Come to me!

799
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:56,858
Go through the gateway!

800
01:06:56,926 --> 01:06:58,393
I will stop them! Go!

801
01:07:07,003 --> 01:07:10,573
You can't
fight me, Thor.

802
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:13,309
Fate is on my side.

803
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:15,244
Every fabric
of the universe

804
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:16,979
is against you.

805
01:07:17,046 --> 01:07:20,115
Damn the fabric
of the universe.

806
01:07:20,183 --> 01:07:23,351
[Laughs]

807
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,319
[Thunder]

808
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:42,004
[Speaking foreign language]

809
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:20,077
Loki!

810
01:08:47,305 --> 01:08:48,939
It's mine!

811
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:50,207
It's mine!

812
01:08:56,013 --> 01:08:57,447
Come on! Come on!

813
01:08:57,515 --> 01:08:58,715
Let's go!

814
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:14,195
No, Jarnsaxa.

815
01:09:14,263 --> 01:09:15,630
I stay here.

816
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:16,998
To my dwelling then.

817
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:19,267
The rune stone
will protect us.

818
01:09:19,335 --> 01:09:20,702
No.

819
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:24,138
The gateway!

820
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:25,840
The gateway
to my dwelling!

821
01:09:27,777 --> 01:09:29,311
Gateway!

822
01:09:36,454 --> 01:09:37,654
No!

823
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:52,869
Jarnsaxa!

824
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:57,673
Now, let's see.

825
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:02,077
What am I going to do
to you now?

826
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:33,311
Jarnsaxa.

827
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:44,722
No, Jarnsaxa.

828
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:49,695
Jarnsaxa, I'm here.

829
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:52,697
I'm here.
You'll be all right.

830
01:10:52,765 --> 01:10:55,901
I thought
you'd never come.

831
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:59,338
We've got to get you
out of here.

832
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:01,407
We'll get the potion
of healing.

833
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,741
We'll take care of you.

834
01:11:05,645 --> 01:11:07,212
Leave me here.

835
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,581
No, I'll never leave you.

836
01:11:13,285 --> 01:11:16,521
I love you so much.

837
01:11:16,589 --> 01:11:18,456
I love you, too.

838
01:11:25,664 --> 01:11:27,231
Jarnsaxa?

839
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:39,609
Very touching.

840
01:11:49,153 --> 01:11:51,987
[Sirens]

841
01:12:17,814 --> 01:12:19,315
Jarnsaxa...

842
01:12:26,123 --> 01:12:29,325
I could not change
our fate.

843
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:33,596
I'm sorry.

844
01:12:42,138 --> 01:12:45,039
Odin...

845
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:47,041
Forgive me.

846
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:50,611
You are not
defeated yet...

847
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:52,146
My King.

848
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,386
Yes, you are my
King...

849
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:04,458
Ruler of Asgard

850
01:13:04,526 --> 01:13:08,463
who sits atop
the universe...

851
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:10,732
Guardian
of all realms.

852
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:17,974
We're in good hands...

853
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:20,176
Your hands...

854
01:13:20,244 --> 01:13:24,380
For you are not
defeated yet.

855
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:27,483
Thor!

856
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:31,254
I want you to witness
the final moments of Midgard,

857
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:32,822
when this entire planet

858
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:35,424
becomes the gates
to my new kingdom.

859
01:13:35,492 --> 01:13:36,992
It is the end of life,

860
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,760
the end of time,

861
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:40,695
and the end of you.

862
01:13:40,763 --> 01:13:43,231
Not quite.

863
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:48,169
You cling to old dreams.

864
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:49,771
You are an embarrassment.

865
01:13:53,143 --> 01:13:55,678
I want you to taste
the bitterness

866
01:13:55,746 --> 01:13:57,714
of my rise to power,

867
01:13:57,782 --> 01:14:01,618
go back to your worms
and your dogs

868
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:05,356
and leave the true gods
of the nine realms in peace.

869
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:13,529
Soon the nine realms
will no longer exist,

870
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:16,332
and the time of Aesir
is finished,

871
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,234
and I will be ruler
of the next kingdom,

872
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:20,035
not Thor.

873
01:14:20,103 --> 01:14:22,971
Behold, the fire
of Muspellheim.

874
01:14:29,611 --> 01:14:32,680
In it's fiery depths,
your father waits for you...

875
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:36,783
as well as others.

876
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,225
No!

877
01:14:45,293 --> 01:14:47,694
No!

878
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,435
And now I'm off
to kill the Tree of Life...

879
01:14:57,671 --> 01:15:00,373
And unleash the final stages
of Ragnerok.

880
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:07,513
Aah!

881
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:11,317
Close.

882
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,618
It's time.

883
01:15:18,938 --> 01:15:21,172
Father?

884
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,875
Where are you?

885
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:25,543
Jarnsaxa?

886
01:15:25,611 --> 01:15:28,546
Where are you?

887
01:15:28,614 --> 01:15:30,714
I am gone...

888
01:15:30,782 --> 01:15:32,650
And you are ready.

889
01:15:46,632 --> 01:15:50,001
Nothing is beyond you.

890
01:15:50,069 --> 01:15:53,805
Nothing is beyond you.

891
01:15:53,873 --> 01:15:56,274
Nothing is beyond you.

892
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:24,803
I will forge
my own Hammer.

893
01:18:35,941 --> 01:18:38,576
Die, mother
of living earth.

894
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:42,647
Die.

895
01:19:21,589 --> 01:19:23,890
I will not be stopped!

896
01:20:17,514 --> 01:20:18,949
News reporter:
We're getting reports

897
01:20:19,017 --> 01:20:21,351
of scores
of unknown creatures

898
01:20:21,419 --> 01:20:24,155
destroying urban areas
in Southern California.

899
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:26,524
The U.S. military
is doing their best

900
01:20:26,592 --> 01:20:28,459
to respond to the threat.

901
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:36,567
Ragnerok.

902
01:21:04,064 --> 01:21:05,864
Ragnerok!

903
01:21:18,577 --> 01:21:20,044
Ragnerok!

904
01:21:22,948 --> 01:21:24,415
Ragnerok!

905
01:21:59,055 --> 01:22:00,389
Impossible.

906
01:22:17,506 --> 01:22:19,940
I sent you to hell!

907
01:24:13,523 --> 01:24:16,458
The power of that Hammer
belongs to me.

908
01:24:16,526 --> 01:24:18,693
There is nothing left
to fight for.

909
01:24:18,761 --> 01:24:21,329
It's over.

910
01:24:21,397 --> 01:24:23,831
Nothing is over.

911
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:26,600
We control our own fate.

912
01:26:00,094 --> 01:26:03,396
Your heart shall beat
as long as I live.

913
01:26:20,817 --> 01:26:23,519
How dare you come here,
son of Odin.

914
01:26:23,587 --> 01:26:25,421
You are an abomination.

915
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:31,161
Loki was meant to rule

916
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:32,629
the next chapter
of the universe

917
01:26:32,697 --> 01:26:33,563
when this one
is no more.

918
01:26:33,631 --> 01:26:35,566
But you have killed him.

919
01:26:35,633 --> 01:26:36,633
Dead! Gone!

920
01:26:36,701 --> 01:26:37,968
Against the will
of fate,

921
01:26:38,036 --> 01:26:39,937
so carefully woven
in this loom.

922
01:26:40,004 --> 01:26:41,672
We have chaos
in the world.

923
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:43,707
Shameful chaos!

924
01:26:43,775 --> 01:26:45,408
What have you to say
for yourself?

925
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,481
[Screaming]

926
01:27:26,447 --> 01:27:30,618
This world is now controlled
by those who live here,

927
01:27:30,685 --> 01:27:32,086
and it will be,
for good or ill,

928
01:27:32,154 --> 01:27:34,455
what we ourselves
make of it.

929
01:27:34,523 --> 01:27:37,526
That is true fate.
