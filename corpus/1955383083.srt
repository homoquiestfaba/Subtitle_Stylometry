I like 'em a whole lot more when
they're not pointed right at me.

more than guns, Milton?

368

It's bullets.

Do you know why?

371
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:50,141
Probably because they
fit so well into the guns.

372
00:24:56,546 --> 00:24:59,383

always like to keep one chamber empty.

or how far we'd go...

went or what we did...

701
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:33,366
...none of it seemed to matter.

702
00:52:33,368 --> 00:52:37,339
Cause when morning
came... and it always came.

703
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:42,611
We find ourselves... right back here.

704
00:52:43,478 --> 00:52:47,649
Every... single... morning.

705
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:03,797

of time labyrinth... a maze.

706
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:07,201
Well if this is a maze
there's gotta be a way out.

707

There also has to be a way in.

709
00:53:11,674 --> 00:53:14,208
and started this whole
thing in the first place.

710
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,877
Something or someone.

713
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:21,848
The night before all this
started, in the woods,

714
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,984
he told me he came from a long
line of powerful medicine men.

715
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:28,455
Trust me, Milton, Russell isn't
capable of any supernatural voodoo.

716
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:30,826
- He didn't cause this to happen.
- Maybe not...

00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,697
But maybe...

718
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:40,836
Maybe he knows what did.

719

720
00:53:53,015 --> 00:53:54,748

726

You'd have been proud of this one, Russell.

735
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:47,035
You really, really would have been proud.

736

Ok, but I'm guessing you're not exactly
open to the idea of me killing you.

No, I'm not too crazy
about that notion either...

Maybe the answer to this whole thing,

1061

maybe the real way out
is just to never leave.

Why not? Looks warm and cozy enough.

1236
01:39:27,846 --> 01:39:31,548
Seriously, Skyler... what
the fuck happened here?

1237
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:36,654
Well, you know how it is, Archer...
couple of drinks, couple of laughs.

1238
01:39:36,656 --> 01:39:38,923
Couple of million dollars
worth of crystal meth...

1239
01:39:38,925 --> 01:39:41,057
4,248,000 dollars...

1240
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:43,494
Deal I made with Russell.

1241
01:39:43,496 --> 01:39:46,266
Well, what's, uh... left of him.

1242
01:39:47,099 --> 01:39:48,935
We have a new deal for you.

1244

01:40:14,493 --> 01:40:17,360
Uh, Archer, can someone
please explain to the bitch

1251
01:40:17,362 --> 01:40:20,399
that we're all alone in the
middle of the fucking woods...

1252
01:40:23,102 --> 01:40:24,304
Yeah.

1253
01:40:31,376 --> 01:40:35,579
I'd like to say this was
nothing personal, Skyler, but...

1254
01:40:35,581 --> 01:40:37,985
...that wouldn't be telling
the truth, now would it?

1255
01:40:39,318 --> 01:40:40,988
Probably not.

01:40:42,522 --> 01:40:43,390
Well...

1257
01:40:44,657 --> 01:40:47,557
Let's just say I'll see you
in hell and leave it at that.

1258
01:40:47,559 --> 01:40:52,862
Yeah, Archer... maybe
I'll see you in hell...

1259
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,001
Or maybe...

1260
01:40:54,901 --> 01:40:56,836
