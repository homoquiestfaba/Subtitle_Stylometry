1
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,499
Ahh ahh ahh...

2
00:01:05,946 --> 00:01:13,910
Ahhh ahhh ehhhh

3
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:45,450
<i>Adam, do you know what this is?</i>

4
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,946
Adam, do you know what this is?

5
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,216
Ahhh...

6
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,056
Is that an articulate response?

7
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,655
<i>What you make of it.
You're the Professor, Doctor.</i>

8
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:01,166
Adam.

9
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,293
<i>Some might say
you're a problem student.</i>

10
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,897
<i>Some might say you're
a student with problems.</i>

11
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:08,404
Either way I don't like it.

12
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,238
<i>You can't take contradiction?</i>

13
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,039
<i>You know what
that means?</i>

14
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:13,306
Disagreement.

15
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,315
<i>Disagreement without merit.</i>

16
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:19,409
And merit is what
you are severely lacking.

17
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:26,191
I appreciate healthy debate
in the classroom. I always have.

18
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:30,161
<i>But you have to have
a basis, a foundation a belief.</i>

19
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,293
Or else there is not debate.
Whatever meaning you intend is void.

20
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:39,304
<i>It makes you and your ideas all
of nothing. Nothing... nothing</i>

21
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:42,599
<i>When you are nothing,
Adam, you must learn.</i>

22
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,509
Adam, are you listening?

23
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,274
<i>You have a headache?</i>

24
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:48,609
I wonder why.

25
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:54,518
<i>Adam. You are bright clearly.
But when it comes to work</i>

26
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:57,853
when it comes to answering
a simple essay question...

27
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:01,189
<i>a primer for the final,
no less, and you are asked</i>

28
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:04,321
"What have I learned in this class?"
And you come up with this.

29
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:09,202
You know what I do
with people like you?

30
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:20,211
<i>All grades aside, whatever you
choose to do with your life and career</i>

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,215
medical ethics will
continue to exist without you.

32
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:27,985
<i>But without medical ethics,
you and your career are nothing.</i>

33
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,489
You need this course,
not the other way around.

34
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:37,285
Okay.

35
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:39,832
You may go.

36
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:16,400
<i>Hello.</i>

37
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:17,936
<i>Adam?</i>

38
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,266
Adam Smith?

39
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,096
Yeah?

40
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,141
Check your email.

41
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:32,807
Click

42
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,205
<i>Hello Adam, I've enjoyed
our correspondence</i>

43
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:57,107
<i>But I believe we should now
end this one-sided anonymity.</i>

44
00:04:57,177 --> 00:05:00,635
<i>If you'd like to exchange those
burdensome studies for some true</i>

45
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:05,811
<i>practical expertise,
I am ready to meet with you.</i>

46
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,348
<i>For I am in need of an assistant,
and you may be the perfect candidate.</i>

47
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:15,190
<i>Your writings have demonstrated
your high trust of science.</i>

48
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:20,164
<i>Which is matched only by your distrust
of the community that practices it.</i>

49
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,236
<i>I cherish and share these
qualities and remain committed</i>

50
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,602
<i>to more elevated endeavors.</i>

51
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,207
<i>I'll reserve discussion
of my work until we meet</i>

52
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:34,440
<i>but please know that
we have the opportunity</i>

53
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:39,542
<i>and the obligation to change
science, if not life itself.</i>

54
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,312
<i>That may sound eccentric,
and you don't know me.</i>

55
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,692
<i>I do not ask that you believe me.
Only that you meet with me.</i>

56
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:54,758
<i>To do so, please be at Willow Junction
at 8:00 AM. You will be met.</i>

57
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:38,833
You're Adam?

58
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,878
I'm Kate. Sorry I'm late.

59
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,340
You coming?

60
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:51,221
Are you, are you the guy
that emailed me?

61
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,383
The guy?

62
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:53,448
No.

63
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,521
Emailed? No.

64
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,457
I'm the girl
picking you up.

65
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:00,693
So get in.

66
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:03,834
Now is good.

67
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,643
Hi.

68
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:14,736
Uhhh.

69
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,274
<i>I hope you didn't
wait too long.</i>

70
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:25,220
You feeling alright?

71
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,120
Yeah, yeah.
I'm feeling alright.

72
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:33,632
<i>I'm just... you know,
I'm feeling a lot of things.</i>

73
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,100
It's these headaches I get.
Is not big deal.

74
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,367
You know there's
a cure for that.

75
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,034
It's called aspirin.

76
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:45,604
Wow. The only woman around
for miles gives me shit.

77
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:48,112
<i>My aunt gets
migraines all the time.</i>

78
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,912
<i>Yeah. Usually,
of course when I'm around.</i>

79
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:56,115
<i>I show up, start talking. Next thing
you know she has to go lie down</i>

80
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:59,852
<i>and stay in bed for a week.
She sees these bright lights</i>

81
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,985
and it's like a knife
through her head.

82
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:04,921
Maybe it's me.

83
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:10,669
<i>No. People get migraines,
they don't give them.</i>

84
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:13,205
I don't know.
I think I gave you one.

85
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:17,937
I was born with one.
It's sort of dysfunction.

86
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,912
I think I'm allergic to people.

87
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:23,910
They kind make you sneeze?

88
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:27,584
No, like they make me nervous.

89
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:29,118
Oh.

90
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,055
Do I make you nervous?

91
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,617
Uh... haaa.

92
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:36,584
Yeah.

93
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:53,544
<i>So, you're here
to see the Doctor.</i>

94
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,305
<i>I guess.</i>

95
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,009
<i>You don't know?</i>

96
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,078
<i>Didn't mention his name.</i>

97
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:06,085
It's not for the headaches.
It's for an interview.

98
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,492
You came all the way out here,
to meet somebody you don't know?

99
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:13,422
It's for a job.
For an interview.

100
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,691
Oh, doing what?

101
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,804
You don't know that either.

102
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,001
Okay, fair enough.

103
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:25,469
Do you know this Doctor?

104
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,567
Dr. Vick?

105
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:30,845
<i>Franklin Vick.
That's his name.</i>

106
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:35,411
He lives up in the hills. All
private. The peaceful life.

107
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:40,386
<i>I don't actually know him but I'm
always delivering things to him.</i>

108
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,920
My folks own the shipping store,
so guess who gets the dirty work?

109
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:47,228
Is he a nice guy?

110
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:52,167
I like to think so.
I've never actually met him.

111
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:54,206
I just do what his emails say.

112
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,866
Sort of like you.

113
00:09:58,945 --> 00:09:59,934
Well.

114
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,469
<i>Here we go.</i>

115
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,313
<i>End of the road.</i>

116
00:10:06,786 --> 00:10:10,586
<i>This is where I drop the stuff off.
He comes down to get it.</i>

117
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,783
Is he coming down
to get me?

118
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,126
No... I don't think so.

119
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:20,290
So what do I do?

120
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,629
<i>It's a bit of a hike,
but you'll be fine.</i>

121
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,737
Just think of it
like his driveway.

122
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,137
A very long driveway
that you can't see

123
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:38,072
<i>surrounded by trees,
wild animals.</i>

124
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,809
<i>And you're alone.</i>

125
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:43,548
There you go.

126
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,091
Oh... directions.

127
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:51,163
So, this is for you.

128
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:55,159
Head up through here.
Follow these ribbons.

129
00:10:57,103 --> 00:11:00,630
<i>And, hey so... nice
meeting you.</i>

130
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:04,743
Oh.

131
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:05,778
Yeah, cold.

132
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:08,445
Good luck.

133
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:10,772
Okay. Thanks.

134
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:13,708
I'll see you.

135
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,548
Kate.

136
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,750
Yeah?

137
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:25,425
You ever make it up there?

138
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:28,801
No. I've got bad knees.

139
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,760
Okay.

140
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,368
But you stay in town, right?

141
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:41,436
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,306
<i>Okay.</i>

143
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,248
<i>You ever want to go out?</i>

144
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:50,849
Yeah?

145
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,481
Is that a question
or an answer?

146
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,696
I'll give you
my number.

147
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:06,703
So... Call me
when you are free.

148
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:14,810
My fingers are frozen.

149
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:17,338
Good luck.

150
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:20,547
I'll see you.

151
00:13:56,482 --> 00:14:04,617
Ohhh

152
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:36,677
Hello?

153
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,325
Hello?

154
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:56,463
Hello?

155
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,568
Uhh!

156
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:02,403
Glad you made it.

157
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,470
Ohhh! Geez!

158
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:08,109
<i>Hey. I'm Adam. Adam Schmidt.</i>

159
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,820
Some whiskey
if you want it.

160
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:13,051
Isn't it a little early for that?

161
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,990
Depends what time
you wake up, yeah?

162
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:19,231
<i>Sorry I couldn't pick up you.
The snowmobile's broken.</i>

163
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:24,601
Tough journey?

164
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,702
You're sizing me up.

165
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,206
<i>Trying to make
something of me.</i>

166
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,408
"What the hell do I do up here?
Why the hell did he ask me up here?"

167
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,582
<i>So, go ahead, fire away.</i>

168
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,422
You have aspirin?

169
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:49,759
You came all this way
to ask for aspirin?

170
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,132
You couldn't go
to a drugstore?

171
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,565
I get these headaches.

172
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,329
I kinda have a sensitive head.

173
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,031
Thanks.

174
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,479
<i>So, tell me why you came?</i>

175
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,315
You mentioned
some job.

176
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:14,241
<i>Or research.</i>

177
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:15,545
No, no, no, no.

178
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,252
<i>That's no why.</i>

179
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:19,120
No?

180
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:22,854
No. You came because
you couldn't resist.

181
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:26,324
The mystery of it all.

182
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,269
I had to tease your
curiosity. Entice you.

183
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:34,262
See if you could follow
through with it.

184
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,469
Are you satisfied?

185
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:40,676
Don't judge me.

186
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,971
Oh, no, I'm not judging.

187
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:44,972
<i>I'm observing.</i>

188
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:47,781
<i>That's what I do.</i>

189
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,119
I'm not a cage monkey, Dr. Vick.

190
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:57,084
Oh, yes of course,
the delivery guy.

191
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,218
Girl.

192
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:00,154
Really?

193
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,431
Yeah.

194
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,826
Sure you don't want
a drink?

195
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:04,961
I'm not interested.

196
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:07,505
Relax Adam, we're together here.

197
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,568
<i>Adam.</i>

198
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,649
Have you ever heard
of cryonics?

199
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,612
Sure. Ted Williams.
Doesn't work.

200
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,674
<i>Yet.</i>

201
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,317
Doesn't work now
but one day it is...

202
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:28,457
You see, it has
its basis in fact.

203
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,461
Three, actually.

204
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:34,693
One, life can be stopped.
Like a switch.

205
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:38,703
Turned off and on.
Started up all over again.

206
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,500
Frozen adults
have survived.

207
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:45,703
Embryos can be preserved.
For years.

208
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,604
If that basic structure
is kept intact

209
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:51,743
life can be turned back on.

210
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:57,551
Two. The cold keeps
that basic structure intact.

211
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,592
<i>Right down
to the molecular level.</i>

212
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:03,127
<i>You can vitrify an
organ the size of a brain</i>

213
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,958
<i>with cold
and chemicals today.</i>

214
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:09,329
And three, and this is the kicker,
new technologies like

215
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,962
<i>nano-technology, and such</i>

216
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:15,063
<i>will one day heal
what's broken inside of you.</i>

217
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,642
<i>Fix you up on its own</i>

218
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:23,309
from the inside out, right
down to the molecular level.

219
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:26,146
You'll be healthier
than you were before.

220
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:27,412
With nano-technology.

221
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:30,148
And such.

222
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,483
So, you work in cryonics?
Nano-technology?

223
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:36,919
The "such. "

224
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,589
Okay.

225
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:45,597
I'm interested.

226
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:48,805
Okay.

227
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,674
<i>So, you're in?</i>

228
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:11,418
Yeah.

229
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:21,795
Adam.

230
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:02,437
<i>Subject Two. Approximate time
of death 12:30 PM.</i>

231
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:06,975
<i>Initial injection of serum given
approximately three minutes later.</i>

232
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:13,287
<i>Lacerations sutured.
Ambient temperature 27 degrees.</i>

233
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,089
16 PM, no change.

234
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:29,398
<i>Current time, 3:21 PM.
Subject Two. No change in condition.</i>

235
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:32,543
Surfactant booster
given by the hour.

236
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:38,472
No sign of livormortis.
As for rigor.

237
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:43,577
Mmhu.

238
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:39,172
Current time 11:31 AM.
Ambient temperature...

239
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,213
Subject two revived.

240
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,241
Now...

241
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,321
Can you hear me?

242
00:21:58,063 --> 00:22:00,190
Do you remember anything?

243
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:03,000
You...

244
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:06,804
killed me.

245
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,336
Good morning.

246
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:15,168
Welcome.

247
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:20,778
<i>You're cold, aren't you.</i>

248
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,116
We needed that cold.

249
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,752
You're the first, Adam.

250
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:30,759
How about that?

251
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:32,886
Here.

252
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,794
<i>Take this.</i>

253
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,598
It helps restructure your cells.

254
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,036
<i>Take it now.</i>

255
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,563
There you go.

256
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:49,207
Resuscitation successful.

257
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,782
<i>Subject sitting upright.</i>

258
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:53,945
Color returning.

259
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,349
Cerebral functions impaired.

260
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,489
Yet, able to follow
some simple commands.

261
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:06,625
<i>Mental status</i>

262
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:08,955
T. B. D.

263
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:20,610
Lie down, Adam.

264
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:26,341
You need your rest.

265
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,312
I did it, you bastard.

266
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:44,719
<i>Adam, I told you to lie down.</i>

267
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:51,525
<i>That's it.</i>

268
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,037
There you go.

269
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,001
I'm not a baby.

270
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,074
No, I don't think you are.

271
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:13,950
Is One that?

272
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,361
Is one what?

273
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:20,860
Subject One.
You call me Subject Two.

274
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,662
You heard that?

275
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,076
What happened to him?

276
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:39,083
He didn't work out.

277
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:43,419
<i>Head trauma. Stopped the
serum cold. No synapses.</i>

278
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,285
<i>Vzzzzz, useless.</i>

279
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,048
What's..?

280
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:53,126
That? I extracted
what I could.

281
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,194
<i>Decomposing cells
lowered the pH level.</i>

282
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,804
<i>Triggers a chain
reaction in the nanites.</i>

283
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:04,067
Helps the serum propagate,
build upon itself.

284
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:08,511
Becomes more self-sufficient.
That's what's happening to you.

285
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:11,105
That's what's keeping you alive.

286
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:12,980
I owe life to him?

287
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,075
<i>No.</i>

288
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,656
You owe your life to me. Him...

289
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:21,818
<i>we don't need.
We've got you now.</i>

290
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:25,855
Someone call you should.

291
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,689
<i>Like who? The police?</i>

292
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,692
Relative? Just right.

293
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,638
You know his family? Do
you know who we should call?

294
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:41,074
<i>Your sentence structure will
improve. So will everything else.</i>

295
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,874
<i>Soon you'll be firing
on all cylinders.</i>

296
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:46,775
<i>Doc.</i>

297
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:47,841
I feel odd.

298
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:49,949
How so?

299
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:53,048
I feel things, I...

300
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:59,921
<i>Not like before.
I feel the feel of black.</i>

301
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:07,097
My thoughts,
they misconnect.

302
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,932
I don't straight think.

303
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,438
There are sensations
you know should.

304
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:15,605
Tell me about them.

305
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,679
There is this weightlessness.

306
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:22,281
<i>Freedom.</i>

307
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:24,717
<i>A single sound.</i>

308
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:32,894
<i>When everything stops inside you,
one single sound is all there still is.</i>

309
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,092
I heard the echo
of my last heartbeat.

310
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:40,965
It's beautiful.

311
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,041
<i>It lingers.</i>

312
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:52,247
My headaches...

313
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:55,176
they're gone.

314
00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:59,949
Your work must continue.
It's important.

315
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:02,450
I want to be part of it.

316
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:15,669
<i>Are you okay, Adam?</i>

317
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:18,201
How are you feeling?

318
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:30,977
Ready.

319
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:09,691
Aggghhh agggghhh

320
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:12,612
You're up.

321
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,086
What time did you wake?

322
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:17,016
Now.

323
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:19,664
How long?

324
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:20,720
Five days.

325
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,824
<i>I kept you under to make sure
you're healing okay.</i>

326
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:25,425
You okay?

327
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:27,994
<i>Good.</i>

328
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,468
Clothes fit you nicely.

329
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,769
Subject-Two resuscitation
time 1:21 PM.

330
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,871
Don't call me that.

331
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,176
I have a name.

332
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:42,351
Documentation's objective, Adam.
It has to be. It maintains the distance.

333
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,183
<i>You can't let feelings take over.</i>

334
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:59,336
Go lie down on your back.

335
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:20,222
Subject Two. Faculties stronger.
Cognitives skills improved.

336
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:26,162
<i>Neck wound
healing nicely... and rapidly.</i>

337
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:32,469
<i>Abdomen wounds...
no discoloration.</i>

338
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:36,674
<i>No bleeding...</i>

339
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:41,736
no swelling.

340
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,207
<i>How are you feeling, Adam?</i>

341
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:53,190
No, no. Lie back down.

342
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,091
Doc?

343
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,236
The sound is gone.

344
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,976
It's very warm inside of me.

345
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:21,975
Let's get you going.

346
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,577
Doc?

347
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:27,480
Come here.

348
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:30,283
Yeah?

349
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:40,564
You have no idea what's
going on inside of me right now.

350
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:42,895
No.

351
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:44,968
No I don't.

352
00:32:54,953 --> 00:32:56,580
And apparently neither do you.

353
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:03,556
What's going on inside of you?
I can stop all of it.

354
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:12,669
Let's get you up, get some
new clothes, and go for a hike.

355
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:15,704
Get your strength back.

356
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:50,972
Oh God! My muscles
are so damn weak.

357
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:53,203
It's just the serum.

358
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,679
You'll get used to it.
We gotta keep going.

359
00:33:57,882 --> 00:33:58,871
Fuck.

360
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:02,942
Ouh!...

361
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:07,949
You all right?

362
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:14,298
Pins and needles.

363
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,561
It's going away.

364
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:31,207
Subject Two, experiencing
easy fatigability.

365
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:37,346
Question: Neurogenic etiology
versus vascular insufficiency.

366
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:40,653
Is it in the nerves
or in the blood?

367
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:54,571
Ehemm...

368
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,942
Ahhh...

369
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,513
I ain't picking you up.

370
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,177
Just taking a little breather.

371
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,122
We gotta go,
it's getting late.

372
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:20,664
Hey!

373
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:36,407
Ohhh... Ahhh

374
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:01,333
It's all so
out of touch up here.

375
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:07,635
Ever make it to town?

376
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,875
Ever get lonely up here?

377
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,944
As lonely as I need to be.

378
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:19,421
You know that
delivery girl? Kate?

379
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,784
I think she likes you.

380
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:27,255
She never met me.

381
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,523
She still likes you.

382
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,232
Likes the idea of you.

383
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:36,297
Hell, I like the idea of me.

384
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,834
I like the idea of her.

385
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:45,815
Adam, is there something
that we need to discuss?

386
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:50,877
No, I won't go see her.

387
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:54,414
I'm contagious, aren't I.

388
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:57,988
Why do you say that?

389
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:00,760
I see the way
you handle me.

390
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:03,029
The gloves, the distance.

391
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,195
That's why I can
never see her again.

392
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:10,773
Or anyone.

393
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,508
Maybe that's
the way it goes.

394
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:20,976
Live and die
all by yourself.

395
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:23,547
No people.

396
00:37:26,324 --> 00:37:28,292
We're up here together,
you and me.

397
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,863
<i>In this little box. Above the
clouds. Overlooking the world.</i>

398
00:37:36,067 --> 00:37:38,331
<i>Imagine when we come
down from the mountain.</i>

399
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,229
<i>With this gift of fire?</i>

400
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:46,775
They'll never understand.

401
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:48,606
One day they will.

402
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:51,671
Yeah.

403
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,214
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

404
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:57,276
<i>Tired.</i>

405
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,278
Good.

406
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:01,757
Hands hurt.

407
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,060
Not your wrists?

408
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:09,029
No, no. Feet, feet hurt.

409
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:12,599
Tingling. A little burning.

410
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:14,760
<i>Doc?</i>

411
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:17,535
Why did you choose me?

412
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:21,278
We could've chosen
anybody.

413
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:23,309
<i>Preferably
a medical student.</i>

414
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,977
Young. Smart.
But naive.

415
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:30,217
<i>Strong minded
and curious.</i>

416
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:35,525
But the truth...
Truth.

417
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:43,065
Truthfully... I saw a lot
of me in your writings.

418
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:49,039
And I knew that
no one would miss you.

419
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:56,973
You said "we".

420
00:38:58,116 --> 00:38:59,105
Mmm?

421
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,376
Who's "we"?

422
00:39:13,965 --> 00:39:18,561
<i>Subject Two.
Time of death, 9: 16 PM.</i>

423
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:35,474
Same trail?

424
00:39:39,257 --> 00:39:40,246
Yeah.

425
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,559
Hey, Doc.

426
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,403
What are you shooting
me up with? Steroids?

427
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:05,236
<i>Aahhhhhhhhh! hahooo!</i>

428
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:13,681
<i>Aahhhhhhhhh! hahooo!</i>

429
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,844
ahhhhhhhh

430
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:29,162
I can't take it.

431
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,465
It's so much, all of it.

432
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:43,738
<i>Everywhere,
it's... everything.</i>

433
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:45,004
<i>Yeah.</i>

434
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,718
Mountains will do that to you.

435
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,745
It's not just that.

436
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:52,879
It's that... It's...

437
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:56,360
a thousand new feelings every second.

438
00:41:57,695 --> 00:41:58,684
<i>A million.</i>

439
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,628
<i>It's endless.
There's no end to it.</i>

440
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,432
<i>Look at that sky.</i>

441
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,301
<i>Those trees.</i>

442
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:19,306
You can lose yourself
in those hills.

443
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:31,853
Ahhhh... ohhhh

444
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:35,122
<i>Ahhhhh!</i>

445
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,223
Adam.

446
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,794
<i>Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!</i>

447
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:41,804
Are you in pain?

448
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,306
No, don't touch me.

449
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:50,473
Ahhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhh!

450
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:54,279
Ahh! Ahh! Aaaah!

451
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:59,517
Ahhh!

452
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:07,394
Ahhhh!

453
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:13,397
Ahhh!

454
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,974
Ahh! Doc, kill me!

455
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:20,738
Adam, I can contain it.

456
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:23,211
Aaaaaaah!

457
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,270
No!

458
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:37,424
Please Doc. Please.
Just put...

459
00:43:43,334 --> 00:43:44,323
put...

460
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:44,647
<i>You're okay. You're here.</i>

461
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:48,914
Hold on.

462
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:53,289
Grhh... aghhh

463
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:02,802
You're fine.

464
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:04,998
What happened?

465
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:10,309
I kept you under for six days.
Sampled some spinal fluid.

466
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:12,906
<i>Gave you some
seizure medication.</i>

467
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:15,474
Increased your gabapentin
for your nerves.

468
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,646
No, I mean,
what happened?

469
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:19,113
You tell me.

470
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:24,827
It was like a nuclear
bomb inside. Every inch...

471
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:28,331
every thing
was hurting like crazy.

472
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:31,994
You had a reaction
to the serum.

473
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,299
<i>Your normal
synaptic reactions</i>

474
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:38,275
seem to be amplified.

475
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:41,505
You feel too much.

476
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:45,179
I've made
adjustments.

477
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:46,876
<i>It shouldn't
happen again.</i>

478
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:49,545
Get some sleep.

479
00:46:58,062 --> 00:47:01,498
<i>Subject Two.
Concern over condition</i>

480
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,731
<i>growing.</i>

481
00:47:05,436 --> 00:47:08,633
<i>Nanites promoting
generation.</i>

482
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,029
<i>Wounds healing.</i>

483
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,541
But synaptic activity

484
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:22,313
continues to increase.

485
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:26,181
<i>Gabapentin has proven
to be ineffectual.</i>

486
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:30,384
<i>Same as the seizure
medication and sedatives.</i>

487
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:35,263
<i>Intensity of attacks increasing.</i>

488
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:38,061
<i>Duration unpredictable.</i>

489
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:40,604
<i>Solution...</i>

490
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:42,998
Help me!

491
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:48,267
<i>Please!</i>

492
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,377
<i>Doc!</i>

493
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:51,641
No!

494
00:47:53,150 --> 00:48:11,297
<i>Aaaahhh!</i>

495
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:55,798
My chest hurts.

496
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:58,864
This is for you.

497
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,047
I solved it, Adam.

498
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,044
<i>You won't have those
reaction anymore.</i>

499
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:12,846
What did you do?

500
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:20,091
Did you sleep well? Restless?

501
00:50:26,737 --> 00:50:30,070
Sorry about shooting you.
It wasn't very scientific.

502
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:38,344
Drink all of it.

503
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:45,482
There you go.

504
00:50:50,194 --> 00:50:52,162
<i>That should tide
you over till dinner.</i>

505
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,754
We are having leftovers.

506
00:51:00,871 --> 00:51:01,769
Hey, Doc.

507
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:05,130
Thank you.

508
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:10,812
Thank you for
helping me. And...

509
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:13,271
including me.

510
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:15,412
<i>You're a genius.</i>

511
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:22,050
Inaccurate and unnecessary.
Thanks though.

512
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:26,529
<i>Adam...</i>

513
00:51:28,198 --> 00:51:29,961
Someday you're
gonna leave here.

514
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:34,570
<i>And you won't need
the formula any more.</i>

515
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:38,406
You'll outlive me
and everything else.

516
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:43,644
But I have to outlive you first.

517
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:47,739
Rest up.

518
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:15,837
Do you like your food?

519
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:20,710
Are you eating any of it?

520
00:52:23,821 --> 00:52:25,254
<i>I'm not a very good chef.</i>

521
00:52:27,825 --> 00:52:29,053
But you should taste it.

522
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:34,562
Why are my arms wrapped?

523
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,528
I had to do some tests.

524
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:40,031
But why are they bandaged?

525
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,746
I don't feel anything
in my hands, Doc.

526
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:58,447
It's the local.

527
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:03,351
Why would you give
me a local if I was dead?

528
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:07,254
How are you feeling
right now, Adam?

529
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:11,963
I'm feeling pretty good. Except for
the fact that I can't feel my hands.

530
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:13,093
Taste your food.

531
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:18,334
I'm not a very good chef but

532
00:53:18,408 --> 00:53:20,273
you should taste it.

533
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:22,108
I'm not hungry.

534
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,473
Please, taste your food.

535
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:30,742
<i>You see. Your pains
and reactions</i>

536
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:32,755
they are...

537
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:35,683
Lewis and Clark,
they didn't have a map.

538
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:38,852
<i>They made one as they went along.
And that's what we're doing.</i>

539
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:41,592
We're making one
as we go along.

540
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:45,828
What did you do to me?

541
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:48,731
The best I could.

542
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,937
<i>That's what I do.
That's what I did.</i>

543
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:53,902
That's what I had to.

544
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:58,241
You're gonna be fine.

545
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:03,117
You will be fine.

546
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:07,646
<i>I'm dying ain't I?
I'm really dying.</i>

547
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:09,781
No.

548
00:54:12,496 --> 00:54:13,485
No.

549
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:19,193
How are you feeling right now?

550
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:25,697
<i>Adam.</i>

551
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:35,283
Ahh!

552
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,016
I feel cold.

553
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:52,917
Good.

554
00:55:54,865 --> 00:55:57,732
I want you to remember
this feeling.

555
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:00,228
I want you to feel.

556
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:04,299
I'm not going to, will I.

557
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:06,072
<i>Your pain</i>

558
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:09,606
<i>your synapses</i>

559
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:16,719
<i>I couldn't control it.</i>

560
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:20,589
I couldn't stop it.

561
00:56:40,143 --> 00:56:41,610
I'm not cold now.

562
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:43,668
No.

563
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:51,243
<i>You won't feel
anymore pain.</i>

564
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:56,924
Please, dream
about being cold.

565
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:37,422
Doc.

566
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,068
I'm out for my hike.

567
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:40,245
Click

568
01:00:11,655 --> 01:00:14,089
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

569
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:15,813
Hey.

570
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:20,696
I'm so fucking sorry, man!

571
01:00:21,932 --> 01:00:25,265
Don't you wear a fucking vest,
asshole? Shit!

572
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:26,900
What's your name?

573
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:27,937
What?

574
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:29,093
I'm Adam.

575
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:30,361
Nice to meet you.

576
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:35,945
It's okay.

577
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:38,980
I'll get you help.
Take it easy.

578
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:41,507
<i>And don't fucking
die on me out here.</i>

579
01:00:41,785 --> 01:00:43,616
Don't die out here! Jesus!

580
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:44,676
I'm not hurt.

581
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:56,788
It's shock.

582
01:01:13,216 --> 01:01:14,183
Jesus!

583
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:26,617
Fuck!

584
01:01:26,863 --> 01:01:29,855
Hey. Where did you go?

585
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:34,199
I'll get you help, man.

586
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,898
<i>There's a cabin I passed
back there. Take it easy.</i>

587
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:38,268
<i>Geez!</i>

588
01:02:01,364 --> 01:02:04,356
<i>Help! Somebody!</i>

589
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:07,597
<i>Help! Somebody help!</i>

590
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,864
Oh. Fuck!

591
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:12,298
<i>Help!... Help!</i>

592
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:21,046
I think I killed a guy.
I think he's dead.

593
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:22,407
Great.

594
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:25,453
I got a wife.

595
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:32,750
Adam, what were you doing?

596
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:39,833
<i>He's dead, isn't he?</i>

597
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:48,175
No. He's fine.

598
01:02:48,678 --> 01:02:51,545
Dude, I shot him in the chest.
I nailed the guy.

599
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:54,583
<i>No, no, no, no.
He's lost a lot of blood.</i>

600
01:02:54,651 --> 01:02:55,913
It looks worse than it is.

601
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:57,545
<i>I gave him a shot.</i>

602
01:02:58,588 --> 01:02:59,282
I'm a doctor.

603
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:00,617
He's fine.

604
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:02,214
Look at him.

605
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:05,950
Hey, tell me what happened.

606
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:11,925
I was out.
I was just hunting.

607
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:12,990
Illegally.

608
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,263
And...

609
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:21,710
<i>he just came along.</i>

610
01:03:29,185 --> 01:03:30,447
Oh, shit!

611
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:46,459
I'm gonna lay down.

612
01:03:54,144 --> 01:03:56,874
You see? I told you it
looked worse than it was.

613
01:03:58,114 --> 01:04:01,811
But his eyes.
They're so white.

614
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:04,246
Look. You had a scare.

615
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:08,420
Your imagination can run
wild. Especially up here.

616
01:04:08,925 --> 01:04:12,292
These mountains can
make a man a little mad.

617
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:15,829
I'm not making this up.

618
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:20,131
No, I'm not saying you are.
But as you can see, he's fine.

619
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,732
Hey, would you like
to have a drink?

620
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,869
No.

621
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:33,704
Are you sure?

622
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:34,772
No.

623
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:38,276
I gotta go.

624
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:50,197
Are you really
a doctor?

625
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:53,457
He's in good hands.

626
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:32,436
You took care of him?

627
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:34,200
<i>He won't bother us.</i>

628
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:42,406
Adam.

629
01:05:42,986 --> 01:05:45,921
What were you thinking,
going where the population goes?

630
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:48,647
It threatens
everything that we do.

631
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:50,457
<i>It wasn't the population.</i>

632
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:52,117
It was one person.

633
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:56,794
I had no idea.
I didn't even see him.

634
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:58,060
Do you want to be found?

635
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,667
He already knew about you.

636
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,399
<i>He knew about this place.</i>

637
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:05,836
Other people know who you are
whether you like it or not.

638
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:07,603
Nobody knows anything
about me.

639
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:21,355
How did it feel, by the way?

640
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:27,485
It didn't.

641
01:06:29,232 --> 01:06:30,221
<i>It doesn't.</i>

642
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:35,369
It's like...

643
01:06:36,939 --> 01:06:37,871
death.

644
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,364
Yeah.

645
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:48,541
He's headed out now.

646
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:51,146
What do you mean?

647
01:06:51,287 --> 01:06:52,379
He's gone. He's left.

648
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:54,345
You let him, go?

649
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:55,356
Yeah.

650
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:58,427
He threatens everything.
You said it.

651
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:01,554
He was scared shitless, Adam.

652
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:04,463
<i>He didn't know
what the fuck he saw.</i>

653
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:06,468
No one would believe
him. We're fine.

654
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:07,525
He's infected.

655
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:11,272
He touched me. He was all over
me when he put me in that sled.

656
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:13,002
What if he hooks up
with someone?

657
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:15,374
<i>The serum doesn't last,
it's not communicable.</i>

658
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:16,707
Then I'm not contagious?

659
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,140
What the fuck, Doc?

660
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:26,644
You don't know.

661
01:07:30,493 --> 01:07:31,482
The gun.

662
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:32,550
What are you doing?

663
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:36,560
He dropped his rifle in the snow.

664
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:37,993
<i>He's going back for it.</i>

665
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:39,295
You're going after him?

666
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:41,435
You coming?

667
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:15,061
Adam!

668
01:08:15,138 --> 01:08:16,366
Shhhhhh!

669
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:17,406
Don't be stupid.

670
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:54,932
<i>Adam!</i>

671
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,039
<i>Wait!</i>

672
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:10,552
<i>Adam. We don't
even know this man.</i>

673
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,623
What do you
expect me to do?

674
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:15,356
Someone is waiting at the
bottom of the hill for him.

675
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:16,830
He is going
to look for him.

676
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:17,866
He's infected!

677
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:19,925
No, he is not!
He is!

678
01:09:21,003 --> 01:09:23,801
<i>I made you believe that to
make it easier for you to stay.</i>

679
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,844
Please, I got a wife.

680
01:09:37,086 --> 01:09:38,348
Adam. He has a wife.

681
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:40,344
Kids.

682
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:44,048
I got a wife.

683
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:49,023
We can bring him back.

684
01:09:50,233 --> 01:09:51,359
<i>No, we can't.</i>

685
01:09:54,103 --> 01:09:56,298
Let's get some shovels
and bury the man.

686
01:10:16,392 --> 01:10:17,324
<i>That's it for him.</i>

687
01:10:59,368 --> 01:11:01,233
Come inside, Adam.
It's cold.

688
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:02,832
Is it?

689
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:06,707
I can't feel it.

690
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:09,833
Yeah.

691
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,171
Well, you're not immune
to frostbite. So get inside.

692
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:17,543
You know I'm envious of him.

693
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:22,248
Imagine you can't think any more.

694
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:29,755
<i>You can't feel
your way through it all.</i>

695
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:34,201
You don't try
to make sense of it.

696
01:11:35,805 --> 01:11:39,536
It doesn't hurt.
You just are.

697
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:42,499
<i>Forever.</i>

698
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:47,138
In your own vast eternity.

699
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:51,486
You're not dead, Adam.

700
01:11:51,554 --> 01:11:56,150
I feel it. That's the one thing
I do feel is dead.

701
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:03,856
You are more alive
than life itself.

702
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:09,531
You are everything
that life wants to be.

703
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,466
<i>You're endless, Adam.
Forever.</i>

704
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:17,874
I'm leaving tomorrow, Doc.

705
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:21,783
Where would you go?

706
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,384
You'll never see
that girl again.

707
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,556
The world won't
accept you. Or me.

708
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:37,821
<i>Away.</i>

709
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:41,661
I'm just going to go away.

710
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:45,334
Get inside, Adam.

711
01:13:27,116 --> 01:13:28,105
Shit!

712
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:06,477
<i>Blam!</i>

713
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:11,542
<i>Jesus!</i>

714
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:23,487
Adam.

715
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:01,728
Adam.

716
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:31,192
I thought the snowmobile was broken.

717
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:34,126
I fixed it.

718
01:17:37,132 --> 01:17:38,690
You should have
let me die, Doc.

719
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:41,658
I did.

720
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:45,268
You were gone.

721
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:49,266
Yeah.

722
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:50,367
<i>Your injury...</i>

723
01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:55,544
it destroyed
your synaptic pathway.

724
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,108
No.

725
01:17:58,287 --> 01:18:00,847
<i>Adam, don't you see?</i>

726
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:05,586
<i>Your brain...
I brought it back.</i>

727
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,896
There's nothing special
about the brain, Doc.

728
01:18:09,732 --> 01:18:11,222
Ever thought of that?

729
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:14,265
It's just life.

730
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:17,361
Nothing that can't be
turned back on again.

731
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:25,509
Adam. How are you feeling?

732
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:29,549
You robbed me of my life, Doc.
How do you think I feel?

733
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:32,386
I gave you life.

734
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:36,387
No. You let me have
the taste of it.

735
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:38,222
<i>Then you took it
all away.</i>

736
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:42,055
I need you to take it
away one more time.

737
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:48,766
I can't do that.

738
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:50,363
I'm not asking.

739
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,775
I'm telling you to have...

740
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:58,506
You don't seem
to understand.

741
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:01,715
<i>The adjustments
that I made</i>

742
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:04,441
they worked.

743
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:08,648
I have nothing.

744
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:14,160
You're here. You're alive.

745
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:17,289
No, I have nothing.
There's nothing there!

746
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:21,496
There's nothing! Nothing!
I cannot feel anything!

747
01:19:24,206 --> 01:19:26,436
I cannot even feel myself,

748
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:32,269
<i>I can't hear myself. I can't
hear my own damn heartbeat.</i>

749
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:34,377
There's nothing there.

750
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:37,884
This gun...

751
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:40,820
<i>is nothing.</i>

752
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:45,550
Is weight. Dead weight.
I do not feel! I do not exist!

753
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:50,322
You're here, Adam.

754
01:19:50,632 --> 01:19:52,122
I'm not here!

755
01:19:58,907 --> 01:20:00,932
I am nothing.

756
01:20:07,316 --> 01:20:08,544
Doc. Please!

757
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:15,881
Just kill me one
last time.

758
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:18,017
Please.

759
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:20,083
I can't.

760
01:20:25,334 --> 01:20:28,360
<i>You have to, please.</i>

761
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:30,702
You don't seem
to understand, Adam.

762
01:20:33,509 --> 01:20:34,669
I can't.

763
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:38,009
Give me the gun.
You can't.

764
01:20:38,247 --> 01:20:40,340
I don't want to know
what it's like to die.

765
01:20:43,218 --> 01:20:44,515
I want to die.

766
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:49,485
Please, Doc.
That's all I want.

767
01:20:53,495 --> 01:20:55,326
Please, please.

768
01:21:05,674 --> 01:21:06,800
Ahhhh!

769
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:13,470
Click

770
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:18,518
Ahhh hhh

771
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:19,676
Shit.

772
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,262
Congratulations Adam.

773
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,528
We did it.

774
01:21:42,277 --> 01:21:43,175
<i>Want some tea?</i>

775
01:21:57,526 --> 01:21:58,390
Ahh!

776
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:09,867
Ahhhh!

777
01:24:48,563 --> 01:24:51,589
<i>Adaaaaaam!</i>

778
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:05,003
<i>Where are you!</i>

779
01:25:12,053 --> 01:25:14,180
Come back!

780
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,653
<i>We have more work to do!</i>

781
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:25,361
Adaaaaaam.

782
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,403
Come hoooooooooome!

783
01:26:07,843 --> 01:26:10,971
<i>Mental Status... T. B. D.</i>

784
01:26:17,686 --> 01:26:21,554
<i>Mental Status... T. B. D.</i>

785
01:26:24,426 --> 01:26:25,415
Adam?

786
01:26:28,797 --> 01:26:31,891
<i>Mental Status... T. B. D.</i>

787
01:26:37,272 --> 01:26:38,239
Dr. Vick.

788
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:39,764
Hello Ethan.

789
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:47,078
<i>I see you've been playing
a little doctor when I was away.</i>

790
01:26:48,783 --> 01:26:53,413
I get it. If the authorities come,
you go back to your own self

791
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:55,653
and say "Mr. Innocent".

792
01:26:57,692 --> 01:26:58,886
I get it.

793
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:00,391
How did you come back?!

794
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:03,630
I pumped you full of serum.

795
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:08,061
There was nothing. The
brain damage was too severe.

796
01:27:09,571 --> 01:27:14,008
Brain damage?
Do I looked brain damaged?

797
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:18,712
The serum is perfect, Ethan.
I made it that way.

798
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:22,674
Head trauma doesn't stop things.
It just slows it down.

799
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:26,346
You could decapitate me.
I'd come back for more.

800
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:27,615
<i>And the side effects?</i>

801
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:32,022
<i>I fixed them.
I solved it.</i>

802
01:27:32,894 --> 01:27:35,124
<i>I perfect the serum,
not you. I did it.</i>

803
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:37,289
You did nothing.

804
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:42,061
<i>You're a trained monkey
following in my footsteps.</i>

805
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:44,970
Side effects!
Ssssss!

806
01:27:50,912 --> 01:27:53,073
<i>It's a shame what you did to that boy.</i>

807
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:54,675
He was having seizures.

808
01:27:57,419 --> 01:27:59,512
Extreme ones.
I saved his life.

809
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,546
<i>Part of the process, Ethan.</i>

810
01:28:01,623 --> 01:28:04,057
If you knew what you were
doing, you'd know that.

811
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:05,592
You didn't have
to do a thing.

812
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:08,596
You're so
damned impatient.

813
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:11,825
He was in so much pain.

814
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:15,900
Pain is necessary.
You need it to adapt.

815
01:28:16,271 --> 01:28:17,602
If you weren't so numb

816
01:28:17,672 --> 01:28:20,641
you'd actually understand
a few things about feelings.

817
01:28:22,243 --> 01:28:23,676
You're a failure, Ethan.

818
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:26,476
That's why it should
have been you.

819
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:29,612
Not me.

820
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,714
I'm sorry, Dr. Vick.

821
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:36,414
<i>For what I did to you.</i>

822
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:42,218
Yeah.

823
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:48,999
You need to know
your place, Ethan.

824
01:28:50,438 --> 01:28:53,271
You're an assistant...
not God.

825
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,769
Here.

826
01:29:00,915 --> 01:29:04,407
<i>Have a drink,
we still have work to do.</i>

827
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:07,343
<i>Drink it.</i>

828
01:29:16,297 --> 01:29:17,389
There you go.

829
01:29:19,834 --> 01:29:21,028
<i>It's okay.</i>

830
01:29:21,703 --> 01:29:22,692
Drink up.

831
01:29:24,372 --> 01:29:25,361
Drink it!

832
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:33,737
There you go.

833
01:29:37,519 --> 01:29:38,577
<i>Good boy.</i>

834
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:44,481
Aghhh! Mmh!
