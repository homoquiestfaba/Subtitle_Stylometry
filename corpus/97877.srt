2
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,006
Tanaka!

3
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,049
Haven't I told you this is illegal...

4
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,591
...and it pisses me off?

5
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:06,051
You're under arrest.

6
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,721
Not tonight, Kenner.

7
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,432
Kick his ass!

8
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,224
$5,000 on the new guy!

9
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,517
That's a good bet.

10
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:14,886
Was that an offer?

11
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,682
I'm too much woman for you, Kenner-san.

12
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:21,392
You better start with something easier.

13
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:44,991
We are from
the New Merchants Association.

14
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:47,325
You are highly thought of
in the community.

15
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,535
We are looking for a donation.

16
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,661
I give each year,
to fund the lights and the parade.

17
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,748
We were thinking more of a percentage
of your gross profits. From now on...

18
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,126
...deliveries will be kept on time.

19
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,043
The bad element will stay away.

20
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:05,378
You will keep from getting hurt.

21
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,966
Things are changing around here.

22
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,010
The Yakuza will take care of
any problems you may have.

23
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:15,719
The Yakuza? Here?

24
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,389
This is not Tokyo, this is America!

25
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:23,308
I'm only a small businesswoman, please.

26
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,435
You got a problem, fucker?

27
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:31,938
No problem at all.

28
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,277
Come on. Don't do this.

29
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,821
If I don't get breakfast, I get real grumpy.

30
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,947
You wouldn't like me grumpy.

31
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:20,845
Put it down. Now!

32
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:24,306
Come on, Champ.

33
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,405
Police! Hold it!

34
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:08,732
All right, say it.

35
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,261
Asian Task Force. You're Kenner?

36
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:16,735
Nelson sent me. I'm your new partner.

37
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:20,302
Really? Looks like they all got away.
Good job, Officer.

38
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:24,573
All that upper-body strength
really slows you down.

39
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,684
- I'm not slow.
- You didn't hit me.

40
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,633
If I did, you wouldn't be here.

41
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,043
I'm not arguing.

42
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:34,402
But you didn't.

43
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,061
Children.

44
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:41,203
Here's one.

45
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,410
- Should I read him his rights?
- Sure, if it makes you feel better.

46
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,525
But I don't think he's conscious.

47
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,340
You're right.

48
00:10:00,156 --> 00:10:01,317
Down there.

49
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:05,007
Good luck.

50
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:06,252
Sorry.

51
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,326
Good luck.

52
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,937
Too bad. Good luck.

53
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,095
These are my ex-partners.

54
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:15,790
You got a name?

55
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,094
How long you been in LA?

56
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,940
I don't think Bozohead speaks English.

57
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,474
You want to tell me what's going on?

58
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,939
He works for a group called
"Tetsu No Tsume".

59
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,316
The Iron Claw.

60
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:36,280
He's Yakuza, a perversion of the warrior
class. It dates back to the 12th century.

61
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,907
So, they've been pissing you off
for a long time?

62
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:46,540
This isn't going to work. I'll have Nelson
send you back to wherever he found you.

63
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,668
Don't do that.

64
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,631
They don't really want me back.
I have a problem keeping partners, too.

65
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:57,593
I'm not surprised. I hate you already.

66
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,430
I want to find out his boss's name.

67
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,515
- His <i>oyabun</i>.
- <i>Oyabun</i>?

68
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,689
- Lf he tells you, the boss won't be happy.
- His choice.

69
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:14,943
What's he doing?

70
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,529
Motherfucker!

71
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,530
The guy was nuts!

72
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,389
- What the fuck did he do?
- Made his choice.

73
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,091
In his world,
that was the honorable way to die.

74
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,879
What world is that?

75
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,785
Let me get this straight.

76
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:41,193
You lost all your suspects
because you were whacking each other?

77
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:42,772
Yeah, except one.

78
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:45,307
He just broke his own neck.

79
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,376
You arrest the nicest people.

80
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:57,859
Mr. Yoshida, you can have
the Bonsai Club and the girl!

81
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,438
I'll work for you!

82
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,973
Please! I'll give you anything!

83
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,425
No, come on, please!

84
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,665
Get me out of here!

85
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,348
Tanaka should have retired
when we gave him the chance.

86
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,809
One must submit to the inevitable.

87
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:23,890
Hate to see him die that way.
It crushes me.

88
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,078
How you doing?

89
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:53,520
- I thought you quit that stuff.
- I heard something.

90
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:56,964
- The sound of your brain frying.
- They sent guys to kill Tanaka.

91
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,287
What are you talking about?

92
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,436
- These guys scare the shit out of me.
- Why do you still hang around them?

93
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,796
Come with me.
Mr. Yoshida wants to see you.

94
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,404
<i>Tanaka, listen to me.</i>
<i>These guys are bad news.</i>

95
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,852
<i>Who told you they owned a beer factory?</i>

96
00:14:22,936 --> 00:14:26,628
<i>They're talking about taking over</i>
<i>your Bonsai Club, and everything else.</i>

97
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:30,113
<i>I'm not kidding. They'll kill you</i>
<i>if you don't do what they say.</i>

98
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,933
That was foolish.

99
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,884
You're our guest.

100
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,576
Loyalty is an admirable trait.

101
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:43,886
But Mr. Tanaka is retiring.

102
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,459
I don't believe you.

103
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:49,654
He didn't either.

104
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,262
So, you're looking for employment, yes?

105
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,445
Angel, what am I going to do with you?

106
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,705
I could do you.

107
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:09,070
Even in front of these guys.

108
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:24,320
I think I'll do you.

109
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:52,078
A single blow, very clean.
A surgically sharp instrument.

110
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,328
A sword.

111
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,246
Yeah, a sword.

112
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:57,915
I have seen a lot of would-be beheadings.

113
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,917
It's not as easy as it looks.
Whoever did this was very good.

114
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,628
It was also completely redundant.

115
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,171
- How do you mean?
- Open this, please.

116
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,799
The eyes are still dilated.
It's very strange after death.

117
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:12,174
So I did a prelim.

118
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:16,136
There were enough methamphetamines
in her system to kill her.

119
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:19,804
- What kind?
- It's called ice. Big in Japan, but not here.

120
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,723
It makes rock look like decaf.

121
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:26,809
If it breaks wide, there'll be a plague
like you have never seen.

122
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:30,229
- Thanks, Russell.
- Anytime.

123
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:34,190
This is a weird part of town.

124
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:49,492
How come you don't know
a goddamn thing about your own culture?

125
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,285
My culture?

126
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:54,705
Listen, Champ. I was raised in the Valley.

127
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,457
My dad's a white guy who's a dentist.

128
00:17:57,582 --> 00:18:02,001
I know about malls,
MTV, driving Dad's car on Mulholland.

129
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:04,712
That doesn't explain the Bushido.

130
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,548
Mom made me study martial arts
to get a Japanese identity.

131
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:14,342
Actually, she had this idea about
flower arranging first, but be serious.

132
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,678
What's your excuse?

133
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,013
I was raised in Japan.

134
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,682
Did you have to do
that flower-arranging stuff?

135
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:27,144
A warrior who knows only one side
leaves himself vulnerable to attack.

136
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:30,062
Many of the greatest samurai
also wrote haiku.

137
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,689
Those poems that don't rhyme.

138
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:40,069
This is the Bonsai Club. Japanese come
here for their own special kind of fun.

139
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:43,030
Get ready for some sudden
cultural immersion.

140
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:46,949
I'll warn you, I don't eat raw fish.
But that's just me.

141
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,205
I can't exactly get in the front.
They don't like me.

142
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:56,039
Why aren't I surprised?

143
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:10,341
Does everyone around here know you?

144
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,133
They know who I am.

145
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,103
Come on in.

146
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,295
How long did you study?

147
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:06,130
Since I was four.

148
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:10,383
You should have started earlier.
That would've helped your form.

149
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,051
I was four!

150
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,845
There's nothing wrong with my form.

151
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,986
Sushi in the raw.

152
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:43,656
You know what I said about the fish?

153
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,783
I could change my mind.

154
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:05,963
What did he say?

155
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,591
Something very strange.

156
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:15,678
See that girl singing?

157
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,264
God! Yeah.

158
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:22,725
You're right.

159
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:25,352
I could get immersed in some of that.

160
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:28,521
She hung out with a girl
that comes in two parts now.

161
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:29,938
You remember Angel?

162
00:21:40,322 --> 00:21:42,156
Don't mention Angel's dead.

163
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:43,740
Not yet, anyway.

164
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:54,289
We're looking for Angel Mueller.
Have you seen her?

165
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:56,791
You must be Sgt. Kenner.

166
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,709
Everybody does know you.

167
00:21:58,876 --> 00:22:00,710
I shouldn't be talking to you.

168
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:04,171
When'd you last see her?

169
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:07,591
- She was at the party last night.
- Who was the party for?

170
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:10,009
The Red Dragon Brewery. The new owner.

171
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,134
Of the brewery?

172
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:14,262
Of the club. The owner of the brewery
now owns the club.

173
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,806
Did you see Angel leave the party?

174
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:19,891
They sent her to see him
and I never saw her again, okay?

175
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,183
See who?

176
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,272
You know where to find me
if you need to talk to me.

177
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,150
Sweet!

178
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,575
We have a problem.

179
00:22:45,826 --> 00:22:47,451
Let's go!

180
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,251
Maybe we should have paid the cover.

181
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:41,865
Thanks.

182
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,876
Down, motherfucker!

183
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,567
You'll be fine.

184
00:24:32,902 --> 00:24:35,570
If they wanted to kill us,
they already would have.

185
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:38,988
I have a real bad feeling about this.

186
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:40,657
There's no problem.

187
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,075
Just play by their rules.

188
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,701
Be polite. Show respect.

189
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:27,231
Have we met before?

190
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,774
Last time I saw you, your face matched.

191
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:34,652
I knew you would come some day.
You saved me the trouble of waiting.

192
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:39,781
- You should have finished the job then.
- I'll do it for you now.

193
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,452
I don't think so.

194
00:25:57,377 --> 00:25:58,377
Cop.

195
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:00,337
Policeman. Understand?

196
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,588
It's bad to shoot me.

197
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:04,674
He's a cop, too.

198
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,800
It's bad to shoot him.

199
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:11,845
Shit.

200
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,391
You don't like this guy?

201
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:20,601
I understand you don't like this guy.

202
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:23,395
But you shoot him and you're scum.

203
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:27,773
This is not the way.

204
00:26:28,983 --> 00:26:31,318
You give up everything you are, Champ.

205
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:33,986
All your Japanese-warrior bullshit.

206
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:37,905
And you get me killed, too.

207
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,744
Can you hear me?

208
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,458
- Are you going to kill him?
- Not right now.

209
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,792
Maybe later.

210
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:04,758
I've put us in a fucked situation.

211
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:28,524
You, too.

212
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,379
What's the matter with you?
Are you out of your mind?

213
00:27:57,545 --> 00:28:00,297
You said "be polite"! That was not polite!

214
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:07,260
You better drive.

215
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:15,516
There's something you're not telling me.

216
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:19,309
If we are going to go any further,
let's discuss it, or you can go alone.

217
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:22,521
- I'll go alone.
- That's not good enough.

218
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:31,653
Listen, you <i>Zen</i> warrior,
fucking samurai asshole!

219
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,654
I want to know what's up.

220
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:36,447
Because, despite myself, I like you.

221
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:42,660
I don't want to see you dead.

222
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,084
I was brought up in Japan.

223
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:56,503
My father was an MP
with the occupational forces.

224
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:59,005
When I was nine,
both my parents were murdered.

225
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,340
I saw it done.

226
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:08,094
The man who killed them
wore the tattoo of the Iron Claw.

227
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:10,430
I saw him as he killed my parents.

228
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:13,390
I struck him in the face
with his own sword.

229
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:16,100
It was Yoshida.

230
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:19,978
That's perfect.

231
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:25,607
I'm partner with a homicidal maniac
on a vendetta of family vengeance.

232
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:31,360
I'll tell Nelson this isn't working out
and get you reassigned.

233
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:35,030
Like hell you will.

234
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,532
Will you do this right?

235
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,075
Clean.

236
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,745
Like a cop in the 20th century
and not some samurai warrior?

237
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:47,331
We'll nail this guy.

238
00:29:47,956 --> 00:29:52,083
And when we're done,
we'll go eat fish off those naked chicks.

239
00:30:14,975 --> 00:30:17,393
- What's the deal?
- Looks like business to me.

240
00:30:27,484 --> 00:30:32,111
It's funny, me being in Little Tokyo.
I never expected to work this part of town.

241
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,365
It's reverse racism, if you think about it.

242
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:37,616
I wanted to work in Malibu.

243
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,617
That will never happen.

244
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,826
Thanks, that's supportive.

245
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:46,372
I've joined you on a quest for personal
vengeance and you shoot at my dreams?

246
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:49,624
Malibu is Sheriff's Department, not LAPD.

247
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,083
Really?

248
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,168
Damn.

249
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:05,468
What's this place?

250
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,554
Must be the Red Dragon Brewery.

251
00:31:07,637 --> 00:31:10,847
Remember, the owner of the club
is also the owner of the brewery?

252
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:24,065
That arrogant, scumbag, motherfucker.
He put the iron claw right on the logo.

253
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:45,372
I have a feeling that explains the ice.

254
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:58,423
You may remember,
we discussed arresting this man legally.

255
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,885
I'm not going to shoot
until they shoot at us.

256
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:09,722
The problem of introducing a new product
to the marketplace is distribution.

257
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:12,433
That problem has been solved.

258
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:16,019
Red Dragon Beer will have
its own national network of trucks.

259
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,812
The world around us changes, gentlemen.

260
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,230
The Berlin Wall falls.

261
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,774
Russia's no longer a superpower.

262
00:32:25,525 --> 00:32:28,694
America's corrupt
with greedy politicians and police.

263
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:32,572
The world looks to Japan
for economic leadership.

264
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,823
Enough bullshit! Talk price.

265
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:36,115
Yeah, price!

266
00:32:37,867 --> 00:32:39,826
Twenty percent above wholesale.

267
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:41,953
It'll put us out of fucking business!

268
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:43,120
Bullshit!

269
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:45,831
Not if we run it and distribute it to you.

270
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:47,165
You run the crank business?

271
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,417
No way! Go home, fucking slopehead!

272
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:57,506
Shit!

273
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:01,717
Now you have one hand left
to wipe your ass with.

274
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:03,468
You want to keep it?

275
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:04,802
We have a deal?

276
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:07,888
How about you?

277
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:09,764
Yeah, we got a deal!

278
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,000
Minako.

279
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:53,920
Mr. Yoshida.

280
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,636
For the beauty.

281
00:34:05,804 --> 00:34:06,929
Thank you.

282
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,598
I enjoyed your singing.

283
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,768
Any other duties?

284
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:17,436
I sing.

285
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:23,524
I don't understand my countrymen's
obsession with these other women.

286
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:27,152
Forbidden fruit, I guess.

287
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,657
I find the apple outside my door
is the sweetest.

288
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,331
Beauty must be possessed and protected.

289
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,500
I will own you and you will appreciate it.

290
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,084
Please, don't...

291
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:08,389
Obey me, or this will happen to you!

292
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:24,233
So this is America.

293
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,527
I think I'll like it here.

294
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:33,698
She's enjoying herself.
Make sure she stays. Nobody in or out.

295
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:48,584
He's leaving.

296
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:59,050
It's that girl from the club.
The one we talked to.

297
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,593
- What's she up to?
- Straightening up.

298
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:04,262
Laying things out real carefully.

299
00:36:04,346 --> 00:36:06,138
Someone left a big knife out.

300
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:07,514
Hand me that.

301
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:15,186
Kenner, come on!

302
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:18,522
She's making preparations for <i>seppuku</i>.

303
00:36:18,606 --> 00:36:19,898
What's <i>seppuku</i>?

304
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:21,941
Ritual suicide.

305
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:25,777
It's rarely done by women unless
they've been irredeemably dishonored.

306
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:32,657
You take the car. Follow Yoshida.

307
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:37,869
There must be nine guys in there.

308
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:34,618
I have dishonored you.

309
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:38,496
For the improper guarding of your house.

310
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:39,663
Please...

311
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,541
...accept my apologies.

312
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,918
When the safety's off,
point this at the target...

313
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:48,629
...pull the trigger and they'll fall down.

314
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:57,343
Where's he now?

315
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:59,387
I'll be there.

316
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:08,226
Shoot anything you see move.

317
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,228
What if it's you?

318
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,188
You won't see me coming.

319
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:36,121
The water must be out at the house.
They all went in to take a bath.

320
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,122
Come on.

321
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,543
What happened at the house?

322
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:46,795
Minako's fine,
but I had to kill nine of them.

323
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:50,464
We're so far outside on this one
it's not even funny.

324
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:54,216
Scared?

325
00:42:58,095 --> 00:42:59,345
- No.
- You should be.

326
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:12,105
What the fuck do you want? We're closed.

327
00:43:13,522 --> 00:43:15,023
Wrong. You're open.

328
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,110
- He's in there.
- Thanks, asshole.

329
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,165
Up against the wall.

330
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,249
Now!

331
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:43,752
Back off!

332
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:12,064
You have a problem, Officer?

333
00:44:12,147 --> 00:44:15,316
You're the problem.
You're going to the station.

334
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:21,320
What are the charges?

335
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:23,571
Let's start with Angel Mueller's murder.

336
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,657
The illegal manufacture and sale
of methamphetamines.

337
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:29,200
You have nothing.

338
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:30,701
We have a witness.

339
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,870
And you've got a bad habit
of taping things.

340
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,372
Also, you have a problem getting it up.

341
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,958
So, just don't waste my time.

342
00:44:39,124 --> 00:44:40,458
Get your clothes on.

343
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,542
Don't give me an excuse to kill you.

344
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:44,294
Name your price.

345
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:46,170
I always wanted a Porsche.

346
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:48,880
That's right.

347
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:53,926
The report read, "Kenner killed
a naked man in a bathhouse."

348
00:44:54,718 --> 00:44:58,054
That would do little to glorify the honor
of your father's name.

349
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,554
Get your fucking hands up!

350
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:02,057
You don't have the honor
to speak of my father.

351
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:29,953
Let's find Yoshida.

352
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,418
This will sound strange from a cop.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

353
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:10,522
It's okay. We gotta get you out of here.

354
00:48:10,815 --> 00:48:11,773
I have a place.

355
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,442
Say hi to Johnny. He's with us.

356
00:48:54,012 --> 00:48:57,014
It's not much, but I hope you like it.

357
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,849
Shoes.

358
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:14,943
It'll get warm in a couple of minutes.

359
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:17,528
Next time, get a furnished place.

360
00:49:31,163 --> 00:49:33,915
There's some sweats and stuff there.

361
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:37,042
Try to get some sleep.

362
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,334
Thanks.

363
00:49:45,548 --> 00:49:48,550
Maybe there's a hotel down the road.

364
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:54,261
Get some sleep.
There are three rooms, three futons.

365
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:57,556
What's a futon?

366
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:20,239
Sorry.

367
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:22,949
I'll try to make more noise next time.

368
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,248
This is a nice place.

369
00:50:32,706 --> 00:50:34,040
I built it.

370
00:50:34,374 --> 00:50:36,208
Somehow, I knew that.

371
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:40,670
Close your eyes.

372
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:01,643
Hot.

373
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:11,275
Why did you do what you did
up at the house?

374
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:15,318
Sometimes you do the right thing
because you don't have to.

375
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,989
Most people do the right thing
only when it's easy for them.

376
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:24,616
I could've quit that job at the club,
but it was such easy money.

377
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:29,120
It's harder to do the right thing
for the right reason than you know.

378
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,290
You're a real man.

379
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:49,510
I'm too scared to stay in there by myself.

380
00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:53,929
I'll stay on my side.

381
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:55,848
Do you hog the blankets?

382
00:51:57,474 --> 00:51:58,975
I brought my own.

383
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:14,694
What?

384
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,279
That time...

385
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:20,074
...I heard you coming.

386
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:36,418
What's wrong?

387
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:49,386
- We got company.
- How many?

388
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,804
I'm not sure yet. Many many.

389
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:55,640
- Where's Minako?
- She's in my room.

390
00:53:57,725 --> 00:53:59,726
I knew that was going to happen.

391
00:54:01,061 --> 00:54:02,270
She was frightened.

392
00:54:03,146 --> 00:54:06,231
I saw you strip down for that hot tub.
I'd be frightened, too.

393
00:54:13,153 --> 00:54:14,820
We're in trouble, Champ.

394
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:17,239
There are more bad guys
than we have bullets.

395
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,157
Take this.

396
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,741
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

397
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,419
In case we get killed, I wanted to tell you...

398
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:39,171
...you have the biggest dick
I've ever seen on a man.

399
00:54:39,671 --> 00:54:40,754
Thanks.

400
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:43,841
- I don't know what to say.
- How about, "Don't get killed"?

401
00:54:44,383 --> 00:54:46,217
- Don't get killed.
- You, too.

402
00:54:59,019 --> 00:54:59,769
Nice.

403
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,438
It's like one of those video games.
You just defeated the first wave.

404
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:07,024
You have moments
when you're truly an asshole.

405
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,633
They win.

406
00:56:46,594 --> 00:56:49,763
Meet Hagata, master of pain.

407
00:56:52,014 --> 00:56:55,183
He can find the smallest secret
in a man's mind.

408
00:57:05,274 --> 00:57:06,607
We don't know anything.

409
00:57:06,692 --> 00:57:08,901
He's going to do this anyway. Don't beg.

410
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:09,985
Beg?

411
00:57:10,403 --> 00:57:11,528
Fuck you.

412
00:57:19,784 --> 00:57:22,536
In between cooking cycles,
you're supposed to baste us.

413
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:24,996
That's right, you fucking idiots!

414
00:57:26,748 --> 00:57:29,666
You've always thought of yourself
as a man of honor...

415
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,751
...but obviously that's not enough.

416
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,960
Once, I thought you'd kill me first.

417
00:57:34,044 --> 00:57:36,212
But I also thought that of your father.

418
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:43,175
You are much like him.

419
00:57:44,718 --> 00:57:48,720
You should've gotten to know him better,
but you didn't have much choice.

420
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:50,972
Fucker!

421
00:57:57,311 --> 00:58:01,646
At a higher voltage, your muscles
will contract so much, they'll snap in two.

422
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,983
We will watch this in private.

423
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:22,912
How American.

424
00:58:23,245 --> 00:58:24,829
The back seat.

425
00:58:24,954 --> 00:58:27,373
The movies. A beautiful girl.

426
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:31,793
You know what's missing?

427
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:33,585
Popcorn.

428
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:40,590
This is either going to be very right
or very wrong.

429
00:58:55,142 --> 00:58:56,559
Well done.

430
00:58:57,269 --> 00:58:59,270
Get me the fuck off of here.

431
00:59:34,421 --> 00:59:36,505
Let's find that asshole.

432
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:40,924
Where is everyone?

433
00:59:41,008 --> 00:59:42,926
I don't know. Let's go find them.

434
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:52,182
Watch out!

435
00:59:59,104 --> 01:00:01,480
Bad news. The asshole found us first.

436
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,201
- Where are we going?
- Someplace bad.

437
01:00:37,381 --> 01:00:38,882
Come on, you...

438
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:52,725
Holy shit!

439
01:00:54,894 --> 01:00:57,395
Do some of that muscleman stuff, Kenner!

440
01:01:02,566 --> 01:01:04,567
With your fucking legs, push!

441
01:01:54,602 --> 01:01:56,979
- What did that mean?
- Roughly translated:

442
01:01:57,104 --> 01:02:01,022
Out of the frying pan
and boned up the ass with a red-hot poker.

443
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:03,066
There you have it.

444
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:04,775
I liked that car.

445
01:02:04,943 --> 01:02:09,404
And I like that girl. I'd like to cut off
some parts of Yoshida's anatomy.

446
01:02:09,488 --> 01:02:11,739
You've got a fixation, pal.

447
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:14,950
Shall we climb down and kick some ass?

448
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,577
Let's enjoy being dead for a while.

449
01:02:19,453 --> 01:02:20,537
Trust me.

450
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,789
They'll be surprised when we show up.

451
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:16,659
At 3:00 a.m., the first shipments of Red
Dragon will leave for national distribution.

452
01:03:17,077 --> 01:03:18,911
It's a glorious time, gentlemen.

453
01:03:19,746 --> 01:03:21,580
A time for celebration.

454
01:03:30,295 --> 01:03:35,131
Now America can enjoy our beer
and our drugs while watching football.

455
01:03:56,188 --> 01:03:57,188
Good evening.

456
01:04:03,193 --> 01:04:05,736
One for you. One for me.

457
01:04:06,362 --> 01:04:08,863
It's no coincidence that we've timed...

458
01:04:08,947 --> 01:04:11,698
...the launching of our venture
with the Spring Festival.

459
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:14,784
It fortuitously ensures our success
in this enterprise.

460
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:18,661
Have you fortuitously gotten those cops
off your ass?

461
01:04:19,496 --> 01:04:21,622
You talk all this shit. What's up?

462
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,832
We chewed them up and spit them out.
Any other questions?

463
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,124
I guess not.

464
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:28,126
Do we look like truck drivers?

465
01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:31,545
Oh, well.

466
01:04:50,393 --> 01:04:51,434
Nothing we can't handle.

467
01:04:51,518 --> 01:04:53,686
Call us when you've handled it, pal.

468
01:04:53,979 --> 01:04:55,729
Let's get the fuck out of here!

469
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:06,736
Keep going?

470
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:08,238
Keep going.

471
01:05:35,382 --> 01:05:37,049
Knock, knock. We're here!

472
01:05:54,855 --> 01:05:55,980
You're dead!

473
01:05:56,105 --> 01:05:57,606
It sucked. We came back.

474
01:05:58,773 --> 01:06:00,649
Kill them. Send them back to hell!

475
01:06:55,856 --> 01:06:57,523
I've got Yoshida!

476
01:07:09,615 --> 01:07:10,615
Yeah, pal.

477
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,575
You are under arrest.

478
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,057
I said, "You're under arrest."

479
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:02,986
You have the right to remain silent.

480
01:09:10,658 --> 01:09:12,492
You have the right to an attorney.

481
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:36,092
You have the right to be dead.

482
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:52,854
Minako!

483
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:11,117
Leave her out of this.
It's between you and me.

484
01:10:12,702 --> 01:10:14,745
All right. It doesn't matter.

485
01:10:15,913 --> 01:10:17,914
Just as long as you die.

486
01:10:48,894 --> 01:10:50,061
You okay?

487
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,981
It's not over yet!

488
01:10:55,232 --> 01:10:56,816
Take care of her.

489
01:11:45,184 --> 01:11:46,517
Get back!

490
01:11:59,027 --> 01:12:00,360
Is he okay?

491
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,279
It went straight through.

492
01:12:03,697 --> 01:12:05,114
Stay out of this!

493
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:06,990
I won't watch him kill you.

494
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:09,284
If that happens, you will.

495
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,704
Kick his ass, samurai.

496
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,123
Go ahead. Use your gun.

497
01:12:19,249 --> 01:12:21,584
You don't have the honor
to fight like a man.

498
01:12:21,877 --> 01:12:24,045
You do believe in fate, don't you?

499
01:13:54,024 --> 01:13:54,816
Take him!

500
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:03,322
This is for my parents.

501
01:14:43,143 --> 01:14:44,935
Nice slicing and dicing, partner.

502
01:15:07,826 --> 01:15:09,952
What do we call this in the police report?

503
01:15:10,037 --> 01:15:11,829
How about, "Community relations"?

504
01:15:11,996 --> 01:15:14,664
We blew up the crime scene,
killed the suspects...

505
01:15:14,831 --> 01:15:16,665
And joined the local parade.

506
01:15:17,042 --> 01:15:18,209
I like it.
