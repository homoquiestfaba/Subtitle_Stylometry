1
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,236
Joe?

2
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,343
Stay back. Stay back.

3
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:58,322
Joe, I'm Phoebe MacNamara.
I'm with the Police Department.

4
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,690
- Brought you a beer.
- What?

5
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,526
Put it on the ledge.

6
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:12,135
Phoebe, Tactical is moving into position.
Be careful.

7
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,419
You planning on jumping?

8
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,014
Don't tell me it's over a woman.

9
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,918
My wife.

10
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,594
Why don't you sit back down?

11
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,686
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,038
So what's your wife's name?

13
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,840
Lori.

14
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,716
She left me.

15
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:04,148
- You really a cop?
- Yes.

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,385
She left you 'cause you were gambling?

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,057
She was all I had.

18
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,667
Aren't you gonna get in trouble
for drinking?

19
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,968
Not if you don't jump.

20
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,207
I stole $5,000 from my boss.

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,111
I met your boss.
He seems like a really nice guy.

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,223
What if I talked to him, got him
to give you time to pay the money back?

23
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,560
I don't know.

24
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,968
If you could talk to her right now,
what would you say?

25
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,271
I guess that I'm sorry,

26
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,707
that I love her, and I don't wanna lose her.

27
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:03,680
Well, if you don't wanna lose her
and you really love her, Joe,

28
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,548
you gotta hand me the gun
and get off this ledge, okay?

29
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,056
Otherwise you're just leaving Lori
with a whole lot of grief and guilt.

30
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,594
I don't wanna do that. It's not her fault.

31
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,724
Then show her that.

32
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,548
Give me your hand.

33
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,385
Come on.

34
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,930
You'll have to go with this officer.

35
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:12,208
Lieutenant, I am just going to pretend
you didn't give a beer to a jumper.

36
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,946
- What beer, Captain?
- Exactly.

37
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,021
You always go right up to guys
with guns like that?

38
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,221
Only on Sundays. You pressing charges?

39
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,697
No, no. Listen, I don't
want Joe to go to jail.

40
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,295
He's worked for me for three years.
He's never been a problem.

41
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,030
Well, he's gonna have to pay
the money back he owes you

42
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,606
- for his own self- respect.
- Okay.

43
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,966
Hey.

44
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,579
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I just had one.

45
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,856
- Carly, you ready?
- I'm ready.

46
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,858
It's too cold for shorts, sweetie.

47
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,698
- Put your foot in. Other foot.
- Don't forget my scrunchie.

48
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,562
Okay. Shoes.

49
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:02,958
Down there.

50
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,230
I can put my shoes on all by myself, Mommy.

51
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,102
Okay, you do that.
I'll see you downstairs, okay?

52
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,304
- What are you doing?
- We have a leak.

53
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,244
- Great.
- I've almost got her lunch made.

54
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,680
- I just need to add the apple juice.
- Thanks, Mom.

55
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,910
Carly!

56
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,812
Carly. Come here, baby.

57
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,548
There's my girl.

58
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,717
- We have a leak.
- Yes, we do.

59
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,121
There we go. Let's get your shoe on.

60
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,821
Put your foot to the back.

61
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:35,890
- I want my froggy backpack.
- Well, I can't find it, sweetheart.

62
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,469
Hey, Mom, will you flag down
the bus for me?

63
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,731
I haven't got time to drive her
if she doesn't make it.

64
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,137
Got a training session at 8:00.

65
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,443
What's wrong?

66
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,940
Grandma can't go on the porch anymore.

67
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,082
Since when?

68
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,209
I've got it. I've got it.

69
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,122
- Come on.
- Here's your lunch. Into the froggy.

70
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,956
There you go.

71
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,556
- Big girl.
- Come on.

72
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,290
- Hold my hand.
- Here we go. There we go.

73
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,025
We missed the bus.

74
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,960
You can catch it on Colby.

75
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,642
Can you come to help with my class today?

76
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,404
I can't, sweetie. I gotta go to work.

77
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,911
Well, all the other mommies do,
but you never come.

78
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,106
Next week, okay? I promise.

79
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,612
Come on. You got your backpack?
Watch your head.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,627
We need a new car.

81
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,148
Okay, today we're gonna
continue our discussion

82
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,745
about your role as first responders.

83
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,982
Ma'am?

84
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,185
I was wondering about
that jumper yesterday.

85
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,457
You broke a lot of your own
rules of negotiation.

86
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,063
It's Lieutenant, Officer Meeks.

87
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,499
And if you'd been paying attention
over the past two weeks,

88
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,934
you would've heard me say
that while there are guidelines,

89
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,769
- a negotiator must be flexible.
- You gave the subject alcohol.

90
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,868
And you had some yourself.
Is that what you call being flexible, ma'am?

91
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,003
Oh, sorry.

92
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,877
- Lieutenant.
- Lieutenant?

93
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,348
Did you read the report, Officer?

94
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,609
Because if you had, you might've noticed

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,814
that a sniper had his M4
trained on the subject.

96
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,684
- He could've missed.
- From 40 feet?

97
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,625
The preservation of life is and will
always be the primary goal in negotiation.

98
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,530
Everything else is secondary.

99
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,502
In this instance, I elected a face to face.

100
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,505
I elected to give the subject a single beer

101
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,804
because I thought these choices
would assist me in talking him down.

102
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,074
That's a good strategy.
Unless he gets drunk and falls off the roof.

103
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,712
Or you do.

104
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,886
Maybe you get drunk off one beer, Officer,
but I don't.

105
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,720
Can't you take the elevator
like a normal person?

106
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,422
And miss you struggling to keep up?

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,895
What?

108
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,567
It's that guy from yesterday.

109
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,176
- Wonder what he wants.
- Who cares?

110
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,244
Hot man, your office. Go.

111
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,056
- Hi.
- Hi.

112
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,421
So.

113
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,565
Wow, this is where
a hostage negotiator works, huh?

114
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,742
You have kids.

115
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,378
Yeah, I have a daughter.

116
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,838
So, what can I do for you?

117
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,585
Actually I think I'm in some trouble.

118
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:17,349
Had a dream last night that I was
sitting on the ledge in my underwear.

119
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,583
- Boxers or briefs?
- Boxers.

120
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,926
Thought I might ask a professional
what this means.

121
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,657
Maybe it means you should wear briefs.

122
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,001
- You know I'm hitting on you, right?
- I'm a trained observer.

123
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,729
So have dinner with me tomorrow night.

124
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:36,401
- What if I said I was suicidal?
- I'd say call the hotline.

125
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,138
You're the hotline.

126
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,613
Drinks, tomorrow, 5:30.

127
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,310
- 6:00.
- 5:45.

128
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,850
My place, Swifty's.
It's on Fourth Street. I can pick you up.

129
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,653
- I'll meet you there.
- Okay.

130
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:56,984
Never seen him.

131
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,494
Roy called today.

132
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,563
Great. Let me guess.
He's gonna be late with child support.

133
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,768
Your ex- husband is an idiot,
I'll give you that.

134
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,403
- What did the mechanic say?
- $600.

135
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,213
- What about the ceiling?
- $400.

136
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,375
And that's the good news.

137
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,477
The plumber said we have to replace
all of our pipes.

138
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,556
Don't even ask how much.

139
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,292
Mom, when did you start having trouble
with the porch?

140
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,965
I started having anxiety
about a month or two.

141
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,472
I'm fine, Phoebe.
I have my chat rooms, online bridge, this.

142
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,876
Stop worrying so much.
Tell me more about this date.

143
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,952
So, are you gonna have a boyfriend?

144
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:04,056
Kaitlyn's mom has a boyfriend.
She says it's a lot of work.

145
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,191
Well, it can be a lot
of work, but then again,

146
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,895
Kaitlyn's mom is a little high- maintenance.

147
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,666
What's high- maintenance, Mama?

148
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,938
It means she needs a lot of attention.
And don't you repeat that.

149
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,775
Okay?

150
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,828
I've been trying to figure out
why I can't get you out of my head.

151
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,869
It's the whole woman- carrying- a- gun thing.

152
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,204
No, it's not.

153
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,278
It's what you did with Joe out on the ledge.

154
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,146
How did you know what to say to him?

155
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,616
I don't know.
I guess I just watch a lot of TV, so...

156
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,553
- Okay, you're a smartass.
- Takes one to like one.

157
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,721
How'd you get into this?
I mean, you don't seem...

158
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,458
- Like I fit the profile?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,100
It's my second year on the force,

160
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,138
and my partner and I were
the first responders at the scene.

161
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,106
- First squad car. And the HT had them...
- H... What?

162
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:24,335
- Hostage- taker.
- Okay.

163
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,810
He had his estranged wife
and three kids in there.

164
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,680
I talked him down before backup arrived
and that was kind of when I decided

165
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,650
- that's what I wanted to do.
- Wow.

166
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,349
What about you?
What you do takes a lot of work, I'm sure.

167
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,984
Owning a bar? No, not so much.

168
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,324
I mean, I was a bartender before, right.
I know the business.

169
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,398
Pour drinks, serve, thank you.

170
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,990
I meant owning three bars

171
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,666
and being a silent partner
in four downtown hotels.

172
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,336
You googled me.

173
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,434
You know what the problem
with googling is?

174
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,139
What, you might find out the man
you're going on a date with

175
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,580
won $100 million in the lottery?

176
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,208
- Yeah, that.
- Right, that.

177
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,550
I was gonna say it takes
all the fun out of it.

178
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,557
Is the money a plus or a minus?

179
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,793
It's a plus that you didn't lead with it.

180
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,133
Well, that's good because I was...

181
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,097
- I gotta go.
- What?

182
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,675
- Yeah.
- Hold on, hold on.

183
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,834
Have dinner with me tomorrow night.

184
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,211
Look, Duncan, despite your $100 million,

185
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,220
I'm not really in a position
to start a relationship right now.

186
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,587
Are you in a position to eat?

187
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,757
What you gotta understand is
you are not in control here. I am in control.

188
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,162
You're gonna put the gun down...

189
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,700
Lieutenant. First responder's off the rails.

190
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,793
He's been yelling at the HT.
He's got him all worked up.

191
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,065
- Where's Tactical?
- Five away.

192
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,934
Look, pal, this is getting ridiculous.

193
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,634
We both know you're not gonna
shoot anyone.

194
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,110
Why don't you call me back
when you're ready to talk?

195
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,175
Officer, situation?

196
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,781
HT's name is Grady. Two hostages.
Witnesses heard gunfire.

197
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,048
When I arrived, he yelled out
if anybody tries to come in,

198
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,784
- he'll shoot them both.
- That's it?

199
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,986
He says his lawyer cheated him
out of $10,000 and he wants it back.

200
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,960
Who's working the log?

201
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,255
Hey, I've been trying to keep this guy
from killing two people.

202
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,993
There hasn't been time for a log.

203
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,001
Have you talked to any of the hostages?

204
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,469
Do you know if anyone needs
medical attention?

205
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,938
You're relieved.
Everything gets written down.

206
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,474
Get the HT on the phone.

207
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,568
Hey, I'm the one keeping this
from blowing up.

208
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,248
- Hey.
- Hold it.

209
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,517
- Yes?
- Mr. Grady?

210
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,123
- Yes.
- This is Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara.

211
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,422
Is that the way you people think
you can talk to me?

212
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,520
- I have a gun.
- No, that was someone else.

213
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,795
You'll be talking to me now.
Is everyone okay in there?

214
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,631
I don't wanna talk anymore.

215
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,433
No one is listening to me. No one cares.

216
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm listening, Mr. Grady. I care.

217
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,104
No, you don't.

218
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,917
Put that back.

219
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,905
So, you did not call for backup,
you did not start a log,

220
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,804
you did not ask about the hostages.

221
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,877
Not to mention, you goaded the HT.

222
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,377
I had it under control.

223
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:51,108
I took statements from all the officers
on the scene and the hostages.

224
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,514
They all described how you berated
the hostage- taker.

225
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,712
You're just looking for someone to blame
for your screw up.

226
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,187
My actions will hold up, Officer.

227
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,587
Yours won't.

228
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,956
You're suspended for 30 days.

229
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,326
No, no, no, you are not running off
on me like this.

230
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,690
You're free to protest the suspension,

231
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,030
but Captain McVee is
in complete agreement with me.

232
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,660
Which comes as no surprise,
considering you're doing him.

233
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,966
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

234
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,508
This is gonna get worse for you, bitch.

235
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,633
That's a promise.

236
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,735
Badge and weapon, Officer.

237
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,357
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

238
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,432
Hi. You must be Carly.

239
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,140
Hi.

240
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,566
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.

241
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,779
More flowers?

242
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,945
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. These aren't for you.

243
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,947
These are for you.

244
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,447
Thanks.

245
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,520
Thank you.

246
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,058
Duncan, this is my mother, Essie.

247
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,184
- Hi, Duncan.
- Hi.

248
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,818
Would you like a drink?

249
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,160
Oh, that's okay, Mom.
We should probably get going.

250
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,132
- Bye. I love you.
- I love you, too.

251
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,863
Carly, come here.

252
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,936
I love you.

253
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:27,039
Carly's pretty well adjusted, considering.

254
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,876
Her father took off when she was a year
old and has only seen her twice since.

255
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,384
He's a jerk.

256
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,614
Well, at least she has you.

257
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:42,025
And your mom, which is great for you
because you have a built- in babysitter.

258
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,118
- Yes and no.
- Yeah?

259
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,891
She's agoraphobic, so...

260
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,633
Agoraphobic?
Like she can't leave the house?

261
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,864
- Yeah.
- Oh wow, that's tough.

262
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,339
How long has she been like that?

263
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,542
- It's been about 15 years.
- Wow.

264
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,045
- Not a second date story.
- Yeah. Okay.

265
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,076
So, where are we going?

266
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:12,054
We are going that way.

267
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,031
Oh, my gosh.

268
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,626
- I love this Ferris wheel.
- Yeah.

269
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,896
- I thought they were gonna tear it down.
- They were.

270
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,462
I bought it from the city and I restored it,
then I donated it back to them.

271
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,373
Couldn't stand the thought of it just
sitting in some dump, somewhere.

272
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,207
Used to ride it all the
time when I was a kid.

273
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,247
- You kidding? So did I.
- What?

274
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,145
- Do you remember the guy who ran it?
- Benny.

275
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,581
- Benny.
- Benny.

276
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,811
And he had a glass eye.

277
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,217
- Yeah, and neither of them matched.
- No.

278
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,653
Appetizer?

279
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,857
Cotton candy.

280
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,656
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

281
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,023
Oh, dude.

282
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,998
I'm sorry, Bill. Can I have one, too?

283
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,930
- Here we are.
- Thanks.

284
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,430
So what's for dinner?

285
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,198
Ah, we have

286
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,771
corn dogs,

287
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,702
onion rings and "zee French fry."

288
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,783
Well I have to say, I'm impressed.

289
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,981
Really? I wasn't trying to impress you.

290
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,788
Yes, you were.

291
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,353
Wanna take a ride?

292
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:14,200
Lieutenant? I might have to take a day off
later this week.

293
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,967
- That's fine. Just let me know, okay?
- Lieutenant?

294
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,204
- Annie, can it wait? I'm gonna be late, okay?
- I know, right.

295
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,373
What I was gonna say is that,
I know I'm new here,

296
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,647
- but I just I hope I'm doing a good job. So...
- You're doing great.

297
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:29,721
Sorry.

298
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,761
He came up behind me,
slammed me into the wall, disabled me.

299
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,497
Did you see who it was?

300
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,199
He anticipated all my defense moves,

301
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,669
knew how to use the cuffs,
knew where I'd have my piece.

302
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,932
A cop?

303
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,634
Meeks.

304
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,744
Someone took the teddy bear
out of my office,

305
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,212
left it mutilated on my front stoop.

306
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,875
- What?
- He would've had access to it.

307
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,912
Phoebe, I promise you, I will find
the son of a bitch who did this to you.

308
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,923
Now, if it was Meeks, I'll make sure he pays.

309
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,089
I want you to take five days.

310
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,964
Now, let's pretend I said a week, you said
three, and we settled on five. Okay?

311
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,964
Liz, make sure she gets home.

312
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,500
Liz, I need somewhere to fall apart.
I can't do it at home.

313
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,203
You can go to my place.

314
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,440
I've got some family in town
but I'll get rid of them for the day.

315
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,745
No. No, no, no, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

316
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,939
How you doing?

317
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,488
Look, I'm sorry to have just
dumped this on you.

318
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,996
- I'm good to go.
- Will you stop?

319
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,089
This is the best third date I've ever been on.

320
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,997
Brought you some tea.

321
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,903
And my own little personal remedy
for black eyes.

322
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,367
I had to use it a few times myself.

323
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,844
Hey.

324
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,679
Where are you? Still here?

325
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,757
Yeah, it's just, I was thinking
about the last time I felt like this.

326
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,798
My dad was dead a couple of years.

327
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,401
And my mother had a restraining order
against her boyfriend.

328
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,735
He broke in one night with a shotgun.

329
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,037
Took my mother, my younger brother
and me hostage.

330
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:17,277
The cops came and Dave, my boss now,
was the negotiator.

331
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,213
And he talked him out?

332
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,684
Not exactly.

333
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,386
I put sleeping pills in his food.

334
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,517
How old were you?

335
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,819
Twelve.

336
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,792
Well, I hope they put that guy away
for a long time.

337
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,062
Yeah, he died in prison a few years ago.

338
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,769
You wanna tell me
what happened today, Phoebe?

339
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,544
I got jumped in the stairwell at work.

340
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,811
By who?

341
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,487
Someone who has a problem
with my authority.

342
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,283
Another cop did this to you?

343
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,385
Who?

344
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,056
I think I know,
but I don't have enough proof.

345
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,190
- Just give me his name.
- Hey, I'm the cop.

346
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,131
I'll do this my way.

347
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,775
Look, I got to get back to the house.

348
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,314
Are you gonna drive me home
or are you gonna make me walk?

349
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,059
- What happened to your face?
- Mom, Mom.

350
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,139
- What happened, Phoebe?
- Mom, I'm okay. It's okay, Mom.

351
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,399
- Look at your lip!
- I'm okay.

352
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,874
Mom, I can't have Carly down here.
Will you go check on her for me? Please?

353
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,707
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

354
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,441
- Please go check on her for me.
- Okay, I will but...

355
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,949
Thanks, Mom. It's okay. It's okay.

356
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,222
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

357
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,890
Thank you so much for today.

358
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,661
You have no idea how much it helped me,
on so many levels.

359
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,499
I can stay.

360
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,360
On the couch.

361
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,042
I'll be fine.

362
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,845
Call me if you need anything, okay?

363
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,346
- Okay.
- Okay.

364
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,080
Feel better.

365
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,883
- Thank you.
- Okay.

366
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,793
Mama, can I sleep with you tonight?

367
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,556
Of course you can, sweetheart. Come on.

368
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,593
Come under here.

369
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,533
- I like your PJs.
- I like yours.

370
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,105
Come here.

371
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,110
- Good night.
- Good night, Mommy.

372
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,709
The mechanic called.
He said he could bring the car by later.

373
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,218
The plumber can come Tuesday.

374
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,016
Thank God for Visa.

375
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,620
Duncan also called.

376
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,160
He said he wants to know how you're doing.

377
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,992
Can you tell me again
what happened to you?

378
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,701
Mommy fell running down the stairs,
sweetie.

379
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,564
- How?
- I wasn't paying attention.

380
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,105
Hey.

381
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,473
Wow.

382
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,480
You look like crap.

383
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,847
Thanks. You should've seen it
before the makeup.

384
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,589
- Those from him?
- Yeah.

385
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,819
And he made you tea.

386
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,797
God, it's like you found a dodo bird.
Men like him are extinct.

387
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,027
Yeah, I mean he's great, now.

388
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,169
But sooner or later they all start to bark?

389
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,899
We get to do our new jumps today.

390
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,444
Oh, you do?

391
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,615
Tell me you're arresting Arnie Meeks.

392
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,582
Let's go over what happened again.

393
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,847
Okay. I came in, dropped my stuff off.

394
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,083
I was late, so I was rushing.
Headed downstairs.

395
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,491
Did you stop anywhere, talk to anyone?

396
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,220
No.

397
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,922
Oh, yeah. Annie Utz.

398
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,762
She just kept talking,
babbling on and on and on.

399
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,200
What, like she was stalling you?

400
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:44,131
Annie, we brought you in to talk about
what happened to Lieutenant MacNamara.

401
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,107
I'm sorry she got hurt.

402
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,211
You were the last one to talk to her
before she was attacked.

403
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,508
Sorry.

404
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,711
I'm really not feeling good.

405
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,714
I think I might have to go home.

406
00:30:56,821 --> 00:31:00,154
Lieutenant MacNamara's
not feeling very well, either.

407
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,654
Someone jumped me in the stairwell,
assaulted me, and handcuffed me.

408
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,596
You kept talking to the Lieutenant
even after she said she'd be late.

409
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,061
You set her up, didn't you?

410
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,435
Annie, did you plan this with Meeks?

411
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,436
Annie, look at me!

412
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,977
Sorry.

413
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,948
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

414
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:30,913
He told me how you came onto him
and how he turned you down.

415
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,185
He said he would've filed charges
but you were sleeping with the Captain.

416
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,089
And you believed that?

417
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,929
I'm sorry.

418
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,666
He said he just needed
a few minutes to talk to you.

419
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,772
I'm so sorry.

420
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,837
My client stipulates that he
and Lieutenant MacNamara hold

421
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,179
opposing viewpoints, professional styles.

422
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,614
And that's hardly motive
for a physical attack on her person.

423
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,446
Now, the lack of evidence here...

424
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:05,044
You don't much like Lieutenant MacNamara,
do you, Arnie?

425
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,448
No.

426
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,889
Do you remember why you were
in her office last Thursday?

427
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,359
Of course I do.

428
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,327
She was covering her own ass
by suspending me

429
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,423
after she screwed up
that hostage negotiation.

430
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,438
First responder did not call for backup.

431
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,702
Officer Meeks antagonized the HT
with threats. Also...

432
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,970
Ask her who was on the phone with the HT
when he blew himself away.

433
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,670
Look, you need...

434
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,674
These are statements
from the other officers present at the scene.

435
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,913
How long have you been cheating
on your wife with Annie Utz?

436
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,855
She came onto me, I turned her down.
She's making this up.

437
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,793
Funny. 'Cause Annie said that
you told her I came onto you.

438
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,156
God, women just make your life a living hell.

439
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,429
In fact, I'm actively restraining myself
from coming onto you right now.

440
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,527
Keep it up, Detective,
and this interview is over.

441
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,165
What kind of man lies in wait
like a snake in the grass, huh?

442
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,675
You so afraid of her that
you had to jump her in the stairwell?

443
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,574
I was never in that stairwell.

444
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,169
Yes, you were.

445
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,512
You know, you could've raped me,

446
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,519
but I figured you knew you didn't have
what it takes to make an impression.

447
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,213
All right, this interview is over.

448
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,759
That's been a big problem in life for you,
hasn't it, Arnie?

449
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,193
You can't back it up with the goods,
on the street, in the bedroom,

450
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,528
or even in a stairwell where the only way
you could feel me up was to cuff me.

451
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,261
You're lucky I didn't break your neck!

452
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,472
Arnold Meeks, you're under arrest.

453
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,236
Look, you can't arrest him.
You provoked him into saying that.

454
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,708
Watch me.

455
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:40,878
Believe me, this isn't over.

456
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,350
Let's go.

457
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,536
Mom. Mom, it's okay.
Come on, let's go inside.

458
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,510
- Phoebe.
- Come on, come on, let's go inside.

459
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,772
I'm so sorry.

460
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,373
- Hey, don't apologize, okay?
- I'm so sorry.

461
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,783
Come on, let's sit down.
Come on. Come on, let's go.

462
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,358
- I'm useless.
- No.

463
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:29,025
You're hurt. We need groceries.

464
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,536
Well, Domino's delivers.

465
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,067
Come here. I'm okay.

466
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,898
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Mom.

467
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,306
I'm sorry.

468
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,435
Hey, don't say you're sorry, okay?

469
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,843
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:46,512
It's okay. It's okay.

471
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,785
What else?

472
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,122
Yogurt.

473
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,831
Next?

474
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,497
Eggs.

475
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,198
I didn't do it.

476
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,934
Someone's gonna call the cops on me.

477
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,843
Hey, I am the cops.

478
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,215
Oh, good. Yeah.

479
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,285
- You're safe.
- Thank you.

480
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,819
Listen, I just... It doesn't...

481
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,317
What's next?

482
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,120
What's the matter?

483
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,493
Nothing, I'm fine.
What was after eggs, though?

484
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,499
- Wait, who is that?
- It's no one. It's no one.

485
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,399
No, that's him, isn't
it? Why isn't he in jail?

486
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,495
- It's called bail. Duncan, let it go.
- It's called bail?

487
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,868
- Hey. Hey.
- Duncan!

488
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,373
Hey, make you feel like a big guy
to jump on a woman?

489
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,464
Duncan!

490
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,874
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay, buddy, you can't touch me. I'm a cop.

491
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,844
- Yeah, I wanna do a lot more...
- Hey Duncan, can you stop it?

492
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:50,936
- Oh, do you?
- Stop it!

493
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,379
- You're a cop? All I see you got is a badge.
- Duncan!

494
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,610
MacNamara, control your boy.

495
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,420
Let it go.

496
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,580
If you don't let it go,
I'm gonna walk out of here right now.

497
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,454
It's a good decision.

498
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,197
Were you out of your mind?
Do you know what you could've done?

499
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,428
What? Look, I don't care if he's a cop.

500
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,199
- I don't care if you're a cop.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

501
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,366
He hasn't been tried yet. Do you know
how you could've screwed that up?

502
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,205
And how do you think
this is gonna make me look?

503
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,903
- It's gonna be all over the office.
- I'm sorry.

504
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,947
You just undermined me in ways
you can't even imagine.

505
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,482
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?
I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry.

506
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,347
Yeah, no kidding.

507
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,560
Officer, let's lock down this block.

508
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,936
- It's a hell of a first day back.
- Better than doing paperwork.

509
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,568
- You sure you're ready for this?
- What do we got?

510
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:58,274
We got four hostages
in an abandoned diner across the street.

511
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:02,284
HT's name is Charles Jackson,
street name Razz.

512
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,753
- Gang kid?
- Yup.

513
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,483
One of the hostages got out the back.

514
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,519
He says the HT is a 16-year-old
I-70 wannabe.

515
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,361
Blood Eight shoots his older brother,
who's also a gang member.

516
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:20,096
HT goes looking for the shooter
in one of their hangouts to get revenge.

517
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:25,073
He surprises them. Target's not there.
Kid shoots the place up and takes hostages.

518
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,473
- He got family?
- Yeah.

519
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,478
Mother's at the hospital with the brother
as we speak.

520
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,605
He's in serious but stable condition.

521
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,378
We sent somebody over to pick her up,
she's on her way now.

522
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,113
We've got two snipers in position,
Sierra One and Four.

523
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:39,155
Second floor upstairs.

524
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,554
Can they get a visual?

525
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,683
Window's too mucked up.
They can't take him out.

526
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,090
So what's this kid's play?

527
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,720
Well, he wants us to find the guy
he thinks shot his brother.

528
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,561
We send the shooter in,
he sends the hostages out.

529
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,158
He's got a sheet. Just petty stuff.

530
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,794
God, he's a baby.

531
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:57,135
- What about the kid who shot his brother?
- Jerome "Clip" Sagget.

532
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:01,200
Not a baby, a real bad- ass.
He's gone under and nobody's talking.

533
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,177
Okay, let's get going.
Liz, you're my secondary.

534
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,441
- Okay.
- Is his phone locked down?

535
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,606
Yes.

536
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:16,454
You got him yet?

537
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,757
Razz, this is Phoebe MacNamara,
police negotiator.

538
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,788
Is anyone hurt in there?

539
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,993
They will be,
you don't get me Clip in 10 minutes!

540
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:27,627
Okay, we're working on it
but we're gonna need some more time.

541
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,172
Ten minutes. Then I shoot someone.

542
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,133
Okay, Razz, don't get upset.
Everything's gonna work out.

543
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,611
Nothing's gonna work out
until I put a bullet in Clip!

544
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,650
What if I find out how Puppet's doing?

545
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,486
Is he okay? They still working on him?

546
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,618
I can call a doctor for you
but you're gonna have to give me more time.

547
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,162
What you got?

548
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,062
A half hour. You tell me what he says.

549
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,403
And you get me Clip!

550
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,432
Good work.

551
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,140
My boys come from a good family.

552
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,310
They went to good schools.

553
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,186
And still...

554
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:22,316
Mrs. Jackson, is there anything that you can
tell me about Charles that would help me?

555
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,826
Is there anything he responds to?

556
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,457
If there is, I haven't found it.

557
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,664
Okay, listen to me.

558
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,431
No matter what you hear me say to your son,

559
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,507
I want you to know that I'm doing my best
to bring him out alive.

560
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,269
Do you trust me?

561
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,475
- You have kids?
- I have a daughter.

562
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,737
I trust you.

563
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,922
Razz, I've got good news.

564
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,963
We have Clip in custody.

565
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,501
You bring him to me.

566
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,662
He had a gun on him, same caliber
as the one that shot your brother.

567
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:12,300
We're testing it. If it matches,
Clip's going away for a long, long time.

568
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,203
That's not enough!

569
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,242
Razz, Clip was hiding, hiding like a punk.

570
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:27,313
His rep's gone. You can kill him,
but prison's gonna be a lot worse.

571
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,121
He's never gonna know when it's coming.

572
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,493
Clip was hiding?

573
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,856
I wanna see him.

574
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,956
I wanna see him locked up!

575
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,236
You a tough guy, huh? Tough guy, huh?

576
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,240
I can bring you to him.

577
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,178
You better not be lying to me, bitch.

578
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,186
You got my word, Razz.

579
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,513
Okay. I'm coming out.

580
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:03,987
Then you're gonna take me to see him.

581
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,132
Okay, Razz, here's what you're gonna do.

582
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,228
You're gonna open the door slowly,
slide the gun out onto the ground,

583
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,500
then put your hands up, okay?

584
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,873
I have a shot. Do I have a green light?

585
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,538
No. Stand down.

586
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,318
Shots fired! Get back!

587
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,844
- What the hell?
- Stand down!

588
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,214
- He shot my little boy!
- Stand down!

589
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,219
Charles!

590
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,921
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

591
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,829
We gotta go.

592
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:39,680
Hey.

593
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,316
- Hey.
- How you holding up?

594
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,790
Okay.

595
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,801
Casings we found
in the shooter's apartment were.223's.

596
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,166
Our boys were using.308's.

597
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,704
Somebody got through the police line.

598
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,400
Yeah, I didn't think it was one of us.

599
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,809
What?

600
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,907
Meeks cut a deal.

601
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,954
Okay, what kind of deal?

602
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,823
He's off the job. No benefits.

603
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,890
He pleads to assault, he gets probation.

604
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,456
And what, he has to write
on the blackboard 100 times,

605
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,862
"I promise to be a good boy"?

606
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,427
His dad is a captain in Narcotics, Phoebe.
The brass wants this put away.

607
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,904
Yeah, I'm sure there was
only so much you could do.

608
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,976
Phoebe, he assaulted you in my house.

609
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,037
You think I didn't fight them on this?

610
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,445
Sounds to me like you were
the one who cut the deal.

611
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,475
- Duncan.
- Happy Halloween.

612
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,808
Hi, Carly.

613
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,299
Ready? See, that doesn't...

614
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,067
We gotta dig in there
and get it with our hands.

615
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,540
Isn't that great? Get it all out.

616
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,004
- There's no room for the two of us in here.
- I've got more goop than you.

617
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,980
- Wait a minute.
- No, wave to Mommy.

618
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,609
- Hi. Say, "Hi, Mommy."
- "Hi, Mommy."

619
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,582
We're carving pumpkins for Halloween.

620
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,548
Look at mine.

621
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,020
- Look at mine.
- Yeah, it looks great.

622
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,554
Ready? Go, go, go.

623
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

624
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:18,641
You remember how you told me
to let go every now and then?

625
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,676
Yeah.

626
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,245
I shot my car.

627
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:40,362
That's not really what I had in mind.

628
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,508
Sixteen- year- old boy died in my arms today.

629
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,812
Promised his mother I'd get him out alive.

630
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,342
Didn't.

631
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:58,855
This is my life, Duncan.

632
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,687
Are you sure you wanna be a part of it?

633
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,006
Did you tell her any of the stories
about when you and Phin were kids?

634
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,170
No. And we're not going to, remember?

635
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,975
They got in so much trouble.

636
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,107
- I'm serious.
- Oh, come on.

637
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,285
So, as the best friend,
I have a very important question for you.

638
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,521
Okay.

639
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,960
Are you packing right now?

640
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,690
- Phin.
- What?

641
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,790
Please ignore my husband.

642
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,301
"Do you have a gun in an ankle holster?"
seems to me

643
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,566
to be a legitimate question
to ask a house guest.

644
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,840
A lady never divulges her secrets.

645
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,276
See that? Girl's got manners.

646
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,945
So then, what is she doing with Duncan?

647
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,812
The best to you.

648
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,916
Duncan's brought girls around before.

649
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,825
But he's never brought one around
for my approval.

650
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,688
How am I doing?

651
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,091
Depends on your plans for him.

652
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,692
What exactly are you worried about?

653
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,131
I'm not in it for the money.

654
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,765
She read you pretty fast.

655
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:30,170
Actually, I think what Ma Bee's trying to say
is, "If you toy with him,

656
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,474
"we'll hunt you down."

657
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,380
Do I seem like the kind of girl who toys?

658
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,755
Hey.

659
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,690
Hey, sweetie.

660
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,826
- That looks really pretty.
- Thank you.

661
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,966
What are all the spots on him?

662
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,370
He's got hearts and butterflies.

663
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,506
- He got the chickenpox.
- What?

664
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,295
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, how are you guys?

665
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,031
Yeah, we're fine.
Listen, if this is about the check,

666
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,568
I could really use it right now.
The house is...

667
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,002
- Yeah, it's not about that.
- What?

668
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,132
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know
I'm engaged.

669
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,107
You're getting married.

670
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,479
Well, congratulations.

671
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,375
What's wrong?
Your tone sounds kind of funny.

672
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,849
No, Roy, my tone's not funny.

673
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,852
It's like you're not happy for me
or something.

674
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,478
So, you wanna talk to Carly?

675
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,490
You know what?
I gotta run, but I'll call you back later, okay?

676
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,117
Right. But of course. Okay. Bye.

677
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,145
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

678
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:17,544
Hey Duncan, it's Phoebe.
Listen, I can't do today.

679
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:18,985
Something came up.

680
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,990
But I will call you later. Okay. Bye.

681
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,115
Liz. I need you to come over here.

682
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,586
- Here.
- Thanks.

683
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:29,684
So you deal with crime scenes
on a weekly basis,

684
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,919
but you're scared of a snake.

685
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,895
Its head is bashed in.

686
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,696
So first the teddy bear, now this?

687
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,707
Think it could be Meeks?

688
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,436
I don't know.

689
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,671
Don't underestimate his ego.

690
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:53,181
Didn't you have a lunch date with Duncan?

691
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,978
Yeah, I canceled.

692
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:56,877
Why?

693
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,088
Roy called this morning.
He's getting remarried.

694
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,589
Who gets the sympathy card?

695
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,493
So what? You think Duncan's gonna
crush your heart

696
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,464
and stomp all over it like Roy did?

697
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,094
- Doesn't strike me as the type.
- Well, Roy didn't strike me as the type either.

698
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,866
You were young and stupid.

699
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:20,101
And he was really stupid. Still is.

700
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,142
It's him.

701
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:33,012
Duncan. Hey, Detective Liz Alberta.
Listen, Phoebe knows she canceled,

702
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,421
but she just realized she hasn't had sex
for over a year.

703
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,323
So if it's okay with
you, she'll be right over.

704
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,486
Okay.

705
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:44,525
- Break a leg.
- Oh, my God! God, you are so fired!

706
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,264
- Come on, Phoebs.
- How could you do that?

707
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,634
- I gotta live through someone.
- Oh, my God.

708
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,001
Hey.

709
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,306
Sorry I canceled.

710
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,632
It's a nice place.

711
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,498
Hard to appreciate last time I was here.

712
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,599
I was gonna build a place for my mom.

713
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,738
And she said if I really loved her

714
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,177
I'd buy her a place in Vegas
and stake her 50 grand.

715
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,111
So I built this for myself.

716
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,252
What about your dad?

717
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:50,992
He left when I was 10.

718
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,762
No wonder you get Carly.

719
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,673
Whatever happens with us,

720
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,136
will you do me a favor
and let her down easy?

721
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,076
You mean let you down easy?

722
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,279
Hey.

723
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,456
I'm not going anywhere.

724
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,870
- Phoebe, it's Dave.
- Hey, Dave.

725
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,778
- We got a situation at the cemetery.
- What?

726
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,885
Rolling Hills Cemetery?

727
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,685
For me specifically?

728
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,958
- I'll take you.
- No, I'll get myself there.

729
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,874
Hey, Dave. What's the deal?

730
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,951
We have a collar bomb
with a clock connected to it.

731
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,316
The bomb squad says it's live.

732
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,585
Our victim was ordered to call 911
and ask for you directly, by name.

733
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,585
He's wearing an ear bud,
he's wearing a microphone.

734
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:33,128
He says the guy who did this
can hear everything.

735
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:36,357
- We got a name?
- Says he can only give it to you.

736
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,094
- What's the radius of a collar bomb?
- It's limited.

737
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:42,194
- It's designed to...
- Blow his head off. Gotcha.

738
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:43,772
Stay with her.

739
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,498
Sir? Phoebe MacNamara.

740
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,102
Roy!

741
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,446
Phoebe, help me, please.

742
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,543
Okay, check on my family.
Get a cop on the door.

743
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,878
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

744
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,510
I need a car dispatched to 231 Magnolia.

745
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:34,920
Make sure the cop stays on the door
till they hear from me.

746
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,288
Roy, I'm gonna need you to calm down,
okay?

747
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,361
He's gonna kill me.

748
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,554
- Who is?
- I don't know.

749
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:43,393
Somebody put a gun to my head
and threw me in the trunk of my car.

750
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,128
- What kind of car is it?
- Audi A4.

751
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:47,736
- We're looking for an Audi A4.
- Standby.

752
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,963
What's the plate number?

753
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,937
Jesus, I don't know,
just get this thing off of me!

754
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,235
Roy, stop your whimpering.

755
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,242
Wait, wait.

756
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,611
He's talking to me.

757
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:01,081
You repeat everything that I say to you.

758
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,178
He wants me to say what he's saying.

759
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,817
Phoebe, you little bitch,

760
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:12,483
you cost me. And now I'm gonna cost you.

761
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,929
Phoebe, you bitch, you cost me
and now I cost you.

762
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,532
What did I cost you?

763
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,700
You'll remember soon enough.

764
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,741
Can you give me a name,
something I can call you?

765
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:31,313
Yeah, sure. You can call me Cooper.

766
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,712
Sure, you can call me Cooper.

767
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:39,019
Do you actually care about
this worthless piece of crap?

768
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,613
Do you really care about
this worthless piece of crap?

769
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,557
I don't wanna see him or anyone else
get hurt, okay?

770
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,526
Now you haven't hurt anyone yet, Cooper.

771
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,897
You tell that to Charles Jackson.

772
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:52,160
Tell that to Charles Jackson.

773
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,929
You shot Charles Jackson?

774
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,301
You worked so hard to save him.

775
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,808
You worked so hard to save him.

776
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,206
Is there someone else I didn't save?

777
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,142
Are the roses for her?

778
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,082
Figure it out, Phoebe.
Maybe you'll save yourself.

779
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:12,010
Figure it out, Phoebe
and maybe you'll save yourself.

780
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,652
Time's up. Goodbye, Phoebe.

781
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,024
See ya soon.

782
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,327
- What? No! No!
- No, Cooper, wait!

783
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,795
No, please!

784
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,992
Bring Meeks in first thing in the morning.

785
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,293
Fine, but this isn't Meeks.

786
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,595
It's about an old case,
someone who didn't make it out alive.

787
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:03,138
Okay, look. Why don't you leave this
with me tonight, get some sleep.

788
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,141
- I'll talk to these guys, have 'em stay. Okay?
- Thanks.

789
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,574
What's happening? What's going on?

790
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,771
I gotta go to the office.
You need police protection.

791
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,507
You're gonna go into the office now?

792
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:15,778
- Yeah, I gotta go through my files.
- You can do that in the morning.

793
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:19,082
I could, but I'm just gonna do it now.
I'll get the cops to escort you home.

794
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,952
I'm not going home
and I don't need a police escort, either.

795
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,923
He wired your car.

796
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:28,563
And right now you need to stay
as far away from me as possible.

797
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:33,993
So either you let me put the cops on you
or I'm gonna put you in protective custody.

798
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,090
Phoebe MacNamara.

799
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,195
- Hiya, Phoebe.
- Cooper?

800
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:10,761
Good thing your boyfriend didn't
stay in the car, huh?

801
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,540
Why don't we get together, Cooper,
just you and me?

802
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,376
I didn't see your little girl getting
ready to go off to school this morning.

803
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,416
Hope she's feeling okay.

804
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:26,188
Did it make you feel good
to put a dead snake outside my house?

805
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,722
And the bear?

806
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,892
You know, actually,
the bear was your friend Meeks.

807
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,962
It was just a nice coincidence.

808
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:37,555
Why don't you just tell me
who she was, who I didn't save.

809
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:40,261
And ruin all the fun? I don't think so.

810
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,996
You know, I could've taken out
you and your boyfriend

811
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,733
on the Ferris wheel the other night.

812
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,365
I had the shot.

813
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,303
I think next time,
I'll give myself the green light on that.

814
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,777
Bye for now.

815
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:56,607
Hey, did you get that?

816
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:01,213
Sorry, Lieutenant. We recorded the call,
but we just didn't get the trace.

817
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,589
- You wanted to see this?
- Yeah. Thanks.

818
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:11,997
Our boys said the car bomb was
detonated by cell phone.

819
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,969
The leads to Roy weren't even hot.
The C4 was children's clay.

820
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,572
Hey, this is that apartment
where Razz was shot from.

821
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:23,905
Is this clock here in Evidence?

822
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,503
It would've been brought in
for fingerprinting.

823
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:27,583
Can you grab that for me?

824
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,145
This is the clock from the apartment
where Cooper shot Razz.

825
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,781
No prints. Hands frozen at noon.
No batteries.

826
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:41,589
This one from the cemetery was at 11:57 a. m.
when I started talking to Roy.

827
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,598
Real time was actually like 3:00 p.m.

828
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,327
It hasn't stopped.

829
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,666
It's three hours earlier.

830
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,704
So he's sending us a message,
but why noon?

831
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:53,640
Okay, he kills Razz, he blows up the car.
What else do we know?

832
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:57,270
He's looking for revenge.
Someone he was close to I didn't save.

833
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,677
Give me the specifics.

834
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,306
He's been tracking me.
He followed Duncan and I to the park.

835
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,543
He's been watching the house.

836
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,745
Put the snake on the porch.

837
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:06,616
What?

838
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,955
No, the night Duncan dropped me home,
I thought I saw someone across the street.

839
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,652
Seemed like he was watching the house.

840
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,320
Then I realized he was walking a dog.

841
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,456
I looked outside
'cause I heard him whistling.

842
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,571
That's the tune he was whistling?

843
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,110
Yeah.

844
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,578
That's the theme from High Noon.

845
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:33,072
High Noon?

846
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:34,877
You're kidding.

847
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,576
My God, I am old.

848
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,648
It's a classic western,

849
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,213
obviously made before your time,
starring Gary Cooper.

850
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,485
Cooper?

851
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:47,253
Cooper, noon, shootout. What else?

852
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,093
In his call to me, he said, "I had the shot.

853
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,498
"Next time, I'll give myself the green light
on that." That's cop talk.

854
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,572
If he's a cop, that would totally explain
how he'd breached the perimeter

855
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:59,539
on the Charles Jackson case.
Could've been in uniform.

856
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:03,942
Captain, Lieutenant, we found Roy's Audi
at the long- term parking at the airport,

857
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,911
but it was wiped clean.

858
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:10,077
So he leaves his car in long- term parking,

859
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:13,913
rents a car one way or takes a plane
to Roy's house in Rockville.

860
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,787
Good. Bull, look into one- way tickets

861
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,260
and car rentals with
a drop- off in Montgomery County.

862
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,220
- Liz.
- Yeah?

863
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:25,562
You're with Phoebe on this 24- 7.
Let's get to work.

864
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,862
Philippa Delray.

865
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,767
Carjackers killed her,
took her 5 year old daughter hostage.

866
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:31,840
They surrendered, the girl was unharmed.

867
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:35,877
Philippa's brother, Ray Sanchez, was in
the army at the time, weapons specialist.

868
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,775
Now he's a cop in Vice.

869
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,041
Let's see if he was off duty.

870
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:49,321
He was in Central Booking that night
with a prisoner.

871
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,853
Angela Brentine.

872
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,628
She was injured
when armed robbers took over a bank.

873
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,427
Negotiation took four hours.

874
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,866
She bled out inside the bank
before I could get her out.

875
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,961
Husband's Joshua Brentine.

876
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,900
The real estate developer?

877
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,205
Wasn't there a rumor
he had a honey on the side?

878
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,109
Teller's witness statement
said she was there

879
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:14,741
to withdraw all her money
from one account and close it.

880
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:19,815
Husband's statement says
he didn't know about that account.

881
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:24,518
So if you were married to a really rich guy,
why would you have a secret bank account?

882
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,187
In case the really rich guy dumps me.

883
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:30,163
Maybe she knew about
the honey on the side.

884
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:33,235
Yeah, but if he's having an affair,

885
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,967
wouldn't he be happy the wife's dead
and out of the way?

886
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,007
Why hold it against you?

887
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,534
Look at this. No ring.

888
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:47,406
So? She was getting it sized
or cleaned or she didn't wear a ring.

889
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,546
Or maybe she was having an affair, too.

890
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,621
So the secret bank account's
in case she wants to dump him.

891
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,490
Except even if that's true,
Brentine's still not that upset she's dead.

892
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,892
No, but her lover would've been.

893
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:03,363
Her wedding would've made the papers,
right?

894
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:06,765
Maid of honor. Best friend. That's good.

895
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,330
- I'll look up the wedding announcement.
- Thanks, Liz.

896
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,632
We worked together. We had this concept.

897
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:16,405
She specialized in weddings
and I did screaming, crying kids.

898
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,106
Fun way to generate repeat business.

899
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,239
What was her husband like?

900
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:23,341
Controlling, annoying,
miserable human being.

901
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,047
They weren't going anywhere.
She wanted kids and he didn't.

902
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,556
- Is that why she had the affair?
- The affair.

903
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,527
Look, Angela was so into romance,
the roses, the jewelry.

904
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,160
And this guy, he played it to the max.

905
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,200
She said he even wanted
to pick out names for their kids.

906
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:43,762
Angela never had a sister,
so she wanted two girls, Mabel and Vivian.

907
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,001
- You didn't like him?
- Actually, I never met him.

908
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,168
Didn't even know his name.

909
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,873
She was very private about him,
didn't want her husband to find out.

910
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,473
I know he bought her jewelry from Mark D's.

911
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:59,076
They weren't big items,
but they sent her over the moon.

912
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:03,521
Glynis, do you know
why she was in the bank that day?

913
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,322
I think they were planning on running away.

914
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,398
She came in the day before she died

915
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,093
and she said that she wanted
to cash out of the business.

916
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:14,465
You know where
they were planning on going?

917
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,801
She said they always wanted to buy
a ranch in Wyoming, call it Camelot.

918
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,467
I figured that's where they were going.

919
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,272
- Do you still have any of her cameras?
- Oh, I have one.

920
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,212
But if you're looking for any pictures
on the memory card, there aren't any.

921
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,613
She was a Nazi about uploading.

922
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:32,611
Liz.

923
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:37,988
She used to paint little pink rosebuds
on the bottom of all of her equipments.

924
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,619
He sent her pink roses every Monday.

925
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,588
Can you excuse me?
If I don't get this shot in the next ten,

926
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:47,157
- there's gonna be a nuclear meltdown.
- Sure. Thank you.

927
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,797
There were pink roses all around
the grave where Roy was.

928
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,300
This is our guy.

929
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:20,758
Hello.

930
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,040
- Hey.
- Hey.

931
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,940
There was a tripwire on the door,
set on a five- second delay.

932
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,446
His neighbor said he stepped back to help
her with her groceries and boom, it went off.

933
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,606
Saved his life.

934
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,946
I want two officers
outside ICU at all times.

935
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,747
Already done. 203.

936
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,011
I saw him.

937
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:08,841
Dave?

938
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:11,677
Dave.

939
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,387
What happened?

940
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,984
Cooper. He rigged your front door.

941
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,429
I saw him.

942
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,501
He wanted me to see him.

943
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:30,932
- Phoebe, he's a cop.
- You know him?

944
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,934
Yeah, he was SWAT.

945
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:36,170
Walker.

946
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,302
No.

947
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,739
Walken. Walken.

948
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:44,653
Name's Jerald Dennis Walken.
SWAT sniper. And get this.

949
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:48,450
He was set up outside the bank
the day Angela was killed.

950
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:52,516
He was waiting outside while I negotiated.
He couldn't do anything.

951
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,997
He moved out of his place a few days after
he quit the department. No forwarding info.

952
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:58,760
What about Wyoming?
Angela's friend said...

953
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,395
I checked. There's no ranches
listed in his name, none called Camelot.

954
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:04,063
- What about his credit cards?
- Canceled.

955
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:06,971
At least the ones we know about.
Bank accounts, too.

956
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:08,168
Sold his pickup truck,

957
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:12,179
and also registered to him are
a 9 mm, a.32 and a hunting rifle.

958
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:13,339
Friends, family?

959
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,849
No family.
His friends haven't seen him since he quit.

960
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,249
He just disappeared off the map.

961
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,850
We've got the entire department
out there looking for him.

962
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,982
Let you know as soon
as we hear something, okay?

963
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,560
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

964
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:37,705
- Hello.
- Hey, Duncan, it's Phoebe.

965
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:41,167
Hey, I'm just checking in.

966
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,643
So, something happened with Dave.

967
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,113
Yeah, I know.

968
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,184
Is he gonna be all right?

969
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,086
Yeah, he's gonna be okay.

970
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,286
Good.

971
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,230
You've been here this whole time?

972
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,337
I hired Suicide Joe back.

973
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:22,584
It seemed like the right thing to do.
He's in therapy.

974
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,816
What? What are you thinking?

975
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,556
How glad I am that I found you.

976
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,798
You know what we need
when this is all over?

977
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,100
What?

978
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:46,538
A vacation.

979
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,836
- A vacation?
- Yes, a vacation.

980
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,405
Where?

981
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:53,704
Disney World.

982
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:58,651
Now that the psycho killer is caught,

983
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,348
Phoebe and Duncan are
going to Disney World.

984
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,822
And Carly.

985
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:07,028
- Carly would love Disney World.
- You wanna take Carly to Disney World?

986
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:10,155
Maybe just Carly, now that I think about it.

987
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:22,103
Duncan.

988
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:27,041
Will you marry me?

989
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,684
Where's the ring?

990
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,726
You don't have a ring?

991
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:43,863
What kind of half- assed proposal is
this if you don't even have a ring?

992
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,934
Well, been kind of busy.

993
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,631
Yeah? I was gonna propose to you
at Disney World, but I would've had a ring.

994
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,508
Is that a yes?

995
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,144
Yes.

996
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,194
- Hello.
- Hi.

997
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,468
To what do I owe the honor
of a 10:00 a.m. phone call?

998
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,971
Just wanted to see
if you had any plans for lunch.

999
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,905
Well, I'm having lunch with Loo.

1000
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,476
All right.

1001
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,269
I guess you won't wanna help me
pick out a ring for Phoebe then, huh?

1002
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:34,144
I can reschedule.

1003
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,409
Yeah, I know my wallet's gonna regret this,

1004
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,486
but bring Loo, too, okay?

1005
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:40,487
Okay. Where're we doing this?

1006
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,817
Mark D's.

1007
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:45,091
What, did you win the lottery or something?

1008
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,954
- How's noon?
- That works. Hey, Duncan,

1009
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,926
you done good.

1010
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,901
I know. Believe me, I know.

1011
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,864
Any progress finding him?

1012
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:04,139
He knows you saw him.
So he's got two options, cut and run

1013
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,406
or finish this.

1014
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,482
He's gonna finish it.

1015
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,716
Are you ready for that?

1016
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,378
Hey, Captain. Lieutenant.

1017
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:15,286
Airport Budget said they rented
a car to a Samuel Grimes,

1018
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,655
one- way with a drop- off in Middletown.

1019
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,593
Here. Got a copy of the driver's license.

1020
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,900
That's him.

1021
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,031
Darker hair and glasses, but that's him.

1022
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,837
- Address in Nevada?
- Yeah, but he paid with a Visa.

1023
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,275
We've got a billing address
down on Tybee Avenue.

1024
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:41,281
That's too easy. Why not just pay cash?
He knows we're gonna find this address.

1025
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,351
He wants you to go there.

1026
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,781
Phoebe, be careful.

1027
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,983
Toothbrush and razor are still there.
He's not running.

1028
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,150
No, but it doesn't mean he's coming back.

1029
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,353
You're gonna wanna see this.

1030
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,564
Holy crap.

1031
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:22,079
It's real time.

1032
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,951
Phoebe.

1033
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,854
Timing mechanism.

1034
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,429
No weapons.

1035
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,639
No photos. Memory card's empty.

1036
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,245
I think he's done here.
He knew we'd find this place.

1037
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,508
Question is, where is he now?

1038
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:53,048
Why photos of these locations?

1039
01:14:58,727 --> 01:14:59,785
Look.

1040
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:03,256
Same photos on the laptop, same order.

1041
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,766
Except these ones aren't up there.

1042
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:10,966
And if he took them with him, they must
mean something, they must have a purpose.

1043
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,631
They're targets.

1044
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,306
Think he's giving himself the go?

1045
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,775
Yeah, I do.

1046
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:19,611
And it's gonna be today at noon.

1047
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,911
Question is, where.

1048
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,785
- Maybe it's the bank.
- Too obvious.

1049
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,918
Look. It's that jewelry store, Mark D's.

1050
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,284
It's not up there, either.

1051
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,123
Yeah, it's romantic,
it sure as hell makes a statement,

1052
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,629
and Angela's friend said he bought her
jewelry from there.

1053
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:40,168
He's got a $3,000 charge from there
the month before Angela died.

1054
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,032
That is a big item.

1055
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:45,629
That's it. He proposed. Or he was going to.

1056
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:50,268
Got 23 minutes.

1057
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:58,987
We're early.

1058
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:02,545
Okay. That means we can take
a couple laps before he gets here

1059
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,647
and check out the good stuff.

1060
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,386
- May I help you, ladies?
- Oh, yes.

1061
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:09,396
Yes, please. I was thinking of
a gold- beaded pendant with diamonds.

1062
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,466
Engagement rings, please.

1063
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:17,400
Excuse me. Would you give me a moment?

1064
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:18,632
Kevin.

1065
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,541
Sorry. Engagement ring, right?

1066
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,635
You've got to take the deliveries
around back.

1067
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,808
I'll tell you what.

1068
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,517
You!

1069
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:32,143
- I didn't touch it.
- No?

1070
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,347
Do it. Hit the alarm! Do it!

1071
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:40,260
I want everyone to move to the back
of the store now. Everyone, move it.

1072
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,057
Right there. Right there.

1073
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,461
Now get on the floor.

1074
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,363
Not you.
You, you move over here, right now. Now.

1075
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:48,459
Now get down. Get down, right now.

1076
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,061
Down. Empty your pockets and your purses.

1077
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,162
Turn them inside out.

1078
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,471
I want you to put the contents
on the floor in front of you, now.

1079
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:59,274
Anyone reaches for a cell phone
or a weapon and this woman gets it.

1080
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:02,316
Am I perfectly clear on that? Good.

1081
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,181
You. Stand up. Stand up now!

1082
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,847
If you hesitate again,
I will blow your head off.

1083
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,083
Turn the alarm off. Do it.

1084
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,419
Pick up the phone.

1085
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,258
Dial 911.

1086
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,830
This call came in four minutes ago,
Lieutenant.

1087
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,097
This is Mark D.

1088
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:26,697
There's an armed man holding me
and seven other people hostage in my store.

1089
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,241
He has guns and explosives.

1090
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,574
He says if he doesn't receive a phone call
from Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara

1091
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,547
by noon, he will shoot one of the hostages.

1092
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:39,810
Take the alley.

1093
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,863
Lieutenant, we're set up in here.

1094
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,501
- Go, go, go!
- Let's go.

1095
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:56,332
Get all your men to keep those people back.

1096
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,445
We don't have his phone locked down yet.

1097
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,177
What's the number?

1098
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,514
Patch her line through the call box
as soon as you can.

1099
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,302
Answer it.

1100
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,307
Let me speak to the hostage taker.

1101
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,810
It's for you.

1102
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:41,480
Bring it here.

1103
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:48,081
Jerry. How's everyone doing in there?

1104
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,718
You know who I am.

1105
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,252
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

1106
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:58,196
Everyone's fine.

1107
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,236
Except maybe the security guard.

1108
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:04,669
You see, he's got on a new jacket,

1109
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:08,607
and I don't think he likes it very much.

1110
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,773
Are you saying you have explosives
strapped to the security guard?

1111
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,676
God, you're quick, Phoebe.

1112
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,423
Why don't we start with you releasing
some of the hostages?

1113
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:23,491
No.

1114
01:19:24,392 --> 01:19:27,225
We'll start with the SWAT team
that have their rifles trained on me.

1115
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:30,355
- You know the procedure.
- I sure as hell do, Lieutenant.

1116
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:34,367
You get them to stand down right now
or I will shoot a hostage.

1117
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:37,737
Get back to me in five.

1118
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:43,234
Bravo 1, 2, 3, stand down.

1119
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,304
Stand down.

1120
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,039
Okay. I'm coming.

1121
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,283
We got a partial visual, Lieutenant,
from the Sierra Team

1122
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,410
on the second floor, adjacent building.

1123
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,455
Five or six hostages.

1124
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,525
Looks like there's a device
rigged to the rear door. What's our play?

1125
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:01,357
- The other snipers in position?
- Two others, but they don't have a shot.

1126
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,397
We have the green light?

1127
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,662
He's gonna take himself and them with him.

1128
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:08,599
- Phoebe, Phoebe. Phoebe.
- Duncan.

1129
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,728
He knows two of the hostages.

1130
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,603
- Ma Bee and Loo are in there.
- What? Are you sure?

1131
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:17,109
They were supposed to meet me at noon.
I parked behind Loo's car.

1132
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:18,907
They're smart women.
They won't do anything stupid.

1133
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,072
What if he knows who they are?

1134
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,844
There's no way he knew they were in there.
And he's not focusing on them.

1135
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:26,978
You can get them out, right?
Right? Get him to let the women out?

1136
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,649
Right?

1137
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,857
Look, I need you to wait outside.

1138
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,656
I gotta do my job.

1139
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:37,192
Come on.

1140
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:01,314
Yeah.

1141
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,453
Is everyone okay in there?

1142
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,458
Everyone's perfect, Lieutenant.

1143
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,586
No one's laying on the floor
bleeding out because of you.

1144
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,664
Not yet.

1145
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,900
Is there anything I can get for you,
or anyone else in there?

1146
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,298
You know I could've put that bomb
in your car.

1147
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:20,840
I thought about it.

1148
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,409
Why didn't you?

1149
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:27,209
Because then you wouldn't be here
talking with me right now, you stupid bitch.

1150
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:31,342
Okay, look, what can I do to help
resolve this situation, Jerry?

1151
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,889
Stick your gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger, that's what.

1152
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,356
I thought you wanted
to talk this through with me.

1153
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:41,589
I know you have things to say to me.
I'm here to listen to you.

1154
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,926
Or do you wanna talk to someone else?

1155
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:45,397
You let her die.

1156
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,992
I had the kill shot.
All you had to do was green light.

1157
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,639
I know you blame me for Angela's death.

1158
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,470
I know how you feel.

1159
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:57,275
But we didn't know Angela was hurt
in the first hour.

1160
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:59,006
You should have.

1161
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,183
He's still in the northeast corner
of the store, here.

1162
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,755
We don't have a shot unless he moves.

1163
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,346
And then we're shooting through
half- inch glass,

1164
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,947
and that'll affect the trajectory.

1165
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:12,686
- We could hit a hostage.
- Yeah.

1166
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:16,286
We need one shot to take out the glass,
the other the HT.

1167
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:18,662
My explosive guys have looked
at that rig at the rear door.

1168
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,600
They think they can defuse it
and circumvent the alarm.

1169
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:24,399
- But they don't know.
- Pretty damn sure.

1170
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,501
I'll give you an hour,

1171
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:31,045
then I'm gonna let the bomb squad
take that rig and go through the rear door.

1172
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:03,742
It's been over an hour
and there's been very little movement.

1173
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:07,144
We understand there are
at least seven hostages in the store.

1174
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:09,876
Mark D's is a high- end jewelry store

1175
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,113
here in one of the city's most trendy
shopping districts.

1176
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:20,420
Jerry?

1177
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:23,795
Not much fun just waiting, is it?

1178
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,969
There's absolutely nothing that you can do.

1179
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,697
Have you thought about what you want?

1180
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:33,239
$10 million.

1181
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:39,613
Okay, I can get that started
if you release the female hostages.

1182
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,643
Send out the female hostages.

1183
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:49,681
You didn't care about the women hostages

1184
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,885
when you let Angela bleed to death,
did you?

1185
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,963
Did you? No. No.

1186
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:58,589
You're gonna do something for me, first.

1187
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,895
You're gonna go in front
of those cameras out there

1188
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:04,267
and you're gonna make a statement about
how you're responsible for Angela's death.

1189
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,967
Then we'll talk about releasing
the female hostages.

1190
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:11,940
Lieutenant, I'm moving my men into...

1191
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,038
That your backup, Phoebe?

1192
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:17,542
You getting some pressure
to move things along?

1193
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:22,548
So you'll release the hostages
if I make a statement.

1194
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,249
No, I think I've got a better idea.

1195
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,383
You come in here

1196
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:29,293
and you give that statement
in front of me on my camera phone,

1197
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,797
and I'll let all the hostages go.

1198
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:36,130
I come in, and you'll
let all the hostages go.

1199
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:37,597
Yeah.

1200
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,442
That's not gonna happen.

1201
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,051
- Do you want me to try and stop...
- No.

1202
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,990
Whatever you say, sir.

1203
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,793
Give me the log book.

1204
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,328
Liz, I need a pink rose.

1205
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:13,236
There's a florist half a block down 16th.

1206
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,406
She's coming out.

1207
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:29,486
Okay, I'm in the street, Jerry.

1208
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,096
They just gave me Angela's diary.

1209
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:39,999
You're lying.

1210
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,502
She didn't have a diary.

1211
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,932
It's right here. I just
got it out of Evidence.

1212
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:49,376
Read it to me.

1213
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:52,369
Read it so I know you're not lying.

1214
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,583
She's got a rose pressed in the pages here.

1215
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,247
Just read it so I can hear her words.

1216
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:06,888
Quid pro quo, Jerry.
You gotta get me some hostages.

1217
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,826
You read it right now.

1218
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:14,999
"People always say,

1219
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,731
"'you'll know when you find the one.'

1220
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:19,932
"Now I know what they mean.

1221
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:23,441
"Everything seems better now.

1222
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,981
"I can picture my life together with him
at the ranch.

1223
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,082
"At Camelot."

1224
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,092
Keep reading.

1225
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,626
I need you to release hostages.

1226
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:47,057
You can go. Go!

1227
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:52,402
They're coming out. People are coming out.

1228
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:56,873
- Right here, ma'am. This way.
- We got them.

1229
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,873
I'm gonna need more hostages, Jerry.

1230
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:06,784
You read right now
or I take everyone else sitting here out!

1231
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:08,287
You hear me?

1232
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:13,518
"We came up with names for the girls today.

1233
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,825
"Mabel and Vivian. "

1234
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:28,566
You get up. Get up!

1235
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:31,637
He's moving.

1236
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,579
Stay in front of me. Stay in front of me!

1237
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:38,012
Stay in front of me. Stay in front of me.

1238
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,848
Now you show me the rose.

1239
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:40,978
You show it to me.

1240
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:44,490
Then you come in here
and you make your statement.

1241
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,560
You tell the world how you killed Angela.

1242
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:49,027
And then this is done, it's over.

1243
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:52,563
You send me more hostages
and I'll show it to you.

1244
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:53,964
No, you just show it to me.

1245
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:55,729
Two more hostages.

1246
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:02,034
You two. Go, go! Get out!

1247
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:07,610
Two more. Two more coming out.
Two more coming out.

1248
01:28:09,183 --> 01:28:11,174
Right here. Come to me! Come to me!

1249
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,651
- Come on, come on, come on!
- We got them.

1250
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,016
This way.

1251
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:16,417
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Here you go.

1252
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:18,549
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

1253
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:28,224
Show it to me.

1254
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:33,437
You show me it right now
or I will kill somebody!

1255
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,530
Oh, my God.

1256
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,307
Okay, I'm holding up the rose, Jerry.

1257
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:47,712
Don't mess with me.
I can't see it. Put it higher.

1258
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:49,517
Can you see it now?

1259
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:52,788
I can't see it. Hold it up higher.

1260
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:59,763
Get up. Stand. Get up higher. Not that much.

1261
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,128
- You have a shot?
- Negative.

1262
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:07,241
I'm holding it up higher.

1263
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:11,638
Hold it up higher.

1264
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:19,077
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1265
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:30,928
Oh, my God.

1266
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:21,715
So,

1267
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,544
you ready to go to Disney World now?

1268
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:30,587
I'd settle for the Ferris wheel
and a cotton candy.
