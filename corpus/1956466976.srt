a little bit, wouldn't you?

gonna tell me?

Now I'm not so sure
about the "harmless" part.

Here's a thousand for the hour.

674
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,831
And another thousand
for being nice.

675
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,119
You really know how
to make a girl feel special.

676
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,003
I thought that's how it works.

677
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,418
It is.

678
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,424
Wait. Wait.

679
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,587
Jesus Christ,
I screw everything up.

680
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,004
I'm sorry.

681
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,548
Really.

682
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,262
It's okay.

683
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,802
Do you have to go?

684
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,938
Do you have
a little more time for me?

685
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,519
It'll cost you.

686
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,020
(CHUCKLES) Ha!

Oh, no, no! (CHUCKLES)
No, my scarf!

689
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,759
I took the rap for my boss.

690
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,221
He's the one
that killed the guy, so...

691
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,931
He was a big-shot bagman
on the Upper East Side

692
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,265
with a lot of friends.

693
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,806
A lot of cop friends,
as it turned out.

694
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,599
How'd he kill him?

695
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:37,020
Ah, he beat his head in
with a baseball bat.

696
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,938
Jesus.

697
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,233
W-Why would you go to prison
for a man like that?

698
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,526
Got a huge payout.

699
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,952
That's just the way we did it
in my line of work.

700
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,116
Or what used to be
my line of work.

701
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,784
Did what you were told.

702
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,545
You know, kept your mouth shut
and did what you're told.

703
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,127
But that's horrible.

704
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,041
Yes and no.

705
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,882
At the time, the guy
was like family to me.

706
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,217
We took care of each other.

707
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,053
I looked after him.

708
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:09,390
He looked after me
and my family.

709
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,099
You have a wife and kids?

891
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,420
- You?
- Can't complain.

892
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,458
I mean, I've been having
some troubles with my hands

893
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,593
a little bit.

894
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,970
I think I may be
getting some arthritis.

895
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,927
- That sucks.
- Ah, it happens.

896
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:38,809
Makes working kind of difficult.

897
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:41,345
Never figured you the type
for legitimate work.

898
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,059
Got to stay busy somehow, right?

899
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,690
It's not like I got a family
or anything. It's just me.

900
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,525
Life never really turns out
the way you plan it.

901
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,942
No. It doesn't.

902
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,361
Anyway...

903
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,032
You got to do
what you came here for, so...

904
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,121
You're not gonna run?
Put up a fight?

905
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,088
I figure I've outrun
what I got coming to me

906
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,839
way longer than I deserve.

907
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,921
One thing first,
if you don't mind.

908
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,716
Do you know
where I can find Max?

909
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,973
I don't.

910
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,260
Last time I saw him
was before he had his stroke.

911
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:27,525
So you don't know anything
about him faking his death?

912
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:30,356
Well, actually,
I did hear something.

913
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,566
I heard a few guys
talking about that,

914
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:35,983
but I wasn't sure
if it wasn't just talk.

915
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,901
I wish I could help you.

916
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:41,493
I mean, I know I owe you.

917
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,980
Wait. Do you know...
You know what?

918
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,665
I don't know, I'm not sure,
but may...

919
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,454
Maybe I did
hear something about his kid

920
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,874
dumping him in
an old-folk home a while back.

921
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,835

No refunds, no exchanges.

1111

I didn't touch anyone,

1112
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:17,271
and if your employee says I did,
she's a liar.

1113

I don't know. You tell me.

1116
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,362
Well, that's not a very nice
thing to say now, is it?

1117
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,447
I'm afraid I'm all out
of niceness, Trip.

1118
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,658
Well, then, give me
what you owe me, and I will go.

forgot to mention that.

Because I actually
feel sorry for you,
