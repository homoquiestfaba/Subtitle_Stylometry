1
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,854
<i>Felt like a long time
but it's here...</i>

2
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:26,443
<i>Let the good vibes roll in...</i>

3
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>If you look outside
it's snowing...</i>

4
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>And Santa's on the way...</i>

5
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,831
Do those trees look crooked
to you?

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,308
No. Everything looks beautiful,
Elle.

7
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,543
You always do such
an amazing job.

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,379
This is the last winter formal
of our high school career.

9
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,548
Everything needs to be perfect.

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,925
Hey, I heard you got early
acceptance to Stanford.

11
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:51,967
That's incredible.

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:57,140
It was... it was a long shot
but it worked out.

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,352
Um... have you heard back
from any schools, Kam?

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,231
Oh! Principal Holt
just busted the lovebirds.

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,735
I think me and Katie got put
on the naughty list.

16
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,195
I couldn't help myself.

17
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,571
Look what Jay just gave me.

18
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,740
He said the Christmas tree
is to remember tonight

19
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,158
and the rest is for our future.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,242
Aww.

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,619
Yeah.

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,993
Hey, is this dress too short?
I think it's too short.

23
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,044
No. I think your dress looks
great, Sam.

24
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,836
You sure?

25
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,878
Promise.

26
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,381
I need to find a mirror.

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,390
Just ask him to dance already.

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,937
He's smart...
and he's driven.

29
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,647
Sounds like someone I know.

30
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,317
We would be perfect together.

31
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,320
But he just thinks of me
as a friend

32
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,030
and I wouldn't want
to mess that up.

33
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,407
Whatever.

34
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,301
Don't tell me the winner
of every academic award

35
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,078
and president of every
extra-curricular activity

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,789
lacks the confidence to ask
someone to dance.

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,835
Come on, babe.

38
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,131
Um...

39
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,526
Abbi Ferguson just winked at me.

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,510
I'm... I'm gonna ask her
to dance.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,267
Cool! Cool...

42
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,941
Alright everyone.
Gather around, gather around.

43
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,027
It's a very exciting time,
I know.

44
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,069
Come on.

45
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,365
It's the announcement
you've all been waiting for.

46
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:43,663
The crowning of your 2007
winter royals.

47
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,583
Whoop, whoop, whoop!
Go Bobcats!

48
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:49,794
Oh... sorry.

49
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,087
Really Devin?

50
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,008
Sorry. Sorry.
These shoes are really slippery.

51
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,468
What are you wearing?

52
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,511
It's festive... like me.

53
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,474
Just please try and take
this seriously.

54
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,559
And without further ado...

55
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,812
your class president,
Elle Chamberlain.

56
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,818
Yeah!

57
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,906
And your inexplicable choice
for class vice-president...

58
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,157
Devin Ryan.

59
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,246
Thank you, Principal Holt.

60
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:29,334
Class of 2007... you voted
and results are in.

61
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,961
I just want to compliment Elle

62
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,755
and the decorating committee.

63
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,091
I never made it
to any of the meetings,

64
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,592
but look how well
that worked out.

65
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,761
I mean, what a party,
am I right?

66
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,472
Yeah!

67
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,015
Let's not keep
everybody hanging.

68
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,270
And... your first winter
royal is...

69
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:51,648
Bryce McGuire.

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,858
Yes! Whoo!

71
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,624
What? Oh, my turn.

72
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,292
My turn. Okay.

73
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,920
Let's...

74
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,634
This is really good glue.

75
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,803
May I?

76
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,810
Your next winter royal is...

77
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,772
Uh, Elle Chamberlain.

78
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,699
Yeah, Elle!

79
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,583
Congratulations.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,001
Thanks.

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,799
Is it snowing?

82
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,969
And you didn't think I helped
with the decor.

83
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,564
It's magical, right?

84
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,698
Ohhhh!

85
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,176
I am so sorry.

86
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,949
I'd say one of my greatest
strengths is that

87
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,684
I'm calm under pressure.

88
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,063
Managing the data cloud storage
division can be demanding

89
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,565
but I like to think I bring
a sense of balance

90
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,275
to the day-to-day operations.

91
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,028
And I'm proud of
the high standards

92
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,906
we've been able to achieve
in my 10 years here at Zigg.

93
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,368
So... how does it feel
to be on

94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,037
<i>Wired</i> magazine's
35 under 35 list?

95
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,205
Is it cheesy to say

96
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,374
it's a dream come true...
because it is.

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,542
Just in time to show off

98
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,419
at your 15 year
high school reunion.

99
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,796
So far we have a 61 percent
RSVP rate.

100
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,714
That's insane.

101
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,215
I know. It's a good turnout.

102
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,759
No, it's insane that you did
the math on the RSVP's.

103
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,636
The location is locked.

104
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,263
The caterers just confirmed.

105
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,724
And you triple-checked timing
of the party vendor, yes?

106
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,034
They're delivering
everything Wednesday.

107
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,351
Perfect.

108
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,662
This must be the most
well-planned reunion

109
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,855
in the history of reunions.

110
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,106
It better be.

111
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,400
This is the first one
our class has ever had.

112
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,569
Every event since our
senior year winter formal

113
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,237
was such a catastrophe,

114
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,740
they nicknamed us
the cursed class.

115
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,659
Prom was ruined when
the septic tank ruptured.

116
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,787
Graduation was cut short
by a bout of food poisoning.

117
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,289
Wow.

118
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,267
Our five-year reunion was a bust
thanks to Hurricane Sandy

119
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,959
and our 10-year reunion
was in the summer

120
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,837
and literally
three people RSVP'd.

121
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,506
Which is why I moved this one
to Christmas

122
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,508
when everybody would be home
for the holidays.

123
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,761
This year... no excuses.

124
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
No disasters.

125
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,473
I'm gonna get it right.

126
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,728
Another RSVP.
Oh...

127
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,187
Everything okay?

128
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,859
It's just... there's this one
person from my class

129
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,527
who hasn't responded
to the invite.

130
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,905
And you hoped he would?

131
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,157
Oh, I love unrequited
high school love.

132
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,620
I wouldn't go quite that far.
I was valedictorian.

133
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,374
He was salutatorian.
It just would've made sense.

134
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,960
Not the steamy romance I had
in mind but to each their own.

135
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,922
And according to his social
media he's newly single.

136
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,882
You always do your research,
don't you?

137
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,594
Oh, uh... your car will be here
in 15 minutes.

138
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,489
I charged all your devices,
updated your calendar

139
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,823
and packed your food
for your flight.

140
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,766
Thank you.
You are the best.

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,063
Um...

142
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,898
Is there something else, Alma?

143
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,610
It's just, some of the
assistants have been talking.

144
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,363
Is Zigg in some kind
of legal trouble?

145
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,825
Those are just rumors.

146
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,577
If there was something going on,
Tom would tell me.

147
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,996
Especially when we're this close
to going public.

148
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,123
Don't worry about it.

149
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,266
Have a wonderful holiday break

150
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,625
and I'll see you
in the new year.

151
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,544
Okay. Thank you.

152
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,803
<i>Customer service</i>

153
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,471
<i>please head over to
the wrapping aisle.</i>

154
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,640
<i>Customer service
to the wrapping aisle</i>

155
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,435
This is Devin.
Oh, absolutely.

156
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,687
My team is loading the truck
as we speak.

157
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,231
See you soon. Bye-bye.

158
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,362
Dad.

159
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,613
Daughter.

160
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,701
Thank you.

161
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,415
Can I have your credit card
for some in-app purchases?

162
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,791
Nope.

163
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,502
Uh... but you could tackle
this pile of paperwork

164
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,545
I asked you to file.

165
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,213
Paper is so old school.

166
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,899
Why don't you let me build you
a digital database

167
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,967
and you can get rid of
all these file cabinets.

168
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,886
You could put in
a treadmill desk.

169
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,180
First off, have you seen
this warehouse?

170
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,892
I get my steps in every single
day, thank you very much.

171
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,270
Secondly, how did my daughter
get to be such a tech genius?

172
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,481
Digital native.
Evolve or perish.

173
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,941
Hey, so I have a walk-through
at the Hotel Grand

174
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,402
but then I was thinking...
pizza.

175
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,444
Sound good?

176
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,376
Pizza always sounds good.
What's the event?

177
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,409
It's my high school
class reunion.

178
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,203
Fifteen years.

179
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,871
So it's an old people party?

180
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,582
Excuse me, 15 years
was not that long ago

181
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,211
and I was fun back then,
still am.

182
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,295
If you say so.

183
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,275
Plus, I'm not actually going
to the reunion.

184
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,135
I'm just gonna be there for load
in and load out, that is it.

185
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,177
Why?

186
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,556
Uh, because the only reason
people go to a reunion

187
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,935
is to either show off
or relive the past

188
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,979
and I'm not interested in either
one of those things.

189
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,191
Anyone I really wanna catch up
with I just look up online.

190
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,651
Do you know how to do that?

191
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,986
Hey!

192
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,620
Don't forget, offers are due in
by 7:00 on Thursday.

193
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,914
Thanks for coming.
Merry Christmas.

194
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,648
I think we need to work on the
talking points for the kitchen.

195
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,882
Did you mention
the induction oven?

196
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,634
After selling houses
for 10 years

197
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,428
I think I know how
to talk up a kitchen.

198
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,514
Fine. I know we're getting
at least four offers anyway.

199
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,766
We have to review the new
housing development contracts.

200
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,768
Just put it in my calendar.

201
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,688
Our primary way of
communicating these days.

202
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,105
Don't start.

203
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,525
And about tonight...

204
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,320
Yeah. We should just pretend
like everything's normal.

205
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,073
Easier than answering
questions, right?

206
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,369
Okay. See you there.

207
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,509
I love that they included
everyone's yearbook pictures

208
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,054
in the reunion invite email.

209
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,992
Like you don't have
any unfortunate photos

210
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,642
of your high school self.

211
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,019
I burned every single one.

212
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,271
I have news.

213
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,773
News or gossip?

214
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,274
What's the difference?

215
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,252
So, Stan heard from someone
that the New York office

216
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,446
is filling their field reporter
position by Christmas.

217
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,699
Which means that by Friday
you'll know if you're-

218
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:42,035
we're, moving to New York.

219
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,538
Indianapolis I love you
but Big Apple I am ready.

220
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,208
It's a long-shot though.

221
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,253
So is winning a Tony but Audrey
McDonald has six.

222
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,716
Samantha... Sam.

223
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,677
As your friend and forever
hype person,

224
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,571
I can't believe that after
everything you've accomplished,

225
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,347
you still doubt yourself.

226
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,559
Because I'm not usually the one
who gets the thing.

227
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,561
I get close or
I'm in the running

228
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,147
but I don't take the gold.

229
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,900
You know sports metaphors
don't work on me.

230
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,570
I just... wanna feel seen.

231
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,698
Didn't happen much
in high school.

232
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,953
Well... they can't miss
you now.

233
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,132
So we'll bake the cookies
tomorrow for Winterfest

234
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,300
and then let's drive out
to the Christmas ranch

235
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,802
to look at the lights.

236
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,930
Oh, and Tommy and Michelle
are hosting a night of caroling

237
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,598
in their neighborhood.

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,226
I know they'd love to see you
and hear about all your success.

239
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,437
Even though I tell them about it
all the time.

240
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,063
Okay.

241
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,774
I just love having my Noelle
home for a whole week.

242
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,276
It's a perfect holiday.

243
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,111
Mom...

244
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,405
I know, I know.
You go by Elle.

245
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:04,034
I'll just never understand why
you don't use your given name.

246
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,453
Everyone loves
this time of year.

247
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,079
Some more than others.

248
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,331
Welcome home, sweetheart.

249
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,373
Thanks Dad.

250
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,209
Going up, going up.

251
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,837
Honey, look.

252
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,922
I made space on our wall
of achievement

253
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,799
for the Wired article
when it comes out.

254
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,593
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

255
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,053
Nonsense.

256
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,072
We love to see you succeed
and when people come over

257
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,057
they can see everything.

258
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,851
Oh, your father's stocking,

259
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,103
I could use your help
picking out some things.

260
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,982
Actually, I have to swing by
the hotel to do a walk-through

261
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,859
and then I'm meeting up
with the old gang

262
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,653
at Bobbie's Bar tonight.

263
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,572
Well... we'll find a time.

264
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,748
Hi. You must be Fritz.

265
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,833
And you must be 15 minutes late.

266
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,335
I apologize.

267
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,462
I had to borrow my dad's car
and he lost the keys.

268
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,797
It was a whole thing.

269
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,256
No problem at all.

270
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,385
Waiting on clients is what we
at the Hotel Grand do.

271
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,845
Okay, so we also brought
six ivory columns

272
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,740
and then some, just,
really nice holiday foliage

273
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,974
that will fit perfectly
in the layout.

274
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,060
Oh, just in time to meet
the meticulous mastermind

275
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,562
behind this soiree.

276
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,107
If you ever want a job in
event planning let me know.

277
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,608
I'm looking for my replacement.

278
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,657
Devin Ryan.

279
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,409
Elle Chamberlain.

280
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,870
I... I forgot.

281
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,997
Liv It Up is your parents'
company.

282
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,375
Yeah, it was.
They retired.

283
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,751
It's my company now.

284
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,337
I've been emailing
with someone named Alma.

285
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,422
My assistant.

286
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,463
Ah.

287
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,677
Well, I, um... I haven't
seen you since, um...

288
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,761
Graduation?

289
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,056
Uh... it wasn't graduation.
I was surfing in Baja.

290
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,349
I didn't see the point

291
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,393
in wearing a robe and walking
across a stage.

292
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:57,230
Right. Ceremony was never
your thing.

293
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,566
Small world bumping into you
like this.

294
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,859
Not really.

295
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,363
It's the job of the class
president to plan the reunions.

296
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,074
Wait, the job of high school
class president

297
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,452
lasts outside of high school?

298
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,747
Is it like a lifelong position?

299
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,459
You have to admit
that's kind of crazy.

300
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,962
It's not crazy.
It's how reunions work.

301
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,592
Saved by the bell.

302
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,429
Ah, it's about those custom
blue silk tablecloths

303
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,599
you specially requested to match
your exact high school colors.

304
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,476
Be back in a jiff.

305
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,484
I noticed that you didn't RSVP.

306
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,112
Yeah, reunions really aren't
my thing either.

307
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,947
Well, one less name-tag
I need to make.

308
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,117
Um... I appreciate
the business.

309
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,953
Is there somebody else

310
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,623
I should be dealing with
at the company?

311
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,664
Why?

312
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,129
It's just... not to be rude,

313
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,465
but I need this reunion
to go smoothly.

314
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,802
And the fact that the high
school king of goofing off

315
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,970
is in charge of setting up,

316
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,099
it just... makes me
kind of nervous.

317
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,518
How could I possibly consider
that rude?

318
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,647
Uh, look... high school
was a long time ago.

319
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,817
We're northern Connecticut's
premiere events company.

320
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:24,901
You're in good hands.

321
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,737
Sorry about that.

322
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,948
I'm gonna go tape off the stage

323
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,549
so my guys know where
to put everything.

324
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,034
Mmmhmm.

325
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,165
You two make a wonderful team.

326
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,133
Katie!

327
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,300
Yay, you're here!

328
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,470
Oh, I missed you.

329
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,513
I missed you.

330
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,181
Let's immediately get you
a drink

331
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,559
and you can catch me up
on your amazing life.

332
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,436
Uh, my amazing life?

333
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,771
You two have billboards
all over town.

334
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,190
I must've seen your face
five times

335
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,568
on the way home
from the airport.

336
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,653
You and Jay are killing it.

337
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,864
So, where is he?

338
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,158
Oh, finishing up some work,
I'm sure.

339
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,409
He'll be here any minute.

340
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,702
Elle!

341
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,458
Hi.

342
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,587
Well, the reunion fun
can start finally.

343
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,797
Fifteen years...

344
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,716
And still our class president.

345
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,344
And you guys are still
the most epic love story

346
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,637
to come out of Brookswood High.

347
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,224
Married 10 years.

348
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,143
That is amazing.

349
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,270
So what are you guys doing
to celebrate?

350
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,605
Uh...

351
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,565
We just signed a contract
with a new developer.

352
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,733
Yeah.

353
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,568
So that's kind of
the focus right now.

354
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,072
But what about you, are you
running Silicon Valley yet?

355
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,657
Uh, not yet but it's going well

356
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,702
and I love my job and Zigg
is a great place to work.

357
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:01,498
Most likely to succeed
out there succeeding, right?

358
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,626
I'm gonna go see about
getting us some drinks.

359
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,127
Thank you.

360
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,049
So how's the reunion
coming together?

361
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,510
Everything is coming
together perfectly.

362
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,845
Except today I learned
that our main vendor

363
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,889
is none other than Devin Ryan.

364
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,224
You remember him?

365
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,518
I mean, still as infuriating
as ever.

366
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,937
But the numbers are
looking good.

367
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,272
Kam still hasn't RSVP'd.

368
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,982
Don't tell me you're still
crushing on him

369
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,442
after all these years.

370
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,611
Uh, of course...
of course not.

371
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,114
No. No, I mean, it would just be
nice to, you know,

372
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,282
see him and catch up.

373
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,952
And maybe show off
your big, cool job in tech?

374
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,329
I mean, no...
maybe a little.

375
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,546
Uh... I gotta grab this,
um, but I'll be right back.

376
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,672
Okay.

377
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,012
Hey Alma. What's up?

378
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,848
Those rumors about Zigg
having legal issues...

379
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,474
well, those aren't
rumors anymore.

380
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,977
It's really bad, Elle.

381
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,478
How bad are we talking?

382
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,148
They're saying it's a federal
investigation...

383
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,941
as in the FBI.

384
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:12,110
Have you heard from Tom yet?

385
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,612
I cannot afford
to lose this job.

386
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,654
Elle?

387
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,827
Kam?

388
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,292
I thought that was you.

389
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,376
Oh wait, is that him?

390
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,878
The guy that you were
talking about?

391
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,131
Uh... I'll call you back.
Hi!

392
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,383
Hi. Did I interrupt
a work call?

393
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:38,553
Uh... just work drama.
It's probably nothing.

394
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,973
How are you?
I didn't think you were coming.

395
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,076
I didn't think I was either
but then my schedule changed

396
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,019
so I thought, why not?

397
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,771
Well, I'm glad you did.

398
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,732
Should we go inside?

399
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:52,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

400
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,240
You know, they actually
have machines

401
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,594
that print your signature so you
don't have to do it by hand.

402
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,954
Yeah, but all our customers
and our friends appreciate

403
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,582
a handwritten message.

404
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,250
Besides, if I didn't make you
do this,

405
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,419
you might forget
how to use a pen.

406
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,760
I wanna add something
to my Christmas list.

407
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,554
Sky... Christmas is only
a few days away.

408
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,948
It's a little late for that,
honey.

409
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,726
That's okay because all
you have to do is say yes.

410
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,103
Yes to what?

411
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,855
There's this coding and
robotics camp this summer.

412
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,942
It's really hard to get into
but I wanna try.

413
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,068
Okay.

414
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,027
It's four weeks.

415
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,028
Where?

416
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,113
Carnegie Mellon.

417
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,114
Pittsburgh?

418
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,407
Pittsburgh's not that far.

419
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,451
Tell you what, I'll send
you all the info.

420
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,453
The application's due
before the end of the year.

421
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,205
Four weeks is a long time.

422
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,290
Aren't you a little young
for that?

423
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,711
No. Besides,
four weeks without me

424
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,921
means you're free to go do
fun stuff too.

425
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,006
Hmm...

426
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,799
Jam with your band.
Rake the yard.

427
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:58,800
Play poker.

428
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,343
Rake the yard?

429
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,545
I'm 13. How am I supposed
to know what dads do for fun?

430
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:06,725
Please, Dad?

431
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,854
Please, Dad'ing me...

432
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:15,025
Send me the link,
I'll consider it.

433
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,066
Yes!

434
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,372
Let's do this. High school,
eat your heart out.

435
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,127
Sam! You made it.

436
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,756
I cannot believe
how fabulous you look.

437
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,218
Thanks. It comes with the job.

438
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,971
And, uh, a brilliant stylist.

439
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,556
This is James.

440
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,117
I don't know what I would do
without him.

441
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,769
Uh, you'd still be wearing
frosted lip gloss and culottes.

442
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,897
Oh, I missed you guys.

443
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,734
Ladies, it's lovely to meet you
but now I need some drinks.

444
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,652
This round's on me.

445
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,695
Thank you.

446
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,868
There she is,
our fearless leader.

447
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,994
You having fun?

448
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,954
Oh yeah, it's great
seeing everyone.

449
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,724
In fact, it feels like
serendipity reconnecting

450
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,876
with you right now
because I'm actually moving

451
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,544
to the Bay area
after the holidays.

452
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,048
Um... really?

453
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,472
Wow. I mean,
talk about timing.

454
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,558
I'll be managing a senatorial
campaign up there.

455
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,935
It's the big leagues.

456
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,563
That sounds incredible, Kam.

457
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:38,817
But also challenging
and stressful.

458
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,570
Ah, I thrive on it.
I bet we have that in common.

459
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,173
You're the CTO of one of
the hottest tech companies

460
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,699
on the market.

461
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,034
You're a dynamo.
Just like in high school.

462
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,954
It'll be fun getting to know
each other again.

463
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,542
And my clients will be so
impressed that I know you.

464
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:09,264
Uh, hi Tom. I know this is
my third voicemail.

465
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,851
I'm just starting to worry that
I haven't heard back from you.

466
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,145
If you could let me know
everything's okay

467
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,855
that would be great.

468
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,241
Black coffee, please.

469
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,838
I think this is yours.

470
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,673
Thank you.

471
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,760
I wonder if M and N
are around here somewhere.

472
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,845
Huh?

473
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,018
If you're Elle...
I'm looking for M and N.

474
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,438
That's a bad joke.

475
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,482
Uh... I haven't had my coffee
yet, obviously.

476
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,943
Since you're here...
can we talk Santa hats?

477
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,028
What about them?

478
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,529
I wanted to add Santa hats

479
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,132
so we could take a class photo
with everyone wearing one.

480
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,617
That wasn't part of
the original order.

481
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,535
I know. I had the idea
this morning.

482
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,913
But if you can't make that work,
you can say so.

483
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,957
Your boring black coffee.

484
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,042
Oh, thank you.

485
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,713
Oh my gosh, you're
Elle Chamberlain!

486
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,132
Dad, I didn't know you knew
anyone famous.

487
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:27,926
Dad?

488
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:28,927
Famous?

489
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,345
Elle gave a TED Talk
about coding

490
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,638
from the female perspective.

491
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,181
It was awesome.

492
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,727
Uh... well, thank you.

493
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:41,356
Can we rewind to the part
about you having a daughter?

494
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,191
Yeah, this is Skylar.

495
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:46,945
My 13 going on 50 year old who
apparently watches TED Talks.

496
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,533
Elle and I went to high school
together.

497
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,702
I'm a coder too, app design.

498
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,162
Nice. Uh... what software
do you use?

499
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,164
Appery but I also build my own.

500
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,166
That is very impressive.

501
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,127
I'm applying for the summer
coding program

502
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,420
at Carnegie Mellon.

503
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,522
Could I use you as a reference?

504
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,546
Skylar.

505
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,718
I'd be happy to be a reference.
It's a great program.

506
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,137
I was actually a speaker there
last summer.

507
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,178
Of course you were.

508
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,891
Uh, but that's very nice.
Thank you.

509
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:18,601
Yes, thank you.

510
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,104
I'll wait in the car.

511
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,650
I gotta admit, I never
pictured you

512
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,153
as a parent to a teenager.

513
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:32,073
A single parent to a teenager
and trust me, I am aware.

514
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:38,038
She seems so cool and smart
and she likes to build software.

515
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,749
Well, the cool part she clearly
gets from me.

516
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,752
Uh, but the tech part
not so much.

517
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,920
She wants to go to this
coding camp

518
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,798
and I think she should be out
having fun, be a kid.

519
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:54,971
Well, if she's anything like me,
then programming is fun.

520
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,849
And she'll meet a lot of other
kids with similar interests.

521
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,184
Hmm.

522
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,733
Um... I'll add the Santa hats.

523
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,319
I'd appreciate that, thank you.

524
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,671
We haven't done this together
in years.

525
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,839
I didn't realize how much
I missed it.

526
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,175
It wouldn't be our Winterfest
charity fundraiser

527
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:35,679
without my signature snowflake
and snowman cookies.

528
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,180
They always sell out.

529
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,724
Wow, Mom. Look at you!

530
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:42,686
So... tell me everything
about last night.

531
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,022
Who you saw.
What everyone is up to.

532
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,108
How impressed they all are
with your job.

533
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,819
Not everybody cares about
stuff like that.

534
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,154
Everyone seemed really good.

535
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,199
I mean, Katie and Jay
are as in love as ever

536
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:58,868
and killing it in
the real estate world.

537
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,871
Samantha has really come
into her own.

538
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,874
Kam was there.

539
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,377
Oh really?

540
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:12,757
He's, um... actually moving
to the Bay area in the new year.

541
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,803
Isn't that something?
Sounds like fate to me.

542
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:20,348
Does he have a good job?
A Master's degree?

543
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:21,683
Mom...

544
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,269
What? Just asking.

545
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,118
A thank you holiday ham
from Bill Wilson.

546
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,996
Same gift every Christmas,
like clockwork.

547
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:49,794
Oh... right. You keep it.
It'll save you from ordering in.

548
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:57,177
So, um, what are you doing
for Christmas?

549
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,596
I'll go to my Mom's.

550
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,139
I'll just tell her you have
to work.

551
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,311
Well... it's definitely not
how I saw this year going.

552
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,605
Hey, look...

553
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,359
I understood when you told me
you needed space.

554
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,027
It's a lot.

555
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:17,238
Working together, being married.

556
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,325
I guess I just... don't see
where we go from here.

557
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,137
It feels like our life's
running us

558
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,121
instead of the other way around.

559
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:28,583
I know we make a great team
but it's not enough.

560
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,876
We both know that.

561
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,295
It's funny.

562
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,006
We used to be this couple
that everybody wanted to be.

563
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,344
Look at us now.
If only they knew.

564
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:43,348
They'd be disappointed.
Just like we are.

565
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:53,358
This place is so freaking
festive I can't handle it.

566
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,192
Sam?

567
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,570
Hi.

568
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,072
I thought that was you.

569
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,281
Bryce.

570
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:02,992
Hi, I'm James.

571
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,953
Samantha's, uh, platonic
best friend.

572
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,246
Nice to meet you, James.

573
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,499
Sam, you look fantastic.

574
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,584
Thanks. So do you.

575
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:13,837
I assume you guys are here
for the reunion too.

576
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,006
Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.

577
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,049
Bryce was captain
of the swim team...

578
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,634
and winter royal...

579
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,137
and voted best looking
in the yearbook.

580
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,681
And now I'm in grad school
for urban planning in New York.

581
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,808
Oh, how about that.

582
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,853
Sam and I might be there
soon too for work.

583
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,979
We're talking national news

584
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,523
for a certain well-known
morning show.

585
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,983
What are you doing?

586
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,905
I'm starting rumors.
It's one of my many skills.

587
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,337
Well you'll have to look
me up some time.

588
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,491
Both of you.

589
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,288
I gotta go but, um...
see you guys around.

590
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,000
Looking forward to it.

591
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,973
Come on Tom, pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

592
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,933
Where are you, Tom?

593
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:37,795
Thank you, guys.

594
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,300
Good set, guys.
Thank you, it was good.

595
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,473
You guys were great up there.

596
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:49,933
Thanks.

597
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:52,227
Yeah, a couple of guys
from the band are still around.

598
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,268
The band?

599
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:58,400
Like the high school
senior year talent show band?

600
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,609
Yeah.

601
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,861
Didn't you guys have
a terrible name like-

602
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,279
The Harmony Wizards.

603
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,030
Hmm.

604
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,365
What can I say?

605
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,327
We were raised on American
Idol and Harry Potter.

606
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,371
And you were playing
one of Jay's parties

607
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,456
and your amps blew,
like, a fuse?

608
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:15,000
The entire neighborhood
lost power.

609
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:16,501
Yeah, that was us.

610
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,585
Huh.

611
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,063
But I only play
the acoustic guitar now

612
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,213
so you don't have to worry.

613
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:23,216
Oh, well that's...
that's a huge relief.

614
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,428
Yeah, I switched over when,
um, Skylar was born.

615
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,805
Uh, when she was a baby
she loved listening to me play

616
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,158
but now, you know, she'd rather
run around with her friends

617
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,851
than listen to me.

618
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,830
Well, did you wanna hang out
with your parents

619
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,188
when you were her age?

620
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,982
I know you're making
a valid point

621
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,650
but it doesn't mean I like it.

622
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:44,237
Uh... I was kinda hoping
if I won her a couple prizes

623
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,197
from the fun and games area,

624
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,034
maybe she'd be impressed
with her old man.

625
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:50,702
Okay.

626
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,914
One, do not use old man.
We are barely in our 30s.

627
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,709
And two, I could stand
to blow off some steam

628
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,002
at the snowball throw.

629
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,587
Hmm. Everything okay?

630
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,672
Yeah, just some work stress.

631
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:03,714
Okay.

632
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:07,344
Okay. You promise not to be
a sore loser?

633
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,513
No, of course,
because I'm not gonna lose.

634
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,036
You know, I still
would've respected you

635
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,604
if you would have thrown a game
or two my way.

636
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:18,646
You wish.

637
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,235
Hey.
It's your mom's cookie booth.

638
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,158
Oh wow, these look amazing.
Skylar's gonna love these.

639
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,328
And it matches
the keychain I won.

640
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,915
Hey, Elle!
Wow, those look delicious.

641
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:38,875
Hey Kam.

642
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,585
Put me down for a box too.

643
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,215
Devin Ryan.
It's been a long time.

644
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:47,384
Yeah. It, uh, it has.

645
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,969
Devin's company's doing
the setup for the reunion.

646
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,013
Nice. So you're still living
around here?

647
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,055
Yeah.

648
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:56,101
That must be a trip.
I can't imagine.

649
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,686
What do you mean?

650
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,605
Just, you know, living
in your hometown still.

651
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,275
Anyway, um... a bunch
of people

652
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,236
are gathering
at Page Park tomorrow.

653
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,280
Wanna go, Elle?
Go sledding together?

654
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:12,575
You too.

655
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:14,786
Uh, sure.
That'd be great.

656
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,122
Devin, you in?

657
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,500
Why not?

658
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:29,883
Look what I found.

659
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Don't mind me.

660
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,641
What are you wearing and why?

661
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:39,328
Please tell me you didn't
dig this up

662
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:41,604
just to make fun of my
teenage style choices.

663
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,315
I wanted to see if you and Elle
were friends back then.

664
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,695
We didn't really run
in the same circles, Sky.

665
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:52,699
She was more of a color
inside the lines kind of person

666
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,576
and I was... fun.

667
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,327
Can I have my laptop
back please?

668
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,413
She's super smart, Dad.

669
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,081
I'm aware of that.

670
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:06,338
Hey, I was thinking.
Um... this coding camp.

671
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:10,216
I looked at the website
and I read some reviews

672
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:13,094
and it looks pretty fantastic.

673
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,140
And I hear you'll meet a lot of
kids with the same interests.

674
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,559
Does that mean I can go?

675
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,811
You promise to FaceTime me
twice a day?

676
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:24,230
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, Dad.

677
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,363
And this, um, digital database
you mentioned...

678
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:33,907
is that something you could
really build?

679
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,408
Totally!

680
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,969
Uh, you would have one section
for inventory

681
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,453
and another for accounts.

682
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,806
I can use it as my project
for the coding camp application.

683
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,830
I can start right now.

684
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:48,671
Sorry. I'll use mine.

685
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,215
There it is.

686
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:58,765
I used to love coming here
as a kid.

687
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,308
Even in high school.

688
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:02,644
On snow days we used
to all show up

689
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,604
and we would compete
to see how many people

690
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:05,814
we could fit on a sled.

691
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:08,125
I never really understood
the fun of sledding.

692
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,293
I mean, all the way up a hill

693
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,836
just for a few seconds
of sliding down,

694
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,279
during which you could break
your arm or ruin your blowout.

695
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,156
Where's your sense of adventure?

696
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,368
Oh... he's here.

697
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:19,744
Who?

698
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:20,786
Bryce.

699
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,666
- Oh, um... Samantha...
- Hey there.

700
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,418
Hey guys.

701
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,211
I see you decided on staying
warm and dry.

702
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:29,713
We don't have sleds.

703
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,005
Well, I'm happy to share.

704
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,317
Sam, you can go first
and then, uh,

705
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,260
you and I can go down together.

706
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:42,267
Um... I would,
I would love to.

707
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,853
Yeah, sledding is totally,
uh, my thing.

708
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,147
Uh... can you just give us
a sec?

709
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,898
Great. I'll meet you up top.

710
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,486
I thought you knew.

711
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:56,823
It's like I invent new ways
to embarrass myself.

712
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,158
Just say the word

713
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,635
and I won't even so much
as look at him again.

714
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:03,163
No, no. Don't be silly.
He likes you.

715
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,664
Go. Have some adventure.

716
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,917
I'll sit here and enjoy
my hot chocolate.

717
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:12,839
Thank you.

718
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:29,189
Hey. Where's James?

719
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,358
Sledding with Bryce.

720
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:33,588
At least one of us
is getting noticed.

721
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,404
What do you mean?

722
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,324
This reunion is bringing up
all sorts of

723
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,451
high school feelings for me.

724
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,871
Isn't it strange how
you can go make

725
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,414
a whole life for yourself

726
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:48,416
and then you're still trying
to impress people

727
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:49,876
you don't even know anymore?

728
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,880
Actually not as strange
as you might think.

729
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,385
And everybody loved you
in high school.

730
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,180
No, everyone loved you
in high school.

731
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:04,307
I was in the background...

732
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:06,684
Invisible.

733
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,521
Not to me you weren't.

734
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,277
I called you when I was out
in San Francisco last year.

735
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:20,031
I know, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

736
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:23,201
I just get so tunnel-visioned
with my job sometimes

737
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,412
that I forget to have
a personal life.

738
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:32,210
You work so hard, do everything
you're supposed to.

739
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:36,256
It's like, does it even matter,
you know?

740
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,757
What's it all for?

741
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,969
Elle, is everything okay?

742
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:46,307
Yeah. Yeah I'm, uh...
just having a moment.

743
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:51,813
Hey. Uh... can I talk to you
for a second?

744
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,481
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

745
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,211
Let me just say, if you wanna
race me down the hill

746
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:59,654
I'm gonna warn you, my middle
name is Speed.

747
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:03,033
Um... the hotel called.
We have a problem.

748
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,369
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing
we can't handle.

749
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,131
The fire in the kitchen
was containable.

750
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,716
Okay.

751
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:22,469
But the smoke and water damage
to the ballroom is significant.

752
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,721
As much as I've so enjoyed
working with you both,

753
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,849
there is no way we can host
your reunion.

754
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:33,855
We can fix this.

755
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,648
We just need to find
another location.

756
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,418
At least your props and
equipment weren't loaded in yet.

757
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:38,485
Uh, Elle...

758
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:39,943
Hmm?

759
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,322
We loaded it all in last night.

760
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,407
I wanted the crew to get
an early start

761
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:47,952
to make sure everything
would be ready for tomorrow.

762
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,579
Including the Santa hats.

763
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,333
Insurance will cover
what we lost,

764
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,752
but even if you do find
another place,

765
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:59,756
all my holiday stuff is already
spoken for for other events.

766
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,185
Is it the worst thing
if there's no reunion?

767
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,805
People have been looking
forward to this for months

768
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:09,307
and I for one am not gonna
let them down.

769
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:12,352
Has our class had
an extraordinarily

770
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,270
long list of calamities?

771
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:15,522
Yes.

772
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:18,024
Is it strange that
it keeps happening?

773
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:18,942
Yes.

774
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,485
Hmm.

775
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,527
But does that really mean
that our class is cursed?

776
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,324
- Yes?
- No!

777
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,704
This is just a small roadblock.
It's a speed-bump.

778
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:32,372
If it seems like things
are going wrong,

779
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,141
well that's when you need
to roll up your sleeves

780
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,792
and get to work.

781
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:39,379
We have a little over 24 hours
to pull it together.

782
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:41,923
This Christmas class reunion
will happen.

783
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:47,721
Alright, team.

784
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,097
Ideas. Shout them out.

785
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,975
My brother in law runs
the bakery down on Main.

786
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,703
I'll see if he can get us
some free desserts.

787
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,103
We have a bunch
of small tchotchkes

788
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,479
we use to stage houses.

789
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,690
Christmas trees, lights, bows.

790
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,316
I can contact the local
news station,

791
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,586
see if they're willing to help
out with some sound equipment.

792
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,946
Perfect. We'll take everything
we can get.

793
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:06,031
Thanks everybody.

794
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,656
Okay.

795
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:10,845
I'm gonna research some
new locations, make some calls.

796
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,430
And I'll look around
the warehouse to see

797
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:14,598
if there's anything that even
resembles holiday inventory

798
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,458
that I can scrounge up.

799
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,292
That's great.

800
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,460
Okay.

801
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Good luck.

802
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:22,672
Alright.

803
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:26,967
Hi.

804
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,511
Hey.

805
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:30,263
What are you doing here?

806
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,640
Just more reunion planning.

807
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:35,185
Your dad went to go locate
some inventory.

808
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,604
See, that's exactly what
I'm trying to help him with.

809
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:38,897
If he had a digital database,

810
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,815
everything would be
at his fingertips.

811
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:44,235
That's... a really good idea.

812
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:46,613
You wanna see?

813
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:48,531
Absolutely.

814
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:53,370
Ever since my
grandparents retired,

815
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:55,330
Dad has really expanded
some things around here,

816
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:56,956
except for the technology.

817
00:40:56,998 --> 00:40:59,834
So, I thought I'd help him join
the 21st century.

818
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,838
These are all of your
dad's clients?

819
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:06,883
He has some pretty big accounts.

820
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,968
Everybody loves my dad.

821
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,013
He's always dependable so
his customers are super loyal.

822
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,308
Anyway, I've got some more
backend work to do

823
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,935
but this is pretty much it.

824
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,147
Well, I would say that you're
off to a really great start.

825
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:23,858
You are lightyears ahead of
where I was at your age.

826
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:27,445
Getting feedback from you is,
like, really awesome.

827
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:30,615
Well, you're, like,
really awesome.

828
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,462
I'm sure you're realizing
who the real brains

829
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,664
behind this operation is.

830
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:39,666
Honey, can you give us a second?

831
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,334
Bye Elle.

832
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,711
Bye Skylar.

833
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:47,007
So there might be one possible

834
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:50,135
last resort option
for some decorations.

835
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,636
But it won't be pretty.

836
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,235
Welcome to the land
of lost decorations.

837
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,904
Otherwise known as
the storage room

838
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,824
where I keep the older stuff
no one wants to rent.

839
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:16,703
Hmm.

840
00:42:20,415 --> 00:42:23,001
My mother would love this.

841
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,753
I think she would
honestly faint.

842
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,589
There is no one who loves
Christmas more than her.

843
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,008
Uh, I'll take that bet.

844
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,135
You should see
my parents' place.

845
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,221
They have an inflatable nativity
scene on the front lawn.

846
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,723
Year round.

847
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,768
That's pretty good but,
uh, I'll do you one better.

848
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:43,146
Elle is my nickname.

849
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:45,982
My given name is... Noelle.

850
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:47,817
You're joking.

851
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,778
No, I'm not.

852
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,864
Game over, you win.

853
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:58,328
Okay, so I'm guessing this
isn't up to the usual

854
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,788
Elle Chamberlain standards

855
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,539
but, I mean, it's better
than nothing.

856
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:05,585
Well, it'll definitely need
some TLC.

857
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:08,213
But, you know, we can make
this work.

858
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:09,506
Where do we even start?

859
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,900
Well, anything that
doesn't disintegrate

860
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,425
when you touch it
is up for grabs.

861
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,885
Oh. Okay.

862
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,143
This is like a dream playground
for a kid.

863
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:23,269
Skylar must love it.

864
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:27,190
Well, she did. She's a little
old for it now.

865
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:29,275
Which she constantly
reminds me about.

866
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,779
She likes you though.

867
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:35,615
She's a great kid, Devin.

868
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:37,659
And you're doing
a wonderful job.

869
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:41,246
What about Skylar's mom?

870
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,457
Yeah, they FaceTime
twice a week.

871
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,876
She's deployed overseas,
uh, Air Force.

872
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:49,796
We were, uh, just a couple
of college kids

873
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,923
and it didn't work out.

874
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,385
Never would've planned my life
to go this way

875
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:59,889
but sometimes the best things
are the ones you didn't plan.

876
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:05,979
Devin Ryan, you are full
of surprises.

877
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:10,191
Fifteen years ago I couldn't get
you to attend a single student

878
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:14,237
government meeting and now
you're helping save the reunion.

879
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,866
Thank you.
I really appreciate all this.

880
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,052
Yeah, well if you want
some assistance with finding

881
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:24,039
some other venues, I could
help make some calls.

882
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,125
Sure, uh, that would be,
um, great.

883
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,710
If you wanna swing by
tomorrow morning?

884
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:30,461
Sure.

885
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:35,842
Oh.

886
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:36,884
Hey.

887
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,513
Uh... Bobbie said
that he could lend us

888
00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:42,140
some of the chafing dishes

889
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,018
so I figured I'd just swing by
and pick them up.

890
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,020
I just came by to pick up
some of the decor

891
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,564
we lent him for his
holiday karaoke.

892
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,066
Ah, right.

893
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:55,862
Hey, my brother asked about
Christmas Eve dinner.

894
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,822
I said you'd be
at your mother's.

895
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:01,451
This will be the first
Christmas we spent apart

896
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:02,994
since we were teenagers.

897
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,954
I know.

898
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,309
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Christmas morning

899
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,251
without your freshly baked
monkey bread.

900
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:14,756
Makes it all feel
very... real.

901
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:20,261
Well, I should... yeah.

902
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:31,856
Tom, I'm trying really, really
hard not to freak out over here.

903
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,585
If you could give me a call back
in the morning,

904
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:36,361
I would greatly appreciate it.

905
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:40,907
Elle, honey...
you have a visitor.

906
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:45,578
Hey.

907
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,248
Hey. So, how's operation
save the reunion going?

908
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:52,127
Uh, great.
It's, uh, it's gonna be great.

909
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:55,630
We're gonna figure it out
and find a new venue.

910
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:56,881
It'll be great.

911
00:45:57,298 --> 00:45:58,508
Very convincing.

912
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:00,468
Look, it's pretty late

913
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,946
and people who don't work
as hard as you

914
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,722
have probably already gone home
for the day.

915
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,181
Right.

916
00:46:05,223 --> 00:46:07,475
There's this really cool thing
called dinner.

917
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:08,768
Maybe you've heard of it?

918
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,771
I think it kind of rings a bell.

919
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:14,315
So... why don't we go
grab a bite?

920
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:18,069
I have still so much to do.

921
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,655
Come on, you deserve a break.

922
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,324
Plus, I already made
reservations.

923
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,286
One of our old favorites.

924
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:29,831
I guess I could go
for a nice meal.

925
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,629
I used to think this was
the epitome of fine dining

926
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:38,506
when we were kids.

927
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:42,052
I did too.
I am so sorry.

928
00:46:42,093 --> 00:46:44,804
This is not what I was picturing
for our first dinner.

929
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:46,056
We should go somewhere else.

930
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,975
No. Sometimes the best things

931
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,561
are the ones that you didn't
plan, right?

932
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:58,568
And this is definitely
the only restaurant in town

933
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,987
with moussaka a la Christmas.

934
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,864
Red and green sauce.

935
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,074
Brilliant.

936
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:08,161
Hey, we're all in town for the
nostalgia so let's go for it.

937
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:11,831
Here's to being old enough
to drink at the classiest

938
00:47:11,873 --> 00:47:13,500
Greek restaurant
in the tru-state area.

939
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,209
Cheers.

940
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:16,293
Cheers.

941
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:27,097
Oh, sorry I couldn't make
the emergency meeting today

942
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:30,308
but I had a couple big
conference calls.

943
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:34,896
But this is what reunions
are all about.

944
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:36,313
Reconnecting.

945
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,524
True.

946
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:43,029
I have to be honest with you.
I googled you a few days ago.

947
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:45,365
You're a really
intriguing person.

948
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,783
I mean, you always were.

949
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:51,121
Um... I actually looked you up
online too.

950
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:53,164
You did?

951
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:56,209
I was also curious.

952
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:57,544
Mmhmm.

953
00:47:58,294 --> 00:48:03,299
I, um... I had a huge crush
on you senior year.

954
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,550
Really?

955
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:08,013
Okay, don't laugh.

956
00:48:08,054 --> 00:48:12,434
But I had the perfect fantasy
planned in my head

957
00:48:12,475 --> 00:48:13,977
for winter formal.

958
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:17,313
You would surprise me at my
house all dressed to the nines,

959
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:19,065
holding a corsage.

960
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:22,902
And you would ask me if you
could escort me to the ball

961
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:25,572
and then we would dance
the night away

962
00:48:25,613 --> 00:48:26,698
with all of our friends.

963
00:48:29,325 --> 00:48:30,702
Why didn't you say something?

964
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:33,163
I... I don't know.

965
00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:36,166
Uh... I was working up the nerve

966
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:40,086
and then you asked
Abbi Ferguson to dance.

967
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:41,588
Oh.

968
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:45,258
And obviously the rest of
the night went a bit sideways.

969
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,343
Yes, it did.

970
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,764
Why didn't you ever ask me out?

971
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:55,310
To be honest with you, Elle...
you were way out of my league.

972
00:48:55,852 --> 00:48:56,978
What?

973
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,357
Valedictorian.
Class president.

974
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:03,234
President of a lot
of things actually.

975
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:09,908
Speaking of being president
of things...

976
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,534
I'm putting together
an advisory panel

977
00:49:11,576 --> 00:49:14,579
of tech industry professionals
for one of my clients.

978
00:49:15,413 --> 00:49:17,332
I'd love to get your feedback
on it.

979
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:23,004
Oh. Uh... sure.
Mmhmm.

980
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:24,506
Great.

981
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,140
Alright. What do we got?

982
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:36,118
So I put together a spreadsheet
of 23 potential venues

983
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:38,269
within a 40-mile radius.

984
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:40,772
I should've ordered doubles.

985
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,349
They're booked through Easter.

986
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,654
We definitely need heat
in the bathrooms, right?

987
00:49:48,988 --> 00:49:50,907
Yes, having a broken elevator

988
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:54,494
for a restaurant on the 36th
floor is a deal breaker.

989
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:58,707
Your auditorium is still
an active crime scene

990
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:00,208
for a double murder?

991
00:50:04,504 --> 00:50:06,214
Exotic dancers?

992
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:11,261
Your name, "The North Pole",
is very misleading.

993
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:18,685
Well, that was the last one
on the list.

994
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:21,271
We're toast.

995
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:23,835
We just need to think outside
the box.

996
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,276
We're resourceful people.

997
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:29,529
We could turn any space
into a winter wonderland.

998
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:33,700
I mean, you even made magic
out of our high school gym

999
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:34,742
at winter formal.

1000
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,954
It wasn't all magic that night.

1001
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Let's do that again.

1002
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:51,551
Flood a gym?

1003
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:52,593
Yes.

1004
00:50:53,678 --> 00:50:56,931
No. I mean, not the flooding
part, the gymnasium.

1005
00:50:56,973 --> 00:51:00,935
It's big, it's nostalgic,
and it has heated bathrooms.

1006
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:05,565
That's either the greatest
idea of all time or the worst.

1007
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:08,401
But we really don't have
any other options, do we?

1008
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:10,153
Who would we even call?

1009
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,571
Believe it or not,

1010
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:13,773
Principal Holt is still running
the show at Brookswood.

1011
00:51:15,116 --> 00:51:16,868
And I know exactly where
to find him.

1012
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:20,705
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!

1013
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:21,790
Merry, merry.

1014
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:23,708
Ho, ho, ho!

1015
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:24,876
Best time of the year.

1016
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:27,879
It's a shock, I know.

1017
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:30,715
I mean... he looks great.

1018
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:31,757
Smile for Santa!

1019
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,554
And have you been
good this year?

1020
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:38,181
Aren't you guys a little...

1021
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,517
not eight years old to be
visiting Santa Clause?

1022
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,060
Well...

1023
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:42,894
We're just...

1024
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,771
Shh. It's okay.

1025
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:48,942
This is a safe space
for true believers like us.

1026
00:51:55,949 --> 00:51:58,034
Hi. Uh...

1027
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:00,328
Principal Holt,
it's Elle Chamberlain.

1028
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,163
Principal Holt?

1029
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:05,250
My dear, my name
is Santa Clause.

1030
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:10,964
Of course, uh, Santa.
Do you remember me?

1031
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:13,425
Santa Clause never forgets
a name.

1032
00:52:13,466 --> 00:52:15,635
Especially from the nice list.

1033
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:19,138
Hello Santa.

1034
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,349
Devin Ryan.

1035
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,226
I'm pretty sure your name's

1036
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:24,769
still at the top of
the naughty list.

1037
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:29,065
We have a really big favor
to ask.

1038
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:32,652
Can we use the high school's gym
for the reunion tonight?

1039
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:35,947
Well, that doesn't sound
as much like a favor

1040
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,741
as a Christmas wish.

1041
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:40,785
That's really Santa's specialty.

1042
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:45,081
Take a seat.

1043
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,208
Okay.

1044
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,798
However, the school is closed

1045
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,301
for the remainder
of the year, so...

1046
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,844
I know, and we wouldn't
be asking

1047
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:02,682
unless it was our truly last
and only hope.

1048
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,642
We literally have hours
before the reunion

1049
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:07,687
is supposed to begin
and we're desperate.

1050
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:10,482
And you know, the class of 2007

1051
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:13,360
has faced its challenges
over the years.

1052
00:53:13,735 --> 00:53:16,488
Some of them were
your holly-jolly doing,

1053
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:18,531
if I do recall, my dear boy.

1054
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:19,866
Smile.

1055
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,330
Please, Santa.

1056
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:28,333
We just wanna get
the class together.

1057
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,876
It would be our Christmas wish.

1058
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,710
Peppermint!

1059
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,920
Peppermint.

1060
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,885
If you promise me there
will be no mischief... Devin.

1061
00:53:40,553 --> 00:53:43,515
I will grant you
your Christmas wish.

1062
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:45,058
Thank you, Santa.

1063
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:48,895
Oh... got me.

1064
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:54,776
The magic of Christmas.

1065
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,078
Perfect.

1066
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,082
Elle, come check this out.

1067
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,334
This is looking great.

1068
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:12,460
Great!

1069
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:18,550
Your brother in law really
came through for us.

1070
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:20,759
Thanks.

1071
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,262
Have you seen Kam?

1072
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:24,323
He said that he'd set up
the check-in table

1073
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,433
but I haven't heard from him.

1074
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:27,809
No, sorry.

1075
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:36,609
Not bad for an emergency
back-up plan.

1076
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:43,283
You did it.

1077
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:44,659
Uh, we did it.

1078
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:48,288
Tonight the cursed class
breaks the curse.

1079
00:54:48,997 --> 00:54:50,790
Couldn't have done it
without you.

1080
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:53,084
Hmm, something tells me
you would've found a way.

1081
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:01,843
What a difference
15 years makes.

1082
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:05,638
Yeah. I should, uh, make
sure the, um...

1083
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,515
speakers are plugged in.

1084
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:09,117
And I'm gonna go check on
the name-tags.

1085
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:10,518
Okay.

1086
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:23,531
You know, this place brings back
so many memories.

1087
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:26,493
We should recreate our yearbook
photo with the group

1088
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:28,703
except without the embarrassing
hairstyles this time.

1089
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:33,249
Katie, is everything okay?

1090
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,503
Jay moved out a month ago.

1091
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:39,130
What?

1092
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:41,400
Please don't say anything.
I don't know what we're doing.

1093
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:44,010
All this on top of that
and it's Christmas...

1094
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:45,052
my head is swimming.

1095
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:47,514
Hey. Hey.

1096
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:54,854
I'm so sorry you guys are going
through this.

1097
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,233
I guess I always just imagined
the two of you

1098
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:00,402
as the perfect couple.

1099
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:03,988
I know, everyone thinks that.
I thought that.

1100
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,990
But there's no such thing
as perfect.

1101
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:10,161
We used to have fun together,
make each other laugh.

1102
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:15,208
And now... I guess I was kinda
hoping the reunion

1103
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,043
would bring something back
for us.

1104
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:19,546
Maybe it will.

1105
00:56:19,587 --> 00:56:21,589
You'll find your way
through this.

1106
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,215
Oh! You look amazing.

1107
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,222
Okay, um... and this
isn't working with this.

1108
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:12,932
What's... what's wrong?

1109
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:19,147
I was hoping to have some good
news about New York for tonight.

1110
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,899
Samantha...

1111
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:25,653
Please remember that you are
bravely pursuing your dreams

1112
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:27,822
and it is working.

1113
00:57:28,865 --> 00:57:32,744
All that matters is what
you think of you.

1114
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:37,874
Well, and what I think of you.
Let's go get 'em.

1115
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:46,758
Hey. Which... which one?

1116
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:49,094
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1117
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,348
The green one, obviously.

1118
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:57,894
Thank you for
your fashion advice.

1119
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:00,730
I can't believe you're going
to a school dance at your age.

1120
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:02,190
It's a reunion.

1121
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:04,293
And you just went to a middle
school Christmas dance,

1122
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:05,819
like, two weeks ago.

1123
00:58:06,444 --> 00:58:09,364
Yeah, but I'm 13 and you're old.

1124
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,950
Besides, isn't this
the same reunion

1125
00:58:11,991 --> 00:58:14,994
you said you had no interest in,
like, three days ago?

1126
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,497
You're going because of Elle,
aren't you?

1127
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:20,166
- I'm going because...
- Mmhmm.

1128
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,794
I'm helping a friend
and I'm a man of my word.

1129
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,255
It's okay, Dad.
I like her.

1130
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:28,341
You haven't gone out with anyone
in a long time.

1131
00:58:28,383 --> 00:58:29,426
I think you should.

1132
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:32,053
You do?

1133
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,096
Of course.

1134
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:36,933
And if it's Elle, maybe we can
visit her in California

1135
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:38,852
and I can get an internship
at Zigg.

1136
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:43,481
Ah, your diabolical master plan
has been revealed.

1137
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,900
Come on.
She's incredibly cool.

1138
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:47,192
Yeah.

1139
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,280
And I like the way
you look at her.

1140
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:52,699
I think she makes you happy.

1141
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,161
She's not the only one.

1142
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:58,163
Come here!

1143
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:00,707
- Aww... Dad!
- Come here.

1144
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:03,460
I love you, kiddo.

1145
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:04,794
I love you too, Dad.

1146
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:15,055
Come in.

1147
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:22,979
Are you gonna wear
these tonight?

1148
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:25,899
No.

1149
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,651
But I do kinda feel like
I'm back in high school

1150
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:30,403
getting ready for a dance.

1151
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,948
You'll have fun.
You have so much to talk about.

1152
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,326
Living in the city,
your big job.

1153
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,496
What if all of that went away?

1154
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:41,748
What do you mean?

1155
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:50,799
I've always felt pressure to
achieve and succeed in school

1156
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,884
and then in work.

1157
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:55,470
Striving towards perfection.

1158
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:58,973
I've built my whole world
around it, my identity.

1159
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:02,936
So... what if it goes away?

1160
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:05,438
What's left?

1161
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:19,327
You know, as a parent
you can get caught up

1162
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,079
in your child's successes

1163
01:00:21,121 --> 01:00:23,289
as a way to prove to the world
that you did a good job.

1164
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,459
I may be guilty of that.

1165
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:32,215
But Noelle, all your father
and I ever wanted

1166
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:35,093
was for you to know that
whatever you set your mind to

1167
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,511
you could do.

1168
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,264
We just wanted you to know
how capable you are

1169
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:41,516
so you could pursue
every opportunity.

1170
01:00:42,308 --> 01:00:45,103
I'm sorry if I pushed you
too hard.

1171
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:49,149
But I never wanted you to be
so caught up in achieving

1172
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,526
that you miss what's important
in life.

1173
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:57,532
I just... I don't know what
my path forward looks like.

1174
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:02,037
I don't know what will make
me happy.

1175
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:04,831
That's okay.

1176
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,835
It might be a bumpy road
to get there but you will.

1177
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:12,839
Thanks Mom.

1178
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:22,015
Were you expecting anyone?

1179
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:23,975
No.

1180
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:38,907
Elle... you look beautiful.

1181
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:42,077
Uh... what are you doing here?

1182
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:48,291
I was wondering if
you'd like to join me

1183
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:51,211
at our school dance...
15 years late.

1184
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,689
I thought I'd go all in
on the high school feels

1185
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:55,632
and bring you that corsage too.

1186
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:04,057
You two have to pose
by the tree.

1187
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:05,558
Mom.

1188
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,060
I would be happy to.

1189
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:22,301
I feel terrible I couldn't help
with the setup today.

1190
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:25,328
I had yet another major
situation with a client.

1191
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:28,289
It never ends.
But you know how that goes.

1192
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:43,513
Talk about a blast
from the past.

1193
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,557
I am so glad we did this.

1194
01:02:46,641 --> 01:02:50,020
I have to admit,
I'm a bit nervous.

1195
01:02:50,061 --> 01:02:51,896
I hope this all goes smoothly.

1196
01:02:51,938 --> 01:02:53,618
Don't worry, I will be
right here with you.

1197
01:02:58,069 --> 01:03:00,613
Uh, I am so sorry, Elle.

1198
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:03,533
I really have to take this.
Can you hold that thought?

1199
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:06,036
I'll, uh, see you inside.

1200
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:13,542
Okay.

1201
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:17,213
<i>The trees and grass
are frosting up</i>

1202
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:20,467
<i>There's something in the air...</i>

1203
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:23,970
<i>It's cold outside, let's cozy up</i>

1204
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:27,891
<i>In your grandfather's
favorite chair...</i>

1205
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:32,020
Oh, my God!
You look amazing.

1206
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:33,646
You guys look stunning.

1207
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:35,523
Elle Chamberlain for the win.

1208
01:03:35,565 --> 01:03:36,858
Everyone's having a blast.

1209
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,985
It really did come together,
didn't it?

1210
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:43,782
Speaking of coming together...
are you here on a date?

1211
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:46,826
Oh, um... yeah.

1212
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:51,164
So, uh... Kam and I have
actually hung out a bit this week

1213
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:54,584
and then, um, he asked me
to the dance.

1214
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,211
It's so romantic.

1215
01:03:56,252 --> 01:03:58,630
Look at you, finally getting
everything you wanted.

1216
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:00,465
Yeah, I guess so.

1217
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,933
Um... I gotta take this.
I'll be right back.

1218
01:04:09,974 --> 01:04:10,975
Save me a dance.

1219
01:04:11,017 --> 01:04:12,102
- Okay.
- Okay.

1220
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,151
No.

1221
01:04:30,453 --> 01:04:33,331
Hey... Elle?

1222
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,335
What's wrong?

1223
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:43,008
Um, nothing. Everything...
everything is fine.

1224
01:04:55,186 --> 01:04:56,771
Hey. If nothing's wrong

1225
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:59,024
then why were you standing
outside staring at your phone

1226
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:01,484
like you just found out
Christmas was cancelled?

1227
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,490
Zigg is officially over.

1228
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:14,247
Everything that I've been
working so hard for is gone.

1229
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:20,670
No more 35 under 35 list.
It's... it's all over.

1230
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:26,551
Elle, I am... I am so sorry.

1231
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:31,639
But this isn't a reflection
of you.

1232
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:35,018
It will be.

1233
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,561
Trust me, in the valley,

1234
01:05:36,603 --> 01:05:40,065
Zigg will be the butt of
every joke and so will I.

1235
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:42,734
And the timing?

1236
01:05:43,526 --> 01:05:45,126
When I'm back here
at my old high school,

1237
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:47,072
surrounded by everybody

1238
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,741
who thinks I've become
this big success.

1239
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:54,746
My resume is how I know
who I am.

1240
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:06,424
When I, uh, first found out
I was gonna be a father...

1241
01:06:07,258 --> 01:06:09,552
I was in total denial.

1242
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:13,682
I mean, I was supposed to be
out traveling with my band.

1243
01:06:13,723 --> 01:06:15,141
The Melody Magicians?

1244
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:18,353
The Harmony Wizards.

1245
01:06:20,271 --> 01:06:23,900
And, um...
I had to give that all up.

1246
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:26,236
I had to recalibrate.

1247
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:32,325
I did not see myself
as a parent but I was.

1248
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:36,496
It was, uh, it was in there
I just didn't know it yet.

1249
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:41,960
Because when I held Skylar
for the first time

1250
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,087
and watched her take her
first steps

1251
01:06:44,129 --> 01:06:45,880
and then she called me "Dad"..

1252
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:51,636
It just felt like the most
right thing in the world.

1253
01:06:54,014 --> 01:06:56,850
So, having Skylar helped you
find yourself?

1254
01:06:59,477 --> 01:07:01,855
I've never felt more lost
in my life.

1255
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:07,652
You're not lost.
You're just changing directions.

1256
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:12,949
Steve Jobs lost
his company twice

1257
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:15,285
before he had major success.

1258
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,872
What? What, I read.

1259
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:25,295
Devin Ryan, you are continually
full of surprises.

1260
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:29,299
What are you even doing here?

1261
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:33,386
I thought that you weren't
interested in reunions.

1262
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:37,223
I got a truckload of dusty
never-used decorations in there.

1263
01:07:37,265 --> 01:07:39,142
I'm just here to keep
an eye on them,

1264
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,560
make sure nothing goes wrong.

1265
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,645
Yeah. Hmm.

1266
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:44,689
Can't trust these
high school kids.

1267
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:49,319
I'm glad you came.

1268
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:51,718
I wouldn't wanna miss
your big night.

1269
01:07:57,577 --> 01:07:58,577
Shall we?

1270
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:13,384
Hey.

1271
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:16,888
Let tonight be magical.

1272
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,348
Tomorrow's a new day.

1273
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,269
There you are.

1274
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:24,455
I've been looking
all over for you.

1275
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,814
Can I grab you for a minute?

1276
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:28,108
There is something
very important

1277
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:29,484
I need to talk to you about.

1278
01:08:30,235 --> 01:08:34,989
Um... Devin, can I find
you later?

1279
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:38,909
Yeah.

1280
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:41,913
Come on.

1281
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,799
I just heard the news
about Zigg.

1282
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:55,468
Man, what a terrible thing to
happen so close to Christmas.

1283
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:58,179
But I can help you fix this.

1284
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,681
What are you talking about?

1285
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:02,017
I called my guy who does
crisis management.

1286
01:09:02,058 --> 01:09:03,560
He's the best in the business

1287
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:05,854
and he's willing to help you out
as a favor to me.

1288
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:08,815
The most important thing is
to jump on this right away.

1289
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,734
Protect your reputation.

1290
01:09:10,775 --> 01:09:13,319
You don't want something
like this to derail your career.

1291
01:09:13,945 --> 01:09:14,988
I can call him right now.

1292
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:23,078
No.

1293
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:27,500
Thanks Kam, I'll handle this
my own way.

1294
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:30,003
But not tonight.

1295
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:34,257
Tonight is about celebrating
and being with friends.

1296
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,759
Are you sure?

1297
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,801
More than ever.

1298
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:39,596
Okay, your call.

1299
01:09:39,637 --> 01:09:43,975
Um... so, do you wanna dance?

1300
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:51,107
If high school me could see
this moment right now,

1301
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:53,943
she would be so happy.

1302
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:55,820
Great, let's go.

1303
01:09:58,156 --> 01:10:00,658
You seem like a decent guy, Kam.

1304
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,622
The kind of guy that anyone
looking for someone

1305
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:08,500
who cares about perfection
and success

1306
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,669
would be thrilled to find.

1307
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,838
But I'm not that person anymore.

1308
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:18,301
I don't understand.

1309
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,847
I wanna be the kind of person
who takes a chance.

1310
01:10:22,889 --> 01:10:24,849
A chance on what?

1311
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:31,690
On telling someone else
that I feel something for them.

1312
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:37,737
And for once in my life not
doing something that's planned.

1313
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:06,558
So... do you think
that you might be able

1314
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,560
to find another dance partner?

1315
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:10,228
Oh, I'm good.

1316
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,230
I'm pretty sure I saw
Abbi Ferguson by the bar.

1317
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:25,452
Hey. It's speech time.

1318
01:11:25,493 --> 01:11:27,412
Uh... can it wait?

1319
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:29,581
No. We gotta be
out of here soon.

1320
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,750
Okay.

1321
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:40,884
Hello?

1322
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:43,136
Uh, hi. Can I please have
your attention?

1323
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:46,723
Welcome back Brookswood
class of 2007.

1324
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,684
I can't believe I am back
on this stage.

1325
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:54,981
Devin, I'm watching you.

1326
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:59,402
I just wanna thank you all
so much for working so hard

1327
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,237
to make this finally happen.

1328
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:09,162
We did it.
The cursed class is no more.

1329
01:12:19,756 --> 01:12:21,841
Hey. We're working
on the generators,

1330
01:12:21,883 --> 01:12:23,343
hopefully they'll be up soon.

1331
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,528
It's really coming down outside.

1332
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:25,887
The parking lot is covered.

1333
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:27,907
The city should be salting
and plowing soon though.

1334
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:30,642
So the safest thing for everyone
is to hunker down here

1335
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:32,435
and wait until it's over?

1336
01:12:32,477 --> 01:12:33,770
Yeah. We should look
for supplies

1337
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:35,612
in case it's a long night
or the pipes freeze.

1338
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,149
I have some flashlights
in the truck we could grab.

1339
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:40,776
Yeah.

1340
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:42,361
Okay.

1341
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,466
Looks like the curse wasn't done
with us quite yet.

1342
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,158
And we were so close.

1343
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:50,620
There's something
I need to tell you.

1344
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:54,124
Yeah. Uh, we don't have
to do this right now.

1345
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,668
You have a lot on
your mind already.

1346
01:12:58,378 --> 01:13:00,839
Yeah. Uh, yeah, it can...
it can wait.

1347
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:03,924
Okay.

1348
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:11,516
This is crazy.

1349
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:13,494
There's gotta be some blankets
or supplies

1350
01:13:13,518 --> 01:13:14,853
in one of these rooms.

1351
01:13:15,186 --> 01:13:17,188
At this point I'd be fine
with a breaker switch.

1352
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:36,791
Okay, I know we're not
students anymore,

1353
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,502
we're full-on adults.

1354
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:40,962
But it still kinda feels like

1355
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:42,422
we're not supposed
to be in here.

1356
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:44,132
Yeah.

1357
01:13:44,174 --> 01:13:48,553
And I always pictured this room
to be way less pathetic.

1358
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:50,179
Right?

1359
01:13:52,223 --> 01:13:54,267
Um, speaking of pathetic...

1360
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:57,187
I, um... lost my job tonight.

1361
01:13:58,396 --> 01:14:00,523
Maybe my whole career.

1362
01:14:00,565 --> 01:14:04,694
What?
Oh Elle, I'm so sorry.

1363
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
Psst!

1364
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:22,337
Katie? What are you doing?

1365
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,716
This spot, recognize it?

1366
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:32,931
Yeah. It's our spot.

1367
01:14:32,972 --> 01:14:36,518
We used to come here every day
between fourth and fifth period.

1368
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:38,728
Until Principal Holt busted us.

1369
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:45,526
Wow.

1370
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:50,115
I used to look forward
to that moment all day.

1371
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:51,324
Me too.

1372
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:54,876
I found this tonight
when I was getting ready.

1373
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,706
I haven't worn it in years.

1374
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:02,794
What are we doing?

1375
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:05,130
I don't know.

1376
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,093
I remember the old us
but who are we now?

1377
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:12,804
I think we need to be careful,
Jay.

1378
01:15:12,846 --> 01:15:16,224
Or we're gonna lose what we had-
what we have.

1379
01:15:17,642 --> 01:15:20,478
Yeah, it's like we became
work partners

1380
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:22,313
and forgot how to be
life partners.

1381
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:24,899
How do we fix that?

1382
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,695
We go to Paris.

1383
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:30,905
Jay, I'm serious.

1384
01:15:30,947 --> 01:15:32,032
I am too.

1385
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:35,219
We spend the first two weeks
of the new year

1386
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:38,329
doing something we should've
done a long time ago.

1387
01:15:38,371 --> 01:15:40,623
We focus on us.

1388
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:43,168
On our future outside
of the office.

1389
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:45,586
I love you.

1390
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:50,175
Then, now... and always.

1391
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,136
I love you too.

1392
01:15:57,015 --> 01:16:00,643
You know, that night
at winter formal,

1393
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:03,188
I was so jealous of you.

1394
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:06,358
You... you were?

1395
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,402
You got the crown.

1396
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:13,198
You were popular
and pretty and...

1397
01:16:14,532 --> 01:16:17,952
I just felt like... nothing.

1398
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:22,499
Sam, I...

1399
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,168
You know, I have spent
so much of my life

1400
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:28,046
looking for validation
from other people.

1401
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:32,384
It's exhausting and I don't
wanna do that anymore.

1402
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:35,053
And neither should you.

1403
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:40,350
There you are.
Sam... you got it.

1404
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:42,852
Got what?

1405
01:16:42,894 --> 01:16:43,853
Stan's assistant heard
from one of the legal associates

1406
01:16:43,895 --> 01:16:45,772
who saw an email from corporate.

1407
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:46,815
You got the job.

1408
01:16:47,857 --> 01:16:49,109
We're moving to New York!

1409
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,150
Really?

1410
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,029
Oh, I can't believe it!

1411
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:55,073
Ah! Yay!

1412
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:04,124
Ho, ho, ho!

1413
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:08,044
No fraternizing
on school property.

1414
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:11,798
I brought my engineering elves
to get the power back on

1415
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,262
just in the Saint... Nick...
of time, it seems.

1416
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:18,303
Yeah, we're just gonna...

1417
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:23,226
Ho, ho, ho!
Crazy kids.

1418
01:17:26,604 --> 01:17:27,897
Look at you two.

1419
01:17:27,939 --> 01:17:30,650
Still Brookswood's most epic
love story.

1420
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:33,403
Like I said, what a difference
15 years makes.

1421
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:35,905
No corsage?

1422
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:39,784
I need to find Devin.

1423
01:17:40,285 --> 01:17:41,953
Devin.

1424
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:44,355
I don't think I've seen him
since he got us the flashlights.

1425
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,167
I think he might've left.

1426
01:17:57,969 --> 01:17:59,804
- Hi Dad.
- Hey Sky.

1427
01:17:59,846 --> 01:18:01,598
Uh, just checking in.
You doing okay?

1428
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,099
I'm doing fine.

1429
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,602
But the school power outage
is all over social media.

1430
01:18:05,643 --> 01:18:07,103
What did you do now, Dad?

1431
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:11,691
Ha, ha, ha.
No, it's back on now but, um...

1432
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:13,276
I'm gonna head home.

1433
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,779
You're coming home already?
That's lame, even for you.

1434
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,989
Oh, thank you for that.

1435
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:21,368
Turns out I was right.
Reunions really aren't my thing.

1436
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:22,744
Did something happen?

1437
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:24,120
Oh, no, honey.

1438
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:25,639
It's just sometimes
things don't turn out

1439
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:27,499
the way you hoped they would.

1440
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:30,335
I'll see you soon.

1441
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:35,840
Well folks, the storm
is finally letting up.

1442
01:18:35,882 --> 01:18:37,717
The snowplows are out and about

1443
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:39,386
and it's time for us
to shut things down.

1444
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:42,430
So, get home safe everybody
and Merry Christmas.

1445
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,474
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1446
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:46,141
Elle?

1447
01:18:50,188 --> 01:18:51,356
Uh... hi.

1448
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:53,233
Um, please, please
don't leave quite yet.

1449
01:18:53,274 --> 01:18:56,736
You know, reunions are supposed
to give us a chance

1450
01:18:56,778 --> 01:19:01,533
to reminisce and relive
the good old days.

1451
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:05,829
This week I found myself
reflecting more on

1452
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:08,289
how I spent the last 15 years.

1453
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:12,752
And I realized that no matter
how many plans you make

1454
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,088
or goals you set,

1455
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,589
you can never fully
prepare yourself

1456
01:19:16,631 --> 01:19:18,466
for what's gonna happen.

1457
01:19:18,508 --> 01:19:21,052
You can't control it.

1458
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:25,473
There will be things that change
you inside and out,

1459
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:28,018
hopefully for the better.

1460
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:31,604
I'm not the same person
I was 15 years ago.

1461
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:33,356
None of us are.

1462
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:36,693
And that is a beautiful thing.

1463
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:40,030
'Cause I can't wait to see
what's next for all of us.

1464
01:19:41,031 --> 01:19:46,745
So, I think this reunion could
use one more song, right?

1465
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:49,956
Before we all go home
to celebrate the holidays

1466
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,000
with our families.

1467
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:55,086
Before we all go off
into what's next.

1468
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:59,632
And because there's
someone special

1469
01:19:59,674 --> 01:20:02,135
I haven't danced with yet...

1470
01:20:04,846 --> 01:20:06,389
Devin Ryan.

1471
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:10,518
Devin Ryan, please report
to the gym immediately.

1472
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:39,297
I thought you left.

1473
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:41,341
I almost did.

1474
01:20:42,717 --> 01:20:44,386
Well, I'm glad you didn't

1475
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:47,597
because I'm gonna need
a ride home tonight.

1476
01:20:50,642 --> 01:20:56,898
<i>I'm just so grateful that
you fell from up above...</i>

1477
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:57,774
<i>We're ready now...</i>

1478
01:20:57,816 --> 01:20:58,816
Thank you.

1479
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:00,526
For what?

1480
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:03,488
About a million things.

1481
01:21:05,323 --> 01:21:08,576
This reunion didn't go
as planned.

1482
01:21:08,618 --> 01:21:10,120
At all.

1483
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:16,584
But in the end, it couldn't
have gone better.

1484
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,925
<i>It's who we are...</i>

1485
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,969
<i>We're ready now...</i>

1486
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:27,929
<i>We're ready now...</i>

1487
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:30,015
<i>We're ready now...</i>

1488
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:43,319
<i>Together now...</i>

1489
01:21:43,361 --> 01:21:46,489
It wouldn't be winter formal
without a little surprise.

1490
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:47,699
Would it?

1491
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:50,368
<i>We can finally be
together now.</i>

1492
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,332
Don't worry, it's just paper.

1493
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:19,606
- You made it.
- Merry Christmas.

1494
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:21,375
My interview with
the governor ran long

1495
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:23,026
and then my train was delayed.

1496
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,402
Did I miss anything?

1497
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,172
No, no. No worries.
They're not even here yet.

1498
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:27,572
I was about to get us
some drinks.

1499
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:29,032
What can I get you?

1500
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:31,114
I'll have what you're having.
Just make it a double.

1501
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:33,203
Just a club soda for me.

1502
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:34,495
Wait...

1503
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,044
You guys!
I'm so happy for you.

1504
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:42,712
You're gonna be great parents.

1505
01:22:45,423 --> 01:22:45,965
Hey!

1506
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:46,883
Hi.

1507
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:48,385
Merry Christmas.

1508
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:52,430
I just ordered some champagne
and one sparkling water

1509
01:22:52,472 --> 01:22:54,599
because, guys, I have
some big news.

1510
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:58,186
Liv It Up rentals
just got a contract

1511
01:22:58,228 --> 01:23:01,398
for the biggest event
of next year.

1512
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:03,775
But the client is very demanding

1513
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:07,112
and I'm concerned that she might
just drive me crazy.

1514
01:23:08,279 --> 01:23:09,572
For the rest of my life.

1515
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:12,325
We're getting married.

1516
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:15,829
Yeah! Congratulations!

1517
01:23:19,582 --> 01:23:20,582
Hey.

1518
01:23:22,335 --> 01:23:23,837
A toast.

1519
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:26,798
To living our best lives and
sharing them with each other.

1520
01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:30,385
Cheers.
