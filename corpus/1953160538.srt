1
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,004
All right, boys, here we go!

2
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,673
So, Huntsie, I was wondering,

3
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:24,716
how long does it take you
to get your hair like that?

4
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,176
About four hours.

5
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:27,886
It's nice.

6
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:29,930
Smitty thinks you look
like Stevie Wonder on steroids...

7
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:32,641
- But I like it.
- Fuck you!

8
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,852
Look at that face pussy
that rookie gave you.

9
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:00,836
I think I nailed him.

10
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,865
Vicious slash
to the side of the head...

11
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,493
Doug! Get to work!

12
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:34,036
Ross Rhea!

13
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:39,458
It says here
that you have brown eyes.

14
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,626
Come on!

15
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,504
You actually have blue eyes
in real life.

16
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:45,506
I'm not paying anything! Fuck!

17
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,763
I'm really sorry, man.

18
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:54,431
Fuck...

19
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,936
- What's the problem, Jerry?
- I didn't win anything!

20
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:00,812
That's because it's a jukebox, Jerry.

21
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,837
- Nice.
- Thank you.

22
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:28,966
Mr. and Mrs. Goldsmith,
you guys look too young.

23
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,468
You have to bring your IDs next time.
Otherwise I'm not gonna let you in.

24
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:34,263
What the hell are you talking about?

25
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,474
Barbara, I'd like you
to meet Dr. and Mrs. Glatt.

26
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,602
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

27
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,396
And their doctor son, Ira.

28
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,983
- Hi. Great to meet you.
- Pleasure.

29
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:48,068
Oh, Albee, this is
my youngest son, Doug.

30
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:50,320
- Hello.
- Oh, sorry.

31
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,532
So, Ira, have you got
a main squeeze?

32
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:56,451
A handsome surgeon,
I bet you're batting them off.

33
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,579
My squeeze is late, actually.

34
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,330
Your dad thought you were single.

35
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,791
What do I know?

36
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,752
So, what Ivy League school
are you hiding at, Doug?

37
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:09,006
Doug did not follow
in the family vocation.

38
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,133
- He's...
- I bounce.

39
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,384
Like a basketball?

40
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,471
Richard!

41
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,307
Hi!

42
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,892
Very close friends.

43
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:24,521
That's quite the couple, Glatt.

44
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,231
Is he Jewish?

45
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,568
Come on, stop!

46
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:31,737
Stop blowing my hat, wind!

47
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,239
For the record,
they're both adopted.

48
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:45,709
Yes, there he is!
Oh, handsome bastard!

49
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,378
- Come on in! Come on in!
- Thanks.

50
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,633
Fuck, tell me you saw
what fucking Rhea did last night.

51
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:54,009
It was a pretty brutal chop.

52
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,927
I've fucking never seen Rhea
lose his shit like that before.

53
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,681
He got suspended
for 20 fucking games.

54
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,558
Boston sends him down
to St. John's.

55
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:02,893
He's 40 years old.

56
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,978
That's it.
He's fucking done, son!

57
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,189
All right, then.
Welcome to "Hot Ice."

58
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,232
Tonight, we have
Ross Rhea's apology.

59
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:12,903
To Daryl and his family,

60
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:15,822
I'm deeply sorry for what happened
out there, for what I did.

61
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,908
Jesus, look at him.
It's pathetic!

62
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,409
I have no excuse.

63
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:20,827
I don't...

64
00:04:20,952 --> 00:04:24,289
Jesus Christ.
I can't stomach this shit any more.

65
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,541
Fucking kills me
to see him like this.

66
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,169
I'll probably feature it
on next week's "Hot Ice"

67
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:32,005
unless that motherfucker Sully
from Worcester calls in again.

68
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,256
Like, last week, he called in

69
00:04:33,382 --> 00:04:35,258
pretending that he was
from some fucking sweepstakes,

70
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,885
and he told me
that I'd won the grand prize

71
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,679
of 50 cocks in my mouth.

72
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,014
He goes, I have the option
of sucking all 50 at once

73
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,102
or one a month
for 50 fucking months.

74
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:47,479
Fuck, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bring you down, pal.

75
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:48,855
Oh, no, no.

76
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,482
I...

77
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:52,401
I don't have a thing, you know?

78
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,112
Like, you have your show.

79
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:57,572
And my dad and my brother,

80
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,366
they have their doctor thing.

81
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,243
I don't got a thing.

82
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:05,122
Everybody's got something but me.

83
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:08,875
Would it help
that I want you inside me?

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,962
That I want you to make lemonade
in my chocolate factory?

85
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:15,048
Fuck this fucking sad shit!

86
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,300
Let's just go watch the Assassins
kick the shit out of Oshawa.

87
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:20,053
I'll fill your big, thick ass
full of fucking corndogs.

88
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:25,392
Fuck you, Oshawa!

89
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,478
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is only the first period.

90
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:31,523
I am predicting that this fucking game
becomes an absolute ass-raping

91
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,817
that only the likes
of fucking Ned Beatty

92
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:36,570
or, potentially, the cast of "Oz"
can comprehend.

93
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:37,946
Dougie, any thoughts?

94
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,240
This is fun.
These are tasty treats.

95
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,951
What the fuck is that shit?

96
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,703
- Get in the fucking box!
- Fuck you!

97
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:46,913
- Get in!
- Fuck yourself!

98
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,123
Bye-bye, bitch!

99
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,333
- Fuck you!
- Psycho!

100
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,918
Welcome to Orangetown, motherfucker!

101
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,920
What the fuck?

102
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,423
You want a fucking piece of me,
you little fucking faggot?

103
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:57,674
Hey, my brother's gay.

104
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,844
That's it! Fucking...

105
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,138
What the fuck is this?

106
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,389
Oh, shit. He's coming up here!

107
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,016
You fucking film me,
you little fucking faggot!

108
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,435
Hey, my brother's <i>GAY!</i>

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,603
Motherfucker!

110
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:11,813
Cw!

111
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,148
Oh!

112
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,694
Oh, attaboy, Dougie!
Kick his fucking head in!

113
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:24,826
Holy fucking shit!

114
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,495
Look at that face-period!

115
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,205
You see this over here?

116
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,915
You want to take
that word back, please?

117
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,666
Fuck you, faggot!

118
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:42,052
Yes!

119
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:43,762
Oh, my God!

120
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,972
Doug! Doug!

121
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,033
<i>One.</i>

122
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:08,995
That's my fuckin' boy!

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,288
Boner genocide!

124
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:14,918
I am pretty sure my fucking eyeballs
just ejaculated.

125
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,586
Pat, that's it.

126
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,922
Tonight we have a very special
fucking guest joining us...

127
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:22,926
Doug "The Thug" Glatt!

128
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,011
I'm a big fan.
It's a good show.

129
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:27,430
Speaking of fans,
let's go to the phones.

130
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:30,350
Caller, you're blowing hot ice.

131
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,686
Hi, there.
I was wondering if you like hot dogs.

132
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,937
That's...

133
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,898
- Yes, I like hot dogs.
- Great!

134
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,986
But I prefer corndogs
because you don't need a bun for it

135
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:44,614
because the bun is all around it,
and you can eat it from a stick.

136
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,284
You like hot dogs 'cause you like
big cocks in your mouth, son!

137
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,119
You motherfucker!

138
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,372
God-fucking-damn it!

139
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:55,166
Fuck you, Gus and Brian,
you motherfuckers!

140
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,335
You're supposed to screen this shit!

141
00:07:58,128 --> 00:07:59,754
Fuck this! I'm done!

142
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,214
I've had enough of you

143
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,508
and your fucking sweater-vest,
police-state censorship, okay?

144
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,762
Hi, there! You are the final caller ever
on "Hot Ice".

145
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,848
Oh, hi.
This is Rollie Hortense.

146
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,641
I'm the head coach
of the Orangetown Assassins.

147
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,852
- Yeah? Go fuck yourself.
- Patty, do me a favor.

148
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,813
Let me talk to your buddy there,
Doug, okay?

149
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:19,316
I'm calling because you impressed
the hell out of me last night,

150
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,443
and a lot of other people, too.

151
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,694
Thank you.

152
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:25,322
You impress me
a hell of a lot, too.

153
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:26,615
I'll be direct.

154
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,326
What I want you to do
is come down to the rink tomorrow,

155
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,119
come out there for a tryout.

156
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,164
You think about it, okay?
Tomorrow at 2:30.

157
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,334
Okay. Yeah.

158
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,754
I hope to see you there
tomorrow at 2:30.

159
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,590
Where?

160
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,552
Oh, you guys really shine
in the fucking morning!

161
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:51,848
Hey, kid!

162
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:54,351
Dougie!

163
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:55,936
Doug!

164
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:57,771
Come on out here, son.

165
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,272
Come on!

166
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:03,818
Who the fuck is this guy?

167
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,489
Jesus Christ!

168
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,075
Nice wheels, boy.

169
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,285
Stop being mean to my friend!

170
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,995
They're his gay brother's!

171
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,333
What, you never seen
figure skates before?

172
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,053
- Hey.
- Howdy.

173
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,555
Fuck!

174
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:36,351
I don't know what you
sweethearts are all laughing at.

175
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,727
One and nine,
last time I checked,

176
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:42,023
so shut the fuck up and let this guy
have his shot, all right?

177
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,652
Coach, you're not actually gonna let
this guy join the team.

178
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,155
You know you're not joining the fucking
Mouse Capades, right, buddy?

179
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,366
You're not trying out for the... the...

180
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,451
What? The... Capades.

181
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:54,744
Spit it out.

182
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,163
You're a big boy.
Use your big-boy words.

183
00:09:58,415 --> 00:09:59,624
Fuck it.

184
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,136
Shit! Oh, shit!

185
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,470
Motherfucker!

186
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:16,141
Cocksucker!

187
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:22,063
Jesus Christ.

188
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,232
Holy lick, boy!

189
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,400
It's just too bad

190
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,944
those are your teammates
that you fucked up out there.

191
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,446
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

192
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:30,655
Of course, on the bright side,

193
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,658
those are your teammates
that you fucked up out there.

194
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:35,869
What do you say, son?
You want to be an Assassin?

195
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:38,079
Yes, yes.

196
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,205
What number you want to wear?

197
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,415
69!

198
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,876
Take the number 69!

199
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,794
It's hilarious!

200
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,089
Is that number taken?

201
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,636
Dig it in now! Dig it in!

202
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:56,389
That's okay.
You got to be shitty to get better.

203
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:57,974
Push, push, push! There you go!

204
00:10:58,099 --> 00:10:59,809
You almost got it!
I don't care if you go down.

205
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,903
Glatt! Glatt!

206
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,488
Excuse me.

207
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:12,906
Shit!

208
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,367
Let's go, Doug!

209
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,456
Hey, Pretty good! Pretty good!

210
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,917
Way, Way, Way, way better!

211
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,218
Ross "The Boss" motherfucking Rhea.

212
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,845
He is the master.
All right, Fucking Guys Up 101.

213
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,931
- You see what Rhea's doing?
- Mm.

214
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,599
Grabbing onto the fucking meat
right there.

215
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:43,895
Nothing. Nothing's coming through,
and you're fucking tiring out.

216
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,438
Pow! Bam!

217
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:51,152
I lure you in
by beating the fuck out of you.

218
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,197
When you come in close
to stop the fucking onslaught...

219
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,074
Boom! Uppercut!

220
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,502
- $6,000 off!
- $5,000 off!

221
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,046
The Thug hates crappy cars!

222
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:24,185
Sorry, bud.

223
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,438
You're gonna fuck somebody up
real good, kiddo.

224
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,868
- Coach, you wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah. Hey, Doug.

225
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,495
Yeah, come on in. Grab a chair.

226
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,583
I got something
I want to discuss with you.

227
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,335
I am truly fucking proud of you.

228
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,130
I'm truly fucking proud of you.

229
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:56,217
Imagine if you played in a league
where they actually played hockey.

230
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,428
Your talent's wasted here.

231
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,638
I don't know if I have any talent.

232
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,975
You've been touched
by the fist of God, for Christ's sake!

233
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,476
Thank you, sir.

234
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,769
I got a brother, Ron.

235
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:09,814
He's the coach and general manager
of the Halifax Highlanders.

236
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:13,193
I've been telling him about you,
and I think you can really help him out.

237
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:16,571
It all starts
with this player he's got there,

238
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,281
Xavier LaFlamme.

239
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:21,159
Holy shit, could this guy
dance with the puck!

240
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:22,911
And he could put
that cocksucker away, too.

241
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,872
100% pure natural skill.

242
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,585
He ends up going
number two overall,

243
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,212
and Montreal grabs him.

244
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,088
Number one!

245
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,300
Fourth game of the season,
it's the home opener.

246
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:39,344
Bam!

247
00:13:40,011 --> 00:13:41,262
Ross "The Boss" Rhea.

248
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,639
Nice hit, eh?

249
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:44,557
Suffers
a third-degree concussion.

250
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,142
Actually, he's lucky
he wasn't fucking killed.

251
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:49,145
Time he comes back,
he's scared shitless out there.

252
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:53,733
And the pressure's really
starting to mount on this kid,

253
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:55,193
and he really can't hack it.

254
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,819
He starts missing practices.

255
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:58,738
He starts hanging
with the wrong people.

256
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:03,284
The rumors, the fuck tapes.
It all starts to add up.

257
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,453
So, that summer, he goes to the club,
says he wants a trade.

258
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,039
They're not gonna trade him.
They send him down... Halifax.

259
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:09,207
He's with my brother.

260
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:12,210
All right! That's about all
I can fucking stand, ladies!

261
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:15,546
You know why we're losing?
'Cause you're fucking shit!

262
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:18,174
Doug, he wants
to offer you a contract.

263
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,717
This is a farm club.

264
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:22,220
This is not some league
where you're playing on a team

265
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,013
that's named after
a fucking radio station.

266
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,391
This is one step
under the big league.

267
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:28,393
You go there.
You watch Frenchie's back.

268
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,019
Maybe you could snap him
out of his slump.

269
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,438
Maybe you can snap
that whole team awake.

270
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:33,648
Thank you so much!

271
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,693
You don't got to thank me.
This is a great opportunity.

272
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:39,320
- I'm so glad you see that.
- Did you draw that?

273
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,571
- What?
- The wolf.

274
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,907
- Yeah, of course.
- What's its name?

275
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,659
Loopy.

276
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,036
Frame it and you can remember
your days as an Assassin.

277
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:49,497
Thanks for Loopy, Coach.

278
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,708
My cousin Sherilyn,
she works for this titty bar

279
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,751
up in Dartmouth
called fucking Night Court.

280
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,586
And she has this
dance move she does

281
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,714
where she drags
her fucking jagged little coke nail

282
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,215
across her C-section scars.

283
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,093
She's been asking me to come up
and watch her dance for ages,

284
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,428
and I've been kind of telling her,

285
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:05,722
"That's kind of gross
'cause we're family."

286
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:07,348
But I don't actually find it that gross.

287
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,684
- This is me here.
- This one?

288
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,477
Dougie...

289
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:13,896
beat the shit
out of some jagoffs for me.

290
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:16,357
I'm gonna be okay, right?

291
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,650
You're the fucking Thug!

292
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,444
You're gonna be
wicked fucking awesome!

293
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:20,945
I love you, bud.

294
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,072
- I'll miss you, buddy.
- I'll miss you.

295
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:24,699
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

296
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:25,867
There he goes!

297
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,745
That's my friend!
I know Doug "The Thug" Glatt!

298
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,121
I remember when his dick

299
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,749
was a tiny, little
fucking Christmas light!

300
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,304
Halifax! Halifax!

301
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,785
Hello?

302
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:10,995
Jesus!

303
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,836
Hello?

304
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,296
Fuck!

305
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,093
- Oh.
- Did I miss a spot?

306
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,303
I'm sorry. Nice to meet you.

307
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:29,514
- Close the fucking door!
- Thank you for having me.

308
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:50,034
Jesus, it's early!

309
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,203
- I'm Doug Glatt.
- Gord Ogilvey.

310
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,122
Nice to meet you.

311
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:59,419
So, Dougie, you're the tough Yank
who beats the shit out of everyone.

312
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:00,670
I don't know about that.

313
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:02,004
Glad to have you here, bud.

314
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,464
Thanks. I'm happy to be here.

315
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,675
Oh, fuck!
Yeah, my wife left me.

316
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,136
Said she was sick of hockey.

317
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,763
Sick of hockey...

318
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,181
I'm... sorry?

319
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:13,850
Well, it's pretty much the shitter.

320
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:19,814
No, thanks. Oh, so nice of you.
No, I'm good. Thanks.

321
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,149
This here is Stevesie.

322
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,568
Anything you need,
you tell me, he'll do it.

323
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:25,319
Don't hesitate.
Good to meet you.

324
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,572
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Glug Datt. Doug Glatt.

325
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:30,992
That's Parkey, left winger.
Paying for his med school.

326
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,994
Asians are an industrious people.

327
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,037
I guess hockey is like math to him.

328
00:17:35,163 --> 00:17:38,875
Icing the pucks are like equations,
eh, Parkey?!

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,460
Where's my fucking helmet?!

330
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,295
Starting goalie Marco Belchior.

331
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,547
Call him Belchie.
He's from Regina.

332
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:46,841
- Vagina?
- He drinks a lot of hand sanitizer.

333
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,135
What's so fucking funny, giggly bits?

334
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:53,264
- We have your mama here.
- Oh, yes!

335
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,099
Look at this beautiful smile!

336
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,809
- There she is!
- Say hello.

337
00:17:56,934 --> 00:18:00,354
Oh! Skull-fuck your mother!

338
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,106
- What? Yes!
- Oh, hump her head!

339
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:03,691
Just like a Belchie!

340
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,194
You fucking Chernobyl
motherfuckers!

341
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,654
Your mother's pussy's
so fucking tight!

342
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,656
No way a baby come out there!

343
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,950
No way! You adopted!

344
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,120
I'm on your team!
Does anybody else see this shit?

345
00:18:16,245 --> 00:18:17,455
- Oh, what a woman!
- Your turn.

346
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,789
I love you, Mama.

347
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,083
You might want to wash it
before you put on.

348
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,919
- Hi, I'm Doug Glatt.
- Doni.

349
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:24,670
Two rules, man.

350
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:26,797
Stay away
from my fucking Percocets,

351
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:28,883
and do you have
any fucking Percocets, man?

352
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,510
- All right.
- Okay!

353
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:32,428
What about LaFlamme?
Where's he at?

354
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,723
Probably giving some single mother
herpes in a parking lot.

355
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,016
Oh, sure.

356
00:18:41,062 --> 00:18:42,647
Yo.

357
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,899
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,443
This the shit right here.

359
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:51,864
Yeah, this makes me
want to kill somebody.

360
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,951
Turn this shit up.

361
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,702
Real fucking loud.

362
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:07,338
Okay, boys, let's go flat out!

363
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:09,924
Give it 121% tonight!

364
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:44,875
Well, that was
borderline treasonous

365
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:49,213
and a disgrace to our nation
and its proud and storied history.

366
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,340
My father didn't kick the Nazis'...

367
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,593
And the puck drops!
Face-off win by Hamilton.

368
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:55,052
Schaffer chips it back to Hall.

369
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,555
Here's Jefferson of the Steelers
in front of the net.

370
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,015
Gets a chance, takes the shot!

371
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,224
Shutout tonight, man!

372
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,435
Save, Belchior!
Now Sacco dishes to Ogilvey.

373
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,980
LaFlamme still looking
to find his game.

374
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,441
Ogilvey to LaFlamme.
Oh, he dodged a bullet there!

375
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,735
Oh, come on, LaFlamme!
Grow a set!

376
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,280
Come on, boys!
Work those corners!

377
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:15,823
Let's keep it together!

378
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,160
- Don't pinch!
- Halifax pinches in...

379
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,494
Center! Center!

380
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,872
Johnson gets it over.

381
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:24,081
Here's the shot! He scores!

382
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,417
Oh, fuck!

383
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,419
- Belchie, five hole!
- Five hole!

384
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,963
Ass-licker!
Am I the only one here?

385
00:20:31,088 --> 00:20:34,800
You Slavic fucking borscht-blooded,
cabbage-headed motherfuckers, man!

386
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:38,012
Why don't you stop the puck
in your big vagina,

387
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,222
you Russian lesbian?

388
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,558
Get your heads out of your ass, eh?
Jesus!

389
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,101
Come on, boys!

390
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:46,854
Man on, Kimmy! Man on!

391
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,397
Now Kim goes into the corner.

392
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:53,444
- Clean hit. Clean hit.
- Come on! What the fuck?!

393
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,446
He won't be heard from till next week!

394
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,366
You got to make that call, ref!
That's a fucking elbow, Howard!

395
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,202
The doctor needs a doctor.

396
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,371
Bullshit!

397
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,461
Okay, number six, you light him up.

398
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,259
Look, I got it.

399
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:18,928
Just... Get lost. I got it.

400
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,137
Looks like Ronnie Hortense

401
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:23,140
is looking for a little spark
to ignite his team.

402
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:25,851
And that spark
is in the person of Doug Glatt,

403
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:27,853
and what a spark he'll be!

404
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:31,399
Come on, you fucking pussy!

405
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,651
- I got him.
- Come on!

406
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,403
Who the fuck are you?

407
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,239
What's up, bitch?
You want some?

408
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:42,326
Knock him out.

409
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:44,286
Come on, Dougie!

410
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,883
Ho, doctor! What a debut!

411
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,262
Attaboy, Dougie! Attaboy!

412
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:03,472
Fucking right!

413
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,282
<i>Thank you.</i>

414
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,745
<i>You're welcome.</i>

415
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:33,753
Did you know that cows only meow when
people are around?

416
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:36,714
- It's true.
- I read that in "Cat Fancy".

417
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,382
GORD What are these doing here?

418
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,385
Gone!

419
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,681
Here's a little dose.
Little dose.

420
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:47,767
Here we are!

421
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:49,810
It's time to welcome...

422
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,103
Hi, guys.

423
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:52,396
- Doug.
- Doug.

424
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:53,773
- Yeah.
- Officially.

425
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:56,108
Through an initiation.
It's gonna be good.

426
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,319
So, what do I have to do?

427
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,946
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

428
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:02,823
Sleep peaceful, old wanderer.

429
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,742
We should sign his dick.

430
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,118
Everyone sign his dick.

431
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:08,245
- What's happening here?
- What's the matter?

432
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,456
You have a little puss-puss?

433
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:12,750
Mommy whipped up
a pussy pot pie?

434
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,544
- Let's see what's going on over there.
- Show us your dick.

435
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,464
- I don't want you to see my dick.
- Why you being gay?

436
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:21,091
I think you're fucking being pretty gay.

437
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:23,385
- It's not gay!
- Not if you're brothers.

438
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:26,597
If you're brothers, it's gay
with a fucking dash of something else.

439
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,224
My brother's gay,
and he doesn't even do that.

440
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:29,391
I've been playing hockey
my whole life.

441
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,602
I never fucking signed
no one's dick, man.

442
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:32,812
I'll sign your dick, Doug.

443
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:41,695
Oh, come on! Fuck!
You fucked the carpet!

444
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,198
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can take my shoes off, yeah?

445
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,617
No, no, it's fine.
Who gives a fuck?

446
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:48,661
Thanks.

447
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:51,330
Excuse me.

448
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:53,207
Hey!

449
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,335
Come on, sit.

450
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,254
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

451
00:23:58,379 --> 00:23:59,797
Thanks.

452
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,298
That's cool.

453
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:02,758
Pot?

454
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:05,594
No. Thank you so much
for asking me.

455
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:08,597
Beer and soup, that's my thing.

456
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:11,767
You're a crazy motherfucker?

457
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:15,062
<i>Tabarnac!</i> Bam!
You fucking beat him.

458
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,438
- Really?
- Yeah!

459
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:17,606
Thank you.

460
00:24:17,731 --> 00:24:20,651
Yeah! Why did you do that?

461
00:24:20,776 --> 00:24:22,570
What do you mean?

462
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,822
Why do you help and protect
these guys?

463
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,282
You don't even know these guys.

464
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,951
Well, Coach puts me out there to fight.

465
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,036
That's my job.

466
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,914
I like standing up for my team,
you know?

467
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,125
Take care of...

468
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:41,839
"Team"!

469
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:44,717
You just wait. Wait one month.

470
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:48,053
Then you tell me if you feel the same.
I don't think so.

471
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:49,972
The fucking team!

472
00:24:53,142 --> 00:24:54,727
What are those?

473
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:57,521
Have you ever jerked off on ecstasy?

474
00:24:57,646 --> 00:24:58,647
I'm sorry?

475
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:02,693
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

476
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:07,740
Come on, boys! Let's go!
Fresh sheet of ice. Breathe it in!

477
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:10,075
Come on! Breathe in that fresh air.
Come on!

478
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,535
You're men! Men!

479
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,370
So, the penalty winding down

480
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,122
in front of a good crowd

481
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,333
here in this game
between the Laval Kings and...

482
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,835
Here we go, boys! Here we go!

483
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,295
Come on, Dougie!

484
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,671
Steve-O, go out for Dougie.

485
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:24,214
I got it! I got it!
Coach, I'm doing it!

486
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,800
- Two on one, man. Two on one!
- Doug, come off!

487
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,261
No, no, Steve-O.
Get back, get back!

488
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:31,055
Fuck!
He's got his hand up already.

489
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,599
It's gonna be too many men on the ice.

490
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,726
Here come the Kings
with a man advantage.

491
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,144
Delayed penalty.

492
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,604
They score!

493
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:41,732
Jesus and the donkey
mother-fucked it on!

494
00:25:41,857 --> 00:25:43,442
Get off the ice, Glatt!

495
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:46,320
Why are you
on the fucking ice, man?

496
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,322
I've heard this song before, folks.

497
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,949
In fact, on my wedding night.

498
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,325
Glatt, go to the end of the bench.

499
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,954
Our bashful bride Glatt
can't wear white any more.

500
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,039
You know why there was
too many men on the ice?

501
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:59,333
'Cause you stayed on the ice.
Come on, change it up. Let's go.

502
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:02,503
- Stay there until I tell you to move.
- Idiot.

503
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:03,921
Unbelievable, Glatt.

504
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:06,507
Nice work, rookie.
Come on, let's go!

505
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,967
Fuck!

506
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:10,135
That was the closest we have come

507
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,888
to winning a fucking hockey game
in over a month,

508
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:14,473
and you just fucked us!

509
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:16,266
You fucked us!

510
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:19,269
You're not here to play hockey, Glatt.
You're here to fight.

511
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,774
Hey, pretty boy,
you find that funny?

512
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,109
Funny ha ha?

513
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:28,112
Like flushing-a-$5 million-contract-
up-your-nose funny?

514
00:26:28,237 --> 00:26:31,073
Or funny peculiar like Doug there?

515
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,159
You get your shit together.

516
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:36,829
'Cause your shit stinks,
Pepé Le Pew.

517
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,539
It fucking stinks.

518
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,437
After serving
his 20-game suspension,

519
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:05,065
Ross "The Boss" Rhea was sent down
to Boston's affiliate in the EMHL,

520
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,442
the St. John's Shamrocks...

521
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,736
the same team
where he started his storied career,

522
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,363
a career a lot of people
believe is coming to a close.

523
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:14,074
This is where I started out.
This is where I'm from.

524
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,827
I suppose this is as good a place
as any for me to end up.

525
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:18,203
Rhea is a repeat offender,

526
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,789
having sat out 12 games
after his infamous head-shot

527
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:23,333
on Xavier LaFlamme
three years ago.

528
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:25,335
The league is sending
a clear message

529
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:27,463
that it will no longer
tolerate this behavior.

530
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:30,090
No, yeah, no.
You're breaking up.

531
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,717
No, we're not breaking up.

532
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:34,136
You're breaking up.
I can't hear...

533
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,640
What? No, I'm here.

534
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,726
What? No, it's still shit.

535
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:43,771
You still sound like a fucking cyborg.

536
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,356
How? You're in China.

537
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:48,317
No, I'm sorry. Fuck!

538
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,694
I said we'll talk tomorrow.

539
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:53,322
Me, too.

540
00:27:53,447 --> 00:27:56,450
Fuck, I need a drink!

541
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,702
Eva? Hey, Eva baby.

542
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:01,371
Are you on a date with this loser?

543
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:04,041
Mind if I cut in
with my beautiful dong?

544
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,960
Oh, fuck! What the fuck?!

545
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,297
You moron!

546
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,966
Here. You can use this
like a towel to dry off.

547
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,638
It's made from the same material
they make snowsuits out of.

548
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:37,699
Man, I'm wasted.

549
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:40,369
Eva, I really like your name.

550
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:42,454
Yes, sir. It's a great name.

551
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,956
Like the Bible,

552
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,750
just with a bit more,
kind of, mustard on it.

553
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:50,671
I think it's a pretty name,
like your face.

554
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,048
You got a pretty name
and a pretty face.

555
00:28:53,173 --> 00:28:56,301
You're very nice to me.

556
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:02,182
Fuck it.

557
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,433
Doug.

558
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,435
I dig hockey players.

559
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:08,981
This shit... the violence,
the beer, all of it...

560
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:11,316
I fucking love it.

561
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:14,403
- Sad.
- Fuck off.

562
00:29:14,528 --> 00:29:16,572
- Want to get out of here?
- Yes, please.

563
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:19,283
- Let's rally.
- Go on home.

564
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,578
You're so pretty.

565
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:23,954
You're so beautiful.

566
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,542
I'm sorry. It's... I keep saying that.
I'm sorry.

567
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,128
It's fine. I think it's cute.

568
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:34,840
Who doesn't like being told
they're beautiful?

569
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:37,801
Mm, this is me.

570
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:39,136
Okay.

571
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:42,347
I like Eva.

572
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:43,724
You do, eh?

573
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,559
Yes, ma'am.

574
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:48,270
Eva likes Doug.

575
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,647
Eva likes you.

576
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:54,193
What does Eva think about kissing?

577
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,738
- Which type?
- French?

578
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,122
Oh, fuck!

579
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,585
Hey...

580
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,921
what do you think about me
calling you sometime?

581
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,798
I don't know
whether that's the best idea.

582
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:17,966
Shit.

583
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:20,636
Why don't you give me your number,

584
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:22,679
and I promise that I'll never call you.

585
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:23,972
Yeah?

586
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:25,432
Yeah.

587
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,767
Okay.

588
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:32,272
Perfect.

589
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:35,943
I love that!

590
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,570
Bye, Doug.

591
00:30:38,695 --> 00:30:39,655
Bye, Eva.

592
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,408
I'm gonna watch you walk up the stairs
to make sure that you're safe.

593
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,036
Safe.

594
00:30:46,161 --> 00:30:47,663
- Good night.
- Good night.

595
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,090
All right, boys, listen up!
We're still in this thing.

596
00:30:58,215 --> 00:30:59,841
We just need a quick one.

597
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:01,051
Listen up, cash!

598
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,803
We got to work harder
than them, okay?

599
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,304
Get harder than them, guys.

600
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,307
You know what's hard work?
Going through a divorce.

601
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,767
She's trying to get all my money now.

602
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:10,727
She can have half of it.
I don't give a shit.

603
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:13,188
The other half... hard work, mine!

604
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,440
Some guys on their team
are fucking divorced.

605
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:17,567
Three guys there
whose fucking marriages

606
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:18,777
are in the fucking toilet.

607
00:31:18,902 --> 00:31:20,529
- We're playing divorced guys.
- Yeah.

608
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:24,032
We got to be fucking
triceps, biceps, R-ceps hard!

609
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:25,242
Hard!

610
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:28,704
Greek fucking
underground gay-porn hard!

611
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,247
You're all Adonises.

612
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:32,666
Highlanders, gay-porn hard!

613
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,209
Gay-porn hard!

614
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,711
Wheelers win the face-off.

615
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:37,004
It goes back to Emerson.

616
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:39,840
Emerson moves up the wing.
Looks across, finds Jones.

617
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,550
Jones now flips it up
the right side.

618
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:43,927
Stevenson! Here's Mason.
Works it up the boards.

619
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:46,179
Gets it over to Gill.
He scored!

620
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,556
Where's the pride?

621
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:48,890
Yeah!

622
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:51,935
Nobody wants to play?
Nobody wants to play.

623
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,729
LaFlamme.

624
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,732
I'm sorry, Coach.

625
00:31:56,857 --> 00:32:00,110
Okay, Siegfried. Let's go, Roy!
Eye of the fucking tiger!

626
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,195
Ogilvey wins the face-off,

627
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,447
takes it back into his own zone.

628
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:07,826
Now circling in the neutral zone,
looking for room.

629
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:10,287
For fuck's sake, kid,
stop staring at me.

630
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,247
- You're really weirding me out, eh?
- I'm sorry, sir.

631
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:14,166
Here comes LaFlamme,

632
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,792
trying to squeeze by a check.

633
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:17,336
You fucking diver!

634
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:18,962
- Come on!
- Come on!

635
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,547
That better be four minutes, ref.

636
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,802
- You're dead meat!
- Fuck off!

637
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,055
Hey, Glatt, you little fucking dickweed!

638
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,682
You try any of that shit you did
against Hamilton on me,

639
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,267
I'll light your fucking ass up.

640
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:36,104
Hey! I'll light your ass
back up on fire.

641
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:41,360
It's time to make up for your mistake.
Look at the penalty clock.

642
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:43,403
And when I say, you get over there,

643
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,989
stand in front of that box,
and wait for that ugly bugger.

644
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:47,282
Yes, sir.

645
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,034
Do exactly what I say.

646
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,327
Yes, sir, of course.

647
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:53,538
Exactly what I say. You got it?
Nothing else.

648
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,291
Windsor moves
the puck out of their zone.

649
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:59,753
Penalty's winding down.
Here's Patrick, intended for Black.

650
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,463
That's broken up by York,
knocked it out of the air.

651
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:04,383
And now it comes off the backboard.
It's brought right back...

652
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:07,886
Kimmy, get off! Get off!
Go, go, go, go! Skate!

653
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:10,222
Go, Glatt. Don't deviate!
Exactly like I said.

654
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,518
- You want a fucking piece of me?
- Hi.

655
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:18,313
You fucking pussy.
I am gonna fuck you up, Glatt!

656
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:19,523
Fuck you!

657
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,942
You fucking take it,
you motherfucker!

658
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,944
You... little... bitch!

659
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,821
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Glatt.

660
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,322
Fucking hit him!

661
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:43,171
Get in there! Get in there!

662
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:48,176
All right, Dougie!

663
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,013
Okay, Glatt, keep moving.

664
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:53,890
Keep moving. Get in the box.

665
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,267
Keep it moving.

666
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:05,360
But I just miss you.

667
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:07,154
I really miss you both.

668
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,906
Please don't give up on me.

669
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,454
Oh, fuck me.

670
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,289
Hello?

671
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:20,292
Eva? Hey!

672
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:23,670
This is Doug... Glatt.

673
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,382
Your number is so similar
to my friend's number.

674
00:34:27,507 --> 00:34:29,009
I didn't know which was which,

675
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:32,846
so I didn't want to call my friend
and then bother you.

676
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:34,639
I was just checking.

677
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:37,976
Simply checking the numbers out.

678
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:40,896
Hey, listen, I'm at the bar
with my team.

679
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:43,231
I think some of your friends
are gonna come.

680
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:46,401
I don't know if you want to,
like, you know, join us.

681
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,904
Actually, I've been trying
to cut my drinking down.

682
00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:51,781
Trying to be a good girl.
Trying.

683
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:53,325
Well, you know...

684
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,244
maybe you and I could
hang out sometime,

685
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:58,997
you know, get, like, coffee?

686
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:02,083
Sure.

687
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:04,836
Great.

688
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:08,006
I don't drink coffee,
but I like Gatorade,

689
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:10,550
and I like power drinks
and water.

690
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:11,718
Awesome.

691
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,137
It doesn't even matter
if I'm thirsty or not,

692
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:15,555
if I could just see you.

693
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,641
That sounds cool.

694
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:18,934
Okay.

695
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:20,936
Okay, I'll see you then.

696
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:23,688
- Bye, Eva.
- Bye.

697
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,482
Yes!

698
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:31,488
Oh, you pinko
Bolshevik ass-eaters, man!

699
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:33,281
It is beach ball

700
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:37,160
because you cannot even
stop a fucking beach ball.

701
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:38,495
Not nice!

702
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,915
Beach ball is bigger than puck.
That's why joke is.

703
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,917
Yeah, I fucking get it, man.

704
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,795
Left to right, we know that.

705
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,004
Shut up!

706
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:51,174
So, the score
is tied with 2:52 left.

707
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,927
Steve-O, Steve-O, Steve-O,
come on!

708
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,679
No, no, no, sit down. Sit down.

709
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,138
Glatt!

710
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:00,350
- Who do I fight, Coach?
- You're not fighting anybody.

711
00:36:00,475 --> 00:36:03,186
Just park your ass in front of that
goaltender and screen him, okay?

712
00:36:03,311 --> 00:36:05,313
Let's do this.
Don't be a pussy.

713
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,066
Get that big ass right in front of him.
Block the lane.

714
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:10,986
- Fuck!
- Let's go! Let's go!

715
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:13,321
Oh, The Thug
is coming in on a power play.

716
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:16,157
Do you believe in miracles?

717
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:17,450
Thank you.

718
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,660
Let's go, let's go!

719
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:19,828
And the puck is dropped.

720
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:21,580
Glatt will head
straight to the front of the net.

721
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:24,082
Puck goes back to the point.
Here's Kim with it.

722
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:26,835
Gets it over. They take another look.
Put out in front.

723
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,421
Glatt is screening.
All the action in front of the net.

724
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:31,715
Halifax winds it up.
Here's a blast!

725
00:36:34,968 --> 00:36:36,344
Kim scored!

726
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:38,471
A power-play goal.

727
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,849
Takes the lead 3-2.

728
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:47,230
I don't think the Moncton goalie
saw any part of that.

729
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,399
There was nothing
but a wall of Glatt.

730
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:51,651
Come on, boys!
10 seconds left now.

731
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,321
Keep the wolves
out of the barn, man. 8 seconds!

732
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:55,780
Now Ferris
shoots it up the boards.

733
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:57,115
It goes there to Lemieux.

734
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,867
Oh, this guy's
going glove, Mommy.

735
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,327
This guy's going glove, Mother.

736
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,246
Lemieux gets in
across the line, takes the shot.

737
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:06,416
Oh, great save!
Horatio at the bridge!

738
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,419
The game is over!

739
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:12,047
Halifax has broken the losing streak.

740
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:13,923
Their first win in a month.

741
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,550
What a show!

742
00:37:15,675 --> 00:37:19,763
I'm gonna go crack some champagne
and make love to my old lady.

743
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:23,308
It'll be the first time, the best time,
in a long time.

744
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:25,894
That was fucking hockey, man!

745
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,563
Oh, thank you. That's so nice.

746
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,790
Hey! Hi, Eva.

747
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,249
You look so pretty.

748
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,796
I just have to go
to the washroom a sec.

749
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:55,340
Yeah. Okay.

750
00:38:00,762 --> 00:38:02,305
Can I get a Gatorade?

751
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,685
Hey. Had to go potty?

752
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:09,938
Look...

753
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:11,981
I liked making out with you.
It was fun.

754
00:38:12,107 --> 00:38:14,818
But what happened
between us the other night,

755
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:16,111
it was a one-off.

756
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,612
I'm sorry.

757
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:20,323
I mean, Jesus,
all we did was make out.

758
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,867
Anyway, it was a mistake.

759
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:26,788
You're actually... nice,

760
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,873
and I'm a huge bitch.

761
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,583
Eva! Don't say that.

762
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,253
I'm a very bad girlfriend.

763
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:34,796
Girlfriend?

764
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,464
Yeah.

765
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,967
I have a boyfriend,
which is awesome.

766
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:40,135
Fuck!

767
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,929
Jeez.

768
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:47,517
Well, I guess,
it'd be kind of weird

769
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:50,019
if I gave you these flowers...

770
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:51,438
Oh, man!

771
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,189
These chocolates...

772
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,485
and this stuffed animal.
It's a little doll.

773
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,531
It's not really a stuffed animal.
It's a stuffed Angus.

774
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,783
It's the mascot
of the team I play for...

775
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,452
the Halifax Highlanders.

776
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:09,038
It's just a little toy...
but it's official.

777
00:39:09,164 --> 00:39:11,499
For fuck's sake!

778
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:13,209
No! It's hilarious.

779
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,588
It's a simple misunderstanding,
you know?

780
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:17,922
I'm fine.

781
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:19,340
Okay. Bye, Eva.

782
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,093
Bye, Doug.

783
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:24,429
It's official, the mascot.

784
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:28,600
Fuck.

785
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:38,818
Oh...

786
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,657
Fuck me, Angus.

787
00:39:48,328 --> 00:39:50,622
It's not the first time that wind
blew garbage in my face.

788
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:54,000
One time, my friends built this
bike ramp behind a medical center.

789
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,503
It was really windy that day,
so I started pedaling really fast,

790
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,296
and as I was going up the ramp,

791
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:01,925
wind blew, like, these bloody rags,
like, right into my face,

792
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,510
and I crashed into the dumpster

793
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,720
and I started, like, rolling around
into, like, the medical waste

794
00:40:05,845 --> 00:40:07,388
'cause I was so disoriented.

795
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:10,391
I broke my ankle,
like, in three places,

796
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:12,602
and the worst part was
there was this big bag of pee,

797
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:16,731
and I rolled over on it,
and it, like, burst all over me.

798
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:24,739
So, you think it's funny, too?

799
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,491
Yes! Very much so.

800
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,326
Garbage blows in my face sometimes.

801
00:40:34,123 --> 00:40:36,543
Thanks for the ride.
It was good to see you.

802
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:41,506
Doug...

803
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,438
Right. My boyfriend.

804
00:40:58,565 --> 00:40:59,566
Bye, Eva.

805
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:01,442
Bye, Doug.

806
00:41:51,618 --> 00:41:52,869
Let's go, boys!

807
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:54,203
Go get 'em, Dougie!

808
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:56,372
Douglas Menahem Glatt!

809
00:41:58,124 --> 00:42:01,252
Pret... Pret... Pretzel, bitches!

810
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:03,087
Hey! What the hell?

811
00:42:03,212 --> 00:42:04,797
Recognize!

812
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,758
Of course I recognize you!

813
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:09,260
You recognize this big fucking
beautiful family of yours?

814
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,262
Oh, my God, this is amazing!
I'm so happy!

815
00:42:11,387 --> 00:42:12,972
Glatt! What are you fucking doing,
motherfucker?

816
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,891
Start skating. Shave some ice.

817
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,309
Yeah. Love you guys.

818
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:17,810
We love you, Dougie!

819
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,105
Hey, he can skate!

820
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,357
What's that on his shirt, eh?

821
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,817
It says your name.
It says your fucking name on the back.

822
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,778
Language! Do you mind, Pat?

823
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:28,363
He can't stop.
It's like Tourette's.

824
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:29,697
I'm sorry.

825
00:42:29,822 --> 00:42:30,823
Hey, want to go?

826
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,784
Yeah, okay.

827
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:34,452
- Good luck, man.
- Good luck to you, too, bud.

828
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:35,787
The puck drops,

829
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:37,830
and, yes, we are gonna have
a dustup.

830
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:40,541
Oh, kick his fucking ass, Dougie!

831
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:47,423
Punch for punch,
neither giving an inch!

832
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:48,633
Both still on their feet.

833
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:50,343
Right, left, right, left!

834
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,679
- Both going at it. Both landing blows.
- Nail him, Doug.

835
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,597
To the head,
to the body, everywhere!

836
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:57,892
Oh, my... Fuck!

837
00:42:58,017 --> 00:42:59,560
Oh, God.

838
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,107
That's it! That's it!

839
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:06,484
- Good fight, man.
- Good fight.

840
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,319
He's a nice guy.

841
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,699
Do you hear that?

842
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,541
Just 1:04 left, score is tied.

843
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,042
Everything on the line here

844
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,004
as Halifax looks to extend
their winning streak to four.

845
00:43:26,129 --> 00:43:27,088
I'm open!

846
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:28,131
Now a three-on-one develops.

847
00:43:28,256 --> 00:43:29,590
Net, Doug! Net!

848
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:32,010
Kim lets the shot go!
Hits Glatt. He scored!

849
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,098
It was Doug Glatt
in the conservatory with his ass!

850
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:41,978
And the young gun from Orangetown
they call The Thug has done it.

851
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:43,396
Holy shit!

852
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,647
And the Highlanders

853
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:48,568
look like they might just make a run
for the playoffs after all.

854
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,945
You make me happy, man!
With your ass!

855
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,488
- My ass.
- With your ass!

856
00:43:52,613 --> 00:43:53,614
My ass!

857
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:58,786
Doug, Doug!

858
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:03,332
Well done, boys!

859
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:06,085
Tonight...
good food, good women, good rest.

860
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,838
Not necessarily in that order.

861
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:10,673
Glatt! LaFlamme!

862
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:13,134
Get changed. In my office.

863
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:14,969
Good job, boys.
See you tomorrow morning.

864
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:16,721
Way to go, Dougie!

865
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:18,473
This boy popped a cherry tonight.

866
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:20,683
Popped my cherry.
What does that mean?

867
00:44:22,602 --> 00:44:23,770
Boys.

868
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,021
Coach.

869
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:27,899
Well, one of you
has really been impressing me

870
00:44:28,024 --> 00:44:31,235
with your play lately,
and one of you hasn't.

871
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,489
Either one of you want to venture
to guess as to who's who?

872
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,577
Okay, well, LaFlamme,
I'm ripping that "A" off your jersey.

873
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:41,537
You don't deserve it,
unless "A" stands for asshole,

874
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:43,414
which is the way you've been playing.

875
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:45,208
Glatt, you're promoted.

876
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:48,544
Assistant captain. Good on you.
Keep up the good work.

877
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:51,380
There's the game puck.
I'm proud of you.

878
00:44:51,506 --> 00:44:52,548
Thanks, Coach.

879
00:44:52,673 --> 00:44:56,094
Xavier, you can take this the right way
or the wrong way, son.

880
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:57,261
Lady's choice.

881
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:01,099
Xavier.

882
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:02,892
Go get him.

883
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:04,060
Hey, bud, wait up.

884
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:06,354
Oh, my God, you scored!

885
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:08,856
Your fucking ass scored!

886
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:11,818
You son of a bitch!
Look at you!

887
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,820
You're gonna
love this restaurant.

888
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,613
I know how you like
Middle-Eastern food.

889
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:17,657
And Uncle Stevie,
he's a good friend.

890
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:19,158
He's very robust.

891
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,744
Holy fucking shit-ass!
Dougie, you fucking scored!

892
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:25,081
You just fisted that motherfucker
right in the ass.

893
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:28,626
Fuck! I'm so sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry, sir, ma'am.

894
00:45:28,751 --> 00:45:31,045
- There he is! There's the guy!
- Hey!

895
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,881
Dougie, my friend.
Good to see you as always, hey.

896
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:37,218
That's my top customer right there.
Five times a week I see you, right?

897
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:39,303
A pair of falafels this boy has on him.

898
00:45:39,428 --> 00:45:42,765
I watched this guy fight three guys,
knock out all their teeth.

899
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,433
Three guys! Four teeth!

900
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,477
One game! It was unbelievable.

901
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:48,104
I'm so excited. Fuck it!

902
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:51,691
Everybody, donair
on the house tonight?

903
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:53,276
For you, anything, buddy.

904
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:55,653
Pardon me.
Donair <i>sauce</i> on the house, everybody.

905
00:45:55,778 --> 00:45:57,697
Don't get excited.
Donair <i>sauce.</i>

906
00:45:57,822 --> 00:45:59,115
Thank you.

907
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,283
Hey!

908
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:01,534
That guy, he's awesome.

909
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,077
Water down the donair sauce.

910
00:46:03,202 --> 00:46:06,247
So, Doug, think we can get
anything for this on eBay?

911
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:08,124
I don't think so.

912
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:10,334
No, I wanted to give this
to Mom and Dad, actually,

913
00:46:10,459 --> 00:46:13,045
if they wanted to see just...

914
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,674
Here.

915
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:21,429
Douglas, it's good to see
that you're having fun with this,

916
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:23,431
you know, hobby.

917
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:25,016
It's not a hobby.

918
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:28,978
It's my job, Mom.
I'm a hockey player.

919
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:31,397
Have you given any thought at all
to the head injuries

920
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,191
that come with playing
such a violent sport?

921
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:34,650
The concussions?

922
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,694
How long do you think
you can do this?

923
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:37,862
Mom...

924
00:46:37,987 --> 00:46:40,615
It's an infantile way for a man
to spend his adult years.

925
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,949
No, it isn't.

926
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:43,075
You can do anything.

927
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,660
You can do anything
except punch people, okay?

928
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:46,495
- No, I couldn't.
- You can teach.

929
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:49,582
No, I can't! Okay?

930
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:52,627
I can't because I'm stupid.
I'm stupid!

931
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:54,629
Doug, you're not that stupid.

932
00:46:54,754 --> 00:46:55,922
I am.

933
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,673
I'm stupid. You're gay.

934
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:59,634
I'm stupid. He's gay.

935
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:00,885
Stupid. Gay.

936
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,221
- We get it.
- Stupid. Gay!

937
00:47:03,346 --> 00:47:05,890
You have one stupid son,
and you got a gay son.

938
00:47:06,015 --> 00:47:07,058
Oh, God.

939
00:47:07,183 --> 00:47:09,727
For once in my life,
I'm actually a part of something.

940
00:47:09,852 --> 00:47:14,482
I get to wear a uniform
that doesn't have "Security" on it.

941
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:19,528
Kids buy it, and they wear it,
and it's got our name on it.

942
00:47:19,654 --> 00:47:20,655
Now, for whatever reason,

943
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,575
you guys think that I can be
smart enough to be a doctor.

944
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,912
I have fist smarts.
Now, I can fight.

945
00:47:28,037 --> 00:47:30,581
I'm strong.
I can protect people.

946
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:32,667
That's who I am.
This is what I do.

947
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:34,710
And you should be proud of me.

948
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:36,504
We should be proud of you?

949
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:39,548
They call you Thug,
for Christ's sake!

950
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:42,677
It might as well say "Security"
on the back of your sweater.

951
00:47:42,802 --> 00:47:44,679
Excuse me.

952
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:53,562
- Doug, I am proud of you.
- Thanks, buddy.

953
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:57,525
Okay? But I'm gonna go
with Mom and Dad, okay?

954
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,986
They got my passport.

955
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:05,032
Look, no disrespect
intended, but, honestly,

956
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:08,744
fuck your parents if they don't
fucking appreciate you, man.

957
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:11,831
Like, look at you.
You're a fucking beast.

958
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,916
You're like the fucking
Hebrew Dolph Lundgren

959
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,293
or some shit.

960
00:48:15,418 --> 00:48:18,462
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

961
00:48:18,587 --> 00:48:20,756
Doug, watching you tonight

962
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:24,135
was like watching a bunch
of fucking birds flying in a.

963
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,512
It was instinct...

964
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,055
and purpose.

965
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,268
It was like you were doing
what you were born to do.

966
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:36,439
I mean, Jesus Christ, Doug,
look at your fucking fist.

967
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:40,026
It's like the size
of my Uncle Murphy's prostate.

968
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,610
I really feel like
getting hammered right now.

969
00:48:41,736 --> 00:48:43,446
Let's get so fucking drunk

970
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:46,032
we see each other's
donair sauce on the floor.

971
00:49:04,592 --> 00:49:07,762
You don't know shit
about hockey, you bulimic Don Cherry!

972
00:49:07,887 --> 00:49:09,472
You fucking spit in my face!

973
00:49:09,597 --> 00:49:11,474
Fuck your Ed Hardy shirt!

974
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,018
- What the hell? Hey, hey!
- He fucking started it!

975
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:16,896
Oh, come on!
You're spitting everywhere!

976
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,272
Your friend is fucking sick!

977
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:20,358
Oh, yeah,
says the fucking Frenchman!

978
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:21,817
Your people live like animals!

979
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:23,110
I hate spit! I hate it!

980
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:24,570
Oh!

981
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:27,907
FUCK you!

982
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,415
What's your problem?

983
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,501
I'll tell you my problem.

984
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:41,253
How many minutes
did you play tonight?

985
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:44,173
I don't know. 11. So?

986
00:49:44,298 --> 00:49:46,467
You skate like shit,

987
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:50,471
but you play 11 fucking minutes.

988
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,348
Who the fuck are you?!

989
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:54,225
I'm a fucking hockey player.

990
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,936
You steal my
You steal my power play.

991
00:49:57,061 --> 00:49:59,688
You're a fucking goon! A thug!

992
00:49:59,814 --> 00:50:01,273
You're fucking nothing!

993
00:50:17,456 --> 00:50:20,209
You are not a hockey player.

994
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:21,419
The only reason

995
00:50:21,544 --> 00:50:23,379
why I'm not knocking
your teeth out right now

996
00:50:23,504 --> 00:50:24,797
is 'cause you're on my team.

997
00:50:25,965 --> 00:50:27,883
Do you have any idea
what would happen

998
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:29,885
if I stopped watching your back?

999
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:32,847
Yeah.
It'd be like before you came.

1000
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:35,474
I like that better.

1001
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:56,704
We have not pissed together

1002
00:50:56,829 --> 00:51:00,040
since last time we double-teamed
Belchior's mother?

1003
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,876
Oh, and we pissed on her, too.

1004
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,589
You pissed on my leg!

1005
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:10,593
All right, lads! All right.

1006
00:51:10,718 --> 00:51:13,012
We're in the shit now.

1007
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,388
This is Quebec.

1008
00:51:14,513 --> 00:51:16,765
Get your fucking game faces on.

1009
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:19,059
This is about to get ugly.

1010
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:22,104
We got four games left, boys.
We only need two of 'em.

1011
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:25,733
Shove your <i>têtes carrées</i>
up their derrières

1012
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:28,402
and rip their fucking hearts out!

1013
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,070
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1014
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:21,580
You're with me tonight, Mommy.

1015
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,749
You are with me tonight.

1016
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,543
You feel the fucking energy
in this building?

1017
00:52:25,668 --> 00:52:27,545
I want you to take that fucking energy
out onto the ice.

1018
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:29,713
Dougie, you're gonna shadow
LaFlamme the entire game.

1019
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,215
You, Gord, LaFlamme,
you're starting.

1020
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,926
Boys, we're in this fucking thing.

1021
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,554
Now let's play
like we're supposed to be here!

1022
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:37,972
- Let's go!
- All right!

1023
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:42,518
Dougie, on LaFlamme!
Stick to him! Stick to him!

1024
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:44,103
We're rooting for you, Gordon!

1025
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:45,396
We're all in this together.

1026
00:52:45,521 --> 00:52:47,273
When that puck drops, we all drop.

1027
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,108
Shut the fuck up!

1028
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,944
Here we go!
The fries have been frenched.

1029
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:54,613
The cheese has been curded.
Let's pour some gravy on me...

1030
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,407
Let's drop the fucking puck!

1031
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:58,284
And dig in.

1032
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,786
Halifax gets the face-off.
Back to LaFlamme.

1033
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,080
He comes up ice
with a full head of steam.

1034
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:06,625
Simard lines up LaFlamme.
LaFlamme avoids the check!

1035
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,085
Simard flies into the boards.

1036
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,753
Here's LaFlamme
moving up the right side.

1037
00:53:09,878 --> 00:53:11,005
Cuts toward the net.

1038
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,215
LaFlamme takes it to him!
He scored!

1039
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,466
LaFlamme a tremendous move.

1040
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:15,843
All right!

1041
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:18,012
The defenseman
totally lost control...

1042
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:19,555
FUCK you!

1043
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,098
Nice job, bro!

1044
00:53:30,065 --> 00:53:32,526
Here's LaFlamme, picks up the
puck behind the net.

1045
00:53:32,651 --> 00:53:34,862
He starts away.
He spins away from one check.

1046
00:53:34,987 --> 00:53:36,822
- Now gets up to center ice.
- Gord!

1047
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,657
Takes a look.
Feeds the pass over.

1048
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,868
Back, back, back,
back, back, back!

1049
00:53:40,993 --> 00:53:43,329
He gets it back again.
Swings by another check.

1050
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,955
Walks in.

1051
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,044
Man on, man on!

1052
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:54,465
Hey! What the fuck? Dougie!

1053
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,216
And Glatt
was looking the other way.

1054
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,601
Get him off!

1055
00:54:06,935 --> 00:54:09,021
That's it, Dougie! Leave him!

1056
00:54:18,739 --> 00:54:20,199
They're calling
for the stretcher.

1057
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,242
This is getting scary, folks.

1058
00:54:30,459 --> 00:54:31,877
Jesus Christ.

1059
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,420
Easy, boys.

1060
00:54:35,547 --> 00:54:37,675
Xavier, look at me.

1061
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,885
Okay, he's got a concussion.

1062
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,095
He may not be back at all.

1063
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,681
And for what you did to Simard,
you've been suspended.

1064
00:54:43,806 --> 00:54:45,516
We're lucky it's only one game.

1065
00:54:45,641 --> 00:54:47,768
You know what, Glatt?
This team counts on you.

1066
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:51,063
Whatever it is
that is making you fucking ovulate,

1067
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:54,692
you'd better figure it out quick
and get your fucking shit together!

1068
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:58,237
And for those of you who think
you've got no practice tomorrow...

1069
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:01,115
6:00 a.m., bag skate, pussies!

1070
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,326
I want to see every single one of you

1071
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:07,621
work your fucking asses off
until you're puking guts out!

1072
00:55:07,746 --> 00:55:10,416
This is not fucking baseball!

1073
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:13,001
Do you want
to make the playoffs or not?

1074
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:16,213
God damn it. And Glatt!

1075
00:55:16,338 --> 00:55:17,881
I see you.

1076
00:55:18,006 --> 00:55:19,591
You're riding piss hole.

1077
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,552
Back of the bus.

1078
00:55:27,683 --> 00:55:29,268
Roll it out, George.

1079
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:39,213
I can't really talk now.
That's why I was texting you.

1080
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:41,507
I'm sorry. I'm such a moron.

1081
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:42,966
So, you saw my headbutt?

1082
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:45,260
Yeah. You fucked him up.

1083
00:56:45,385 --> 00:56:46,845
Are you at the library?

1084
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,138
No...

1085
00:56:48,263 --> 00:56:51,892
my boyfriend got home
a few days ago.

1086
00:56:52,017 --> 00:56:53,936
Why did you text me, then?

1087
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:56,104
I dig talking to you,

1088
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,856
and now I'm thinking about you,

1089
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:01,485
and sometimes I sleep
with that Angus-the-Highlander doll.

1090
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,238
There's nothing weird about that.
It's official.

1091
00:57:04,363 --> 00:57:08,283
Yeah, Doug. I know.

1092
00:57:08,408 --> 00:57:10,369
Fuck.

1093
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,996
I'm a bad girlfriend, Doug.

1094
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:16,750
Well, I mean,
all we did was make out.

1095
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,919
I'm a slut, Doug.

1096
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:21,129
I'm horny a lot.

1097
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:22,339
I sleep around.

1098
00:57:22,464 --> 00:57:23,799
Oh, okay.

1099
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:26,301
That doesn't bother you?

1100
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:28,804
The truth is, I just...

1101
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:30,806
I have a really huge crush on you.

1102
00:57:35,644 --> 00:57:37,271
I got to go, Doug.

1103
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:13,807
Hello, sir.
My name is Doug Glatt.

1104
00:58:18,687 --> 00:58:21,481
Ross Rhea.
Nice to meet you, kid.

1105
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:23,984
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Sit down.

1106
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,320
Thanks.

1107
00:58:26,445 --> 00:58:28,155
So, you're the new me, eh?

1108
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:33,619
I don't know about that.
I don't think so.

1109
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:35,412
Everyone else seems to.

1110
00:58:35,537 --> 00:58:37,748
It's good.

1111
00:58:37,873 --> 00:58:39,374
Good for you, kid.

1112
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:40,834
Thank you.

1113
00:58:40,959 --> 00:58:43,045
What are you doing
wandering around St. John's

1114
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,296
at 3:00 in the morning?

1115
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:46,715
Aren't you guys playing us tonight?

1116
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,802
Well, yeah, but not me.
I got suspended a game.

1117
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:54,139
Too bad.

1118
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,350
I ain't much for waiting around.

1119
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,062
You're a tough little bastard out there.

1120
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:01,730
You can fucking bang.

1121
00:59:01,855 --> 00:59:03,523
Thank you. Thanks so much.

1122
00:59:03,649 --> 00:59:06,360
So, I'm gonna impart some
of the wisdom of my years on you.

1123
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:07,861
I could really use some of that.

1124
00:59:07,986 --> 00:59:11,740
Everybody loves the soldiers until
they come home and stop fighting.

1125
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:13,033
You understand what I'm saying?

1126
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:15,452
Mm...

1127
00:59:15,577 --> 00:59:17,287
I don't know. No.

1128
00:59:17,412 --> 00:59:21,583
Kid, you got this thing, the stuff,
the shit, the fucking grit.

1129
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,585
You got it, like me.

1130
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:26,004
But like me,
that's all you fucking got.

1131
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:30,467
And like me, you're no good
to anyone doing anything else.

1132
00:59:30,592 --> 00:59:34,304
All I'm saying is don't go trying to be
a hockey player.

1133
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:36,848
You'll get your fucking heart
ripped out.

1134
00:59:38,517 --> 00:59:40,185
But I am a hockey player, sir.

1135
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,312
You're a fucking goon.

1136
00:59:42,437 --> 00:59:44,398
That plays hockey, like you.

1137
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:47,317
I don't play much hockey.

1138
00:59:47,442 --> 00:59:48,860
You're a hockey player, sir.

1139
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:51,655
You know they just want you to bleed,
right?

1140
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:56,118
Well, I'm here to do
whatever they need me to do.

1141
00:59:56,243 --> 01:00:00,080
You know, if they need me to bleed,
then I'll bleed for my team.

1142
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:05,002
Yeah.

1143
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:08,922
I suppose you heard
I'm gonna retire the end of the season.

1144
01:00:09,047 --> 01:00:11,174
I've been at this since I was 17,

1145
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:12,801
but I'll be damned if I'm gonna go out

1146
01:00:12,926 --> 01:00:15,178
like some Nancy-boy,
middle-aged fuck.

1147
01:00:15,303 --> 01:00:16,346
You understand?

1148
01:00:16,471 --> 01:00:18,306
Yeah, I understand.

1149
01:00:18,432 --> 01:00:20,684
You have my respect.

1150
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:23,186
Whatever that means to you,
you got it.

1151
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:26,523
But know this shit hard.

1152
01:00:26,648 --> 01:00:28,692
If ever there comes a time
when it gets down to the marrow

1153
01:00:28,817 --> 01:00:30,652
and it's you and me...

1154
01:00:30,777 --> 01:00:32,571
kid...

1155
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,949
I will lay you the fuck out.

1156
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,195
Come here,
you piece of fucking shit!

1157
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,238
Get the fuck over here!

1158
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:21,161
Everyone knows what I'm here for.

1159
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:22,913
To kick fucking ass!

1160
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,252
That's right. I fight.

1161
01:01:29,377 --> 01:01:32,047
I fight for my team.

1162
01:01:32,172 --> 01:01:35,425
They need me to bleed,
then I bleed.

1163
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:42,182
I started my career here in St. John's.

1164
01:01:42,307 --> 01:01:47,896
I think it's only fitting that I...
I'm winding it up here.

1165
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:52,317
That being said,
I still got some fight in me left.

1166
01:01:54,027 --> 01:01:56,279
What do you say, boys?
Let's go to the playoffs.

1167
01:01:56,404 --> 01:01:57,989
Give the old man
one last shot at a ring.

1168
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:00,742
How about it, eh?
God bless Newfoundland!

1169
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,750
It's a rough,
physical game tonight, folks.

1170
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:12,129
Both teams jockeying for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the East.

1171
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,215
I'm open!

1172
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,383
Stevenson calling for the puck.

1173
01:02:16,508 --> 01:02:18,051
He's absolutely leveled by Rhea!

1174
01:02:18,176 --> 01:02:19,469
Where's the call?

1175
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:20,720
Shamrocks take the puck in.

1176
01:02:20,846 --> 01:02:22,430
They shoot! He scored!

1177
01:02:22,556 --> 01:02:24,099
St. John's has taken an early lead.

1178
01:02:24,224 --> 01:02:28,562
Rhea absolutely running over
the poor Highlanders.

1179
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:30,272
It's anarchy on the ice.

1180
01:02:30,397 --> 01:02:32,065
Cheap shot, Rhea. No need.

1181
01:02:35,735 --> 01:02:37,821
Take it.

1182
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:39,406
I'm gonna fight you, man.

1183
01:02:39,531 --> 01:02:40,615
Oh, come on, Gord.

1184
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,033
You know how this ends.

1185
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,785
No shit.

1186
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,787
All right, come on.

1187
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:47,873
Are you sure?

1188
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:52,002
Come on, Gord.

1189
01:03:03,763 --> 01:03:05,432
Shit!

1190
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:10,520
I can do this all night, boys.

1191
01:03:10,645 --> 01:03:13,231
Gord Ogilvey
getting into only the third fight

1192
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,858
of his entire career.

1193
01:03:14,983 --> 01:03:17,402
Yeah, if I want any lip from you,
I'll rattle my zipper.

1194
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,570
"A" for effort, captain.

1195
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,406
And "D" for Doug Glatt.

1196
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,451
Are you there, Doug?
It's me, Margaret!

1197
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:52,437
Xavier, are you up?

1198
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:53,688
I'm an idiot.

1199
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:55,899
From now on,
no matter what happens,

1200
01:03:56,024 --> 01:04:00,528
if you want to punch me in the face
or spit in my mouth while I'm asleep,

1201
01:04:00,654 --> 01:04:01,738
it doesn't matter.

1202
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:04,324
I'm always gonna be
watching your back.

1203
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:07,035
I think that we both have
a light in our stomachs.

1204
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,454
A special light, like E.T.

1205
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:12,332
And the team needs somebody
to light the way.

1206
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:16,503
My stomach light
needs your stomach light.

1207
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:19,089
We can all phone home together.

1208
01:04:23,802 --> 01:04:26,846
Two home games left
in the season, both must-wins.

1209
01:04:26,972 --> 01:04:30,225
If they don't, they're gonna wind up
on the golf course early,

1210
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,394
and that doesn't sound
quite so bad to me.

1211
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:35,480
18 holes and a Reuben.

1212
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,149
Here come the Highlanders!

1213
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:52,539
Glatt, what the fuck? Hockey!

1214
01:04:52,664 --> 01:04:55,750
Head up, head up, head up, head up! Go,
go, go, go!

1215
01:04:58,712 --> 01:05:00,672
Glatt! What are you doing?

1216
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,050
The Highlanders
start out of their own zone.

1217
01:05:04,175 --> 01:05:06,344
Here's the pass over to LaFlamme.
LaFlamme taking it along the boards.

1218
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,556
He's run into by Finnerty,
and now Glatt comes in.

1219
01:05:46,134 --> 01:05:47,427
Hey, man.

1220
01:05:49,137 --> 01:05:50,513
Nice fight.

1221
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:55,852
Puck! Puck!

1222
01:05:55,977 --> 01:05:58,021
Now the puck
back in the Highlanders' zone,

1223
01:05:58,146 --> 01:06:00,231
and the Highlanders bring it away.

1224
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:01,733
Here's LaFlamme.
He moves it over to Glatt.

1225
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:04,778
Glatt, he duffs the shot,
gets it back to LaFlamme.

1226
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:06,154
LaFlamme walks... He scores!

1227
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:10,033
LaFlamme scores the goal
with an assist going to Glatt.

1228
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:15,997
Nice one, Dougie!

1229
01:06:16,122 --> 01:06:17,624
LaFlamme!

1230
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:20,418
- Nice assist, man.
- Thanks.

1231
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,046
69! Doug!

1232
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:25,298
69! Yeah!

1233
01:06:28,927 --> 01:06:31,513
Well, it has come down to this, folks.

1234
01:06:31,638 --> 01:06:35,809
The Highlanders need this win
to keep their playoff hopes alive.

1235
01:06:35,934 --> 01:06:39,396
LaFlamme serving
a high-sticking major

1236
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:42,482
with his team nursing
a tenuous one-goal lead.

1237
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:45,402
Can they hang on?

1238
01:06:45,527 --> 01:06:47,570
I love you, Mom.

1239
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:51,032
Dougie, hey,
keep that fucking crease clean!

1240
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:53,535
Clear them out!
Front of the crease the whole time.

1241
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:02,168
Let's get fucking real, boys.

1242
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:04,212
Let's get fucking real!

1243
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:06,798
Now the puck
goes back to the point.

1244
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:09,384
Concord pulling the goaltender.
Going with six attackers.

1245
01:07:09,509 --> 01:07:12,303
Hold the box, boys!
Clear the crease, Dougie!

1246
01:07:13,555 --> 01:07:16,099
Let's go, man!
Let's go, fuck-face! Boom!

1247
01:07:16,224 --> 01:07:18,059
Come on, Dougie!
Come on, Dougie!

1248
01:07:18,184 --> 01:07:21,896
Seconds tick down.
There's about 27 left now.

1249
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:24,524
Come on now! Let's go!

1250
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:26,067
Clear it out! Clear it out!
Give me the puck!

1251
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:27,610
Clear the fucking crease!

1252
01:07:27,735 --> 01:07:29,154
Where's the puck, man?
I can't see the shot.

1253
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:30,697
Shot right, shot right!

1254
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,741
I'm down! I'm down!

1255
01:08:02,353 --> 01:08:04,647
Three... two...

1256
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,609
one!

1257
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:10,195
No goal! No goal! No goal!

1258
01:08:12,906 --> 01:08:14,741
Banzai, you motherfucker!

1259
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,288
Dougie? Doug?

1260
01:08:22,373 --> 01:08:23,791
Eat it, puss-puss!

1261
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:25,168
Fight like a fucking man!

1262
01:08:25,293 --> 01:08:27,295
Come on!

1263
01:08:29,214 --> 01:08:31,466
Yeah, you've done it before,
you pussy!

1264
01:08:31,591 --> 01:08:33,801
And I know you fuck your players.
Don't deny it.

1265
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:34,928
Did we win?

1266
01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:36,638
Get him out of there, please.

1267
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:40,642
You stopped it, man.
You fucking did it!

1268
01:08:44,145 --> 01:08:45,438
Oh, fuck.

1269
01:08:45,563 --> 01:08:46,940
<i>Hi, Eva.</i>

1270
01:08:47,065 --> 01:08:49,984
Hi.

1271
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:51,694
It didn't hurt at all.

1272
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:53,905
Dougie. Hey, Dougie.
You're all right. You did it.

1273
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:55,615
You did it. We won it, Dougie.

1274
01:09:04,582 --> 01:09:06,751
Big win here tonight
for Halifax,

1275
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:10,505
but they'll still need one more
if they're to advance to the playoffs.

1276
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:14,801
They meet the St. John's Shamrocks
for the eighth and final playoff spot.

1277
01:09:14,926 --> 01:09:17,679
And if the hockey gods truly exist

1278
01:09:17,804 --> 01:09:21,266
and aren't just a figment
of my aging imagination,

1279
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:25,728
we'll finally get to see
that long-awaited battle

1280
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:29,023
between Ross Rhea and Doug Glatt.

1281
01:09:29,148 --> 01:09:30,692
Okay.

1282
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,280
- Gather 'round here, Highlanders!
- Come on, boys.

1283
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:38,366
Belchie!
Fucking horse cock, get over here.

1284
01:09:38,491 --> 01:09:42,287
Listen, boys,
it was a solid fucking effort tonight.

1285
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:43,413
I fucking loved it.

1286
01:09:43,538 --> 01:09:45,707
And Dougie took one in the face!

1287
01:09:49,043 --> 01:09:50,962
I'm high on painkillers.

1288
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,297
Pass the dutchie, man.

1289
01:09:52,422 --> 01:09:54,257
I will. I got some for you.

1290
01:09:54,382 --> 01:09:57,760
I'm so fucking proud!

1291
01:09:57,885 --> 01:10:01,347
You are un-fucking-real.

1292
01:10:01,472 --> 01:10:04,726
The stuff that you're...

1293
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:09,063
that is, is fucking great!

1294
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:11,524
- Thank you.
- You're our knight!

1295
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:14,444
You're fucking all right, eh?

1296
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:16,279
Thanks, Coach.

1297
01:10:23,494 --> 01:10:24,704
Eva!

1298
01:10:26,664 --> 01:10:28,333
Hey, hey.

1299
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:32,837
No. Hey, what happened?

1300
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,130
Did you just watch "Rudy"?

1301
01:10:34,255 --> 01:10:37,050
No. I did it.
I broke up with him.

1302
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:38,718
Holy shit!

1303
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:41,638
I don't even know what the fuck I'm...

1304
01:10:41,763 --> 01:10:43,931
Hey, come on.

1305
01:10:44,057 --> 01:10:49,103
From what I saw from him,
he seemed like a really nice guy.

1306
01:10:49,228 --> 01:10:51,898
I'm just not in...

1307
01:10:52,023 --> 01:10:53,900
love with him.

1308
01:10:54,025 --> 01:10:56,611
- You're not?
- No!

1309
01:10:56,736 --> 01:10:57,737
You.

1310
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:03,409
You make me want to stop sleeping
with a bunch of guys.

1311
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,872
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

1312
01:11:45,284 --> 01:11:47,453
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

1313
01:11:47,578 --> 01:11:49,247
She's a wonderful girl.

1314
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:53,793
Hit me again.

1315
01:11:58,297 --> 01:11:59,966
Hi, there. I'm Eva.

1316
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:03,761
This is, Dakota?

1317
01:12:05,596 --> 01:12:07,014
Yeah, whatever.

1318
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:10,685
Doug! Where were you?

1319
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,353
Oh, my God!

1320
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:14,564
<i>Tabarnac!</i>
What the fuck happened to you, man?

1321
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:18,359
Hey. Oh, what? This?
No, it's nothing.

1322
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:20,778
What the fuck happened, Doug?

1323
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,906
When you deserve a beating,
you take it.

1324
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:26,868
Oh, Jesus, Doug!

1325
01:12:26,993 --> 01:12:29,996
St. John's and Halifax.
This will mark the first occasion

1326
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,540
that Ross "The Boss" Rhea
and Xavier LaFlamme

1327
01:12:32,665 --> 01:12:34,459
will share the same ice

1328
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:37,044
since that brutal hit
three years ago in Montreal.

1329
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,504
LaFlamme was
severely concussed...

1330
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:39,630
Fuck.

1331
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:42,175
Never quite found
his legs again...

1332
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,342
I made a dive.

1333
01:12:43,468 --> 01:12:45,553
Talk about putting out "la flamme".

1334
01:13:19,003 --> 01:13:22,757
Look at you!
Did you fall off a toilet-paper roll?

1335
01:13:22,882 --> 01:13:25,176
Do you pee rainbows?
You fart cinnamon?

1336
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:27,220
- Don't ruin this for Doug, Pat.
- Rainbows come out of your nipples?

1337
01:13:37,647 --> 01:13:40,149
Well, we're not here
'cause I'm a good fucking captain,

1338
01:13:40,274 --> 01:13:41,359
because I'm not.

1339
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:44,237
I've fucked up
a lot of things in my life.

1340
01:13:44,362 --> 01:13:47,448
I mean, I lost my woman,
and I don't see my kid enough.

1341
01:13:47,573 --> 01:13:49,367
And I guess what I'm trying to say

1342
01:13:49,492 --> 01:13:53,287
is I feel I've gained a family
with you boys.

1343
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:01,587
You skated, you fought,
and you fucking bled,

1344
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:05,758
and you have earned
every piece of this.

1345
01:14:05,883 --> 01:14:08,845
You got that shit
that makes you keep going

1346
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:11,889
long after you got no reason to.

1347
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,308
That Doug shit.

1348
01:14:14,433 --> 01:14:16,519
He's got it, though.
He's got the stuff.

1349
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,898
No matter what happens out there...

1350
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,733
They will know...

1351
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:25,486
the Highlanders were here!

1352
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,453
Highlanders!

1353
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,275
Let's go! Let's go, boys!
Let's go, Dougie!

1354
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,443
All right!

1355
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,788
Come on, Highlanders!

1356
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:20,499
Dougie!

1357
01:15:25,504 --> 01:15:27,214
Hey, Louis!

1358
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,507
Fuck you!

1359
01:15:28,633 --> 01:15:29,675
<i>Je ne parle pas Français.</i>

1360
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,302
Fuck him, man.

1361
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:32,678
So, the Halifax Highlanders

1362
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:34,347
and the St. John's Shamrocks.

1363
01:15:34,472 --> 01:15:38,517
It's all on the line here,
the eighth and final playoff spot.

1364
01:15:38,643 --> 01:15:41,145
And this should be
a dandy confrontation.

1365
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,564
No glory holes
here tonight, man!

1366
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,821
Rhea runs into
a couple of Halifax players.

1367
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:53,532
Here's a shot on goal.
The save is made by Belchior.

1368
01:15:53,658 --> 01:15:54,992
Hey, hey!

1369
01:15:55,993 --> 01:15:57,745
Come here, you piece of shit!

1370
01:16:00,581 --> 01:16:03,084
He's a one-man wrecking crew.

1371
01:16:03,209 --> 01:16:04,585
Come on, Coach.
Too many men on the ice.

1372
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:06,128
Get the fuck out of here!

1373
01:16:06,253 --> 01:16:08,714
Ross Rhea,
you're a cheap motherfucker!

1374
01:16:08,839 --> 01:16:10,174
You cheap bastard!

1375
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,009
Rhea steals the puck.

1376
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,220
He puts it out in front.
He scores!

1377
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:17,807
- Fuck you, Rhea!
- Ha!

1378
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:19,517
Hey! Come on!

1379
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:30,903
I'm gonna score a goal
just for you right now.

1380
01:16:31,028 --> 01:16:33,489
Here's LaFlamme.
Steps out on the ice.

1381
01:16:33,614 --> 01:16:36,117
- Here! Here!
- He calls for the puck.

1382
01:16:36,242 --> 01:16:38,327
He takes the pass.
Here comes LaFlamme.

1383
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:40,329
He's straight up the middle,
in across the left.

1384
01:16:40,454 --> 01:16:41,998
Goes right through the defense.
In on goal.

1385
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:43,165
Shot!

1386
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:44,709
Shit!

1387
01:16:47,378 --> 01:16:48,838
Let's go!

1388
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:51,424
God fucking damn it!

1389
01:16:51,549 --> 01:16:53,342
And the fans
are totally frustrated.

1390
01:16:53,467 --> 01:16:56,554
- Their Halifax team can't buy a goal.
- Come on, Halifax!

1391
01:16:57,888 --> 01:16:59,432
Great save, Belchior!

1392
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:03,477
Let's go!

1393
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:05,438
We just saw Rhea
come off the ice.

1394
01:17:05,563 --> 01:17:07,815
Come on! Let's go, Glatt.

1395
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:10,192
Let's go, boys! Stick with him.
Stick with him.

1396
01:17:10,317 --> 01:17:13,154
Rhea manages to step out on
the ice at the same time.

1397
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:14,989
This could get scary.

1398
01:17:18,034 --> 01:17:19,994
Rhea and Glatt,
are they gonna have a go?

1399
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:21,328
Come on!

1400
01:17:23,289 --> 01:17:24,790
Come on!

1401
01:17:24,915 --> 01:17:26,333
Here we go! Here we go!
Here we go!

1402
01:17:26,459 --> 01:17:29,462
Rhea skates away!
No! He suckered him.

1403
01:17:29,587 --> 01:17:31,172
What the shit is that?!

1404
01:17:31,297 --> 01:17:33,132
He forced him
to take a penalty.

1405
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:34,759
- Fucker!
- Fuck you!

1406
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:37,136
Come on, ref!
You can't call that!

1407
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:38,846
He was fucking instigating!

1408
01:17:38,971 --> 01:17:42,266
You got to keep your boy
out of the box, Ronnie.

1409
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:50,149
Shorthanded situation,
a great opportunity.

1410
01:17:50,274 --> 01:17:51,942
Clear it out now! Clear it out!

1411
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:53,402
Hey!

1412
01:17:53,527 --> 01:17:55,112
- He scores!
- Shit!

1413
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:58,282
Fuck a duck! Pig fucker!

1414
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:01,744
Here we go now, boys. Real hockey!
Let's go now. Get it back!

1415
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:09,168
Off the draw,
here's LaFlamme out on the ice now.

1416
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:10,669
Rhea out as well.

1417
01:18:10,795 --> 01:18:12,963
Let's go. Let's go!
Change it up!

1418
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:16,634
And now LaFlamme actually
takes a run at big Rhea.

1419
01:18:16,759 --> 01:18:17,802
Eat that shit, Matlock!

1420
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,845
- You want something, Frenchie?
- Come on.

1421
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:21,847
Come here. You want some?

1422
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:23,307
Remember what happened
last time?

1423
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:24,600
Let's go.

1424
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:27,311
Now Glatt steps in.

1425
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,355
That was a dirty shot, Doug.

1426
01:18:30,648 --> 01:18:32,108
Come on, boys, let's play.
Come on, come on!

1427
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:34,860
Get 'em off! Get 'em off now!
Come on!

1428
01:18:36,153 --> 01:18:38,405
Three in white,
two minutes for crosschecking.

1429
01:18:38,531 --> 01:18:41,075
69 in blue, two minutes,
crosschecking.

1430
01:18:42,243 --> 01:18:43,452
Early in the third.

1431
01:18:43,577 --> 01:18:45,371
Glatt and Rhea
both in the penalty box.

1432
01:18:45,496 --> 01:18:46,622
It opens up a little room.

1433
01:18:46,747 --> 01:18:49,083
The puck is now down
in the Halifax zone.

1434
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,793
Go, Highlanders!

1435
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,545
Come on, Highlanders!

1436
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:04,598
Looks like these fans
are out for blood tonight.

1437
01:19:17,903 --> 01:19:19,947
Kid, you ready?

1438
01:19:20,072 --> 01:19:22,616
Yes. Thank you for asking.

1439
01:19:46,599 --> 01:19:48,350
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is actually fucking happening.

1440
01:19:48,475 --> 01:19:51,604
Dougie "The Thug" Glatt
is about to fucking drop the gloves

1441
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:53,314
and take on
Ross "The Boss" Rhea.

1442
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:56,150
This has all the elements
of a fucking sports masterpiece.

1443
01:19:56,275 --> 01:19:59,612
Holy fuck!
We got the worried ladyfriend face

1444
01:19:59,737 --> 01:20:01,822
frozen with concern.

1445
01:20:01,947 --> 01:20:04,909
We got the gay brother. Yup!

1446
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:07,786
And the lovable, wisecracking,
Mick-best-friend,

1447
01:20:07,912 --> 01:20:10,664
Orangetown-son,
pussy-crew, album-dropping...

1448
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:12,166
Oh, fuck! Here we go.

1449
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:14,001
Here we go! Oh, my God!

1450
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,347
Come on!

1451
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:39,026
Come on, Dougie!
Take his fucking head off!

1452
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:41,904
Kick his ass, Dougie! Come on!

1453
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,865
That's it! That's it!

1454
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,660
Come on!

1455
01:20:49,995 --> 01:20:51,247
- Shit!
- Jesus!

1456
01:20:51,372 --> 01:20:52,373
Don't you fucking dare.

1457
01:20:52,498 --> 01:20:53,624
Come on, Doug!

1458
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:56,085
He's okay.
He's always had bad fucking ankles.

1459
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:59,129
- You got him.
- Come on, Dougie.

1460
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:00,839
Get him. Come on, man.

1461
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:05,302
Come on, hit him!

1462
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:12,351
Fuck!

1463
01:21:12,476 --> 01:21:14,853
You feel that shit, Rhea?

1464
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:17,189
- Nice hit, Doug!
- Take that shit!

1465
01:21:19,817 --> 01:21:22,236
You show him
where the fuck you're from!

1466
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:30,202
Oh, fuck.

1467
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,461
You're a fucking warrior, Doug!

1468
01:21:39,586 --> 01:21:40,587
Come on, Doug!

1469
01:21:40,713 --> 01:21:42,631
He's not done yet.

1470
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,186
Shit.

1471
01:22:47,071 --> 01:22:49,406
Doug! Oh, my God! Doug!

1472
01:22:56,163 --> 01:22:58,916
Attaboy, Dougie!
Come on, kiddo!

1473
01:23:11,303 --> 01:23:12,679
You fucking did it, kid.

1474
01:23:12,805 --> 01:23:13,806
You did it.

1475
01:23:13,931 --> 01:23:15,849
Doug!

1476
01:23:15,974 --> 01:23:17,017
You did it.

1477
01:23:52,344 --> 01:23:53,679
He scores!

1478
01:23:53,804 --> 01:23:57,015
It's 2-1 with 15:25 left in the third.

1479
01:23:57,141 --> 01:23:59,059
Here's LaFlamme,
steals the puck at his blue line.

1480
01:23:59,184 --> 01:24:01,728
- He's breaking away!
- Attaboy!

1481
01:24:01,854 --> 01:24:04,398
In across the line.
He fakes, backhand, he scores!

1482
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:05,399
Xavier!

1483
01:24:05,524 --> 01:24:08,110
LaFlamme has taken it
on his shoulders!

1484
01:24:08,235 --> 01:24:11,822
He's tied this thing 2-2 with 5:23 left.

1485
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:15,993
Here comes...
Shifty LaFlamme once again.

1486
01:24:16,118 --> 01:24:19,288
Dipsy-doodles,
leaves bodies in his wake.

1487
01:24:19,413 --> 01:24:21,373
- He scores!
- Yeah!

1488
01:24:21,498 --> 01:24:24,293
3-2! 1:21 left.

1489
01:24:24,418 --> 01:24:27,045
What a performance by LaFlamme!

1490
01:24:27,171 --> 01:24:28,672
Three straight goals!

1491
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,341
- LaFlamme!
- LaFlamme!

1492
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:35,554
1:21 from the playoffs
in Halifax.

1493
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:45,981
I think I nailed him.

1494
01:27:19,009 --> 01:27:20,344
- Let's go, Doug!
- Come on, Dougie!

1495
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:21,595
Come on, Doug!

1496
01:27:25,265 --> 01:27:28,268
We got a fight going on.
It's our new boy, Doug Smith.

1497
01:27:28,393 --> 01:27:30,437
Oh, is he working him over!

1498
01:27:30,562 --> 01:27:32,939
He dropped Miciak like nothing!

1499
01:27:33,065 --> 01:27:36,318
Oh, he'll soon become
a favorite of Johnstown fans.

1500
01:27:43,158 --> 01:27:44,117
I can't see.

1501
01:27:45,494 --> 01:27:46,495
Isn't that unbelievable?

1502
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,413
Get some clapping going.
What the fuck?

1503
01:27:55,253 --> 01:27:58,382
- Come on, Doug! Yeah!
- There you go!

1504
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:01,051
A few shots in.
Smith trying with the uppercut.

1505
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:02,177
There goes Smitty!

1506
01:28:02,302 --> 01:28:04,096
Doug "The Hammer" Smith
of the Packers.

1507
01:28:04,221 --> 01:28:06,306
Right over right
over right over right,

1508
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:08,892
as they've connected
with about 30 punches total.

1509
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:12,729
Oh! There's Smith and Daviault.
What a scrap we're gonna have here.

1510
01:28:12,854 --> 01:28:17,067
Two big heavyweights,
both with some good balance.

1511
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:24,486
Feces!

1512
01:30:24,611 --> 01:30:26,780
That's gross, y'all.

1513
01:30:26,905 --> 01:30:28,323
Yeah, don't touch that feces.

1514
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:29,825
- Sing it, pal.
- What?
