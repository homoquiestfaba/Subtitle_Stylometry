1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,791
Whoa. Whoa!

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,635
Huh?

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,598
Awesome.
Great use of your chin as a brake, Honey.

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,434
Don't eat too much sand.
You'll spoil your dinner.

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,897
Look, it's Superman.
Superman!

6
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,690
It's the Man of Steel!

7
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,983
He's going to save us.

8
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,611
Whoo! Superman! Ha ha ha.

9
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,155
Wait, what is he saving us from?
Lunch?

10
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,199
Yeah, it's a pretty nice day.

11
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,210
Ha ha ha. Huh?

12
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,006
Huh?

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:41,266
Bizarro save tiny people
from tentacle creature.

14
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,900
Bizarro no like calamari.

15
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,738
Aah!
My baby!

16
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,582
Oh.
Mommy.

17
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,626
Don't worry. They're just fine.

18
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,921
But this one spit up a little
sand when I caught him.

19
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,881
Thank you, Superman.

20
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,468
You saved my child from your
crazy brother.

21
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,303
Oh, no. No, no, no.

22
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,555
That's not my brother.

23
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:24,434
It... I mean, he, was created when Lex
Luthor hit me with a duplicator ray...

24
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,479
To make a clone of me he
could control.

25
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,775
Excuse me.

26
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,864
Bizarro, put that down.

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,491
Bizarro put down.

28
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,539
Down means up, up means down.

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,041
Why does everything have to
be backwards with you?

30
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,505
Bizarro help Superman save
Metropolis from tentacle creature.

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,050
Why is it every time you try to help,
Metropolis ends up destroyed?

32
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,011
That octopus isn't a creature.
Oh.

33
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,598
It isn't even an octopus.
It's not dangerous. Huh?

34
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,071
Ha ha ha. Boom.

35
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,701
My car! Do you know how long
it took me to assemble?

36
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,078
There were, like, so many bricks.

37
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,915
Can you take your identical
twin somewhere else?

38
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,499
Twins? Oh, no.

39
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,960
He's actually the opposite of
me in every way.

40
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,472
Ha! Bizarro save Metropolis.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,098
Bizarro save home.

42
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,184
Hey, who's gonna pay for this?

43
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,645
Someone might have
gotten hurt in all of this.

44
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,532
You sure did.
This is ridiculous.

45
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,716
You know, I recently
discovered a place that

46
00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:55,717
needs your help even
more than Metropolis.

47
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,820
Let's not go.

48
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,364
Follow me.

49
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,700
I mean, don't follow me.

50
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:27,307
Bizarro spy with his little eye,
something start with letter S.

51
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,059
Space.

52
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,396
How Superman know?

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,984
Should be around....

54
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,736
Ah! Right there.

55
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,375
Aah! Oh.

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,758
Pretty. Ha ha ha.

57
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,637
Ugh!

58
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,186
Ha ha ha. That tickled.

59
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,230
Where you take Bizarro?

60
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,357
Somewhere you can't get into trouble.

61
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:21,153
This planet's physics
are a little backwards.

62
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,612
Just like you.

63
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,324
It's going to be the perfect home.

64
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,327
Home Metropolis.

65
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,871
How I save Daily Planet?

66
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,206
How I save people here?

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,167
Hmm....

68
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,169
Watch this.

69
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,435
The Daily Planet, just like the
one on Earth. What do you think?

70
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,480
Uh....

71
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,608
Ah!

72
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,614
Bizarro, that citizen is in trouble.

73
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,706
Ha!

74
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,166
Ah!

75
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,508
Ha!

76
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,720
You nothing to worry for, Citizen.

77
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,348
Bizarro keep safe.

78
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,516
Aah!

79
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,684
I think I kill him.

80
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,396
I think I kill him. Aah!

81
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,564
No, no, he'll be just fine.

82
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,233
He just needs to rest at home.

83
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,610
Wait, he needs a home.

84
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,654
Can you build him a home, Bizarro?

85
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,949
Uh, Bizarro build.

86
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,703
I'd wish you good luck, Bizarro,
but I know you'd take it the wrong way.

87
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,732
It's Giganta!
Run, run, run!

88
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,195
What is that thing?

89
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,575
Out of my way.

90
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,328
I don't wanna be pulling mini
figs out of my toes.

91
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,124
The Daily Planet news building.

92
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,293
Well, I got news for you.

93
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,711
Print is dead.

94
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,480
This skyscraper is heavier
than you think.

95
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,989
Now Clark Kent doesn't have
to look for a new job.

96
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:22,334
By the Golden Girdle of Gaea, Giganta,
this is no way for a lady to act.

97
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,837
Or dress.
Animal prints are so last season.

98
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,881
Leopard spots are the new black.

99
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,342
And I'm gonna make you black
and blue.

100
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,136
Get back here.

101
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,596
If you say so.

102
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:42,687
The perfect distraction
for the perfect plan.

103
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,408
The Justice League will never
figure out what I'm really up to.

104
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,162
Let me take a shot at it,
Gorilla Grodd.

105
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,793
You use your mind control helmet
to turn Giganta, Penguin...

106
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,170
Deathstroke and Captain Cold
into henchmen.

107
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,633
So while Giganta wreaks havoc on
Metropolis, you go after your real prize.

108
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,762
Pretty good guess, and a lot
of words on one breath.

109
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,522
Ugh.
Booyah!

110
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:30,402
Bats knew you'd try that, so he
had me snatch your hypno helmet.

111
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,988
He's just so smart.

112
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,123
Ugh!

113
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,592
Grodd had us under mind control.

114
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,970
We're stealing for you?

115
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,263
That's cold, Man.

116
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,432
This heist better be for
something good.

117
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,184
Huh?
Aah!

118
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,978
Bananas?

119
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,980
Ha, ha. Bananas?

120
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,817
I like bananas? Ha ha ha.

121
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,528
Nobody makes a monkey out of me.

122
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,405
Let's get out of here.

123
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,062
They're getting away.
Relax, Cyborg. They won't get far.

124
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,857
Hawkman, Operation Crop Duster.

125
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,026
Flash, I need you after
Captain Cold.

126
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,444
I'm on it.

127
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,613
Green Arrow,
see if you have anything

128
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,682
in your quiver to take
down a flightless bird.

129
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,867
Copy that, Dark Knight.

130
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:04,162
Plastic Man, I need you
to wrap up Deathstroke.

131
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,832
Roger Dodger, Caped Crusader.

132
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,292
Hawkman delivers.

133
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,174
Just my size.

134
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,134
Gotcha.

135
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,392
Stay put, Rookie.

136
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,185
Wish I had a jetpack.

137
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,235
Man, do I have to do
everything around here?

138
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,113
Let me show you how a real
hero does it.

139
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,704
Say hello to my little friend
who's really big, and it's me.

140
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,956
Wow, look, Superman...

141
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,209
Guy Gardner finally made
something as big as his ego.

142
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,340
Say hello to the agony of the feet.

143
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,766
Ow.

144
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,437
Flash to Batman, I'm hot on
the trail of Captain Cold.

145
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,230
Get it? Hot, cold, huh?

146
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,150
I don't like tailgaters.

147
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,318
Hmm.

148
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,204
All right.

149
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,622
Cool off in the icebox.

150
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,548
Ha ha ha.
My favorite time of year: Duck season.

151
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,640
Green Arrow to Batman.

152
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,435
This Penguin is poached.

153
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,776
Plastic Man versus Deathstroke?
That's a stretch.

154
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,616
Whoo! That was close. Aah!

155
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,704
Aah!
Oh.

156
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:19,088
Plas to Batman, I've got mine
all wrapped up. Hee haw!

157
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,053
Wrapping things up here too.

158
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,973
Superman to Batman.

159
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,975
How's it going with that big gorilla?

160
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,896
Need any help?
I don't need any help from you.

161
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,525
Look, a monkey.

162
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,066
Thanks, Batman.

163
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,277
Hey, now, great takedown.

164
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,239
But, you know, maybe next time, instead
of using children to stop supervillains...

165
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,449
Feel free to call on your friends.

166
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:32,996
I keep my friends close
and my enemies closer.

167
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,876
I hope not much closer than this.
Hey, you're not implying that...

168
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,628
We caught Gorilla Groddy
And now we're gonna party

169
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,631
Villains going to prison 'Cause
the Justice League is winning

170
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,133
Booyah, yeah

171
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,688
Great work out there, everyone.

172
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:02,191
Especially our two new recruits:
Cyborg and Guy.

173
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,278
The Man of Steel just said I did great.
Fist bump.

174
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,488
I don't fist bump.

175
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,450
Just glad I was there
to save Wonder Woman.

176
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:15,371
Was that before or after Giganta
laid you down for a nap, rookie?

177
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,539
Hmm.
Whoa.

178
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,751
When we join forces,
no evil can match us.

179
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,253
That's why we formed the
Justice League.

180
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:28,009
Together we fight for the liberties of
all living creatures, great and small.

181
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,512
I joined the league to keep an eye
on the most powerful being on Earth.

182
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,223
The hearts and minds of man
are no mystery to me.

183
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,851
But an alien Superman....

184
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,356
Good thing I have my "Just In
Case" box of kryptonite.

185
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,154
I'm okay.
Not sure what came over me there.

186
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,657
Must've eaten some bad
buffalo wings.

187
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,743
Now, where was I? Oh, yes, yes.
Next order of business.

188
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,037
Flash is bored, again.

189
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,665
Any ideas on some new
activities to keep him busy?

190
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,042
Archery.
Ice sculpture.

191
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,710
North American Duck Calls?

192
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,380
Ha, ha.
Huh?

193
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,308
Okay, what now? Ooh. Snack time.

194
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,644
A hero sandwich sounds good.
Let's eat.

195
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,521
Race you.
Birdseed burrito time.

196
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,272
Booyah!

197
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,817
Hmm.
Superman sure left in a big hurry.

198
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,864
Uh oh. Trouble alert.
Great Hera.

199
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:36,494
There are reports of Superman
attacking LexCorp in Metropolis?

200
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,834
Aha! I knew he would snap one day.

201
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,962
I tried to warn everyone,
but no one would listen.

202
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,130
Uh....

203
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,340
We were just making sandwiches.

204
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,301
Don't think I won't check
that alibi.

205
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,390
I have a pretty good idea
of who's behind this.

206
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,810
Why don't I just take care
of this one solo, Guys?

207
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,105
I don't think so. Let's go.

208
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,864
What a mess.

209
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,324
I'd hate to be the guy
who's responsible for this.

210
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,704
Yeah, really, Guys,
I've totally got this.

211
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,999
And miss all the action? Uh uh.

212
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:40,183
Oh, look.
Guns, guns, and more guns.

213
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,809
Is this a villain lair?

214
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,979
Oh, it's my first villain lair.
Ha, ha.

215
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,900
It seems Lex has been busy
plotting our demise.

216
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,653
Even Superman's.

217
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,823
Hmm. Mm hm.

218
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,950
All right.

219
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,619
Okay.

220
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,412
Ah.

221
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,081
Hmm.

222
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,666
Lex may be onto something
with this one.

223
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,169
And the directions are very
easy to follow.

224
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,340
Ah, Batman, leave it to you to
dispose of Lex's evil plans for me.

225
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,926
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

226
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,597
Took you long enough.

227
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,808
My lab is practically destroyed.

228
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,893
Lex Luthor.

229
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,895
Do we really have to help this guy?

230
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,481
What's that supposed to mean?

231
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,109
Hello? Villain lair?

232
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,195
You spend all day creating
weapons to destroy us.

233
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,448
Hades himself would spurn you,
you treacherous snake.

234
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,118
How many times have you framed
one of us for a crime...

235
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,954
And then run for president
on a platform to stop us?

236
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,873
That reminds me.

237
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,668
Vote for Lex.

238
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,759
That's going to look great on posters.
Now, stop him.

239
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,599
Bizarro.

240
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,685
Another alien.

241
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,853
Whoa.

242
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,688
Are you twins?

243
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,899
Heh, heh. We are not twins.

244
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,864
Great Scott, the LexCorp
duplicator ray that created you.

245
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,700
You broke in here to steal it?
But why?

246
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,036
Bizarro show you.
Bizarro, don't!

247
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,137
Ugh!

248
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,905
I Batzarro. World's worst detective.

249
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,783
I Greenzarro. And I scared.

250
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,704
I...

251
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,917
Cyzarro.

252
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,338
I Bizarra. Pretty, Pretty Princess.

253
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,929
Bizarro, give me that ray
before you do any more damage.

254
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,890
Nothing stop Bizarro.

255
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,309
Not even Superman.

256
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,232
Can we go? I scared.

257
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,401
Okay. Let's stay.

258
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,659
You heard Bizarro. Stay.

259
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,994
Hmm.

260
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,999
"B-O-M-B."

261
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,210
Boom.

262
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,643
That was weird.

263
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,021
Your twin brother was way out
of line there, Superman.

264
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:18,109
The universe only needs one Guy Gardner.
If that.

265
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,821
How do we know this wasn't always
part of your secret alien plan?

266
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,407
Because Bizarro can't keep secrets.

267
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,450
He can barely keep his pants up.

268
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,411
But why make duplicates of us?

269
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,664
Duplicates with terrible hair
and unplucked eyebrows?

270
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,209
I don't know, but if one Bizarro
can cause this much destruction...

271
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,713
Think of what an entire
Bizarro League could do.

272
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,048
And I think I know where
they're going.

273
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,050
Bizarro World.

274
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,635
Let's go.

275
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:49,557
So you want us to follow you
to some distant planet, huh?

276
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:54,228
Well, I'll play your little
game for now, Alien.

277
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,693
This is just great.

278
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,280
They destroy my lab and Bizarro
takes the kryptonite bomb...

279
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,075
I was going to destroy
Superman with.

280
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,959
Ow.

281
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,051
Merciful Minerva.

282
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,636
Bizarro's planet's a cube?

283
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,597
Figures.

284
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,978
I should warn you,
things here behave a little...

285
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,772
Uh, Bizarro?

286
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,032
Ha! One Green Lantern rescue
rocket coming up.

287
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,664
A chicken?

288
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,875
Why does that not surprise me?

289
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,213
Hey, at least I can still fly,
Wonderless Woman.

290
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,760
Ugh!

291
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,263
Chicken. How degrading.

292
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,392
Yeah, I call that use of power
ring a clear "Foul."

293
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,685
Get it? Fowl? Ha, ha.

294
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:21,315
This strange planet shows no
evidence of animals or plants.

295
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,984
Well, there's a face plant. Heh.

296
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,323
These rocks are emitting
a weird form of radiation.

297
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,535
Ooh. We should call it
weirdiation, then.

298
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,786
I like that name.

299
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,289
It's this radiation...
I do not know what you are talking about.

300
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,917
Radiation? There are so many kinds.

301
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,003
If only there was a way to
differentiate this particular...

302
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,549
Fine. It's this weirdiation
that created the planet...

303
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,635
And is now interfering with
the team's powers and equipment.

304
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,471
Equipment?
That's what I'm made of.

305
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,848
Oh, there goes my arm.

306
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,309
Hey, why doesn't this place affect you?
Well, not much does, I guess.

307
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,104
So the Kryptonian
has lured us to a planet...

308
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,523
That renders our powers
and weapons useless...

309
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,651
While he remains unaffected.

310
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,821
Well, I have something
that will affect him.

311
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,823
Hmm.

312
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,784
Shh. We're being watched.

313
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,204
What do you want?

314
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,835
I think he wants to know
why you're talking to a rock.

315
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,503
It's a citizen.

316
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,589
A citizen?

317
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,260
I tried to make this place
feel more like home for Bizarro.

318
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,305
But he seems to have taken it
to another level.

319
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,352
It's a wacked out Metropolis.

320
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,688
A Bizarrotropolis.

321
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,440
I like to make up funny names.

322
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,819
I hear something.

323
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,613
I'm going to investigate.

324
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,656
Not without me, you're not.

325
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,456
That looks like fun.

326
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,292
Oh, man.

327
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,878
Beautiful from up here, isn't it?

328
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,423
Oh, and unless you want us both to
fall and become super pancakes...

329
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,384
I'd keep your lead box full
of kryptonite closed tight...

330
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,386
Bruce Wayne. Ha, ha.

331
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,806
I knew you'd use your x-ray vision on me.
But how did you see...

332
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,018
Through my lead lined mask?
I can't.

333
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,117
But I can see that
somebody stitched your

334
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:25,256
name onto the elastic
band of your underwear.

335
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,274
Alfred.

336
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,817
Oh, come on.

337
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,028
You can trust me with your
secret identity.

338
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,279
I'm Superman.

339
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,033
I don't trust anyone.
Also, you're an invulnerable alien...

340
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,037
Whose motives remain mysterious which
means I should especially not trust you...

341
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,747
Clark Kent.

342
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,291
Hey, how did you know my
secret identity?

343
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,377
I'm Batman.

344
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,756
That's the source of the
sound I heard earlier.

345
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,427
Darkseid.

346
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,857
Must save citizens from big
head machine.

347
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,376
Oh, my doll.

348
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,600
Desaad, who is stealing my rocks?

349
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,686
Why, no one, Master Darkseid.

350
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,023
This is only a minor interference.
I'm taking care of it as we speak.

351
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:57,823
This heinous host of hideous
heroes seems familiar.

352
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:02,119
No matter.
Parademons, unleash the drones.

353
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,600
It tickle. It tickle.

354
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,909
They're being tickled?
Tickled to death.

355
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,807
Aah! Superman?

356
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,559
Superman is here?

357
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,436
And Batman.

358
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,355
They have unexpectedly joined forces.

359
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,525
Aah! Oh, they must know our plan.

360
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,900
I didn't say anything, I swear.
I know I can

361
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:19,054
be a gossip, but they
didn't hear it from me.

362
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,948
Unless my mother said something.

363
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,533
Crush them.

364
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,201
As you wish, My Lord.

365
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,036
Crushing them as we speak.

366
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,373
Crush, crush, crush.

367
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,723
Yes! We've crushed them.

368
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,224
We've squished them.

369
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,226
Squished them into jelly, master.

370
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,812
Ooh, jelly. Maybe I could
spread them on my toast.

371
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,774
Huh?

372
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,067
Where's my jelly?

373
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,153
Huh. Hmm.

374
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:05,576
Master Darkseid, the jelly...
I mean, the heroes have vanished.

375
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,244
Vaporized. Pulverized.

376
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,913
Atomized. Victimized.

377
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,749
We'll probably never see them again.

378
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,376
Probably. Maybe. Definitely?

379
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,046
Then there are more stones to collect.

380
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,299
Yes.

381
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,927
More stones, more stones,
more stones.

382
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,155
Ugh.
Hmm?

383
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:47,159
Good thinking. Creating a tunnel
for us to escape into saved us all.

384
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,119
Was that a compliment?

385
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:54,625
Aah! No. The alien clearly has some sort
of mind control power I'm unaware of.

386
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,835
Must keep my wits about me.

387
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,170
Nice.

388
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,799
You managed to find these
Bizarro knuckleheads on your own.

389
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,050
Man.

390
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,178
Ugh. Why does this planet
keep tripping me up?

391
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,931
You am pretty, like Bizarra.

392
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,938
Ha! She is the spitting image
of you, princess. Ha ha ha.

393
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,231
Hey. Who...?

394
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,984
You make good hiding place
for Greenzarro.

395
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,903
Oh, boy.

396
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:27,241
Huh? Me am help you. Ha ha ha.

397
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,368
Thanks, I got it.

398
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,996
Now that we've found them, what
are we gonna do with these Bizarros?

399
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,291
We're actually dealing with something
much bigger than Superma...

400
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,877
I mean, Bizarro now.

401
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,087
Darkseid.

402
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,672
Darkseid?

403
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,632
I'm guessing that's a bad thing.

404
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,010
Oh, he's just the most dangerous
force in the universe.

405
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,387
Yipe!

406
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:52,099
Is that why you stole the Bizarro
Ray and created your own league?

407
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,475
To stop Darkseid?

408
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:58,522
Bizarro wanted to protect his
citizens from big head machine.

409
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,609
Big head machine
already take many citizens.

410
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,820
You should have come to me
first, Bizarro.

411
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,780
We can help you against Darkseid.

412
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,032
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

413
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,536
Easy for you to say,
Mr. I've Still Got My Powers.

414
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,413
Are you sure you're not
scared, Guy?

415
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,331
We're talking about rocks, Princess.

416
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,334
Why risk our behinds
for meaningless rocks?

417
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,923
Rocks my only friends
after Superman send me away.

418
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,511
I sent you here because...
Because you embarrassed by Bizarro.

419
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,513
So you hide him.

420
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,933
No, I...

421
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,269
They may just be rocks...

422
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,690
But I suspect Darkseid wants to harvest
their unique properties for a weapon.

423
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,234
Weirdiation.
Why make a weapon out of something...

424
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,904
That messes up everything
it comes in contact with?

425
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,365
Because it messes up everything
it comes in contact with.

426
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,576
Harnessing the power of this weirdiation...

427
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:57,247
Could render Earth's defenses,
it's heroes, useless.

428
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,540
Just like Guy.

429
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,000
Hey.

430
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,502
If Darkseid's after these rocks...

431
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,089
Then he's headed to the
greatest concentration of them:

432
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,635
Bizarrotropolis.

433
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,606
I have a plan. I'm going to reconstruct
the blocks of these vehicles...

434
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:26,109
To create a thermodynamic
amplifier of the Bizarro Ray.

435
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,623
When fired at Darkseid's
weirdiation supply, it

436
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:30,847
will create a new opposite
form of matter...

437
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,909
And the two will annihilate
each other, destroying his ship.

438
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,119
That make no sense.

439
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,830
All I hear is, "Blah, blah, blah...

440
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,458
Science, blah, big word."

441
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,836
I have better plan.

442
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,256
First, we take nap.

443
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,634
Yay! Nap.

444
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,598
I think we should go with
Batman's plan.

445
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,772
Thank you for meeting Bizarro
for talk in his special place.

446
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,857
You am excellent listener.

447
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,610
Bizarro not feel helpful to
Justice League.

448
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,613
Bizarro not helpful to anyone.
Ahem.

449
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,615
Huh?

450
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,579
Something bothering you?
On Earth, I bad hero...

451
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,874
on Bizarro world, I bad hero.

452
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,378
All I want is save day like Superman.

453
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,213
Oh. Oh, uh... Ugh.

454
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,881
Sorry.

455
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,426
Uh. Aw.

456
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,596
The Justice League will save
the day, Bizarro. I promise.

457
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,975
No.

458
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,770
Bizarro save day.

459
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,194
Darkseid.

460
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,240
We've got to buy Batman some time.
Let's go.

461
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,205
Ha, ha.
This is gonna make you laugh.

462
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,084
Superman apparently was not crushed
when we were doing all that crushing.

463
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,919
Neither was anyone else.

464
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,212
Please don't hurt me.

465
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,800
I will deal with them myself.

466
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,748
By Athena's gray eyes,
she is a dog of war.

467
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,876
Then why is my guy such a pussycat?

468
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,503
Why can't you be more like her?

469
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,881
Come on. You can do it.

470
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,343
I believe in you. You're a Lantern.

471
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,890
Ha!

472
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,185
Still not working.

473
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,356
No!

474
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,198
That's what I'm talking about.

475
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,326
They better watch out
for Darkseid's Omega Beams.

476
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,702
What are Omega Beams?

477
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,839
Those are Omega Beams.

478
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,173
Got it.

479
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,221
Superman, we meet again.

480
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,611
You know, Darkseid,
my mother used to say:

481
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:00,782
"Heroes get the cake
and bullies get the rake."

482
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,535
I'm still not entirely sure
what that all meant...

483
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:07,747
But we'll never let you harness the
power of this planet, you space bully.

484
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,082
I will.

485
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:15,964
And after Earth falls, the
entire universe will bow to me.

486
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,800
I don't think so.

487
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,346
Oh, the cape. Oh, the face.

488
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,560
I need more time, Superman.

489
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,521
Time?

490
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,233
Time is now purple o'clock.
Heh, heh.

491
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,000
I can break for you.

492
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,544
That's what we're worried about.

493
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,088
Aah.

494
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,849
Go, Cyzarro, break now.

495
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,857
He did it.

496
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,150
He fixed it.

497
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:22,239
Of course. Only a Bizarro
can make technology work here.

498
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,116
Take this.

499
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,577
Ugh!
And this.

500
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,704
And one of these too.
Ugh.

501
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,122
Uh oh.

502
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,168
Ugh! Not fun.

503
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,420
You're too late, Superman.

504
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:42,592
I now have enough of this bizarre
energy to rule the galaxy.

505
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,977
Well, on Bizarro World,
rules are meant to be broken.

506
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:01,194
Bizarro save day.

507
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,405
Bizarro, stop!

508
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,842
A kryptonite bomb.

509
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,011
Thank you.

510
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:38,815
Desaad, let us test our
weapon on Earth.

511
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,561
Hawkman and hawk jet, inbound.

512
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,106
Deploying hawk swords.

513
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,235
Pressing hawk button.

514
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,116
Hawk shield deployed.

515
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,198
Hawkman, did you intercept the ray?

516
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,960
You could say that.

517
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,261
Hawkman is holding off the ray...

518
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:55,475
But I suspect even his armor will
eventually fall to the weirdiation.

519
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,732
Bizarro tried to help.

520
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,735
Yeah, you helped, all right.
You helped Darkseid.

521
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,488
Thanks to you, we're done.
Earth is toast.

522
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,698
Without Superman,
we can't stop him.

523
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,327
Yes. Yes, you can.

524
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,956
Darkseid's ship is somehow being
protected from the weirdiation.

525
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,167
But if we overload the ship
with those crazy rocks....

526
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,672
Huh? But that'll just
make his weapon stronger.

527
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,050
So this is how you destroy us all.

528
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,177
You need to trust me, Batman.

529
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,723
Trust you?

530
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:49,904
Well, if there's one place I can try
trusting you, it's on a backwards world.

531
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,616
No. Those are Bizarro's people.

532
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,410
His friends.

533
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,289
I know, Bizarro,
but you have new friends now.

534
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,792
Huh? Ah.

535
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,378
Heh.
And an old one too.

536
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,632
Superman Bizarro's friend?

537
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,718
Not just friends, Bizarro.

538
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,013
Brothers.
And I should've been a better one to you.

539
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,764
Twin brothers?

540
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,393
Fraternal, but, yes, Twin.

541
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,320
Goodbye. Bizarro miss you.

542
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,805
I miss you.

543
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,768
Especially you with pointy head.

544
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,108
What are they doing?

545
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,695
They're overloading the system.

546
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,576
Goodbye, special place.

547
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,011
We lose. Heh, heh.

548
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,016
Activate the boom tube.

549
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,686
Yes, Sire!

550
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,071
Must keep pressing button.

551
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,906
So hard.

552
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,413
Huh?

553
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,082
Uh....

554
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,920
How attached are Earthlings
to a round moon?

555
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,635
Superman A-okay.

556
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,304
That's great.

557
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,180
He's gonna be all right, then?

558
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:25,560
No.
Batzarro means we can't save him.

559
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,104
Goodbye, Kal.

560
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,480
Gonna miss you, Pal.

561
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,941
Wish I could've learned more
from you.

562
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,528
Superman live.

563
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,488
Stop with the opposite talk, Man.

564
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:41,367
No. Superman live.

565
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,252
He's drawing the kryptonite
radiation from his body.

566
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,921
And because he's Bizarro,
it doesn't affect him.

567
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,114
You saved the day, Bizarro.

568
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,617
Bad job.
Terrible work.

569
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,994
You're a loser. Heh.

570
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,622
Thanks.

571
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,084
You had me scared for a second, Buddy.
Scared?

572
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,293
Knew it.

573
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,380
Booyah!
Darkseid on the run and the Earth is safe.

574
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,173
Justice League does it again.

575
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,925
Fist bump.

576
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,513
I'm not wrong often,
but I was about you.

577
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,390
You can be trusted.

578
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,433
Really? Wow.

579
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,603
Then I guess you won't need
that box of kryptonite anymore.

580
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,313
Let's not go crazy.

581
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,649
If we're gonna have a wild
card on the team...

582
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,736
Who can't stop keeping tabs
on me, I'm glad it's you.

583
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,700
Whoa. Look at this place.

584
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,370
Bizarro lost whole world.

585
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,624
Then we're just gonna
have to rebuild it together.

586
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,015
Hmm, great job.

587
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,184
In fact,
the whole place looks wonderful.

588
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,478
I can't wait to walk
through that front door.

589
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:36,107
Hmm. Front door.

590
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:49,537
So the heroes managed to
survive Bizarro World. Hooray.

591
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,749
But even the mighty Justice
League cannot hope to survive...

592
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,293
Operation Doom.
