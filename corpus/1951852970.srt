1
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,934
Heather Wolfe, I presume.

2
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:20,267
Yeah. Professor Schiller.
I can't believe it's you.

3
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,307
I can't believe it's me either.
Please, sit down.

4
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,147
What'll you have, Professor?

5
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,287
You go first.

6
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,286
I'll have a BLT and a cup of coffee.

7
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,152
And I'd like a baked potato, no salt...

8
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,760
No butter, no sour cream. I know.

9
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,159
Tea, skim milk, no sugar.

10
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,662
Thank you, Dolores.

11
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,431
I'm not allowed to put butter
on anything anymore.

12
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,968
I had a heart attack
last year. I had surgery.

13
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,163
They cracked me open like a lobster.

14
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,370
Oh, that must have been very scary.

15
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,635
Well, it did tend to concentrate the mind.

16
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,007
I can imagine.

17
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,374
So...

18
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,972
...you've embarked on a project
of questionable merit.

19
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,052
You're doing a study on me.

20
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,313
I think it's a very worthy project.

21
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,184
I'm flattered by your interest.

22
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,848
But I'm afraid I can't be able of any help.

23
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,460
Why not?

24
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,722
- Miss Wolfe...
- Heather.

25
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,991
I'm trying to finish a novel.

26
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,658
My one remaining goal
in life is to finish it.

27
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,863
I'm not in good health and
I just can't afford to spend time...

28
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,464
...discussing four old novels
that aren't even in print any more.

29
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,078
The Sound and the Fury would have
gone out of print in the 40's...

30
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,738
...if Malcolm Cowley hadn't published
The Portable Faulkner.

31
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,283
And you're going to save me
from obscurity with a Portable Schiller?

32
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,979
- Is that the idea?
- Something like that.

33
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,886
I've had several pieces published, most
recently on Stanley Elkin in Illuminata.

34
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,925
- Maybe you saw it?
- No I haven't.

35
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,562
It's not a question of my doubting you...

36
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:55,031
...it's just that I must avoid anything
that will distract me from my own work.

37
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,968
And your project, however flattering,
is really a distraction.

38
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,335
So I'm afraid I must say no.

39
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,872
May I ask one favor?

40
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,918
If I do have a copy,
it would be in my bedroom.

41
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,257
Do you think I could have a look
at the room where you write?

42
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,924
Well...

43
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,169
I suppose so.
It's those doors behind you.

44
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,762
Don't touch anything.

45
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,237
Hello?

46
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,237
Are you a burglar?

47
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,336
Not professionally.

48
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,105
Well, it's good to have a hobby.

49
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,647
I found it.

50
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:24,875
- Oh, hello, darling.
- Hi.

51
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,310
Heather, this is my daughter, Ariel.

52
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,651
Ariel, this is Heather Wolfe.
She's writing her master's thesis...

53
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,918
...for some unknown reason, about me.

54
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,528
Well, here's that copy of The Lost City.

55
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,028
It's like a sacred text.

56
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:42,263
I believe there's only one
copy of it left in the world.

57
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,230
Thank you.

58
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,702
I can't believe I left
my copy in Providence.

59
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,535
But I can return this next week
when I go back for the rest of my things.

60
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,734
Fine. You can leave it with the doorman.

61
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,539
So, Dad, are we still on for movie night?

62
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,806
I picked up Notorious and
The Shop Around The Corner.

63
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,076
Would you mind terribly if I took
a rain check? I really have a lot of work.

64
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,413
No problem. I was in
the neighborhood giving a private.

65
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,613
So I should get out of your way.
I'm interrupting...

66
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,849
No, it's alright.
Heather was just about to leave.

67
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,291
Oh, yeah. I got to fight
that traffic back to Hoboken.

68
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,429
- You have a car?
- Yeah. Do you need a ride?

69
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,555
That would be great.
Give me two minutes.

70
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,699
Alright.

71
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,042
I respect your decision,
Professor Schiller...

72
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,984
...but I can't help but think that
you've made up your mind too quickly.

73
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,522
Young lady, I haven't done
anything too quickly in years.

74
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,182
Maybe the best thing for your health...

75
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,590
...would be to have a fascinating
young woman in your life.

76
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,728
Miss Wolfe.

77
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,467
Promise me you'll give me a chance.

78
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,083
So, what's it like to be
the daughter of a great writer?

79
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,551
You think he's a great writer?

80
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,689
Don't you?

81
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,484
Yeah, but he's my father.

82
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,788
The truth is, I'm not really much of a
reader. I'm more of an action person.

83
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,361
That's right, you're a dancer.

84
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,159
Yes. You read about me
in his second novel...

85
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,757
...the difficult birth,
the tumultuous childhood...

86
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,599
...the unquenchable desire to dance.

87
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,034
So are you still dancing?

88
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,768
No. I teach pilates,
and yoga, and exercise.

89
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,673
That's what happens
to dancers when they die.

90
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,177
Right up here, this is just fine.

91
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,375
Thank you for the lift.

92
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,987
I'm going to reintroduce
your father's work to the world.

93
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:46,182
I know an editor at the University of
Chicago Press who's very interested.

94
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,451
Cool.

95
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,118
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too. Okay.

96
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,468
- Hey, listen, it's not as bad as Chicago.
- Casey Davis, back in town.

97
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,301
Very good to have you back.

98
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,041
- Great to see you.
- Alright, thank you.

99
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,540
- Bye.
- Bye.

100
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,161
<i>I have two Casey Davises.
A Dr. Casey Davis on Fifth Avenue.</i>

101
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,298
No.

102
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,491
<i>And a Casey Davis on 107th Street.</i>

103
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,033
Is that a new listing?

104
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,227
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

105
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,428
I'll take it.

106
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:37,373
<i>The number is 646-555-4325.</i>

107
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,063
"Now he understood that our birth
into the world of the body...

108
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,469
...is only our first birth,
and by no means the most important.

109
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,601
He was labor, this beautiful labor,
on his second birth.

110
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,742
He was undoing the threads
that kept him bound to the body.

111
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:21,819
To dissolve them
was to become a creature of light.

112
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,481
He thought about one of the threads
and it dissolved.

113
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,093
He never knew that liberation
could be so simple...

114
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,754
...so full of joy."

115
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,438
Charles.

116
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,442
Leonard Schiller.
It's been forever. How are you?

117
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,774
I can't complain.
How are things over at GRB?

118
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,781
Oh, I left there 15 years ago.
I'm at Mulberry.

119
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,441
Well, that's very impressive.

120
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,713
Yeah, you know,
a little hard work. A lot of luck.

121
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,050
But how are you? Are you still writing?

122
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,317
Well, yes. Yes, of course.

123
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,122
As a matter of fact, I'm just putting
the finishing touches on my new novel.

124
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,993
I'd really be happy to send it over
to you as soon as it's finished.

125
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,624
Leonard, I respect you
too much to blow smoke.

126
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:14,466
This business has turned into
the film industry. It's all about the name.

127
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,632
Literary novels are such
a tough sell, anyway.

128
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,401
It would be hard
to get anyone on board.

129
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,409
To tell you the truth,
most of the business...

130
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,946
...is celebrity confessions
and self-help books.

131
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,141
Right. Well, I understand.

132
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,212
It's good to see you.

133
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,615
You too, Charles.

134
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,976
It was really nice meeting you.

135
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,982
Alright, take care. Bye bye.

136
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,722
She's a friend of yours?

137
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,257
No. Just another woman nearing 40
obsessed with her biological clock.

138
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,361
You know, you have
the same gift your mother had.

139
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,056
That ability to strike up
a conversation with complete strangers.

140
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,861
Yeah, except Mom made a career of it.
I'm just a blabbermouth.

141
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,595
You'd be a wonderful therapist yourself.

142
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,332
You used to talk about going
back to school to become one.

143
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,409
Let's be honest, Dad. The time for
going back to school has passed me by.

144
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,343
Oh, that's nonsense, Ariel. You're
so young. You're so full of potential.

145
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,881
It's a little late to be talking potential.

146
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,611
That grad student Heather.
Now, she's young. She has potential.

147
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,754
What time is it?

148
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,422
It's 9:30.

149
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,285
9:30. I got to go see Victor.

150
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,360
Oh, Victor's back in the picture.
Well, that's good.

151
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,963
I always liked Victor.
He's a very decent man.

152
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,621
He's kind. He's hard-working.

153
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,097
Maybe you should marry him.

154
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,499
Well, if I were nearing 40
and anxious to start a family...

155
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,696
...I probably would. He's a good catch.

156
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,297
Not every guy I've dated in the past
five years has been a good catch, right?

157
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,967
Every guy but Casey.

158
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,909
I make no apologies of
my opinion of Casey.

159
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,847
I wish him a long and prosperous life,
so long as he prospers in Chicago.

160
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,850
And I'm sure you don't
feel any differently.

161
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,717
No. I don't. Do you want to share
a cab with me? I have to go.

162
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,915
You go ahead, darling.
I'm going to stay and browse.

163
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,082
Okay.

164
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,220
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

165
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,440
It must be so creepy
being around drug dealers all day.

166
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,706
Your neck is a mass of knots.

167
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,442
The drug dealers
are actually the nice guys.

168
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,384
They're always polite.
They never tell you they're innocent.

169
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,114
Tell me something, Victor.

170
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,055
Why did you become a lawyer?

171
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,128
I was deeply in love
with the majesty of the law.

172
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,197
Really?

173
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,800
Yeah, right. I was an English major.

174
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,335
What's an English major
going to do in the real world? Nothing.

175
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,938
So I went to law school.

176
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:58,426
What's up? Stay. I'll make you
French toast for breakfast.

177
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,863
No, I can't. I have a 7:30
in the morning. I got to get home.

178
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,846
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

179
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,212
<i>Hello?</i>

180
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,486
<i>Anybody there?</i>

181
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,799
I'm so glad you called.

182
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,372
It was an unexpected surprise.

183
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,664
Please come in.

184
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,471
When you were writing Tenderness,
were you reading a lot of D.H. Lawrence?

185
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,345
A New York Jew imitates
D.H. Lawrence at his own peril.

186
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,078
Oh, no, I didn't say you imitated him.

187
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,085
But you do remind me of him...

188
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,419
...in the way that you give your
characters room to reject things.

189
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,825
Like in Tenderness, you allow Ellen
to walk away from her marriage...

190
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,989
...without ever portraying her as cruel.

191
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,829
She did what she needed to do.

192
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,631
Yes, that's what I mean.
That you give your characters freedom.

193
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,295
It's not mine to give.

194
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,007
What I give them is
the freedom to find their own way.

195
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,119
So when you start a book,
do you have the story clearly in mind?

196
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,659
No. Never. I wish I did.

197
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,991
I always start with a character.

198
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:46,397
In Tenderness I had a picture of a woman
being asked to leave a museum...

199
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,836
...because she'd run her hand
over one of the statues.

200
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,407
And I had no idea who she was...

201
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,136
...or why she was touching the statue.

202
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,303
I wrote the book to find out.

203
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,812
How do you find out?

204
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,416
You follow the characters around...

205
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,212
...waiting for them
to do something interesting.

206
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,016
Sometimes they do so right away.
Sometimes...

207
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,558
...I follow them around for months...

208
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,787
...only to find that they don't do
anything interesting at all.

209
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,223
Is that what's taking you so long
to finish your current novel?

210
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,697
I think it would be
in your interest to know...

211
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,173
...you've just hit upon the worst
question you could ask a writer.

212
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,648
The book is taking so long...

213
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:35,049
...because following
one's characters around takes stamina.

214
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,917
I'm old. I'm having trouble keeping up.

215
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,526
I notice you've made several
references to being old.

216
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,756
I can't help but wonder if you're using
your age to mask a deeper conflict?

217
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,068
Miss Wolfe.

218
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,733
I agreed to assist you in your enterprise...

219
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,706
...because you strike me
as a serious young woman.

220
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:01,505
However, this is our first interview,
and there is such a thing as decorum.

221
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,704
Point taken.

222
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,885
However, should you encounter
any shortcomings in my thesis...

223
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,512
...I hope you wouldn't allow me
to use my youth as a defense.

224
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,752
Okay, then.

225
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,123
Point taken.

226
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,162
Are you sure about this, Dad? Won't
this be a distraction from your book?

227
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:30,366
Not necessarily. She seems like
a very intelligent young woman.

228
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,034
Well, I'm sure she is,
but you've always been so inflexible...

229
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,305
...about letting anything
take you away from your work.

230
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,971
And you've argued convincingly...

231
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,311
...that a little deviation
may be exactly what I need.

232
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,318
Oh, Dad, I meant a few extra laps
around the reservoir.

233
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,447
Well, I appreciate
your looking after me, darling...

234
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,592
...but don't worry.

235
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,662
It's just a few interviews,
and off she goes.

236
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,594
Oh, by the way...

237
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:57,133
...an old student of mine is having
a book release party on Saturday.

238
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,395
Would you like to come?

239
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,198
I can't. I have a date with Victor.

240
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,399
Oh, I'm glad you're keeping
an open mind about him.

241
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,774
Well, Dad, seeing that
I'm nearing the big Four-O...

242
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,144
...I've decided to make a bold move.
I'm going to have a baby.

243
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,013
Oh, that's wonderful.

244
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,484
I'm so happy for you.

245
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,687
I must confess, I'm a bit surprised.

246
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,689
The last time we spoke...

247
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,817
...you didn't seem
very enthusiastic about Victor.

248
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,293
I'm not. He doesn't know about it.

249
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,954
It's a solo project.

250
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,158
What do you mean, a solo project?

251
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,964
Dad, let's face the facts.
I'm not getting any younger.

252
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,506
If I can't have a family, I want to
have a child before it's too late.

253
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,576
So I've stopped taking
precautions with Victor...

254
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,905
...and hopefully
the stars will line up for me.

255
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,708
Ariel, darling, I sympathize
with your predicament...

256
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,910
...but you're acting out of desperation.
Not to mention the moral implications.

257
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,053
Here we go.

258
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,918
It's dishonest and a violation
of Victor's trust in you.

259
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,458
Well, Dad, maybe
the characters in your books...

260
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,325
...have the luxury of grappling with
moral issues, but I'm in the real world.

261
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,421
In Tenderness...

262
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,499
...you portray the breakdown of Ellen and
Ira's marriage with such brutal honesty...

263
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,762
...that it's tempting to assume
it's drawn from personal experience.

264
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,169
Miss Wolfe, the writer's words
are his fingerprints.

265
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,241
The writer himself should be forgotten.

266
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,174
Right, but you'd agree that knowing
what we do about Hemingway's life...

267
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,507
...informs any serious
discussion of his work.

268
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,512
Perhaps. But there's still no substitute...

269
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,916
...for two or three close readings
of The Sun Also Rises.

270
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,319
I've had many close readings
of all of your novels.

271
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,790
I still think that it might be
illuminating for us...

272
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,792
...to spend a little of our time together...

273
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,454
...discussing the man behind the words.

274
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,795
I thought this was meant to be
a critical analysis of my work...

275
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,459
...not a magazine profile.

276
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,937
Well, I'm looking for the theme
of my thesis, Professor.

277
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,941
And I think it's unfair of you to
accuse me of writing some puff piece...

278
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,604
...because I've asked you to discuss
any biographical origins of your fiction.

279
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,409
Well, my God.

280
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,279
Can't a writer draw from his life...

281
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,819
...without being accused
of autobiography?

282
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,422
Do you at least concede...

283
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,821
...that your first two novels
were more tied to you personally?

284
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,484
Well, now you're
answering your own question.

285
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,560
If you'll excuse me for a minute.

286
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,274
I'm a little tired.

287
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,537
Why don't we make this
your last question 'til next week.

288
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,376
Oh, of course.

289
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,547
Ellen in your first book...

290
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,092
...is very similar to Beth in your second.

291
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,093
And those women were
so ahead of their time...

292
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,755
...in how they refused
to sacrifice their lives...

293
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,799
...for the sake of their
husbands' happiness.

294
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:55,034
And then no character resembling her
appears in the next two, so...

295
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,232
...what happened to her?

296
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,174
She died late one evening...

297
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,906
...on an icy stretch
of the Taconic Parkway.

298
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,484
But Ellen doesn't die.
She moves to Paris...

299
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,823
I'm sorry.

300
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,853
That was insensitive of me.

301
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,889
Don't be sorry.
You had no way of knowing.

302
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,138
I concede this, Miss Wolfe.

303
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,611
I have, in my writing,
occasionally drawn from my own life.

304
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,244
But only in the spirit of objectivity.

305
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,574
You know, I never told you...

306
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,646
...why your books
are so important to me.

307
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,442
No.

308
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,977
Your novels set me free.

309
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,857
Growing up, you know,
I always felt like an alien.

310
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,052
I never really fit in anywhere,
especially not Cleveland Heights.

311
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:28,326
But I always found solace
in writing and books.

312
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,595
And then I had this English teacher
who encouraged me...

313
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:35,672
...to apply to this
early entrance program at Brown...

314
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,334
...where they allow you to skip
your last year of high school.

315
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,447
And I got in, but...

316
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,812
...I had this boyfriend, who was brilliant.

317
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,818
He was a brilliant writer and musician.

318
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,354
And at the prospect of my leaving...

319
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,481
...he really started coming apart.

320
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,628
And I had all but
made up my mind not to go.

321
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,493
So I did what I always do
in times of great uncertainty.

322
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,967
I went to the books.
I went to the library, and...

323
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,707
And that's when I found you.

324
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,772
I found Tenderness, and...

325
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,505
...I sat on the floor in the stacks...

326
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,344
...and I read the whole book.

327
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:23,318
And by the time I finished,
and the library was closing around me...

328
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,355
I knew what I had to do.

329
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,788
You decided to go to Brown.

330
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,450
Yeah.

331
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,522
You gave me the courage
to live my own life.

332
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,635
Freedom isn't the choice
the world encourages.

333
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,639
You have to wear
a suit of armor to defend it.

334
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,142
Yeah, you've always
explained my life to me...

335
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,409
...more sympathetically
than I could explain it to myself.

336
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,018
I'm glad I could be of
some small service.

337
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,711
What happened to the boyfriend?

338
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,683
Oh, he got over it.

339
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,889
Well, have patience.

340
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,998
It's the slowest elevator
on the Upper West Side.

341
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,097
Nice to have seen you.

342
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,588
<i>First unheard message.</i>

343
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,917
<i>Hello Heather, this is Leonard Schiller.</i>

344
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,589
<i>This Saturday evening I'll be
attending a book release party.</i>

345
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,257
<i>If you think you might
find the occasion of interest to you...</i>

346
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:47,428
<i>...you 're certainly welcome
to join me. Thank you. Bye.</i>

347
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,049
Oh, wait a second.

348
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,215
- Why?
- Wait a second.

349
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,359
Why?

350
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,360
What about your diaphragm?

351
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,201
Right.

352
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,190
There are some
heavy-hitters here, Leonard.

353
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,659
You didn't tell me
you move in such lofty circles.

354
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,128
Well, I'm not out of circulation yet.

355
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,995
That's Robert Randolph.
He wrote Time Out Of Mind.

356
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,295
I've never heard of it.

357
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,937
Oh, it's one of my favorite
books from last year.

358
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,597
You should read it. It's brilliant.

359
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,005
That's a nice tie,
by the way. Is that new?

360
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,237
No, I've had this for years.

361
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,811
Oh, my God.
Will you excuse me for a minute?

362
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,812
Hi. My name is Heather Wolfe...

363
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,948
...and you rejected
two of my book reviews.

364
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,889
Heather Wolfe.

365
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,795
I can't say I remember them.
I guess they weren't very good.

366
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:24,765
Well, I just wanted to tell you
I loved your article last spring...

367
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,838
...about Max's Kansas City. It was
the best piece in the Voice in years.

368
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,234
Thanks.

369
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,468
But I also thought you weren't saying
everything you knew about Lou Reed.

370
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,475
Maybe you were pulling your punches?

371
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,041
Maybe I do remember those reviews.

372
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,175
You're a graduate student
somewhere, aren't you?

373
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,150
Yeah, at Brown.

374
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,928
What is your master's thesis about?
She asked in trepidation.

375
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,262
It's a critical biography
of a great American novelist.

376
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,402
Who?

377
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,697
Him.

378
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,332
Who is he?

379
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,400
That's Leonard Schiller.

380
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,574
Tenderness?

381
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,414
The Lost City?

382
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,608
I know the name. He was
one of the New York intellectuals...

383
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,276
...Bellow, Schwartz.

384
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,614
To be honest, I was never
really interested in that crowd.

385
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,851
I imagine them as a bunch of
white guys in suits, going to bed early.

386
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,606
It's bad luck to make love
without knowing your fortune.

387
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,740
No, not that one. Try this one.
I have a good feeling about this one.

388
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,822
So, what does your fortune say?

389
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,164
Okay.

390
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,996
Maybe I moved too fast.

391
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,110
Let's table the whole marriage thing.
We'll go back to the way things were.

392
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,775
I'm sorry. I can't.

393
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,677
Don't be sorry. I just thought
we were good together.

394
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,616
Victor, it's not you. It's me.

395
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,746
Oh, I hate it when people say that
because they're usually lying.

396
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,824
I know. But I'm not.

397
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,184
Don't leave.

398
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,859
I have to.

399
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,520
Two minutes ago,
you couldn't take your hands off me.

400
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,794
Victor, I didn't put in my diaphragm.

401
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,371
Well, put it in now.

402
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,498
I didn't bring it with me.

403
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,803
I haven't brought it for weeks.

404
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,575
You've been trying to have my child...

405
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,810
...but now that I want to marry you,
you don't want to have a child with me?

406
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,320
You see, Victor it's not you.

407
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,946
It really is me.

408
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,857
Sandra, I assumed I'd see you
at the Vanity Fair bash.

409
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,800
I was just heading over.
Frederick, this is Heather Wolfe.

410
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,665
Hi, pleasure to meet you. You don't
have to introduce Leonard Schiller.

411
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,399
He and his wife were
dear friends of my parents.

412
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,704
I got your message, Professor.
Morally earnest as always.

413
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,270
Frederick was kind enough
to offer me a job writing ad copy.

414
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,280
Just a few paragraphs
about Central Park.

415
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,885
He didn't even have to mention
American Express.

416
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,081
I'm old-fashioned enough to believe
that art and commerce are at war.

417
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,955
I think that's inspiring.
To be that pure about your art.

418
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,586
I don't see what's so pure
about turning down paid work.

419
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,490
As if making a living means
you're guilty of selling your soul?

420
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,565
I make my living writing and,
until recently, teaching literature.

421
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,572
That's my world and I'm faithful to it.

422
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,235
Of course your magazine owes its
existence to advertising revenue.

423
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,109
I suppose there's nothing
wrong with that, but it's just...

424
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,444
...a compromise
that I'm not willing to make.

425
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,718
But that advertising revenue...

426
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,790
...allows us to introduce
new writing talent to the world.

427
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,416
I don't see the compromise in that.

428
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,331
Thank you for going out of your way.

429
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,937
Leonard, do you mind if I come up?
I have to use the little girl's room.

430
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,346
Well, then.

431
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,281
But you haven't fed me yet.

432
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,560
Oh, I thought you ate at the party.

433
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,632
A chunk of cheese and a cracker?
That will hardly do.

434
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,334
You look sad tonight.

435
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,668
The knight of the mournful countenance.

436
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,407
Honestly, I can't stop
thinking about my daughter.

437
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,217
She seems forever adrift...

438
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,290
...and I can't help but blame myself.

439
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:50,087
Her mother died when
Ariel was still in her teens...

440
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,287
...and I'm afraid
I didn't do very well after that.

441
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:57,390
I kept concerning myself
with the perfection of my work...

442
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,366
...and I reduced her to begging
for my time and attention.

443
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,378
You're very hard on yourself.

444
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:14,477
Sorry.

445
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,187
Sorry for getting honey on you.

446
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,982
You'll excuse me.

447
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,590
I'm sorry, but...

448
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,491
...I think it's time for you to go.

449
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,256
Oh, dear.

450
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,862
Did I do something wrong?

451
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,230
No, you've been very kind
to me. It's just...

452
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:14,995
...that I'm too old.

453
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,933
Please, I'm not being kind.

454
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,278
If you want me to go, I'll go, but...

455
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,373
...I'm not expecting anything from you.

456
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,371
Can we lie down?

457
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,734
We don't have to do anything.

458
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,436
I just want to be next to you.

459
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Howdy.

460
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,959
I should have called.

461
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,827
I'll call you tomorrow.

462
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,781
If we get into an accident and die,
I won't be able to tip you!

463
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,283
Fuck! Fuck! My purse. My purse!

464
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,556
Okay, excuse me.
Okay, I don't have my purse.

465
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,491
I'm sorry, I forgot my purse.
I don't have any money on me.

466
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,226
I'm sorry. I have no money.

467
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,632
If you don't have money,
I cannot drive you anywhere.

468
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,035
Good luck to you, miss.
I hope you locate your purse.

469
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,839
<i>Hello?</i>

470
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,845
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

471
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,245
<i>Ariel?</i>

472
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,924
How did you know it was me?

473
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,591
<i>I know your silence. Where are you?</i>

474
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,595
Twenty-ninth and Seventh.

475
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,732
<i>Nick's?</i>

476
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,866
Nick's.

477
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,263
<i>I'll see you in 20 minutes.</i>

478
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,695
I thought you were in California.

479
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,694
I thought you were in Chicago.

480
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,492
I just moved back.

481
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,168
Folks eating?

482
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,767
- No. Just coffee.
- Okay.

483
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,338
Hey, I haven't seen you kids in years.

484
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,410
Don't tell me you left us for another diner.

485
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,177
We didn't go for another diner. We just
moved out of the neighborhood, Nick.

486
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,083
Well, it's good to have you back.
Coffee's on me.

487
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:22,865
So...

488
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,132
What's new?

489
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,077
I joined the glee club.

490
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,274
- When?
- Just now.

491
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,025
Hello.

492
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,633
Coffee's ready.
I could make you something to eat.

493
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,435
Oh, no thanks. I never eat breakfast.

494
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,720
Oh, I love Narayan.

495
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,116
You've read him?

496
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:23,715
Oh, my God, yes.
He reminds me of Chekhov.

497
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,159
Not as tough-minded,
but more of a sense of humor.

498
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,401
What?

499
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,861
Nothing.

500
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,203
It's just nice to meet a young person...

501
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,935
...who wants to talk about
R.K. Narayan at 7:00 in the morning.

502
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,644
I've always thought that people would
still be reading him in a hundred years.

503
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,788
Do you think people will still be
reading you in a hundred years?

504
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,227
What I wonder is whether people will
still be reading in a hundred years.

505
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,161
No, but really,
don't you ever think about it?

506
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,699
If I do, it would be
unseemly to talk about.

507
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,998
It's got nothing to do with
what the whole enterprise is about.

508
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,635
What is the whole enterprise about?

509
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,706
It's not something I can put into words.

510
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,710
Not at 7:00 in the morning.

511
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,842
To put it bluntly, Leonard,
your novels are out of print.

512
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:25,978
You're not sure if anyone will publish
the one that you're working on now.

513
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,819
So why do you keep going?

514
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,653
Heather, what can I say?

515
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,854
Whatever I say will either
be too much or too little.

516
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,591
Yes, but when I'm
summing up my thesis...

517
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,861
...what should I say it is
that keeps you going?

518
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,062
Just say it's the madness of art.

519
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,736
The madness of art.

520
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:02,752
Hello, Davis.

521
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,752
Stop glowing at me, Schiller.

522
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,591
Oh, am I glowing?

523
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,731
You kept me up
half the night with your glowing.

524
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,036
I'd think she was scheming to get
in his will, but Dad doesn't have money.

525
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,047
Well, maybe she thinks he has money.

526
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,584
How could she get naked with him?

527
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,984
She's like 25. It's against nature.

528
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,784
Wow. Let your father have some fun.

529
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,116
What are you doing defending him?

530
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:40,856
I'm not defending him. I'm just saying,
you know, be glad he's happy.

531
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,795
I want him to be happy.

532
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,027
If she was a nice, old librarian,
I'd be delighted.

533
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,404
What's going on?

534
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,412
I know that look.

535
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,813
Ariel, before we get too far in again...

536
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:10,017
...I feel I should let you know that...

537
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,288
...I haven't changed
my position on having children.

538
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,166
- Really?
- Yeah.

539
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,428
I thought I should
let you know that right away...

540
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,300
...so there are no
misunderstandings later.

541
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,531
That's fair.

542
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,571
I would rather walk away right now...

543
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:31,237
...than risk the kind of pain
we went through last time.

544
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,881
So there are no misunderstandings later,
I haven't changed my position either.

545
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,999
But don't worry. I...

546
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,193
I'm just going to toy with you
for a couple of months...

547
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,805
...then leave you by the wayside,
begging for more.

548
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:01,610
But until then, let's just
keep things like they are right now.

549
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,610
Hot and light.

550
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,282
Okay?

551
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,015
- Thank you.
- Okay. Take care. Bye.

552
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,451
- Thank you.
- Okay, bye.

553
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,788
They adore you.

554
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,687
I can see it on their faces.
You inspire them.

555
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,389
Well, I taught them how to breathe.
It's amazing what a little oxygen will do.

556
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:25,262
- I left the keys in the side pocket.
- Okay, good.

557
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:29,303
About last night,
Heather wasn't feeling well...

558
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,838
...so I just let her sleep in the guest room.

559
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:34,501
That's what I figured. Give me five
minutes to freshen up, okay? Great.

560
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,579
Hey, Chelsea. Hey, that's my dad.

561
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,578
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

562
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,714
Okay, Dad, let's have it out.

563
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:46,914
Ariel.

564
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:52,189
This is a man who doesn't
want what you want...

565
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,196
...and he proved it
beyond a doubt five years ago.

566
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,857
Dad, that was a decision
Casey and I made together.

567
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,935
No, that was a decision Casey made.

568
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,938
If your opinion had mattered,
you'd have a five-year-old child by now.

569
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,666
That is a terrible thing to say.

570
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,277
The man left you
when you needed him most.

571
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,470
Dad, it's not that simple!

572
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,946
And now he has the gall
to waltz back into your life...

573
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,948
...and waste more of your valuable time.

574
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,279
I called him.

575
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,285
People don't change, Ariel.

576
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,754
Well, maybe not,
but we'll just have to see.

577
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,155
I was happy last night.
Doesn't that count for something?

578
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,227
No. No it doesn't.

579
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,490
Not when it leaves you so depressed
you can't get out of bed for a whole year.

580
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,566
That's not going to happen again.
I'm older now.

581
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:33,431
Yes, that's what worries me.

582
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,669
<i>"To sit across the table and talk
with someone you love...</i>

583
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,503
...is itself a complex engagement.

584
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,168
To go to bed with someone...

585
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,776
...to carry your conversation
into the realm of the body...

586
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:50,410
...a realm of insecurity and vulnerability
and fear, as well as pleasure...

587
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:54,115
...was always fraught with
the sad evidence of how difficult it is...

588
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:58,250
...to understand another person
and make yourself understood."

589
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,540
Thank you for inviting me.
She's a wonderful writer.

590
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,474
Yes, she is.

591
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,872
The excerpt she read
was very nicely observed, I thought.

592
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:24,348
Lucky break for me
Ariel couldn't make it.

593
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:27,889
To be honest,
I was surprised you were available.

594
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,825
Really. I assumed you'd be out with a
gentleman friend on a Friday evening.

595
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,293
I am out with a gentleman friend
on a Friday evening.

596
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,427
To tell you the truth, Leonard,
I find very few men my age interesting.

597
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:45,102
They're like chewing gum. Ten minutes
of flavor followed by bland repetition.

598
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,006
Oh, surely it can't be that bleak.

599
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,836
Don't get me wrong, I love
a good time as much as the next girl...

600
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,848
...but I have too much to do.
You know, I want to be bold.

601
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,818
I want to be like Joan Didion,
Joni Mitchell, Joan of Arc.

602
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,719
I guess I have the under 30 disease.

603
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,690
Oh, I understand.

604
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,056
I was your age
when I started my first novel...

605
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:10,655
...and three years later when I finished it,
I was a very different man.

606
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,325
What do you mean, your first novel?

607
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:15,563
I wrote two unpublished novels
when I was in my 20s.

608
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,204
I would love to read them.

609
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,207
I'm afraid that's impossible.

610
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:22,743
Why? You destroyed them?

611
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,542
I had to, in order to keep writing.
And if I hadn't...

612
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,844
...I might not have written Tenderness.

613
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,412
And...

614
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:35,218
...we wouldn't be here right now.

615
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,694
And where are we, Leonard?

616
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,492
Well, it's getting late.

617
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:47,535
I think maybe we should
pick this up next time.

618
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,038
Okay.

619
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:06,942
Where are you?

620
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,855
I'm leaving, Dad.

621
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,480
Soup's on the stove.
Let it simmer for an hour.

622
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,723
Thank you, dear.
See you tonight. Love you.

623
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:19,954
Love you too.

624
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,068
Hi, Miss Wolfe.
Why don't you head on up.

625
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,204
Thanks, Jeff.

626
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,473
- Hey, Ariel.
- Hey, Heather.

627
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,702
I don't think Dad's expecting you.
He's working now.

628
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,540
I know. We have a lot of ground
to cover. I gotta crack that whip.

629
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,342
He's very strict about his writing hours.

630
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:42,815
Well, maybe a little shake-up in the
routine is just what Leonard needs.

631
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,884
Hey, by the way, happy birthday.

632
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:49,218
Oh, thank you.
How did you know it's my birthday?

633
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,259
Of course I know it's your birthday.

634
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,398
Hi, Leonard.
I know it's not a work day...

635
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:01,225
...but last night I came across
something that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote.

636
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,429
It really got me thinking.

637
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,700
Can't it wait ‘til Monday?
I really must get back to work.

638
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:09,903
He said that most good writers line
themselves up along a solid gold bar.

639
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,708
Heather, these are my writing hours.
You must respect them.

640
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,819
I'm sorry. I guess it will have to wait.

641
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,589
Now that you're here...

642
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:30,928
...if you have work to do,
you're welcome to the living room.

643
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,704
Well...

644
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:23,108
...since you're here, I suppose
we should get our work in now.

645
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,984
What's all this about
F. Scott Fitzgerald's solid gold bar?

646
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,524
Okay. He says that most great writers...

647
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,254
...have an essential theme
that runs through their best work...

648
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,797
...like Hemingway's courage,
or Dostoyevsky's spiritual violence.

649
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,425
I trust you've resisted any impulse
to place me in their company.

650
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:44,061
Well, I do say that you
breathe the same moral air...

651
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,141
...especially in your first two novels...

652
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,744
...when you adhere closely
to your solid gold bar.

653
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,473
Ah, yes, personal liberation
in the works of Leonard Schiller.

654
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:56,813
Don't misunderstand me.
The last two novels are brilliant.

655
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:01,151
But I sense a stylistic change...

656
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,818
...where you're writing less nakedly...

657
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,485
...less personally.

658
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,259
Well, I did...

659
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:14,636
...attempt to work on a larger
social canvas in The Lost City.

660
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,899
But in my estimation
it's my most passionate novel.

661
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,440
It's true, my work
did change after Stella died.

662
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,106
But I suppose, my life,
as a source of inspiration...

663
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,183
...began to interest me less.

664
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:32,654
You must have loved her deeply.

665
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,219
My wife was not a bounded entity.

666
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,921
She made me feel that I existed in her...

667
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,556
...as much as I existed in my own body.

668
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,595
You never experienced that again...

669
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,762
...after you lost her?

670
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,307
No.

671
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,711
No, I suppose not.

672
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,079
But then I wouldn't be a writer,
would I, if I weren't...

673
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,923
...blinded by optimism.

674
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,093
I always loved this photograph of you.

675
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,858
Oh, thank you.

676
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,828
Thank you so much.
Dinner will be ready in a sec, okay?

677
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,976
So, Ariel tells me you are
about to launch your own magazine.

678
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,172
Yeah, yeah. I've always
wanted to provide a forum...

679
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:35,648
...where people on the left could argue.

680
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:38,515
It just remains to be seen
if anyone's up for a good fight.

681
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,954
I was involved with a magazine
for a while back in the 60s.

682
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,993
A literary journal to be published
and edited by eight young writers.

683
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,324
No kidding. Anything become of it?

684
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,798
No. There's something
about collaboration...

685
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,062
...that brings out the worst in writers.

686
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:56,936
Well, there's only four of us...

687
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,804
...so I guess we'll have fewer
opportunities to disagree.

688
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,708
It takes a capacity
for compromise, doesn't it?

689
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:07,542
As in any worthwhile endeavor,
be it a magazine...

690
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:11,620
...or a literary journal, or a family.

691
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,852
One has to be willing to...

692
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,483
...surrender occasionally...

693
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,619
...one's beliefs for the greater good.

694
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,563
Ariel tells me you've got
a young biographer...

695
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,368
...doing a study of your work.
How's that going?

696
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,806
Oh, marvelous.

697
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,642
Suddenly the literary world is abuzz...

698
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,145
...with curiosity about my every move.

699
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,910
Well, you deserve it, Leonard.

700
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,918
I mean, if anyone knows
the meaning of the word compromise.

701
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,785
Ariel has often told me...

702
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,861
...how you locked yourself away
in your writing room...

703
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,863
...cutting yourself off
from the rest of the world.

704
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:59,127
I'm really glad you're finally
going to get your due.

705
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:02,738
Case, can you give me a hand?

706
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,464
Yeah, yeah. Coming, baby.

707
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,135
Excuse me, Leonard.

708
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,302
Duty calls.

709
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,416
I'm done with the first part
about his first two books.

710
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,282
And that came easily
because I love them...

711
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,186
...but I'm having the hardest time
writing about the last two.

712
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,492
I just don't get them.

713
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,394
You don't get them
or you don't like them?

714
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:35,235
I guess I took it for granted
that I would grow to like them.

715
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,904
But...

716
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:42,068
But they never catch fire.
They're too neutral. They're too careful.

717
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,578
The books I love, they valued
a certain kind of recklessness.

718
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:50,042
At first I was in awe of that
single-minded devotion to his art...

719
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,383
...and now I suspect
it's drained the life out of his work.

720
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:56,083
Two great novels is nothing to sneeze at.

721
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,826
My thesis was going to be about...

722
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,056
...one of America's great
unacknowledged writers...

723
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:05,395
...not one that was written-out
by the time he was 45 years old.

724
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,936
To be a writer, sometimes
you have to hurt people's feelings.

725
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,336
Sometimes you have to be a bastard.

726
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,871
You'll be speaking with conviction.
When you speak with conviction...

727
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,536
...people notice.

728
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,087
But he's had enough disappointment.

729
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,156
I mean, I don't even think
he's gotten over losing his wife.

730
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,089
I hate to tell tales out of school, but...

731
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,991
...from what I hear, it's a little
more complicated than that.

732
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,425
What do you mean?

733
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,500
Well, when I was heading down
to the Vanity Fair party with Frederick...

734
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,160
...he told me a few things
about your friend Leonard.

735
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,705
It's good.

736
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,052
Did you see the newspaper
this morning, darling?

737
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,244
No, I didn't get a chance.

738
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,880
Well, there's a story here...

739
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:08,154
...of a comet that will be visible
probably within the next few months.

740
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,324
Russell's Comet. It comes
close to the earth every 45 years.

741
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,197
I saw it with your mother.

742
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:18,873
And I think you should see it and
then you can tell your children about it.

743
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,272
And when it comes around
in another 45 years...

744
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,106
...they can see it for themselves.

745
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,849
My children. That's nice.
Maybe I will just have a couple.

746
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:31,476
If you'll allow me,
I'd like to make a toast...

747
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,612
...to Ariel, our birthday girl.

748
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,088
Ariel, back when we first met...

749
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:39,422
...and we shared those
years of our lives together...

750
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:44,192
...I always felt like I was
the luckiest guy in New York City.

751
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,029
And now, five years later...

752
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,138
...for us to find each other again...

753
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,463
Well, I know I am.

754
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:55,976
The way you encourage me
to go after my dreams...

755
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,376
...and take chances with my life...

756
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,483
...even if those chances
run contrary to your dreams...

757
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,712
...is a quality that...

758
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,319
Well, you know, it comes around
as often as Russell's Comet.

759
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,923
So...

760
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,051
So I raise my glass to you...

761
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,190
...on your 40th birthday...

762
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:19,193
...in the hope that
I give you some measure...

763
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,532
...of what I know you give me.

764
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,406
You do.

765
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:32,605
Good evening, Jeff.

766
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,740
Hi, Professor.
Miss Wolfe is here to see you.

767
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,114
I told her you were out,
but she wanted to wait.

768
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:44,753
Thank you, Jeff.

769
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:53,091
- Leonard, I want to read your book.
- What's this all about?

770
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,761
I know you have a rule
against letting anyone see your work...

771
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,169
...before it's completed,
but I want you to break it.

772
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,774
- That's out of the question.
- Why?

773
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,343
Because I am not ready to show it.

774
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,441
But that's precisely why
you should let me read it.

775
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,515
Take a chance.
Maybe it'll free you to finish it.

776
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,450
I'll finish it by sitting in front of
my typewriter first thing in the morning.

777
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,817
So if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to get to bed.

778
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,524
I thought you would make
an exception for me.

779
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:19,526
You'll have to make do
with my published novels.

780
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,924
Good night, Heather.

781
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,092
I'm sorry, it's not good enough, Leonard.

782
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,511
What are you not getting,
Heather? What's the problem?

783
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,214
We had an understanding, Leonard...

784
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,023
...that if I was to do justice
to your work...

785
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,355
...you would share with me
the events that shaped it.

786
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,293
That's precisely what I've done.

787
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:59,162
Talk with you openly
about my life and my work.

788
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,133
With one glaring omission.

789
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,798
What in God's name
are you talking about?

790
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,374
Your marriage.

791
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,643
So you've done some
investigative work...

792
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,649
...and uncovered details
about my personal life.

793
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,412
You've been dishonest with me...

794
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,851
...and it makes me wonder
if you're honest with yourself.

795
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,389
I told you from day one
I would not indulge in gossip.

796
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,392
Oh, but you had no problem
feeding me a myth...

797
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,462
...about a marriage
that was some work of art.

798
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:31,192
It was a work of art. And like
many works of art, it was imperfect.

799
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,131
Your wife left you for another man.

800
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:36,329
One year before my wife died...

801
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,270
...we went through
some troubled times. Yes.

802
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,569
What does that tell you about my work?

803
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,077
That life betrayed you
and you went into hiding...

804
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,706
...and you took your characters with you.
So they began guarding their lives.

805
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,341
They stopped giving in to temptation.

806
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,647
No, Miss Wolfe.

807
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:56,621
They learned the cost
of living only for themselves.

808
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:00,217
And I became aware of problems
far greater than my own.

809
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:04,163
And you insult my writing
by trying to define it...

810
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:07,700
...by a single unhappy event from my
past. If I had known you were...

811
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:12,035
...going to subject my work to such
simplistic psychological criticism...

812
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:15,041
...I never would've wasted my time
with you in the first place!

813
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,442
You don't have to insult me, Leonard.

814
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,412
You insult me.

815
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,550
You insult me...

816
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,580
...by insinuating that I should
write the same book...

817
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,350
...over and over again.

818
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,681
I'm sorry I kept you up.

819
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,758
I should really get going.

820
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,797
Heather.

821
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:13,365
If you'd like to...

822
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,370
...stay here and not drive all the way
back to Hoboken at this late hour...

823
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:19,667
...I understand.

824
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,306
You're welcome to the guest room.

825
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:53,632
Come in.

826
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,781
Would you like me to wake you
at any particular time?

827
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:03,952
No.

828
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,279
I'm always up by 7:00.

829
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:09,758
Well...

830
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,789
...I'll say good night, then.

831
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:29,729
<i>Hi. Please leave a message
here for Heather Wolfe.</i>

832
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:34,239
<i>Hi, Heather. This is Leonard.</i>

833
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,504
<i>I just wanted to wish you well
as you finish your thesis.</i>

834
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,582
<i>There's no need to call back.
I'll see you next Friday as planned. Bye.</i>

835
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:55,724
I'm sorry I'm late. The car died.
I had to take the train.

836
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,856
Oh, that's perfectly alright. Is this it?

837
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,462
- Yes.
- My.

838
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,401
It's only a first draft
and I hope you bear that in mind.

839
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:04,870
Don't say a word.

840
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:17,277
- How are we doing tonight?
- Oh, we're doing just fine tonight.

841
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,419
A drink to start?

842
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,215
- Yes...
- Yeah, what do you have on tap?

843
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:23,951
Amstel, Bud, Bass, Harp,
Dos Equis, Rolling Rock...

844
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,923
I'll have a Dos Equis.

845
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,628
Good choice. For you, Sir?

846
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,698
I'll have a glass of the house white.

847
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,429
I won't be a minute.

848
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,811
There's something I'd like to give you.

849
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:55,513
This is the key to my apartment.

850
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,525
I thought since you spend
so much time in the city...

851
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,789
...if there are some nights
you don't want to go...

852
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,729
...all the way back to Hoboken,
you could stay in the guest room.

853
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,394
Or if you need somewhere
to read in the afternoons.

854
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,137
I just want you to know...

855
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,766
...that there is a place
that you can come...

856
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:18,880
...without having to explain yourself.

857
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:21,950
Thank you.

858
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,509
This is an honor.

859
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:32,694
Well...

860
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,564
...here's to the completion
of many months of hard work.

861
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,568
Oh, I should remind you it's just a draft
and I plan on doing a lot more work on it.

862
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,228
Don't worry so much.

863
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,774
If you really want to continue
with literary criticism...

864
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,114
...I could lend you some books
by the great critics of my era.

865
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,585
I'd appreciate that.

866
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,917
I doubt that they're taught
in academies anymore...

867
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:04,992
...but that's really all to their credit,
because they weren't theorists.

868
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,389
They were readers.

869
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,053
I would like to continue with criticism.

870
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,258
It'd be a good excuse to read
the books I love over and over again.

871
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,070
Heather, I'd like to sit down
for just one minute.

872
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,668
Are you alright?

873
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:24,876
How can I help you?

874
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,218
It's alright. It's just
a little bit of heartburn.

875
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:35,421
There, it's passed. So let's continue.

876
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,557
Let me get a cab.

877
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,159
No, I'm fine. I'm really fine.

878
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,762
I'd love to walk.
It's such a lovely evening.

879
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:42,897
Okay.

880
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:49,771
It is.

881
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:01,639
Now, let's see.

882
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,415
Ah, yes, Trilling...

883
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,857
...Howe...

884
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,255
...and, oh...

885
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:15,125
...especially Edmund Wilson.

886
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,597
Take your time with them.

887
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,403
That's very generous of you.

888
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,275
Thank you for a lovely evening.

889
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,906
Oh, I enjoyed myself too.

890
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,958
- Hey, Happer.
- Hey, Flapper.

891
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,156
What are you reading?

892
01:13:57,299 --> 01:14:01,633
It's your dad's last novel,
The Lost City. I really like this book.

893
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,829
It's stronger than his first one.

894
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,701
That was so soft and sentimental.

895
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,706
Soft and sentimental? My father?

896
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,641
Yeah, yeah. You know, it was
one of those relationship books.

897
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,976
Two couples and all of their
problems and all of that.

898
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:17,643
This one's great.
It's about something. It's got guts.

899
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,117
What do you got there?

900
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,585
I have a course guide...

901
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:24,317
...in a master's program
in Expressive Arts Therapy.

902
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,327
What? Expressive...

903
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,760
What is Expressive Arts Therapy?

904
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:32,128
It uses movement and dance
to work through your issues.

905
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:35,100
And who exactly would benefit
from that kind of treatment?

906
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,932
Oh, I don't know, I mean,
someone who might have difficulty...

907
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,564
...tapping into his
soft and sentimental side.

908
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,911
<i>I can't say your study
filled me with elation...</i>

909
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,315
<i>...but I appreciate your honesty...</i>

910
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:28,446
<i>...your kind remarks
about the first two books...</i>

911
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,651
<i>...and especially the seriousness with
which you've thought about my work.</i>

912
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,865
<i>I'm grateful that you looked for
a common thread in my work...</i>

913
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:40,196
<i>...although I do wonder whether
it was precisely your conclusion...</i>

914
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,803
<i>...that my true theme is "freedom"...</i>

915
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,203
<i>...that left you unable to appreciate
my two later books...</i>

916
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,935
<i>...especially The Lost City.</i>

917
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:52,012
<i>But I suppose it's not for me to say.</i>

918
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:56,272
<i>A writer isn't the best judge
of his own work.</i>

919
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,283
<i>I once knew a literary critic who...</i>

920
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,547
<i>...when asked to characterize
his critical method...</i>

921
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:04,819
<i>...said that he simply tried
to read the hell out of a book.</i>

922
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:09,223
"You've certainly read the hell out of
mine, and that's all a writer can ask.

923
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,959
Yours, Leonard."
And "P.S. Your prose is good...

924
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,035
...but here and there
it could be more direct.

925
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,695
I made a few suggestions
on the manuscript."

926
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,364
And then he went ahead
and gave me a complete line-edit.

927
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:24,036
He strengthened all of my arguments,
and the amazing thing is...

928
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,977
...he made it much more
clearly critical of his own work.

929
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:31,314
That's great. You must be thrilled.

930
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,580
I should be, shouldn't I?

931
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,128
How's the writing going?

932
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:45,530
It's not too bad, I suppose.

933
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:51,104
I haven't seen your friend Heather
around in a while. Where's she been?

934
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:54,208
Couldn't say. Her work is done.

935
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,777
Did she finish that book,
or whatever it was?

936
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:01,047
Master's thesis. It wasn't very good.
Kind of half-baked, really.

937
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,545
Well, I'm not surprised.

938
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:09,156
Hey, Dad, The Young Girls of Rochefort
is playing at Cinema Village tonight.

939
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,624
- Do you want to join me and Casey?
- I don't think so. Not tonight.

940
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:13,761
It's a new print.

941
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:15,419
No. I really don't feel up to it.

942
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:18,498
Oh, come on! You love that movie.

943
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:22,435
What do you mean,
you're not surprised?

944
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:24,903
Excuse me?

945
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,940
Why are you not surprised?

946
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,911
She graduated from an Ivy League
school. Do you have any idea...

947
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:34,447
...how much hard work
and how much discipline that takes?

948
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,949
What basis do you have
for denigrating her work?

949
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,921
Hey, you're the one that said
it was half-baked!

950
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,524
She's been published
in a major literary journal.

951
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,853
Okay, I didn't mean anything by it.

952
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:50,090
She just didn't impress me as being
deep enough to write about your work.

953
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,199
I thought she'd be
wasting your valuable time.

954
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,633
Wasting valuable time. There's
a subject you're well-schooled in.

955
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,465
Oh, well, what's that
supposed to mean, huh?

956
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,640
Are you talking about Casey, Dad?

957
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,543
Because you don't know
what goes on between Casey and me!

958
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,477
You don't know the first thing
about our relationship!

959
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,482
I know enough. I was there
for his birthday toast to you.

960
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:10,949
Apparently, I'm the
only one who heard it.

961
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,020
I heard it. He said that
he's lucky to find me again.

962
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:18,786
He said that you give him everything
and you ask for so little in return.

963
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,418
Of course he feels lucky.
How can you accept such a condition?

964
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:25,226
A man who says
you're secondary to his dreams...

965
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,562
...and you always will be.

966
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:31,632
I don't know, Dad.
How did Mom do it?

967
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,456
Oh, come on, Casey. You look like
you're going to the dentist.

968
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:51,582
Keep an open mind.
You might even enjoy it.

969
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:55,527
Yeah, two hours of French people singing
and dancing for no apparent reason.

970
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:57,655
I think the world
would be a better place...

971
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:00,529
...if everybody sang and danced
for no apparent reason.

972
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:03,661
Just remember your part of the deal,
alright? This week we see the...

973
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:04,805
This.

974
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,101
Next week, The Battle of Algiers.

975
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,347
You know, Case,
go see The Battle of Algiers.

976
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:14,608
No, no. A deal's a deal.

977
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,743
No. Go ahead.
Go see the movie you want.

978
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,947
- Really? You don't mind?
- No. What's the difference?

979
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,752
I mean, we're both
sitting in the dark anyway, right?

980
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:27,088
Yeah. Okay.

981
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,493
Well... Yeah, you see
the movie you want to see...

982
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:33,397
...I'll see what I want to see,
and we can discuss them over dinner.

983
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:37,537
One for Algiers and one
for Rochefort please.

984
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:40,773
And how are you today, Ms. Wolfe?

985
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,776
I'm alright, Jeff. Thanks.
Is the professor home?

986
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:46,380
He took a walk this morning,
but he's been back for hours.

987
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,973
That's weird. I just called him a few
minutes ago and there was no answer.

988
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,585
Maybe he's taking a nap.

989
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,588
No. He never naps in the late afternoon
because it keeps him up at night.

990
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:58,422
He's not picking up.

991
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,380
Leonard?

992
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:27,221
Oh, Leonard. Are you okay?

993
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,516
Let me help you up, Professor.

994
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,242
How is he?

995
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,376
I don't know.

996
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,069
Well, what did they say?
What happened?

997
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:55,775
They said they can't be sure,
but that they think it might be a stroke.

998
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:58,344
I'll be right back, Case.

999
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,726
Hi. I'm Heather Wolfe,
a friend of Leonard's.

1000
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,193
Casey Davis.
I've heard a lot about you.

1001
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:09,854
You're writing that book about him.

1002
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,592
Oh, it's only a thesis.

1003
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:20,805
I've just been reading
The Lost City. It's brilliant.

1004
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:23,137
Yes, it is.

1005
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,269
Okay, the doctor's going to be out soon.

1006
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,348
It might not be a stroke.
It might be stress.

1007
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:31,145
He has been under a lot of stress lately.

1008
01:21:31,286 --> 01:21:34,255
Yeah, he's had a hard time
finishing his book.

1009
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,363
If I fall apart, will you take care of me?

1010
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,557
I will if you do, but you won't.

1011
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:46,700
Alright?

1012
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:48,496
I can accept he's going to die.

1013
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:51,765
I just can't accept
he's going to be dead forever.

1014
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:55,233
He's going to be alright.

1015
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,310
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes.

1016
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:57,775
I'm Ariel Schiller. This is Casey.

1017
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:01,178
Nice to meet you. First, let me tell you
that your father is resting comfortably.

1018
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,911
His vital signs are stable, but it appears
that he suffered a fairly large stroke.

1019
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:08,454
He hasn't caused any further damage
to his heart, which is encouraging...

1020
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,921
...but he's still not responsive.

1021
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:12,925
It'll be 24 hours or so before
we really know where we are.

1022
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,358
- Can I see him?
- Yes, of course.

1023
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:17,260
He may not know you're there,
but you can talk to him just the same.

1024
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,457
- I want to see him.
- Okay.

1025
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,899
He's in ICU right now. They're
finishing up. I can take you over there.

1026
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,834
Is this what you mean
by shaking things up?

1027
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,272
Is this what you had in mind?

1028
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,491
What?

1029
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,252
Diaphragm.

1030
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,393
I can't do it, Casey.

1031
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:31,061
Can't do what?

1032
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,695
I can't do hot and light.

1033
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:36,063
Hey, I never called it
hot and light. That's your term.

1034
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,934
Oh, yeah? What do you call it?

1035
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,201
Love. That's what I call it.

1036
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,537
Right. With one condition.

1037
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,942
And I can't live with it. I never could.

1038
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,881
I thought that was behind us.

1039
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,685
Yeah, you know, what can I say, Case?

1040
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,345
I have a bad habit
of silencing myself with you.

1041
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:57,089
I barely survived it the last time.

1042
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:00,227
It doesn't say much for me if I get
in line for more of the same, does it?

1043
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:01,361
Ariel.

1044
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:05,364
Why go back there, huh?

1045
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,297
I mean, we talked it all through.

1046
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,426
No, we didn't talk it through.

1047
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:11,299
You defended yourself and I got over it.

1048
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:14,403
You asked me to leave,
remember? I wanted to stay.

1049
01:25:14,576 --> 01:25:17,568
Oh, lose the child, and then
go on as if nothing happened?

1050
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,442
Come on. How long
would that have lasted?

1051
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,948
Let's be honest, Casey.

1052
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,779
It may not be my fate to have children.

1053
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,889
I can live with that.

1054
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,984
But I just can't live without possibility.

1055
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,994
And you're a closed man, Casey.

1056
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:38,289
There's just not enough
air in your world.

1057
01:25:50,945 --> 01:25:52,936
Can we sleep on it?

1058
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:58,746
What is there to sleep on?

1059
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,952
Ariel, I'm not leaving you alone.
Not tonight.

1060
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,683
Not with Leonard in the state he's in.

1061
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,623
That's exactly why you have to leave.

1062
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,486
If anything happens to my father...

1063
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:11,997
...I'll never be this strong again.

1064
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,748
Hey. I'll set you up in the kitchen.

1065
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,222
I'll just get a cup of tea, and we'll just...

1066
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,106
Can I get you a cup of tea?

1067
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,683
No, I don't... No, thank you.

1068
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:58,297
- Hey, Dad, do you want me to get it?
- I'll get it.

1069
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:06,535
Dad, I'm going to leave
your walker by the door.

1070
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,876
A walker.

1071
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,985
My goodness.

1072
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:38,578
Shouldn't you be resting?

1073
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,874
Are you sure you should
be working so soon?

1074
01:28:44,252 --> 01:28:47,119
I'm running out of time, dear.

1075
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:50,355
I have to finish.

1076
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:20,977
My daughter.

1077
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,047
Hi, Heather.

1078
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,583
I'm glad you could stop by.

1079
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,311
Oh, I meant to come by sooner.

1080
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,649
Your visits have always
meant a lot to him.

1081
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,724
Thank you. How's he feeling?

1082
01:29:57,859 --> 01:30:00,327
He gets tired after about a half hour...

1083
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:03,794
...but he's a lot better
than he was a month ago.

1084
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,195
Let me put these in a vase.

1085
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,324
Heather.

1086
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:36,295
Daddy, see the nice flowers
Heather got for you.

1087
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,058
Lovely.

1088
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,569
Your snack's ready.
I'll be back in about an hour, okay?

1089
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:47,503
Love you.

1090
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,405
Bye, Heather.

1091
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:15,334
How are you?

1092
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,907
Hanging on.

1093
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:24,737
Ariel tells me you're writing again.

1094
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,178
I sit.

1095
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:33,084
I look for the typewriter keys.

1096
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:35,985
Sometimes I find them.

1097
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:42,661
Well, I'm glad you're working again.

1098
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:46,494
I'm glad you're going to finish your book.

1099
01:31:53,374 --> 01:31:56,104
I was reading about how
Rosellen Brown...

1100
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:58,109
...she got all her old books
back in print...

1101
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:01,272
...after she hit it big
with Before And After.

1102
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,282
I really think that could happen for you.

1103
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:16,263
I think it's really wonderful
that you're going on.

1104
01:32:17,665 --> 01:32:21,157
And I have a good feeling
about this new book.

1105
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:24,371
I think it's going to be your best.

1106
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:13,577
I didn't deserve that.

1107
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,635
I'm sorry everything got so fucked up.

1108
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:34,402
You gave an old man some excitement.

1109
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:40,305
It's been good knowing you.

1110
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:50,118
I got the best of the bargain.

1111
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:40,394
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I got lost.

1112
01:35:40,534 --> 01:35:42,934
Is this the right room for
Advanced Booty Ballet?

1113
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:48,665
No, Advanced Booty Ballet is
across the hall. This is Pilates.

1114
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:51,676
See, I got to do something
about this big old caboose of mine.

1115
01:35:53,614 --> 01:35:56,048
Okay, in that case,
how about a cup of coffee?

1116
01:35:56,617 --> 01:35:59,609
No, I can't.
I have class in 15 minutes.

1117
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,449
Well, what about after class?

1118
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:03,886
I can't. I have school tonight.

1119
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:05,024
School? Oh, wow.

1120
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:08,890
You got into that
Expressive Arts Therapy program?

1121
01:36:09,029 --> 01:36:10,656
Well, there's a cause for celebration.

1122
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,266
That's it. I'll take you out
to dinner straight after school.

1123
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:18,134
No, it's not a good idea, Case.

1124
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,437
I'd have to disagree with you, Schiller.

1125
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:24,373
Look, I've been doing a lot of thinking
and I'm seeing things more clearly.

1126
01:36:25,713 --> 01:36:29,615
People don't change.
Not that fast, Casey.

1127
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:35,049
Look, I know my reputation
precedes me, but...

1128
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:39,285
I'm ready, Ariel. I'm ready
to make some big changes.

1129
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:43,988
It's not going to hold.

1130
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,998
You just miss the comfort of us
being together. That's not change.

1131
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:48,260
That's fear of change.

1132
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:50,461
Come on, Ariel. Come on.

1133
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:52,936
You're selling me short here.

1134
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,078
Case, we're not a good match.

1135
01:37:03,017 --> 01:37:05,815
It kills me to let you go.

1136
01:37:05,953 --> 01:37:09,354
But I am. I'm letting you go.

1137
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:13,017
Oh, Ariel, there you are.

1138
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:16,288
Please tell me you're free
to cover my 3:00 tomorrow.

1139
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:17,761
Yeah, yeah, I can cover it.

1140
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:19,889
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
I cracked a crown.

1141
01:37:20,034 --> 01:37:22,298
It's the only time my dentist
could fit me in this week.

1142
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:23,698
No, no. I can't.

1143
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:26,830
I've got to take my father
to the doctor tomorrow. I can't.

1144
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:28,839
Did you ask Brenda?

1145
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:31,638
Yeah, she has a private.
And Ruthie's out of town.

1146
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:33,440
I'll do it.

1147
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:35,108
You can't teach yoga.

1148
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,946
No, I mean, I'll take your dad
to his doctor's appointment.

1149
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,112
Really?

1150
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:43,155
Yeah, why not?

1151
01:37:44,325 --> 01:37:46,122
Okay. I guess you're covered.

1152
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:50,458
Thank you, kind stranger.
You've earned many karma points.

1153
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:55,328
Case, this doesn't change anything.

1154
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:58,735
Yeah, I'm just helping out.

1155
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,534
Nothing more than that.

1156
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,378
Thank you.

1157
01:38:18,759 --> 01:38:21,751
So how did it go?

1158
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,625
Don't grow old.

1159
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:26,028
That's my advice.

1160
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:32,136
Oh, dear.

1161
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,773
Is something wrong?

1162
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,741
My stomach.

1163
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:47,981
My body is not my own.
It's time to die.

1164
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:55,794
It's not time to die, Leonard.
It's just time to get you to a restroom.

1165
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,955
Give me your hand.

1166
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:00,333
Come on.

1167
01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:02,335
I'm sorry to have to
put you through this.

1168
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:03,469
Don't mention it.

1169
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:06,539
Thank you.
I don't want to make a scene.

1170
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:09,006
Don't worry about it, alright?

1171
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,878
- Can I help you?
- We're fine.

1172
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,421
Restroom's for customers only.

1173
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:25,957
Alright. We're customers.

1174
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:35,767
Stand up on three. Okay, Leonard.

1175
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:39,236
One, two, three.

1176
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:42,170
That's it.

1177
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:47,175
Alright. Stepping out.

1178
01:40:10,938 --> 01:40:12,769
Thank you.

1179
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:19,436
That seems to be all
I'm able to say to you today.

1180
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:22,278
Let that "thank you"
stand for all the others.

1181
01:40:23,617 --> 01:40:25,482
Alright.

1182
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:30,286
I wonder if I might be so bold
as to ask another favor of you.

1183
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:31,482
What can I do for you?

1184
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:34,093
Perhaps you might
be able to find a place...

1185
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:36,662
...to store this for me.

1186
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,023
What is it?

1187
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,567
Something I've been working on.

1188
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,169
Leonard...

1189
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:51,835
...this is your novel. You've been
working on this for ten years.

1190
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:54,573
Yes, precisely. And I've only recently...

1191
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:58,207
...come to realize
why it's eluded me for so long.

1192
01:40:58,352 --> 01:40:59,352
Why is that?

1193
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:04,514
My characters haven't
done anything interesting.

1194
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:07,789
I followed them faithfully
for over a decade...

1195
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:12,262
...but I finally have to
admit they never will.

1196
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:20,003
Well, why not put it in your closet
and spend some time away from them?

1197
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:22,438
You may be inspired
to figure out what to do.

1198
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:25,371
I already know what to do.

1199
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:29,613
But that would mean starting over...

1200
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:33,345
...and I'm not so sure I have the strength.

1201
01:41:33,487 --> 01:41:37,150
I understand, but all the same...

1202
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:41,022
...I can't imagine Leonard Schiller
not working on a novel.

1203
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:44,964
So, what are you
going to do now, my friend?

1204
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:50,033
Right now I'm going
to go home and sleep...

1205
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:53,196
...for maybe a hundred years.

1206
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:55,870
Thank you, Casey.

1207
01:42:21,735 --> 01:42:24,101
You're glowing at me again.

1208
01:42:30,878 --> 01:42:32,277
What?

1209
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:34,411
I just talked to my Dad.

1210
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:36,448
And?

1211
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:38,915
Let's just say you have a fan
in Leonard Schiller.

1212
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:40,651
Yeah? What did he say?

1213
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:43,688
He said you held his hand in hell.

1214
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:47,419
No, not hell. It wasn't hell.

1215
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,029
It was Hell's Kitchen, maybe.

1216
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:54,993
Wait a second.
How'd you get in here?

1217
01:42:55,169 --> 01:42:58,605
Just because I let you go,
it doesn't mean I had to turn my key in.

1218
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,099
Well, I had to turn in mine.
That hardly seems fair.

1219
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,675
What's fair got to do with it?

1220
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:32,475
STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING
