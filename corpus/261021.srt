1
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,592
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,224
Yeah. Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick

3
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,133
Nickelodeon.

4
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,013
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,317
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

6
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,789
Give it, give it

7
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,519
Yeah, yeah

8
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,610
Whoo, yeah, yeah

9
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,383
It's Harriet the spy

10
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,889
Spies look at the eye

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,983
Now there she go
like looking at

12
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,519
Say why, hi, my, my, my,
my, my, my, my

13
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,533
Dig it, dig it, yeah

14
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,229
There she,
there she go, go, go

15
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,274
There she go now

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,868
Look at the spy

17
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,402
Hey, watch her, watch her,
watch her

18
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,709
She's a spy, my, my

19
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,806
Dig it, dig it

20
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,874
Oh, yeah

21
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,382
She's lookin'
in your eye, eye

22
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,321
Why? I don't know

23
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,084
Whoa, yeah.

24
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,640
Boy with ringlets.

25
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,371
Man with tattoos.

26
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,252
Girl on...

27
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,948
a leash?

28
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,923
Man, if my parents ever tried

29
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,984
putting me in one
of those things,

30
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,756
I'd trade them in.

31
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,492
This kid looks like
she can roll over and fetch.

32
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,691
I learn everything I can

33
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,896
and I write down
everything I see.

34
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,167
Golly says if I want
to be a writer

35
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,935
then I'd better start now.

36
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,442
Which is why I am a spy.

37
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,112
Lady with a purse.

38
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,124
Man with...

39
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,752
her wallet.

40
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,386
Oh, help!

41
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,158
Please!

42
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,422
Stop him!

43
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,867
Stop him!

44
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,080
Quack

45
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,143
Quack, quack

46
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,653
Quack

47
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,316
Quack, quack

48
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,723
And... done.

49
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,497
What is it?

50
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:00,499
It's Nanomichi.

51
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,626
You know, the god
of storm and thunder.

52
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,603
- Cool, huh?
- Okay, come on, hurry up

53
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,604
before it dries.

54
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,605
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,129
Okay, ready?

56
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,436
Here, give me
your foot.

57
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,942
The secret tattoo.

58
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,877
My best friends Sport,
Janie and I thought

59
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,778
we should be blood buddies.

60
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,181
But this was so much
less painful.

61
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,684
Just remember the rule.

62
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,714
If anyone sees
the secret tattoo...

63
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,192
...swift and painful death.

64
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,035
It's... starting.

65
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,576
Here comes...

66
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:49,980
nice Marion Hawthorne.

67
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,311
It's happening.

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,444
I can feel it happening.

69
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,885
Good Lord.

70
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,946
It's the dreaded
Hawthorne effect.

71
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,389
Oh.

72
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,922
Good morning, Janie, Simon...

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,900
and Harriet.

74
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,329
Harri... et!

75
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,240
I got to get to class.

76
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,072
See ya.

77
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,170
See you guys in a few.

78
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,977
Sixth grade.

79
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:31,924
All the usual suspects
are back in action.

80
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,758
First of all there's
Rachel Hennessy,

81
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,956
Marion's second in command.

82
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,431
The only thing more pathetic
than being Marion Hawthorne

83
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,959
is wanting to be
Marion Hawthorne.

84
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,069
Pinky Whitehead,

85
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,099
the human fish belly.

86
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,510
If Janie's theory is right,
then Pinky's DNA

87
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,379
was combined with a pint
of vanilla yogurt at birth.

88
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,010
Carrie Andrews thinks
she's cool...

89
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,087
'cause she spent her summer
vacation growing boobs.

90
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,784
Laura Peters looks like
someone pinched her face

91
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,160
and it stuck that way.

92
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,631
The boy with purple socks.

93
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,759
A man of mystery.

94
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,736
He never talks.

95
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,933
If I were known
only by my footwear,

96
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,907
I'd hang myself.

97
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,673
Beth Ellen Hansen always looks
like she's about to cry.

98
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,078
I wish someone
would just kick her

99
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,605
and get it over with.

100
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,083
And then of course,
there's our teacher...

101
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,554
Miss Elson.

102
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,853
She's nice, and polite.

103
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,587
I bet one day she goes
on a psycho killing spree,

104
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,390
and all her neighbors
will say...

105
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,420
"She was nice and polite."

106
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,299
Well, from what your last
two teachers tell me,

107
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,202
it looks like
déja vu all over again.

108
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,377
It's time to vote for
a sixth grade class president.

109
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,316
And for the third year
in a row...

110
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,445
we're down to our final
two nominees,

111
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,185
and they are Harriet Welsch

112
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,285
and Marion Hawthorne.

113
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,059
And so, as you may know,

114
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,033
the duties of the class
president include

115
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:26,402
taking attendance,
reporting bad behavior

116
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:32,708
and best of all, editing
the sixth grade newspaper.

117
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,245
And now we vote.

118
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,178
Marion Hawthorne... again.

119
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,054
Three years in a row.

120
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,458
You know what?
I think I'll invent a poison.

121
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,483
A really good,

122
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,656
clean, untraceable poison.

123
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,164
One that fries your brains

124
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,667
and makes all your bodily
fluids boil at once.

125
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,963
- Could you?
- Check it out.

126
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,401
One day I'd be like,
"Oh, hi, Marion.

127
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,429
"Oh, no, I'm not
finishing this soda."

128
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,634
And she'd be like...

129
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,115
I'm serious.

130
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,777
Any of you guys
want to come over?

131
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,876
I got to get home.

132
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,751
If my amoebas start
incubating,

133
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,619
they really stink up the house.

134
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,783
Harriet?

135
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,792
Sorry. Spy time.

136
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,322
Spy route.

137
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,191
Harrison Withers' place.

138
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:59,389
Higher altitude, lower risk.

139
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,830
But always a show.

140
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,163
Yeah, everybody's gonna have
some grease today...

141
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:14,509
All right, now, Jelly Roll.
Yeah.

142
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:17,071
Lady Day

143
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:20,573
Come what may,
whatever you say

144
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:22,483
We all gonna have
a good time

145
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,681
A little bit
for you, Satchmo

146
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:26,213
You, Bessie

147
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,657
And how 'bout you,
Jelly Roll?

148
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,924
Golly says, people
who love work love life.

149
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,123
Dizzy, Dizzy

150
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:34,995
I like Harrison Withers,

151
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,728
'cause he's a guy
that loves both.

152
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,828
Scooby dah...

153
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:41,702
Scooby-dooby, du-day

154
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,970
Okay, that's it.

155
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,013
Curiously, Harrison lives

156
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,640
for his cats.

157
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:53,913
Wow! Birdland.

158
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:58,879
But his work is for the birds.

159
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:04,154
Charlie Parker.

160
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,755
Yardbird.

161
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:10,700
In any case, his cages
are the most beautiful

162
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,066
I've ever seen.

163
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,496
It's him.

164
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,004
The Health Department
has it in for Harrison,

165
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,266
'cause they say he's got
too many cats.

166
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,002
I know, I know.

167
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:56,138
Too bad for them,
Harrison has a system.

168
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,775
See a hat, don't be home.

169
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:02,048
No hat, no problem.

170
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:08,114
Another score for the cat fan.

171
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:20,869
Hey.

172
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,964
Hey.

173
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,372
Want some necklace?

174
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,639
How about you, man?

175
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,908
Ew. You got it all spitty.

176
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,778
Tastes better that way.

177
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:31,975
Good.

178
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:33,984
Hey, Harriet,
what are you writing?

179
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,144
Notes.

180
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:36,483
Can we read them?

181
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,648
Can you read this?

182
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,657
Okay, okay.

183
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,680
I just wanted to know

184
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,625
why you're always
writing like a maniac.

185
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,651
I want to remember everything.

186
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,425
I want to know everything.

187
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,863
Well, you must realize, Harriet,

188
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,890
knowing everything
won't do you a bit of good

189
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:51,993
unless you use it to put
beauty in this world.

190
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,264
True or false?

191
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:53,998
True.

192
00:12:54,038 --> 00:12:55,005
Of course it is.

193
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,438
Harriet, your mother called.

194
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,634
She's going to be late.

195
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:58,801
Come on, Sport, Janie.

196
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:00,470
I'll have you home
before dinner.

197
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,377
Golly always takes us places.

198
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:05,382
She sees things
other people barely notice.

199
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,853
She's my nanny and...
well, she's Golly.

200
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:11,446
Okay, survey of the day.

201
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:12,888
Today's question is:

202
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,824
What wouldn't you eat
for a million dollars?

203
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,759
Bratwurst.

204
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:17,761
Sport?

205
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:21,128
Um... camel boogers,
dried roadkill,

206
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,929
and my dad's meatloaf.

207
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,127
Janie?

208
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:30,833
It's the last day of summer.

209
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,900
Sad but true.

210
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,310
Au revoir, monsieur soleil.

211
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:36,973
Farewell!

212
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:37,980
So long, bye-bye.

213
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:38,981
Sayonara!

214
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,314
- Good-bye...
- We're here.

215
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,989
Is this a garden?

216
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:48,991
What a place!

217
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,992
What is this?

218
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,221
Golly, what's that?

219
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:54,254
That's Mrs. W.,
a very good friend of mine.

220
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:55,561
Kind of unusual.

221
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,568
You know, there are as many ways
to live

222
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:59,001
as there are people
in this world.

223
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,470
And each one
deserves a closer look.

224
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,337
Welcome!

225
00:14:03,374 --> 00:14:04,568
Come on in.

226
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:05,576
Hi.

227
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,577
- Hi.
- Hi.

228
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,839
Hi.

229
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,938
Look around.

230
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:11,709
Have fun.

231
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,419
Whoa! Awesome!

232
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,319
Bop, bop, bop, bop!

233
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,634
Do-wat, do-wat, do-wat

234
00:14:34,672 --> 00:14:36,037
I'm goin'!

235
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,179
Ooh.

236
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:58,627
I'm goin'!

237
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:06,595
Hey, you guys...

238
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:09,129
what do you say
I propose a toast?

239
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,607
Come on.

240
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,709
Oh... go away.

241
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,716
Say it quick, before
it stops fizzing.

242
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,241
Shake it up, take a sip,
and wish for what you want

243
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:22,253
most in the world.

244
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:23,754
Okay.

245
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:26,154
I want to replicate
my own DNA

246
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,919
and win
the Nobel Peace Prize. Yeah.

247
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,628
Oh!

248
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:31,788
Very good, Janie.

249
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:32,853
Okay, shake it up, Sport.

250
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:33,886
Shake it up.

251
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,523
I want to play
more baseball games

252
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:36,658
than Cal Ripkin, Jr.

253
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,998
Oh, yeah!

254
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:41,097
And get filthy rich doing it.

255
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,128
Oh, yeah!

256
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,971
Shake it, Harriet.

257
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:46,634
I want to see the whole world

258
00:15:46,678 --> 00:15:48,669
and I want to write down
everything.

259
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:58,717
Harriet, slow down.

260
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,316
That's very impressive.

261
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,553
Harriet?

262
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:04,595
I'm goin'!

263
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,721
That's good, Harriet.

264
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,128
That's very pretty,
isn't it, Janie?

265
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,154
Yes, I like it.

266
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,663
Got you!

267
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,119
Hey, wait up.

268
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,757
Everybody, hello!
It sucks, sixth grade!

269
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,162
Feet off the bed, please.

270
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,894
Okay.

271
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,294
Feet off.

272
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,736
Oh, the heinie bounce.

273
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,739
Good choice.

274
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,240
Very cute, Harriet,
very cute.

275
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,572
The neighbors
will ask me,

276
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,304
"What happened
to Harriet Welsch?"

277
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,311
"I don't know,"
I'll answer.

278
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,312
"Such a shame.

279
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,541
"She disappeared
without a trace.

280
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,709
And she was
so adorable."

281
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,776
How long have you been
with me, Golly?

282
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,343
Since you were born.

283
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,289
11 years and
12,000 tomato sandwiches ago.

284
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,258
And you'll never leave me,
right?

285
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,158
Well, I won't leave you
"leave you," Harriet,

286
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,425
but, you know, one day
you're going to be big enough.

287
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,626
And well... well, big enough
to take care of yourself.

288
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,759
And when that day comes

289
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,530
you won't need me
and I'll be gone.

290
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,128
But you know what?

291
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,139
That day is not today.

292
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,936
And now, it's time for bed.

293
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,738
Are Mom and Dad
tucking me in?

294
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,744
No.

295
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,769
They're at a very fancy party

296
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,873
and I bet they're thinking
about you right now. Really.

297
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,407
Listen, I think I can hear 'em.

298
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,352
Harriet...

299
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,356
listen to everything
Golly says to you.

300
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,383
We're drinking champagne
and eating caviar, Harriet.

301
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,759
Come on.

302
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,094
Let's go to bed.

303
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,598
Who's going to bed?

304
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,191
Uh, you are, tough guy.

305
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,702
- Come on.
- Ow! Ow!

306
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,725
Child abuse! Child abuse!

307
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,135
Oh, you think
that's child abuse?

308
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,639
You haven't even...
How about that?

309
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,402
What about that?
What about one of these?

310
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,438
Stand still,
you little booger.

311
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,107
Ugh!

312
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,645
I'm telling you,
just give me the big knife

313
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,051
and this will all be over.

314
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,749
Harriet, dear,
you have taken

315
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,916
a tomato sandwich
to school with you...

316
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:13,925
With mayonnaise.

317
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,256
...with mayonnaise
every day

318
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,522
for that past five years.

319
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,586
Don't you want
a little variety?

320
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,597
Nope.

321
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,395
Not even cream cheese
with olive?

322
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,491
Yum-yum-yum!

323
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,162
Or how about pastrami?
Roast beef?

324
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,764
How about the fancy
cucumber kind,

325
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,671
with the crust cut off?

326
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,644
Mom, I can't help it
if I know what I like.

327
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,546
And I know that I like tomato.

328
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,051
After school spy route...

329
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,689
Hong Fat's Food Emporium

330
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,477
Holy cats, a veggie thief.

331
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,746
This must be investigated
thoroughly.

332
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,759
Frankie, you took the truck
last week.

333
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,664
Wasn't that enough?

334
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,793
Stop walking around.

335
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:06,168
Frankie, go do some homework.

336
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,331
I've done my homework.

337
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,340
Do some reading.

338
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,602
Watch TV.
Do something.

339
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,108
Grandpa, all I need
is the truck.

340
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,371
I know you know
that I mean.

341
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,379
Come on, Ma,
let me have the truck.

342
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:21,553
I got a date!

343
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,145
What do you take me for?

344
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:26,316
The Hong Fats have a son...
Frankie.

345
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,656
He's cool; American style.

346
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,992
His parents are
Chinese-style cool.

347
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,656
Frankie likes going out,

348
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,996
but they'd rather
he work in the store,

349
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,298
selling milk and bread
and lizards.

350
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,539
Ugh!

351
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,753
I mean, do I try to interfere
with your bookkeeping?!

352
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,016
My business is comedy!

353
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,249
That's what I do!

354
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,848
I'm funny!
I'm the funny guy!

355
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:00,859
Yes, you are.

356
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,554
They're the money guys.

357
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,561
Okay, slippery,

358
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,562
bath time's over.

359
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,824
Come out with your hands up.

360
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:06,831
But I just got in.

361
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,457
Oh, sure.
I believe that one.

362
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,468
Let's see your fingers,
prune girl.

363
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,299
Talk to the hand,
'cause the face

364
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,429
ain't gonna listen.

365
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,099
He asked me to come up

366
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,903
with something new,
something fresh.

367
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,170
You read it.
It was good.

368
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,734
- Yes.
- It was the funniest script

369
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,767
we've had all year!

370
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,542
Yes, it was. So what
was their problem?

371
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,071
Hey, I want to hear.

372
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,380
Oh, yeah?
I want to sing opera,

373
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,249
but I can't, so I don't.

374
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,447
That downstairs is...

375
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:34,323
Well, your dad
has a high-pressure job.

376
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,656
What's a high-pressure job?

377
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,628
It's when you don't
get to do what you want

378
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,687
and when you do,

379
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,992
you don't have time to do it.

380
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,865
Do spies have
high-pressure jobs?

381
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,664
Only when
they're caught.

382
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm never caught.

383
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,198
You're right.

384
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,399
You never are.

385
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,067
Oh, look, a ugly water bug!

386
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,768
Hey!

387
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,835
Caught ya.

388
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,175
Here she is.

389
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,586
Night.

390
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,587
Good night.

391
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,612
Good night. You want
me to tuck you in?

392
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,782
Golly can do it.

393
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,595
"'The time has come,'
the Walrus said.

394
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,120
"To talk of many things."

395
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,655
"Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax."

396
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,724
"Of cabbages and kings."

397
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,098
"And why the sea

"And whether
pigs have wings."'

399
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,437
- Do you have any wings?
- Yeah.

400
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,460
Let me see.

401
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,244
Crap? No, no.

402
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,808
This stuff is beyond crap.

403
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,650
This is what crap wants
to be when it grows up.

404
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,814
Listen to this.

00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,086
"A Question Corner

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,631
Does she mention
her mom pays for dork lessons?

411
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:54,639
Man, once that

412
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,608

Mom and Dad's night out.

416
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,281
Me and Golly's night in.

417
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,511
Hello.

418
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,147
What's that smell?

419
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,951
Delicious
German bratwurst.

420
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,958
We hate bratwurst.

421
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,619
I love bratwurst.

422
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,787
Since when?

423
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:19,156
I'll get it!

424
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,789
No. No, no. I will get it.

425
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,356
I'll get it! I'll get it!
I'll get it!

426
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,369
I'll get it!
I'll get it! I'll get it!

427
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,597
I said I'll get it

428
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,968
and I mean
I'll get it.

429
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,529
- I got it!
- No.

430
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,974
I'll get it!

431
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,636
Good evening, Katherine.

432
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,305
The veggie thief.

433
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,643
Katherine?

434
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,148
Harriet Ann Welsch,

435
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,979
Mr. George Waldenstein.

436
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,712
How do you do?

437
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,312
Yeah.

438
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,516
I've seen him around.

439
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,354
Bet he stole that pineapple.

440
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,493
Good soup.

441
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,687
Harriet,

442
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:25,060
where are your manners?

443
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,064
I don't know.

444
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,123
Maybe somebody stole them.

445
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,096
Hey, you cheated.

446
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,464
Oh, you win.

447
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,700
My congratulations.

448
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,674
Yeah, well, I know some stuff.

449
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,108
So, you're

450
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,111
a delivery boy?

451
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,578
Mm-hmm.

452
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,946
Well, no offense, but, uh,
you're like, what, 45?

453
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,280
Ish.

454
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,945
Shouldn't you be
a delivery man by now?

455
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,510
Harriet!

456
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,614
Well, Harriet, I'll tell you.

457
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,955
Not long ago,
I had another life.

458
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,086
I had a big business,
I had a lot of money,

459
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,095
and you know what?

460
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,496
I was the most
miserable man alive.

461
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,467
So, one day,
I told my wife that...

462
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,162
- Wife?
- I told my wife that I

463
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,398
wanted to start all over
again and if she wanted to,

464
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,838
she could start all over
with me.

465
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,465
So what happened?

466
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:46,306
Oh, she left me, but that's
all right, that was her choice.

467
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,812
My choice was to become
a delivery boy... well, man.

468
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,576
I don't have the
business, of course.

469
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:51,741
I don't have the money.

470
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,751
You know what?

471
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,151
My life is sweet again.

472
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,758
Hmm.

473
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,423
The wurst!

474
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:06,590
Oh, no! My wurst!

475
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,757
No, no!

476
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,063
Oh...

477
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,070
Oh, Lord.

478
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,366
Oh, no. No.

479
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,497
Don't be sad, Katherine.

480
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,938
This is a blessing
in disguise.

481
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,770
That's a pretty
good disguise.

482
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:18,833
Don't you see?

483
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,469
The three of us
have to go out for dinner.

484
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,479
- No.
- Yeah!

485
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,947
Yes, dinner and a movie!

486
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,882
Movie, movie, movie!
Come on, Golly!

487
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,475
The idea seems
popular enough.

488
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,713
Yes, but the Welschs...

489
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,721
Will be out.

490
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,950
Till million o'clock!

491
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,652
- Oh, please, Golly.
- Please, oh, please?

492
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,355
Oh, please, please,
please, oh, please.

493
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,295
Oh, please, please, please.

494
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,593
What the heck.

495
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,168
This is absurd.

496
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:42,823
Yes!

497
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,726
Don't speak.

498
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,662
Wait! Wait for me!
I'm not dead.

499
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,638
Are you okay?

500
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,909
Yeah.

501
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,142
Hey.

502
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,173
How come
all the lights are on?

503
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,049
Where is my child?

504
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,883
Uh-oh.

505
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,445
Harriet? Harriet,
what are you doing

506
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,457
in that contraption?

507
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,924
Come in here at once.

508
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,050
Miss Golly,
what are you doing

509
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,890
with my child, at this hour,
without my consent?

510
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,156
- Who is that?
- My name is...

511
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,163
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry.

512
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,664
We only went to dinner
and then a movie.

513
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,633
Harriet is not
your daughter, Miss Golly.

514
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,567
She is mine,
and you have no idea, none,

515
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,127
what it is like
to come home and find

516
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,934
- that your child is missing.
- We had no idea

517
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,064
that you'd be home this soon.

518
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,734
I don't care.
I don't care what you did

519
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:31,834
or where you went or why.

520
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,742
All I know is this
can never happen again.

521
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,237
Miss Golly... you are fired.

522
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,249
What?! No!

523
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,580
Just a moment.

524
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,677
This is my fault. Please.

525
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,950
Well, it seems
awfully sudden.

526
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,149
Actually...

527
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,489
maybe it's not.

528
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,961
I think you're right,
Mrs. Welsch.

529
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,861
It is time for me to go.

530
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:54,832
What?

531
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:55,890
What?

532
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,333
What?

533
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,332
Now, look, I admit, I lost it...

534
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,103
because, I just...
I was frightened.

535
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,576
But the thing is, the fact is
we need you, Golly.

536
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,579
We can't do it alone.

537
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,514
We all spoke out of turn,
I think.

538
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,245
None of this is causing...

539
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,082
Absolutely not.

540
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,087
Absolutely, no.

541
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,715
I mean, I think we were
talking about...

542
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,156
our feelings out there.

543
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,057
You were afraid
and-and-and now

544
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,358
what we should
be focusing on, right?

545
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,556
Is-is Harriet.

546
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,087
Look, I'm sorry.

547
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,463
- I lost my head out there.
- Look. There.

548
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,865
- No, no.
- I was just...

549
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,926
but you can't go...
I mean, we need you.

550
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:33,868
Harriet would never
stand for it.

551
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,236
Please, won't
you reconsider?

552
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,740
You know, it's not about

553
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,208
what happened
outside tonight.

554
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,232
It really isn't.

555
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,437
But Golly...

556
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,947
I just... no, I think it's time.
I really do.

557
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,608
Harriet can take care of herself
now, so she should.

558
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,742
But Harriet's just...

559
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,911
She's just a little girl.

560
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,443
You know, it's the right thing.

561
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,251
It's the right thing
for all of us...

562
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:56,283
for me, for you
and for Harriet.

563
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,297
Are you sure?

564
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,891
Yeah, I am.

565
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,144
"'The time has come,"
the Walrus said,"

566
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,669
"To talk of many things...

567
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,774
"Of shoes and ships
and sealing wax..."

568
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,156
"Of cabbages and kings...

569
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,592
"And why the sea
is boiling hot...

570
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:32,995
And whether pigs have wings."

571
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,982
Where you going to go?

572
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,015
Well, I don't really know.

573
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,151
I'm thinking I may travel.

574
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,722
Are you going to go be
some other kid's nanny now?

575
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:09,962
And love them more than you?

576
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:11,228
Never.

577
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,705
Remember, in my life,
in this world

578
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,708
there will always
only be one Harriet.

579
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,638
So get back to work...
you've lost nearly

580
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:23,909
an entire day
on your notebook.

581
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,712
It doesn't matter.

582
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,911
It doesn't matter?

583
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,648
Did I hear you say
"It doesn't matter"?

584
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,155
Because I thought
I heard you say

585
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,156
"It doesn't matter,"

586
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,680
but Harriet wouldn't say that,
would she?

587
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,692
Now come on...

588
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,421
just because
you're on your own,

589
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,691
doesn't mean the world
stops turning,

590
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,994
or that there are
no more fascinating people

591
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,193
to observe and fill
your notebooks with.

592
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,135
That's your job, Harriet.

593
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,001
That's your job for life.

594
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,266
And when you're all grown up

595
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,571
and you sell
your first novel,

596
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,976
I'll be first in line
at that bookstore,

597
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,775
getting my autographed copy.

598
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:58,544
I hope.

599
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,344
I'm not going to cry.

600
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,921
I'm not going to cry.

601
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,425
I'm not going
to cry.

602
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,052
Ah, it's okay to cry.

603
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,960
But whatever you do,
don't laugh.

604
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,429
No, Harriet,

605
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,696
I will not tolerate laughter
as I leave, no.

606
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,758
Hey...

607
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,293
come here.

608
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,773
You remember...

609
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,278
a good spy can
get in there and fight.

610
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:55,172
Good-bye, Harriet the Spy.

611
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:15,823
I was kind of worried, you know?

612
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,953
I kind of thought, "Well,
there's something wrong

613
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,360
with me or something," and so...

614
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,166
Growing up from girl to woman,

615
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,796
there's so much to get used to.

616
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:32,070
This is the time when a whole
new set of feelings unfold.

617
00:33:32,109 --> 00:33:36,637
Feelings about yourself
and your maturing body...

618
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,980
Everything's the same
as when Golly was here.

619
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,283
It looks the same...

620
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:48,223
it smells the same...

621
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,227
but there's this
tiny hole inside me

622
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,819
that wasn't there before.

623
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,458
It's like...

624
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:00,697
like a splinter
in your finger...

625
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,102
only this one's
right above my stomach.

626
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,787
Harriet,

627
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:22,416
are you okay?

628
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:25,053
Uh-huh.

629
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,439
Something's... different.

630
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,752
No cats?

631
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,521
How can Harrison Withers
not have a billion cats around?

632
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,609
They finally nailed him.

633
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,959
I will always remember
that face.

634
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:38,092
That's the face you make
when you really lose something.

635
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:47,239
Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck.

636
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,051
Speak English!

637
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,927
Oh, okay, you want us
to speak English, huh?!

638
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:08,862
Well, you are a jerk, huh?

639
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,561
I tell you, "Don't
take the truck.

640
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,762
You smash the truck."

641
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,100
Well, you tell me now,

642
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,628
Mr. Wise Guy,
was one date worth it?

643
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,935
...we have people
here shopping!

644
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,508
Yeah.

645
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,871
Hey, all right, Grandpa.

646
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:26,075
It's cool, right?

647
00:36:26,116 --> 00:36:27,845
It wasn't a big deal, huh?

648
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,182
I knew you'd
understand, right?

649
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:36,252
Sometimes I think
families everywhere

650
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,420
are exactly the same.

651
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,123
Everybody get back to work.

652
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,428
Mom, Dad, please?
Grandpa!

653
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,661
Just calm down.

654
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:49,294
Too exciting.

655
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,702
$6.75.

656
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:12,822
You got it or not?

657
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:29,277
Hey, Sport.

658
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,780
How you doing?

659
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,339
Hi.

660
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:38,744
Um, I saw you drop this outside.

661
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,450
Oh...

662
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,690
Thanks.

663
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,329
I got to go.

664
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,752
Now it's time for our annual
sixth grade holiday pageant.

665
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,623
So... pageant ideas...

666
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,150
who would like
to make a suggestion?

667
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,060
Simon.

668
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,325
Pirates.

669
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,459
Okay.

670
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,072
Good dramatic potential,
if not exactly seasonal.

671
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,733
Anyone else?

672
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,441
How 'bout the Manhattan Project?

673
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,207
I can be J. Robert Oppenheimer

674
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,942
and with the right chemicals,

675
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:40,039
I know I can do
a mushroom cloud.

676
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,075
That's impressive, Janie.

677
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,055
But I believe there's
a taste issue involved.

678
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,079
Ballet.

679
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,284
Pilgrims.

680
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,622
Musical.

681
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,457
Swan Lake.

682
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,364
Jazz.

683
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,389
Vlad the lmpaler.

684
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,527
Yeah, that's cool!

685
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:03,097
I think the most excellent idea
for a pageant

686
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,631
would be
a giant holiday feast.

687
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:10,079
Something healthy, low in fat,
and very delicious, of course.

688
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,548
There could be parts
for everybody.

689
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:16,679
Uh, grains, vegetables

690
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,451
and best of all,
a shiny, silver centerpiece.

691
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,425
That's a very good idea, Marion.

692
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,825
You could play the barf bag.

693
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,729
She made me an onion.

694
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,857
Tell me about it.

695
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,300
"You, my dear,
are a great big squash."

696
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,099
I'd like to squash her.

697
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,402
I've got something better.
Come here.

698
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,370
Smell this.

699
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,609
Ugh!

700
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,946
What is that?

701
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:48,177
You like it?

702
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,948
Wait, I mean you hate it.

703
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,784
It's like something crawled
up my nose and then died.

704
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:53,790
Excellent.

705
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,621
It's a sulfur-based
alkaloid.

706
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,718
I want it to chemically
fuse with combustibles.

707
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,457
And, in English,
that would mean...

708
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:01,623
Stink bomb.

709
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,257
Stink bomb.

710
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,961
We tape it to the
school air ducts,

711
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,094
attach it to a timer,

712
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:08,627
and five minutes before
the school play starts...

713
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,165
Empty auditorium.

714
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,176
Hey...

715
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,873
What are you girls doing?

716
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,575
Nothing.
Nothing.

717
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,244
Are you getting ready
for your big stage debut?

718
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,411
Actually, Mrs. Gibbs,

719
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,819
Janie and I were just talking
about the school play.

720
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,981
Right, Janie?

721
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,923
Yeah, we're really
looking forward to it.

722
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:31,460
Good, good.

723
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,258
That's good.

724
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,925
Janie, what is this
supposed to be?

725
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:36,990
No, Mom.

726
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:37,625
Don't touch it.

727
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,264
What?!

728
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:43,534
Janie!

729
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,667
It's an experiment with mold.

730
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,836
Oh... Janie!

731
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,245
That's where my Veronica's
Closet bra went to, huh?

732
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,113
You know,
I'm sick to death

733
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,015
of this mad scientist baloney.

734
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,110
Look at this.
Look at this.

735
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,211
Girl, we got to talk.

736
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,949
I don't know what I'm
going to do with you,

737
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,014
but we're going
to talk.

738
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,219
Some of Janie's experiments
really creep me out.

739
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,526
I wonder if she'll grow up
to be a billion-IQ genius,

740
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:09,828
or a total nutcase.

741
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,721
Sport, Sport...

742
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,899
Chicken man.

743
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,043
Do it again, do it again.

744
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,289
Sport.

745
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,825
Sport...

746
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,861
Sport!

747
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,038
Help me.

748
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,906
Hey, Harriet.

749
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,414
Hey.

750
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,043
All right, come on.

751
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,288
How does it look?

752
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,822
Uh...
give me the mousse.

753
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,966
No, no...

754
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:31,736
Don't worry, it's just
one of Dad's nightmares.

755
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,140
I mean day-mares.

756
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,168
He says it happens
to all great writers

757
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:36,941
before they get their big break.

758
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,710
Hmm, a real writer.

759
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,853
My dad calls guys like your dad
"a starving artist."

760
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,552
Who's starving?

761
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:53,461
I cook, I clean,
I do the dishes and the books.

762
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,328
What do you mean,
do the books?

763
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,297
These are the books.

764
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,305
Every week I get a check.

765
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,034
I write the amount
down in here,

766
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,305
I pay the bills and then
whatever's left is food money.

767
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,902
I hate money.

768
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,109
You'd like it a lot more
if you didn't have any.

769
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:15,016
I got to get to work.

770
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,318
Hey, Sport?

771
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:27,728
No! Don't.

772
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:28,924
Yeah, yeah, come on.

773
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,058
Strike a pose.

774
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:42,739
Spy route: Brand-new stalk.

775
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:45,270
Home of Agatha K. Plummer,

776
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:49,479
a big private house
with big-type security.

777
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:52,716
Until today.

778
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:20,711
A spy must choose
ingenious tricks,

779
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,742
must blend
into her surroundings.

780
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:25,754
Hiya, Freckles.

781
00:45:25,788 --> 00:45:28,916
Must live with being called...
"Freckles."

782
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,933
Here we go, in you go.

783
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,975
Here he is.

784
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:47,566
So, here's the little monster.

785
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,443
Bye. Wave to the man.

786
00:45:53,816 --> 00:45:54,976
Are you happy?

787
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,145
Good.

788
00:46:10,066 --> 00:46:12,364
Oh, score!

789
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:58,972
Quiet. Quiet, puppy dog.

790
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:00,606
Go away!

791
00:47:02,185 --> 00:47:03,345
Don't, don't, don't.
Go away.

792
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,252
Pee-wee, don't make me
come in there.

793
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,780
Away.

794
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,950
Go away!

795
00:47:14,163 --> 00:47:17,132
Pee-wee... get away

796
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,600
from that dumbwaiter.

797
00:47:19,635 --> 00:47:21,728
Shut up.

798
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:25,831
Stupid fuzzball.

799
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:29,777
I ought to shave you down
and teach you to hunt.

800
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,367
Shut up!

801
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:38,269
No, no.

802
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:39,611
No, darling.

803
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:42,641
If you want to talk about
something delicious...

804
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,946
...I have

805
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:46,488
something delicious.

806
00:48:46,522 --> 00:48:49,320
I have the secret of life.

807
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,655
Yes, darling.

808
00:48:50,693 --> 00:48:51,887
You simply

809
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,452
crawl into your bed,

810
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:56,158
and you never, ever
leave it again.

811
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:58,527
Never...

812
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,537
Ah, sweet Liberace.

813
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:07,174
What was that?

814
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,734
I have no idea.

815
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,905
Then why don't you

816
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,279
go over there and get an idea?

817
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:18,921
And if it's that rat...

818
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:20,922
kill it!

819
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,719
Oh, Mrs. Plummer,

820
00:49:22,758 --> 00:49:23,782
I'm sure

821
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,817
it's absolutely nothing.

822
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:37,396
Oh, well...

823
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:41,934
A good spy never gets caught.

824
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,946
A good spy
never gets caught.

825
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,746
A good spy never gets caught.

826
00:49:47,783 --> 00:49:50,411
I am the suckiest spy on earth.

827
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,719
Hey, Harriet, check this out.

828
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:57,851
"This year's winter
pageant promises

829
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:01,295
"to be truly inspiring,
as Miss Elson's

830
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,164
"sixth grade class

00:50:05,201 --> 00:50:07,897

"and a grand finale

00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:14,208
of delicious, dancing... gravy."

834
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:17,340
Oh, my God.

835
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:22,109
I'd like to see her
split a turkey suit

836
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,346
with butt-breath
Pinky Whitehead.

837
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:26,981
Hurry up.

838
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,285
You're so slow.

839
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:29,848
Come on, you guys.

840
00:50:29,892 --> 00:50:31,757
Harriet, you want
to go play in the park?

841
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:34,024
Or do you have to do that
top secret spy deal again?

842
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,091
No. I can play.

843
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:39,123
You can?

844
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,536
Yeah, come on.

845
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:42,698
No way.

846
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,468
I still say we play
"Buy the Volvo."

847
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:45,634
No way.

848
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,007
- That's stupid.
- No.

849
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,135
No way!

850
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:49,372
You guys, I can be the dealer.

851
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,880
You guys can be
the couples looking

852
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,643
for a sassy yet affordable
family vehicle.

853
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:53,741
Get real.

854
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,342
Yeah, right.

855
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,114
Okay, I've got it:
Hide and Seek.

856
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,019
- No.
- Hide and Seek?

857
00:50:59,089 --> 00:50:59,817
I am set.

858
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,187
That's retarded.

859
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,157
Red Rover, Red Rover.

860
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,181
No!

861
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:04,455
That's a kid's game.

862
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,927
I don't think so.

863
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,596
- Kick the can.
- Kick...

864
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,967
What about Spin the Bottle?

865
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,128
Ew!

866
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,330
Yeah, right.

867
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:16,834
I got it.

868
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,135
Bumper tag.

869
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,836
See, now, that's a good idea.

870
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:20,968
Eenie-meenie, miney-mo,

871
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,341
Catch a tiger by the toe.

872
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,744
If he hollers, let him go.

873
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,510
My mom said to pick
the very best one,

874
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,518
and you are

875
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,712
it.

876
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:35,858
Away, you foolish mortals!

877
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,019
Beth's it!

878
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,129
Got you!

879
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,233
You run fast,

880
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,833
but now I shall destroy you.

881
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:28,033
Yeah.

882
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,072
Oh.

883
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,645
You winded?

884
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,085
Nope.

885
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,180
Me, too.

886
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,018
Upsey-daisy.

887
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,322
Time to move.

888
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,277
Where's my notebook?

889
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,540
Your what?

890
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,639
My notebook!

891
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,381
Oh, my God.

892
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:46,889
Boy...

893
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:48,220
- Wait, wait. No, wait.
- Carrie...

894
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,589
Carrie.
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie.

895
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,593
Andrews.

896
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:51,594
Get this. Get... Okay.

897
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,391
"Carrie Andrews thinks
she's so cool

898
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,295

her summer vacation

growing boobs."

900
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,469
- Come on, read some more.
- Okay.

901
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:02,870
Hold on, hold on.

902
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,032
Okay.

903
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,065
"Now, the Boy with
the Purple Socks

904
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:07,406
is a man of mystery."

905
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,207
Mystery!

906
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,907
Hold on, you guys,
you guys.

907
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:11,936
Listen, listen, listen.

908
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,413
"The only thing more pathetic

909
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,815
"than being Marion Hawthorne,

910
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,285
is wanting to be
Marion Hawthorne."

911
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,651
Oh, Rachel.

912
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,882
Rachel.

913
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,288
She is...

914
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,791
- Jealous.
- She's jealous.

915
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,054
It's pure jealousy.

916
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,425
You give that back now!

917
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,327
Looks like there's something
in here for everyone.

918
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,922
You heard her, Marion.

919
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:32,423
Give it back before I pound you
into the cement.

920
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,903
Ooh, I'm so scared.

921
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,166
Hey, maybe there
is something

922
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,366
in here for you.

923
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:44,941
Janie...

924
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,676
Janie, Janie, Janie...

925
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,876
Come and get it.

926
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,442
Read it. Come on.

927
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,976
What does it say?

928
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,317
- Come on.
- Janie, Janie.

929
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,381
"Janie really
creeps me out."

930
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,585
Ooh.

931
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,720
"I wonder if she'll grow up
to be...

932
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:02,129
a total nutcase..."?

933
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,462
A nutcase!

934
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,931
Oh.

935
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,129
Hey.

936
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,432
Her best friend.

937
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,269
That's her best friend.

938
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:12,869
Beth.

939
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:17,445
"I wish
someone would kick Beth Ellen."

940
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,607
Oh!

941
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,820
Uh, Laura.

942
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:29,087
"Laura Peters...
her face looks totally...

943
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,251
pinched."

944
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,625
Oh.

945
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,492
"If I were the boy
with the purple socks...

946
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,631
I'd hang myself."

947
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,468
Something else.

948
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,738
Cut it out, Marion.

949
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,177
Oh.

950
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,443
Maybe there is something
in here for Sport.

951
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,177
No!

952
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,309
"Sport..."

953
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,284
Shut up!

954
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,286
Fine, then.

955
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,480
I'll read it right out loud

956
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,511
so everybody can hear.

957
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:01,783
No!

958
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,755
"Sport is so poor,
he can't even afford food.

959
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,922
"Why can't his father

960
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,430
just get a real job?"

961
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,625
Oh, and get this, as well.

962
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:15,661
"One day, I had to pretend
he dropped a dollar

963
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,674
just so he could afford
some milk and bread."

964
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,199
Oh.

965
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,303
Ooh, harsh.

966
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,211
Oh, oh, oh.

967
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,511
That's mean.

968
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,180
Sport, I...

969
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,347
I-I got to go.

970
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,152
It-it's spaghetti night.

971
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,953
I got to make spaghetti.

972
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,983
I can't stay here anymore.

973
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:42,460
Harriet...

974
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:45,434
sit over there till we decide
what to do with you next.

975
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:47,863
Wait. What's this?

976
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,769
"I learn everything I can

977
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,331
"and I write down everything
I see.

978
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,208
"Golly says if I
want to be a writer,

979
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,304
"then I'd better start now,

980
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,541
"which is why

981
00:56:58,582 --> 00:56:59,913
I'm a spy."

982
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,716
My position is bad.

983
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,656
My position is terrible.

984
00:57:08,692 --> 00:57:10,660
My position could not be worse.

985
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,356
Golly would know what to do.

986
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,132
Harriet?

987
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,334
Harriet, are you all right?

988
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,204
Fine.

989
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,572
Do you want anything?

990
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,043
No.

991
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:30,239
You sure?

992
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,759
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,
Ole Golly,

993
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,857
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,

994
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,802
Ole Golly, Ole Golly,
Ole Golly.

995
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,272
Harriet?

996
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,638
I said

997
00:57:58,675 --> 00:57:59,801
I'm fine.

998
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,936
Really.

999
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,124
Lookit.

1000
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:24,359
Oh, my God.

1001
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,566
Hey, Sport.

1002
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,571
Janie.

1003
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,984
You hear something?

1004
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:45,977
No.

1005
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:03,903
Plug this in over there.

1006
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,066
Over there?

1007
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:07,075
Um, well, that one's closer.

1008
00:59:07,109 --> 00:59:09,805
Carrie? Carrie?

1009
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:14,777
Oh, my...

1010
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,493
Sport? Sport, catch.

1011
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,416
Let me see.

1012
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,956
We love our teacher,
and our best friend

1013
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,265
We'll stay together

1014
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:08,964
Until the end

1015
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,064
We're moving up...

1016
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:17,069
...and together,
we'll always have fun

1017
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:21,106
We love our teacher,
and our best friend

1018
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,414
We'll stay together

1019
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:26,421
Until the end

1020
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:29,822
We're one for all,
and all for one

1021
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:33,386
And together,
we'll always have fun...

1022
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:45,901
I will always have a notebook.

1023
01:00:45,941 --> 01:00:47,932
Only Golly understands this.

1024
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,775
I will write down everything,
and I'll know everything.

1025
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,576
And I'll take everything
I know,

1026
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:53,980
and write my memoirs,

1027
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,415
and be a huge, big, celebrity,

1028
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:56,748
and go on all the talk shows

1029
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,583
and tell them
Marion Hawthorne smells.

1030
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:02,523
And... won't that rock?

1031
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,129
What smells?

1032
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,466
Eww!

1033
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:15,561
Did something die?

1034
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,298
- Get away.
- Eww!

1035
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,979
Where's your notebook, Harriet?

1036
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,282
I don't know, Marion.

1037
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,414
Have you looked
up your butt?

1038
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,190
You all better stop
being mean to me,

1039
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,785
or else, I'm going to...

1040
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,091
Or else, what?

1041
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,995
Yeah, what are you
gonna do about it?

1042
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,556
I'm gonna get you real bad.

1043
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,692
I'm gonna...

1044
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:49,136
No, that's where you're
wrong, Harriet the Spy.

1045
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:51,469
We're gonna get you so bad...

1046
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,906
and you know why?

1047
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,671
'Cause we have a plan.

1048
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,699
Yeah!

1049
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:40,147
I don't like giving orders
twice, you know.

1050
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:43,989
I told you to nail it
to the side, not to the right.

1051
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:47,995
One, two, three, heave!

1052
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,292
I need more nails.

1053
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:57,837
Harder, harder.

1054
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,984
Hold it, hold it.

1055
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,481
A club for catching spies?

1056
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:17,219
I'm doomed.

1057
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,092
"If Golly said choose
between being a spy

1058
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,127
"and having friends...

1059
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:35,373
I'd pick spy."

1060
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:43,742
Maybe you're not allowed
to have both."

1061
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:54,084
Ugh!

1062
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,989
Get her!

1063
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,526
Spy-catchers are everywhere.

1064
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,529
My route is ruined.

1065
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,895
No one can stand in my way.

1066
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,732
Forget that my heart sank

1067
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,830
when I saw you standing there
with that policeman.

1068
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:38,965
This is your mother talking.

1069
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:41,065
But when I ask you
for some kind of explanation,

1070
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,077
it's like...

1071
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:43,078
It's not that big a deal.

1072
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,079
Oh, no... wrong.

1073
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,410
Being brought home by the cops

1074
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:46,573
is a very big deal, Harriet.

1075
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:48,242
Cop. Cop.

1076
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,481
One guy. That's it.

1077
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,545
No, that's not it;
we've spoken with Miss Elson.

1078
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:54,681
You remember school?

1079
01:04:54,723 --> 01:04:56,554
And she tells us
that you've done

1080
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:57,923
zero schoolwork in days.

1081
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,087
All you do is play
with your notebook.

1082
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,063
It's not play, it's work.

1083
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:04,395
School is your
work, Harriet.

1084
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:08,426
Yeah, well, she can shut up,
'cause I'm learning tons.

1085
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,437
Oh, yes?

1086
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:11,029
Well, not about history, huh?

1087
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,097
Not about geography.

1088
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,108
Not even English.

1089
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,133
I swear, if it's
not in your notebook,

1090
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,475
it's as if you don't
want to know about it.

1091
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,947
So what?

1092
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,374
Harriet...

1093
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:33,225
This... obsession
you've developed

1094
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,924
is not entirely
healthy.

1095
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:39,492
Now, we've made
a decision.

1096
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:40,559
And-And we, uh...

1097
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:41,695
We want you to stop

1098
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:42,965
with the notebook.

1099
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:50,104
S-Stop writing?

1100
01:05:50,145 --> 01:05:54,309
Not forever,
just as an experiment.

1101
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,614
Harriet, the world is filled
with so many things

1102
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,279
a person like yourself
could enjoy.

1103
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,878
Well, that's right.

1104
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,857
And you're going to find that,
sometimes

1105
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:05,724
just experiencing
them can be enough.

1106
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:09,925
That's how I experience things...
with my notebook.

1107
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,226
Harriet...

1108
01:06:11,266 --> 01:06:14,133
No. Let's see you
experience things

1109
01:06:14,169 --> 01:06:17,400
without your unhealthy
obsessions, huh?

1110
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:19,930
Every day you come home,
and pour yourself a big martini.

1111
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,532
How come you don't
give that up?

1112
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,568
And how many days go by

1113
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,341
without you going
to a stupid party?

1114
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:28,248
Or buying some other piece
of crappy jewelry... like, two?

1115
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:29,944
Don't take that tone with us,
young lady.

1116
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,282
We're your parents.
We make the rules in this house.

1117
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,515
Now, hand over
the notebook.

1118
01:06:33,555 --> 01:06:35,489
I threw it away.

1119
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,890
You're sitting on it.

1120
01:06:37,926 --> 01:06:40,554
I'm not moving.

1121
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,089
If you make me move you,

1122
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,192
I will move you.

1123
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:04,583
I'll just get another one.

1124
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,609
Oh?

1125
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,418
Miss Elson will be checking.

1126
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,059
Harriet?

1127
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,263
Don't you want
to talk about this?

1128
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,730
No.

1129
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:27,433
Harriet... did we forget?

1130
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:30,877
Notebook check.

1131
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,923
Dweeb!

1132
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,254
Hey...

1133
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,211
Harriet the Spy,
Harriet the Spy...

1134
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:26,551
Harriet the Spy,
Harriet the Spy...

1135
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,900
Oops!

1136
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,396
I'm sorry!

1137
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,200
You did that
on purpose!

1138
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,332
It was an accident,
I swear.

1139
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:41,365
- Here, let me help you.
- No!

1140
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:46,939
Get away!

1141
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,542
Get away!

1142
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:52,850
That's it, work together,

1143
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,356
and we'll have Harriet
cleaned up in no time.

1144
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:56,550
Don't worry, Harriet,

1145
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,787
we'll all help you.

1146
01:09:58,827 --> 01:09:59,816
No, stop it.

1147
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,352
I don't need your help.

1148
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:02,624
You all get away!

1149
01:10:02,664 --> 01:10:03,790
No!

1150
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,823
No!

1151
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,541
Harriet!

1152
01:10:13,575 --> 01:10:14,803
Wait!

1153
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,970
Whoa...

1154
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,446
Well, that wasn't
very dignified.

1155
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:47,159
"To be... or not to be...

1156
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,534
"That is the question.

1157
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:51,334
Wait.

1158
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,204
Is that a question?

1159
01:11:55,877 --> 01:12:02,146
"Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

1160
01:12:02,183 --> 01:12:04,378
"The slings and arrows

1161
01:12:04,419 --> 01:12:06,614
"Of outrageous fortune

1162
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,486
"Or to take arms

1163
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:11,924
"Against a sea of terribles

1164
01:12:14,262 --> 01:12:15,957
"And by optioning, end them?

1165
01:12:15,997 --> 01:12:16,964
"To die...

1166
01:12:16,998 --> 01:12:18,124
I want to die.

1167
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,963
"To sleep no more

1168
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,299
"And by a sleep to say

1169
01:12:22,337 --> 01:12:24,328
"We end the heart-chat

01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:26,704
"And the thousand

01:12:26,741 --> 01:12:28,902
"The flesh

1172
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:31,878
"is here, too...

1173
01:12:31,913 --> 01:12:34,381
"'Tis a consummation

1174
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:39,854
"Development to be wished

1175
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:46,623
To die... to sleep no more."

1176
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:50,324
There are many signs that Tom
is changing from a boy to a man.

1177
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:52,196
Tom is getting a deeper voice

1178
01:12:52,233 --> 01:12:54,997
and sometimes it gives him
a little trouble.

1179
01:12:55,036 --> 01:12:56,333
Don't be insulting

1180
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,998
my... friend.

1181
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:01,600
This is an actual photograph
of vocal chords taken through

1182
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,543
a special instrument.

1183
01:13:03,578 --> 01:13:05,944
The chords vibrate
when the person breathes out.

1184
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,775
The larynx is here
at the top of the windpipe

1185
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:13,310
and is the housing
for the vocal cords.

1186
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,171
Bra on a pole!
Bra on a pole!

1187
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,021
Oh, no.

1188
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:10,268
Hello, Marion.

1189
01:14:10,311 --> 01:14:12,939
Get away from me, Harriet.

1190
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:17,611
Or what, you gonna
tell your father?

1191
01:14:17,652 --> 01:14:20,416
I heard my parents talking.

1192
01:14:21,656 --> 01:14:23,624
You don't have a father.

1193
01:14:23,658 --> 01:14:27,287
All those stories about
horseback riding are garbage.

1194
01:14:27,328 --> 01:14:29,455
You made them all up.

1195
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:32,625
Your father lives in Amsterdam.

1196
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:36,296
He hasn't seen you
in three years.

1197
01:14:36,337 --> 01:14:39,500
And you want to know why,
Marion?

1198
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,979
'Cause he
doesn't love you.

1199
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:47,004
Move.

1200
01:15:51,512 --> 01:15:53,673
Harriet?

1201
01:15:54,849 --> 01:15:57,511
Harriet, come down here.

1202
01:16:01,556 --> 01:16:04,423
Harriet, what's happened to you?

1203
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,917
We've gotten calls
from every parent at school.

1204
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:10,020
They're all either
furious or terrified.

1205
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:11,429
Marion Hawthorne
can't stop crying.

1206
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:13,593
Laura Peters has locked herself
in the bathroom

1207
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:14,829
and won't come out.

1208
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:16,496
The only parents
we haven't heard from

1209
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:17,629
are Pinky Whitehead's.

1210
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:20,899
I'm not answering that.

1211
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:22,500
I always hated school myself.

1212
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:23,805
No, now, see,
that's the problem.

1213
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:24,903
What? I know...

1214
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:26,573
Something is very wrong here,
Ben, and you need

1215
01:16:26,614 --> 01:16:27,808
...to take this seriously.
- I am!

1216
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,248
- No, come on.
- I'm just as serious as...

1217
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:30,273
You know what you're doing.

1218
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:31,945
- You're coming in and teasing...
- No, I'm not.

1219
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,952
We have a really
bad situation.

1220
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:34,420
We don't know what
the situation is at all.

1221
01:16:34,455 --> 01:16:36,252
You always come in and make
jokes and then I have to come in

1222
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,280
Do we know
what the situation is?

1223
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:38,292
...and be the grumpy one.

1224
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:39,452
Maybe we should find out
what it is.

1225
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,588
I'm fine, I'm fine...

1226
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,655
I'm fine,
I'm fine...

1227
01:16:44,699 --> 01:16:46,792
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine...

1228
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:48,426
I'm fine!

1229
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:50,732
No, sweetheart.

1230
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,832
I can't understand
how this is fine.

1231
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:58,009
Harriet, uh, uh,
can you explain this?

1232
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,933
Well, what do we do now?

1233
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,508
We can do anything you like.

1234
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,408
What am I supposed to do?

1235
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,037
How about a game?

1236
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,809
Do you play chess?

1237
01:17:33,848 --> 01:17:36,612
Golly was going
to teach me, but...

1238
01:17:36,651 --> 01:17:37,777
Golly?

1239
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,150
Who's he?

1240
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:42,615
Just somebody.

1241
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:47,953
You sit here and play
with this stuff all day?

1242
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:49,291
Don't you have toys at home?

1243
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:50,490
Yeah.

1244
01:17:50,531 --> 01:17:51,930
But I'm 11.

1245
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:06,112
You stink.

1246
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:07,546
What are you doing?

1247
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:08,913
Just taking notes.

1248
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,281
Are they the mean,

1249
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:14,880
nasty kind...
or the regular kind?

1250
01:18:14,922 --> 01:18:16,787
Why?

1251
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:18,416
Because...

1252
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:19,756
I'm just telling you,

1253
01:18:19,794 --> 01:18:23,230
it's tough getting away
with the nasty kind these days.

1254
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:24,959
Thanks for the advice.

1255
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,935
Nobody ever takes

1256
01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:30,163
your notebook away from you,
I bet.

1257
01:18:31,072 --> 01:18:33,734
Tell you what.

1258
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:36,243
How about I give
you a notebook.

1259
01:18:36,277 --> 01:18:40,111
Would you like that?

1260
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,582
Yeah. Sure.

1261
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:44,107
This guy's not bad.

1262
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:46,518
Definitely one of those people

1263
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:49,216
Golly says deserves
a closer look.

1264
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,954
At least he knows the value
of a good notebook.

1265
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:54,518
Harriet?

1266
01:18:54,562 --> 01:18:55,927
Hmm?

1267
01:18:55,963 --> 01:18:57,396
It's time to go.

1268
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:01,300
Can I keep the notebook?

1269
01:19:01,335 --> 01:19:03,769
I'll have to talk
to your parents about that.

1270
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:13,410
Well, what did he say?

1271
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,177
What did he say?

1272
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:19,084
Well, he says that, uh,
you're fine.

1273
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,921
And, uh, you're a wonderful girl
and very smart

1274
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:27,086
and you'll be
a terrific writer some day.

1275
01:19:27,128 --> 01:19:29,619
I could've told you that.

1276
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,050
I didn't read it.

1277
01:19:58,092 --> 01:19:59,957
Good.

1278
01:19:59,994 --> 01:20:01,894
You know, Harriet,

1279
01:20:01,929 --> 01:20:06,832
uh, someday... when you grow up...
you might have children.

1280
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:08,893
Doubt it.

1281
01:20:08,936 --> 01:20:11,234
Well, not tomorrow,

1282
01:20:11,272 --> 01:20:13,797
or soon, but some day.

1283
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:15,433
Maybe.

1284
01:20:15,476 --> 01:20:17,410
And, if you do,

1285
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:20,642
you're going to try really hard
to understand them.

1286
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:21,978
But I keep telling you...

1287
01:20:22,049 --> 01:20:24,108
I know, you told me
about the notebook.

1288
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,949
And even though
you're telling me,

1289
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,579
and even though
I'm listening,

1290
01:20:27,622 --> 01:20:30,318
I still don't
understand it, Harriet.

1291
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:33,657
Is that why you
took it away?

1292
01:20:33,694 --> 01:20:36,026
We made a mistake.

1293
01:20:39,033 --> 01:20:42,491
Don't do it
again, okay?

1294
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:44,027
We try.

1295
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:50,002
Mom?

1296
01:20:50,044 --> 01:20:51,170
Yeah?

1297
01:20:51,212 --> 01:20:52,611
Will you tuck me in?

1298
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,877
Sure.

1299
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:00,483
There we go.

1300
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:10,194
Green.

1301
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:11,698
G-R-E-E-N.

1302
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:14,462
Aren't you going to work
on your notebook today?

1303
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:15,594
Yeah. Pick a number.

1304
01:21:16,637 --> 01:21:17,865
Seven.

1305
01:21:17,905 --> 01:21:20,703
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

1306
01:21:20,741 --> 01:21:22,265
All right.

1307
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,279
"Turn around."

1308
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:26,905
That's not a fortune.

1309
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,313
Turn around.

1310
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:30,214
Why?

1311
01:21:30,251 --> 01:21:32,310
Turn around.

1312
01:21:32,353 --> 01:21:34,685
Golly?

1313
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,581
Golly!

1314
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,330
Why, Harriet the Spy,

1315
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:52,168
I believe you've grown
a full inch.

1316
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:54,504
Nuh-uh.

1317
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,339
You certainly have grown.

1318
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:58,277
Oh, Golly!

1319
01:21:59,313 --> 01:22:02,111
So what do I do now, Golly?

1320
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:05,175
"Beauty is truth,
truth beauty.

1321
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:06,948
"That is all
ye know on Earth

1322
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:08,282
and all ye need
to know."

1323
01:22:08,322 --> 01:22:09,949
John Keats.

1324
01:22:10,057 --> 01:22:11,922
What is that
supposed to mean?

1325
01:22:11,959 --> 01:22:13,517
It means you've
got trouble.

1326
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,153
You wrote down the
truth in your notebook,

1327
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:17,357
and your friends, who weren't
supposed to see it, did.

1328
01:22:17,398 --> 01:22:19,298
Now there are only two
things for you to do,

1329
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:21,460
and you're not going to
like either one of them.

1330
01:22:21,502 --> 01:22:23,834
Like what?

1331
01:22:23,871 --> 01:22:28,069
Well, you have to apologize
and you have to lie.

1332
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,907
But you said never to lie.

1333
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:33,311
I know, I did.

1334
01:22:33,347 --> 01:22:36,145
Let me see how
I can explain this.

1335
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:40,882
Sometimes a little lie that
makes people feel better

1336
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,980
isn't really wrong.

1337
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,492
You know, like,
you can thank someone

1338
01:22:45,526 --> 01:22:48,188
for a meal they cooked you,
even if you hated it.

1339
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,356
You could tell a sick friend
that they look better,

1340
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,696
even if they don't.

1341
01:22:52,733 --> 01:22:56,863
Sometimes a really small lie
can be a really big help.

1342
01:22:56,904 --> 01:23:00,465
They tried to squash me
like a bug.

1343
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:02,635
It's too hard.

1344
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,406
It's not worth it.

1345
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:07,175
Aw, never say
that, Harriet.

1346
01:23:07,214 --> 01:23:08,613
You're worth it.

1347
01:23:08,649 --> 01:23:10,640
You're an individual,
and you know something?

1348
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:12,175
That makes people nervous.

1349
01:23:12,219 --> 01:23:14,619
And it's going to keep making
people nervous your whole life.

1350
01:23:14,655 --> 01:23:15,952
My whole life?

1351
01:23:16,023 --> 01:23:17,115
Yep.

1352
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,853
What do I do?

1353
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:21,487
You stay true to Harriet
and you accept the cost.

1354
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,655
Now, come on.

1355
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,961
That's enough lessons
for today, okay?

1356
01:23:25,032 --> 01:23:26,727
You're 11.

1357
01:23:26,767 --> 01:23:29,634
I think it's time for you
to start writing something

1358
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:31,604
other than notes.

1359
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:33,163
Like what?

1360
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:34,868
You'll think of something.

1361
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:38,310
Can't you come back
for just a little while?

1362
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:41,941
Oh, no, I never go back.
Only forward.

1363
01:23:41,982 --> 01:23:44,075
And you know what else?

1364
01:23:44,118 --> 01:23:46,518
Good friends are one
of life's blessings.

1365
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,852
Don't give them up
without a fight.

1366
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:04,094
Replicate.
Replicate.

1367
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:06,936
Stupid spores.

1368
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,533
Hi, Janie.

1369
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,171
Look what you made me do.

1370
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,770
This stuff is going to eat

1371
01:24:12,814 --> 01:24:14,281
right through the floor.

1372
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:19,253
Three months of incubation
down the porcelain pee hole.

1373
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,492
If you roll the rug over it,
it won't show so much.

1374
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:27,393
Oh, so next time you
can ruin the rug?

1375
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,521
No.

1376
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,087
Then why are you here?

1377
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,497
I just want to say that...

1378
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,560
What?

1379
01:24:35,604 --> 01:24:37,663
Forget it.

1380
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:39,298
Fine.

1381
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,933
Forget it.

1382
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:53,984
I'm sorry, Janie, okay?

1383
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,887
I'm sorry.

1384
01:25:01,529 --> 01:25:03,156
Will you take a look at this.

1385
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:04,495
Huh? Huh?

1386
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:06,830
What do you think of your
old man now, Sport?

1387
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,803
10,000 smackaroos.

1388
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,871
No more paying with change.

1389
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:17,673
No more, no more spaghetti.

1390
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:19,475
Going to feel like steak.

1391
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,675
And you know those fancy
basketball sneakers

1392
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:23,707
with the, with the
buckles and the Velcro

1393
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:25,117
and the crap all over them?

1394
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:27,383
Their yours, buddy boy,
all yours.

1395
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:33,961
Hello?

1396
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:35,086
Murray.

1397
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,961
Hey, hey,
I take it all back.

1398
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,794
All agents
aren't useless.

1399
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:41,131
Oh, I'm kidding you,
I'm kidding you, man.

1400
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,770
You know I was always
in your corner.

1401
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,067
Oh, yeah, I knew
you'd come through.

1402
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:46,164
Well, Sport and I
are gonna do

1403
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,231
a little celebrating today...

1404
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:50,802
- Hey.
- Hey.

1405
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:53,177
Sold his book?

1406
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:54,977
Got a real job.

1407
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,108
Hey, Harriet, you
hear the good news?

1408
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,346
You're a writer.

1409
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,384
So how's it feel?

1410
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:03,721
Oh, big slice off heaven,

1411
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,589
side order of fries.

1412
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,219
Say, you hungry?

1413
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:09,059
I feel like going
to the fanciest,

1414
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:10,758
schmanciest
restaurant in town.

1415
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,027
We'll abuse the waiter.

1416
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,295
Who's with me? Harriet?

1417
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,528
She can't come.

1418
01:26:14,569 --> 01:26:16,161
What do you mean,
she can't come?

1419
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:17,501
You haven't even asked her.

1420
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,666
I said she can't come.

1421
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,138
You can't be my friend
if you're not my friend.

1422
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:34,917
I'm sorry, Sport.

1423
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,686
I'm sorry.

1424
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,094
No one will forgive me.

1425
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:53,471
Things will never be the same.

1426
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:12,386
I have nothing left to lose.

1427
01:27:14,863 --> 01:27:17,354
Someone told me
the only reason

1428
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,730
you guys play with me is
because of my mom's cake.

1429
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:22,635
Well, it is very good cake.

1430
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:29,738
Yeah, but how come we get
these pieces and you get those?

1431
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:31,746
We told you,
we're officers.

1432
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,304
And we need our strength.

1433
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:35,248
You get to fix the clubhouse.

1434
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:38,445
Somebody's dreaming.

1435
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,250
I am so bored.

1436
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,189
If you don't like it,
you can leave.

1437
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,283
Hey, you're right.

1438
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:50,590
Wait up.

1439
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,691
Anybody sick of
listening to her

1440
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,565
ought to get a life.

1441
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,472
Okay, but you can't come back!

1442
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:00,940
We're voting! It's official!

1443
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:30,397
Shh! Teacher!
There she is.

1444
01:28:31,773 --> 01:28:32,933
Good morning.

1445
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,339
Today, we are...

1446
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:36,309
Yes, Harriet?

1447
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:44,447
Miss Elson,
I've been thinking a lot,

1448
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:46,043
and you know how class president

1449
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:50,353
automatically gets to be editor
of the sixth grade newspaper?

1450
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:53,451
Yes.

1451
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:58,830
Well, I think...

1452
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:01,768
I think that it's
too much for one person

1453
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,567
and that it's not fair
to everybody

1454
01:29:04,606 --> 01:29:07,871
because everybody
deserves a chance.

1455
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:12,046
And...

1456
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:16,408
And we should change it.

1457
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:18,078
Objection!

1458
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:19,780
This isn't a courtroom, Marion.

1459
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,519
I like that idea, Harriet.

1460
01:29:24,559 --> 01:29:26,288
Let's see what the class thinks.

1461
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:27,919
Miss Elson, I think

1462
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:30,294
I speak for everyone when I say

1463
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:34,028
this is, this is a really,
really stupid idea.

1464
01:29:34,068 --> 01:29:35,695
That is one opinion.

1465
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:39,331
But let's take a vote.

1466
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:43,538
Marion is now editor
of the Guidepost.

1467
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:47,412
Would anyone like to nominate
another candidate?

1468
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:59,392
Well, I guess if no one
has anything to say...

1469
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:03,854
I have something to say.

1470
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:15,232
I think that Harriet's
a very good writer and...

1471
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:18,803
if we only listen
to one person's opinion

1472
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:21,542
we may never
get anywhere new.

1473
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:25,416
But Harriet might have
something very original

1474
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:28,251
and I'd like to read
what she has to write.

1475
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:36,295
Is there a second?

1476
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:38,765
I second it.

1477
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,297
I third it.

1478
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:51,475
Okay, then.

1479
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:55,346
Harriet Welsch is now
a candidate for editor.

1480
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:58,511
Who votes for Harriet?

1481
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:33,148
That... is that.

1482
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:35,519
Yes.

1483
01:31:58,746 --> 01:32:00,714
I am on a mission
to be a great writer.

1484
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,283
A good friend once told me

1485
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:07,810
that all great writers
try to see everything.

1486
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:10,790
Okay, here goes:

1487
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,760
I knew this guy once.

1488
01:32:13,795 --> 01:32:15,956
He used to be a bajillionaire.

1489
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:18,056
Now he rides a bike.

1490
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:20,727
Want to know the freaky part?

1491
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:25,403
He says the bike's better.

1492
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,000
Please write in
if you think he's lying.

1493
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:37,106
There's a difference
between looking at stuff

1494
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:39,449
and really seeing it.

1495
01:32:41,456 --> 01:32:43,083
Look who's here.

1496
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,751
Give them some bread, huh?

1497
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,623
Here you are.

1498
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:48,993
To really see,

1499
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:51,554
you've got to get a closer look.

1500
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:53,657
Why, thank you.

1501
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:54,668
So much.

1502
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:55,930
A cabbage.

1503
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,734
Carrots in here for you.

1504
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:00,263
And a sausage.

1505
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:16,957
I've noticed that, sometimes,

1506
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:19,926
stuff you think
is broken forever

1507
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:23,397
is actually totally fixable.

1508
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:29,767
But some stuff is supposed
to fall apart.

1509
01:33:29,804 --> 01:33:30,862
Speaking of which,

1510
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:33,703
certain high ranking officials
of a certain

1511
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:36,301
secret club had better
de-dorkify themselves

1512
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:37,971
in a hurry...

1513
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:40,577
or else everybody's going back

1514
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:42,981
to where they were
in the first place.

1515
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:44,985
This reporter believes

1516
01:33:45,052 --> 01:33:48,283
that de-dorkification
is a difficult,

1517
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:50,222
but not impossible, process.

1518
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:52,658
Mostly, you've got to want
to be cured.

1519
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:00,533
But I'm pretty sure
it's a two steps forward,

1520
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:03,594
one step back kind of deal.

1521
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,096
In theater news, Miss Elson's
sixth grade holiday pageant

1522
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:11,441
was the theatrical controversy
of the season.

1523
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,846
Some were happy to see it,

1524
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,873
and who am I to argue?

1525
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:36,165
Others say... it stunk.

1526
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:42,402
This reporter has no comment.

1527
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:44,343
And, hey, stupid school board,

1528
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:47,074
give Miss Elson a raise,
would you?

1529
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:50,879
She's not so bad,
as teachers go.

1530
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:53,614
And she puts up with a lot.

1531
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:57,347
There's evidence to suggest
that Janie Gibbs

1532
01:34:57,391 --> 01:35:00,292
will grow up to be
the world's greatest scientist.

1533
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:03,661
So far, she has shown amazing
progress in the areas

1534
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,792
of mold manipulation
and chemical combustibles.

1535
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,860
We have also learned
that Sport's father

1536
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:12,099
is rolling in dough
from his latest book,

1537
01:35:12,139 --> 01:35:14,607
which just goes to show,
if you stick to what you love...

1538
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:18,271
and work like a dog...
you will succeed.

1539
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,940
For those of you who don't know,
a retraction

1540
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:23,516
is when a newspaper
takes something back.

1541
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:27,146
This newspaper would like
to retract certain statements

1542
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:28,348
in a certain notebook

1543
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,789
which may have hurt
certain people's feelings.

1544
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:31,951
They were lies.

1545
01:35:31,993 --> 01:35:34,291
And those that weren't lies...

1546
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:35,955
were mean.

1547
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:39,160
Like, just because
a person's father is far away

1548
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,498
does not mean
he doesn't love you.

1549
01:35:41,535 --> 01:35:43,127
Anyway, don't think about it.

1550
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:47,905
The truth is important,

1551
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:51,400
but so are your friends.

1552
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:57,977
And if you can have them both,
then it's a good life.

1553
01:35:58,019 --> 01:36:03,753
Until next issue, I remain
your faithful correspondent,

1554
01:36:03,791 --> 01:36:10,526
Harriet M. Welsch.

1555
01:36:15,036 --> 01:36:16,867
Get up offa that thing

1556
01:36:16,904 --> 01:36:19,805
And dance till you feel better

1557
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,932
Get up offa that thing

1558
01:36:21,008 --> 01:36:23,374
And dance till you...
sing it now

1559
01:36:23,411 --> 01:36:25,436
Get up offa that thing

1560
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:27,504
And dance till you feel better

1561
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:29,778
Get up offa that thing

1562
01:36:29,817 --> 01:36:31,512
Just try to release
that pressure

1563
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:32,951
Get up offa that thing

1564
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:35,785
And shake till you feel better

1565
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:37,313
Get up offa that thing

1566
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:38,950
And shake... say it now

1567
01:36:38,993 --> 01:36:41,621
Get up offa that thing

1568
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:43,129
And shake till you feel better

1569
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:44,961
Get up offa that thing

1570
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:47,524
Try to release that pressure

1571
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:49,126
Get up off...

1572
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:50,967
Huh

1573
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:52,131
Good God

1574
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:53,936
So good

1575
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:56,710
Uhh

1576
01:36:56,744 --> 01:36:58,609
Everybody ready?

1577
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:03,146
Follow me

1578
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:05,744
Get up offa that thing

1579
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:08,084
And shake till you feel better

1580
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:09,555
Get up offa that thing

1581
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,080
And shake till you...
say it now

1582
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,559
Get up offa that thing

1583
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:16,062
And shake till you feel better

1584
01:37:16,097 --> 01:37:18,327
Get up offa that thing

1585
01:37:18,366 --> 01:37:20,095
Just try to release
that pressure

1586
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,692
Get up offa that thing

1587
01:37:21,736 --> 01:37:23,897
And shake till you feel better

1588
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:26,099
Get up offa that thing

1589
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:28,540
And shake till you...
sing it now

1590
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:30,908
Get up offa that thing

1591
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:32,503
And shake till you feel better

1592
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:34,707
Get up offa that thing

1593
01:37:34,749 --> 01:37:36,307
Ooh... so good

1594
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:43,950
Huh!

1595
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:45,389
Whoo-hoo!

1596
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,893
Get up offa that thing

1597
01:37:54,935 --> 01:37:55,902
Eew, a stink bomb!

1598
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:58,336
Get up offa that thing

1599
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,805
Get up offa that thing

1600
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:04,902
Dance till you feel better

1601
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:06,912
Get up offa that thing

1602
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:08,572
Just try to release
that pressure

1603
01:38:08,616 --> 01:38:09,776
Wait a minute

1604
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,213
Funky

1605
01:38:16,257 --> 01:38:18,919
I need it.

1606
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,448
A crack in the door

1607
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:47,751
A slit in the vines

1608
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:50,952
A hole in the fence

1609
01:38:50,992 --> 01:38:52,960
So easy to find

1610
01:38:52,994 --> 01:38:59,297
People doing people things

1611
01:38:59,334 --> 01:39:05,898
Whatever that might be

1612
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:12,744
They go on
about their business

1613
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:19,084
Too wrapped up to see

1614
01:39:19,121 --> 01:39:22,579
In the shadows

1615
01:39:22,624 --> 01:39:28,426
My unblinking eye

1616
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:33,958
I love...
the secretive life

1617
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:41,601
I hide in the park,
behind a bush

1618
01:39:41,643 --> 01:39:43,611
I see runners and skaters

1619
01:39:43,645 --> 01:39:48,275
And a half naked man
showing off his tattoos

1620
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:51,774
And I see old Mr. Gray
in his bad toupee

1621
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:54,948
With some dumb girl
about half his age

1622
01:39:54,990 --> 01:40:01,293
- People doing people things
- Definitely not his wife

1623
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:08,132
Are calling out to me

1624
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:14,302
All their grand
and foolish schemes

1625
01:40:14,342 --> 01:40:21,305
It's better than TV

1626
01:40:21,349 --> 01:40:30,656
They're so funny,
I could almost cry

1627
01:40:30,692 --> 01:40:36,995
I love...
the secretive life

1628
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:40,490
There's Johnny's dad
on his third martini

1629
01:40:40,535 --> 01:40:42,332
And his nose
is getting bigger

1630
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:45,828
As I watch him through
the kitchen window

1631
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:50,504
They really oughta
close those blinds

1632
01:40:50,545 --> 01:40:53,514
And under my coat,
I got a microrecorder

1633
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:57,006
A pad, and a pencil,
and a picture of you

1634
01:40:57,052 --> 01:41:00,351
I can't believe you did that

1635
01:41:00,388 --> 01:41:03,289
I see two love birds
walking by

1636
01:41:03,325 --> 01:41:06,624
With that sick and dreamy
