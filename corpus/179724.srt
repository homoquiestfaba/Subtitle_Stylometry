01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:10,600
Almost.

1019
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,414

1023
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:41,169
I have to make an offering to Yemanja
and ask her to undo the spell.

1024
01:16:41,242 --> 01:16:45,338
Isabella, Serafina told you the spell
is irreversible. It won't work.

1025
01:16:45,413 --> 01:16:49,349
It has to work. She will understand
and give me back my love.

1026
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:52,079
But-- Oh!

1027
01:16:53,354 --> 01:16:55,914

- I've lost it.
- Oh.

1031
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:10,235
Oh, girl, it's not
the prettiest thing I ever seen.

1032
01:17:10,304 --> 01:17:13,501
But, um, listen,
I'm sure it tastes--

1033
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:15,508
Try it.

1034
01:17:17,211 --> 01:17:19,372
Mmm.

1035
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:21,847

- Uh, no.

Honey, everybody has an off day.
It's fine.

1037

Look.
Everything is ruined!

1038
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:31,322
Okay. Listen. Calm down, okay?
We'll fix it.

1039
01:17:31,392 --> 01:17:36,227
We'll... use the souffle as a base,
pretty it up with this stuff.

1040
01:17:36,297 --> 01:17:38,788

the difference.

1043
01:17:47,775 --> 01:17:50,039
don't reject my offering.

1044
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,614

How did you know
I was here?

1049
01:19:47,595 --> 01:19:49,620
Monica told me.

1050
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:51,995
I came to say good-bye.

1051
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:58,296
I wish there was something
I could do.

1052
01:19:58,372 --> 01:20:01,739
There is. Why don't we cook
something before I go?

1053
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:05,108
- For old times' sake.
- I don't think I can cook anymore.

1054
01:20:05,179 --> 01:20:09,741
Neither can I. But together,
maybe we can find a way.

- Yes.
