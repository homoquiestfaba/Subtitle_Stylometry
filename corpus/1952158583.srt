00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,613
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

2
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,614
<i>A construction foreman in Griffith Park
heard the crash.</i>

3
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,847
Hey!

4
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,855
<i>He saw a cyclist cartwheel off his bike</i>

5
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,191
<i>and slam face-first into the unforgiving
asphalt of Riverside Drive.</i>

6
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,694
<i>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

7
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,665
<i>As we begin our descent
into Los Angeles,</i>

8
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:51,898
<i>we ask that you please be sure
that your seatbelts are fastened...</i>

9
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,702
<i>A 911 call brought out the troops
from Fire Station 76.</i>

10
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,977
- What happened?
- You had an accident.

11
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,842
- Do you know what happened?
- No shit, I had an accident. What?

12
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,385
<i>I don't remember any of this,
nor do I recall the cause of the spill.</i>

13
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,545
- Our batteries are off.
- I've been in here six hours now, and...

14
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,089
Listen to me. Wait a minute.
We're ready to go...

15
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,681
Hypochondriac.

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,288
OR 2.

17
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,289
<i>County-USC was
the closest emergency room,</i>

18
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,355
<i>and I quickly realized</i>

19
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,695
<i>that if you find yourself there</i>

20
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,067
<i>with nothing more than
a bump on the head,</i>

21
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,411
<i>you are one lucky Angeleno.</i>

22
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,249
Wow.

23
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,693
Ready.

24
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,363
<i>I'm not entirely comfortable with this.</i>

25
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,751
<i>Thank you.</i>

26
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,291
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

27
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,693
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

28
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,037
Okay.

29
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,142
Really?

30
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,418
<i>Doctors told me to expect
up to four weeks of disorientation.</i>

31
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,813
Christ. All right.

32
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,952
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.
I just want you to know, I just...</i>

33
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,257
<i>I'm not asking for sympathy.</i>

34
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,127
I just want you to understand
what's going on

35
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,689
<i>if I start writing about
what a bang-up job</i>

36
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,167
Governor Schwarzenegger's doing.

37
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,263
S- C-H-W-A-R-Z... Scratch that.

38
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,835
Passe. Lacks context.

39
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,654
<i>Right. So the question is...</i>

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,958
<i>Hey, Tommy.</i>

41
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,499
<i>Theoretically could I,
seeing as how the Governor has retired</i>

42
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,627
his position at the muscle magazine,
could I interview him?

43
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,868
<i>Right. And will my non- Teutonic lineage
be an issue?</i>

44
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:47,339
<i>See, no, that's... That's...
It gets to be funny. It's just an article.</i>

45
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,745
Do I need to have been on steroids
for a long time to even apply?

46
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,113
Good.

47
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,886
Gail, I like
the "attention must be paid" reference.

48
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,116
I might move it down a paragraph,
though.

49
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,092
<i>Thanks. I'm getting you a new desk.</i>

50
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,619
Good morning, gentlemen.

51
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,900
<i>- Thanks.
- Hey, guys. Check it out.</i>

52
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,164
I got a study here that says
the number of Americans under 35

53
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,639
who read a newspaper
is now down to 40%.

54
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,868
<i>- Forty?
- Forty.</i>

55
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,070
And the group we're losing mostly
are college-educated women.

56
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,635
- Pull my finger.
- Jesus Christ.

57
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,044
Hey, honey.

58
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,480
<i>"Welcome back, Steve. "
That would have been nice.</i>

59
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,915
<i>Thank you. You know, when Lopez
and I started out together...</i>

60
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,078
You had to walk 20 miles to school
in the snow with no shoes?

61
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,485
...people cared about
what went on in the world.

62
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,352
- Am I right, Steve? I mean, Christ.
- Back when people cared.

63
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,187
We're at war, and the only thing
that sells papers

64
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,624
is a Lindsay Lohan cooch shot.

65
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,093
Jesus, did someone
actually run that in print?

66
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,891
- I thought that was just on the Web.
- All right, all right.

67
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,226
- All I am saying is...
- I didn't see that.

68
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,562
...that if you run an excellent,
if I do say so myself,

69
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,866
front-page piece about how corporate
America is profiting from this war,

70
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,600
and the only reader response you get
is on two hands...

71
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,834
<i>- Meanwhile...
- That was a good piece, by the way.</i>

72
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,933
<i>- Fine. Thanks. You read it?
- I read that.</i>

73
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,910
<i>- Did you really?
- I didn't read it, but I loved it, Curt.</i>

74
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,743
Meanwhile, Lopez here
scrapes his forehead,

75
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,511
and gets, what,
I'm guessing about 75 e-mails

76
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,608
from readers worried about his safety?

77
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,882
<i>- I chased this piece.
- Then I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

78
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,118
<i>There is something
very wrong in this world.</i>

79
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,921
Newsflash, something wrong
with the world.

80
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,518
<i>Yeah.
Your face hurts my feelings, Steve.</i>

81
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,619
<i>That's harassment.</i>

82
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,357
- Mary?
- An environmental group studying...

83
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,490
- Please.
... chemical contaminants

84
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,658
- in people's bodies.
- I literally... No.

85
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,702
- Give some blood and write about it.
- Let me check my e-mails.

86
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,202
I think it would be a good idea for you.

87
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,863
I'm glad you feel that way. I just did that.

88
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,997
What do you think?

89
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,700
<i>The thought in my mind is,
"No, thank you. "</i>

90
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,369
It was funny.
People love it when you bleed.

91
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,605
- Readers.
- Busted.

92
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,169
What is that? What do you call that,
what you just did?

93
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,839
<i>- Transference.
- Freud.</i>

94
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,415
<i>Freud. Thank you. No.</i>

95
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,712
Sorry about the face.

96
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,345
- I hate needles.
- So use it.

97
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,221
<i>Originally used as a camp by settlers</i>

98
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,023
<i>outside of what was then
the village of Los Angeles,</i>

99
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,327
<i>it was called La Plaza Abaja,
or the Lower Plaza.</i>

100
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,455
Stevie Wonder fan?

101
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,359
<i>My Cherie Amour is the song of my life.</i>

102
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,452
<i>Signed, Sealed, Delivered.</i>

103
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,054
But you really shouldn't write
on a violin like that

104
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,565
because you have to treat a violin
like a child, you have to protect it.

105
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,761
You only got two strings.

106
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,098
All I want to do is play music,
and here's the problem

107
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,332
that I'm having right here.

108
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,501
<i>This one's gone, this one's gone,
this little one's out of commission.</i>

109
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,545
But you get that in
Cleveland public schools.

110
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,840
A lot of military statues in Cleveland.

111
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,643
- A very military-oriented city.
- Is that where you're from?

112
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,410
You're not gonna get musicians
on parade there.

113
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,078
<i>You got Severance Hall there.
You have The Music Settlement.</i>

114
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,142
Ohio State University.

115
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,554
<i>Whereas in Los Angeles, you have
Los Angeles PD, you have LA Times,</i>

116
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,057
you have Los Angeles Lakers.

117
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,924
<i>Those are armies, too.
Military regimentation, experimentation,</i>

118
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,327
Roman gable, Roman Catholicism,
Colonel Sanders,

119
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,490
- but this guy right here is...
- Colonel Sanders.

120
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,692
<i>...the quarterback with the orchestra.</i>

121
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,530
Now the cello could back this guy
with the same moves,

122
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,933
<i>but the cello can't be concert master.</i>

123
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,564
No. He leads out, this was
Itzhak Perlman, Jascha Heifetz.

124
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,471
You can't play music
in the winter in Cleveland

125
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,531
because of the ice and the snow.

126
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,601
<i>That's why I prefer Los Angeles
to Beethoven City,</i>

127
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,271
because it never rains
in Southern California,

128
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,542
and if it does, all I have to do
is just go in the tunnel,

129
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,947
<i>I could play to my heart's content.</i>

130
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,783
I'm flabbergasted about the statue.
Aren't you flabbergasted about this?

131
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,923
- Anyway, nice to meet you.
- Do you have any idea how it got here?

132
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,186
- No.
- Maybe they dropped it off late at night.

133
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,354
'Cause it's just astonishing to sit here
for hours and just... Just gaze at it.

134
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,125
- It... It just blows me away.
- No idea.

135
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,460
It really blows me away

136
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,594
that someone as great as Beethoven
was the leader of Los Angeles.

137
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,368
Yeah.

138
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,572
<i>I'm Steve Lopez, LA Times.</i>

139
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,113
- Lopez, L-O-P-E-Z?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,843
<i>Lopez, Los Angeles Times. Mr. Lopez.</i>

141
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,145
- What's your name?
- Lopez.

142
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,651
Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior.

143
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,086
<i>N- A- T-H- A-N-I-E-L A-N- T-H- O-N-Y</i>

144
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,089
A- Y-E-R-S J-U-N-I-O-R.

145
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,153
Or J-R-period.

146
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,426
I apologize for my appearance.
I've had a few setbacks.

147
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,769
Me, too.

148
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,142
Who are Nancy, Paul, and Craig?

149
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,976
<i>Those were my classmates at Juilliard.</i>

150
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,948
<i>Good afternoon, Juilliard School.</i>

151
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,112
Registrar's office, please.

152
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,892
What's up?

153
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,395
It's highly classified. I can't tell you.

154
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,264
- How many?
- More than we can afford to lose.

155
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,997
Evidently, it goes like this.

156
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,130
<i>Stock price sinks, we lose reporters.</i>

157
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,003
<i>Stock price sinks more,
we lose more reporters.</i>

158
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,235
<i>That won't produce more or less...</i>

159
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,641
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez from
the LA Times. I'm calling to enquire</i>

160
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,613
as to whether a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
attended your school.

161
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,616
A- Y-E-R-S. I'm sorry.

162
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,019
Freaking child lock.

163
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,355
- How is our son, by the way?
- He's good.

164
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,224
He likes his classes.
He likes his pre-gay roommate.

165
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,626
You should call him.

166
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,028
- I call him.
- Is a lie.

167
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,656
I call him. He doesn't call me back.

168
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,030
- He calls me back.
- Mary...

169
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,467
- Just try again.
- Yes, Mary.

170
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,595
- Yes, Mary.
- Yes. Yes, Steve.

171
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,502
- I gotta take this call.
- Great.

172
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,837
- Because I don't have a story. Hello?
- Call him.

173
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,536
<i>I'm sorry, we have no record</i>

174
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,135
<i>of a Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
ever attending Juilliard.</i>

175
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,578
Really?

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,150
But then I don't have a story.

177
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,786
<i>Thanks for checking.</i>

178
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,388
I'm not doing the blood thing.

179
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,694
I got too many other good ideas.

180
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,301
My dad is gonna freak
when he finds out I met you.

181
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,308
He loves your column.

182
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,003
What about you?

183
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,440
- Well, I don't really read the newspaper.
- Sure.

184
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,542
But when I do...

185
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,986
<i>Hey! Those aren't all for me, are they?</i>

186
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,425
I'm also going to need a clump of hair
and some urine.

187
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,019
<i>That's easy.</i>

188
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,694
- All right.
- Okay.

189
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,191
Make a fist for me.

190
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,638
Come on.

191
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,243
Crap.

192
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,951
<i>- Lopez.
- Mr. Lopez?</i>

193
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,420
Yeah, can you just hold on one second?

194
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,184
I'm having a little
technical difficulty here.

195
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,386
<i>This is Rosie Delgado
from the Juilliard School.</i>

196
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,952
<i>Mr. Lopez?</i>

197
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,827
Yes. Please continue.

198
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,926
<i>After we spoke yesterday, I realized
I only checked our graduates.</i>

199
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,699
<i>So I looked in our matriculates,
and there he was.</i>

200
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,208
<i>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers
enrolled in 1970</i>

201
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,734
<i>and he dropped out toward the end
of his second year.</i>

202
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,871
<i>Thank you.</i>

203
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:40,683
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.
Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.</i>

204
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,244
<i>He stepped back... He backed away.</i>

205
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,791
<i>He... Nathaniel is... Is what?</i>

206
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,455
<i>Nathaniel is...
A great column is what Nathaniel is.</i>

207
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,328
<i>Nathaniel is missing.</i>

208
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,921
Son of a bitch.

209
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,119
- Raccoons.
- Oh, yeah?

210
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,458
<i>- That's the culprit.
- Oh, boy.</i>

211
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,830
<i>What are they doing?
They eat the grass?</i>

212
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,628
No, they eat the worms in the grass.

213
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,998
<i>They eat the worms in the grass?</i>

214
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,537
Yeah, we had them.
It's a God-awful mess.

215
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,630
- Wanna know how I got rid of them?
- Yes.

216
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,402
Coyote urine.

217
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,434
- Wow. Coyote urine?
- Seriously. In powdered form.

218
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,810
- Remarkable.
- It's a whole industry, you know.

219
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,906
Funny.

220
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,451
- Hey, I'm Neil, by the way.
- Okay.

221
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:01,760
<i>Anxiety, restlessness, euphoria.
If you're experiencing...</i>

222
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,954
<i>I would spend every night tossing
and turning...</i>

223
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,159
<i>Wow. Okay, and what is the proper
method of application?</i>

224
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,428
<i>Should I sprinkle it in the yard?</i>

225
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,335
<i>First, you wanna dilute
the urine powder in water.</i>

226
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,670
<i>- Wait, I want to?
- Well, maybe I should say "have to. "</i>

227
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:21,042
<i>And then you're gonna have to hang
the liquid from trees in plastic bags.</i>

228
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,479
<i>So, people are doing this
all over Southern California?</i>

229
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,609
<i>Oh, yes, sir.
Last month, I sold some to Paula Abdul.</i>

230
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,849
But no Simon Cowell?
'Cause that would be exciting. Figure?

231
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,060
I'm gonna call you back a little later.

232
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,470
Hey.

233
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,476
Hey, Nathaniel.

234
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,075
Remember me?

235
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,482
Sorry.

236
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,154
Maybe have a minute when you're done?

237
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,932
Let me know.

238
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,797
I just saw you, so I...

239
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,596
Nothing.

240
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,010
<i>Mr. Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times,
Los Angeles, California.</i>

241
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,414
Hey, Nathaniel.

242
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,610
I've been searching for Mr. Beethoven,

243
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:07,709
but he's slipping away like a dream.

244
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,947
I'm trying to get back into shape,
but I don't have any sheet music.

245
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,354
<i>Beethoven's String Quartet,
Opus 59, Number 1,</i>

246
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,688
<i>Violin Concerto, Opus 61 in D,</i>

247
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,354
<i>Fifth Concerto, Opus 73 in E Flat,
red car, green car,</i>

248
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,489
there goes a police car, and God is right
on the other side of that wall.

249
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,160
I had to dig a hole
to bury some human defecation.

250
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,293
But they didn't have
the human decency...

251
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,393
I was looking for you.

252
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,371
...to use the proper facilities.
- I noticed that you've moved.

253
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,134
Well, it's beautiful here,
because you can play music

254
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,903
and have pigeons clapping
as they take off,

255
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,807
<i>and right there
is The Los Angeles Times Building.</i>

256
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,812
- Right, that's where I work.
- Mr. Steve Lopez, staff writer.

257
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,869
New York, Cleveland, it doesn't matter.

258
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,972
All I have to do is
look up at that building

259
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,038
and I know exactly where I am.

260
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,141
I was thinking about...

261
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,412
I'm in Los Angeles,
Los Angeles, California,

262
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,544
- Los Angeles Lakers.
... writing about you

263
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,609
for the paper.

264
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,814
<i>Magic Johnson,
Magic Johnson Theaters.</i>

265
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,323
Magic Johnson is a basketball player,
but he's also a big, black man.

266
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,484
What if I were to wanna write a story
about you for the newspaper?

267
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,892
<i>Los Angeles Times,
Los Angeles newspaper.</i>

268
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,955
- Staff writer, Mr. Steve Lopez.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

269
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,968
Do you mind if I record this?
And I wanna write a story about you.

270
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,129
A column about how a guy like you
winds up on the street.

271
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,399
- What do you think of that?
- Mr. Lopez needs to do

272
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:02,599
what Mr. Lopez needs to do.

273
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,733
No one could ever stop Mr. Lopez
from doing what he wants to do.

274
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,937
Are you flying that plane?

275
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,614
No. No, I'm right here.

276
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,040
I don't know how God works.

277
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,143
I called Juilliard, and they said
you went there, but you didn't finish.

278
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,154
I bombed right out of there.
I bombed out of Juilliard.

279
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,849
- Yeah, what happened?
- I just... It didn't happen.

280
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,893
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

281
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,951
Anyone I could contact? Family?

282
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,259
Family? Miss Floria Ayers, my mom.

283
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,925
<i>She's a beautician.
Beauty is art. Music is beauty.</i>

284
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,969
I don't do hair. I do my own hair,

285
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,561
but obviously, my mom does
everybody's hair in the community.

286
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,166
<i>They would come for her.
She's quite a woman.</i>

287
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,234
But I don't know how you're gonna talk
to her, though, because she passed.

288
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,507
Okay. Sorry to hear that.

289
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,973
Who could I call?

290
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,747
226-962-6746.

291
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,113
Whose number's that?

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,057
You know,
it's a dream out here, Mr. Lopez.

293
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,287
<i>The sun is shining.
The nights are cool and serene,</i>

294
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,298
and I notice that everyone is smiling.

295
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,262
<i>- Delivered just hours before...
- Americans are asking...</i>

296
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,031
Hi, I'm calling for Jennifer Ayers-Moore.

297
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,333
<i>How will we finally win this war?</i>

298
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,395
<i>Hello?</i>

299
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,202
<i>Hi, this is Steve Lopez
from the LA Times.</i>

300
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,336
<i>I spoke with your aunt, I believe, earlier.
She suggested I give you a call.</i>

301
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>- About what?
- About your brother, Nathaniel.</i>

302
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,379
Is he dead?

303
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,615
What? No, no, no, he's alive.

304
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,019
<i>Is he all right?</i>

305
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:33,129
He's... Yeah. He's homeless.
I don't know if you're aware of that.

306
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,826
But he seems very bright, and...
May I record this?

307
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,732
And talented, obviously.
Juilliard and all.

308
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,129
I'm, I'm... I'm sorry.

309
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,536
<i>- Your name again, please?
- Steve Lopez.</i>

310
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,363
Mr. Lopez, why are you calling?

311
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:46,900
<i>I'm gonna write
a column about Nathaniel.</i>

312
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,105
Why?

313
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:55,210
Because that's what I do. Everyone has
a story, and it's interesting,

314
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,450
<i>you know, that a Juilliard alum
is now homeless.</i>

315
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,757
<i>But he seems smart
and kind, and... And...</i>

316
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,926
And spends his days filling the city air
with violin music, and I just...

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,991
He plays the violin now?

318
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:15,505
He's... Yeah. Why?
He used to play something else?

319
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,070
Bye, Mama.

320
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:41,054
- Good morning, Nathaniel.
- Morning, Miss Little John.

321
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,699
So, what do you want to play for me?

322
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,111
I'm going to play some Beethoven, sir.
I'm crazy about Beethoven.

323
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,206
<i>He was younger than me
when he started playing piano,</i>

324
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,047
and I wanted to play the piano,
but so many kids played it,

325
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,088
and there's only one at school,
so it's hard to get practice time in.

326
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:08,456
So, I chose the cello. Hardly anyone
at school wanted to play the cello.

327
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,189
And Beethoven was composing
when he was only 22,

328
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,753
and I'm already older than that,

329
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,197
so I figure I got a lot of
catching up to do.

330
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,132
Let's hear you play.

331
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,996
<i>He had the talent, that's for sure.
I called his mother that night.</i>

332
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,336
<i>I told her that I thought he was
the most gifted kid I've ever met.</i>

333
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,667
<i>I said that if he made
a full commitment to music,</i>

334
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:06,514
<i>if he really, really gave it all he had,
the whole world would open up to him.</i>

335
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,448
<i>And he did. He really did.</i>

336
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,820
<i>Go see if Martha's rollers are ready.
They should be on the kitchen table.</i>

337
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,358
Okay, Mama.

338
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,556
Miss Florence, I'll be back in 20.

339
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,099
He ain't gonna get no sleep.

340
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,635
He gonna kill that little girl
before he kills everybody...

341
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,003
$20,000! I told him he gotta buy me
something real pretty. Real pretty.

342
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,693
<i>Before long, it got so that was all he did.</i>

343
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,891
<i>No more football, no more baseball.
Just music.</i>

344
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,794
<i>Day in and day out.</i>

345
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,474
<i>The whole world
was changing around him.</i>

346
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,038
<i>And that was all he did.</i>

347
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,439
<i>Music.</i>

348
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,763
Hey, you awake?

349
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,530
You know what I hear
when you play your music?

350
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,506
I hear the voice of God coming...

351
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,470
I'm serious.

352
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,111
You got something special here, baby.

353
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,554
A way out.

354
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,120
<i>There is a whole world waiting for you.</i>

355
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,865
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

356
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,566
<i>Nathaniel was shy in our first encounter.
Period.</i>

357
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,475
<i>He took a step back
when I approached him to say</i>

358
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,070
<i>I liked the way his violin music</i>

359
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,879
<i>drowned out the jackhammers
on Grand Street. Period.</i>

360
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,279
<i>Nathaniel's first instrument
was the cello.</i>

361
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,553
<i>Strangely, he has never had
any training on the violin instrument.</i>

362
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,355
<i>He has never had... Period.</i>

363
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,022
<i>He has never had
any training on the violin.</i>

364
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,861
<i>He switched to the latter
after winding up on the streets.</i>

365
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:26,032
<i>One day, I asked him
about his hopes and dreams.</i>

366
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,165
<i>"That's easy," he said.
"I'd like to get these other two strings. "</i>

367
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,912
<i>Dear Mr. Lopez,</i>

368
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,575
<i>this morning I read your article
about the street musician</i>

369
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,482
<i>and was deeply moved.</i>

370
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,048
<i>This cello is one I used for 50 years,</i>

371
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,853
<i>until arthritis got the better of me.</i>

372
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,322
<i>Please pass it along to Mr. Ayers</i>

373
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,627
<i>with my prayers
for his health and safety.</i>

374
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,749
- Nathaniel!
- All I'm trying to do

375
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,114
is work as hard as I can
to clean up the tunnel.

376
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,244
- Hey! Nathaniel!
- But they don't want me to help them.

377
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,447
I won't have it, you know.

378
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,615
- Don't want to have this degradation...
- Are you out of your mind?

379
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,022
...because they just won't respect
that Beethoven...

380
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,218
What are you doing?

381
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,557
...and I try to tell every one of them,
I won't have this nastiness...

382
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,860
- Nathaniel!
... this degradation, I won't have it.

383
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,027
Don't!

384
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,598
Don't! Don't!

385
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,067
<i>I'm not going to have this nastiness
in this tunnel. This degradation.</i>

386
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,203
Good.

387
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,544
Remember when I said
I was gonna write about you?

388
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,414
Well, I did.

389
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,353
When people heard that you were
just playing with two strings,

390
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,517
some of them thought you might want
something better to work with.

391
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,493
No. I can't cover that.

392
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,154
You don't have to pay for it. It's a gift.

393
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,198
- I'm sure it's a very beautiful instrument.
- Free and clear.

394
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,325
People are very, very generous.

395
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,561
But, look, here's the deal.

396
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,230
It's not safe for you to have something
this valuable on the streets...

397
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,567
You don't have to worry
about that, Mr. Lopez.

398
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,005
I've been mugged 24 times.

399
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,735
I will fight to the death
to protect this instrument.

400
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,300
Right, that's my point exactly.

401
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,572
So, apparently there's a place

402
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,477
that's a couple of blocks down
that's called Lamp.

403
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,038
- I can't go... No, I can't go there.
- And I... Hold on.

404
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,140
I can't go... No, I can't go there.

405
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,206
<i>- They smoke cigarettes.
- I talked to the guy.</i>

406
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,446
<i>- He says you can keep it there.
- They drop the butts on the ground.</i>

407
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,579
<i>They do it to torment me. They just...
They do it to torment me.</i>

408
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,420
<i>That's the deal. You wanna play this,
you gotta do it there.</i>

409
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,790
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yeah.

410
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,395
<i>Except for this one time. Take it out
and give it a test drive or whatever.</i>

411
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,531
- So I can play it here?
- For a couple minutes,

412
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,234
and then we're gonna bring it to Lamp.

413
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,455
Laying in there like a pig in a blanket.

414
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,595
Only... Only the greats.
Really, only the greats.

415
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,157
Yo-Yo Ma, Jacqueline du Pre,

416
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,130
and the coolest cucumber of them all is

417
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,605
Janos Starker.

418
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:21,473
Gotta put rosin on your bow.
It's just like feeding a parakeet.

419
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,277
A bow needs rosin
just like a police car needs prisoners.

420
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,936
So pack it up. We'll bring it to Lamp,
you can get back at it.

421
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,600
I haven't really gotten a chance
to know her yet.

422
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,406
- So...
- I'm not saying you can't play.

423
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,504
<i>- You can. Just not here.
- This is the perfect music environment</i>

424
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,639
<i>- for playing music.
- This?</i>

425
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,909
- No.
- Yes.

426
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,416
<i>This is a sidewalk, okay?</i>

427
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:23,113
<i>- That's the deal. We made a deal.
- No, no, no. You'll break the bridge.</i>

428
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,815
<i>- You'll put water in it, you'll drown her.
- That's what I'll do?</i>

429
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,879
- It will be ruined.
- Why would I damage it?

430
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,482
- I gave you the damn thing.
- It won't play right ever,

431
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,288
- because, Mr. Lopez, you'll ruin it.
- I'm not going to...

432
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,419
I'm not gonna see you
get killed over this.

433
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,487
You don't know what you're doing.
Let me put it away myself.

434
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,259
<i>Then put it away.</i>

435
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,460
<i>Thank you.</i>

436
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,968
<i>Because when you start
a relationship with somebody...</i>

437
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,871
- Don't make a big deal of it, okay?
- It is a big deal.

438
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,637
In a minute,
you'll have it set up down at Lamp

439
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,474
and be playing like you never stopped.

440
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,638
- Right?
- It's brand-new, this relationship.

441
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,739
- I don't want this relationship to end.
- Do you know where it is?

442
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,943
- No, I can't do that.
- Just leave that there. I'll drive you.

443
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:55,178
<i>I have my cart there.
I could get it in my cart.</i>

444
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,311
What are you doing?
You're gonna let go.

445
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,445
- Just let your fingers go.
- Does anyone...

446
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,546
Does anyone see
what he's doing right here?

447
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,217
- He's stealing it.
- I'II... I'll meet you there.

448
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,953
San Julian and 6th.

449
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,392
All right?

450
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:08,394
- I'll drive. You walk.
- I know where it is...

451
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,400
See you in a half hour?

452
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,187
For cash money
I got speed, man.

453
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,551
I'm good.

454
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,828
Jesus.

455
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,630
Fine.

456
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,501
<i>Tennis shoes.</i>

457
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,840
Oh, boy.

458
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,123
One at a time. One at a time.

459
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,500
<i>The pusher. Ten cents.</i>

460
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,009
- Say, hey, is David here?
- Yes?

461
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,707
I'm here for David.

462
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:32,043
- Who?
- David.

463
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,084
David? I can go get him.

464
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,515
<i>Thanks.</i>

465
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,956
David!

466
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,117
Hey.

467
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,932
- Hi.
- Hi. You a volunteer?

468
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,065
<i>Steve Lopez, Los Angeles Times.</i>

469
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,609
<i>- Don't be scared. Come in.
- Thanks.</i>

470
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,611
Every staff has a key,

471
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,547
so if he does come by and I'm not here,
then anybody can get it for him.

472
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,981
- Well, he'll be here.
- Okay.

473
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,040
He said he was coming.

474
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,847
Can you sign in for me?

475
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,547
<i>- Sure.
- Thanks.</i>

476
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,489
- Afternoon.
- Hi. How are you?

477
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,994
I mean, it's tired.
It's like they can't find the medication

478
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,497
that's right for me, you know?

479
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,430
- You know what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

480
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,095
When they put me on lithium,

481
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,037
<i>it was like a portion of my brain</i>

482
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,131
was fully functional.

483
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,673
You know what I mean?

484
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,378
Because it's like when I take
the lithium and everything,

485
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,848
it totally eliminates
the voices in my mind

486
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,714
<i>when they first start rising up,</i>

487
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,380
you know, and it stops them, right there.

488
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,423
I don't like that,
because they just stop them.

489
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,755
<i>Because, see, sometimes
those voices comfort me.</i>

490
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,593
<i>And when they comfort me,
if they give me all this lithium,</i>

491
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,292
<i>then I no longer have the voices
to comfort me.</i>

492
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,698
You understand what I'm saying?

493
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,201
Do you feel what I'm saying to you?

494
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,972
- You mind if I sit here?
- Not at all.

495
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,068
All right.

496
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,136
- I'm Steve.
- I'm Steve, too.

497
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:11,511
Oh, boy. Hi.

498
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,881
- I knew I picked the right spot.
- Yeah, you're good.

499
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,346
So are you a new Lamp staff, or...

500
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:24,156
- No. I'm just waiting for somebody.
- Okay.

501
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,457
I just try to keep Leeann happy.

502
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,129
He is a bright spot in my life.
We value the same things.

503
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,638
<i>And we're comfortable together.</i>

504
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,165
<i>Thank you, Leeann.
That's so nice to hear you say that.</i>

505
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,137
I call him Piggy Boy and stuff like that,

506
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,876
but I shouldn't,
because he's in a bad shape.

507
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,077
We thought his problem was cocaine.

508
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,177
- But it was pancreatic cancer.
- Yeah?

509
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:53,587
KK's French, Egyptian,
and African-American,

510
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,454
<i>and I am a quarter French.</i>

511
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,926
<i>I know about disease.
I know how to treat it.</i>

512
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,793
Now I understand people.
I can help so many people fast,

513
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,923
<i>and I can comfort them.</i>

514
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,366
<i>They've got Italian nurses, 6'4",
in the county hospital.</i>

515
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,495
And one of them talked to me
like I was trash.

516
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,735
Now, this is probably that the hour
of power that the Bible speaks of,

517
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,801
somebody who speaks a harsh
language, will have what the computer...

518
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,210
<i>The computer is probably the beast.</i>

519
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,180
My aunt ended up with
26 shock treatments

520
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,375
because she didn't want to go to bed

521
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,678
with her sex-crazed husband.

522
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,276
He was paying call girls $200 apiece,

523
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,616
going to bed with them
and coming home

524
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,315
and giving my aunt all kinds of diseases.

525
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,415
I got sick. I was working over there.

526
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,893
And I got sicker than a dog one day.
I got an infection in my esophagus.

527
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,159
<i>The neighbor's dog was sick one day
and the only thing I had on hand</i>

528
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,996
was a packet of tetracycline
for my chickens.

529
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,595
<i>So they wouldn't... They were too busy
to treat her at the moment.</i>

530
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,105
<i>- You're fantastic.
- They'd already given her...</i>

531
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,816
Ice cold. Ice cold.

532
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,252
<i>"Points West" by Steve Lopez.</i>

533
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,520
<i>I put Nathaniel's new instruments
in safekeeping and waited.</i>

534
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,863
<i>Fifteen minutes.
Thirty minutes. An hour.</i>

535
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,968
<i>Too long, in fact,
'cause guess what, schmuck,</i>

536
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,940
<i>you got a deadline tomorrow.</i>

537
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,677
<i>And the story of a guy not showing up</i>

538
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,407
<i>is not a story.</i>

539
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,774
<i>Nathaniel. Nathaniel. Nathaniel.</i>

540
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,900
Okay.

541
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,828
So, you guys are basically united
by non-belief.

542
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,428
<i>- That's right.
- Yeah.</i>

543
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,466
So, do you non-gather?

544
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,725
And non-worship?

545
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,667
We tried, but...

546
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,304
- Not a lot to talk about.
- Yeah.

547
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,004
- Now we have a website.
- Swell.

548
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,513
Anything else you don't believe in?

549
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,074
- Sorry.
- Yeah, actually...

550
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:36,847
- Sorry.
- Okay.

551
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,116
<i>- Lopez.
- Can you hear this?</i>

552
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,315
Sorry, can't hear you.

553
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,552
<i>I said, can you hear this?</i>

554
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,567
<i>This family thinks it can have
this conversation at every step.</i>

555
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,693
<i>This is my apartment.
This is my apartment.</i>

556
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,930
<i>This is my apartment.</i>

557
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,803
<i>Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Junior.
N- A- T-H- A...</i>

558
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,370
- I need Charles for the practice.
... because you're so good.

559
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,534
I am so good, but I still have
to tweak things so I can win.

560
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,040
<i>There's a fine line in performances.</i>

561
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,547
- I mean, I can't let her beat me.
- I really have to practice.

562
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,278
Half an hour is all it takes for me.

563
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,875
Half an hour.

564
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,383
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

565
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,556
<i>- Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel.</i>

566
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,926
<i>- Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel?</i>

567
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,988
<i>- Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel.</i>

568
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:06,333
<i>- Nathaniel Ayers.

569
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,428
<i>- Nathaniel. Nathaniel.
- Nathaniel.</i>

570
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:09,830
<i>- Ayers!
- Nathaniel!</i>

571
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,738
Ma, I'm good, honestly, it's just that...

572
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,942
<i>- I'm real proud of you, baby.
- Thank you.</i>

573
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:21,280
It's just that I'm not always so sure
I know what's going on, and...

574
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,744
<i>You are gonna be fine.</i>

575
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,083
It's so frightening, and...

576
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,648
<i>And I'm having trouble
differentiating certain things.</i>

577
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,218
<i>Keeping things separated.</i>

578
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,894
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

579
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,092
<i>If you need help...</i>

580
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,865
<i>- That's where your pain is stored.
- Nathaniel.</i>

581
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,443
<i>- Nathaniel. Nathaniel.
- Paint your chest white.</i>

582
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,244
<i>Protect her from the pain.</i>

583
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,441
<i>Nathaniel.</i>

584
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,009
<i>I'll be here to protect you from the pain.</i>

585
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,612
<i>- I'll protect you from the pain.
- I'll protect you from the pain.</i>

586
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:01,190
<i>I'll protect you from the pain.</i>

587
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,091
<i>I'll protect you from their eyes and ears.</i>

588
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,753
Nathaniel.

589
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,457
Are you finding this piece to be
beyond your abilities?

590
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,523
<i>They're listening to you, Nathaniel.</i>

591
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,694
<i>They can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.</i>

592
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,830
<i>- I can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.
- Well, then I suggest you do better.</i>

593
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,067
<i>They can hear your thoughts, Nathaniel.</i>

594
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,076
<i>- Don't think, Nathaniel.
- Bar 279, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

595
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,412
<i>- Run away, Nathaniel.
- Run away, Nathaniel.</i>

596
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,252
<i>Run away, Nathaniel.</i>

597
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,554
<i>- Come on. Run.
- You should run.</i>

598
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,322
<i>- You'll have to hide, Nathaniel.
- Run!</i>

599
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,829
<i>- You'll never get out of there.
- You'll never get out of there.</i>

600
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,628
<i>- Run! Run! Run!
- You'll never get out.</i>

601
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,066
<i>- Quick, like a jackrabbit.
- Nathaniel.</i>

602
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,104
<i>They're white, heartless, aren't they?</i>

603
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,366
<i>- Heartless.
- Hide.</i>

604
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,736
<i>Hide for me here, Nathaniel.</i>

605
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,275
<i>We see you, Nathaniel.</i>

606
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,140
<i>- They'll see you, Nathaniel.
- Whiteness.</i>

607
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,645
<i>- There's no hiding, Nathaniel.
- Whiteness.</i>

608
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,241
<i>You'll never hide well enough.</i>

609
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,475
<i>...turn you white...
- Whiteness!</i>

610
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,643
<i>- No hiding for you, Nathaniel.
- Whiteness. Whiteness.</i>

611
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,242
<i>Whiteness.</i>

612
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,479
You'll take it,
because I want my out.

613
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,544
Detroit? Anger management.

614
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,146
It's amazing, right?

615
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,691
Does it look like
I need some anger management to you?

616
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,453
Yeah. Man, I'll take him any day.

617
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,722
He quiets everybody down.

618
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:49,061
- What does he have, schizophrenia?
- I don't know.

619
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,432
Well, we should hook him up with
psychiatric services and find out, right?

620
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,405
Yeah, I don't get
too hung up on diagnosis.

621
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,876
What do you mean?

622
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:00,932
What do I mean?

623
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:05,038
But how do you help somebody
if you don't know what they have?

624
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,244
Look at these people.

625
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,218
Every one of them's been diagnosed
more than you can imagine.

626
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,482
And as far as I can tell,
it hasn't done them any good.

627
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,089
But he needs medication, right?

628
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,786
I'll tell you one thing he doesn't need.

629
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:21,024
One more person telling him
he needs medication.

630
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,726
Son of a bitch.

631
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,533
- Where'd he go?
- Who?

632
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,904
- Nathaniel.
- Don't ask me, dude.

633
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,374
<i>- Thanks, Steve.
- You're welcome, Steve.</i>

634
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,678
<i>- Keep walking. Keep walking!
- There's a cop over there.</i>

635
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,450
- He'll shoot a nigga with a pop.
- You got that cheese, huh?

636
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,390
- You're right about that cheese.
- Hold on, hold on. Hold up.

637
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,759
Hey, wait!

638
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,364
Want to buy some candy?

639
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,121
Five-o. Five-o.

640
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,789
No way this is gonna be...

641
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,393
<i>That boy's not the real police.</i>

642
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,733
Oh, man.
Hell, man. Where's my piece at, nigga?

643
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,579
Back up.

644
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,278
I went over to the library.

645
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,652
I thought I might pick up
some sheet music.

646
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,782
<i>Sonata Number 1, F Major, Opus 5,</i>

647
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,827
<i>Sonata Number 2 in A Major,
Opus 69 for String Quartet.</i>

648
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,226
What happened?
Somebody get beat up?

649
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,354
Overdose, I think.

650
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,063
<i>The other night, someone...
There was a beating over here.</i>

651
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,261
Someone got bones rearranged
in their face. It was just crazy.

652
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:17,204
I don't understand why anybody
would do something like that.

653
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,572
<i>- This where you sleep?
- I used to sleep on Wall Street,</i>

654
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,474
<i>but it's too dirty.</i>

655
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,058
You know, Mr. Lopez, my vision...

656
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,656
I hate to admit it, but I'm gonna have
to be like Beethoven.

657
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:47,863
<i>Just do what he did and just die.
Thank you, Mr. Lopez.</i>

658
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,429
My vision is not far-off stuff,

659
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,941
just basically getting
across the street safely.

660
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,499
Honor thy father and mother,
and then, hopefully,

661
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,411
the music will take care of itself.

662
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,778
<i>That's really all you can do.</i>

663
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,214
I mean, when you think about it,

664
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,444
there's not much that
you can do other than that.

665
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,249
- Would you care for a drink?
- I'm fine.

666
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,390
<i>Thanks.</i>

667
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,760
Gotta tuck this guy in here,
nice and safe.

668
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,431
Put that down there.
Make sure this corner...

669
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,627
You can rest on this.

670
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,538
Do you think of writers often, Mr. Lopez?

671
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:31,138
Do you think of writers
the way I think about musicians?

672
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,618
I write for a living,

673
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,781
and it's not like it used to be.

674
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,922
I love thinking about musicians.

675
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,624
<i>I imagine Beethoven and Mozart
in that window where the light is,</i>

676
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,690
and they just hunger and they thirst
like we do.

677
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,593
It's angelic.

678
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,137
I believe these children of God are
gonna be okay tonight.

679
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,144
<i>They're gonna sleep and dream
as humans do.</i>

680
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,337
Our Father,

681
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,637
<i>who art in Heaven,</i>

682
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,577
hallowed be thy name.

683
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,612
<i>Thy kingdom come,</i>

684
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,420
<i>thy will be done,</i>

685
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,758
<i>on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

686
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:05,006
<i>Give us this day our daily bread...</i>

687
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,667
<i>Just keep it coming. There's plenty.</i>

688
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,907
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

689
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:14,007
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

690
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,220
<i>I knew only part of his story.</i>

691
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:24,522
<i>I knew him playing the violin
on a dairy crate in the morning sun,</i>

692
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,997
<i>suspended somewhere between
boy genius and lost traveler.</i>

693
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,862
<i>Every night, my friend Nathaniel tucks
his instruments away</i>

694
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,269
<i>and lays his head
among the predators and hustlers,</i>

695
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,365
<i>among fallen drunks
sprawled in the streets,</i>

696
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:44,277
<i>as rats the size of meatloaves dart
out of the drains to feed off the squalor.</i>

697
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:54,321
<i>...lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.</i>

698
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,384
<i>For thine is the kingdom,</i>

699
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,662
<i>the power and the glory,</i>

700
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,759
forever.

701
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,565
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

702
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,509
<i>I tell him this is no place for him.
He says he wants to be here.</i>

703
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,308
<i>He says this is his choice.</i>

704
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:22,317
<i>Should I take him at his word,
or should I try to force him inside?</i>

705
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,479
<i>Wouldn't a little arm-twisting be
more humane</i>

706
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,079
<i>than leaving him here on the streets</i>

707
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:31,116
<i>in this lost colony of broken,
helpless souls?</i>

708
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,930
I hope you sleep well, Mr. Lopez.

709
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,534
I hope the whole world sleeps well.

710
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,543
A- D-A-M C-R-A-N-E.
He wants to meet you.

711
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,642
Who?
