1
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,748
Sport casino floors.

2
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,504
Over 100,000 square
feet of VIP gaming.

3
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,174
I mean, she's a beauty.
She's of steel.

4
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:24,220
Yeah, we're going to call her
the queen of the red.

5
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,298
The grand casino.
It's going to be perfect.

6
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,779
<i>(little boy)
if you Wikipedia death,</i>

7
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:28,156
<i>it says it is the permanent termination
of all biological functions</i>

8
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:32,410
<i>that sustain
living organisms.</i>

9
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:35,458
<i>What it doesn't tell you
is how to cope with death.</i>

10
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,627
You have
to let go, Gracie.

11
00:02:37,702 --> 00:02:40,000
It's the only way
to say goodbye.

12
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,127
<i>When we lost Samson,</i>

13
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:44,208
<i>Gracie and I were the
saddest we've ever been.</i>

14
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:46,636
<i>(Gracie)
Bye, Samson.</i>

15
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:49,510
<i>My Mom says that life

16
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,512
<i>no matter
how big or small,</i>

17
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,434
<i>happen in threes.</i>

18
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,807
<i>I must get back
to work, okay?</i>

19
00:02:55,887 --> 00:02:58,640
Come.
Wait. Did you sign it?

20
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:00,441
Oh, no.

21
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,985
<i>Samson was the first.
[horse neighs]</i>

22
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,733
<i>And then, he arrived.</i>

23
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:09,363
Look!
A horse?

24
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,241
<i>The third would happen
within four days,</i>

25
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,746
<i>and show us that life
really comes full circle.</i>

26
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:24,336
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,386
Can I help you?

28
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:40,231
Yeah, this
the Henderson house?

29
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,274
<i>Si.</i>

30
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:45,356
I'm your Uncle Scott.

31
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:48,110
<i>Your daddy's brother.</i>

32
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,032
He never mentioned me?

33
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,370
You must be Todd.

34
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,122
No, Charles.

35
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,124
Shit.

36
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,252
Caroline.

37
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:09,211
My name is Gracie Ann,
and I'm 6 and 3/4s.

38
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:13,548
Well, Gracie Ann,
I'm 31 years old.

39
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,134
Excuse me, sir, but Mr. Henderson
is not here right now.

40
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:19,011
<i>Where did he go? He's
out of town for work.</i>

41
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,768
Ah.

42
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:22,314
<i>(Gracie) Can I pet your horse ?</i>

43
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,563
You sure can.

44
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:26,985
My horse's name
is Moose.

45
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,114
Moosey.

46
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,283
You can pat him.

47
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,032
That's him
saying hi.

48
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:39,331
<i>(Gracie)
He's so nice.</i>

49
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,122
<i>Yeah, he's a good one.
I like him.</i>

50
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:44,544
<i>Me, too.</i>

51
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,292
Why do you ride
a horse?

52
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:49,625
<i>Well, Charles
I got a DUI-</i>

53
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,381
They took my license.

54
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,712
<i>Ain't that a bitch ?</i>

55
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,470
So, what
happened here?

56
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,678
(Gracie)
Samson passed away.

57
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,855
Oh, I'm sorry.

58
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,774
That really sucks.
How did it happen?

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,775
I'm in the middle of an investigation.
Could be foul play.

60
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:13,448
You mean murder?
Possibly.

61
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,366
Samson have
many enemies?

62
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,319
I haven't ruled
anyone out yet,

63
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,746
but there is one person
I'm focusing on.

64
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,576
<i>Oh, who's that?
[woman ta/king]</i>

65
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,457
If I wanted carnations, don't you
think I would've ordered them?

66
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,459
I asked
for the great rose.

67
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:31,633
<i>I asked for them.
I did ask for them</i>

68
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,961
Mom hates frogs.

69
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:36,843
Did you say a frog?
Wait, Samson was a frog?

70
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:39,174
He was an oriental
fire belly toad.

71
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,682
You got a fucking
love frog.

72
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:44,809
Shh.

73
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:48,893
He was a nice king frog.
He never got to be a prince.

74
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,943
At least I got
a chance to know him.

75
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,899
I think that's about the
nicest eulogy I ever heard.

76
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,951
I should be so lucky
when I go.

77
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:00,992
What's a eulogy? It's what
you say at a funeral.

78
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,870
Yes, your psalm.
Your psalm?

79
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,497
Like your net worth.

80
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,796
That grand total of your
entire life in three lines.

81
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:13,842
<i>(Mum) All right, you guys,
enough of this nonsense.</i>

82
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,386
What the hell
is that?

83
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,465
<i>[horse whinnies]</i>

84
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:23,177
<i>Who are you?
Excuse me.</i>

85
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,886
Check this out.

86
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,313
Hey, sister.
How the hell are you?

87
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,311
[gasps]
[glass breaks]

88
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,316
Nice house.

89
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,022
Why are you here?
You need money?

90
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,861
Mom told me you all needed my help.
So, here I am.

91
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,037
Your mother?
When?

92
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,830
Couple of days ago.

93
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,499
<i>Couple of days ago ?
Where ?</i>

94
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,621
Coffee shop.

95
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,370
Nana?
Yeah, Nana.

96
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,047
I refer to her
as Mom but--

97
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,467
Scott, are you okay?
Nana's dead.

98
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:01,139
Yes, I know. That's
what makes it so wild.

99
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,308
I'm sitting there at Jake's a couple of
days ago having a coffee and a smoke

100
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:08,638
when, I don't know where, Mom's
sitting next to me. I swear to God.

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,351
<i>I just' smoked a little that morning,
so I thought it was me being high,</i>

102
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,528
<i>but buzz wore off,
she stuck round.</i>

103
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,152
She told me
some stuff.

104
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,861
One thing leads to
another, and here I am.

105
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:27,073
How come we've
never met you?

106
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,534
I've been--
Been traveling.

107
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,995
<i>Traveling ?
Where ? Honduras ?</i>

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,590
I ain't never made it
to Honduras.

109
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,338
Truth calls
for some whiskey.

110
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,929
[whispers]
Shit.

111
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:47,636
Charles, I've spent the better part of the
last eight years in and out of hospitals.

112
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,938
Are you <i>a</i> doctor?
Thank you, Charles.

113
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,731
No.

114
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,353
Are you sick?

115
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,980
You could say that.

116
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,777
<i>Testicular cancer?</i>

117
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,606
That's what Lance
Armstrong suffered from.

118
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,032
[laughs]

119
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,950
Do you like
Lance Armstrong?

120
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,279
No.

121
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,285
<i>No to a testicular cancer or
no to liking Lance Armstrong ?</i>

122
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,910
<i>Both. So, why were
you in the hospital?</i>

123
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,745
Your uncle
here is---

124
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,207
Was a little crazy and a
kind of a drug addict.

125
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,920
Gracie. What? It's all right.
It's just funny.

126
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,802
Who doesn't think
a crazy person's fun?

127
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,600
Point is,
I'm better now.

128
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,350
Is that why you had coffee a couple
of days ago with your dead mother?

129
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,477
<i>(Charles) For the
last eight years</i>

130
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,933
<i>you've been in a
mental institution ?</i>

131
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,691
<i>In and out. Also spent
quite a bit of time</i>

132
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,650
in a rehab facility for drug
and alcohol dependency.

133
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,985
It ain't tight.

134
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,287
You know, guys,
go upstairs, please.

135
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,490
<i>Louisa!
What?</i>

136
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,540
<i>Please, take
the children upstairs.</i>

137
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,210
<i>[Gracie speaking
in Spanish]</i>

138
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,585
<i>In English in the house when
Mommy's around, please-</i>

139
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,839
<i>Why are you here ?</i>

140
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,387
Fuck me.
Why are you here?

141
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,090
We moved here to be closer to
your dad after your mom died.

142
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,344
He has-- Alzheimers, so he says.

143
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,599
Hey, hey, how
did you know that?

144
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,432
Mom told me.

145
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,358
There's no smoking
in the house.

146
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,444
Come on.

147
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,779
You know, Cathy, I never figured you
for living in a house like this.

148
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,162
Things change.
People change.

149
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,542
Did you hear me? There's
no smoking in the house.

150
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,998
All right.

151
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,550
You know what?
Mom's right.

152
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,003
Is that how you should
have been at her funeral?

153
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,304
<i>No, about Charles. Really?
What did she say?</i>

154
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,264
Is he gay?
What?

155
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,225
<i>I don't know why she said he's
gay, but he is a little strange.</i>

156
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,568
It's a Vicodin.
You want one?

157
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,116
No, I don't want
a Vicodin.

158
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,444
Doctor's orders.

159
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,080
<i>Where's Willy?</i>

160
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,875
He'd deck you if he heard
you call him that.

161
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,204
Shreveport, I think,
till Thursday.

162
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,585
<i>Today's Sunday?
Today's Tuesday.</i>

163
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,590
So, I lost a couple
of days somewhere.

164
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,593
I take it there isn't a job you
have to be at during the week?

165
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,674
<i>What's your job ?</i>

166
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,684
<i>All right.</i>

167
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,777
I really want
to see my brother,

168
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:49,026
so I'm thinking maybe I'll just
hang here until he gets back.

169
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:56,617
It is great
to see you, Cathy.

170
00:10:56,696 --> 00:10:58,698
<i>You still look
pretty hot-</i>

171
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:09,376
[buzzing]

172
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,678
<i>(man) Now, you were killing
it out there today.</i>

173
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,302
<i>Big dog,

call her that?

193

Mommy "sister."

195
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:08,787

up after she married your daddy.

not your sister.</i>

Yeah, that's just
'cause we go way back.

Of course we kissed. Lovers,
we did everything. I--

206
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,858
Is that why
you went to the rehab?

Kids, I don't want you to get
too attached to your uncle.

214

He's got a lot
of problems.

215
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:38,834
Maybe we can help him.
I think he's funny.

I doubt it.

220
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:47,138
Does he have any kids?
Oh, God, I hope not.

221
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:50,016
Where does he work
? I'm sure he doesn't.

Where does
he get money?

223
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:54,645
That's probably
why he's here.

224
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:57,648
How come he gets
to have a horse?

225

Why do you have
a horse?

233
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:43,564
This guy of Memphis owed me some money.
I took the horse instead.

234
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:46,197
Worked out well, 'cause
I got a couple of DUIs,

anything with a key.

00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,117
Sorry.

348
00:26:25,242 --> 00:26:27,665
Do you see any blood back there?
No, you're fine.

349
00:26:27,744 --> 00:26:29,212
I'll show you.
Come here.

350
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,921
[humming]

351
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:36,670
No laughing.

352
00:26:36,753 --> 00:26:39,097
So, how
am I looking?

353
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,185
Ready for school.

354
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,433
Unbelievable.

355
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:49,312
I can't say that I'm surprised.
That is who she is.

356
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:53,112
Ever since Josh got his inheritance,
she is a different person.

357
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:56,736
Hi, everyone. Oh, Katherine,
what a great event.

358
00:26:56,815 --> 00:27:00,661
Oh, I've booked our tickets for
the 4th of July. So excited.

359
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,831
I've rented this most
amazing house in Seaside.

360
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:06,408
I'm surprising
William and the kids.

361
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,540
I mean, you all should come.
That sounds wonderful.

362
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:11,747
I'll see you in a bit.
See you later.

363
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,804
What is going on? Sue said,
Elena said, Angie said

364
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:21,052
some man came out of
your house this morning,

365
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:23,600
and asked her son
for a cigarette.

366
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,598
Are you having
an affair?

367
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,771
It's okay if you are, but why
are we the last to know?

368
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,472
No, no, it's William's brother.

369
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:32,809
[gasps] You're having
an affair with Scott?

370
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:36,192
No, he's here
to see William.

371
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,274
William is never--

372
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,110
[clears throat]
He's not home.

373
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,497
Cool if I sit down?

374
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,499
What are you
doing here?

375
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,878
You're going
to get me in trouble.

376
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:58,880
All right.
Well,

377
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,462
how about this,
if I hide?

378
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,762
<i>Who's that?</i>

379
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:08,515
<i>Amanda Hyde. Why?</i>

380
00:28:08,594 --> 00:28:10,312
I think
she's into you.

381
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,562
Question is,
are you into her?

382
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,485
Hey, it's totally
okay if you're not.

383
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,109
I am, but I think
you're crazy.

384
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:21,566
She hates me. They
all make fun of me.

385
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,277
That's
fucked up.

386
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:27,488
Okay, how
about this?

387
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:30,450
I'll go over there, and get Miss
Hyde to come and say hello.

388
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:32,752
Then you and I are square. Deal?

389
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:35,079
Do-don't.

390
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,671
That's some
good <i>ass</i> juice.

391
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:46,383
You can't get juice
like that on the outside.

392
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:49,935
I'm just screwing with you. You
can get juice on the outside.

393
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,857
Not that I've ever been inside of prison.
I've been in jail.

394
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:56,650
Don't freak out, dude.

395
00:28:56,725 --> 00:29:00,480
I got his-- I got
everybody in line.

396
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,825
And this one's
for you, darling.

397
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,527
See that little girl
at the end of the line

398
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,658
with the pink ribbon
and pony tail?

399
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,831
<i>You get her
whatever she wants</i>

400
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:13,785
Tell her it's on Charles Henderson,
and you keep the change.

401
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,132
How are you related to my dad?

402
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:30,309
Thank you.

403
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,932
Oh, boy, here comes Dr. Carr.

404
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,514
<i>He hates me.</i>

405
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:38,061
Why? Because I
cracked at him once.

406
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:40,856
Hi, what's up?

407
00:29:40,935 --> 00:29:43,358
What is your name?

408
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,406
Scott Henderson.

409
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:47,860
Charles, do you know this man?

410
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:49,990
He's my uncle.

411
00:29:50,069 --> 00:29:53,118
And you two
beautiful ladies are--

412
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:57,499
Miss Carol. Nice to meet you.
And this is Miss Dougan.

413
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:59,079
Join us!

414
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,005
Juice?

415
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,299
Excuse me, but you have
to have a visitor's badge

416
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:05,172
in order to eat lunch
with a student.

417
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:09,381
<i>I do. And where is
your visitor's badge?</i>

418
00:30:09,464 --> 00:30:11,466
I lost it.

419
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:12,641
Where did you
lose it?

420
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:14,845
Don't know.

421
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:18,728
If I did, it wouldn't
be classified as lost.

422
00:30:18,806 --> 00:30:21,605
Who did you
check in with?

423
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:25,609
All right, boss, you got me.
I didn't check in.

424
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:28,612
I'm just here to have lunch with my nephew.
It's no big deal.

425
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:31,114
Y'all feel free
to join us.

426
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,697
Shit, we got juice
for fucking days.

427
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,786
You will not use profanity toward an educator,
especially in front of his student.

428
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:41,291
I didn't.
What did I say?

429
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:43,715
<i>You know what
you said, sir.</i>

430
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,634
Okay, that's it. Both
of you, let's go now!

431
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,507
Now, hold up,
hold on.

432
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,384
Your problem's
with me, not him.

433
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:53,224
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

434
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:56,636
All right.

435
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:59,973
Miss Dougan
and Miss Carol.

436
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:02,434
Later, Charles.

437
00:31:05,311 --> 00:31:07,279
<i>(Amanda)
Thank you, Charles</i>

438
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,320
From a very nice
Cohiba, and he says,

439
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:16,532
"Son, I won't smoke a cigar if
it's smaller than my penis."

440
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,992
I'll drink
to that.

441
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:21,123
Come on.

442
00:31:21,202 --> 00:31:23,705
I never had a chance to talk to
you about that Carlton deal.

443
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:26,382
The architecture from
that deal was flawless.

444
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,334
You drove up the offer
against the Dow.

445
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:31,508
Five weekends in a row. Yeah.

446
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:33,431
I didn't think
anybody noticed that.

447
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:36,518
<i>I've used it on two deals since.
No kidding? Wow.</i>

448
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,311
You two work together in Dallas?
<i>Yeah.</i>

449
00:31:38,386 --> 00:31:40,854
<i>Thanks for the lift,
compadre.</i>

450
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:43,520
Do you mind making another stop?
Si, cémo no.

451
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:48,270
You've ever met
my old man?

452
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:51,148
What are you,
a migrant?

453
00:31:52,774 --> 00:31:54,993
All right.

454
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:57,241
It's up here
on the left.

455
00:32:12,794 --> 00:32:13,886
Hey...

456
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,012
Who are you?

457
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:20,894
Dad, it's Scott.

458
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:25,437
Now, look here, mister.

459
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:28,394
I don't know who
you're looking for,

460
00:32:28,477 --> 00:32:30,980
but I can assure you
it's not me.

461
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:35,489
Sometimes I-I like
to talk to strangers.

462
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,114
Sometimes I don't.

463
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:39,447
I know you're faking
this sickness.

464
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,952
You need to get off my property.

465
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,581
Mom told me she wants
us to talk, so--

466
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:50,090
<i>You know what? You are
still a fucking asshole.</i>

467
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:51,712
<i>I tried.</i>

468
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:55,137
Hey, I ain't going
to tell you again.

469
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:57,510
<i>Are you kidding me?
Mr. Henderson.</i>

470
00:32:57,631 --> 00:33:00,475
I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Go.

471
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:03,015
Calm down. Why do these people
always coming round my house?

472
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:05,473
<i>Come on in the house.
Come on now.</i>

473
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:07,933
<i>I go! you a big bowl of chili.
Do you want some chili?</i>

474
00:33:08,016 --> 00:33:12,647
<i>(Gracie) Hi, Uncle Scott.
Uncle Scott.</i>

475
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,982
Louisa and I are cooking
eggplant tonight.

476
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:16,863
Want to help?

477
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:19,536
I ain't feeling
so hot, pretty girl.

478
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:29,505
<i>Mrs. Henderson, this is
Mr. Dewitt, Charles ' Principal.</i>

479
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,207
<i>It seems we had
an incidence today.</i>

480
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,090
<i>A man claiming to be Charles'
uncle broke into the cafeteria,</i>

481
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:38,263
<i>shouted profanity
at a teacher,</i>

482
00:33:38,338 --> 00:33:42,138
<i>made a pass at one of our
aides, smoked cigarettes.</i>

483
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:44,094
<i>The list goes on.</i>

484
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:50,941
[knocking]

485
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:53,018
Shit.

486
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:54,570
Come in.

487
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:59,867
Amanda thanked me for the juice box.
That was awesome.

488
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:02,821
Yeah, it kind of was.

489
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:05,664
<i>Listen, homie, I'm tired. I
have to give an oral report</i>

490
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,085
<i>on the Aztecs on Friday in
front of the whole school.</i>

491
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,413
Sweet.

492
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:14,791
What's the problem?

493
00:34:18,377 --> 00:34:22,007
If I get a bad grade,
it'll ruin my average.

494
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,841
They give grades
at your age?

495
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,177
They do
in fourth grade.

496
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,762
I thought
you were six.

497
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,813
I'm eight.

498
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,814
I skipped second grade, and I
want to make straight A's.

499
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:37,363
<i>Dude, there's a lot more to
life than just straight A 's-</i>

500
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,194
[clears th roat]

501
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:45,075
All right, so what's your problem?
You're a smart kid, man.

502
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:48,033
I'm not very proficient
at oral reports.

503
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:50,618
Public speaking
should be easy for you.

504
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,419
Why?

505
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:54,497
Because you're not
intimidated by shit.

506
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,878
How do you know that
I'm not intimidated?

507
00:34:56,957 --> 00:35:01,212
<i>Dude, look at you. The shirt,
the lie, the goddamn briefcase.</i>

508
00:35:01,295 --> 00:35:04,595
All them things ain't nothing
more than FU's to everybody.

509
00:35:04,715 --> 00:35:06,888
Yeah?
Shit, yeah.

510
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,595
Okay, here we go.

511
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:12,807
A key
to public speaking.

512
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,064
You find one face in the
crowd that you trust, okay?

513
00:35:16,143 --> 00:35:19,238
<i>You focus on that face,
concentrate on it.</i>

514
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:22,692
<i>Ignore everything else.</i>

515
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:26,530
And once you're comfortable with that
person, you start adding another, another,

516
00:35:26,612 --> 00:35:28,205
one by one.

517
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,409
Before you know it,
you're good.

518
00:35:31,492 --> 00:35:34,336
Uncle Scott, will you
come to the assembly?

519
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:38,419
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

520
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:40,968
Please, just
this one time.

521
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:44,343
<i>I'll even get you
a visitor's pass.</i>

522
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:49,018
Shit, it's hard for me
to commit to things.

523
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:54,598
All right.

524
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:57,059
I'll be there.

525
00:35:57,141 --> 00:36:00,441
Katherine eluded to the
fact they're unreliable.

526
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,522
So you have
to promise.

527
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:08,528
I promise.

528
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:34,596
<i>What a day. I can't believe
we're still not closed.</i>

529
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,977
Oh, we're this close
to closing.

530
00:36:37,056 --> 00:36:38,979
Then you get to head
home after all this?

531
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:42,653
I wish. New York on Monday.

532
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:45,528
New Jersey on Saturday, and
home to Chicago on Thursday.

533
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:47,701
That's quite
a schedule.

534
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,448
Wow.

535
00:36:49,527 --> 00:36:51,700
Want to grab
a drink?

536
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:54,703
Sure, sounds good.

537
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:57,160
Okay, so you're
marrying Katie Couric.

538
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,166
Yes. I'm Bill Couric.
How are you doing?

539
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:00,838
[laughing]

540
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:03,588
That's a no brainer.
So, Ellen or Martha?

541
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,044
Hold on. If you go with Ellen,

542
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:07,504
you get
a little portion?

543
00:37:07,587 --> 00:37:09,840
No, it's only Ellen.

544
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:13,644
Now, what about Martha? Is this a
one-night stand or a long-term affair?

545
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:16,016
Three times a week.
Okay.

546
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:18,689
I'm banging Ellen.
Final decision.

547
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:21,268
So, you're going to
kill Martha Stewart.

548
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:23,524
By default, even
though I don't want to

549
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:26,402
'cause she's the one who has the
best taste out of all these women.

550
00:37:26,522 --> 00:37:30,117
It's like killing Christmas.
Yeah.

551
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:33,072
You imagine the Christmas you'd
have with Martha Stewart?

552
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:34,747
Beautiful.
My God.

553
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:37,325
It would be like being
on the North Pole.

554
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,627
Okay, you gotta play.

555
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:44,549
You got
Rob Blagojevich, okay?

556
00:37:44,624 --> 00:37:47,503
Disgraced governor
of Illinois.

557
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:50,964
Then you got Anthony Weiner,
disgraced congressman.

558
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:54,517
And then you got
Skipper Spitzer.

559
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:57,390
How about a little Elliot Spitzer?
Disgraced governor.

560
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:59,892
Three guys on the ropes.
What do you do?

561
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:03,226
Did you go to Charles'
school today?

562
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:05,106
Somebody
missed dinner.

563
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:07,938
Did you?
What did you hear?

564
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,694
<i>That you broke
into the school</i>

565
00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:12,743
and started a fight
with one of the teachers?

566
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,116
That's ridiculous.
That's not at all how--

567
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:17,243
I'm not interested in your
version of the story.

568
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:20,413
I'll leave you alone for not even half a day.
Well, full day.

569
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:22,995
What part of "there are
rules" do you not understand?

570
00:38:23,078 --> 00:38:25,251
Like the one that forbids
absentee white trash uncles

571
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,957
from trespassing
on school property,

572
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,635
cursing in the cafeteria
and humiliating me!

573
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:32,759
Wow.

574
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:35,933
Just so you know? You're
kind of being a cunt.

575
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:42,556
Dana Spencer.
No, no.

576
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,397
You're flirting
with our deal.

577
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:50,781
I'm not flirting
with our deal.

578
00:38:50,856 --> 00:38:54,156
Dana just happens to be an
old colleague, that's all.

579
00:38:56,194 --> 00:38:58,367
What's going on
with you and Katherine?

580
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,499
Things just haven't been
very good for awhile.

581
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:07,377
Well, well.

582
00:39:07,456 --> 00:39:10,960
What's Katherine say?

583
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:15,093
I don't even-- I don't even
think think she knows.

584
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:20,769
You know she was my
brother's first girlfriend?

585
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:22,892
Yeah, that's
how we met.

586
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,769
[laughs]

587
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:28,273
Yeah. My brother,
[clears throat]

588
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:32,231
He and my dad
had a big blowout.

589
00:39:32,314 --> 00:39:36,160
My brother left town. Just kind of disappeared.
Didn't come back.

590
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:38,828
She was devastated,
you know?

591
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:41,908
And, uh,
it just happened.

592
00:39:44,076 --> 00:39:46,499
Next thing you know,
she'd gotten pregnant.

593
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:48,922
We got married.

594
00:39:48,997 --> 00:39:50,999
You know.

595
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,212
She was just a kid.

596
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:57,138
Oh, shot gun
wedding.

597
00:39:57,214 --> 00:40:01,219
No, no, not at all.
It was the real deal.

598
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:04,645
She-- Yeah.

599
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,021
She was really
what I wanted.

600
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,195
But I don't know what's
happened now, you know.

601
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,275
I've spent the better part of the
year trying to figure it out.

602
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:18,985
I just --

603
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:23,618
We just stopped
being us.

604
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:42,759
<i>This is William. Can '1 come
lo the phone right now,</i>

605
00:40:42,842 --> 00:40:45,095
<i>so please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.</i>

606
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:46,474
<i>Thank you.</i>

607
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,822
[door opens]

608
00:41:07,408 --> 00:41:09,251
Come on.

609
00:41:18,335 --> 00:41:21,088
[coughing]

610
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:22,924
That was
almost perfect,

611
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:26,637
but then you kind of
cough like a bitch.

612
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,721
It's been ten years.
Shit.

613
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,393
Remember how you used to
make me shot gun your hits

614
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:36,900
because you'd say
"Joints burnt my throat"?

615
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,319
They did burn my throat.
Come on.

616
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:43,028
You pulled filters
off of Camels.

617
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,862
I think you were
just saying it

618
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:46,868
'cause you wanted to get
close enough to kiss me.

619
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:48,449
Yeah, right.

620
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:56,294
I saw Dad today.

621
00:41:56,373 --> 00:41:58,046
<i>And?</i>

622
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,628
He wanted to shoot
me in the face.

623
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:02,634
<i>He's really sick.</i>

624
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:18,228
So, how is it being a parent?

625
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:26,570
It's amazing how quickly I
disappeared when Gracie was born.

626
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:29,577
First kid's easy.

627
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:33,251
Second kid
changes everything.

628
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,088
Why do you ask?

629
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:41,134
I don't know.

630
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:44,804
I think I could've
made a good father.

631
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:49,100
For real. I mean, I love
your little people.

632
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,690
See this water?

633
00:42:56,766 --> 00:43:01,317
We test the PH of this water.
It's perfect.

634
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:03,273
I don't even swim.

635
00:43:10,446 --> 00:43:13,871
God, pot is so--

636
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,624
Wow.

637
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:20,962
I forgot how much it
makes you wan to--

638
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,839
Fuck?

639
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:27,388
I was going to say
dance, you pervert.

640
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:30,182
Don't give me that
cotillion bullshit.

641
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:32,477
You and I
used to get stoned,

642
00:43:32,552 --> 00:43:35,305
and do it
all the fucking time.

643
00:43:40,268 --> 00:43:41,986
Shot gun?

644
00:43:42,061 --> 00:43:45,486
<i>♫ Find a /over

That somehow I'd fall

656
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:31,030
No.

657
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:35,948
I'm here to let you know you
made the right decision.

659
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:11,950
He tried to shoot me

660
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:15,697
That thing wasn't loaded.
Oh, come on.

<i>He was just scared.</i>

662
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:20,079
He acted like he
didn't know who I was.

663
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,418
I don't know, Momma.

664
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:29,293

00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:32,255
It's difficult shit for me to do.

668
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:51,982
Good morning.

669
00:45:54,276 --> 00:45:57,029
I'm going to the farmers' market.
Does anyone need anything?

670
00:45:57,112 --> 00:46:00,707
You are going
to the farmers' market?

671
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:03,786
<i>Mommy, can</i> I <i>come
to the farm, too?</i>

672
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:06,418
No, I'm getting
groceries.

673
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,718
Of course you can come. I'll
drop you at school afterwards.

674
00:46:11,793 --> 00:46:14,046
Charles, any requests?

675
00:46:14,129 --> 00:46:16,257
Pomegranate juice.

676
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:22,303
Hey, Carlos.

677
00:46:22,386 --> 00:46:23,854
I need
another favor.

678
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:25,146
<i>Oué?</i>

682
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:37,110

right now,

00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,710
I won't put up
with this no more.

686
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:48,795
Ain't going to happen no more.

00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:02,036
<i>That's all, I guess.</i>

865
01:00:02,116 --> 01:00:03,709
<i>I miss you.</i>

[Joe <i>Purdy</i> singing
Take Me or Leave Me]

867
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,597
Good morning, everyone.

868
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:14,112
Where's Uncle Scott?
He's not in his room.

869
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:15,780
Charles, sit down.

870
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:19,325
<i>(Charles)
Where is Moose?</i>

871
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,700
Your Uncle Scott left in
the middle of the night.

872
01:01:24,655 --> 01:01:29,035
He'll be back. He promised
me he would help me today.

873
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,588
He left. I-I don't think
he's coming back.

874
01:01:32,663 --> 01:01:35,963
He will.
You don't know that?

875
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,261
Maybe.

876
01:01:38,336 --> 01:01:42,057
He will!
You watch.

877
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,314
I'm going to kill him,
I swear to God.

878
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:49,036
You want a ride?

879
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:56,581
You can sit
up front.

880
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:03,301
Your Uncle Scott is old like,
you know, me and your dad.

881
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:06,928
<i>But he's still got a /at of
growing up to do, like you guys.</i>

882
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:09,681
I don't think Uncle Scott
knows how to grow up.

883
01:03:12,512 --> 01:03:15,436
Maybe it was my fault
Uncle Scott left.

884
01:03:15,515 --> 01:03:17,734
<i>I did pressure him.</i>

885
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:20,653
Don't you ever
think that.

886
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:29,488
(Scott) Don't crowd
him too much.

887
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,998
<i>(Charles)
Uncle Scott.</i>

888
01:03:36,495 --> 01:03:37,963
Hey, man,
come here.

889
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,042
Can you watch
my horse for me?

890
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:46,634
Hey...

891
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:50,513
I decided to get here early and
cut through all the red tape.

892
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:57,478
And these
are for you.

893
01:03:57,557 --> 01:04:00,060
I'm sorry
about last night.

894
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:02,737
I was kind
of A-hole.

895
01:04:04,856 --> 01:04:08,326
You ready to do this,
big man? Yeah?

896
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:09,948
All right,
go get them.

897
01:04:12,197 --> 01:04:15,792
<i>Hey, Charles,
come here.</i>

898
01:04:15,867 --> 01:04:18,791
I want to give you this.
for good luck.

899
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,747
It's called a "ku".

900
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:22,582
A fisherman
gave it to me.

901
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:25,886
It's kinda like a Mayan
ying yang thing.

902
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:28,718
Go get them, dude.

903
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,019
Last up today
is Charles Henderson.

904
01:04:34,094 --> 01:04:37,394
He'll be giving
a report on the Aztecs.

905
01:04:38,598 --> 01:04:39,724
Charles?

906
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:52,821
We--

907
01:04:52,904 --> 01:04:57,330
We all know
the Aztecs ruled

908
01:04:57,409 --> 01:04:59,958
all of Mexico

909
01:05:00,036 --> 01:05:04,337
before Cortes conquered
them in 1533.

910
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,463
Mexico City t-today

911
01:05:09,546 --> 01:05:14,301
stands on the ruins of the
Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan.

912
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:19,848
And the Aztecs were a
highly advanced empire

913
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:22,183
that reigned
for 300 years

914
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:25,691
over a nation larger
than the United States,

915
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:29,273
with the capital twice
the size of London.

916
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:33,323
But what most
people don't know

917
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:37,327
know is the way the Aztec nation
reigned over so many people,

918
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:40,034
was that they would capture
anyone who opposed them,

919
01:05:40,117 --> 01:05:42,711
and sacrifice them
to the gods.

920
01:05:42,786 --> 01:05:45,289
[audience gasps]

921
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:50,469
So, what they did was they
would take a conquistador,

922
01:05:50,544 --> 01:05:52,797
and each priest would
get an arm or leg,

923
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,009
and they would stretch
him out over this rock,

924
01:05:56,091 --> 01:05:59,561
and the high priest would take this
flint, this really sharp rock,

925
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:01,639
and he would hold it
above his head,

926
01:06:01,722 --> 01:06:03,599
in front
of the Aztec nation,

927
01:06:03,682 --> 01:06:06,606
and he would slam it right
through the breast bone.

928
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:09,234
[cheering]

929
01:06:09,313 --> 01:06:11,657
And he would reach
into the Spaniard's chest

930
01:06:11,732 --> 01:06:13,530
and he would
rip out the heart.

931
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:16,078
[cheering]

932
01:06:16,153 --> 01:06:17,951
And he would
hold it out

933
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:21,330
in front of the whole Aztec
nation, still bleeding.

934
01:06:21,408 --> 01:06:24,628
And he would scream
"To the Gods".

935
01:06:24,703 --> 01:06:27,297
[cheering]

936
01:06:32,002 --> 01:06:36,178
But none of that is in any
of the history books.

937
01:06:36,256 --> 01:06:39,055
They don't
teach that to kids.

938
01:06:39,134 --> 01:06:42,889
<i>$0, it just goes to show that
sometimes history is remembered</i>

939
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:45,269
<i>the way grown ups
wished it happened.</i>

940
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:50,446
<i>And sometimes the truth just
gets buried with the past.</i>

941
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:51,943
That's my boy.

942
01:06:52,022 --> 01:06:54,525

943
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,891
Here you go.
Keep the change.

944
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:23,220
I appreciate it.
Thanks.

945
01:07:44,323 --> 01:07:47,372
Hey, how are you doing, Louisa?
<i>Good.</i>

946
01:07:47,452 --> 01:07:49,125
Where's Katherine?

947
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,044
She went to Charles' assembly.
Oh, okay.

948
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:54,793
How are doing? I'm good.
Thank you.

949
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:58,254

950
01:07:58,337 --> 01:08:00,806
Do you--

951
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:04,352
Do you-do you know
anything about the--

952
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:07,397
Okay, guys, wash up your hands.
They'll be here soon.

953
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:17,315
So, why is there a goddamn
horse in the back yard?

954
01:08:19,066 --> 01:08:21,615
Hey, Willie.
How have you been?

955
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:25,574
That horse, Moose,
is mine actually.

956
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:27,909
And I was thinking about giving
it to your boy, Charles.

957
01:08:27,992 --> 01:08:29,994
What are you do--

958
01:08:30,077 --> 01:08:32,330
He just showed up a couple of days.
Why don't you ask him?

959
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:34,586
They're here.
Your father's here.

960
01:08:34,665 --> 01:08:36,542
What's he doing here?

961
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:38,628
I told you. He's coming
over for dinner for your--

962
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:42,136
No. Actually, you haven't told
me a lot of things lately.

963
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,849
Hello, Pappy.

964
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:48,225
Hello.

965
01:08:51,724 --> 01:08:53,726
<i>Hey, Dad.
How are doing?</i>

966
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:58,105
Pa.

967
01:08:58,189 --> 01:09:00,408
Oh. Good to see you.

968
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:03,703
Dinner's almost ready.
Dad, you must be starving.

969
01:09:03,778 --> 01:09:05,951
Where's Joe?
Who's Joe?

970
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:09,250
He's been talking all day about
playing bridge with his friend Joe.

971
01:09:09,325 --> 01:09:12,249
How can he play bridge
if he's <i>so</i> sick?

972
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:14,877
Is Joe your
imaginary friend?

973
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:20,170
No smoking
in the house.

974
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:22,505
So?

975
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:26,929
This family's fucked.

976
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:36,898
No shit.

977
01:09:36,977 --> 01:09:39,605
I've been saying that for years.

George, how about
you sit over here?

984
01:10:08,592 --> 01:10:10,219
I'm not sitting here.

985
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:12,766
Oh, come on, Mr. Henderson.
Where's Joe?

986
01:10:12,846 --> 01:10:15,850
<i>I'm sure Joe will be here any minute.
Now, come on, have a seat.</i>

How about
you sit here?

988
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:23,486
Ah, nice.

989
01:10:23,565 --> 01:10:26,990
Charles, would you just
sit down, please? Thanks.

990
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:29,196
Welcome
to the family.

George and Margaret.
Here, here.

994
01:10:38,413 --> 01:10:41,087
Well, I think we should
say thank you to Kathy.

995
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:44,010
I have to say it's
very generous of you

996
01:10:44,085 --> 01:10:46,759
to prepare this dinner
in honor of our parents--

997
01:10:46,838 --> 01:10:49,808
Why did you even
come here?

998
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:52,056
Mom told me to come,
back in Tennessee.

999
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:54,433
Sorry, come again?

1000
01:10:56,556 --> 01:10:59,150
To be honest, she
wanted me to come here

1001
01:10:59,225 --> 01:11:00,977
and make amends
with you.

1002
01:11:01,061 --> 01:11:03,484
Get to know Charles
and Gracie, see Dad.

1003
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:06,066
She gave me a whole
list of things,

1004
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:10,074
and I got on my horse
and here I am.

1005

peace with you.

Charles.

1046
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:56,586
Call the ambulance!
Katherine, call the ambulance!

1047
01:14:56,669 --> 01:15:00,219
Scott. Scott. Scott.
Do you hear me?

1048
01:15:00,298 --> 01:15:02,801
Scott. Jesus. Hurry!

1049
01:15:02,884 --> 01:15:05,228
Scott.
Come on, Scott.

1050
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:20,447
Mr. Henderson?
Yeah.

1051
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:23,450
May I, please,
see you a moment?

1052
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:25,702
What's happened?
Is he okay?

1053
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,123
He's stable, but he's in a level three coma.
What does that mean?

1054
01:15:29,202 --> 01:15:32,957
Was it an overdose? He has
a history of drug abuse.

1055
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:35,633
Uh, your brother
never told you

1056
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:39,428
he was being treated in
Tennessee for a glioblastoma?

1057
01:15:41,546 --> 01:15:43,264
A type of brain tumor.

1058
01:15:44,716 --> 01:15:46,434
Wait a second. What?

1059
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:49,388
They found it a year
ago during a routine MRI.

1060
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:51,894
Because it's
a spectrum of symptoms,

1061
01:15:51,973 --> 01:15:56,854
everything from intense
migraines to hallucinations.

1062
01:15:56,937 --> 01:15:58,985
I'm surprised
he's lasted this long.

1063
01:15:59,064 --> 01:16:02,364
He's going into oncology
for a CAT scan.

1064
01:16:02,442 --> 01:16:04,945
You can probably
see him tomorrow.
