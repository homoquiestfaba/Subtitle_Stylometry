362
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,300
There goes our jobs.

363
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:20,475
Isn't this car yours?

364
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,216
Well, not exactly.

365
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:23,609
You see, we work
for a body shop

366
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,436
and we sort of borrowed
it for the evening.

367
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,568
Oh, my God.

368
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,178
I'm in a stolen car?

369
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:29,223
You know,
why didn't you tell us

370
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,616
you had a boyfriend?

371
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,531
You know,
I'm really not into

372
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,358
this domestic violence.I do not have a boyfriend.

373
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,491
Just let me out of this car.

374
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,495
Sorry babe.

375
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,935
[thud]

376
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,634
I think that's gonna
be a little tough right now.

377
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:57,773
[Smoke]
What's up with this guy?

378
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,824
He more than likely
wants his car back.

379
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,869
This car belongs
to the government.

380
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,568
He probably wants this.

381
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,485
Well, it's a funny way
to get it.

382
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:22,624
Ah, don't sweat it,
I'll cut it off later.

383
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,191
No offense, but I'll wait

384
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,541
until we get back to the shop
and I'll do it myself.

385
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,325
I suggest we lose
the terminator

386
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:30,023
before we do anything else.

387
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,633
Well, as soon we lose him

388
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:32,634
we got to find a place
to hide

389
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:33,809
because we got to figure out

390
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,376
what's up
with this briefcase.

391
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,204
I just thought of something.

392
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:39,859
We can get off a little ways
up this Alligator Alley.

393
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,251
There's a lot of empty roads
there,

394
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,557
we can lose him there.

395
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,254
My cousin Heather
works there.

396
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:46,517
This place called
Country Restaurant.

397
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:49,564
We'll be fine,
nobody will find us.

398
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,915
Hey Lightnin, there's the exit.

399
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,656
All right.

400
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,180
[Smoke]
Come on Lightnin,
do some of that Lightnin stuff.

401
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,237
Whatever is in that briefcase

402
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,499
must be important, guys.

403
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,109
Yeah.

404
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,982
Important enough for that
maniac to want to kill us.

405
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:18,375
[beeps]

406
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:19,638
Didn't your daddy
ever teach you

407
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,597
how to read gauges?

408
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,253
[Smoke]
Oh, this is not good.

409
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,820
This is not good at all.

410
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,125
And how far down
the road did you say

411
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:31,475
that Country Restaurant was?

412
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,477
It's just a little ways
from here.

413
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,349
I hope we have
enough gas to make it.

414
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,003
We'll make it.

415
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:00,722
Yes, sir.

416
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:05,161
I ran across
a small difficulty.

417
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:09,209
There's no need to remind
me of the significance of it.

418
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:10,210
Yes, sir.
You'll have it in your hands

419
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,342
by tomorrow.

420
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,693
Yes, sir.

421
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,395
Bingo, I got him.

422
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:25,312
Give me the transmitter.

423
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,748
This is Mr. Carter.

424
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:27,880
[Mr. Carter] 
Can you hear me?

425
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,665
Hello?

426
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,275
Don't look at me.

427
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,842
[Smoke] 
You say something.

428
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,539
[Lightnin] 
What?

429
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,237
[Smoke] 
The radio.

430
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,717
What radio?

431
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,328
Give me that.

432
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,418
Hello Mr. Carter,

433
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:47,116
this is Melody Kirton,
can you hear me?

434
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,336
[Mr. Carter] 
Yeah, yes, 
Ms. Kirton, I'm here.

435
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:50,250
Who are you?

436
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,773
Never mind.

437
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,644
It's critically
important that I--

438
00:28:53,688 --> 00:28:55,821
that I speak
to a Smoke or Lightnin,

439
00:28:55,864 --> 00:28:57,779
are they there with you now?

440
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,781
[Melody] 
They're right here with 
me, but you have to help us.

441
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,435
There's a crazy man chasing us

442
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:03,045
and I think 
he's trying to kill us.

443
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,047
Dogger's already on them,
we gotta move fast on this.

444
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,309
All right.
And Miss Kirton,

445
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:09,138
where
is the crazy man right now?

446
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:10,966
[Melody] He was chasing us with his car,

447
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,316
but then Lightnin got him to flip it over in the Everglades,

448
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,970
so he's not here now.

449
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,537
Can you help us?

450
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,625
What's going on Mr. Carter?

451
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:18,452
Ms. Kirton, calm down.

452
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,323
Yeah, I can help you.

453
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,979
but I must talk
to Smoke or Lightnin, right now.

454
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,807
Could you put
them on the line, please?

455
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,157
Take it.

456
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,682
Take it.

457
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:35,077
Hello, this is Lightnin,
go ahead.

458
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,688
Do you have any idea
the trouble you're in, son?

459
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,300
I mean, any idea at all?

460
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,562
A lot I bet?

461
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,477
Oh, yeah.
You bet right.

462
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,653
Except this time you bet
your life

463
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,089
[Mr. Carter] 
and the lives 
of your little friends too

464
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,700
and that's just for openers.

465
00:29:49,744 --> 00:29:51,398
I mean, we can add to that.

466
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:55,010
Grand larceny, impersonating a federal officer

467
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:59,145
theft of highly
classified government property.

468
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:01,669
I mean, 
with a little bit of luck,

469
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,845
a very lenient judge

470
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:07,109
and let's say
a spotless record,

471
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:09,198
you'll probably
get off in just a hair

472
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,113
under a hundred years.

473
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:13,115
Oh, my God.

474
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,638
Oh, yeah.

475
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,292
Now, hang on a second.

476
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,903
I mean,

477
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,730
Smoke only handcuffed
that briefcase to his arm

478
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:22,516
just so he can pick
up girls. I mean,

479
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,039
how did I know he was gonna
go ahead and do that.

480
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,041
Look,
stop talking and listen.

481
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,869
[Mr. Carter] 
Where 
is the briefcase right now?

482
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,002
It's right here.

483
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,917
Still handcuffed
to Smoke's wrist.

484
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,266
I don't think he's even
got the key.

485
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,833
[Mr. Carter] 
No, you don't

486
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:38,010
because I have the only
key because it's my briefcase

487
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:40,534
and thank your
lucky stars you didn't.

488
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:43,319
[Mr. Carter] 
If you even think 
about opening that case,

489
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:44,712
there won't be 
enough left of the three you

490
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,366
to bury in a wallet.

491
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,758
Now, do I have your attention?

492
00:30:47,802 --> 00:30:49,804
There are two very sensitive

493
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,719
anti-tampering devices

494
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,808
built into that briefcase.

495
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:58,030
[Lightnin] 
Okay, I'm from Florida.

496
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:00,380
I-- can you speak 
English, what does this mean?

497
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:01,816
What it means is,

498
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,209
that if you try to open it,

499
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,559
it's self-destructs.

500
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:07,126
Self-destruct?

501
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,258
Yes, as in explodes.

502
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:11,913
[Mr. Carter] 
And it also explodes 
if you tamper with the cuffs.

503
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,089
What else
is in this briefcase?

504
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,179
You said there was
two devices?

505
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:19,138
Oh, yes. The second one
I'm particularly proud of,

506
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,922
I had something to do
with inventing it.

507
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,577
It's called a shock sensor.

508
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,448
Now, all that means
to you is,

509
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,276
[Mr. Carter] 
if you bump it too hard,

510
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,323
that red light 
on top will start blinking,

511
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:31,933
now when that happens,

512
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:34,631
you and your friends 
have six hours to connect

513
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:36,764
with me and the key

514
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,200
or you can start
making reservations

515
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:41,247
for breakfast with Elvis.

516
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,945
Hey pal,
ain't looking good for you.

517
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:46,687
Now, please do not bump
that case very hard,

518
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,949
do you understand?

519
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,908
Yeah, we understand.

520
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,822
And what else
do you want us to do?

521
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:54,651
Cooperate.
Just do exactly as I say.

522
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,653
And when I get
my briefcase back

523
00:31:56,697 --> 00:31:59,091
[Mr. Carter] 
and I will get it 
back one way or the other,

524
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:01,876
we'll talk
and maybe just maybe

525
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,835
we'll work something out.

526
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:06,402
You sound like
my new best friend.

527
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:07,882
Oh, no kid, no.

528
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,362
I'm not your new best friend.

529
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:12,017
I am not even
sure if I like you.

530
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,758
[Mr. Carter] 
But until I get 
that briefcase back,

531
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:17,196
I'm the only friend you got.

532
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:19,067
[Mr. Carter] 
Now, are you ready 
to save your friend's asses?

533
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,504
Shoot.Lightnin.

534
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,419
Just kidding.

535
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:26,553
All right, look,
are you near a restaurant

536
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:28,033
or a store or a mall,

537
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,904
I would like some
place very public?

538
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,124
Yeah. We're--

539
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,474
Yes, just up
the highway on 334,

540
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,692
[Melody] 
there's this 
Country Restaurant.

541
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:38,652
334, 334, 334,

542
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,523
yeah I got it.

543
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,829
Yeah, that should be perfect.

544
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:43,004
And Ms. Kirton,
what I want you to do is,

545
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,659
I want you to go
there and wait for me.

546
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:47,400
[Mr. Carter] 
I don't want you 
to talk to anybody,

547
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,750
I don't even want you 
to breathe until I get there.

548
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,708
And, Ms. Kirton,

549
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:54,015
don't bump 
the briefcase too hard.

550
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,322
Do you understand?
Now, I'm on my way.

551
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:57,845
Wait a minute.
How are we going to know

552
00:32:57,888 --> 00:32:59,325
who you are?

553
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:02,719
You don't want to know
me, Ms. Kirton, trust me.

554
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:05,026
[Mr. Carter] 
Now, for some 
reason you can't make it,

555
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,941
meet me at the Gator Motel.

556
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,733
Chief, Carter here.

557
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:18,126
No, sir.

558
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,955
No,
I've located the briefcase.

559
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,913
I'm on my way
to retrieve it right now.

560
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:25,003
Yes, sir.

561
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:46,154
[Melody]
Oh, God.

562
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,200
You know, couldn't you
steal a car with gas in it?

563
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,940
Jeez.

564
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:59,994
I'm so tired.

565
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,822
Is this your sister's place?

566
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:06,740
No, it's my cousin's place.

567
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,524
Wow.

568
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:11,484
Take a look at this.

569
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,528
Lightnin, can you imagine
what you could do

570
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,356
with this car?

571
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,576
Imagine it is about
all you're going to do.

572
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,752
You guys are not stealing
another car.

573
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:21,494
Are you calling us thieves?

574
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,452
Oh, I'm sorry.

575
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,585
Did I hit a soft spot?

576
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:34,594
[Lightnin]
Cool, huh?

577
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,386
♪ She's got me
on the Ferris wheel ♪

578
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,388
♪ I'm so high
that I can't feel nothing ♪

579
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:49,217
♪ Until she
drops me down below ♪

580
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,351
I might have
to get you neutered.

581
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:53,917
It's like Fantasy Island.

582
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,919
Don't even think about it.

583
00:34:55,963 --> 00:34:57,921
That is my cousin
and one family member

584
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,445
mixed up with you two
is enough.

585
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:03,275
Hey, girl.

586
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:06,147
What are you doing here?

587
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,715
Good question.

588
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,760
What in the world
happened to y'all?

589
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,240
[Heather]
A bomb exploded in your car?

590
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:13,415
Another comedian,

591
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:16,679
it must run in the family genes.

592
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,551
Only bomb that went off

593
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,901
is these two.

594
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,772
No, seriously.
What happened?

595
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,775
Are you all right?Oh,

596
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,995
it's a long story.Excuse me ma'am.

597
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,216
That's all right.
I have all day.

598
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,782
Do you think
I could clean up,

599
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,437
maybe add some clothes
I could be on or something?

600
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,873
Of course.

601
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:40,181
What about those
two stink bombs?

602
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:42,488
[Melody] 
They can soak in dishwater.

603
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:43,793
The men's room
is right over there,

604
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:44,794
why don't you go grab
yourselves some napkins

605
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,579
to clean up with?

606
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:48,146
Thank you.

607
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,932
You're too kind.

608
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:53,151
Come on,
let's go in the back.

609
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,195
Excuse me miss,
do you think

610
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,414
I could pick
up my order now?

611
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:57,503
I've been waiting
for 20 minutes.

612
00:35:57,546 --> 00:35:58,939
[man]
You know,
I know you just work here.

613
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:01,724
I am so sorry,
I'll be right with you.

614
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,205
I just need a few minutes
to take care of the customers.

615
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:06,207
Okay.

616
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,253
You know, I've been coming
here for five years nowI am sorry.

617
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:10,037
and I have never been
served like this before.Okay, Rat,
what do you want?

618
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,517
Just tell
me what you want.

619
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,323
That's it.

620
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:39,022
I cannot stand
the suspense anymore.

621
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:41,242
Who is that blonde hunk

622
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:44,202
and tell me everything
in detail?

623
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:50,947
You think he's cute?

624
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,471
Honey, you know I have

625
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:55,300
a thing for blondes.

626
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:59,347
And those muscles.

627
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,788
So, what's his name?

628
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:09,096
Give it up.

629
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,924
Well,

630
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,622
he goes by Lightnin and--Uh-hmm.

631
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,324
His friend
calls himself Smoke.

632
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,284
So?

633
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:28,594
Give me details,
details.

634
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,900
Well,

635
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,425
I met them
at the safari club

636
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:36,079
and somehow I let them
talk me

637
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,211
into taking them
into this private party

638
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,866
I was going to.

639
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:41,389
The next thing I know,

640
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,957
there is this crazy guy
smashing his car into us.

641
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,527
How-- did you meet
these people?

642
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,268
Well, then
I found out that

643
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,792
they stole
a diplomat's car.

644
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,707
They stole
a diplomat's car?

645
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,536
God only knows what else
they've done.

646
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:00,278
Honey, I got
to meet you in there.

647
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:06,893
Hey, honey we're back.

648
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:09,156
Hello?Found some towels
in your bathroom.

649
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,201
Very clean bathroom.Very clean,

650
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:13,769
very clean, very clean.
Do you have any [indistinct]

651
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,032
Very cute, boys.

652
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,643
What, what-- I thought

653
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,166
it looked good,
didn't you?

654
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,690
Very good.Yes, yes.

655
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,305
Here you go.

656
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:31,047
Doesn't that look good?

657
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,313
You are kidding, right?

658
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,750
Do I look like
I'm kidding with you?

659
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,273
Besides this is all
you deserve after

660
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,535
what you put
my cousin through.

661
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:43,364
Well.Another good Samaritan.

662
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,888
And I supposed this comes
with M&M's

663
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,586
the kind that melt in your hands

664
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,718
and not in your mouth, right?

665
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:52,504
Actually, no.

666
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,897
It comes with this.

667
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:58,814
Crackers for two.

668
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:00,425
Wait, wait.

669
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:03,210
Why did she get that

670
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,560
and we only get this?

671
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,823
Because she is my cousin
and you are not.

672
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,348
That's right.

673
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:17,267
[Heather]
Pop quiz question for you.

674
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,966
What type of birds
don't fly?

675
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,927
I don't know.

676
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:27,452
Jail birds.

677
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:31,543
Y'all maybe ought to get
used to that.

678
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,469
Hey city boy

679
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,035
I hear the only
thing you're good for

680
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,516
is driving fast,
is that true?

681
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,083
It depends
on what I'm driving.

682
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:51,650
Now, why do you think

683
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:54,217
they call him Lightnin?

684
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,396
But I could think
of a few good reasons.

685
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,095
And what's that
supposed to mean?

686
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:03,096
Oh, come on Smokie,

687
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:06,142
don't play innocent with me.

688
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:07,796
Aren't you two at least
bit embarrassed

689
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,538
pretending
like you're secret agents?

690
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:13,498
And get rid of that stupid
briefcase.

691
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,586
Y'all should grow up.

692
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:16,370
Well, we can't.

693
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,676
There is a bomb in there.

694
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,938
And if we mess
with it'll blow up.

695
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,679
Uh-hmm.[Melody]
Oh, shit.

696
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,202
What?

697
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:23,769
I forgot my money
and my personnal stuff

698
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,292
in the car.

699
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:27,903
Well, I would not worry
about it now.

700
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:31,385
Besides since when
is the girl have to pay?

701
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,344
With these guys?

702
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,697
What?

703
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,742
Well what are you looking
at me for?

704
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,832
I spent all my money
on the drinks, remember?

705
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,965
Lightnin.

706
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:48,446
Oh, no.

707
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:03,852
Listen, I, uh...

708
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,158
I just want to say
that I'm sorry

709
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,291
for anything that
happened and, uh...

710
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,076
look, Smoke and I will,

711
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,643
we'll go sit over there
and we'll eat and leave,

712
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:15,516
we won't bother you
anymore.

713
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,910
It's all right,
it wasn't that bad.
