1
00:02:10,377 --> 00:02:15,007
I looked up all the documents from
before you were adopted.

2
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,412
Before you were adopted,

3
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,950
you were reported as an orphan.

4
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,919
I went to the neighborhood and asked around.

5
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:32,525
Luckily, there was a woman who remembered you.

6
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:41,371
Thank you very much.
I'll never forget your help.

7
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:47,043
Hey, you bitch!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

8
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:51,081
Pay up...
Let go, you bitch!

9
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:55,816
Why you, bitch!
You're stealing a zipper that's only a dollar?

10
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:59,082
Is this the way you sew on a zipper?

11
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:02,654
Of course, this is the way!
How else, bitch?

12
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:16,565
She's the one I told you about!

13
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:44,095
Ugh...dumb, fat bitch...huh.

14
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:49,936
Scratching a person's face like this.

15
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:58,974
Hello.

16
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,549
This is the man I told you about.

17
00:04:10,764 --> 00:04:15,963
Then...this is...Jin-woo?
Yes.

18
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,285
I wanted to see you because

19
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:36,252
there's something you should know.

20
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,396
Sit, sit here.

21
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,999
I was hoping to have this time with you some day.

22
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,045
It's a long story...

23
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:14,382
Today, commentator Bang speaks
about the Kwangjoo incident.

24
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,457
Hello. This is Young-jin Bang

25
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,197
Today, I'd like to talk about

26
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:21,359
the military that has entered Kwangjoo.

27
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:25,200
The difficulties the military had

28
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:28,036
in stabilizing the crisis is well known.

29
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:32,140
The military under martial law worked hard

30
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:35,204
to bring it under control.

31
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,942
It is well understood that it was

32
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,918
hard for the military to protect

33
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:46,858
the innocent majority of Kwangjoo
who are citizens of this country.

34
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:53,224
Thus the army acted cautiously.

35
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:57,696
We will not forget their endeavors.

36
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,030
The Martial Law headquarters released

37
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:02,371
its report on the Kwangjoo riot today.

38
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,673
According to the report,

39
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,742
there were 33 main instigators,

40
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:10,745
30 who attacked the prisons,
33 looters who also set fires,

41
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:15,353
174 who left the main party,
10 who spread rumors,

42
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,920
and 74 who participated in demonstrations or riot

43
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:47,849
"The river is flowing...Underneath
the Third Han Bridge..."

44
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:39,995
Hey

45
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,765
Did you see the guy who moved
into the second floor?

46
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,435
He looks real elegant

47
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:51,573
His fingers are white and really long

48
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,744
What good are pretty hands, you fool

49
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,882
Look at Kyung-chul. He easily makes
10 bucks a day.

50
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,020
Ugh...whatever. Who cares if he's a good worker

51
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,087
You crazy bitch!
Then what's great about pretty hands?

52
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,226
What's he gonna use them for

53
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:14,092
You haven't got a clue...A fool,
that's what you are.

54
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:19,029
Ki-ok, all you do is curse

55
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:19,970
Stop it.

56
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:21,933
It's irritating.

57
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,140
Huh! Am I wrong?

58
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:27,909
It's not like his thing is pretty.

59
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:30,639
Who cares about his hands, right?

60
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:35,546
Ki-ok! You do know something, don't you?

61
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,154
You go, girl!

62
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:42,251
Ugh...I'm sick of this neighborhood

63
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:43,392
I've gotta get out of here.

64
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,726
So let's get out together, okay?

65
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,467
They say the discomfort index is high today.

66
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:35,968
But I can't tell.

67
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:40,003
Just like I don't know about pleasure,

68
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,244
I don't know about discomfort either.

69
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:49,912
I'm just used to this space.

70
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,359
I couldn't take such humid weather before.

71
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:38,464
But once you get used to it,
it feels comfortable.

72
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,337
That's life for me.

73
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:49,843
The fact that there's nothing for me
to do is also comfortable.

74
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:53,516
I just have to live.

75
00:12:55,888 --> 00:13:01,656
It's okay to just feel alive every now and then

76
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:20,721
So many fucking bills.
And no one who cares. Damnit...

77
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,218
You should've told me before if it fell out

78
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:44,793
You gotta take care of these things right away

79
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,994
I fixed it good now.

80
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:52,369
When are you going to paint this?
Soon.

81
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:04,609
Damnit! Get over here!
Oh...at it again, those crazyfools.

82
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:10,151
Hurry, it's your move

83
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,287
Why are you so slow

84
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:28,635
What kind of move is that

85
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,239
Who says you're a great player,huh?
Move your 'cha, cha,'...

86
00:20:32,278 --> 00:20:35,042
What do you mean 'cha?' I win if I do this

87
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:44,015
Give it, give it

88
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:45,853
The girls at the teahouse in front

89
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,854
they smoke really cool.

90
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:51,860
How

91
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:53,394
Look at you..

92
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:58,469
But where do you hide your ciggies?
My cigarettes?

93
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:00,864
Wo

94
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,435
Plan on working at a match factory

95
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,702
Let me see.
What the hell...

96
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,011
Damnit! I stepped on shit! Fuck

97
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,257
What's the ring for

98
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:23,787
You know. It's Detective Im's son's first birthday

99
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,763
He has all the luck

100
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:27,689
Gets promoted..

101
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:37,802
You know what

102
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,141
I think I'm gonna get my job back soon

103
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,979
They know I took the fall for them

104
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:47,247
that I didn't do it.

105
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,226
Just wait a little.
They said they'd call me back

106
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,927
Our troubles are over

107
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:06,137
We'll live like we used to

108
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:07,837
I'm confident

109
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:09,941
Just be patient

110
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,004
We'll get out of this shitty neighborhood...

111
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:31,055
"Who said love was beautiful..."

112
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:47,403
"Rather, rather...Put me to sleep with
your empty hands."

113
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,062
I went to a friend's house yesterday

114
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:09,493
His sister was sleeping

115
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:19,941
I put my hands under her skirt

116
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:26,411
Crazy bastard

117
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:39,060
Who the hell

118
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:41,488
I'll kill you

119
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:54,944
You! It was you, right? Stupid bastard

120
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:02,913
Look! Look! Crazy bastard...Damnit..

121
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:05,347
Shit

122
00:25:37,616 --> 00:25:39,049
Who put this..

123
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:50,427
Wait till I get my hands on you..

124
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,798
Fresh cabbages

125
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:59,260
Fresh cabbages from Kangwon

126
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:05,672
If I catch the bastard,
I'll stick his head in the can.

127
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:09,443
What kind of sick pig peeks at that?
Exactly.

128
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:11,807
Hey, are you talking to us

129
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:16,553
Mr. Park, I beg you,
change the bathroom door.

130
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,345
Why me

131
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:25,196
Plus, today's a holiday.
Why'd you come here?

132
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:28,427
Why don't you go use your own bathroom...

133
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,125
I won't mention names but there's a pric

134
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,770
who's ruining the neighborhood

135
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:37,502
You can't even take a dump
in our own neighborhood.

136
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:40,268
When I catch him, I'll fuck his life up good

137
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:43,776
What? Fuck his life up?
Don't talk like that, Ki-ok

138
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:48,514
Fuck up his life cause he saw her take a dump

139
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,884
Is that a thing to say

140
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:55,322
I'm not being mean.
That's how the world is today.

141
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:59,758
Say the wrong thing and they'll tear you apart

142
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:03,163
Peeking into the bathroom,
that's a crime! A big one!

143
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:07,496
I'm...I'm... Young-mi

144
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,398
What was that in the papers a few days back

145
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,475
Immoral behavior?

146
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:16,973
The thing that they're trying to set an example with?

147
00:27:17,282 --> 00:27:20,581
That's it! Immoral behavior!
Set an example.

148
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,584
What? What? What'd you say

149
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,253
Well, you know...l don't wanna be

150
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,883
to mean living in the same neighborhood.

151
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,026
But there's a bastard who doesn't seem to get it

152
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:34,428
And if that's the case,
you're part of the problem, too.

153
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,691
Boy, you're so smart, aren't you

154
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:39,062
I don't get a word you said.

155
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,628
What? Set what

156
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,506
Set an example!
You don't need to get it all.

157
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,301
If you don't want to be dragged of

158
00:27:46,345 --> 00:27:48,108
and tortured then watch out.

159
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,471
It's a scary world right now

160
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:53,211
Let's go. Peeking into the bathroom...

161
00:27:53,418 --> 00:28:01,382
What? What? Torture?
Man...She's so full of herself...

162
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:48,489
These mosquitoes are driving me crazy

163
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,899
Why aren't you sleeping? Come here

164
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:58,500
I'm gonna steam some yams

165
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,735
Don't pee there. Go overthere

166
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:16,310
"My love who has left me"

167
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:23,821
"if I could only meet him today..."

168
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:33,623
"With my tired lips, I can tell you all about it."

169
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,597
Where is everybody

170
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:49,069
"...I've lived, unaware of the world."

171
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,831
How far are you going to follow me

172
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:14,468
Wanna go see the circus?
I happen to have two tickets.

173
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:16,698
No thanks

174
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:18,842
Can I see your place?
No!

175
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:27,243
Oh...how about tomorrow night at 8

176
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,016
Okay

177
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:43,392
"The river is flowing..."

178
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,252
Cut it out

179
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:07,254
"I'm so...fucking embarrassed."

180
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:09,191
Hey! What is that

181
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:12,095
Do we always gotta listen to country

182
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,598
Let's get some culture.

183
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:17,995
Crazy bastard. Do you even know the title

184
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:22,765
You making fun of me

185
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:28,011
It was as popular as Paul Anka, Diana

186
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,005
Do you even know that

187
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:35,047
"I'm so...fucking embarrassed."

188
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:37,211
Sure, no matter what you spit out

189
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:39,689
no bitch here can understand you.

190
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:43,357
We have nothing to do with English
except for 'thank you.'

191
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,190
What

192
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:49,959
What

193
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:55,501
I'm telling you it's something like Diana

194
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,608
Are you crazy? Hey

195
00:39:59,777 --> 00:40:01,369
Polka Inca, Diamond, whatever

196
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:03,937
what the hell are you throwing at me

197
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:08,250
Damnit... Hey! Pick that up! Pick it up

198
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:15,154
Well...you were laughing at me...That's why..

199
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,237
I'm out of here

200
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:30,032
Hey! Where are you going

201
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,669
What are the torture camps doing?
Not taking that one...

202
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:36,678
What did you say? Bitch...

203
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,147
You brat, you out of your mind

204
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:41,516
We've a big load to send out in two days

205
00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:48,248
Did you even do your job

206
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,930
Kyung-chul.
Yes.

207
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:56,763
Is this a dance hall

208
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,497
What are you doing

209
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:03,434
Stop being full of yourself and

210
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:05,442
undo these stitches, will ya?

211
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,598
I'm sorry. It's just that..

212
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:43,863
...you're so beautiful.

213
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:46,839
It was you the last time too, wasn't it?

214
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,672
You always look so lonely

215
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:12,388
Why doesn't your husband look at you

216
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:17,550
How do you know that

217
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:24,766
Overthere

218
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,393
I'm sorry I couldn't make it last time

219
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,228
I had to work overtime.

220
00:50:56,567 --> 00:50:58,660
Do you work in the factory out front

221
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,064
I'm just a low-level worker right now

222
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:02,529
but one day, I'll have my own store

223
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,301
I have a savings account, too. In a few years,
I'll have enough.

224
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:09,944
I'm different from the people around here

225
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,211
Some thread here...
What are you doing?

226
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,717
It must've gotten there at work. I had to do a lot today

227
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:22,815
Do I have any on my back

228
00:51:23,794 --> 00:51:26,456
Yes...
Could you take them off?.

229
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:29,426
Sure
