00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:08,245
<i>My beautiful Mavis</i>

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,331
<i>With Daddy you will stay...</i>

3
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:12,540
<i>TALES OF HUMANS</i>

4
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,877
<i>And if a human tries to harm you...</i>

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,420
<i>I'll simply say...</i>

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,918
AARRGHH!!

7
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,716
<i>Because you're Daddy's girl</i>

8
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:27,597
Ever since she was born,
I wanted to protect my little Ghoul...

9
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,557
So I created a place

10
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:32,018
where all monsters could be safe...

11
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:33,353
from them !

12
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:35,397
Humans hate us !

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,275
They're vicious
and they're very loud !

14
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:39,367
THIS AUTUMN

15
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:41,319
Dad, everyone's here is ancient.

16
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:42,821
N-27.

17
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,031
N-27

18
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:46,700
I wanna go out and see the world.

19
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,285
Woa woa woa, honey, you're too young!

20
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,078
I'm 118 years old.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,080
Don't give me the powdy bat face.

22
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,583
This is Hotel Transylvania.

23
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,793
All our monster friends are right here!

24
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,420
The Mummy.

25
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,380
Wayne the wolf.

26
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:03,216
Yeah, it's a mess back there.

27
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,052
And your uncle Frank's
dropping in too.

28
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:11,349
Housekeeping!

29
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,385
AN UNINVITED GUEST

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,603
Hello?

31
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:16,730
A human!

32
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,187
How did you find this place?

33
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:20,154
Oh, I was just mountain climbing
with some dudes

34
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:22,569
and heard this story
about an awesome castle.

35
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:25,989
Speaking of awesome,
that cape thing is killing it!

36
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,632
A MONSTER PROBLEM

37
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,367
Look at these cool costumes!

38
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:31,286
Check it out, I'm a Franken-homie !

39
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:32,952
Wow, what's your name?

40
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:33,830
My name is Mavis.

41
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,448
Drac's daughter is in love with...

42
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:36,465
A Human !

43
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,929
[LAUGHING]

44
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,170
Go to a corner, you're in a time-out!

45
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:41,254
I'm a grown man!

46
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:46,635
Seriously, Dad.

47
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,678
PACK YOUR BAGS

48
00:01:49,346 --> 00:01:51,431
- You are coming with us.
- I'm staying!

49
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:53,308
Oh! Why did that hurt me?

50
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,011
GET AWAY

51
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:56,394
Out of the way, grand-pa!
Stay away from my daughter!

52
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:57,892
REST IN PEACE

53
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,005
I think your Dad's
really starting to like me.

54
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:04,194
Hi...

55
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:06,988
Hotel Transylvania

56
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:10,450
Now go and never return.

57
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,953
Wait. Never return to the hotel?

58
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,487
I've just used my powers
to erase your memory.

59
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:17,290
I looked straight into your eyes!

60
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,138
- Oh, maybe it's the contact lenses.
- Your what?

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,970
Yeah, let me just try and
get them out real quick.

62
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,630
Oh, that is the most disgusting
thing that I've ever seen!

63
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:24,839
I almost got it.
