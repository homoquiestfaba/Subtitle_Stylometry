00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,591
[doctor] Okay, Ally, breathe in.

00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:19,122
[pressing keys]

00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,906
[doctor]
And a nice slow breath out.

7
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:34,006
That's great. One more time.

8
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,751
[exhales]

00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,289
[sighs]

10
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,509
[Nelson] I can't find that guy's
cousin's phone number.

11
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,467
Ryan!

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,209
Ryan!

13
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:06,517
Sorry, man. Sorry.
I got to get going.

14
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,304
All right.
Well, go ahead, you know.

15
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:11,479
Tell her good luck, all right?

16
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,263
-Give her my best.
-Will do.

17
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,661

00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:28,060
[clears his throat]

19
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,105
[Ally] Doc.

20
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:30,933
Please.

21
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,241
I'm afraid it's not good news.

22
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:38,375
Your kidney function
isn't improving.

23
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,638
Wait. I thought that by
increasing the treatments,

24
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:41,944
we would get more time.

25
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:45,034
Not always.
Again, I am... I'm sorry.

26
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,516
Okay, what's next?

27
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:53,869
Well, unless you have family or
friends that we haven't tested.

28
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,480
We've tried everyone.

29
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,309
Then, I'm afraid,
we're out of options.

30
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,790
That's not good enough.

31
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,660
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,186
How long do I have?

33
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,840
At best two months.

34
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,320
Where are we on the donor list?

35
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,279
It's a four-to-six-year wait.

36
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,629
Unfortunately,
not an option at this point.

37
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,894
It's time to get
your affairs in order.

38
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:22,071
Hey...

39
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm not giving up.

00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,716
-[woman] See.
-Frozen one.

43
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,023
-[woman] That wasn't so bad.
-[man] Gracias.

44
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,852
[woman] This could really
be helpful to your families.

45
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,377
Everything good?

46
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,770
Everything is perfect.

47
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:09,858
Great.

48
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:25,177
Where are you right now?

49
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,833
I'm right here.

50
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:34,274
We fought...

51
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,800
It just didn't go our way.

52
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:42,194
No, we keep fighting
till the end.

53
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:47,287
-This is the end.
-No. There's still time.

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,638
-Ryan.
-There's still time!

55
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,204
[steps approaching]

56
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:55,120
Sorry.

57
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,209
-So many things.
-No, that's okay.

58
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,820
All right.

59
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,391
So, you're still going
to get dinner out.

60
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:05,696
Yeah.

61
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,221
Okay, I forgot some things
over in the office.

62
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,614
Do you need anything?

63
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:11,833
A new kidney.

64
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:15,619
[Ally laughs]

65
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,153

67
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:45,823
I'm scared.

68
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,259
[Kate sobs]

69
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:49,914
Me too.

70
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,356
[Kate sighs]

71
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,359
Enough tears.
Tell me about this new guy.

72
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,534
Ben.

73
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,926
Ben is a good name.

74
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,582
-[laughing] It's not important.
-Yes, it is.

75
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,541
I need to get my looks in now.

76
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,412
See if he's good enough
for my little sis.

77
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:14,809
He seems really
thoughtful and... caring.

78
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,506
He's really sweet.

79
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,551
What does he do?

80
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:18,682
He's a lawyer.

81
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,641
-Strike one.
-[laughs]

82
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:23,383
No, he's one of the good ones.
He works at the DA's office.

83
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,777
I'll have Ryan
run a check on him.

84
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,257
[laughs]

85
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:38,136
[hospital murmuring]

86
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,140
-[nurse] Excuse me.
-Here to see Doctor Hayworth.

87
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,403
[nurse] He's right that way.

88
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,974
[speaker] Doctor Jackson, meet
Doctor Jones in the E.R.

[door opening]

90
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:53,543
Ryan.

91
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,589
I need a minute.

92
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:57,808
Is Ally with you?

93
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,115
No.

94
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,860
Well, have a seat.

95
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:12,606
There was an article
in the news a while back.

96
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,218
It was the UCLA scandal
with the Yakuza crime boss
who needed a kidney.

97
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,655
Do you remember that?

98
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,004
Uh, yeah, but--

99
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,702
He bought his way
to the top of the list, right?

100
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,748
So, don't tell me
that we're out of options.

101
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,491
I need you to help me
save my wife.

102
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,406
[sighs] Ryan...

103
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,366

104
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,933
Twelve years in law enforcement.

105
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,937
I have seen some things.

106
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,332
I've learned.

107
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,335
Tell me what you need.

108
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,034
I have access to resources.
You need money? Drugs?

109
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,471
I can make things go away.

110
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,646
Just tell me,
what it's going to take?

111
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,996
-Ryan, stop.
-I know there's a way,

112
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,432
-There's always a way.
-Stop!

113
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,959
You... you just have
to have faith in the system.

114
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,962
Are you kidding me? The system?
The system is broken!

115
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:07,182
She's got months not years.
You said it yourself.

116
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,184
You can't lose hope.

117
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,490
Hope?

118
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,970
We're past that, okay?
It's time for action!

119
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,112
Doc... please,
I'm asking you for help.

120
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,810
What you're asking me
to do is unethical.

121
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:28,029
Not to mention illegal.

122
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,944
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,078
There's nothing more
that I can do.

124
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:38,822
It's not over. No.

125
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,215
I'm not giving up on her.

126
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,696
I'm not saying that you should.

127
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,098
[speaker] Doctor Craig
with Doctor Jackson...

128
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,145

00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:22,779
[Anthony] Hey, man!

131
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:26,522
What do you want?

132
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,480
I can help you.

133
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,746
Your situation, I can help.

134
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:33,964
You know I'm a cop, right?

135
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:37,838
I know who you are...
you and your wife.

136
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:40,101
-Doctor Hayworth--
-Look, do you want help or not?

137
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,712
-Yeah. Yes.
-Okay.

138
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,933
Call this number.

139
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,195
They'll do what they can.

140
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,067
Wait a minute. Who are you?

141
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,373
Just call the number.

142
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,995

00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:19,140
Are you okay?

[grunts]

149
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,799
Had some new meds.

150
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,017
I'll get you some water.

151
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:32,762

152
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,506

[Ally gasping]

154
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,693
[Ryan] Here you go.

155
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:52,826
[Ally] I can't do this.

156
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,958
[sobs]

157
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:04,228
What good are an extra couple
weeks if they are like this?

158
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,403
I can't.

159
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:09,799
[Ally cries]

160
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,108
Maybe you don't have to.

161
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,503
[Ally cries]

162
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,462
What if there was
another option, Ally?

163
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,205
We find the donor ourselves.

164
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:32,648
Ryan...

165
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:35,956
No.

166
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:41,701
This isn't just about you,
you know.

167
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,967
I have a number.

168
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:51,754
Let's just see
what they have to say.

169
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,192
That's all.
We don't have to do it.

170
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,064
[Ryan cries]

171
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:06,726
[crying] Please, Ally.
Just do this for me, okay?

172
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:16,648
Okay.

173
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,608
[Ryan cries]

174
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,742
Oh. Thank you.

-Yes.

178
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:34,797
-[Dolan] Good to meet you.
-[Ryan] Me, too.

179
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,321
-Thank you.
-My wife.

180

James Dolan.

181
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,327
It's very nice
to meet you, Allison.

182
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,764
Ally is fine.

183
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,679
-Have a seat right here.
-Thank you.

184
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,248
So, how does this work?

185
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,774
[sighs] Straight to the point.

186
00:12:56,514 --> 00:13:00,431
Well you-- uh, I'm sure
you already know the stats.

187
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:03,826
The thousands of people
that die every year
while waiting for a donor.

188
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,483
You see, US law states
that a donor must be a relative,

189
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:12,095
a spouse, or donating
for reasons of affection.

190
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,968
Making what you do illegal.

191
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:19,494
Well, let's just say it doesn't
leave much wiggle room
for people like yourself.

192
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:23,063
People whose lives
are literally on the line.

195
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:33,377
passed away two days
before my 18th birthday.

196
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:35,466

197
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,167
For five years, I watched...

198
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:44,824

to a shallower form of herself.

200
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,351
We're sorry to hear that.

201
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,877
I was top my class
at Harvard Law.

202
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:58,011
And, I I've learned
the system from the inside out
in hopes of changing it.

203
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,621
And, when it comes
to donating organs,

204
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,753
let me tell you,
the system is broken.

205
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,975
I couldn't spend another
day working in a system

206
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,369
that shuts out people in need,

207
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,239
like yourself...

208
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:11,894
or my mother.

209
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:14,941
I...

210
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,946
I carried the anger of losing
her inside of me for years,
not knowing what to do.

211
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,906
Now, let me do this.

212
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,604
So, I don't regret it,
not for a minute,

213
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,957

actually makes a difference.

How long does the process take?

216
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,747
Well, first, we need
to identify a match.

217
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,012
And once that's done, we can go
ahead and schedule your surgery.

218
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:46,407
Well, how long does that
take to identify a match?

219
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,974
Well, I make no promises,

220
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,758
but I'm fairly confident

221
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,716
we can have your wife
prepped and ready to go
within the month.

222
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:57,200
And it could be sooner,
depending on availability.

223
00:14:57,244 --> 00:15:00,812
Doctor Hayworth said
it would take months
for me to climb the donor list.

224
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,772
Now, you're sitting
in my living room,

225
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:07,515
telling me I could have
transplant surgery
within the month?

226
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,126
What's wrong with this picture?

227
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,608
Look, I'm sure
your doctor is a fine man

228
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,523
and a competent physician.

229
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,918
And if you want
to follow his advice,
I say, "Go with God.

I say, "Go with me."

My company delivers
a product to the consumer

Within the next
five to ten years,

the laws for the organ trade
will be revised.

243

And this exact transaction
will be legal.

for you to sacrifice your life

who's a detective, right?

710
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:03,484
Yes. I'm not concerned
about myself, but the less
he's involved the better.

711
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:07,923
But I'm going to need
first-hand evidence
implicating broker, sellers,

712
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,449
and a complete understanding
of the infrastructure
to build a proper case.

713
00:53:11,492 --> 00:53:12,493
Yeah. I'm working on that.

714
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:15,061
I'm sorry.

715
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:19,631
Isn't that more your husband's
area of expertise?

716
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:21,589
I'm just gathering some data

717
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:24,505
being as I am the one
who went through the process.

718
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:25,376
Of course.

719
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:29,467
You know, there may also be
some considerations

720
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,600
for testifying and helping
the city put the case together.

721
00:53:32,644 --> 00:53:34,994
I could send you over
some basic legal guidelines.

722
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:37,866
You could sit down
with your family and discuss
how you want to move forward.

723
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:38,867
Thanks, Ben.

724
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,219
Well, let's just let you
get some rest then.

725
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,437
-[Ben] Yeah.
-Okay.

726
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:47,180
Thank you again.

727
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,790
-My pleasure.
-It's a pleasure.

728
00:53:49,748 --> 00:53:51,706
Let me know if you need
anything. Okay?

729
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,142
[Ally] I will. I will. I will.

730
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,538
[Ben] Thank you.

731
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:01,238
[whispering] He's cute.

732
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:10,203
[grunts]

733
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:40,538
Hey, you!

734
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:43,932
Hey, sorry. Go back to sleep.

735
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:46,544
It's okay.

736
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:48,546
Nice choice
of reading materials.

737
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:52,854
How was your day?

738
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,030
Not great.

739
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:00,688
What happened?

740
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,302
This thing that we did, I...

741
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,653
I don't know how to--

742
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:11,133
[sighs]

743
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:12,657
It's just always there.

744
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:16,182
It's 'cause you're
one of the good guys.

745
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,187
Her name is Rosa Garcia.

746
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,711
Seventeen.

747
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,281
Her father came in
and identified her body today.

748
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:31,066
It broke my heart.

749
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:37,159
Why did he let her do it?

750
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:38,900
I don't know.

751
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,641
He's not talking.

752
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,382
[sighs]

753
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,079
I know it's hard for you,

754
00:55:45,298 --> 00:55:47,344
but I have to do something.

755
00:55:51,783 --> 00:55:53,088
I understand.

756
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,832
You shouldn't have
to do it alone.

757
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:04,535
So, why don't you show me
everything you have
and we'll do it together.

758
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:09,757
Thank you.

759
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:10,889
I know.

760
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,984
Most of my research is
in a folder on the coffee table.

761
00:56:20,115 --> 00:56:23,336
Okay. I'll bring it in
to work tomorrow.

762
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,468
See what I can do.

763
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:29,386
I think it all centers around
a church near Huntington Park.

764
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:31,779
Church?

765
00:56:33,825 --> 00:56:35,740
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's a cover.

766
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:39,787
Okay, get some rest.

767
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:40,788
I'll be right in.

768
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:56,064
[Dolan] So?

769
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:58,284
She's been doing some digging?

770
00:56:58,327 --> 00:57:00,504
-Not the husband?
-Doesn't seem like it.

771
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:02,070
She was alone at the hospital.

772
00:57:02,114 --> 00:57:04,116
It won't be good
for him if this came out.

773
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,292
She says she's working
with the DA on this.

774
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,599
-Seriously?
-That's what Anthony says.

775
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,427
Huh, I'll find out.

776
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,385
Well, what should we do?

777
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,171
Business as usual.

778
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:20,349
It's time to pay Mrs. Graves
a follow-up visit.

779
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:28,096
[knocks on the door]

780
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,796
[suspenseful music]

781
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:14,316
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

782
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,756
This is pretty thorough stuff.

783
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,632
[Ben sighs] I'm off.

784
00:58:25,676 --> 00:58:27,416
-I'll check in this afternoon.
-Okay.

785
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:30,332
I want another one.

786
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,422
-One more.
-[laughs]

787
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:41,648
[suspenseful music]

788
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,375
[knocks on the door]

789
00:59:25,866 --> 00:59:27,476
Mister Dolan.

790
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,608
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

791
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,306
I wasn't expecting you.

792
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:32,917
Oh, standard follow-up.

793
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,310
Just want to make sure
everything's taking.
Do you mind?

794
00:59:35,354 --> 00:59:36,529
Don't mind my associate.

795
00:59:41,969 --> 00:59:44,406
Can I get you anything?
Tea? Coffee?

796
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,843
No, no. We're fine.

797
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:48,280
-Excuse the mess.
-Oh, please.

798
00:59:49,324 --> 00:59:50,978
[Dolan sighs]

799
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:57,463
So, how are you feeling?

800
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:02,294
I'm doing well.

801
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:04,122
Getting stronger and stronger
each day.

802
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:05,950
Excellent!

803
01:00:05,993 --> 01:00:07,778
Now, have you been
to see the doctor to get
the proper prescription?

804
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:10,476
Yes.

805
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,086
Because most of these
won't take without
the proper medication.

806
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:14,219
I'm covered. Thanks.

807
01:00:14,262 --> 01:00:15,394
Good.

808
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,353
Wow! Do you remember
what it was like

809
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:21,269
when you had no hope
and no alternatives?

810
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:24,621
Such a scary place.

811
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,931
I mean, that makes you realize
how important it is to be...

812
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:34,021
to be grateful for what we have.

813
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:37,634
-Don't you agree?
-I do.

814
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:41,594
Well, then.
Everything is as it should be.

815
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,379
Another satisfied customer.

816
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:46,077
[chuckles]

817
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:48,906
No wait.

818
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:52,779
There is just one little thing
we need to clear off.

819
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:57,175
And I'll speak plainly so there
can be no misunderstanding.

820
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:01,527
Accidents happen.

821
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:04,225
That's all this was.

822
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:09,753
Now, an accident can be tragic
and difficult to deal with,

823
01:01:09,796 --> 01:01:13,670
but it's called an accident
because it's out of our control.

824
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,935
Unfortunately, it's the price
of doing business.

825
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:20,502
Understand?

826
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:23,680
Good.

827
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:25,203
So, no more digging,

828
01:01:26,204 --> 01:01:29,424
no more threatening the people,
who helped save your life.

829
01:01:31,296 --> 01:01:32,689
It's so disrespectful.

830
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,650
[laughing] The DA.

831
01:01:39,086 --> 01:01:40,044
Really?

832
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,482
Well, we both know that's a lie.

833
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,355
Consider this a warning. Okay?

834
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:55,712
Good.

835
01:01:57,757 --> 01:02:00,020
You should focus
on your recovery.

836
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,721
Forget the past.
Look to the future.

837
01:02:05,939 --> 01:02:07,071
Okay.

838
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:12,032
Well, then. I think we've
taken up enough of your time.

839
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:15,514
You have a wonderful
rest of the day.

840
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:37,188
What are you doing?

841
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:39,973
I thought this was
something else.

842
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:41,105
It's not.

843
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:43,672
You've been looking
through it all morning.

844
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:47,851
Maybe.

845
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:55,597
Seems like there is a little
something to do with our case.

846
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,339
Is there something
you want to tell me?

847
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:04,084
No. Not really.

848
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:07,044
We got company here.

849
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:09,786
This guy's dressed
too nice to be a cop.

850
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:11,526
-Detective Graves?
-Yeah.

851
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:14,007
ADA Martin. Can I have a word?

852
01:03:14,051 --> 01:03:16,096
We'll go right on out there.

853
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:29,501
Kate brought me over to have
a conversation with Ally.

854
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,373
Look, you're so far gone,
you don't even know
who you're dealing with.

855
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:35,812
What?

856
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:38,684
The Milano crime family.

857
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:41,078
James Dolan is Dominic Pino,
a major earner.

858
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:42,775
We've had him
in our sights for years.

859
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:46,997
You've seen one of his
operations from the inside.

860
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,825
Find someone you can flip

861
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:50,827
and we'll do everything
we can to keep you
and your wife out of it.

862
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:53,568
All right.

863
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:57,834
Hey.

864
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,533
-[elevator's bell]
-Thank you.

865
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:11,935
So?

866
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,860
There's something
I have to tell you.

867
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:34,653
[suspenseful music]

868
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:17,783
[Ally] Nothing. Thanks.

869
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:21,134
How'd you find me?

870
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,616
I looked up the bars
closest to your place.

871
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,923
You know there are two
that are much closer.

872
01:05:29,186 --> 01:05:30,665
I like the ambiance.

873
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:35,540
Does that help with the guilt?

874
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,064
Ask me in an hour.

875
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:42,503
What went wrong?

876
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:48,074
This can't be worth it.

877
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:51,251
-What do you want?
-I need your help.

878
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:53,558
Lady, my job is done.

879
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:57,562
She was only seventeen.
This has got to stop.

880
01:05:57,605 --> 01:05:59,694
Now that you have
your kidney, of course.

881
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,220
If I could do it again...

882
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:06,049
-I'd--
-Have died.

883
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,879
If it wasn't you, it would
have been someone else.

884
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:18,017
I have to do something.

885
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:20,672
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

886

892
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:48,743

Excuse me, I'm looking
for Doctor Hayworth.

Was his office moved?

01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,151
No. He was transferred, I think.

934
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,328
There was a nurse, an orderly.
His name was Anthony.
