1
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:28,336
It was the summer of 1965.

2
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:32,374
I was 15 and my life
was already falling apart.

3
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:35,276
So I came back to Hungary...

4
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,278
Where it all began.

5
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,997
Budapest in the '50s.

6
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:48,232
The cold war.

7
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:53,254
Hungary was under the rule
of Stalin and Rakosi.

8
00:02:53,322 --> 00:02:55,857
My father used to say
this was a time...

9
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,976
When everybody he knew was
either in jail or going to jail.

10
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,179
Or worse.

11
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,735
Margit.

12
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,112
Peter.

13
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:27,804
Peter.

14
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,229
Helen.

15
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,494
Helen.

16
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:40,052
Good morning.
Good morning.

17
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,054
How are you?

18
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:45,357
How are you? I am fine, thank you. How are you?

19
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:48,594
I am very fine.
Good morning.

20
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:54,866
Good morning. Good morning. How are you?

21
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:57,203
I am fine.
Oh, she's fine!

22
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:07,913
Choose.

23
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,450
That.

24
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:30,436
Where do you think Zsuzsi
is right now?

25
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:40,445
Here's the hotel.

26
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:45,550
Thank you.
Very grateful.

27
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:58,280
<i>Excuse me, sir. Where does
one apply for the visas?</i>

28
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,349
This is the right one.
Inside?

29
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,917
You must go to the end of
the queue. This line here?

30
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:04,919
Okay, thank you, sir,
very much.

31
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,564
Is Zsuzsi coming today?

32
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,633
Tonight they are coming.

33
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,236
But it won't be
before you go to sleep.

34
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:23,738
Won't it be nice to wake up
to your little sister?

35
00:17:23,806 --> 00:17:25,740
Yes.

36
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,320
Good day, madame.
It's for you.

37
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,322
Thank you.

38
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,284
Mama?

39
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,887
Mama!

40
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:28,637
Hello.

41
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,372
Thank you.

42
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,827
Hoo-hoo.
Hi, Papa.

43
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:39,531
So. They needed
airplane mechanics.

44
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,567
I raised my hand.
Do you know what they gave me?

45
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:47,422
Four visas to America! Maria,
did you know that your father...

46
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,158
Is the cleverest man
in all Vienna?

47
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,427
Gita, look.

48
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:54,963
Four visas.
One for each of us.

49
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:58,951
And flowers for the most
beautiful woman in the world.

50
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:01,787
<i>I believed you!
- Stop! What's the matter?</i>

51
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:05,639
You liar! Stop it! You're scaring the child.

52
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:07,941
Get away from her.
You get away from her!

53
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:12,095
- You don't deserve her after what you've done!
- I don't understand!

54
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:14,832
Your cleverness! All your
cleverness won't fix this!

55
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,776
We have to keep going.

56
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,482
The boat leaves from France
in two days.

57
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,919
As soon as we get to America
we'll send for Zsuzsi.

58
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:49,159
At least we know she's safe. You go.
I'm not going anywhere without her.

59
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,096
We have to get out of here.

60
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:55,516
Have you gone crazy?
First we get her.

61
00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:01,805
How, Margit?
How?

62
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:06,259
We can't go back. They'll be watching
for us everywhere in Budapest.

63
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:10,964
I'm not afraid. How did this happen?
I trusted you. I believed you.

64
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:14,234
I believed you. You believed me because
you wanted to get out of Hungary.

65
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:18,138
But not without her. Did you think
there would be no danger? No risk?

66
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:21,241
We are running out of money.
There is no work here.

67
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:24,027
We'll never get another chance.

68
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:32,519
You want me to leave my baby?

69
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:36,339
She's my baby too.

70
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,604
It's difficult
to find a good suit.

71
00:23:31,672 --> 00:23:35,208
You know, they don't eat veal
in this country.

72
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,377
<i>Hamburgers.
Hamburgers!</i>

73
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:46,703
- Be careful.
- I don't mean it. Sorry.

74
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,972
I got a lot of girls
that can do this job.

75
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,226
<i>Please, I have family. And I have a business.</i>

76
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:55,028
It was my mistake. I was clumsy.
I bumped into her. I'm sorry.

77
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:58,631
<i>Then be more careful. You're
giving away all my profit.</i>

78
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:02,119
- Understand?
- Yes, Mr. Woods.

79
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,440
<i>Break's over!
Yes, sir.</i>

80
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:11,278
Half an hour for lunch! Finish your lunch.
It's the contracts the company's getting.

81
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:15,048
Come on. Everything
is so fast in this country.

82
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:20,837
Nobody stops for life. Well,
starting over is not easy for anyone.

83
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:24,390
For Margit and I-
losing a child's not...

84
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,762
She's not lost.
Yeah, I know.

85
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,854
I sold two.

86
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:40,507
One to the German,
believe it or not.

87
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:44,494
Soon we'll have enough to move.

88
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:47,497
Hello, my sweetheart.

89
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,101
From Gyuri?

90
00:24:55,506 --> 00:24:58,308
Oh! Look at her.

91
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,977
She looks so much like you.

92
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,185
Look at her little arms.

93
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:14,358
I never saw her first step.

94
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:19,396
Or heard her first word.

95
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:24,801
We are doing everything we can.

96
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:31,574
We must keep faith.

97
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:36,680
All we can do is build a life
here for when she does come.

98
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:43,786
When?

99
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:23,393
Dag hammarskjold, secretary
general of the united nations.

100
00:26:23,461 --> 00:26:25,262
Dear Mr. Hammarskjold.

101
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:29,399
My name is Margit Sandor, and I am
writing to ask you to please hear my story...

102
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:32,302
Mr. John Singer,
the American red cross.

103
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,171
Dear Mr. singer.
This is the third time...

104
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,507
Vice president Richard Nixon.
Dear Vice President.

105
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:40,810
We are a family who recently
escaped from...

106
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,379
Senator Barry Goldwater.

107
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,381
U.S. house of representatives.

108
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:47,817
Dear Senator Goldwater.

109
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:58,194
Hello! Hi!

110
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:02,649
<i>Hello?</i>

111
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:08,838
Welcome to the neighborhood.
I'm Dottie. Hi, I'm Pattie.

112
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:11,908
- Hello.
- What a beautiful chandelier.

113
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:16,495
It is. Oh, I hope you
like upside-down cake.

114
00:27:17,782 --> 00:27:20,650
Oh, yes, of course.
Of course. Come in, please.

115
00:27:20,717 --> 00:27:23,436
Thank you.

116
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:28,891
These small cups are so cute.

117
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:31,961
<i>They're from my country. I hear
you're from behind the iron curtain.</i>

118
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:36,733
Uh, Poland? Hungary. It's a neighbor with Austria.

119
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:40,570
It must be very beautiful. It was.

120
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:53,332
Oh. Wow. Maggie,
you know Eleanor Roosevelt?

121
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,435
Nikita Khrushchev!

122
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:57,603
I'm just writing to them
to ask for help for my family.

123
00:27:57,671 --> 00:28:00,239
Help? Well, what is it,
Maggie?

124
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,241
Maybe we can help you.

125
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:09,766
<i>My youngest child, Zsuzsi, was
left behind in Hungary. Oh, no!</i>

126
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:13,002
She lives with a family
in the country.

127
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,906
My husband says that
the Americans will help us.

128
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:20,977
So I keep writing them. Well, they will. We will.

129
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:23,479
Mrs. Roosevelt
has a very good heart.

130
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:31,671
Oh. She's so precious.
How old is she?

131
00:28:31,738 --> 00:28:33,673
Five and a half years.

132
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,159
<i>Why would they want
a little girl?</i>

133
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,774
Wow.
Mmm.

134
00:31:55,842 --> 00:31:59,979
<i>Oh, nice.</i>

135
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:05,401
Away from the grill.

136
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:40,602
Helen.

137
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,488
Zsuzsi!

138
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:09,010
Mm-hmm.

139
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,322
Happy?

140
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:16,263
Tonight she will be sleeping
right here.

141
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,399
I will be tucking her in
and kissing her good night...

142
00:39:19,466 --> 00:39:22,335
And telling her
how much I love her.

143
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:28,024
I'll come home early from the factory so
we get to the airport in plenty of time. No?

144
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,728
Okay.

145
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,930
Peter.

146
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,782
What if she's not on the plane?

147
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,152
Gita. She'll be here.

148
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,122
What will she be like?

149
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:52,549
She'll love you.

150
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:55,068
Just as much as I do.

151
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:09,616
What's going on?

152
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:11,885
It's so early.
It's early?

153
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,721
It's 6:00 in the morning, you
lazy girl! It's time to get up.

154
00:40:57,548 --> 00:41:02,535
Attention, please. Flight two
from Budapest via London...

155
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,403
Is now arriving.

156
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,106
Welcome.
Zsuzsi.

157
00:42:18,512 --> 00:42:20,680
Welcome home.
Hi.

158
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:28,721
Smile, folks.
Look at the camera.

159
00:43:04,475 --> 00:43:06,893
Look! Here they come!

160
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,962
- Hi!
- Ooh!

161
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:30,249
Now can I go to the park?
No.

162
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,252
What? Mom, that's not fair! Okay, okay, go.

163
00:43:55,877 --> 00:43:58,578
This is ketchup. It's very good. All right?

164
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,489
Um, no, no. You eat this with your hands.

165
00:44:09,556 --> 00:44:13,309
It's a hamburger.

166
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:19,182
A toast to our family.

167
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,618
Together at last.

168
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:32,344
Cheers.
Cheers.

169
00:44:36,082 --> 00:44:38,467
That's Coca-Cola.
Isn't it good?

170
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:41,069
Can you say "Coca-Cola"?
Coca-Cola.

171
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,471
Coca-Cola.
- Listen.

172
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:47,658
That's us. Come!

173
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,462
Welcome home, Suzanne.

174
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,432
The little girl who had been kept
behind the iron curtain for six years...

175
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,070
Was reunited
with a happy family today,

176
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:02,273
thanks to the help
of the American red cross.

177
00:45:06,195 --> 00:45:08,463
<i>After years
of heartbreak and struggle,</i>

178
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:11,265
<i>the Sandor family is together
again. This is television. TV.</i>

179
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,933
TV.

180
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,624
<i>America welcomes you, Suzanne.</i>

181
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:24,863
<i>This is bubble gum.</i>

182
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,898
You wanna make a bubble?

183
00:45:26,966 --> 00:45:30,251
You gotta flatten it out first
with your tongue.

184
00:45:35,157 --> 00:45:38,259
That's okay.
You'll get the hang of it.

185
00:50:08,514 --> 00:50:10,715
I know she wasn't out front. I'll
take the car out looking for her.

186
00:50:10,782 --> 00:50:14,019
I'll call the police. The
police? Gita, stop. No, no, no.

187
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:16,104
Just wait, just wait.
She'll be fine.

188
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:20,408
I'll find her.
Just calm down, okay?

189
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,974
Is anything wrong?

190
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:42,746
What's your name?

191
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:49,853
See house.

192
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,690
I know who you are.

193
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:57,828
You're the little communist girl
from czechoslovakia.

194
00:50:57,896 --> 00:51:00,797
I saw you on the news.
I'll take you home.

195
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,168
You like doggies?
He's my doggie.

196
00:51:05,236 --> 00:51:09,840
This looks just like my house,
but this one's yours.

197
00:51:09,907 --> 00:51:13,176
I bet your mom's been looking
for you.

198
00:51:13,245 --> 00:51:15,679
Oh. Here you go.

199
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:25,856
Please don't do that again.

200
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,991
Jeno.

201
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:03,087
Betty, this is my kid sister.

202
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:06,256
<i>Hi.
Hi.</i>

203
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:12,713
- Who said you could
play with my stuff?

204
00:53:12,781 --> 00:53:16,183
"Sorry," "sorry"! Mom said
you have to speak in English.

205
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:21,855
- Sorry.
- Good.

206
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:25,025
You have to learn to talk in English or
everybody's gonna think you're a creep.

207
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:29,713
<i>Creep?
Yes, creep. Jerk.</i>

208
00:53:29,781 --> 00:53:31,815
You have to learn
these hip words.

209
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:39,156
Like when you say something
tastes really good,

210
00:53:39,224 --> 00:53:42,426
you say it tastes like shit.

211
00:53:42,494 --> 00:53:44,110
Shit.

212
00:53:44,178 --> 00:53:47,747
<i>- Yes, that's perfect!
- Yes, that was really good.</i>

213
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:28,489
Zsuzsi. Zsuzsi.

214
00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:32,659
This would look
so pretty on you.

215
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,661
May I help you, madam?

216
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,163
Yes, I want to buy some dresses
for my daughter.

217
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,717
I like cowboy pants.

218
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:44,104
Blue jeans.
Blue jeans.

219
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:49,209
I don't know why little girls in
America want to look like boys. Come.

220
00:54:52,046 --> 00:54:54,180
You're beautiful.

221
00:54:55,717 --> 00:54:59,185
I never go to store.

222
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:03,590
My mama...
Make my dress.

223
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:07,127
Zsuzsi,

224
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,396
I'm your mother.

225
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:12,533
I want you to call me mama.

226
00:55:14,836 --> 00:55:18,772
Teri and Jeno took care of you,
and they love you,

227
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,941
but I'm your mama.

228
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:26,563
Come here.

229
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:37,558
Hey! How are you,
my friend?

230
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,393
Say "cheese."
Cheese.

231
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:42,580
Not a bad life for a factory
worker, yeah? Not bad.

232
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:47,451
Only in America. We had these things in
Hungary before you Russians showed up.

233
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:49,653
Dottie, this is
my friend Frank.

234
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,339
Oh. I've never met
a Russian before.

235
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:12,258
Zsuzsi.

236
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:16,747
You look so beautiful.

237
00:56:16,814 --> 00:56:19,049
I'm so proud of you, honey.

238
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:26,373
They're nice.
So many of them.

239
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,611
Hi, Suzanne.
Oh, Sheila?

240
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,846
<i>Did you come say "hi"
to Suzanne?</i>

241
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:36,483
Say "hi" to Suzanne.
Hi.

242
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,552
Hi.

243
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,588
How are you, Suzanne? I am fine.

244
00:56:41,656 --> 00:56:45,708
You speak English so well! Thank you.

245
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:48,845
Have you tasted
all this wonderful food?

246
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:51,196
Yes. It is shit.

247
00:56:55,936 --> 00:56:57,953
<i>I'd like to make a toast...</i>

248
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:01,340
First of all to you, our friends,
who have come here to share...

249
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:04,994
In the homecoming of our
youngest daughter, Zsuzsi.

250
00:57:05,061 --> 00:57:07,663
We waited for her
for a very long time.

251
00:57:07,731 --> 00:57:10,966
And to the greatest country
in the world. To America!

252
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:46,335
Zsuzsi!

253
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,974
Great party, huh?

254
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:12,444
Mom won't let me go to Betty's pajama party
just because I taught you some English.

255
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,752
I don't know why you keep all
your stuff in that old suitcase.

256
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:23,389
You're not going anywhere.
I go home.

257
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:29,628
Sorry, but you're in
the good old U.S.A... To stay.

258
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:33,316
No! Grandma said
I go back for school!

259
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:48,280
Zsuzsi!

260
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:14,106
You know, you frightened
your mother and me.

261
00:59:27,337 --> 00:59:30,439
On the day you were born,

262
00:59:30,507 --> 00:59:36,245
your grandmother Helen, she came
to the hospital and she said to me,

263
00:59:36,313 --> 00:59:40,249
"Peter, you mustn't worry
that you didn't have a son...

264
00:59:40,317 --> 00:59:43,702
"Because when this child
grows up,

265
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:47,807
she's going to be able to do all
the things that a man can do."

266
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:52,578
She was right, Zsuzsi.

267
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:59,418
You can do with your life
anything that you want.

268
01:00:01,455 --> 01:00:03,589
But not in Hungary.

269
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:09,428
I like Hungary.
So do I.

270
01:00:11,264 --> 01:00:16,101
But... there are some terrible
things that happened there.

271
01:00:16,169 --> 01:00:19,839
They happened to your mother,
and they happened to me...

272
01:00:19,906 --> 01:00:23,042
And to people that we loved.

273
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:26,779
We didn't want them ever to
happen to you, to your sister.

274
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:32,617
That's why we came to America.

275
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:35,971
Why did you leave me?

276
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,725
It was a mistake.

277
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:45,414
We never wanted to leave you.
You were our little girl.

278
01:00:48,084 --> 01:00:50,552
I want to go home.

279
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,605
I know you do.

280
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:58,844
And I know you love
Teri and Jeno.

281
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:02,113
But do you think you could try
to learn to love us too?

282
01:01:08,855 --> 01:01:11,357
I'll make you a deal.

283
01:01:14,327 --> 01:01:16,995
When you're older,

284
01:01:17,063 --> 01:01:21,834
if you still want to go,
I'll buy you a ticket.

285
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:24,470
Okay? But for now,

286
01:01:24,537 --> 01:01:27,773
try to like it here.

287
01:01:27,841 --> 01:01:30,893
Will you do that for me?

288
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:33,029
And for your mother.

289
01:01:36,967 --> 01:01:39,218
Is it a deal?

290
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:45,624
Okay.

291
01:02:12,335 --> 01:02:15,371
? Don't let the sun?

292
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:18,440
? Catch you crying?

293
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:24,279
<i>? Tonight's the time?</i>

294
01:02:24,347 --> 01:02:27,082
<i>? For your tears? "I miss you more than ever.</i>

295
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,918
<i>"Summer's finally here,
and the flowers...</i>

296
01:02:29,986 --> 01:02:32,154
<i>Remind me of home."</i>

297
01:02:35,691 --> 01:02:38,477
Good night.
Okay.

298
01:02:38,545 --> 01:02:40,746
I love you so much.

299
01:02:51,591 --> 01:02:54,259
Suzanne!

300
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:56,195
Hey!

301
01:02:56,262 --> 01:02:58,396
Hey.

302
01:03:09,242 --> 01:03:12,126
You're gonna have seven children. Seven?

303
01:03:12,194 --> 01:03:14,328
<i>Mmm. Let me see.</i>

304
01:03:14,396 --> 01:03:18,499
<i>Your wife's name
starts with an "s."</i>

305
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:23,905
Does your mother always give
you a hard time about going out?

306
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:28,375
No, it's not her fault,
you know?

307
01:03:28,443 --> 01:03:32,780
I mean, she just wants me to grow
up as if I were in Hungary and...

308
01:03:32,848 --> 01:03:34,782
She just doesn't get it,
you know?

309
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,918
Were you born in Hungary?

310
01:03:36,986 --> 01:03:40,154
You bet.
That's cool.

311
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:42,490
Is that cool?
Yeah.

312
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:45,459
"Yeah."
Shut up.

313
01:03:52,234 --> 01:03:54,368
Everybody else is going.

314
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:57,138
We're not like everybody else.

315
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:01,576
That's the problem.

316
01:04:15,441 --> 01:04:18,776
You okay?

317
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,513
Whoo!

318
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:24,949
Hmm?

319
01:04:43,418 --> 01:04:45,669
<i>Zsuzsanna!</i>

320
01:05:06,724 --> 01:05:09,894
Where did you and Sheila go
all afternoon with those boys?

321
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:12,663
We went for a drive.

322
01:05:17,035 --> 01:05:19,170
You've been drinking.

323
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:22,690
Did you let him touch you or...

324
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:26,627
I can't believe you embarrassed me
in front of my friends like that!

325
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:28,796
That boy's
much too old for you!

326
01:05:28,864 --> 01:05:31,916
I don't want you to ruin your life!
How do you know what will ruin my life?

327
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:34,001
Do you know what your father
and I had to go through...

328
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:36,237
Yeah, I know!
You walked 20 kilometers...

329
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:39,156
<i>And you climbed
under barbed wire, right?</i>

330
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:43,677
- Yeah, I know.
- You don't know anything.

331
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:48,382
Hello.

332
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:50,650
Please don't leave
before we talk to her.

333
01:05:50,718 --> 01:05:53,453
I'll call home tonight.
I'll talk to her then.

334
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:57,758
This is not something we can talk about
on the phone. She's going to be fine.

335
01:05:57,825 --> 01:06:00,178
She's growing up.
It's natural.

336
01:06:00,245 --> 01:06:03,147
If you want the truth, she's exactly
like you were. That's ridiculous!

337
01:06:03,215 --> 01:06:05,816
She's not like me. You know
how children grow up here?

338
01:06:05,884 --> 01:06:09,920
Drinking, driving fast and worse. How
would you know? You're always busy.

339
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:13,257
Okay. I'll call you
from Dallas.

340
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:18,930
Good-bye.

341
01:06:23,151 --> 01:06:25,636
Hey.
Hey.

342
01:06:25,703 --> 01:06:29,907
Your mom says you can't come
out. She says I have to stay in.

343
01:06:29,975 --> 01:06:31,775
No!
Yeah.

344
01:06:33,778 --> 01:06:35,979
What are you gonna do
about Paul?

345
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:40,033
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

346
01:06:40,101 --> 01:06:43,120
Okay.

347
01:07:04,976 --> 01:07:07,195
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

348
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:14,919
She's just upset because she
thinks you're gonna run away again.

349
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:18,088
No, I know, but I didn't
run away. I just went out.

350
01:07:21,426 --> 01:07:24,628
When's dad coming home?

351
01:07:24,696 --> 01:07:30,133
Ahh, not till the end of the week. Hmm.

352
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:33,737
But you know mom.
Just apologize, be nice...

353
01:07:33,805 --> 01:07:36,306
And she'll calm down.

354
01:07:36,374 --> 01:07:39,042
Yeah, but it's always
been easier for you.

355
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:43,763
No. No, it wasn't.

356
01:07:43,831 --> 01:07:46,266
It's always been about you.

357
01:07:47,919 --> 01:07:52,222
And no matter what I did,
it was never enough.

358
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:57,828
That's why I can't wait to get
married and get out of here.

359
01:08:16,064 --> 01:08:18,465
Darling, I don't want to fight.

360
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:23,353
<i>So I want you
to make me a promise.</i>

361
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:25,689
You want me
to make you a promise?

362
01:08:25,757 --> 01:08:28,175
Yes.

363
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,954
Good night.

364
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,968
Where were you all night?

365
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:13,606
Hmm?

366
01:11:17,377 --> 01:11:21,313
You were with that boy again,
weren't you? Yeah. His name is Paul.

367
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:31,507
Zsuzsi, girls don't stay
out all night... your age.

368
01:11:31,575 --> 01:11:33,676
You understand that?

369
01:11:33,743 --> 01:11:36,679
You understand that?
Why would I listen to you?

370
01:11:36,746 --> 01:11:38,931
I don't want you to do this again! Ever!

371
01:11:38,999 --> 01:11:43,002
You never let me do anything anyway! I hate you!

372
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:51,704
I won't let you ruin your life.

373
01:15:24,891 --> 01:15:27,042
Get dressed and
clean up your room, please.

374
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,097
<i>- When dad calls,
can I talk to him?</i>

375
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:36,251
Oh, no.
Wha...

376
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,121
If you come back, I'll call
the police! What are you doing?

377
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:41,557
I'm doing what's best for you.
Listen to me.

378
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,727
How do you know what's best
for me? I'm your mother!

379
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:48,764
According to you! I didn't see you
for the first six years of my life!

380
01:15:48,832 --> 01:15:51,667
What kind of mother is that? One that loves you!

381
01:15:51,735 --> 01:15:54,486
What kind of mother-
get off of me!

382
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:59,508
Mom!

383
01:15:59,576 --> 01:16:01,510
Mom, open the door!

384
01:16:01,578 --> 01:16:04,980
Open this door!

385
01:16:05,048 --> 01:16:06,866
Mom, please open the door!

386
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:12,622
<i>Mom!</i>

387
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:17,359
Mom!

388
01:17:08,927 --> 01:17:11,646
Mom, open the door!

389
01:17:18,137 --> 01:17:19,821
<i>No, no, no!</i>

390
01:19:27,683 --> 01:19:30,151
Here's your coffee.
Thank you.

391
01:19:52,608 --> 01:19:55,343
I wanted to say I was sorry.

392
01:19:56,345 --> 01:20:00,481
This episode-
it could've ruined your life.

393
01:20:00,549 --> 01:20:04,753
<i>You might have killed someone. I'm sorry.</i>

394
01:20:07,105 --> 01:20:10,641
Have some breakfast.
We'll talk.

395
01:20:16,232 --> 01:20:18,433
I think I know
what I have to do.

396
01:20:20,436 --> 01:20:24,339
I've been thinking about it since
that night in the park and...

397
01:20:27,376 --> 01:20:30,178
I think I have to go
to Budapest.

398
01:20:30,246 --> 01:20:33,915
- To Budapest?
- That's ridiculous.

399
01:20:33,982 --> 01:20:37,585
Mom, I can't explain why I
have to go, I just have to go.

400
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:44,759
Completely out of the question.
When you finish high school...

401
01:20:44,827 --> 01:20:49,530
And you show us that you know how to
behave, then you can go. I have to go now!

402
01:20:49,598 --> 01:20:52,233
This is just another of your
crazy ideas! You're just a child!

403
01:20:52,301 --> 01:20:55,954
I am not a child!
Why do you always say that?

404
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:00,091
You don't even know who I am.

405
01:21:03,862 --> 01:21:08,199
What are you thinking? You
can't go to Europe by yourself.

406
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:11,285
I came from Budapest
when I was a little kid.

407
01:21:11,353 --> 01:21:13,939
Do you think what you went
through last night was terrible?

408
01:21:14,006 --> 01:21:17,542
Do you know that in Hungary people
disappear for saying the wrong word?

409
01:21:17,609 --> 01:21:19,911
<i>And you shoot up your room!</i>

410
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:29,203
I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not
going to discuss it. It's ridiculous!

411
01:21:48,808 --> 01:21:53,912
Dad, do you remember when I
came to America and I ran away?

412
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:57,215
And you made that promise.

413
01:21:58,717 --> 01:22:01,019
In the park.

414
01:22:01,086 --> 01:22:03,238
We shook hands.

415
01:22:09,778 --> 01:22:12,881
I need you to keep
your promise, dad.

416
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:17,018
Please.

417
01:23:12,806 --> 01:23:14,874
Zsuzsi?

418
01:23:16,177 --> 01:23:18,328
Zsuzsi.

419
01:23:45,255 --> 01:23:48,524
What bridge is that?
It's the chain bridge.

420
01:23:48,592 --> 01:23:53,029
Don't you remember? When you
left home with your grandmother,

421
01:23:53,096 --> 01:23:56,999
I tell you about it.
I remember.

422
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:03,923
Mmm.

423
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:13,716
<i>We say "budapesht,"
not "Budapest."</i>

424
01:24:13,784 --> 01:24:15,718
Budapest.
"Budapesht."

425
01:24:15,786 --> 01:24:18,821
"Budapesht."
"Sht. Sht."

426
01:24:18,889 --> 01:24:23,042
How long have you lived here? Five years.

427
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,044
Really?
Mm-hmm.

428
01:24:25,112 --> 01:24:27,647
It's nice.
Ahh.

429
01:24:30,651 --> 01:24:34,838
I am back with
a very grown-up young lady.

430
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:37,757
Zsuzsi.
Mama.

431
01:24:37,824 --> 01:24:40,459
Mama.

432
01:24:40,527 --> 01:24:42,595
Zsuzsi.

433
01:24:44,999 --> 01:24:48,001
Zsuzsi, my little girl.

434
01:24:48,069 --> 01:24:50,136
My daughter.

435
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,912
Please eat.

436
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,885
This was always your favorite.

437
01:27:53,888 --> 01:27:57,390
I used to hide my favorite chicks when
I was little so they wouldn't get cooked.

438
01:27:57,457 --> 01:27:59,392
I know.

439
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:03,829
Do you miss the country?

440
01:28:05,465 --> 01:28:10,270
Now that little house you
grew up in is a summer place...

441
01:28:10,337 --> 01:28:12,622
For a government big shot.

442
01:28:12,689 --> 01:28:16,559
Can they do that, just take your house away? Hmph!

443
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,794
They can, and they did.

444
01:28:18,862 --> 01:28:21,831
But after you were gone,

445
01:28:21,898 --> 01:28:25,702
it was better for us
to move away.

446
01:28:25,769 --> 01:28:29,371
But now you've come home.

447
01:28:31,207 --> 01:28:33,509
At last.

448
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:44,346
Good morning.

449
01:29:45,982 --> 01:29:48,216
I have to go.
Where are you going?

450
01:29:48,284 --> 01:29:51,586
I'm going to see my grandmother.

451
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:54,289
I have to.

452
01:29:54,357 --> 01:29:56,591
I have to. I'm sorry.

453
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:15,977
This is my friend Paul.

454
01:30:18,214 --> 01:30:20,882
Mmm. He is very handsome.

455
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:35,729
I used to walk here
with your mother...

456
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:38,766
When she was a little girl.

457
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,202
The gypsies played
their violins...

458
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:43,637
While their children
begged for money.

459
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:46,640
Your mother gave them
all my coins.

460
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:51,645
What's wrong?

461
01:30:51,713 --> 01:30:55,967
An old lady can see things
in people's faces.

462
01:30:56,035 --> 01:30:58,136
Mom didn't want me to come,

463
01:30:58,204 --> 01:31:00,905
especially to see
Teri and Jeno.

464
01:31:00,973 --> 01:31:03,608
Now that I'm here,
it's so hard.

465
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:05,843
They've been so good to me,

466
01:31:05,911 --> 01:31:08,546
and they've been so hurt.

467
01:31:08,614 --> 01:31:11,216
I guess I just make
everybody unhappy.

468
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:18,389
Budapest is such
a beautiful place.

469
01:31:20,258 --> 01:31:22,960
Why did mom hate it so much?

470
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:26,247
Mmm.

471
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:29,383
It was wise of you to come.

472
01:31:37,276 --> 01:31:40,111
Your mother was our only child.

473
01:31:40,178 --> 01:31:44,332
Your grandfather loved her so.

474
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:46,868
He was so proud of her.

475
01:31:46,936 --> 01:31:49,537
One night during the war,

476
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:52,874
we were sitting
in this very cafe.

477
01:31:58,196 --> 01:32:00,899
<i>There were some
Russian soldiers.</i>

478
01:32:00,966 --> 01:32:02,967
<i>They were very drunk.</i>

479
01:32:27,059 --> 01:32:31,629
They shot him
right in front of us.

480
01:32:31,697 --> 01:32:34,499
Grandfather fell
right on top of your mother,

481
01:32:34,566 --> 01:32:38,570
his blood pouring onto her.

482
01:32:59,575 --> 01:33:02,577
My husband was dead.

483
01:33:02,644 --> 01:33:06,714
And your mother made it her
goal to get out of Hungary...

484
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:09,550
And go to America.

485
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:13,153
She wanted her children
to live in a better world.

486
01:34:29,014 --> 01:34:31,966
Do you enjoy your stay
in Budapest?

487
01:34:37,606 --> 01:34:39,891
I'm happy to be here with you.

488
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:42,359
Your visit has been
a great gift to us.

489
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,979
It was good of your parents
to let you come here.

490
01:34:51,453 --> 01:34:53,554
I have to go.

491
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,409
I have to go home.

492
01:35:01,379 --> 01:35:05,733
It's funny, but all these years I
felt like I didn't belong anywhere.

493
01:35:06,985 --> 01:35:10,054
I thought maybe I belonged
in Hungary, but...

494
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:13,941
And I love being here.

495
01:35:14,093 --> 01:35:16,894
I love you.

496
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,182
But this is no longer my home.

497
01:35:41,687 --> 01:35:44,155
How many people live here now?

498
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:46,991
Mmm, ten or twelve.

499
01:35:47,059 --> 01:35:50,627
A different family lives
in each of our rooms.

500
01:35:50,695 --> 01:35:55,166
They share the bathroom and the kitchen. Hmm.

501
01:36:07,478 --> 01:36:09,579
Was it very awful?

502
01:36:09,647 --> 01:36:12,482
Prison?
Mm-hmm.

503
01:36:13,851 --> 01:36:18,087
First I thought
I wouldn't survive.

504
01:36:18,154 --> 01:36:22,792
But one day I began to play
a game in my head.

505
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,394
I began make up stories
for you and Maria...

506
01:36:25,462 --> 01:36:31,317
<i>Stories about princesses,
castles, magic.</i>

507
01:36:31,384 --> 01:36:37,173
I hoped that I would
one day tell you.

508
01:36:42,896 --> 01:36:45,698
You risked everything for me.

509
01:36:51,037 --> 01:36:52,972
What do I do?

510
01:36:55,358 --> 01:36:57,827
I think you know.

511
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,756
We all made mistakes
out of love.

512
01:37:10,824 --> 01:37:14,977
Okay?

513
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:20,016
I could send for you.

514
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:23,819
Dad would help me. He would. And mom would too.

515
01:37:23,887 --> 01:37:25,821
My other mom.

516
01:37:25,889 --> 01:37:28,724
Our traveling days are over.

517
01:37:28,792 --> 01:37:33,996
But you are young and you must
enjoy every moment of life.

518
01:37:36,299 --> 01:37:39,368
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay? We will be fine.

519
01:37:39,436 --> 01:37:41,620
You made me very happy.

520
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:58,637
Zsuzsi, please don't forget us.

521
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,175
I won't.

522
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:12,505
It was an amazing trip.

523
01:40:12,572 --> 01:40:16,108
I'm glad.
I'm glad you went.

524
01:40:16,176 --> 01:40:18,110
You are?

525
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:20,145
I'm proud of you.

526
01:40:20,213 --> 01:40:22,415
You're a brave girl.

527
01:40:22,482 --> 01:40:25,451
You're brave.

528
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:29,322
Why didn't you tell me?

529
01:40:29,389 --> 01:40:31,890
I just wanted to leave it
all behind me.

530
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:35,277
I was frightened.

531
01:40:35,345 --> 01:40:37,546
I wanted to protect you.

532
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,719
I understand.

533
01:40:43,787 --> 01:40:48,490
You know, since you left,
I understood something too.

534
01:40:48,558 --> 01:40:52,762
That we are who we are
because of our past.

535
01:40:52,829 --> 01:40:56,531
You know, you taught me that.

536
01:40:59,936 --> 01:41:01,871
Hi, mom.

537
01:41:03,273 --> 01:41:06,142
Hi, my daughter.

538
01:41:06,209 --> 01:41:09,544
You're so beautiful.

539
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,903
My darling.

540
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:32,618
Hey.

541
01:41:36,255 --> 01:41:38,190
Hey.
