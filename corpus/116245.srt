1
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:12,005
Hello.

2
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,617
Good, good. You counted it?
Okay.

3
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:19,878
Yeah, l just spoke to him. He's cool.

4
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,324
Where's Peter?

5
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,195
You killed him, didn't you?

6
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:37,195
You killed him.
And you're gonna kill me.

7
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:40,966
Well, you are making it
awfully tempting.

8
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,137
Listen, Mary, l want you to know...

9
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:50,610
...that l really enjoyed
the last 2 4 hours.

10
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,720
And that includes our little party.

11
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,659
Marvin, are you in place?

12
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,801
All right.

13
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,335
Just wait a minute,
and then do it.

14
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:11,664
You said do it!

15
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:18,711
You don't want to blow it now, do you?
We've come so far together.

16
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,576
Remember what we talked about?

17
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:26,820
l remember. l won't tell. l promise
l won't tell. l won't tell anyone.

18
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,580
Guess what?

19
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:33,089
He's in the playground
right behind me.

20
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,491
Where? Where?

21
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,153
Goodbye, Mary.

22
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,514
Peter.

23
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,357
Peter.

24
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:15,493
Peter! Peter! Come here.

25
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,238
Twenty-three hours and 20 minutes,
Joey.

26
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,048
Yeah, you did good, Marvin.

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,457
Do we have to do this again?

28
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:50,163
l wonder if l'm gonna miss
bringing families together.

29
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,177
You got it?

30
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,717
Come here. Don't go.

31
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,146
This is for both of us, okay?
And for Abby.

32
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:20,852
She's growing up so fast. l don't
want you to miss anything important.

33
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:25,260
l know. l know. lt's almost over.
Last time.

34
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:29,028
-When are you gonna take me for a ride?
-Well...

35
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,400
...l booked a cabin up at Whistler
this weekend.

36
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:34,541
Yes!

37
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,377
-You did?
-l did.

38
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,136
Okay.

39
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,378
-Abby, are you all right?
-Yeah, l was just looking at crabs.

40
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,854
Daddy, don't worry so much.

41
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:56,086
Yeah, Daddy, don't worry so much.
We'll be fine.

42
00:06:01,168 --> 00:06:04,069
-You look after Mommy, okay?
-Okay.

43
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:12,736
-Will you wiggle your wings after takeoff?
-Better watch and see.

44
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:18,751
Wiggle your wings? lt's waggle your wings,
not wiggle your wings.

45
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,006
He did it.
He wiggled his wings.

46
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,029
-l wanna do it.
-Yeah?

47
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:08,998
Okay. Take all the trash mail
out for me.

48
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:14,665
-All that mail that we keep getting.
-Always trash.

49
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,744
-All junk.
-All junk?

50
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:25,978
-All junk.
-Put it up there.

51
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:29,645
-Want some ice cream?
-Yeah.

52
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,987
-l need to tink first.
-Okay.

53
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:38,764
Hey, Abby, bring me the clothes
in the hamper while you're in there.

54
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:57,074
Karen, are you in? It's Joan.

55
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:05,785
Okay, I guess you're not there.
Listen, I got a free night tonight.

56
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:09,657
Billy's on a sleepover.
Call me, now.

57
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:35,714
Abby, l'm ready for the clothes.

58
00:08:42,596 --> 00:08:44,826
l got her.

59
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,595
What are you doing?

60
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:50,862
They're less nervous
with something from home.

61
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:55,634
-First call 30 from now.
-Same as always. Go. Go. Go.

62
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:04,941
You okay? You need help?

63
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:16,293
-Probed, not insulted.
-We could remove the crayon for you.

64
00:09:16,464 --> 00:09:20,730
It could increase your brainpower,
or it could kill you.

65
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,601
Increase my killing power, eh?

66
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:28,105
Abby, what happened to you
helping me with the laundry?

67
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,003
-Homey, where have you been?
-I just underwent--

68
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,148
-Why so loud?
-To increase my IQ 50 points.

69
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,944
-Really?
-Abby!

70
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,950
--spiffy nerd ensemble.

71
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:47,322
Mrs. Jennings, stay calm. Abby's not here,
but she's absolutely fine.

72
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:51,397
My name is Joe. l'm gonna help you
through this thing.

73
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,341
Abby, where are you?!

74
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,957
Good evening.

75
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:53,558
-Dr. Jennings.
-Yes, doctor.

76
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:58,096
Several guests mentioned they're
looking forward to your speech.

77
00:10:58,265 --> 00:10:59,391
Nice to hear.

78
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:07,701
Where's my baby?

79
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,776
-You don't wanna shoot me.
-Where is she?

80
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:15,471
Abby is with my cousin.
My cousin has a cell phone.

81
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:18,915
lf l don't call every 30 minutes,
he'll kill her.

82
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:24,023
-Can l just say you look prettier in person?
-Sit down!

83
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,783
Look, Mrs. Jennings.

84
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:31,894
Nothing is gonna happen to Abby
as long as nothing happens to me. Okay?

85
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,863
You can count on Marvin.
He always does exactly what he's told...

86
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:40,234
...as long as it's me doing the telling.

87
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,932
What do you want?

88
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:50,216
You're a smart lady. You pick up
things really quickly. You do.

89
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:53,012
This is a kidnapping for ransom.

90
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:57,249
But it's not just any kidnapping.
lt's a perfect kidnapping.

91
00:11:57,424 --> 00:12:03,056
l know that. l've done it four times
before, and l haven't been caught yet.

92
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,530
-Take me to her, son of a bitch.
-l know what you're thinking.

93
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:12,537
What happened to the other kids, right?
Every single one of those kids...

94
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:18,043
...is now watching Barney, swimming
in their pools, riding their ponies...

95
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:23,138
...or whatever rich kids do.
Because l gave their parents the power...

96
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,308
...to keep them alive.

97
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:29,949
And they did. They followed the rules.

98
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:34,254
They let me make my calls to Marvin
to keep him safe.

99
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,928
-Now, Karen....
-My God.

100
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,660
l hope it's okay that l call you Karen.

101
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:51,101
You can keep that gun if you want...

102
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:57,850
...if it makes you feel better. But l
wanna tell you something about that gun.

103
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:01,613
lt kills two people with one bullet.

104
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:04,315
Me...

105
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,449
...and Abby.

106
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:19,230
May l?

107
00:13:38,158 --> 00:13:40,820
Okay. Thanks.

108
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:48,032
This is quite a place you got here.

109
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:54,939
Thank you.

110
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:59,374
We are privileged to have with us
a young physician l first met...

111
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,541
...when he was a student doing research
on the sedative properties of Guinness...

112
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,783
...if l remember correctly.

113
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:14,895
Since then, l've watched him rise from
intern to resident to research scientist...

114
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:21,262
...and finally, and best of all
l think you'd agree, patent holder.

115
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:26,964
Ladies and gentlemen, our wunderkind,
Dr. William Jennings.

116
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:37,115
Why won't you let me
give you the money now?

117
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:39,946
For one thing, the banks are closed.

118
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,886
For another thing,
it would look a little suspicious.

119
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:49,120
You see, unlike me,
most kidnappers are morons.

120
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:53,756
They all get busted the minute
they go for the ransom money.

121
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,426
They try all kinds of complicated shit...

122
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:02,735
...but the fact is that no ransom pickup
is safe from the FBl.

123
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,338
You should see the statistics. Near zero
kidnappings are successful. Know why?

124
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:15,421
lt's because of the ransom pickup.
That's why l ain't picking up any ransom.

125
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,822
Was that beautiful, or what?

126
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:25,624
-Why can't Abby be here right now?
-Because this is a machine, okay?

127
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:30,236
This is a machine that runs on fear.

128
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,601
Your fear for Abby.

129
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:41,509
That's the only thing that kept you
from pulling that trigger. Am l right?

130
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:47,014
Physicians have been unable
to use paralyzing relaxants...

131
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:53,251
...without fear of fatal outcomes
or costly lawsuits. That day is over.

132
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:56,058
l am now injecting Restorase...

133
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:58,992
...developed by myself
and Brown Adams...

134
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:04,763
...and tested in my own clinical trials
at Astoria Memorial Hospital in Portland.

135
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:13,874
This variant of atropine counteracts
the effects of succinylcholine...

136
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:17,642
...restoring full nerve conductivity
and muscle function.

137
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:22,215
Don't you have any feeling
for the children you hurt?

138
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,517
A kid can stand anything for 2 4 hours.

139
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:28,855
l stood a lot worse for years.

140
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:34,426
What are you talking about, 2 4 hours?

141
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:37,399
This whole show takes exactly 2 4 hours.

142
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:41,029
A day's work for a day's pay,
250K.

143
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,905
Oh, my God. Listen to me.

144
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:49,071
lf you wait till tomorrow,
Abby could die.

145
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,080
You listen to me, okay?

146
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:54,550
We're on a timetable.
Get something straight:

147
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:59,852
There are no deviations,
no exceptions and no surprises.

148
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:06,330
She's asthmatic, severely asthmatic.
She could have an attack at any time.

149
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:07,831
Nice try.

150
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:13,095
Open the drawer you're sitting on.

151
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,437
Open it!

152
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:33,453
-Shit.
-Anything could bring an attack on.

153
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,424
Allergens, smoke, stress.

154
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,657
-Tell me your cousin doesn't smoke.
-l tried to cover everything.

155
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:42,426
-Every goddamn thing.
-Does he smoke?

156
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,628
Shut up.

157
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:49,969
Where are you?

158
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:54,307
Hey. We're almost there. You're early.
What's the matter?

159
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:56,778
Listen. Take a look at the kid.

160
00:17:56,984 --> 00:17:59,646
Give me the phone. Give me the phone!

161
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:05,687
-We got a situation here, Marvin.
-Do you want me to take care of her?

162
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,592
-Not yet.
-lt's been over 30 seconds.

163
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:15,792
-Better hang up.
-This is what l want you to do.

164
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:20,133
Look at the kid, put your hand
on her chest. ls she breathing?

165
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,771
Hold on.

166
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:32,545
-It's kind of, like, shallow.
-This is what l want you to do.

167
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:39,124
Get her inside and close the windows.
Don't let her run around. Okay?

168
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:45,922
lf she has trouble breathing, give her
coffee. The caffeine opens her airways.

169
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:52,193
-Joe? Do you want me to do that?
-Yeah.

170
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,535
Just call me if there's a problem,
okay?

171
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:48,593
You would be grateful...

172
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:51,890
...if l helped your little girl, right?

173
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,799
-Yes.
-What?

174
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,634
Yes.

175
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,639
How would you show me?

176
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:19,287
You take me to her first...

177
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:23,591
...and then l'll show you.

178
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:28,133
How does every woman know that?
How to be a hooker?

179
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:31,236
''Get the payment up front.''

180
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:35,067
ls that what they teach in Home Ec
when we're in Shop?

181
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:40,839
Nobody has to teach you how to protect
a child. You'd know that if you had one.

182
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:44,810
Hey, Marvin. lt's me.

183
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:50,683
-We're almost there. She's still asleep.
-Yeah, okay. Well, l'll call you.

184
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,856
They're not there yet.

185
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,190
l'd like to see the bedroom.

186
00:21:01,101 --> 00:21:02,693
Come on.

187
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,500
Come on.

188
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:30,019
-Hey, Dr. Jennings. Hi.
-Can l help you?

189
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,032
My keycard doesn't work. l wondered if
l could use your phone to call the desk.

190
00:21:36,203 --> 00:21:40,162
-There's house phones by the elevator.
-Yeah, right.

191
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:47,009
-That must be such a rush, huh?
-What?

192
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,049
Just standing up there
and having everybody want to be you:

193
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:57,054
A young guy with a big idea
and a big future.

194
00:21:57,224 --> 00:21:59,749
l got hot just watching you.

195
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:02,360
l'm flattered.

196
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:08,526
l'm also married.

197
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,502
Then we can do things that don't count.

198
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:18,210
Because it's something
l'm doing, not you.

199
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:23,008
l'm sorry, darling,
but l don't think it's gonna happen.

200
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:28,416
You'll find someone.
Hey, you'll find 50. Just....

201
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:30,749
Just not me.

202
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,190
Good night.

203
00:22:36,963 --> 00:22:41,024
Fifty's no good to me
because Abby doesn't have 50 daddies.

204
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:45,029
-What did you say?
-Your daughter was kidnapped.

205
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:49,608
lf you want her to live,
you'll let me in that room right now.

206
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,670
l'm calling the police.

207
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:58,415
Don't! lf you call the cops,
the house...

208
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:02,179
...you may as well put a bullet
into Abby's brain.

209
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:08,951
l have to make a call in five minutes.
lf anything stops me, your kid is dead.

210
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:13,495
-What do l do to get my little girl back?
-You're in a new world.

211
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,930
-My partner has your wife...
-My wife?

212
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:18,468
-...and your girl's being held.
-Where?

213
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:23,836
When you calm down, l'll make a call.
Then this phone will ring every 30 minutes.

214
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,605
lf things aren't cool,
you can pick out a casket.

215
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,750
-Where's my little girl?
-l don't know.

216
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:37,220
She's someplace the police can't possibly
get to in the time between our calls.

217
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:40,349
-That's not good enough.
-Sit down.

218
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:11,391
What about getting Abby back?

219
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:13,518
What about getting Abby back?

220
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:18,130
Tomorrow morning your wife will wire
$250,000 to a local bank.

221
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:20,163
You'll pick up that money.

222
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:24,895
After you give it to me,
your wife and child will be let go.

223
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:27,130
How's she gonna explain that?

224
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:31,641
She's gonna say that you stumbled
onto another painting...

225
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:36,839
...that you simply have to add
to your crappy little art collection.

226
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:42,353
We've got this whole thing covered,
all right? lt's really fucking easy.

227
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:46,788
You follow the rules, you get Abby back.
lt's that simple.

228
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:51,158
You think l believe that
after l've seen your face?

229
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:55,597
This is the fifth time.
All the other parents saw our faces.

230
00:24:55,802 --> 00:24:58,896
Not one of them went to the police.
Know why?

231
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:03,168
lf you go to the police,
they'll look for us and we'll know.

232
00:25:03,343 --> 00:25:07,746
And my partner will come back,
and he will kill your child.

233
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,737
-Hi.
-Marvin, is everything all right?

234
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,338
Marvin!

235
00:25:36,476 --> 00:25:40,435
-Fine. She's been sleeping.
-I'll call you in a half.

236
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:48,953
Mommy?

237
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,922
Your mommy's not here right now. l'm
Marvin. She asked me to keep you a while.

238
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,793
-Where is she?
-No, l mean, just for tonight.

239
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:01,990
Where is she?

240
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:06,161
-She had to go to a party, okay?
-l want my mom.

241
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:10,069
Look, it's okay. Hey, hey, hey. No, it's--

242
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:14,178
lt's okay.
We're gonna be fine here tonight.

243
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,007
lt's gonna go by real fast.

244
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,378
-l want my mom.
-Wait. Can you say ''Marvin''?

245
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:22,817
-Mommy!
-Stop that!

246
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:30,126
l don't like it when little girls cry.

247
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:44,268
lf you're good and you promise
to not run away...

248
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:46,935
...you can play with her.

249
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,226
-Where are you?
-l got him in the room.

250
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:08,992
-What took you so long?
-Problems.

251
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,696
-What kind of problems?
-He's difficult.

252
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:16,501
lt's just, he's not like
the other ones, okay?

253
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,473
He doesn't get it.

254
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:21,170
Okay. Okay.

255
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:24,314
-Put him on. I'll straighten it out.
-Okay.

256
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:32,687
-Phone call for you, Dr. Jennings.
-Hello?

257
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:36,225
-Dr. Will Jennings?
-This is Dr. Jennings. Who's this?

258
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:39,260
-You can call me Joe.
-Is my wife there?

259
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:42,832
Yeah. She's right here.
Right here with me.

260
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:47,336
You should see her face.
She's just starting to get the picture.

261
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,566
Would you like to talk to her?

262
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:52,267
Okay, but keep it short and sweet.

263
00:27:52,478 --> 00:27:57,347
This is actually my favorite part,
where the happy couples get to talk.

264
00:27:57,517 --> 00:27:59,075
-Will.
-Are you all right?

265
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:01,719
-They took Abby.
-I'll work this out.

266
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,788
Are you okay? Where are you?

267
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,359
You got a beautiful bedroom.
The view is unbelievable...

268
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:11,688
...inside and out.

269
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:18,065
l'm looking at a picture of Abby right now.
Let me tell you, l don't see you at all.

270
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:22,868
She's the spitting image of your wife.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

271
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:27,206
We've got a difficult situation.
Let me know what you need.

272
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:31,076
I'll make it happen quickly.
Anything you say.

273
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:36,712
This is your bedside manner, right, where
you talk to people like they're idiots...

274
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,619
...then you do whatever
the fuck you want.

275
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:43,888
Let me tell you, l am not
your fucking patient, all right?

276
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,661
l've upset you,
but l need you to listen.

277
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,600
-My daughter has asthma.
-Tell me something I don't know.

278
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:55,832
Three minutes without air
and Abby's brain starts to die.

279
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:59,170
Abby needs Karen
or she needs her medicine.

280
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:04,078
That is what is gonna put control
back in your hands.

281
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,178
Back in my hands?

282
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,317
l'm the doctor tonight.

283
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:20,594
l'm the one that decides whether or not
your little girl lives or dies.

284
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:26,771
Please don't make me prove it.
Now, put my partner back on.

285
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:36,278
How come we didn't know about
the asthma? How could you miss that?

286
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:39,849
-I don't like it.
-Like l give a shit what you like.

287
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:42,954
You just keep an eye on him,
all right?

288
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,583
Goodbye.

289
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,199
Who is that guy?

290
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,131
That's my husband.

291
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:09,744
l wonder if he knows what he's got.

292
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,670
Get your car keys.

293
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,944
lt's time to go.

294
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:41,636
Here, hop up.

295
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:50,088
Keep this wrapped around you
when we go outside.

296
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:52,781
The heater's busted.

297
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,885
Now, when we get back
from this little ride...

298
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:01,898
...you're gonna get to watch some TV
because you've been good.

299
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,465
What's the matter?

300
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:11,199
This is all...dusty.

301
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:13,868
-What?
-l can't--

302
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:17,072
-Dusty.
-Dusty? Here. There.

303
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,686
Look, it's gone. lt's gone.

304
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,950
Air. My chest. l can't breathe.

305
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:28,287
-My puffer.
-Your what?

306
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:31,930
My medicine. Mommy didn't leave me....

307
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:40,131
Coffee. They said coffee will help.
Coffee.

308
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:42,269
Mommy.

309
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:49,311
Hang on, sweetheart.

310
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:55,351
Okay. Time to put this on.

311
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,651
Go on. Put it around your eyes.

312
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:05,464
lt's almost 9:00.

313
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:14,265
Hang on, Katie.

314
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,774
Help me...Marvin.

315
00:32:30,957 --> 00:32:33,118
Here. Come on.

316
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:42,792
Help me. Mommy.

317
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:52,835
-Talk to me. l like your voice.
-What do you wanna talk about?

318
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:57,881
Well, why don't you tell me
how you met Dr. Will?

319
00:33:03,556 --> 00:33:07,390
You don't wanna talk about that, huh?
Sore subject?

320
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,393
Well, let's see if l can guess.

321
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:14,158
You were a nurse,
you put him through med school...

322
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,029
...and then you quit to have the baby.

323
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:20,028
How did you know that?

324
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:25,839
Well, l'm just an excellent judge
of character.

325
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:34,249
Are we here?

326
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:38,215
Marvin will be here soon.

327
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,452
You will not get emotional.
You will not freak out.

328
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:45,893
You'll give the kid her medicine,
then we'll go.

329
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,260
-l understand.
-Make sure you do.

330
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,368
l'm gonna have a gun on you
every second.

331
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:56,907
Abby's gonna go a little crazy when
you leave. You're gonna tough it out.

332
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:01,069
Just like the first day of school.
You remember that, right?

333
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:08,652
lf you flip out and if you try to run,
l will shoot you.

334
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:10,617
l'm not gonna shoot her.

335
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,884
l'm gonna shoot you
with her daddy's gun.

336
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,656
And she will have nightmares
for the rest of her life.

337
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:21,662
-Now, get your stuff.
-Mommy? Mommy!

338
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,967
-Abby?
-Mommy!

339
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,738
Oh, God.

340
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:42,020
Oh, my God.

341
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:44,520
Are you okay?

342
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:48,017
Mama's here.

343
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:51,759
-Let me see you.
-l had an attack.

344
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:53,330
You did?

345
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:56,092
Here you go, baby.

346
00:34:56,435 --> 00:35:00,030
-l didn't have any medicine.
-l have your medicine.

347
00:35:00,206 --> 00:35:02,037
-Where were you?
-Here.

348
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,841
One, two, three.

349
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:10,040
One more time. There you go.

350
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:15,620
You're gonna be fine, okay?
There you go, honey. Okay.

351
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,952
Let me see you. Okay.

352
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:24,426
-You doing okay?
-She nearly died, Joey.

353
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:28,465
-She scared me.
-She's got her medicine. She's fine.

354
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:33,503
-She's just like Katie.
-No, she's not. She's not.

355
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,470
She's another little girl.

356
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:41,477
She's some doctor's kid you give a pill to
and everything is fine. Understand me?

357
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:43,706
lt sounded the same.

358
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,241
lt's not the same, Marvin.

359
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:48,851
Here's some water right here.

360
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:56,089
-Did he hurt you?
-No.

361
00:35:56,262 --> 00:36:00,858
-He hasn't hurt you?
-No. l wanna go home.

362
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:04,560
l know, baby.
l know you wanna go home.

363
00:36:06,672 --> 00:36:10,836
Just a little bit longer, okay?
Then l'm gonna come get you.

364
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,912
-Okay.
-Put some warm clothes on.

365
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:18,682
-ls he nice, Abby?
-Yeah.

366
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:21,911
-Where is he keeping you?
-ln a cabin.

367
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:23,713
-A cabin?
-Yeah.

368
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:27,381
-ls it far from here?
-Not that far.

369
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:30,892
-No? Does he have a gun?
-No.

370
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,031
No gun?

371
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:38,226
Listen to me. You do everything he says.
But only if he's nice to you.

372
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:43,432
lf you go to the bathroom, go alone.
Don't let him go with you.

373
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:48,373
Listen to me. We had a little wrinkle,
but we're back on track now.

374
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:51,641
Just like the other four times.
ls that clear?

375
00:36:51,817 --> 00:36:55,878
-No. lt's different. The medicine--
-lt's not different.

376
00:36:56,055 --> 00:37:01,254
We've gone over this 1 00,000 times.
We're back to the plan.

377
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:07,889
l'm gonna talk to you every half-hour.
End of story. Are you okay?

378
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,660
Are you leaving me again?

379
00:37:10,836 --> 00:37:16,797
-l have to, baby. Just till the morning.
-Okay, time to go. Marvin?

380
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:22,809
l am begging you. Let me stay
with her till morning. Please.

381
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:26,918
See how nice l'm talking?
That's good for her to hear.

382
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,850
You don't want that to change, do you?

383
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:33,149
-Okay.
-Come on.

384
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:38,194
-Honey, you're gonna be fine.
-No! Mommy! Mommy!

385
00:37:38,364 --> 00:37:42,494
l love you, honey!
Her medicine! Her medicine!

386
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:44,601
-Mommy!
-l love you, baby!

387
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:59,278
Oh, God, no! Don't do this!
That is my baby!

388
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,655
Christ.

389
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,492
Fuck! Fuck!

390
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:19,899
Shit.

391
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:23,165
What, do you want to fuck this up?

392
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:27,403
Think you live in a world
where no little girls get killed?

393
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:29,513
Fuck!

394
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,119
Put this on.

395
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:56,000
You are one ballsy, motherfucking lady.
l'll give you that.

396
00:38:56,175 --> 00:38:59,702
And everybody's entitled
to one mistake.

397
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,643
Well, you just made yours.

398
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:16,557
-Baby, put the doc on.
-What are you doing?

399
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:20,562
-Kid got her medicine. Put the doc on.
-Where are you?

400
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:24,258
We're going back.
Would you put the fucking doc on?

401
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:29,703
lt's for you.

402
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,742
-Hello?
-Will. How you doing?

403
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:43,378
l got a little news update for you.
Here's the little lady.

404
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:46,217
-Will?
-Baby, are you okay?

405
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:50,590
-What's happening?
-We saw Abby. She had an attack.

406
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,732
-ls she all right?
-She's fine for now.

407
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:59,701
l left her medicine with her,
but she's miles away from a hospital.

408
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,935
Whoa! Calm down, college boy.
The kid got a little upset, that's all.

409
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:10,013
Mommy fixed it. There were some tears,
some screams. Everything's fine.

410
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:13,207
So listen. Have fun, okay?

411
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:36,030
Do you need a hankie, baby?

412
00:40:42,748 --> 00:40:44,648
You fuck!

413
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:47,349
How dare you?

414
00:40:52,524 --> 00:40:56,119
-What happened to you?
-l like it rough sometimes.

415
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:59,958
-You don't have that kind of fun?
-That's not from fun.

416
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:04,660
-That's a beating. And not just one.
-Really? lt is?

417
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,306
Will you drive me
to the battered women's shelter?

418
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,869
Put this on. Put it on.

419
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,214
Okay, Daddy.

420
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,186
-l need to ask you a question.
-Fuck you.

421
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,359
Are you really committed
to this kidnapping?

422
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,723
l think Joe gets his kicks
out of this, not you.

423
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:33,797
What makes you think
l would sell him out?

424
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:39,396
Stop trying to press my buttons
and let this happen like every other time.

425
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:44,167
This isn't like every other time.
Abby is sick and you missed that.

426
00:41:44,343 --> 00:41:51,010
What will you do if my daughter dies?
That is all l'm thinking about right now.

427
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:59,020
You want me to tell Joe you got
the gun on me when he calls?

428
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:11,626
Who's Katie?

429
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:13,464
Katie?

430
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,101
That's what you called me
when l was sick.

431
00:42:19,278 --> 00:42:23,271
She was a little girl just like you.

432
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,214
She's in heaven now.

433
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:34,620
l have a cat in heaven.

434
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:39,094
Were you her daddy?

435
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:45,168
She was my family...

436
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,734
...and my friend.

437
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,775
She died two years ago.

438
00:42:56,682 --> 00:43:01,142
You know, when you die
you stay the same age.

439
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,620
So she'll be 6 forever.

440
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:11,153
Hey, maybe she knows your cat.

441
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,127
That would be kind of a coincidence.

442
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:23,407
-Yeah.
-Hey, baby.

443
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:27,034
-We're almost back. ls everything cool?
-No, it's not.

444
00:43:27,613 --> 00:43:29,911
-He flipped out.
-What did he do?

445
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:32,610
He hit me.

446
00:43:37,122 --> 00:43:39,056
Put him on.

447
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:47,495
l'm sorry. l lost my head.
lt won't happen again.

448
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,793
What did you hit her with?

449
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:53,199
The phone. Not hard.

450
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:55,998
You need to listen now.

451
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,199
What are you doing?

452
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:01,539
Jesus, Karen!

453
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,444
Shit. Now l got blood on my phone.

454
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:11,953
Are we clear?
Do you understand how this works?

455
00:44:12,157 --> 00:44:16,753
-Please don't hurt my wife.
-Likewise, asshole.

456
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,664
Well, l did my good deed for the day.

457
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:27,771
l don't know about you,
but l'm famished.

458
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:31,567
l got an idea.
Why don't you go sit down...

459
00:44:31,743 --> 00:44:34,974
...and l'll make us dinner.
How's that sound?

460
00:44:35,113 --> 00:44:41,279
A little foreplay never hurt anybody.
All right, let's see what we got here.

461
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:45,913
No messages?

462
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:51,751
That's the great thing
about an anesthesiologist.

463
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,491
They don't have to deal
with any pesky patients.

464
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:58,898
Most doctors come home,
they got a million calls.

465
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,699
Will's got it all worked out,
doesn't he?

466
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:06,503
He comes home.
He's got plenty of time to kick back...

467
00:45:06,645 --> 00:45:11,742
...for a nice romantic dinner
with his trophy wife.

468
00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:16,310
l'm really sorry that--

469
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:19,888
l'm sorry that that had to happen.

470
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,758
l got an idea.

471
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:27,797
You got any makeup in here?

472
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:32,069
l'm gonna get you fixed up.

473
00:45:42,314 --> 00:45:44,305
There you go.

474
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,149
Pretty as new.

475
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,595
-Karen?
-lt's almost midnight.

476
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:10,173
-Who the fuck is that?
-My neighbor.

477
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:12,702
Karen?

478
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:17,280
All right. Answer the door, and act.
You got it?

479
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:21,442
-Just don't do anything crazy.
-That's up to you.

480
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,088
-Hi.
-Hi.

481
00:46:30,796 --> 00:46:33,287
Joan, it's late.
You should have called.

482
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:36,831
l saw your lights.
l'm on my way to pick up Billy.

483
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:40,096
When a sleepover goes bad,
you know what l mean.

484
00:46:40,238 --> 00:46:45,733
Since l'm out, l thought l'd pick up
that disc for the auction. Hey, Will.

485
00:46:48,714 --> 00:46:51,012
Sorry. l thought you were Will.

486
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,812
-No, Joan, this is--
-l'm Joe. l'm a friend of Will's.

487
00:46:57,756 --> 00:47:00,816
-Nice to meet you, Joe.
-Nice to meet you.

488
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:04,626
So where's Will?

489
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:11,727
Another conference. What else?
l'm gonna get you that disc.

490
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:16,135
l guess you should have told Joe.
Could have saved him a trip.

491
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:20,335
Karen and l can struggle along
without Will.

492
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:28,042
So how do you know Will?

493
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:33,090
We work together at Northside General.

494
00:47:33,258 --> 00:47:36,159
He means Astoria Memorial, downtown.

495
00:47:36,294 --> 00:47:39,957
Will hasn't worked at Northside
for over a year now.

496
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:43,793
-Yeah, that's where l met him.
-Yeah.

497
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:50,268
Joan...

498
00:47:51,476 --> 00:47:56,209
...Joe is my friend, not Will's.

499
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,583
So...

500
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,949
...l'd appreciate it...

501
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:12,620
...if you didn't mention this
to anyone, you know.

502
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,998
Of course not. l wouldn't--

503
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:22,071
-Of course not.
-Thanks.

504
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:27,401
-l'm gonna open some wine.
-Oh, jeez.

505
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:33,950
God, Karen.

506
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,020
Do you know what you're doing?

507
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:41,351
-Abby's not here, is she?
-She's upstairs. She's sleeping.

508
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,757
-Don't tell anybody about this, okay?
-l won't.

509
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:48,661
l had no idea you guys had problems.
Are you all right?

510
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:51,530
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-You look frazzled.

511
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,432
No, l'm fine. We can't talk right now.

512
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:00,134
We're about to have dinner. l'll talk
to you about it later. Here's the disc.

513
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,644
l'm here for you.

514
00:49:04,382 --> 00:49:06,179
Bye, Will.

515
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:10,121
-l mean, bye, Joe.
-Bye.

516
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,257
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

517
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:18,988
-Good night.
-He's kind of scary. l like that.

518
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,367
She's still watching us
through the window.

519
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:39,781
She buys it now. Don't fight me
or it's gonna look wrong.

520
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:41,579
Come on...

521
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:44,519
...give it all you got.

522
00:49:53,565 --> 00:49:55,897
You're good.

523
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,661
But you could be better.

524
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:10,237
l could have sworn she was out there.

525
00:50:10,415 --> 00:50:12,007
Yeah.

526
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:36,104
So you have a kid.

527
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:40,768
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-C-section scar.

528
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:43,778
No, l had an ovary taken out.

529
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:48,613
Wrong kind of scar. l'm a doctor.
l know what l'm looking at.

530
00:50:49,454 --> 00:50:52,617
How can you do this when
you have a kid of your own?

531
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:55,988
l mean, for God's sake,
bring this to an end.

532
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,862
Baby!

533
00:51:08,773 --> 00:51:13,369
That was good, if l do say so myself.

534
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:19,078
You should eat.
You need your strength.

535
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,284
God, l stink.

536
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:32,522
Well, let's see what big Will has here
in the laundry room for me to borrow.

537
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:52,508
So is this his sexy shirt?

538
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:57,112
ls this his ''Saturday morning,
let's get down to business...

539
00:51:57,288 --> 00:52:00,189
...make me feel
like l'm 2 1 again'' shirt?

540
00:52:00,358 --> 00:52:02,849
Let me guess.

541
00:52:03,028 --> 00:52:05,360
You guys do it...

542
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,467
...and then you end up wearing it.
Am l right?

543
00:52:14,205 --> 00:52:17,174
How does it look on me?

544
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:23,942
-How do you pick who you go after?
-Well, they gotta be rich.

545
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:27,483
They gotta have kids the right age.

546
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:30,819
And the moms have to be pretty.

547
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:34,390
And they have to be doctors, right?

548
00:52:34,993 --> 00:52:38,520
So where did you get your names from?

549
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,831
Where did you get your names?
How did you know Northside General?

550
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,471
Did you work there?
ls that how you know Will?

551
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:50,199
Where are you going?

552
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,176
What are you doing?

553
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,850
Come here.

554
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,809
Take a look.

555
00:53:29,814 --> 00:53:36,378
This is why we're not going to have
any trouble playing house tonight.

556
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,820
Come here.

557
00:54:38,683 --> 00:54:44,485
Does your wife know
that this is part of your plan?

558
00:54:50,795 --> 00:54:53,855
l've got no secrets from my wife.

559
00:55:07,979 --> 00:55:09,913
Let me do it.

560
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,911
ln the bathroom.

561
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,486
You shy?

562
00:55:30,835 --> 00:55:34,771
How can a woman
that looks like you be shy?

563
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:08,096
-You okay?
-Yeah, just a minute.

564
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:09,934
Okay.

565
00:56:29,961 --> 00:56:34,625
-Aren't you tired yet?
-My pills keep me up.

566
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,063
l'm kind of hungry.

567
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,567
Yeah, me too.

568
00:56:40,738 --> 00:56:45,300
Let's see.
There's soup in the microwave.

569
00:56:45,476 --> 00:56:46,841
Oh, there's popcorn.

570
00:56:47,011 --> 00:56:50,606
-We should have that with the movie.
-Okay.

571
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:53,941
Bathroom.

572
00:59:08,052 --> 00:59:10,384
You scared me.

573
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,387
Wow.

574
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,424
You are a beautiful woman.

575
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,794
What do you want to do?

576
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:36,312
Well, why don't you tell me
what you and Will do...

577
00:59:36,514 --> 00:59:39,278
...and we'll do the opposite.

578
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:47,785
You mind if we don't talk about him?

579
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:52,589
Hey, you know, no offence,
but from the looks of him...

580
00:59:53,097 --> 00:59:56,965
...l'd be surprised if he knew
what to do with you.

581
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:13,449
You think you do?

582
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:18,982
l'll tell you what.

583
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,657
l'm gonna let you
be the judge of that.

584
01:00:59,764 --> 01:01:01,595
Wow.

585
01:01:01,766 --> 01:01:05,065
You're not like the other moms.

586
01:01:18,783 --> 01:01:21,013
Close your eyes.

587
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:25,417
l like to watch.

588
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,076
Don't move. Not an inch.

589
01:03:00,685 --> 01:03:02,585
What's that?

590
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,278
lt's a scalpel, Joe.

591
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:09,183
lt will take your equipment off
so easy you'll barely even feel it.

592
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,726
Jesus Christ.

593
01:03:12,129 --> 01:03:15,326
Now, pick up that phone
and call Marvin.

594
01:03:18,636 --> 01:03:20,399
Like you've got the guts.

595
01:03:21,038 --> 01:03:24,599
l will castrate you
with no more thought...

596
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:27,507
...than slicing a chicken's neck.

597
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:32,042
-Do it!
-All right. All right.

598
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:35,014
Take it easy. Take it easy.

599
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:48,897
-Dial the number.
-What do you want me to say?

600
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:52,228
Tell Marvin you have the money.

601
01:03:52,436 --> 01:03:56,167
Tell him to put Abby in his truck
and drive her here.

602
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,240
-ls it ringing?
-Hang on.

603
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:00,001
ls it ringing?

604
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,777
Abby? lt's ready.

605
01:04:12,523 --> 01:04:15,287
Shit. He's not answering.

606
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:30,704
Abby!

607
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:32,775
Don't run away from me!

608
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:34,467
Abby!

609
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,940
Abby, don't run away!

610
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:42,951
-You dialed the wrong number.
-No, l swear to God.

611
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,815
Why isn't he picking up?

612
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:49,289
Abby! l told you not to run away!

613
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,257
-Why isn't he answering?
-The fuck do l know?

614
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,426
lt went to voice mail. Listen.

615
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:02,094
--is not available. Message CO 4.

616
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:04,998
-The cellular customer...
-Oh, my God.

617
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:08,269
-...is not available.
-Where is my daughter?

618
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:11,343
Where is my daughter, you--?

619
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,652
You cut me.

620
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:21,114
You fucking cut me.

621
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:23,989
Your kid is dead, bitch.

622
01:05:30,768 --> 01:05:34,033
Hey, you missed!

623
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:38,435
You fucking missed!

624
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:56,692
-Mommy!
-Abby, where are you?

625
01:05:56,961 --> 01:06:01,398
l don't know. ln the woods.
l ran outside.

626
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:04,563
Mommy, come get me.

627
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:07,362
Abby, listen to me.
Listen to your mom.

628
01:06:07,538 --> 01:06:12,066
Run. Run as fast as you can.
Find a road. Stop a car, and call 91 1 .

629
01:06:12,276 --> 01:06:16,042
-Just get out. Don't let him catch you.
-l'm scared.

630
01:06:16,213 --> 01:06:19,376
You'll be fine.
l'm coming to get you. Run.

631
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,074
Open the fucking door!

632
01:06:21,285 --> 01:06:23,651
-Abby!
-Mommy!

633
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:28,348
Open this fucking door!

634
01:06:32,596 --> 01:06:34,086
Mommy!

635
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:38,530
-Let go of me!
-Sorry, but she shouldn't have run away.

636
01:06:38,702 --> 01:06:42,570
-Open the fucking door!
-Put my baby back on the phone.

637
01:06:47,845 --> 01:06:51,941
You tell him to not hurt my daughter.

638
01:06:52,116 --> 01:06:53,708
Tell him.

639
01:06:55,352 --> 01:06:56,876
Marvin.

640
01:06:58,522 --> 01:07:02,322
lf you hear a shot, kill the kid.

641
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:20,138
You just made your second mistake.

642
01:07:30,788 --> 01:07:33,621
l need to use the bathroom.

643
01:07:35,392 --> 01:07:37,724
I hope they shrivel up
and fall off.

644
01:07:53,877 --> 01:07:58,644
I understand everything. I don't need
it explained to me. I live it.

645
01:07:58,882 --> 01:08:01,077
Sometimes I get a little upset.

646
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,989
Read that.

647
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:18,029
That's a message from my wife.

648
01:08:20,337 --> 01:08:22,703
-Where's Abby?
-l don't know.

649
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:25,932
You do.
You've done this four times before.

650
01:08:26,343 --> 01:08:28,971
Me not knowing is part of the plan.

651
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:33,708
This is succinylcholine.
lf l inject this, you'll be paralyzed.

652
01:08:34,051 --> 01:08:38,112
You'll see, hear, and think, but you
won't be able to move or breathe.

653
01:08:38,288 --> 01:08:39,550
The fuck are you doing?

654
01:08:39,723 --> 01:08:44,626
l have seen murderers turned into
babies by this. But you have a choice.

655
01:08:44,795 --> 01:08:50,131
Tell me where Joe is holding Abby,
or find out what it feels like to die.

656
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,828
lf l pull this trigger,
you will be dead.

657
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,240
Pull it.

658
01:09:02,546 --> 01:09:05,140
No! No! Fuck!

659
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:09,576
Don't fight it, Cheryl.

660
01:09:27,738 --> 01:09:31,230
l know you can hear me.
You're trying to struggle.

661
01:09:31,408 --> 01:09:34,241
Telling your arms to move,
but they won't.

662
01:09:34,411 --> 01:09:39,405
You want to breathe, but you can't.
Unless l give you the antidote.

663
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:48,755
lt's like living death, isn't it?

664
01:09:48,926 --> 01:09:52,225
Maybe you feel almost
as frightened as my girl.

665
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:57,231
We are going to do this over and over
until you tell me where she is...

666
01:09:57,434 --> 01:09:59,868
...or until l can't bring you back.

667
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:07,934
Remember what l told Joe.

668
01:10:08,112 --> 01:10:12,310
Three and a half minutes without air,
and the brain is dying.

669
01:10:12,549 --> 01:10:16,645
You're almost there, Cheryl.
Remember what this feels like.

670
01:10:19,123 --> 01:10:20,613
Shit.

671
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:58,057
Now, where's Abby?

672
01:11:01,331 --> 01:11:03,196
Where is she?

673
01:11:04,168 --> 01:11:06,762
ls that what my baby felt?

674
01:11:07,104 --> 01:11:08,594
What?

675
01:11:09,673 --> 01:11:15,168
ls that what my baby felt
when you killed her?

676
01:11:15,345 --> 01:11:17,711
What are you talking about?

677
01:11:19,216 --> 01:11:21,377
Get my wallet.

678
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,154
Turn it over.

679
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,399
Oh, God.

680
01:11:40,604 --> 01:11:44,199
-Katie Hickey.
-Yeah, Katie Hickey.

681
01:11:46,043 --> 01:11:47,738
You think l killed Katie?

682
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:52,809
-l know you did. The surgeon told me.
-Told you what?

683
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:57,852
You didn't resuscitate her right.
You didn't control her bleeding.

684
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:01,184
You didn't monitor her pressure.

685
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:06,921
Katie had Wilms' Tumor. The surgeon
had difficulty trying to remove it.

686
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:09,359
He cut into a major artery.

687
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:13,432
He said she was fine
and her operation went well.

688
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:17,630
He lied. He told you Katie died
in recovery to protect himself.

689
01:12:17,774 --> 01:12:21,005
So that you wouldn't think
it was his fault.

690
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:25,537
Jesus. And this is why you chose us.

691
01:12:26,783 --> 01:12:29,411
Joe wants revenge.

692
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:31,554
None of the kids get hurt.

693
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:37,088
Cheryl, you have to tell me
where my daughter is.

694
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:50,566
There's a cabin east of here,
somewhere in the Cascades.

695
01:12:55,545 --> 01:12:57,172
Okay.

696
01:12:57,614 --> 01:13:00,606
lt's time to make the call.

697
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:06,949
You think you're smarter...

698
01:13:07,124 --> 01:13:10,218
...than all the other moms...

699
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,688
...but you're not.

700
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:19,263
Because see, they didn't hurt me.

701
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:25,096
And their kids are still alive.

702
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:33,516
l want you to think about Marvin now.

703
01:13:34,017 --> 01:13:36,281
Sitting there...

704
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:38,216
...watching the clock.

705
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,084
Waiting.

706
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:57,964
lt's time.

707
01:14:02,946 --> 01:14:06,507
lt's time to play a game.

708
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:11,011
But first,
you have to close your eyes.

709
01:14:13,557 --> 01:14:15,184
Joe...

710
01:14:18,195 --> 01:14:20,789
...she's my daughter.

711
01:14:25,535 --> 01:14:28,060
She's my little girl.

712
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:43,314
Okay, now what you have to do...

713
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:47,821
...is you have to think nice thoughts.

714
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:50,186
Pretty thoughts.

715
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,989
l'm thinking about my mommy.

716
01:14:54,164 --> 01:14:58,692
Yeah, that's it. She's pretty.

717
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:03,571
She's pretty
and she loves you very much.

718
01:15:09,312 --> 01:15:14,750
Now, l want you to stay very still.

719
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:36,570
-Joey?
-Who the fuck else would it be?

720
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:40,774
You're late, Joey. You can't be late!

721
01:15:40,944 --> 01:15:44,209
l know,
but everything's all right now.

722
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:47,145
lt's gonna be over soon.

723
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:51,143
Just like the other times. Right?

724
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:57,053
-Right?
-Yeah, just like the other times.

725
01:16:11,374 --> 01:16:13,308
l'm gonna follow your plan.

726
01:16:15,979 --> 01:16:19,312
You don't have to worry about me.

727
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:25,183
And you'll get your money.

728
01:16:28,992 --> 01:16:33,190
Did you ever think that maybe
this wasn't about the money?

729
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,022
l mean...

730
01:16:36,266 --> 01:16:39,463
...did that ever cross your mind?

731
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:47,599
That a guy like me could be motivated
by something other than greed?

732
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,274
Hank? Wake up. lt's an emergency.

733
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,510
What happened?

734
01:16:54,718 --> 01:16:59,280
My child is in danger, but you
can help. You can't call the police.

735
01:16:59,723 --> 01:17:01,122
l don't understand.

736
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:05,693
My daughter was kidnapped.
lf l go to the police they'll kill her.

737
01:17:05,929 --> 01:17:07,988
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

738
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,156
They're using cell phones.

739
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:15,566
l'm praying a vice president
of Wirecell can trace those calls.

740
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,746
Can l go home now?

741
01:17:34,324 --> 01:17:36,155
Pretty soon.

742
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:39,222
Go home and see your mommy.

743
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:42,157
We have to wait for a phone call.

744
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:44,562
Then we can go.

745
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:47,234
Those are the rules.

746
01:17:49,372 --> 01:17:52,341
lt's funny that they
always do it the same...

747
01:17:52,509 --> 01:17:55,535
...with the clouds and the sun,
and flowers.

748
01:17:59,082 --> 01:18:02,609
She does the hands good, though,
you know.

749
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:07,914
They have trouble with that,
but she's good.

750
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:24,265
lt's a bad day, isn't it?

751
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:27,771
l know.

752
01:18:29,646 --> 01:18:31,910
l know you have kids, Joe.

753
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:41,580
Don't think that you know me.

754
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,722
Okay, come on.

755
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:55,132
Put a smile on. lt's showtime.

756
01:18:58,742 --> 01:19:00,903
-We've got something for you.
-Yeah?

757
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,046
-A phone logging on every 30 minutes.
-Where?

758
01:19:04,247 --> 01:19:08,547
lt's near a place called Zillah
in the Eastern Cascades.

759
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:12,121
We can put a tracing vehicle in
that's 45 minutes away.

760
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:15,656
-Do it. Do it.
-But to do that...

761
01:19:15,825 --> 01:19:18,453
...l gotta talk to somebody above me.

762
01:19:18,662 --> 01:19:21,324
-No.
-Bringing in the authorities.

763
01:19:21,564 --> 01:19:23,930
-You can't--
-You'll get us killed...

764
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,591
...when Joey finds out
you traced his calls.

765
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:29,966
Don't tell him.
Tell him the truth about Katie's death.

766
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:33,701
He won't believe what l say.
He'll say l betrayed him.

767
01:19:33,877 --> 01:19:36,812
l've got to phone him back
or he'll call the police.

768
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,346
lt's time to go to the bank.

769
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,815
You drive.

770
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,988
Hey, it's me.

771
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:54,187
Yeah, l know. We're on our way.

772
01:19:54,597 --> 01:19:57,293
What time's he gonna get there?

773
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,897
We'll be there.

774
01:20:15,985 --> 01:20:20,422
Morning, Gray. l can tell by the look,
you got that call from Will.

775
01:20:20,623 --> 01:20:23,251
$250,000 for a painting in cash.

776
01:20:23,426 --> 01:20:28,022
He needs it wired to the bank in
Seattle by 1 0, or it goes on auction.

777
01:20:34,671 --> 01:20:38,334
The money should be in Seattle by now.
Call and see.

778
01:20:38,508 --> 01:20:41,204
Fuck! We've got company.

779
01:20:42,579 --> 01:20:46,777
You're being paranoid.
lt could be a traffic chopper.

780
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:52,047
Fuck it. lt doesn't matter now, anyway.
Pull into that lot.

781
01:20:58,862 --> 01:21:01,524
-There's Cheryl.
-ls Abby with her?

782
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:04,667
Pull your window up.
All right, slow down.

783
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:08,293
l don't want her to panic.
Pull in right here.

784
01:21:12,475 --> 01:21:13,965
How you doing today?

785
01:21:14,444 --> 01:21:17,675
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

786
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:19,041
Stop!

787
01:21:19,215 --> 01:21:22,412
You got two seconds
to get in that fucking car!

788
01:21:24,287 --> 01:21:26,687
Lock the door!

789
01:21:41,504 --> 01:21:45,634
You see that?
You see those fucking assholes?

790
01:21:45,842 --> 01:21:48,106
l am a goddamn genius!

791
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:51,577
See you, boys! Happy hunting.

792
01:21:56,286 --> 01:22:00,222
You got seven minutes.
Don't make me call him.

793
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:07,256
-l'm Dr. Will Jennings.
-Mr. Hibbing wants to speak with you.

794
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:09,091
What for? l'm in a rush.

795
01:22:09,265 --> 01:22:13,167
lt'll only take a minute.
Just a formality. Follow me.

796
01:22:13,336 --> 01:22:17,136
Hello, Dr. Jennings.
As you can see, we have your money.

797
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,674
-Sit, please.
-l'm in a rush. What's the holdup?

798
01:22:21,244 --> 01:22:25,180
Dr. Jennings, l'm special agent
Bill Chalmers of the FBl.

799
01:22:25,348 --> 01:22:28,249
We got a tip your daughter
had been kidnapped.

800
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:31,750
-We'll help you get your daughter back.
-How?

801
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:35,322
The best chance of rescue
is at the ransom exchange.

802
01:22:35,758 --> 01:22:38,955
Our SWAT teams are trained
for this scenario.

803
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:44,395
But for them to do their job, they have
to hear what's going on at the drop.

804
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:46,865
We need you to wear a wire.

805
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:51,166
lf this guy knows you're involved,
he'll kill my daughter.

806
01:22:51,374 --> 01:22:57,006
We know what we're doing. Time is
running out. Will you wear the wire?

807
01:23:00,984 --> 01:23:02,008
All right.

808
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:12,586
What took you so long?

809
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:23,161
Out of sequence, no new bills.
Excellent. Stick it in this bag. Quick.

810
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:37,352
-You get the money yet?
-Yeah, l got it.

811
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,750
Anything you want to tell me?

812
01:23:40,924 --> 01:23:44,621
No. What the fuck
are you talking about?

813
01:23:45,895 --> 01:23:48,523
-Nothing.
-We're going back to the hotel.

814
01:23:48,698 --> 01:23:51,690
-Where's the meeting?
-Don't worry about that now.

815
01:23:51,868 --> 01:23:55,463
Fly out of Seattle, commercial.
Use your cold passport.

816
01:23:55,638 --> 01:23:58,869
Marvin and l will meet you
at the destination.

817
01:23:59,042 --> 01:24:01,567
Why? We're supposed
to travel together.

818
01:24:01,744 --> 01:24:06,841
There's been complications. This
is better for everyone. lt's safer.

819
01:24:06,983 --> 01:24:10,976
No, don't change the fucking plan!
Don't break your own rules.

820
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,586
That's how you get in trouble.

821
01:24:13,756 --> 01:24:19,422
-Don't break your own fucking rules!
-l make the fucking rules, all right?

822
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:24,090
And l can fucking break them!
Shut up and do what you're told!

823
01:24:24,968 --> 01:24:26,458
For fuck's sake.

824
01:24:27,937 --> 01:24:30,269
Joey, what are you doing?

825
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,108
You're not gonna hurt anybody, right?

826
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,268
We don't need to do that.
We don't hurt people.

827
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:38,970
l got the money. We are home free.

828
01:24:39,182 --> 01:24:42,913
-We did what we needed to do.
-Right. Absolutely.

829
01:24:43,086 --> 01:24:45,782
Hurt anybody?
What are you talking about?

830
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:49,015
What makes you think l'll hurt anybody?

831
01:24:49,192 --> 01:24:51,786
This is just a cleaner exit. That's all.

832
01:24:52,261 --> 01:24:57,392
lt's just a cleaner exit.
l got a surprise for you, baby.

833
01:24:57,934 --> 01:25:00,027
lt's like a--

834
01:25:00,536 --> 01:25:03,937
lt's like a once
in a lifetime thing, man.

835
01:25:04,107 --> 01:25:07,838
It's gonna be great down there.
Fucking great.

836
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:14,173
-Look, l gotta get off now, all right.
-No, Joey, don't go! Don't go!

837
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:16,009
l'll see you later.

838
01:25:21,724 --> 01:25:24,352
What's going on?

839
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:30,798
You can't pretend anymore. You know
what he'll do if you don't stop him.

840
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:37,637
l can't stall. l gotta bring you back
to the hotel. He's gonna call randomly.

841
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:41,834
Look, you have to convince Joe
that l didn't kill Katie.

842
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:46,505
l'll help you get out of this.
With your money, conscience and Joey.

843
01:25:46,716 --> 01:25:52,052
But you have to tell him the truth
about Katie. You have to stop him.

844
01:26:02,465 --> 01:26:05,229
-It's Cheryl.
-You're breaking the rules.

845
01:26:05,468 --> 01:26:08,869
No, listen to me.
lt's Joey who's breaking the rules.

846
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:14,066
Joey will hurt that little girl.
He might kill her. We have to help him.

847
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:19,246
-You're not supposed to call me.
-Marvin. Marvin!

848
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,728
He killed the wire.

849
01:26:32,895 --> 01:26:36,763
All units maintain visual
on the target, but don't approach.

850
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,760
Look, l have an idea.

851
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:45,904
Drive me to the waterfront.

852
01:26:49,112 --> 01:26:52,878
Get the front desk manager, Mr. Holden.
lt's an emergency.

853
01:26:53,249 --> 01:26:54,910
Hurry.

854
01:26:56,018 --> 01:26:59,749
-This is Mr. Holden, may I help you?
-This is Dr. Jennings.

855
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:04,655
-We spoke yesterday.
-Yes. We're set up for the conference.

856
01:27:04,827 --> 01:27:07,022
lt's not that. l'm not there now...

857
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:11,326
...but l need someone to think l am.
Can you forward my calls?

858
01:27:12,101 --> 01:27:14,331
-Yes, l can arrange that.
-Great.

859
01:27:53,209 --> 01:27:56,201
Puget Grand Hotel.
Dr. William Jennings' room?

860
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,115
-Thank you.
-One moment, please.

861
01:28:04,287 --> 01:28:06,517
-Where are we going?
-To Zillah.

862
01:28:06,689 --> 01:28:10,022
lt's the only thing l know to do
at this point.

863
01:28:11,227 --> 01:28:16,529
-lt's Joey. ls it for you or me?
-First call. lt's for me, that's my guess.

864
01:28:16,699 --> 01:28:20,226
Can't let him hear the plane.
l gotta cut the engine.

865
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:26,699
-Hello?
-Hey, there, college boy.

866
01:28:26,909 --> 01:28:29,537
Just checking
to make sure you're there.

867
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:36,544
Stay put, now.

868
01:28:36,752 --> 01:28:37,980
Okay.

869
01:28:52,935 --> 01:28:58,032
lt's okay. We've got enough altitude
as long as the calls are quick.

870
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:10,751
Abby and Marvin should be just
a couple of miles up ahead now.

871
01:29:18,427 --> 01:29:20,361
Hey, Abby.

872
01:29:21,797 --> 01:29:24,425
l made you something.

873
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:40,048
This will be for you.

874
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,908
-Ready?
-Yes.

875
01:29:51,694 --> 01:29:55,425
Wait. l called the doc's room.
How did l get you?

876
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:58,725
l'm just leaving
the hotel right now, baby.

877
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:02,462
-You fucking with me?
-No, are you fucking with me?

878
01:30:02,638 --> 01:30:07,405
-Where are we gonna meet?
-Okay, okay. lt's okay.

879
01:30:07,610 --> 01:30:09,805
Okay, listen to me, baby.

880
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:14,245
You trust me? Are you still my baby?

881
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:18,711
-Are you still my little girl?
-Yes, l'm still your baby.

882
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:25,026
l love you.
l love you so much.

883
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,456
Put the doc on.

884
01:30:28,731 --> 01:30:30,631
-Hello?
-Hey, Will.

885
01:30:31,434 --> 01:30:35,097
You're never gonna see your kid again.

886
01:30:38,274 --> 01:30:40,742
Pull it up! Pull it up!

887
01:30:41,177 --> 01:30:42,644
Jesus!

888
01:31:12,074 --> 01:31:15,271
Jesus. Thank God.

889
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:24,644
This is Dr. Jennings.
FBl agents, please respond.

890
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:28,381
-You can't talk to the FBl.
-Special Agent Summers.

891
01:31:28,557 --> 01:31:32,857
My daughter's in a moving truck on l-5.
They're gonna kill her.

892
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:37,159
-You have to set down on the highway.
-Negative. We're in a chopper.

893
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:42,327
-Ground unit's only 20 minutes away.
-That's too long! Set down now!

894
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:47,206
Tighten your seatbelt.

895
01:32:03,259 --> 01:32:06,319
There's the road.
They're down there somewhere.

896
01:32:06,595 --> 01:32:10,258
Keep your eyes peeled
for Marvin's pickup truck.

897
01:32:46,068 --> 01:32:48,593
What the fuck is this guy doing?

898
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:53,132
Wait a minute. That's Will, isn't it?

899
01:32:54,643 --> 01:32:57,737
That's the fucking doc, isn't it?
Answer me!

900
01:33:04,153 --> 01:33:07,816
-There's Marvin. lt must be Marvin.
-Are you sure?

901
01:33:08,023 --> 01:33:10,116
Brown truck.

902
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:21,797
Fuck!

903
01:33:28,344 --> 01:33:30,278
What are you doing?

904
01:33:34,016 --> 01:33:37,975
-What's wrong? lt's not time yet.
-You see this fucking guy?

905
01:33:38,187 --> 01:33:40,553
-You see a plane?
-No!

906
01:33:47,229 --> 01:33:49,026
Fucking bitch!

907
01:33:52,368 --> 01:33:54,495
Watch out!

908
01:34:40,349 --> 01:34:42,544
What are you gonna do?

909
01:35:25,127 --> 01:35:26,924
Cheryl, jump!

910
01:35:27,129 --> 01:35:28,289
Jump!

911
01:35:42,645 --> 01:35:44,306
Abby.

912
01:35:46,915 --> 01:35:51,682
Abby, get out. Get out! Run fast!

913
01:36:05,868 --> 01:36:06,960
Daddy!

914
01:36:08,203 --> 01:36:10,137
Daddy!

915
01:36:10,339 --> 01:36:12,136
Daddy!

916
01:36:13,609 --> 01:36:15,600
No!

917
01:36:25,621 --> 01:36:27,987
Where's my little girl?!

918
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:31,718
-Where's Abby?!
-l don't know.

919
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,827
-What do you mean?
-Because l don't know!

920
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:43,900
FBl! l need you to drop that gun.

921
01:36:46,975 --> 01:36:48,806
Joey.

922
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:50,603
Joey!

923
01:36:53,482 --> 01:36:55,643
Guess what, doc?

924
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:59,644
You don't get to die today...

925
01:36:59,822 --> 01:37:04,156
...because l want you to spend
the rest of your fucking life...

926
01:37:04,326 --> 01:37:06,419
...feeling like l feel!

927
01:37:06,628 --> 01:37:10,155
You're wrong about how Katie died.
l didn't kill her!

928
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:12,357
-Joey!
-Get a car!

929
01:37:12,534 --> 01:37:14,331
Don't do it!

930
01:37:15,237 --> 01:37:16,898
Fuck.

931
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:28,748
Please don't hurt me.

932
01:37:42,598 --> 01:37:44,725

933
01:37:46,869 --> 01:37:48,666
Abby!

934
01:37:50,539 --> 01:37:53,064
Abby? Abby!

935
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:01,105
Where are you, honey?

936
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:04,685
Daddy's okay.
He sent me to come find you.

937
01:38:04,953 --> 01:38:06,250
Abby.

938
01:38:06,455 --> 01:38:08,218

939
01:38:11,393 --> 01:38:13,987
-There you are.

Baby, remember when l told you

943
01:38:26,308 --> 01:38:28,139
Yeah.

944
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,771
-She's it.
-What does that mean?

945
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:36,918
We're gonna be a family again.
You and me and her.

946
01:38:37,085 --> 01:38:40,748
No, baby. We'll leave her right here
with her parents.

947
01:38:40,923 --> 01:38:43,858
-We're taking her with us.
-We can have our own!

948
01:38:44,092 --> 01:38:48,995
Marvin! You fucking stupid?
You believe him before you believe me!

949
01:38:49,231 --> 01:38:54,726
-She's just as innocent as Katie was.
-Listen! Are you coming with me...

Fuck! Fuck!
Where the fuck is the medicine?!

01:39:38,146 --> 01:39:39,909
Marvin, give her to me.

01:39:43,719 --> 01:39:45,687
-She's sick.
-Abby.

965
01:39:45,888 --> 01:39:48,584
Put her down

Abby. She can't breathe.
You have to give her to me!

01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:24,359

968
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:27,586
-Karen, where's her medicine?
-Mommy.

974
01:40:49,418 --> 01:40:53,411
-Ready? lnhale.
-Breathe! Sit up.

975
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:57,389
You need more?
Here, once more. Here you go.

976
01:41:02,931 --> 01:41:04,956
Come on, baby.

977
01:41:19,381 --> 01:41:21,315
Daddy?
