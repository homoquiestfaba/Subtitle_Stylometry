  Tu es uma cabra hipócrita.

00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,430
         - temos um encontro com
            duas rosas raras. 

18
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,664
- duas das rosa raras.      

19
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,666
       RAMONA é tudo o que 
        procuro numa rapariga.              

20
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,970
  Eu queria ir com ela,
    E então, ela não veio.   

21
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,805
   Então, você não quer vir
            Hoje?            

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,007
              - não.             

23
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,675
                   

24
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,177
     

        

26
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,815
      

27
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,517
        
37
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,738
    - Ela não vem.         
         - Ela vem.        

38
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,173
    - Ela não vem.         

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,109
Eu estava a espera desta menina
Eu conhecia no Tantra para ir a um encontro.

40
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,211
     Ela tem um pouco de medo
 Ou algo assim, um pouco nervosa
,

41
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,345
         Não compareceu.        

42
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,081
      Ela não responde.      


44
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,318
        - Estou chateado.       

45
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,520
      Eu arranjei estas flores,
       cortei o cabelo.        

46 
00:01:28,588 -> 00:01:29,521 
  Eu queria sair com ela. 

47 
00:01:29,589 -> 00:01:31,356 
  E depois ... Ela não veio. 

48 
00:01:31,424 -> 00:01:33,692 
    - VAMOS AGORA. 
SE Quiseres, Vem COM agente. 

49 
00:01:33,760 -> 00:01:36,328 
    Como - como você pode vir 
  Comer com agente, não há problema. 

50 
00:01:36,396 -> 00:01:37,963 
      - É um golpe para mim, 
      Você sabe o que significa? 

51 
00:01:38,031 -> 00:01:39,932 
  É - é como se eu fosse um pontapé 
         No estômago. 


54 
00:01:45,105 -> 00:01:46,438 
            - ELOGIOS. 
    - Basta dizer, filho. 

55 
00:01:46,506 -> 00:01:48,373 
    - Ao seu aniversário, JOSE. 
         FELIZ ANIVERSÁRIO! 

56 
00:01:48,441 -> 00:01:49,875 
- OBRIGADO pela hospitalidade. 
            

57 
00:01:49,943 -> 00:01:51,410 
    - Era o aniversário de José, 

58 
00:01:51,478 - 00:01:52,878> 
Então, eu queria convida-lo 
        Para jantar, 

59 
00:01:52,946 -> 00:01:54,446 
    E eu queria que Ron e SAM 
            Viessem,  

61 
00:01:55,815 -> 00:01:57,382 
 Rony e SAM são meus melhores amigos 
         Nesta casa. 

62 
00:01:57,450 -> 00:01:58,684 
              - OH! 

63 
00:01:58,751 -> 00:02:00,452 
- Yo, Cinco alto! Cinco alto! 

64 
00:02:00,520 -> 00:02:02,654 
         - Cinco alto-LO! 
         - Cinco alto-LO! 

65 
00:02:02,722 -> 00:02:04,890 
         - Cinco alto-LO! 
         - Cinco alto-LO! 

66 
00:02:04,958 -> 00:02:06,725 
     - OBRIGADO, OBRIGADO. 
    
67 
00:02:06,793 -> 00:02:08,160 
     - Obrigado por ter vindo, 
            VOCÊ SABIA? 

68 
00:02:08,228 -> 00:02:10,295 
  HEY, E OBRIGADO POR gostarem
   de mim, HOSPITALIDADE, 
 
69 
00:02:10,363 -> 00:02:12,297 
    Você sabe, como, honestamente, 
        Você sabe, como - 

70 
00:02:12,365 -> 00:02:13,632 
      Eu aprecio isso, meu

71 
00:02:13,700 -> 00:02:15,367 
  - Infelizmente, sinto-me melhor 
        Depois de disser ao JOSE 

72 
00:02:15,435 -> 00:02:17,202 
 acerca de mim de ter dormido 
         com o vinny, 

73 
00:02:17,270 -> 00:02:18,570 
      Acho que ele ficou chateado. 

76 
00:02:26,746 -> 00:02:28,881 
Eu realmente não acho que preciso 
    De dizer nada a ninguém. 

77 
00:02:28,948 -> 00:02:31,049 
        - Eu tenho meu desejo. 
        - AWW! OBRIGADO. 

78 
00:02:31,117 -> 00:02:32,718
         Eu tenho meu desejo. 

79 
00:02:32,785 -> 00:02:35,354 
     - Eu vou á casa de banho 
            - Eu também. 

80 
00:02:35,421 -> 00:02:37,422 
      - Oh, sim. Ah, sim. 
        - Oh, sim. 

81 
00:02:37,490 -> 00:02:38,924 
        - Oh, sim. 
        - Oh, sim. 

82 
00:02:38,992 -> 00:02:40,459 
      - olha isso por mim? 

83 
00:02:42,228 -> 00:02:43,829 
     - Você sabe, nós não - 
    Não estamos juntos, 

86 
00:02:47,901 -> 00:02:49,201 
             - Sim. 

87 
00:02:49,269 -> 00:02:50,669 
    - Você sabe, é - 
      NÃO é um grande negócio, 

88 
00:02:50,737 -> 00:02:52,204 
      MAS AO MESMO TEMPO, 
Ela está dizendo a mim, você sabe, 

89 
00:02:52,272 -> 00:02:53,772 
     NÃO SEJA ***** ***** 
        Com outras meninas, 

90 
00:02:53,840 -> 00:02:55,474 
        Então estou pensando, 
  "Ela está montando REGRAS SOBRE MIM, 

91 
00:02:55,542 -> 00:02:56,909 
    Então o que o ***** - " 
     - Ela disse isso para você? 

92 
00:02:56,976 -> 00:02:58,410 
        - Oh, sim, cara. 
- Ela não me disse isso. 

93 
00:02:58,478 -> 00:02:59,778 
          - Oh, cara - 
     - Ela não disse isso. 

94 
00:02:59,846 -> 00:03:01,013 
      Saltou essa parte 
          Da história. 

95 
00:03:01,080 -> 00:03:02,381 
 - O quê? Sim, claro, bro. 

96 
00:03:02,448 -> 00:03:04,116 
- Ela passou de CAPÍTULO PRIMEIRO 
        Para o capítulo três. 

97 
00:03:04,184 -> 00:03:05,484 
  - Vem, cara. VOCÊ SABe ... 

98 
00:03:05,552 -> 00:03:07,386 
    Esta não é minha PRIMEIRA VEZ 
     Em torno do bloco, cara. 

99 
00:03:07,453 -> 00:03:08,754 
      Você sabe o que significa? 

100 
00:03:08,821 -> 00:03:11,924 
    Não é por nada, eu só - 
    Eu - eu apenas fiz o que ela - 

101 
00:03:11,991 -> 00:03:14,226 
    Sabe, o que era - 
cara, respeitando, VOCÊ sabe? 

102 
00:03:14,294 -> 00:03:15,627 
Respeitar uns aos outros, mas ... 

103 
00:03:15,695 -> 00:03:17,462 
**** cara, você sabe? 
    Não estamos juntos. 

104 
00:03:17,530 -> 00:03:19,464 
    - JOSE é definitivamente 
         está a jogar. 

105 
00:03:19,532 -> 00:03:22,167 
          Como um piano. 
           
107 
00:03:23,469 -> 00:03:25,037 
     - Meu favorito é ... 
             - Tchau! 

108 
00:03:25,104 -> 00:03:27,472 
  Agora vamos a pé para casa. 
          feliz aniversário. 

109 
00:03:28,608 -> 00:03:29,775 
          - Oh, meu Deus. 

110 
00:03:47,660 -> 00:03:48,627 
             - Sim. 

111 
00:03:48,695 -> 00:03:52,664 
- Angelina, ela é minha ... amiga, 

112 
00:03:52,732 -> 00:03:55,334 
  Mas eu não confio que menina. 

113 
00:03:55,401 -> 00:03:57,069 
     Ela apenas diz uma coisa 
      MAS vai fazer outra. 

114 
00:04:02,308 -> 00:04:03,342 
        - Ei, ei, ei.   

116 
00:04:11,951 -> 00:04:13,485 
      - HEY bem vindos de volta. 

117 
00:04:13,553 -> 00:04:14,820 
    - Quando eu voltei, 
    Vinny estava chateado. 

118 
00:04:14,887 -> 00:04:16,355 
  Eu odeio ver o VINNY chatiado, 
        Eu realmente odeio, 

119 
00:04:16,422 -> 00:04:17,756 
Ele é como um irmão mais novo 
             PARA MIM. 

120 
00:04:17,824 -> 00:04:19,458 
 Yo, eu NÃO ACREDITO que aquela miúda 
     Realmente fez isso, como, 

121 
00:04:19,525 -> 00:04:21,193 
   PORQUE que ELA - POR 
  Que ela diria que ela vai GO 

122 
00:04:21,261 -> 00:04:23,462 
  E NÃO - Isso é loucura, LIKE 
 Por que você não ser real? 

123 
00:04:23,529 -> 00:04:24,630 
        LIKE, NADA. 
            - Eu sei. 

124 
00:04:24,697 -> 00:04:26,031 
Assim que eu tenho o telefone, 
            Eu sou assim, 

125 
00:04:26,099 -> 00:04:28,400 
      Há provavelmente LIKE 
Uma possibilidade de 85% do seu não vir. 

126 
00:04:28,468 -> 00:04:29,935 
         - High five TI. 

127 
00:04:30,003 -> 00:04:32,004 
            - OLÁ! 
 - Oh, o UP? Como foi o jantar? 

128 
00:04:32,071 -> 00:04:33,205 
             - Bom. 
         - Foi bom. 

129 
00:04:33,273 -> 00:04:34,139 
      Como foi seu jantar? 
      - Bom. Foi bom. 

130 
00:04:34,207 -> 00:04:35,340 
            - Sério? 

131 
00:04:35,408 -> 00:04:36,908 
    - Você está bem, mano? 
        - Sim, eu estou bem. 

132 
00:04:36,976 -> 00:04:38,677 
    - Vinny, VOCÊ SABE, 
        Ele vai CRAZY. 

133 
00:04:38,745 -> 00:04:40,245 
  Ele é como, "[bleep], eu olho, 
         LIKE, retardado. 

134 
00:04:40,313 -> 00:04:42,180 
    "Eu fui e tenho flores, 
         Cortou o cabelo, 

135 
00:04:42,248 -> 00:04:44,082 
MADE reservas para o jantar. " 

136 
00:04:44,150 -> 00:04:45,550 
  Eu tenho que ir na sala Smush 
          Por um segundo. 

137 
00:04:45,618 -> 00:04:46,518 
     E me sinto mal por ele. 

138 
00:04:46,586 -> 00:04:48,553 
Então, hum, eu, uh, DINHEIRO VINNY Esquerda, 

139 
00:04:48,621 -> 00:04:51,023 
  E eu dei as flores para SAM 
    VINNY QUE COMPRARAM. 

140 
00:04:51,090 -> 00:04:52,257 
     - Yo, o que começou. 

141 
00:04:52,325 -> 00:04:54,159 
          - [Rindo] 

142 
00:04:54,227 -> 00:04:55,794 
     - OLHA O QUE VOCÊ TEM. 

143 
00:04:57,130 -> 00:04:58,797 
      OLHE O QUE ELE TEM QUE. 

144 
00:04:58,865 -> 00:05:00,365 
     - Estes não são para mim. 

145 
00:05:00,433 -> 00:05:02,334 
        - Só Deus sabe 
        QUE sobre estes, 

146 
00:05:02,402 -> 00:05:04,202 
Porque eles foram APENAS na cama 
        Por três horas. 

147 
00:05:04,270 -> 00:05:07,339 
  Você tem meu CRIANÇAS lá, 
        CRIANÇAS Mike. 

148 
00:05:07,407 -> 00:05:09,041 
      YOU GOT SUCO Snooki. 

149 
00:05:09,108 -> 00:05:10,842 
- Você não distingui-los 
            VOCÊ MESMO. 

150 
00:05:10,910 -> 00:05:12,277 
    - Eu ainda pago por eles. 
             - AWW! 

151 
00:05:12,345 -> 00:05:13,779 
 - Não se pensava nisso, 
              BRO. 

152 
00:05:13,846 -> 00:05:15,781 
        - Não importa. 
     Eu paguei por eles. - NÃO. 

153 
00:05:15,848 -> 00:05:18,550 
  - Honestamente, eu estava apenas sendo 
 Um burro, para ser honesto com você. 

154 
00:05:18,618 -> 00:05:21,153 
    TI realmente não - 
 Eu não lhe deu as flores. 

155 
00:05:21,220 -> 00:05:23,121 
        - Adeus, boa noite. 
          - Boa noite. 

156 
00:05:23,189 -> 00:05:24,756 
      - Venha aqui. 
        VAMOS PARA A CAMA. 

157 
00:05:24,824 -> 00:05:26,692 
    - TER UM GRANDE DIA. 
    - Obrigado, querida. 

158 
00:05:26,759 -> 00:05:27,993 
  - ONDE VOCÊ QUER DORMIR 
        AGORA? 

159 
00:05:28,061 -> 00:05:29,328 
- Querida, onde você quiser. 

160 
00:05:29,395 -> 00:05:31,029 
Eu pensei que estávamos indo dormir 
    NA SALA, 

161 
00:05:31,097 -> 00:05:32,931 
 MAS SE VOCÊ NÃO QUERO DORMIR 
 Lá, vamos dormir na sua cama. 

162 
00:05:32,999 -> 00:05:35,167 
  - JOSE definitivamente queria, UH, 
          ANIVERSÁRIO DO SEXO. 

163 
00:05:35,234 -> 00:05:36,935 
            [Risos] 

164 
00:05:37,003 -> 00:05:39,237 
SO UM, como ele era, "Let's Stay 
NA SALA DE HOJE Smush ". 

165 
00:05:39,305 -> 00:05:41,306 
     Eu era como, "OK, tudo bem." 
         SO ... VOCÊ SABE. 

166 
00:05:41,374 -> 00:05:42,941 
    Eu definitivamente não acho que 
    Esta cama é, LIKE 

167 
00:05:43,009 -> 00:05:44,543 
        BOM para dormir. 

168 
00:05:44,610 -> 00:05:47,813 
Eu só precisava ter a certeza 
 SALA o maldito não estava sujo. 

169 
00:05:47,880 -> 00:05:49,247 
Você não acha que é, como, 
             Encardido, 

170 
00:05:49,315 -> 00:05:50,682 
LIKE, dormir nesta cama 
        AGORA? 

171 
00:05:50,750 -> 00:05:52,517 
        - Se não - 
     - Tudo bem, Just Go - 

172 
00:05:52,585 -> 00:05:56,521 
  Basta colocar - meter por cima. 
    Eu já volto. 

173 
00:05:56,589 -> 00:05:58,657 
         INFELIZMENTE, 
    Eu estava realmente cansado. 

174 
00:05:58,725 -> 00:06:02,227 
  VOCÊ SABIA? SIMILAR - Além disso, era 
 QUE TIME DO MÊS PARA MIM. 

175 
00:06:02,295 -> 00:06:03,395 
        [Tosse] 

176 
00:06:08,101 -> 00:06:09,334 
Mas, quero dizer, não me interpretem mal, 

177 
00:06:09,402 -> 00:06:10,936 
      Eu sinto que o miúdo 
    Realmente atraente, 

178 
00:06:11,003 -> 00:06:12,704 
      ELE é o meu tipo de cara, 
    Mas eu sou a mulher, 

179 
00:06:12,772 -> 00:06:15,574 
Então eu escolher e escolher QUANDO EU QUERO 
     Ter relações sexuais com um cara. 

180 
00:06:15,641 -> 00:06:17,709 
        [Pigarro] 

181 
00:06:23,750 -> 00:06:24,883 
             [Suspira] 

182 
00:06:24,951 -> 00:06:26,651 
SEXO NO ANIVERSÁRIO DE JOSÉ, desculpe. 

183 
00:06:32,191 -> 00:06:40,732 
            ¶ ¶ 

184 
00:06:42,869 -> 00:06:44,903 
  - Como diabos eu acordar 
    E meu cabelo é feito ainda? 

185 
00:06:44,971 -> 00:06:46,371 
    NÃO ENTENDO 
        O que está acontecendo. 

186 
00:06:52,011 -> 00:06:53,145 
- Me ligar mais tarde, certo? 

187 
00:06:53,212 -> 00:06:54,346 
          - Tudo bem, 
      Eu te ligo mais tarde. 

188 
00:06:54,414 -> 00:06:55,414 
    - Tudo bem, querida, 
         Divirta-se hoje. 

189 
00:06:55,481 -> 00:06:56,648 
         - Feliz Dia B! 

190 
00:06:56,716 -> 00:06:57,883 
 Lamento que não poderia ir CRAZY, 
             MAS ... 

191 
00:06:57,950 -> 00:06:58,884 
          - Eu me diverti. 

192 
00:06:58,951 -> 00:07:00,318 
  - Eu não estou apaixonada por JOSE. 

193 
00:07:00,386 -> 00:07:01,453 
    Eu estou gostando da KID 

194 
00:07:01,521 -> 00:07:03,789 
    Mas eu não iria tão longe 
         COMO DIZER AMOR. 

195 
00:07:03,856 -> 00:07:06,625 
          - Uh, ANGE ... 

196 
00:07:06,692 -> 00:07:08,293 
      Tudo bem, garota? 
            - Cansado. 

197 
00:07:08,361 -> 00:07:10,562 
    - Angelina DO SMASH 
     Quadro de pontuação, não é? 

198 
00:07:10,630 -> 00:07:11,997 
             - Sim. 

199 
00:07:12,064 -> 00:07:13,632 
             - Sim. 
  - O QUE É A MINHA PONTUAÇÃO AGORA? 

200 
00:07:13,699 -> 00:07:16,468 
    - VOCÊ - VOCÊ ESTÁ 1-0. 

201 
00:07:16,536 -> 00:07:17,702 
            - NÃO, 2. 

202 
00:07:17,770 -> 00:07:19,504 
    - VOCÊ SÓ esmagado Vinny. 

203 
00:07:19,572 -> 00:07:20,906 
        - NÃO, JOSE. 

204 
00:07:20,973 -> 00:07:23,074 
 - Você quebrou ÚLTIMA NOITE JOSE? 
             - Sim. 

205 
00:07:23,142 - 00:07:26,878> 
- SMASH VINNY um dia, e 
  O dia seguinte, você SMASH JOSE. 

206 
00:07:26,946 -> 00:07:28,513 
    - Pelo menos ele tem isso em. 
      - Você quebrou HOMENS? 

207 
00:07:28,581 -> 00:07:29,815 
        - Eles fizeram. 

208 
00:07:29,882 -> 00:07:31,450 
      Ela admitiu JOSE 
QUE VINNY ensacamento, CERTO? 

209 
00:07:31,517 -> 00:07:32,551 
        - Disse José? 

210 
00:07:32,618 -> 00:07:33,819 
        - Ela fez. 
             - Sim. 

211 
00:07:33,886 -> 00:07:35,253 
          - E sabia 
 Que se ele fosse para casa com ela, 

212 
00:07:35,321 -> 00:07:36,421 
    Que ela iria BANG, 

213 
00:07:36,489 -> 00:07:38,223 
    PORQUE ela bateu VINNY 
    Na noite anterior - 

214 
00:07:38,291 -> 00:07:40,125 
  - E ELE NÃO DÊ A [bleep] 
     SOBRE ELA. É por isso. 

215 
00:07:40,193 -> 00:07:42,360 
- Sim. Então ele foi, "eu sou 
Definitivamente ficando traseiros esta noite. " 

216 
00:07:42,428 -> 00:07:43,728 
        - Exatamente. 
Ele só quer Get It In. 

217 
00:07:43,796 -> 00:07:45,931 
    - Se ele teria se importado 
        Sobre você - 

218 
00:07:45,998 -> 00:07:48,033 
      - Ele se preocupa comigo. 
            Ele faz. 

219 
00:07:48,100 -> 00:07:50,035 
- "Porque não há ANGELINA WAY 
        Ia dizer NÃO, 

220 
00:07:50,102 -> 00:07:51,803 
     PORQUE ela bateu VOCÊ 
        Na noite anterior. 

221 
00:07:51,871 -> 00:07:53,138 
        - BANG simpatia. 

222 
00:07:53,206 -> 00:07:55,106 
        - Angelina, 
 Você está entendendo agora, garota. 

223 
00:07:55,174 -> 00:07:56,241 
    Dois dias em uma fila! 

224 
00:07:56,309 -> 00:07:58,910 
     - Hum, eu, você sabe, 
        CONSTITUÍDO esta mentira 

225 
00:07:58,978 -> 00:08:00,178 
 SOBRE MIM TENDO SEXO COM JOSÉ, 

226 
00:08:00,246 -> 00:08:01,613 
    JUST SO eu não precisava 
          Ouvir alguém 

227 
00:08:01,681 -> 00:08:03,748 
    E eu não queria ter de lidar 
Com eles, como, você sabe, 

228 
00:08:03,816 -> 00:08:05,617 
    Fugir de minhas costeletas MAIS. 

229 
00:08:05,685 -> 00:08:07,586 
  - Batendo, UH, Vinny UM DIA 
        E então - 

230 
00:08:07,653 -> 00:08:10,055 
O outro cara no dia seguinte. 
- Isso é algo que você faria. 

231 
00:08:10,122 -> 00:08:11,656 
         - Sim, certo? 
- Sabe o que eu estou dizendo? 

232 
00:08:11,724 -> 00:08:13,258 
    Aquele é um movimento MIKE. 
- Aquele é um movimento SITUAÇÃO. 

233 
00:08:13,326 -> 00:08:14,559 
    - Odeio essa coisa toda 

234 
00:08:14,627 -> 00:08:16,127 
      QUE UM INDIVÍDUO pode fazer isso, 
    Mas as meninas não pode, como ... 

235 
00:08:16,195 -> 00:08:17,829 
  - NÃO É TRISTE QUE EXISTE 
    Um duplo padrão. 

236 
00:08:17,897 -> 00:08:19,331 
     TODO MUNDO sabe que há 
    Um duplo padrão. 

237 
00:08:19,398 -> 00:08:20,899 
      Everybody Loves A GUY 
        MENINAS QUE RECEBE. 

238 
00:08:20,967 -> 00:08:22,267 
  Ele é o Homem. ELE É O cafetão.
239
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,437
AND THEN, EVERYBODY DOESN'T LIKE
      A GIRL THAT IS A HO,      

240
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,272
      AND THAT'S ANGELINA.      

241
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,307
- I'M A SINGLE GIRL, LIKE,      
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?      

242
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,142
- YEAH, IF THAT'S WHAT HELPS YOU
         SLEEP AT NIGHT.        

243
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,412
 - ANGELINA GOT IT IN WITH VINNY
  BECAUSE SHE'S A LOOSEY-GOOSE. 

244
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,483
 AND THEN SHE HAD SEX WITH JOSE 
          THE NEXT DAY.         

245
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,252
             WHORE!

- IT'S ALL GOOD. I'M NOT HATING.
            WHATEVER.           

249
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,825
    I'M YOUR ROOMMATE.          
     WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?     

250
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,226
- I KNOW IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD,

251
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,995
  BUT YOU'RE BRINGING GUYS HOME 
         LEFT AND RIGHT.

00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,399
 THAT, LIKE, LIVE IN THIS HOUSE 
  AND DON'T LIVE IN THIS HOUSE. 

254
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,401
YOU'RE GIVING THEM A REASON     
        TO HUMILIATE YOU.       

255
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,437
    - GOOD TIMES, GOOD TIMES.   
             - HMM.

00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,906
    - TOM IS COMING TO VISIT.   

257
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,707
        [laughing]              

258
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,510
        TOM SEES A NUMBER       
  THAT HE DOESN'T APPROVE OF... 

259
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,112
              TOM.              
     - [bleep] SUCKS SO BAD.    

260
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,346
     - YOU GOT TO CALM DOWN.

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,488

- YOU SHUT THE [bleep] UP!      

657
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,179
      - GET OUT OF MY FACE.     

658
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,081
             - WHOA!            

659
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:34,091
            ¶ ¶                 

660
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,707
        - YOU GUYS READY?       
          - I'M READY.          

661
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,742
            - READY?!           

662
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,544
  OH, YEAH. GYM, LAUNDRY. YEAH. 

663
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,147
    - I WAKE UP EARLY.          
      THE HOUSE IS A MESS.      

664
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,716
        IT'S DISGUSTING.        

665
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,818
I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING WITH     
A BUNCH OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW,     

666
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,119
          ZOO ANIMALS.          

667
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,054
    THIS [bleep] HOUSE.         
          ANOTHER MESS.         

668
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,823
DISHES ARE ALWAYS PILED UP.     

669
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,158
    IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT   
  WHERE IT'S LIKE OVERWHELMING. 

670
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,593
        IT'S JUST GROSS.        

671
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,463
         [phone ringing]        

672
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,498
             HELLO?             

673
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,166
     - HEY. I'M AT THE POOL.    
        WHAT'S UP?              

674
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,701
  - I'M JUST CLEANING THE HOUSE 
          A LITTLE BIT          

675
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,103
 'CAUSE IT'S A [bleep] DISASTER.

676
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,270
  YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH?  

677
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,006
             - YEAH.            
 - ALL RIGHT, SO COME HERE NOW. 

678
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,941
        - ALL RIGHT. BYE.       
             - BYE.             

679
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,617
         - LOOKING GOOD!        

680
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,952
         - WHAT A CHEST.        

681
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,388
     - IF I DIDN'T DO MY GTL    
     OR TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,    

682
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:38,956
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D LOOK LIKE.

683
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,691
IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE GYM,     
      YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.      

684
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,827
 IF YOU DON'T TAN, YOU'RE PALE. 

685
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,196
  AND IF YOU DON'T DO LAUNDRY,  
    YOU AIN'T GOT NO CLOTHES.   

686
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,498
    I WROTE DOWN "SITUATION."   

687
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,333
     IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.    
         LET'S FIND IT.         

688
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,235
- HOW DO YOU SAY "CLOTHES"      
        IN SPANISH?             

689
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,936
             <i>- ROPA.</i>            
         <i>- NO ROPA.</i>             

690
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,772
 <i>- NO ROPA PARA SITUATION.</i>      

691
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,007
 <i>- NO ROPA PARA SITUATION.</i>      
           <i>- NO BUENO!</i>          

692
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,776
     - NO, I NO SEE NOTHING.    

693
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,512
    - <i>NO BUENO.</i> I GOT--         
 REMEMBER I CAME IN, I CAME IN, 

694
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,013
    I GOT [unclear] WITH YOU.   

695
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,581
 - NO, NOT WITH ME. NOT WITH ME.
        - REMEMBER?             

696
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,285
            OHH, NO!            
    - OHH, A SITUATION!         

697
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,753
         - YOU REMEMBER         
     YOU PICK UP YESTERDAY?     

698
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,221
    - I PICKED UP YESTERDAY?    

699
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,856
         - YEAH, HONEY,         
    YOU PICKED UP YESTERDAY.    

700
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:15,192
 I WAS HERE WHEN YOU PICK IT UP.

701
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,527
      REMEMBER, SITUATION?      

702
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,229
    - OH, OK, OK. OK, OK, OK.   
              - OK?             

703
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,931
    - MY BAD. [laughs]          

704
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,044
        I CAME BACK             
     FROM MY WHOLE GTL GAME,    

705
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,247
AND ON THE FRONT DOOR I SEE     
    A NICE LITTLE NOTE.         

706
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,583
  - "SAMANTHA. WE MET AT A CLUB 
     LAST NIGHT. MY NUMBER."    

707
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,920
    - [Pauly laughing]          

708
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:44,655
     - OH, THAT'S MY CHICK.     
             - HUH?             

709
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,724
    - THAT'S MY CHICK.          
        - all: OH.              

710
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,726
 - I THOUGHT IT WAS TO SAMANTHA.
              - NO.             

711
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:49,927
  - I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR SAMMI, 

712
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,929
     LIKE SOME GUY WROTE IT     
        FOR SAMMI.              

713
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,430
        - NO, IT'S MINE.        

714
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,633
THIS IS THE SAME CHICK I HAD MET
  THE NIGHT BEFORE AT THE CLUB. 

715
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,605
- AND I HAD TO LEAVE, AND I     
 DIDN'T GET THIS CHICK'S NUMBER.

716
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,373
BUT, UH... I GUESS SHE FOUND ME.

717
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:04,608
     WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CHICK.    

718
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,410
     I WAS TALKING ABOUT HER    
    ALL DAY TODAY TOO.          

719
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,279
 THE NOTE SAYS, LIKE, "SAMANTHA"
    AND HAS HER NUMBER,         

720
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,748
     AND IT SAYS "CALL ME."     

721
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,150
        NOW, IF I WANTED        
    TO DECIPHER THAT FOR YOU,   

722
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,718
      IT PRETTY MUCH SAYS,      
    "HERE'S MY NUMBER.          

723
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,522
         PLEASE CALL ME         
SO WE CAN BANG REAL QUICK."     

724
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,132
- EVERYTHING'S GOING SMOOTH     
      FOR RONNIE AND SAMMI,     

725
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,466
      AND, UM, IT'S BORING,     

726
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,834
    SO I NEED TO CREATE         
        SOME EXCITEMENT.        

727
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,236
        [laughing]              

728
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,504
              - YO.             

729
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,954
- [laughing] JUST KIDDING!      

730
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,490
      - OH MY GOD, [bleep].     

731
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,125
     - SOMEBODY WROTE THIS.     
      IT WAS ON THE THING.      

732
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,927
     IT'S FOR MIKE, THOUGH.     
    - OH. YOU'RE AN [bleep].    

733
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,128
         - LOOK AT THIS.        

734
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,164
        [laughing]              

735
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,632
     - HER NAME'S SAMANTHA?     
             - YEAH.            

736
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,467
  - OH, GOD, YOU'RE A [bleep].  

737
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,570
          - [laughing]          
         - HOLY [bleep].        

738
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,971
            - SEE YA.           
        - HAVE FUN.             

739
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,473
- DON'T WANT TO BE NOWHERE      
            NEAR HER.           

740
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,708
ME AND PAULY DEFINITELY IS      
 A LITTLE DRAINED AT THIS POINT.

741
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:15,846
 I WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH, JUST
  WANT TO CHILL OUT AND RELAX.  

742
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,083
- WHERE'S THE TOPLESS PART?     
      I WANT TO GO TOPLESS.     

743
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,258
 - LET'S GET SOME GUYS' NUMBERS 
          ON THE BEACH          

744
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,560
  AND INVITE THEM OUT TONIGHT.  

745
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,795
          - [laughing]          
 I WANT THAT KID'S NUMBER, LOOK.

746
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,096
        - WHO, WHO?             
         - RIGHT THERE.         

747
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,132
         - BUT, EW! EW.         
          - [laughing]          

748
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,266
- OH, LOOK, THERE'S PAULY,      
             RIGHT?             

749
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,401
            - WHERE?            

750
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,535
- YOU WANT TO GO OVER THERE     
             OR NO?             

751
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,103
            - EHH...            

752
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,774
    - I BASICALLY DIDN'T SAY    
  ANYTHING TO VINNY AND PAULY.  

753
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,342
  I'M WITH MY FRIEND RIGHT NOW. 

754
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,045
I DON'T WANT TO BE DISTURBED BY,
 YOU KNOW, IMMATURE LITTLE MEN. 

755
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,947
    SO I DECIDED TO HANG OUT    
         WITH MY FRIEND         

756
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,215
        AND NOT EVEN SAY        
        ONE WORD TO THEM        

757
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,983
    AND NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE    
      THAT THEY WERE THERE.     

758
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,223
 - ME AND VINNY, WE NOTICE THESE
  BEACHED WHALES ON THE BEACH.  

759
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,991
         [whale sounds]         

760
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,393
    OH NO, I'M SORRY, IT WAS    
  ANGELINA AND HER FRIEND GINA. 

761
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,428
    WE SEE THEM AT THE BEACH.   

762
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,863
    WE'RE NOT EVEN SAYING HI    
            TO THEM.            

763
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,531
     WE'RE LETTING THEM HAVE    
          THEIR SPACE.          

764
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,665
 ME AND VINNY JUST KIND OF DO US

765
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,667
 AND LET ANGELINA AND HER FRIEND
            DO THEM.            

766
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,472
      - ME AND PAULY, LIKE,     
  CAN HAVE FUN OUT OF NOTHING,  

767
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,840
      AND WHEN WE HANG OUT,     
         IT'S JUST LIKE,        

768
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,908
      IT'S JUST NO EFFORT.      

769
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,510
    WE JUST EASILY GET ALONG    
        WITH EACH OTHER.        

770
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:21,745
HE'S LIKE A BEST FRIEND OF MINE.

771
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,213
          - [laughing]          

772
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,082
    YOU LOOK MAD FUNNY.         

773
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,150
 WE HAD A GOOD TIME, HIM AND I. 
    WE MET SOME GIRLS.          

774
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,353
  AND THEN THEY, UM, HELPED ME  
     BURY VINNY IN THE SAND.    

775
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,787
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU BOOBS.     

776
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,023
 - NO, BUT THESE ARE PRETTY BIG.
      I THINK YOU'RE A "B."     

777
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,559
     - OH, NICE BOOBS, BRO.     
     I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD.     

778
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:38,595
             - YEAH.            

779

    AND I SAW A USED PAD, UM,   

904
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,463
      YOU KNOW, ON MY BED.      

905
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,998
        IT'S ALWAYS MIKE.       

906
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,134
    HE'S ALWAYS PRANKING ME,    
 AND I'M SO [bleep] SICK OF IT. 

907
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,902
    - YO, THAT'S [bleep] UP.    
          WHO DID THAT?         

908
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,604
     I'M GOING TO THROW UP.     

909
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,573
  - I WAS A LITTLE EMBARRASSED, 
     BECAUSE I DID FEEL LIKE    

910
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,208
I DIDN'T KNOW THE NEW KID,      

911
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,410
    AND FOR HIM TO HAVE SEEN    
      SOMETHING LIKE THAT,      

912
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,644
  I THINK HE WAS PROBABLY LIKE, 

913
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,213
    "WOW. WHAT GOES ON          
         IN THIS HOUSE?"        

914
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,514
      - YO, WHO WOULD WANT      
         TO TOUCH THAT?         

915
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,982
    WHAT THE [bleep] IS WRONG   
        WITH THEM?              

916
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,717
I'LL JUST PICK IT UP AFTER,     
        YOU KNOW--              

917
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,253
 - NO, I'M THROWING IT OUT NOW. 
    IT'S MY [bleep] [bleep].    

918
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,323
 - NO, WITH A PLASTIC BAG JUST--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH IT.     

919
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,094
- WHAT A [bleep] DOUCHEBAG      
        THAT [bleep] IS.        

920
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,196
          HIS [bleep]!          

921
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,132
    HE'S SUCH A [bleep], MAN.   
        I HATE HIM.             

922
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,703
    MIKE'S A [bleep] [bleep].   

923
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,607
        - OH, YEAH!             

924
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,542
 - I SHOULD JUST GO LOCK MYSELF 
     IN THE BATHROOM, SO...     

925
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,876
     - [both girls laughing]    

926
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,646
          - DOUCHEBAG.          

927
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,387
             [beep].            

928
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,567
      [gasps] CHECK MY BED.     

929
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,335
         DID HE [bleep]         
    WITH MY BELONGINGS?         

930
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:56,273
             HE DID.            

931
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,908
    MIKE'S A [bleep] [bleep].   

932
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,212
        - OH, YEAH!             

933
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,026
 THERE'S A TAMPON UNDER THE BED.

934
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,094
      IF YOU WEREN'T DIRTY,     
    YOU WOULDN'T GET A PRANK.   

935
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,263
    - DON'T EVEN SAY NOTHING    
            ABOUT IT.           

936
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,232
        'CAUSE IF YOU DO,       
      THEN IT'S GONNA GET--     

937
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,467
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO,
              SO...             

938
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,436
     - OH NO, I DON'T CARE.     

939
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,004
        - WHAT'S UP, MAN?       
        WHAT'S YOUR NAME?       

940
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,140
        - MICHAEL.              
    - NICE TO MEET YOU.         

941
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,609
ARE YOU FRIENDS OR RELATED OR...
     - YEAH, HE'S MY FRIEND.    

942
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,511
    - WHERE DID YOU MEET HIM?   
         - ON THE BEACH.        

943
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,512
        - OH, COOL, COOL.       

944
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,016
 YOU KNOW ANGELINA BROUGHT HOME 
  ANOTHER DUDE FROM THE BEACH?  

945
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,452
- WE REALLY HAVE TO STEP UP     
        OUR PIMPING GAME.       

946
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,820
            - I-- I--           
    - BECAUSE, LIKE...          

947
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,856
YOU KNOW, I BANG TWO-- SHE BANGS
    TWO GUYS IN THE SAME DAY.   

948
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,192
SHE'S GETTING DAYTIME DATES     
          IN THE HOUSE.         

949
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,360
  LIKE, YO, WE GOT TO STEP UP,  
              BRO.              

950
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,961
     - SHE BRINGS HOME A GUY    
        EVERY OTHER DAY--       

951
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:53,997
 - SHE'S LIKE A [bleep] MATINEE 
         DURING THE DAY.        

952
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,732
 - SHE'S GOT THE MATINEE, RIGHT?
     - SHE'S A MATINEE, YO.     

953
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,602
 - ANGE, WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, 
      IF YOU COULD HELP OUT     

954
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,438
  WITH THE DISHES WITH SOME OF  
  THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE 

955
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,639
     THAT DON'T DO ANYTHING.    

956
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,107
- I CLEANED UP ALL MORNING,     
        BABY DOLL.              

957
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,275
            - REALLY?           
            - MM-HMM.           

958
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,776
    - ARE YOU FOR REAL?         

959
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,111
 'CAUSE I'M THE ONE THAT CLEANED
     THE WHOLE HOUSE TODAY.     

960
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,679
        - YOU CLEANED UP        
        EVERYTHING ELSE,        

961
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,715
 BUT I THREW AWAY GARBAGES, AND 
  I CLEANED UP A LOT OF STUFF-- 

962
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,283
        - GARBAGES?             
        - [clears throat]       

963
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,551
    - ARE YOU FOR REAL?         
        - I SWEAR TO GOD.       

964
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,952
- WOULD YOU WANT TO WALK OUTSIDE

965
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,987
AND SEE HOW MANY TRASH BAGS     
    I FILLED UP TODAY?          

966
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,322
- CAN YOU STOP STARTING WITH ME,
              MIKE?             

967
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,557
     'CAUSE I'VE [bleep] HAD    
     ENOUGH OF YOUR [bleep].    

968
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,958
- YO, OH MY GOD, ANGELINA.      
             [bleep]            

969
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,160
         YOU KNOW WHAT,         
MAYBE IF YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE     

970
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,562
A [bleep] [bleep] TAMPON--      

971
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:26,896
          - IT <i>WAS</i> YOU.         
    - IN THE [bleep]--          

972
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,465
          - IT <i>WAS</i> YOU.         
- IN THE BATHROOM ON THE FLOOR--

973
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,667
          YOU-- WHAT--          
- IT WASN'T ON THE FLOOR, IDIOT.

974
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,069
 WHAT WORLD DO YOU LIVE IN WHERE
 THERE'S A [bleep] DIRTY TAMPON?

975
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,839
    YOU ARE THE DIRTIEST GIRL   
         I'VE EVER MET.         

976
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,173
      - I THINK IT'S GROSS      

977
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,743
  THAT ANGELINA LEAVES HER PADS 
        AROUND THE HOUSE.       

978
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,877
 SO FOR MIKE TO GET MAD AT THAT,

979
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,779
    YOU KNOW, I GOT HIS BACK    
        COMPLETELY.             

980
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,581
 - DON'T TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THIS
     IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS,    

981
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,149
 'CAUSE YOU'RE MAKING EVERYBODY 
          NOT LIKE YOU.         

982
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,283
- I DON'T CARE WHO'S HERE.      

983
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,885
        THIS IS MY HOUSE.       
          I DON'T CARE.         

984
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,820
  - LEAVE ME THE [bleep] ALONE. 
    GET OUT OF MY FACE.         

985
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,890
     - YO, SHUT YOUR MOUTH,     
    YOU DIRTY LITTLE HAMSTER.   

986
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,759
- YOU LOOK LIKE POPEYE ON CRACK.
  GET OUT OF MY FACE, JERKOFF.  

987
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:56,993
  - POPEYE ON CRACK. OH MY GOD. 

988
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,529
HOW MANY GUYS DID YOU SLEEP WITH
        IN 24 HOURS? TWO.       

989
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,030
     - NO, I DIDN'T HAVE SEX    
      WITH JOSE, YOU MORON.     

990
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,365
        - VINNY AND JOSE.       

991
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,967
    - CAN YOU TELL-- TELL HIM   
      TO GO [bleep] HIMSELF     

992
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,101
     AS MY FRIEND RIGHT NOW.

00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,536
        - 24-HOUR PERIOD,       
      YOU BANGED TWO GUYS.      

994
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,405
        - YO! MIKE, STOP.       
 - YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOOD AT?

995
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,973
YOU'RE GOOD AT BEING A HO.      

996
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,908
  - OH, WELL, YOU'RE A DIRTBAG, 
 AND YOUR PENIS SHOULD FALL OFF,

997
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,277
    'CAUSE YOU'RE DISGUSTING.   
    'CAUSE YOU'RE DISGUSTING.   

998
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:15,879
    - YEAH, ALL RIGHT.          
     - DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.     

999
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,614
HE'S [bleep] 'CAUSE YOU'RE      
    IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW.   

1000
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,016
    - HE'S TRYING TO MAKE ME    
            LOOK BAD.           

1001
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,485
  I DO WHAT I WANT IN MY LIFE.  

1002
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,120
  THAT'S IT. I'M A SINGLE GIRL. 
        I DO WHAT I WANT.       

1003
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,791
 I'M GLAD THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
        TO BE MY FRIEND,        

1004
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,759
 AND YOU'RE TRYING TO EMBARRASS 
 ME IN FRONT OF MY REAL FRIENDS.

1005
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,461
  - I'M NOT TRYING TO EMBARRASS 
    YOU IN FRONT OF ANYBODY.    

1006
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,562
          - ALL RIGHT,          
  JUST SHUT THE [bleep] UP NOW! 

1007
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,696

1008
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,299
      - GET OUT OF MY FACE.     

1009
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,401
             - STOP!            
 - WHOA, WHOA! COME ON, COME ON!

1010
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,602
      - GET OUT OF MY FACE,     
          YOU JERKOFF!          

1011
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,073
     - HEY, BABY, WHAT'S UP?    
        COME ON IN.

        GUESS WHAT?             

1013
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,110
I'M ABOUT TO SMASH TONIGHT.     

1014
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,111
             - OH!!             

1015
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,579
    - YO, WHAT IS THAT?         

1016
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,181
      IS THAT HER SCREAMING     
        HAVING SEX?             

1017
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,682
- THAT'S THE SOUND OF LOVE.     

1018
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,950
    - AND <i>I'M</i> A WHORE.          

1019
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,885
             - ALEX!            
     YOU HOOKED UP WITH HER?    

1020
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,153
         - NO, I DIDN'T.        

1021
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,655
     - YOU DEFINITELY, LIKE,    
    HOOKED UP WITH HER.         

1022
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,256
     SNOOKI HAS THE AUDACITY    
    TO WALK IN THE DOOR         

1023
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,158
     HOLDING MY GUY'S HAND.     

1024
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,061
