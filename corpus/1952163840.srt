1
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,608
- At Cape Canaveral,
another probe into space.

2
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,478
Target: the Moon.

3
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,244
A 52-ton multistage rocket

4
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,719
combining elements of
the Thor ICBM and the Vanguard

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,381
is ready for firing.

6
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,392
On the planned course,
the 83-pound Pioneer space probe

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,086
would closely approach
the Moon

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,028
and would be swung into orbit
by the Moon's own gravity.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,133
- Two...

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,393
One...

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,196
Zero.

12
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,496
- The vehicle roars aloft
at too steep an angle,

13
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,075
working more directly
against gravity than planned,

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,077
reaching over
23,000 miles an hour.

15
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,807
It carries
to nearly 80,000 miles,

16
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,110
30 times as far as ever before.

17
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,276
The Pioneer remains

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,753
man's most resoundingly
successful probe into space.

19
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,318
At last, the truth
about flying saucers.

20
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,430
They're real.

21
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,657
Just as real as Santa Claus,
that's what,

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,167
and we've got 10,000 Allentown
youngsters to back us up.

23
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:14,569
They greeted old St. Nick as he
made his first 1957 appearance.

24
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,267
Santa greets his greeters
with gifts and a gala party,

25
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,037
as is his custom.

26
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,839
A flying saucer carries

27
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,347
lots more Christmas cargo
than reindeer.

28
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,576
Where are the reindeer?

29
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,050
Why, they're back
at the North Pole, honey.

30
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,155
But don't you cry.

31
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,517
Santa is still Santa.

32
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,124
Christmas is still Christmas.

33
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,785
And kids are still kids.

34
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,831
Right up to the minute both
in transportation and in dress,

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,597
the first ski birds
of the season migrate

36
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,265
to the Bear Mountain Inn,
hopeful of snow.

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,537
There is no snow in New York,
but that's no never mind,

38
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,614
because the emphasis right now
is on fashions.

39
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,079
They're all dressed up for snow

40
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,084
in their White Stag ensembles
for winter sportswear,

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,122
colorful outfits that will
light up any festive occasion.

42
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,723
Hollywood, California.

43
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,352
Two titans of the movie industry
go head-to-head,

44
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,964
and no one wins.

45
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,589
World-famous movie star,
M. Eric McCormack,

46
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,225
known affectionately by his fans
as "Meric,"

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,770
has reached an impasse
in a contract dispute

48
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,374
with his long-time boss,
Louis Q. Goldstone,

49
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,477
head of Goldstone
International Pictures.

50
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,478
With production complete
on <i>Allen Trespass,</i>

51
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,879
rumored to be the greatest
science fiction movie ever made,

52
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,214
it appears a legal showdown
will deprive the world

53
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,685
of ever seeing it.

54
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,016
Louis Q. made the announcement

55
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,988
at his Hollywood studio
this week.

56
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,457
- It saddens me deeply
to announce

57
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,461
that Goldstone International
is shelving the release

58
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,158
of its epic sci-fi picture
<i>Allen Trespass</i>.

59
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,859
I'm ordering today
that all prints

60
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,994
and the negative of the film
be destroyed.

61
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,129
- Mr. Goldstone!
Mr. Goldstone!

62
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,508
- Meric, seen here in a recent
interview with Edwin R. Burrows

63
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,909
days before he and Goldstone
parted ways,

64
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,414
has described the movie
as his best acting work ever.

65
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,518
- Tell me about the movie.

66
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,950
- I'll tell you a little,

67
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,715
because Goldy would have
my you know what.

68
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,088
- And that's the news
from around the world.

69
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,618
- Earlier today,
I met with Dr. Ted Lewis.

70
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,250
He's the director of the
Bald Mountain Observatory.

71
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,590
- And one big gumdrop.

72
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,891
- Welcome, Dr. Lewis.

73
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,796
Tonight is the height
of the meteor showers.

74
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,564
The Perseid meteor showers,
is that right?

75
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,763
- Right.

76
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,706
- Doctor, would you please tell
our audience exactly

77
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,007
what are meteors,
and where do they come from?

78
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,082
- Well, they could be the debris
from comet tails,

79
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,548
like the Perseids,

80
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,778
or simply the rocks and dust
of worlds

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,080
that were destroyed long ago.

82
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,951
- Destroyed worlds?

83
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,524
You-you mean like our Earth?

84
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,457
- Well...

85
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,586
yes.

86
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,630
But don't worry; that's not
likely to happen to us

87
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,733
any time soon.

88
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,301
- Well, that certainly
is good news, Doctor.

89
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,927
What happens when meteorites-

90
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,571
- Stardust.

91
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,476
- Oh, Ted, darling, another one.

92
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,775
You really must see this.

93
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,645
It's breathtaking.

94
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,752
- In a minute, dear.

95
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,047
It doesn't peak till
2:00 in the morning anyway.

96
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,122
- Oh, Ted, another.

97
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,592
Nutmeg?

98
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,489
- I'm the chef
around here tonight, remember?

99
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,721
- Of course you are, darling.

100
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,057
Happy anniversary.

101
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,792
- Happy anniversary, Lana.

102
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,238
Coals ready?

103
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,704
- Look good.

104
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,744
Oh, Ted,
look at the big bright one.

105
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,484
- Dick.

106
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,390
Dick, you promised.

107
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,396
- Penny, please,
just be reasonable.

108
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,103
Now, look, we-we couldn't
possibly love each other

109
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,503
any more on our honeymoon,
could we?

110
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,801
Right?

111
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,138
- Nice try, Mr. Perkins.

112
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,711
Dick, look, a shooting star.

113
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,876
Quick, make a wish.

114
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:32,149
So what was your wish?

115
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,258
- Well.

116
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,830
- What is it with you guys?

117
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,022
- Whoa, Penny, what is that?

118
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,592
It's shaking around
like it's crazy.

119
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,260
- Oh, gosh.

120
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,270
That's 'cause it's coming
straight at us.

121
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,601
- Oh!

122
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,572
- Dick, it's gonna hit us.
- Oh, boy.

123
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,109
- Hurry, Dick,
it's getting closer.

124
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,405
- Come on, you piece of junk!

125
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,211
Oh, God!

126
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,749
- What on earth was that?

127
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,724
Ted?

128
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,527
- Darn, I'm trying
to reach the observatory,

129
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,633
but there's no dial tone.

130
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,394
The crash must have knocked out
the lines.

131
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,560
- What was it, an asteroid?

132
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,762
- No, dear, more like
an immense meteoroid.

133
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,771
And right in our own backyard.

134
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm going up there.

135
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,234
- Whoa.

136
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,607
- Lana, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

137
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,737
- It's molten iron, right?

138
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,815
Won't it be a little
too hot up there,

139
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,851
like 2,700 degrees?

140
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,215
Why don't you let it cool down
until morning.

141
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,326
I'll keep you plenty warm
until then.

142
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,488
- Since when did you become
an expert on meteoroids?

143
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,598
- I learned something

144
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,166
in those silly classes of yours,
remember?

145
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,360
- Silly, huh?

146
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,607
Now, get out there
and check on those steaks, hmm?

147
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,745
- Oh, no, Ted.

148
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,021
- Merlin.

149
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,557
Hey, wake up,
you old bag of bones.

150
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,558
Do you see that?

151
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,788
That's a spaceship, old boy.

152
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,697
A real, live,
honest-to-goodness spaceship

153
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,293
from outer space, it is.

154
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,031
I knew it.

155
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,734
I knew they'd finally show up.

156
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:34,335
Yeah, I told them, the fools.

157
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,448
I knew they were gonna come.

158
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,676
I knew it.

159
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,786
Come here, boy.

160
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,718
Come here.
Come on.

161
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,121
Yeah, we got a spaceship
to get, huh?

162
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,189
Come on, come on.

163
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,821
Yeah, we're gonna be famous,
you and me.

164
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,304
- There it is.

165
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,169
There it is, old boy.

166
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,838
Okay, Merlin.

167
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,573
Now, how does this sound?

168
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,481
Greetings, space brothers
from a distant star.

169
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,019
Welcome to our planet.

170
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,106
- Ted?

171
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,401
- Out here, dear.

172
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,941
- Time for your present.

173
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,101
- Oh, I got it, dear.

174
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,405
The binoculars are wonderful.

175
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,980
- Your other present, darling.

176
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,583
- Oh, my.

177
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,214
- No, no, no, pinhead.

178
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,384
PPP is Proper Police Procedure.

179
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,860
PPD is an unknown DOA.

180
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,225
- Well, I thought
that was a PPK.

181
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,562
- No, PPK is what you do behind
a tree after you see a stiff.

182
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,566
How'd you pass the exam,
anyway,

183
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,898
promise to fix the teacher's
parking tickets?

184
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,974
- Hey, easy on him, Vern,
the kid's okay.

185
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,098
Ain't that right, Bubba?

186
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,210
- Huh?

187
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,470
- Thank you, come again.

188
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,136
- Sorry, Darlene.

189
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,148
- Number five,
number two, dry and deadly.

190
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,251
Is that you, Tammy?

191
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,352
- I'm sorry, Sam.

192
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,010
- All right, so what is it
this time, huh?

193
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,121
Flat tire?

194
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,483
Sick aunt?
Men from Mars?

195
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:45,647
What?

196
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,520
This has got to stop, toots.
- I'm sorry, Sam.

197
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,788
- Four, five, and six
are all yours, honey pie.

198
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,693
I'm out of here, Simone.

199
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,964
Bye, boys.

200
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,607
- Hey, Tammy, why don't
you and I go on up to the point?

201
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,836
- Not a chance, Vernon.

202
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,674
- Why not, sweetheart?

203
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,544
- Because you're Vernon,
Officer Vernon.

204
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,058
- Hey, Tammy, you've been here,
what, three years?

205
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,626
All that time,
I've never seen you with a guy.

206
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,750
- What's your point?

207
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:24,863
- Nothin'.

208
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,727
- I said, what's your point,
Vernon?

209
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,740
- What is the point, Lloyd?

210
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,312
- Well, you know.

211
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,414
- What?

212
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,742
- Drop it, Bubba.

213
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,248
- Right, Vern.

214
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,617
- Cats, did you see that thing?

215
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,483
Wow, it blasted
right into the butte.

216
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,590
It was crazy.
- See it?

217
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,749
It almost hit us
up at the point,

218
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,951
passed right over our heads.

219
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,061
It was unreal.

220
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,060
- Dick, if my father finds out
we went to the point,

221
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,164
he'll go ape.

222
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,232
- Don't sweat it, queenie,
my lips are zipped.

223
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,062
So what do you think it was,
Dickie?

224
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,169
- Well, we couldn't tell.

225
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,931
It was-it was huge
and all covered with flames.

226
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,369
- Hey, Vern's in there.

227
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,997
Maybe the egg sucker
knows something.

228
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,110
Let's go see.
- Yeah.

229
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,802
- Thank you very much.

230
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,277
- You're welcome.

231
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,080
- I'm gonna call in, Vern.

232
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,686
- Hey, Vern, did you hear about
that big crash up on the butte?

233
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,229
- It's Officer Watson to you,
cockroach.

234
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,332
- You're the police.

235
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,626
You're supposed to protect us.

236
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,534
What if it's
a secret commie rocket?

237
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,196
- Shouldn't you punks
be in school?

238
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,012
- Vern, I just called in.

239
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,810
Something crashed
into the butte last night,

240
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,248
and the chief wants us
to check it out.

241
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,352
- Anybody hurt?

242
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,044
- That's what we're supposed
to find out.

243
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,179
- Come on, let's go.

244
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,588
- Whatever you say, Chief.

245
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,390
You rodents stay out of trouble.

246
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,660
- Man, what a jerk that guy is.

247
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,768
- Cool it, Dickie.

248
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,665
It's his job to suck eggs.

249
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,533
So, cats, what are we
gonna do about it?

250
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,639
- Do about what?

251
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,070
- The crash, the crash.

252
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,175
We got to get up there.

253
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,367
- Sorry, Code, can't.

254
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,410
Freddy's Ford just got
one of them new Edsels in.

255
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,038
- Richard, this is
the biggest thing ever

256
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,243
to hit this nowhere zilch town,
and you can't?

257
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,149
- But it-it's only gonna be
there from 10:00-

258
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,085
- Dickie,
Edsels will be around forever.

259
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,315
This won't.

260
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,824
Come on, man, just up there
and back, real quick.

261
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,929
I mean, what could
possibly happen?

262
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,495
- Well, if you want to go
that bad to look that pitiful,

263
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,602
then okay.

264
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,796
- Penny, you are the queen.

265
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,925
- See anything?

266
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,560
- Nothing but rocks.

267
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,511
- Anything?

268
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,977
- More rocks close up.

269
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,652
- A plane crash
might still be burning, right?

270
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,520
- Yeah, probably.

271
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,890
- So would one of them rockets.

272
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,860
- You got me.

273
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,431
- Maybe it is a rocket, Vern,

274
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,761
from that test range
over in Nevada.

275
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,393
They're putting atomic bombs
on top of rockets now.

276
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,335
Wouldn't want to get near
one of those things.

277
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,565
All that radiation.

278
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,572
No, sir.
- Radiation?

279
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,676
- Yeah, I read about it.

280
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,335
It's a nasty way to go.

281
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,446
First you get real sick,

282
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,514
start puking up your guts,
and then blood.

283
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,617
Then you get hives
all over your body.

284
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,013
It's gross.

285
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,119
Little boils.

286
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,584
- That's enough, Barnes.

287
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:10,779
- Well, that's not all, Vern.

288
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,322
You know, your hair starts
to fall out.

289
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,449
You start bleeding
out of your nose and mouth.

290
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,787
Your skin gets all cracked and-

291
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,759
- Barnes.

292
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,962
- Then you die, Vern.

293
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,298
- Man, oh, man.

294
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,409
- Uh-oh.

295
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,511
- Back up behind those trees.

296
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,580
- Okay.

297
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,113
Cody, they're gonna see us.

298
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,588
- No, they won't.

299
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,062
- Let's just go home.

300
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,686
- Penny.

301
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,458
- You chickens go
if you want to.

302
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,295
- I'm going up there.

303
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,800
- Come on, Dickie.

304
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,337
This could be very, very cool.

305
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,964
- Uh, we'll just
wait for you here.

306
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,575
All right, Clyde.

307
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,182
- Dick, I'm scared.

308
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,948
- What's wrong, Penny?

309
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,615
- I don't know what it is.

310
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,319
- Come here, baby.

311
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,488
Penny, there's really nothing
to be scared of.

312
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,600
Look, we're all alone.

313
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,270
- No, we're not.

314
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,972
- Whoa, hold it right there,
Officer Barnes.

315
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,307
- Vern?

316
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,574
- You see that glow?

317
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,378
That's a meteor for sure.

318
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,486
Got that?

319
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,485
That's how meteors glow.

320
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,852
There's no crash;
there's no bodies.

321
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,822
Case closed.
Let's get the heck out of here.

322
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,552
- Uh, Vern, don't you
want to check it out?

323
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,662
- No, I do not.
Let's go.

324
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,196
That's an order.

325
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,068
- Dick.

326
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,871
I saw something in the trees
over there.

327
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,739
- What?
I don't see anything.

328
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,370
- Dick, let's just go.

329
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,709
- Penny, Cody's still out there.

330
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,510
- Dick, let's go.
Now.

331
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,346
- Penny, you're just imagining-

332
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,324
- What is it?

333
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,430
- I don't know, Penny.

334
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,588
I don't know.

335
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,291
- Oh, no.

336
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,233
Not again.

337
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,565
Penny, quick,
roll up your window

338
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,673
and lock your door.

339
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,946
Dick, it's on the roof!

340
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,862
- Oh, God!

341
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,363
- It's so horrible.

342
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,023
- Okay, I think it's gone.

343
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,134
- Yeah?

344
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,066
- Let's just get out of here.

345
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,569
Penny! Penny!

346
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,032
- What are you doing here,
cockroach?

347
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,938
- It's a free country,
Officer Watson.

348
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,601
- You little nosebleed.

349
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:22,871
- Officer! Cody!

350
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,176
- Yeah, kids?

351
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,750
- A monster.

352
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,011
We were attacked by a monster.

353
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,120
- A monster?

354
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,915
- Yeah, we were in my car
up in the trees.

355
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,082
And it had a big eyeball,
and it tried to kill us with a-

356
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,888
- A thing, like,
a big tentacle thing.

357
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,690
- Yeah, it was real, I swear.

358
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,195
- A monster, Dickie?

359
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,630
- Officer Watson,
you have to believe us.

360
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,929
- You know what I believe?

361
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,538
I believe your punk pranks
have gone too far this time.

362
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,640
- What?

363
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,469
- Last summer,
it was the killer with the hook.

364
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,576
The year before that-

365
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,871
- Officer, please.

366
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,479
Please.

367
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,013
- It's time
you learned your lesson.

368
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,309
Get in the car.
- Officer.

369
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,418
- Get in the car.

370
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,076
- Hey, watch it.

371
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,211
- You too, young lady.

372
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,756
- Not so fast, Watson.

373
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,521
I know my rights.

374
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,959
Oh, I'm-I'll get in.

375
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,689
I'm in. I'm in.

376
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:21,003
- I'll haul these punks in;
you drive their car.

377
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,106
- Okay, Vern.

378
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,468
- Thanks a lot, Code.

379
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,667
Just there and back, right?

380
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,476
- Really hate that guy.

381
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,335
- Ted, is that you?

382
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,438
- No.

383
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,268
- Not a note, nothing?

384
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,773
Look at you.

385
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,104
- You are Lana.

386
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,212
- And you are a mess.

387
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,507
- You are Ted's mate.

388
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,741
- Of course I am.

389
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,875
- Ted loves Lana.

390
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,613
- And Lana loves Ted.

391
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,883
- Hormonal polarity.

392
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,723
Yes, I have heard of
this phenomenon.

393
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,990
Odd sensation.

394
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,831
Call it what you will, dear.

395
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,962
Last night was wonderful.

396
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,165
Now, go clean up, get dressed,
and come to breakfast.

397
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,275
- You are Lana.

398
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,377
You must assist me.

399
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,775
- Really, Ted,
you can dress yourself.

400
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,711
Men.

401
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,650
And if you must go off
chasing your meteors

402
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,349
in the middle of the night,
next time you tell me.

403
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,459
I was worried half to death.

404
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:03,105
Ted, what is this?

405
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,674
Pocket-sized binoculars?

406
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,777
- No.

407
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,745
- Oh, Ted,
I know how to be careful.

408
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,473
Oh, you scientists.

409
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,651
Go sit down.

410
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,412
Breakfast is ready.

411
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,429
Ted I'm going to tell you
something Mother said.

412
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,060
She said,
"It can happen in a marriage.

413
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,264
"One morning you just wake up,

414
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,841
and there's a stranger sitting
across from you."

415
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,638
I told her
it was utter nonsense.

416
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:45,939
Now I'm not so sure.

417
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,188
Oh, Ted, are you all right?

418
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,485
- What is this?

419
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,991
- Oh, no.

420
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,094
Oh, dear.

421
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,196
Ted, you stay right there.

422
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,763
I'm gonna call Dr. Miller.

423
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,637
Darn it, the line is still out.

424
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,505
Ted, you must go lie down.

425
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,609
- What is this called?

426
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,301
- Salt.
It's called salt.

427
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,412
- Salt.

428
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,138
This will harm the Ghota.

429
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,543
You are Lana.
You must assist me.

430
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,115
- Oh, Ted, stop it.
You're scaring me.

431
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,651
- Ted wants you safe.

432
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,819
- How was breakfast, Chief?

433
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,049
- Oh, same old slop.

434
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,159
Anything up?

435
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,421
- Old man Wilson called again,
screaming about his space man.

436
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,530
- Was he drunk?

437
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,722
- Of course.

438
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,026
And the typewriter
needs a new ribbon.

439
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,032
- Paperwork, Stiles,
get used to it.

440
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,136
Better you than me.

441
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:41,034
In two days, I'm retired.

442
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,335
Case closed,
as Officer Watson likes to say.

443
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,671
- Ha.

444
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,440
Vern brought in some kids.

445
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,209
- Uh-huh.

446
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,841
Making a false report
to the police,

447
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:59,923
that's a very serious charge,
Mr. Perkins.

448
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,322
- We were attacked,
Chief Dawson.

449
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,722
We got attacked by a monster.

450
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,659
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,958
That's what it says right here,
all right,

452
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,066
"attacked by a monster."

453
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,296
- It looked like a big eyeball
with a long tentacle thing.

454
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,167
- Right.
- It tried to kill us.

455
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,774
You have to believe me.

456
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,307
I've never been so scared.

457
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,910
- I'm going to notify
your parents.

458
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,535
- No, please don't.

459
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,705
- Just give us a break,
will you?

460
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,884
- If I ever see any of you
in my office again,

461
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,317
you'll all need lawyers.

462
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,889
You dig me, Mr. O'Hara?
- Mm-hmm.

463
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,288
- Get out of here
before I change my mind.

464
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,395
- Ah.

465
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,298
Yeah, okay, Merlin.

466
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,701
Yeah, okay, you old hound.

467
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,238
Come on.
Come on.

468
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,446
Away you go.
Away you go.

469
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,745
Don't be gone long,
you old goat.

470
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,224
Sorry about last night,
space brothers.

471
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,623
Just a little bird shot.

472
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,697
No harm done, right?

473
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,460
I'll take you
to our leader today.

474
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,000
I promise.

475
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,104
I will.

476
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,653
- Ted, darling,
what are you doing?

477
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,223
- Salt.

478
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,325
- It's-it's under there.

479
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,086
You know that.

480
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,460
Why don't you go lie down?

481
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,569
- Salt will protect Lana.

482
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:52,670
You will assist me.

483
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:53,828
- Of course I'll assist you.

484
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,098
I'll take care of you.
- Good.

485
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,207
We must go.

486
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,433
You will drive.

487
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,803
- Yes, of course I'll drive.

488
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,070
Um, we'll go see Dr. Miller.

489
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,440
It's Saturday, but-

490
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,013
- No doctor;
the Ghota.

491
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,173
- The Ghota?

492
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,908
What Ghota?

493
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,383
You need to see Dr. Miller.

494
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,249
- I must find the Ghota
before it divides.

495
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:11,616
- You need to see the doctor.

496
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:12,950
- Ted wants you safe.

497
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,490
- Stop saying that.

498
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,593
I am safe.

499
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,751
Ted is not safe.

500
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,590
- No.

501
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,856
Ted is safe.

502
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,829
- I'm going to get Dr. Miller.

503
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,263
- You will not assist me?

504
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,805
Lana.

505
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,141
Lana.

506
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,481
Lana?

507
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,494
- Oh, hey, toots, do me a favor.

508
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,430
Run out to the Gunderson farm
and pick me up three dozen eggs.

509
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,901
You got time to get out there
and back before the lunch crowd.

510
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,096
- Sure, Sam.

511
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,325
- Dr. Lewis.

512
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,436
Hello?

513
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:40,845
- You are Tammy.

514
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,173
- Gosh, Dr. Lewis,

515
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,178
I didn't think
you remembered me.

516
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,680
- Ted remembers you.

517
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,409
- Um, uh, where are you going?

518
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,917
- That way.

519
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,021
- To the butte?

520
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,680
Can I give you a lift?

521
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,758
I'm headed that way myself.

522
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,019
- You were going that way.

523
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,823
- Oh.

524
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,090
Well, a girl can change
her mind, can't she?

525
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,494
- Yes.

526
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,068
Minds can be changed.

527
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,965
- Is something wrong?

528
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,131
Oh, gosh.

529
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,572
Gosh, I'm sorry.

530
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,006
I know you're married.

531
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,168
- Yes.

532
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,677
Lana is Ted's wife.

533
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,645
- Please, I don't mean
anything by it.

534
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:21,274
I was just trying to be...

535
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,386
helpful.

536
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,487
- You will assist me?

537
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,316
- I'd be happy to, Dr. Lewis.

538
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,083
- Good.

539
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,554
- Ah, well, all right then.

540
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,465
Um, Dr. Lewis, can l-

541
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,570
can I call you Ted?

542
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,535
- My name is Urp.

543
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,833
- Do you want some Rolaids?

544
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,032
I've got some in my purse.

545
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,769
Dr. Lewis.

546
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:47,878
Can l-Ted.

547
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,344
Can I ask you
a personal question?

548
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,675
- Yes.

549
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,250
- At night, when you're
looking through a telescope,

550
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,250
do you ever wonder
what's out there?

551
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,947
I mean, what's really out there.

552
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,354
- I know
what is really out there.

553
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,789
- I suppose you do.

554
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,191
But I'm talking about
other worlds

555
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,595
and civilizations and things.

556
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,394
It gives me shivers
just to think about it.

557
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,494
- I get shivers
on Toolamane Four.

558
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,606
- What's that?

559
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,298
- It is one of seven ice planets

560
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,205
that orbit
the neutron star Tryxl.

561
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,606
- Ice planets?

562
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,373
You can see other planets, wow.

563
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,880
I never knew
you astronomers could do that.

564
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,279
- I have been to many planets.

565
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,283
My home planet is Koddhar.

566
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,512
It is in the Draco cluster.

567
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,057
- Right.

568
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,090
What is that thing?

569
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,100
- It is a biogenic
phase disruptor.

570
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,328
- A what?

571
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,632
Is that, like, some kind of gun
or something?

572
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:49,740
- Yes.

573
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:52,274
- I hope you don't hunt with it.

574
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,173
You don't hunt with it, do you?

575
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,677
- Yes.

576
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,544
- Well, my gosh, I never thought
you'd be the type, Dr. Lewis.

577
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,742
The stores are full of meat.

578
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:03,115
You don't have to go around
killing defenseless animals.

579
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,245
- The Ghota is not defenseless.

580
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,085
- Goats.
You're hunting goats.

581
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,192
- Ghota, not goats.

582
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:10,385
- Ghota, goats,
whatever you say, I don't care.

583
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,517
It's cruel.

584
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,257
- It is necessary.

585
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,959
In several of your hours,
the Ghota will divide.

586
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,762
If it is not stopped
before that,

587
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,030
it will feed
and then multiply exponentially

588
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,766
until Ghotas consume all life
on this planet.

589
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:24,932
- And you're here to stop it.

590
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,668
- Yes.

591
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,871
I would be called
a federal marshal in your world.

592
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,641
I enforce security
in this quadrant.

593
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,719
- Deals, deals, deals!

594
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,088
Come on down today
to Freddy's Ford!

595
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,320
Freddy's Ford, where we-

596
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,988
- Friends, do you have
tired blood?

597
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,292
- Hey, Lloyd, leave it on.

598
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,401
- What for?

599
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,502
It's all trash.

600
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,603
- I want to hear it.

601
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,227
I think maybe I got tired blood.

602
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,839
- No, you've got lazy blood,
Bubba.

603
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:56,941
There's a difference.

604
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:00,169
- If you have
that rundown feeling-

605
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,176
- Hey, Lloyd, I think maybe

606
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,281
I got that rundown feeling
all the-

607
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,382
Ow.

608
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,279
- If you so much
as touch that radio again,

609
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:08,976
I'm gonna throw you
in front of the truck,

610
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,213
and you're gonna have
a run-over feeling, you hear me?

611
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,654
- Lloyd.
- "Lloyd."

612
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,229
- Damn, Lloyd.

613
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,331
What was that thing?

614
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,432
- I don't know.

615
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,864
I-I don't know.

616
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,697
- Where'd it go?

617
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,940
- Sure was ugly.

618
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,245
- What was that?

619
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,353
- I-I don't know.

620
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,684
- Let's get back to town.

621
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,028
- Well, my truck broke down

622
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,228
right here
in beautiful bustling Mojave,

623
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,601
and I've been stuck here
ever since.

624
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,105
I finally got
a little money saved,

625
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,676
and someday,
I'll move to Sausalito.

626
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,971
It's a very hip town,
you know.

627
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,511
There are a lot of artists
out there.

628
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,208
And maybe I'll open
an art gallery.

629
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,218
Gee, I sure can blabber on.

630
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,618
You haven't heard a word
I've said, have you?

631
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,054
- Yes, I have.

632
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,752
Your last sentence was,
"Gee, I sure can blabber on."

633
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,464
Yeah.

634
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,429
It's all
wishful thinking anyway,

635
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,761
some pipe dream.

636
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,926
- No.

637
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,594
You will move to Sausalito.

638
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,830
You will make art.

639
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,133
You will open an art gallery.

640
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,742
- Really?

641
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,901
Now, how do you know all this,
pray tell?

642
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,180
- Because I do.

643
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,081
- Whoa.

644
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,984
Let's change the subject, okay?

645
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,681
Tell me more about your Ghotas.

646
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,055
Do they have three eyes
and six horns?

647
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,329
No.

648
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,056
They are unicellular amphipods

649
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,224
with a nucleolytic
subdermal membrane

650
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,665
and capable of complete
chromodynamic distortion.

651
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:06,770
- What does all that mean?

652
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,134
- Ghotas can
make themselves invisible.

653
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,501
- Invisible.
Cool.

654
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,903
- Ghotas are not cool.

655
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:16,503
Their metabolic temperature
is 155 of your degrees.

656
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:20,879
Ghotas are an aggressive,
intelligent, and clever species.

657
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,509
This one disabled the plasma
injectors on my spacecraft.

658
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,281
I was forced to land
on your planet.

659
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,481
The Ghota escaped.

660
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,149
- So Ghotas can, uh, think?

661
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,761
- Yes.

662
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,757
Stop.

663
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,890
Stop here.

664
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,570
- What?

665
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:40,671
Did you see something?

666
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,241
- No, I sensed it,
over there by that dwelling.

667
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,342
We get out here.

668
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,443
- We?

669
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,669
- You must come with me.

670
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,801
Ted wants you safe.

671
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,244
- That's sweet of Ted.

672
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,077
I want Tammy safe too.

673
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,754
- Come.

674
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,059
Stay behind me,
close.

675
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,977
- Um, Dr. Lewis, I really don't
think we should be here.

676
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,014
- Stop.
Don't move.

677
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,377
This is not good.

678
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,114
- What is not good?

679
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,223
It's only a puddle.

680
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,984
Somebody spilled something,
that's all.

681
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:37,686
- Yes, a puddle.

682
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,625
- So why is a puddle not good?

683
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,254
- The Ghota has eaten.

684
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,991
It absorbs its prey's nutrients,

685
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,125
leaving only water
and metabolic residue.

686
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,702
- What?

687
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,099
- Humans are mostly water.

688
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,501
- Humans?

689
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,607
That's a person?

690
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,708
- It was a person.

691
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,809
- Oh, look at it.

692
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:53,911
That is a mud puddle.

693
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,411
It's not a person.

694
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,980
Dr. Lewis, Ted,

695
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,548
aren't you carrying
this Ghota thing

696
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:00,878
a little bit too far?

697
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,144
I mean, you're very creative,

698
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,049
and I think it's great
that you're rounding up

699
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,348
all the bad killer space goats.

700
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,456
- Quiet.
Stay behind me.

701
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,024
- Oh, this is absurd.
What for?

702
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,524
- Ted wants you safe.

703
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,218
- Oh, would you please
not talk like that?

704
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,195
It is beginning to bug me.

705
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,768
I think I've had enough
of this silly, stupid game.

706
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,869
- You are safe with me.

707
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,698
- You keep away.

708
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,927
- Pull over.

709
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,162
I got to take a whiz.

710
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,432
- Can't you wait
until we get to town?

711
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:57,541
- No, I can't.

712
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,200
Now, please pull over there
by those trees.

713
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:04,246
- Oh, you're like a child,
Bubba.

714
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,025
Now, what was that?

715
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,594
Don't go too far, Bubba.

716
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,720
You're too drunk
to find your way back.

717
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,389
- Don't worry about it, Lloyd.

718
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,558
I can handle it, I think.

719
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:31,975
- Bubba?

720
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,808
Are you getting sick, Bubba?

721
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,151
What's this mess you left here?

722
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:56,500
Bubba?

723
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,110
- Boom! Zap!

724
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,338
- Tommy, cut that out.

725
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,142
- Zap! You're dead, you creep.

726
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,614
- Oh, Mrs. Lewis.

727
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,979
- Hi, is Dr. Miller in?

728
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,916
- No, he's-
- Laura we've got to go.

729
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,021
We'll be late.

730
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,383
- How many times
have I told you?

731
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,115
We're not going to the movie.

732
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,123
- Well, when will he be back?
- It's not fair.

733
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,728
- Well, that's the price
of being a creep.

734
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,660
He's seen enough
of that science fiction junk.

735
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:28,765
It gives him nightmares.

736
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,161
- Laura, really, it's important.

737
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,268
When will Dr. Miller be back?

738
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,562
- Oh, it won't be until late.

739
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,034
He's gone off to Barstow.

740
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:36,605
- Barstow?

741
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:37,708
Will you tell him-

742
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,434
- Laura, you really bite.

743
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,544
- What?

744
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,667
Kid, you're hamburger.

745
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,111
- A monster is a pretty hard
thing to swallow, Dickie.

746
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,982
- You know, fine, Cody,
don't believe me.

747
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,914
- When the heck
you gonna grow up, Code?

748
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,425
- The monster did it, Dickie.

749
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,890
Dig this, cats.

750
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,159
Suppose your monster is real.

751
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,962
- It is real.
- Okay, okay.

752
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,536
So it's real.

753
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,469
My old man just got one of them
new Polaroid cameras,

754
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,405
you know, like,
instant pictures.

755
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,601
We go up there,

756
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,644
snap off a few shots
of your monster,

757
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,044
sell 'em to the newspapers,
and get rich, rich, rich.

758
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,149
- It almost killed us.

759
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,648
- So this time
we'll be ready for it.

760
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,980
- With what,
a paranoid camera?

761
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,556
- It's a Polaroid, man,
Polaroid.

762
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,282
So what's it gonna be, Dickie?

763
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,018
This is our big chance.

764
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,458
Don't blow it, Clyde.

765
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,856
- I think it's the only way
we can prove what happened.

766
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,735
- I don't believe this.

767
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,384
- There's nothing here now.

768
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,150
Looks like your monster split.

769
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,953
- Good.
Let's go home.

770
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:07,530
- Hey, I bet the crash
and the monster are connected.

771
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,632
Yeah.

772
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,597
Come on, let's go up there.
- No, let's go home.

773
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:11,701
- You're nuts, Cody.

774
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,860
That's way too far to climb.

775
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,971
- Too far?
Please, Dickie.

776
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,766
- Cody, if Dawson ever finds out
about this-

777
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:17,874
- Don't sweat it, pal.

778
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,101
We'll be fine.

779
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,856
Wow.

780
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,653
- What is it,
a rocket?

781
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,761
- Yeah.

782
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:38,862
No.
Maybe.

783
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,557
I don't know.

784
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,999
But I do know
we're gonna be rich, Dickie.

785
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,194
Oh, yeah.
Come on, let's go.

786
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,067
- Cody, wait.

787
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,468
It could be radioactive.

788
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,597
- Oh, you think?

789
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,710
- You got your picture.

790
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,869
Let's just split
while we still can, okay?

791
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,948
- Yeah, right.

792
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,449
- Come on.

793
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,656
- You're being a brat.

794
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,021
- I said I don't want
to go home.

795
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,152
- Tommy, we're going home,
and that's it.

796
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,460
- No, I want to go
back to the town.

797
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,431
No.

798
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,767
Please.

799
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,980
You stink.

800
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,309
- Just keep it up, brat,

801
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,246
and you won't be able
to sit for a week.

802
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,683
- My dad is going to fire you.

803
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,618
- Oh, this time, Tommy,
you are cooked.

804
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,724
Now, go to your room.

805
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:41,825
- No.

806
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,122
- You are really cruisin'
for a bruisin', kiddo.

807
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,167
Laura!

808
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,370
- What is it now, Tommy?

809
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:38,344
- Laura!

810
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,144
- What are you doing
out of your room?

811
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,912
Do you want me to check
for monsters again?

812
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,418
- It's up there.
- You little creep.

813
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,954
You see all
those horrible movies,

814
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,455
and now you're
scared of monsters.

815
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,785
- The monster is up in the hall.

816
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,917
Laura, it's true.

817
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,598
- It's true.
I saw it on TV last week.

818
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,997
The guy even had pictures.

819
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,004
- I still say it's a secret jet
the air force have.

820
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,437
- Chief, jets don't fly
like that.

821
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,702
Jerking around
and then suddenly zipping away?

822
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,334
- I'll jerk some sense
into both of you.

823
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,776
What we saw out there
on the butte,

824
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,881
that was a meteor,
common garden-variety meteor.

825
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:12,983
Case closed.

826
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,313
- Mojave police, Chief Dawson.

827
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,220
- Uh-huh.

828
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,154
All right, we'll ask
around our neighborhood.

829
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,385
Call me if you learn anything.

830
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:25,893
Strange.

831
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,997
- Chief?

832
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,621
- That was Stiles.

833
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,894
He found Lloyd Olson's truck
abandoned.

834
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,560
No sign of him or Bubba.

835
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,672
Said the doors were both open,

836
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,274
and the key
was still in the ignition.

837
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,240
Only thing around
was a couple of big puddles.

838
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,140
That's odd.
It hasn't rained in months.

839
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,545
Mojave police, Chief Dawson.

840
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,347
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

841
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,455
Who is this?

842
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,649
Uh-huh, Laura McBride.

843
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,227
What can I do for you,
Miss McBride?

844
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,989
A monster?

845
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,563
With a giant eyeball.

846
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,065
Look, we're kind of busy here,
Miss McBride.

847
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,429
All right.

848
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,729
Doc Miller's house.

849
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,531
All right,
we'll-we'll send someone out.

850
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:11,106
Yes, yes, yes, of course,
right away.

851
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,373
Laura McBride is having
an emergency,

852
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,606
a giant monster, she said.

853
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,150
- Laura is Susie McBride's
kid sister, isn't she?

854
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,844
- Mm-hmm.

855
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,421
- That's-

856
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,218
That's one classy chassis.

857
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,758
- Watson, you're going out
on a call, not a date.

858
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,794
Take Stu.

859
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,897
- I don't need a chaperone.

860
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,589
- For backup.

861
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,132
I don't like
what's going on today.

862
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,208
- Hello.

863
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,471
I'm Officer Vernon Watson.

864
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,604
What seems to be the problem?

865
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,239
- There's a monster
in the house.

866
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,850
- Really?
A big one?

867
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:55,952
- I don't know what it is.

868
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,144
I've never been so scared.

869
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,915
- Hey, aren't you
Susie McBride's kid sister?

870
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,524
- What?

871
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,717
There's something horrible
inside there.

872
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,123
Do something.

873
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,320
- How's Susie doing?

874
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,091
She still hanging out
with that insurance jerk?

875
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,392
There's a big old hairy monster!

876
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,593
Oh!

877
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,221
- Vern, you okay?

878
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,912
- Vernon?

879
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,429
Vernon?

880
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,259
Vernon, this better not
be a joke.

881
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,707
Vernon?

882
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,344
Vernon.

883
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,488
- Hey.

884
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,756
Hey, you!

885
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,297
Is that you, Dr. Lewis?

886
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,960
What are you doing?

887
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,768
Hey!

888
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,306
Hey!

889
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,342
Hey!

890
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,351
- Oh, he just walked in.

891
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,009
I'll tell him.

892
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,019
- Good news only, Stiles.

893
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:20,350
- Sorry, Chief.

894
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:21,787
Ted Lewis stole a car.

895
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,017
This is the license.

896
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,457
- Dr. Lewis
from the observatory?

897
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:25,856
- Very one.

898
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,486
- Lewis, huh?

899
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,189
See, you never know.

900
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,358
These eggheads, they seem
like they're one step away

901
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,765
from the rubber room anyway.

902
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,270
Bring him in.
- 10-4, Chief.

903
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:40,570
- Unit two, unit two.

904
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:41,678
- Go ahead, unit two.

905
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,870
- Chief, we have a PDX.

906
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,981
We have a PDX here.

907
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,946
- A PDX, Officer Barnes?

908
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,051
Get it right.

909
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,278
- A PDX.
Vern's down.

910
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,387
- He's down?

911
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,989
- Yeah, he was there,
and then there was nothing,

912
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:55,318
just-just a puddle.

913
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:57,894
- Puddle?

914
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,086
- Yeah, with his gun
and badge in it.

915
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,424
What should I do now, Chief?

916
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:05,993
Chief?

917
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,923
- Chief?

918
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,601
- Sorry about Vernon, Chief.

919
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:40,964
He was a first-rate officer.

920
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,196
- Yeah.

921
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,671
- Chief, what could have
done this?

922
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,105
Folks are saying
it must be acid,

923
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,268
a psycho killer with acid.

924
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,379
What else could it be?

925
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,347
- Mojave police.
Dawson here.

926
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,214
Are you sure?

927
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,412
All right, all right.

928
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,750
Call me if you
see anything else.

929
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,317
That was Ed Sanders.

930
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,087
He spotted Lewis
on his property,

931
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,458
said the boob drove
all over a stop sign.

932
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,691
Oh, Sanders thinks Lewis
has some kind of weapon.

933
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,028
- You think it fires acid?

934
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,366
- Really, Barnes.

935
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,564
Knew I should have never
taken this job.

936
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,674
- What?

937
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,209
- Town needed a temporary chief
for three weeks

938
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:24,074
until they found a real cop.

939
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,114
I thought being
a dogface in the war

940
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,773
was enough qualification for me.

941
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:28,885
"Don't worry," they said.

942
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,749
"Nothing ever happens here,"
they said.

943
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:35,756
And for five years, nothing did.

944
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:40,192
And then two days before my
replacement finally takes over,

945
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,323
and suddenly we have monsters
and killers

946
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,959
and men from Mars
and God knows what else!

947
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:55,135
Just two lousy, stinkin' days.

948
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,082
- Where you going, Chief?

949
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,518
- Guess it's time to play cop.

950
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,530
- I'll stay here.

951
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,196
- Mommy!

952
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:19,131
Mommy!

953
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,965
- Betsy, what is it now?

954
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:23,732
- Mommy, there's bears out here.

955
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,841
They're trying to eat me.

956
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,808
- Remember what happened to
the little boy who cried wolf?

957
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:28,911
- But it wasn't a wolf.

958
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,569
It was a bear.

959
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,428
- What'll it be, guys?

960
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,120
- Coke.
- Coke.

961
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,322
- I'll have an RC Cola.

962
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:49,955
- Very funny, Cody.

963
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,534
Okay, three Cokes.

964
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,637
Well, you're sure
full of yourself today, mister.

965
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,136
- You betcha.

966
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,831
We're gonna be rich, Tammy.

967
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,569
We got a picture
of a genuine spaceship.

968
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:02,678
- A spaceship?

969
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,679
- Yeah, that crashed up
on the butte last night.

970
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,646
Got a picture of it right here.

971
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:08,978
Whoa, be careful with that.

972
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,245
It's worth a million bucks.

973
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:11,581
Not as good as a monster, but-

974
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,416
- A monster?

975
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,524
- A monster, Tammy.

976
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,388
We were attacked
by a monster this morning,

977
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,585
only no one will believe us.

978
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,925
- Wh-what did this monster
look like?

979
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:24,431
- Well, it was-it was
like a big, shimmering,

980
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,593
shiny balloon thing
with a big eyeball.

981
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:27,703
- Yeah, it was weird.

982
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,236
It was there one minute
and then gone

983
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,169
like it could just
become invisible.

984
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:32,332
- Oh, my God.

985
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,842
- Tammy, do you believe us?

986
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,776
- Cheese it.
It's the cops.

987
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:47,920
- Tammy, coffee.

988
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,151
- Chief Dawson, there's
something I have to tell you.

989
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:51,260
- Later, Tammy.

990
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,361
- Chief, please.

991
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,985
- Not now, Tammy.

992
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,030
- Tammy, more coffee.

993
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,896
- Hey, Dawson, whatever happened
to Vern Watson?

994
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,798
I heard he got melted by acid.

995
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,700
- Yeah, and I hear
Lloyd and Bubba are missing.

996
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,898
And what's this talk
about a monster?

997
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,372
- A monster, Fred?

998
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,737
Get real.

999
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,970
It's a schizophrenic,
manic-depressive psychotic.

1000
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,705
I read all about these sickos.

1001
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,510
I didn't know you <i>could</i> read.

1002
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,948
Look, people.

1003
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,078
Listen to me,
there are no psycho killers,

1004
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,951
no monsters.

1005
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,321
All we got is a couple
of unsolved disappearances,

1006
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,449
that's all.

1007
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,959
- That's all?

1008
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,154
Phew!

1009
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,788
Well, that-that's a relief.

1010
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,391
- Look, just-
just stick together.

1011
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,503
Stay in your homes.

1012
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,503
You see anything unusual,
you report it.

1013
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,336
And trust me,
there's no cause for alarm.

1014
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,172
- Well, it sounds like there's
plenty cause for alarm, Dawson.

1015
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,404
- People, please.

1016
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,214
- Darlene, number five,
number two, hot and sweaty.

1017
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:50,886
Great speech, Dawson.

1018
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:51,988
I feel so much better now.

1019
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,555
- Give 'em to Tammy, Simone.

1020
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,782
My shift's over.

1021
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,186
- Tammy, get your buns
over here.

1022
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,692
- Chief, please listen to me.

1023
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,989
I know this will sound crazy,
but you have to listen to me.

1024
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,928
- Well, crazy's the word
for the day.

1025
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,465
All right, go ahead, Tammy.

1026
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,661
- Chief, the killer is some kind
of alien creature.

1027
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,396
It's called a Ghota.

1028
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,597
It came from the spaceship,

1029
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,934
you know, that crash
on the butte.

1030
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,372
Chief Dawson, please,

1031
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,478
this is
a very dangerous creature.

1032
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,909
It can think.
It can hunt.

1033
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,014
It's a born killer.

1034
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,513
- Mm-hmm.

1035
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:22,482
- All it leaves behind
is a puddle...

1036
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,984
the victim's water.

1037
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,519
- How'd you know about that?

1038
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,622
- I've seen it.

1039
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,882
- You've seen this thing?

1040
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:30,083
- Well, no, no, not exactly.

1041
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,215
Dr. Lewis told me about it.

1042
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,693
- Well, Lewis has gone bananas.

1043
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,525
- Actually, Dr. Lewis
is a marshal,

1044
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,566
a federal marshal
from another...

1045
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,964
planet.

1046
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,738
- Another planet.

1047
00:55:43,873 --> 00:55:44,840
Ah, dang!

1048
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,738
- Chief.
Chief?

1049
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:48,844
- You're nuts.

1050
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:49,945
Lewis is nuts!

1051
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,572
This whole town,
you're all stark raving loco!

1052
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,023
- I want to know
what's going on.

1053
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,804
Oh!

1054
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,202
- Sorry.

1055
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,308
Sorry.

1056
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,807
- Let's go, Henry.

1057
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,845
We're safer outside
with the acid killer.

1058
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,814
- Oh, no, Sam.

1059
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:30,920
Where's the bag?

1060
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,078
- It's busted.

1061
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,349
There's a new one on order.
- Great.

1062
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,015
- Hey, toots, would you
run up the street

1063
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,421
and pick me up some lard,
please?

1064
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,527
The cheap stuff.

1065
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:39,855
I'll mind the store.

1066
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,930
- Great.

1067
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,462
Merlin.

1068
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:48,764
Come here, boy.

1069
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,600
Come here.

1070
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,901
Where's Wilson?

1071
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,236
Merlin, what's-what's wrong?

1072
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,838
Merlin, it's all right.

1073
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,340
- Cody.

1074
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,816
Code, you hear about Vern?

1075
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,443
- Yeah, I heard.

1076
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,921
- Jeez, Code,
your archenemy's missing.

1077
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,026
We figured you'd be kicking
your heels up with joy.

1078
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,220
- He sucked his last egg, right?

1079
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,523
- Yeah, I guess.

1080
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,029
- Hey, why don't we go
to the flicks?

1081
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,326
Yeah, it's just what you need.

1082
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,627
- No, you cats go ahead.

1083
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,463
- Ah, come on, Code,
my treat.

1084
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1085
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,005
- Okay, why not?

1086
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:28,201
- Come on.

1087
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,470
- Mommy!

1088
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,637
Mommy!

1089
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,981
- What is it now, Betsy?

1090
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,643
- There's a monster
with one big eye.

1091
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,551
- I told you before
to stop making up stories.

1092
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,714
Now, see what you've done?

1093
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,382
You've gone
and scared yourself silly.

1094
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,188
- There's a monster.

1095
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,264
- There are no monsters.

1096
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,230
You get inside now.

1097
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,334
- Mommy.

1098
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,373
- What's with you, Tammy?

1099
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,635
You've been like that all day.

1100
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,300
Just-just keep your mind
on your work.

1101
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:36,605
- Sorry, Sam.

1102
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,838
- Come on.

1103
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,711
This killer thing's
getting to you, huh, toots?

1104
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,551
Well, I think we can forget
about any dinner crowd

1105
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,314
in here tonight.

1106
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,788
All right, I'm going.

1107
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,120
Sweep up the sidewalk

1108
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,560
and straighten up in here
before you leave, will you?

1109
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,080
- Stop right there, Dr. Lewis.

1110
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,551
- You are Stiles.

1111
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:19,655
You are a constable.

1112
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:20,756
You must assist me.

1113
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,348
- Yeah, sure, that's exactly
why I'm here, Dr. Lewis.

1114
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,328
Is that a weapon, sir?

1115
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,191
- Yes.

1116
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:32,062
- All right, Dr. Lewis, just-
just hand me the gun, sir.

1117
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,498
- Why?

1118
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,035
- Because I'm asking you to.

1119
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,469
I don't want any-
I don't want any trouble here.

1120
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,268
Just hand it over nice and slow.

1121
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,740
- No.

1122
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:44,737
- Now, look here, Dr. Lewis.

1123
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,145
- Officer Stiles.

1124
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,250
Dr. Lewis.

1125
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,351
What's going on?

1126
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,452
- Get back inside, Tammy.

1127
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,578
- Tammy, the Ghota is near.

1128
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,155
I must find it
before it divides.

1129
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,257
- Ghota?

1130
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,358
- The monster.

1131
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:57,459
We'll be overrun.

1132
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,561
We'll all be killed.

1133
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,287
- Monster?
What are you talking about?

1134
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,091
- Tell him.

1135
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,324
- Your planet will
soon be infected with Ghotas.

1136
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,435
They will consume
all organic matter

1137
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,867
until your world
is devoid of life.

1138
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,030
Before it divides,
its hunger is massive.

1139
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,142
It will seek the greatest
concentration of prey.

1140
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,504
You are all in extreme peril.

1141
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,611
- This is crazy.

1142
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:16,837
This is crazy, Dr. Lewis.

1143
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,038
Give me the weapon right now.

1144
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,978
- No, Stiles, please,
you have to believe him.

1145
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,743
- Now, look here, Dr. Lewis.

1146
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,283
I've been on this force
for 15 years,

1147
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,319
and I've never used
this gun yet.

1148
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,717
Don't let this be
the first time.

1149
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,323
Hand me the weapon.

1150
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,425
- No.

1151
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,526
- Dr. Lewis, please.

1152
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,150
- I must find the Ghota.

1153
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:40,235
- Dr. Lewis.

1154
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,362
Dr. Lewis, are you hurt bad?

1155
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,599
- I am not Dr. Lewis.

1156
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,709
I am Urp.

1157
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:50,335
I am merely indwelling
in Dr. Lewis' body.

1158
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,504
But this body is damaged.

1159
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,843
I must return to my ship
to repair it.

1160
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,575
- I'll take you.

1161
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,811
- No, I must go alone.

1162
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,184
Be careful, Tammy.

1163
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,814
Urp wants you safe.

1164
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,226
There's that polarity again.

1165
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,230
Fascinating.

1166
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,105
- That's called
obstruction of justice, Tammy.

1167
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,840
You're in a tub
of trouble, girl.

1168
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,542
Wait for me inside the diner.

1169
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:33,781
Unit three.

1170
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,686
Chief.

1171
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,259
Chief, are you there?

1172
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,520
Ted Lewis has gone insane.

1173
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,254
He's-he's armed and dangerous.

1174
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,364
He escaped.

1175
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,566
What the-

1176
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,867
What-what's going on?

1177
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,456
- Some blast of a day,
huh, baby?

1178
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,227
Monster attack,
people getting slimed,

1179
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,562
spaceship.

1180
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,364
- Dick, please.

1181
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,995
- Sorry.

1182
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,898
<i>The Blob</i>.

1183
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,408
Jeez, that's all we need
right now,

1184
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,774
to see a monster movie.

1185
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,016
- Come on.

1186
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,711
Come on.

1187
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,599
- Hello?

1188
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,871
Anybody there?

1189
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:33,733
Salt.

1190
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,275
Yes.

1191
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,436
Salt.

1192
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,202
- Mojave police.
Dawson here.

1193
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,238
- Chief, it's Lana Lewis.

1194
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,806
Please, you have to help me.
It's Ted.

1195
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:07,341
There's something terribly wrong
with him.

1196
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,307
- Yes, I know, Mrs. Lewis.

1197
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:13,176
He's-he's stolen a vehicle
and eluded arrest.

1198
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,681
I got my men
out looking for him.

1199
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:18,344
- Listen, I think-I think he
has a head injury or something.

1200
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:20,148
Please, tell your officers
not to hurt him.

1201
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,189
- Yes, ma'am,
we'll try not to.

1202
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:23,849
- You'll try?

1203
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,290
I'm coming down there
right away.

1204
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,521
- Mrs. Lewis, I don't think
that's a very good-

1205
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,426
Hello?

1206
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,365
News just keeps getting better.

1207
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:37,995
Lana Lewis is on her way here.

1208
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,199
- Have you found Lewis yet?

1209
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:45,280
- Stiles hasn't, but I expect
he'll call in soon.

1210
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:50,283
I guess I better
look for Lewis myself.

1211
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,216
Mrs. Lewis thinks he got hit
on the head.

1212
01:04:52,355 --> 01:04:55,119
I say he just flipped out.

1213
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,555
Well, be nice to her, Barnes.

1214
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:57,659
She's a little rattled.

1215
01:04:57,793 --> 01:04:59,420
- Yes, sir.

1216
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,790
- Good man.

1217
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,316
- Don't even think about it.

1218
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,474
- I won't.

1219
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:30,683
- Dick, I hate these movies.

1220
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:31,952
Let's go.

1221
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,493
- Let's see how they get
the monster.

1222
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:36,029
Just another second?

1223
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,132
- Watch this.

1224
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:39,461
I'll bet they flip out
and run like sheep.

1225
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:45,969
- Dick, that's the longest
second in history.

1226
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,666
Let's go, please?
- Just another second.

1227
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,188
- Dick, I'm feeling like I felt
in the car this morning.

1228
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,258
- Hmm?

1229
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:07,521
- When the monster attacked.

1230
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:11,463
- Where would a Ghota go?

1231
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,797
Seeking the greatest
concentration of prey.

1232
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,508
- Dave.

1233
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,837
David, the theater.

1234
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,710
- They're here!
They're here!

1235
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,875
The killers from space,
they're here!

1236
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,219
- Do you see it?

1237
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,555
Coast looks clear.

1238
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,789
Let's just get out of here.

1239
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:23,699
- Okay.

1240
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,067
It's gone.

1241
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,141
- Dick, where is it?

1242
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,947
- Come on.

1243
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,049
Go this way.

1244
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,252
Oh!

1245
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,450
- It's a monster, Dickie.

1246
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,220
- Yeah, we know that, you jerk.

1247
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,163
- Oh, no.

1248
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:56,271
Is anyone in there?

1249
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,599
- Tammy?

1250
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,707
Tammy, is that you?

1251
01:07:58,841 --> 01:07:59,808
- Penny?

1252
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,034
- Tammy, the monster's in here.

1253
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,474
It can disappear.
It can be anywhere.

1254
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:05,011
- Yeah, we've met.

1255
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:07,012
- Tammy!

1256
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,844
It's-it's hunting us.

1257
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,009
We keep trying to get out,
but it's blocking our path.

1258
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,586
- Kids, stay cool.

1259
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:13,688
I'll be right there.

1260
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:27,302
Tammy!

1261
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,063
- Tammy, hurry up.

1262
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,264
- Stay cool, kids.

1263
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,202
- Dick, I'm scared.

1264
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,578
- Where was it last time
you saw it?

1265
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:41,683
- There.

1266
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,718
- Oh, there it is.

1267
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,153
- Oh, no!

1268
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,224
- Oh, no.

1269
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,917
- Come on, kids, let's split.

1270
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,990
- Oh, no!

1271
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,728
Oh, no.
It's divided.

1272
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:03,835
- Tammy, what do we do?

1273
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:04,940
- Penny!

1274
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,541
Penny, stay back.
Stay back.

1275
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,801
Oh, no.

1276
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,129
- Tammy is safe.

1277
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,233
- Thank you.

1278
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,063
- Wow, man, you killed it.

1279
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,170
- Stop.
Don't touch it.

1280
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,271
It's not dead.
- What?

1281
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:37,372
It's not dead?

1282
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,666
- No, they're merely in stasis.

1283
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,742
We must take them back
to my ship before they revive.

1284
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,174
Get those curtains
from the door.

1285
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,438
We'll wrap the Ghotas in them.

1286
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,810
- I'll get my truck.

1287
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:49,581
- That was close.

1288
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,348
- Ted?

1289
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,455
Ted!

1290
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,556
- We must go.

1291
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,782
- Don't you think I'd better-

1292
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:56,892
- Now.
- Dr. Lewis.

1293
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:57,993
Hold it right there.

1294
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,322
- Ted!

1295
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:01,793
- Hold it right there, sir.

1296
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:02,898
- Ted!

1297
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,330
Wait!
- Dr. Lewis.

1298
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,434
- Oh!

1299
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,764
- In the name of the law,
do not move that truck.

1300
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,065
- Ted! Ted!

1301
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,417
- Barnes, what's going on?

1302
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,518
- It's Lewis, Chief.

1303
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,619
He's kidnapped Tammy.

1304
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:26,186
- That's not true.
He's just-

1305
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,981
- If you know something, kid,
you better tell me fast.

1306
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:30,091
Now, where'd they go?

1307
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,193
- To the drive-in.

1308
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,385
- Don't mess with me, O'Hara.

1309
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:33,495
Where'd they go?

1310
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:34,857
- They went to the butte.

1311
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,430
To the meteor crash,
I know it.

1312
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,999
That's where this all
got started.

1313
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,897
- All right, Barnes,
you radio Stiles.

1314
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,560
- I think Stiles is dead, Chief.

1315
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,639
A puddle just like Vern.

1316
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,105
They found his car parked
near the diner.

1317
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,768
- Good Lord.

1318
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,040
All right, you, you,
and you, Frank,

1319
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,150
you're all deputized.

1320
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,410
Get your rifles,
and you follow me.

1321
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:57,849
- Yes, Chief.
- Dawson!

1322
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:58,954
It's Ted.

1323
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,487
Don't you dare hurt him;
you hear me?

1324
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,557
- Mrs. Lewis, this is
official police business.

1325
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,159
Now, get in the car!

1326
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:06,955
- No.

1327
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,563
- Just do it.

1328
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:18,434
- Well, come on, cats,
let's go.

1329
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,174
- Jeez.

1330
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:27,304
Slow down, will you?

1331
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,218
- This is not good.

1332
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,287
- Oh, please, no more not good.

1333
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:38,752
- He's driving like a maniac.

1334
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,794
- Oh, Dawson.

1335
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:41,987
- We'll catch him, all right.

1336
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,258
Barnes, is your revolver loaded?
- Dawson!

1337
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,276
- There!

1338
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,570
Turn here through that tunnel.

1339
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:56,678
- But my ship is ahead.

1340
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,779
- Turn here.

1341
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:01,314
This is a shortcut to the butte.

1342
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,258
- Be calm.

1343
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,860
It is still in stasis.

1344
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,607
Move your vehicle away.

1345
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,713
They'll be here soon.

1346
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,911
- Urp.

1347
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,023
Urp!

1348
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:45,183
- Barnes, watch this side.

1349
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:46,294
- They're here.

1350
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,965
No!

1351
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,067
- Tammy, get back.

1352
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,498
- I will not.

1353
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,897
What are you gonna do,
shoot him?

1354
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,004
And for what?

1355
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:57,537
- For murdering
half a dozen people.

1356
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:58,640
- He didn't do it, Chief.

1357
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,207
The Ghota did.

1358
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,572
His name is Urp.

1359
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,406
- No, it's not.

1360
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:06,275
That's my husband, Ted.

1361
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:07,382
He's not well.

1362
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:08,540
- No, it's Urp.

1363
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,811
He's borrowed Ted's body.

1364
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,443
He captured the Ghota.

1365
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:13,555
He saved us.

1366
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:14,656
He saved the whole Earth.

1367
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:17,281
All he wants is a few hours
to repair his ship

1368
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,415
and leave in peace.

1369
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,822
- Tammy, I'll shoot
if I have to.

1370
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:20,929
Now, get out of the way.

1371
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,052
This is police business.

1372
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,064
- It is our business,
Dawson, ours,

1373
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,100
all of us,
humans.

1374
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:32,302
This traveler from another world
spared us

1375
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,239
from an unspeakable catastrophe.

1376
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:38,608
We don't just live on a planet.

1377
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:42,342
We live in a universe,
a big universe,

1378
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:46,818
and it's filled with ice planets
and spaceships

1379
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:51,119
and-and worlds
with other beings like Urp.

1380
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,788
It's a place of unimaginable
beauty and wonder.

1381
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:58,900
And it's there
for us to explore.

1382
01:13:59,034 --> 01:14:00,194
So what are we gonna do,

1383
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,064
stay cooped up
in our little towns

1384
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,432
and our little lives

1385
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,370
and end up as small, frightened
puddles of our own making?

1386
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,705
Please, don't make this
any worse, Chief Dawson.

1387
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,939
Let him repair his ship
and leave.

1388
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,422
- All right, Marshal Urp.

1389
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,586
I'll let you off this time
with a warning.

1390
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:31,927
Fix your spaceship and...

1391
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,262
keep your goats off our planet;
you got that?

1392
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,766
- We apologize
for this trespass.

1393
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:41,068
We had feared landing on Earth

1394
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,700
because
our intelligence indicated

1395
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:46,042
that you were a pathetically
primitive life-form.

1396
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,809
But I have seen
that you are more than this.

1397
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,681
You possess determination,
resourcefulness,

1398
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,381
and uncommon courage.

1399
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,322
You will need these qualities
to survive the dangers

1400
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,485
that await and challenge
an awakening world.

1401
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:04,998
This spaceship will depart
at sunrise.

1402
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,658
Be advised to stand clear.

1403
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:09,864
- Urp.

1404
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:17,773
- Urp thanks you
for your assistance.

1405
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,881
- Will l-

1406
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:21,107
Will I ever see you again?

1407
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,808
- That is unknowable.

1408
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,746
- I'll miss you.

1409
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,016
- Urp will miss Tammy.

1410
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:38,399
Tammy?

1411
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,662
Urp would seek
this polarity with you

1412
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:42,792
if Urp was a human.

1413
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:53,739
But I still
do not understand it.

1414
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:57,847
Good-bye, Tammy.

1415
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,079
I have a long journey to make.

1416
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,656
- So do I.

1417
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,956
Good-bye, Urp.

1418
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,091
- Ted?

1419
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,928
- I am not Ted.

1420
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,593
Ted will be returned
momentarily.

1421
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,644
- Ted?

1422
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:34,055
- Lana?

1423
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:35,156
Where are we?

1424
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,348
- Oh.
Oh, Ted.

1425
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,027
Thank goodness.

1426
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:12,360
- I had a pipe.

1427
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,953
- You okay, Dr. Lewis?

1428
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:46,492
- Yes, I think so.

1429
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,687
- Good.

1430
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,890
Good, just try not to steal
any more cars, okay?

1431
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,129
- What happened?

1432
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,794
All I remember
was that I was here,

1433
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,133
and now I'm here.

1434
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,265
What on Earth am I wearing?

1435
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,140
- I'll tell you all about it,
darling...

1436
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,042
later.

1437
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,550
- Hey, Code,
why the long face?

1438
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,914
- Can you dig this, cats?

1439
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:13,385
I didn't even bring the camera.

1440
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,784
No one will ever believe it.

1441
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,288
- What's it matter, Code?

1442
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,689
We're alive, and we've had
the adventure of a lifetime.
