2
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ahhh!

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,700
<i>So... where do you want to to begin?</i>

4
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,500
Where things always begin.

5
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,100
In bed.

6
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,800
<i>You never know when you wake up</i>

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,700
<i>that this is the day your life 
is going to change.</i>

8
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,400
<i>It started out just like any other day.</i>

10
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Hello?

11
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Certainly, sir.

12
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,770
<i>And here is where the train started 
to go...a little off track.</i>

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,850
I have had the unfortunate task

14
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,200
of eliminating several key staff.

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,300
<i>Since you are one of
last people hired</i>

16
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,300
I have no choice but
to start with <i>you.</i>

17
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,600
Now I know this is unexpected 

18
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,900
but you are a very 
capable young woman

19
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>and I am certain that you will be able 
to find something right away.</i>

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,500
So, if you wouldn't mind, I would 
like you to empty out your desk

21
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,200
and vacate the premises immediately.
A security guard will show you out.

22
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,100
You're home early!

24
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,500
Finally, I get to meet Tom's sister!

25
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh God, I've been waiting for so long
to meet you. I'm Teena,

26
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,600
with a double "e".

27
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,500
<i>I don't need your department sticking 
it's nose where it doesn't belong, all right?</i>

28
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,900
<i>But how this witness--</i>

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>You have the right to a presence of an attorney.
If you desire not to afford an attorney,</i>

39.5
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,900
<i>one will get appointed to you 
before any questioning--</i>

30
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,200
<i>...shot already, call it what you want, 
but I'm telling you, that's the way it looks.</i>

31
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
<i>The phone didn't ring.</i>

32
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
<i>I got the house, the furniture...
his unpaid bills.</i>

33
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,100
<i>But Tom got all our friends.</i>

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,800
<i>So I did what any lonely girl with 
no job and no man would do.</i>

35
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,600
Oh, that was mine.

36
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
That isn't gonna fit you.
Trust me.

37
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
I- I- I put this aside.

38
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,800
My girlfriend is a size two.
Are you? A two?

39
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah, I didn't think so.

40
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,200
<i>And here's when the train 
got completely derailed.</i>

41
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,400
<i>You simply cannot go around 
beating up men, Ms. Case.</i>

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
<i>The state of Texas doesn't like it.</i>

43
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
<i>But, Judge, he stole my blouse!</i>

44
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
- <i>Were you wearing it at the time?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

45
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,000
<i>I'm sentencing you to 12 months 
of outpatient treatment</i>

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,100
<i>at the Center For Rage Management,</i>

47
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>once a week, for an hour.</i>

48
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,450
<i>If you sucessfully complete the program,
your record will be expunged.</i>

48.5
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,000
<i>But--</i>

49
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,300
<i>Or...52 hours in jail.
Your choice.</i>

50
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,000
<i>And that's how I 
ended up there... with them.</i>

51
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm Stella. 
And I use my car as a weapon.

51.5
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,500
Ahhhh!

52
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,700
He lived.

53
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,700
<i>She only hit her husband. 
They were going through a bad divorce.</i>

54
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Hi, I'm Nikki.

55
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
And I- I don't use my words.

56
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,400
<i>It wasn't her fault. The guy would
never take his clothes out of the dryer.</i>

57
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm Marsha. 
And I... treat my help badly.

58
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,100
<i>Once upon a time,
she'd been a Miss Tennessee.</i>

59
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,000
<i>But her ex husband had just left her 
for her younger version of herself.</i>

60
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
<i>She took it out on her maid.</i>

61
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,500
Kim. Assault and battery 
with a salad fork.

62
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,800
<i>Looking back, it's not so
hard to believe that</i>

63
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,900
<i>you put a bunch of angry, violent 
women in the same room</i>

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,900
<i>something bad might happen.</i>

65
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,800
<i>Well, can I send you my resume? 
And then if anything opens up, you can call me.</i>

66
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Well, could I- 
could I give you my name?

67
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,500
Take that!

67.5
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Ha!

68
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,600
<i>Well that's a very unique thing to share.</i>

69
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm sure you'd made
your mother very happy

70
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
- and she must be very relieved.
- Thank you.

71
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Alex, you've been awfully quiet. Is there anything 
you'd like to share with the group?

72
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
No, I'm fine.

73
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,400
- Doesn't look like it.
- Yeah, I- I'm fine.

74
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,600
I mean, after all that I did for him,
I- I paid the bills

75
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,800
and I supported his song writing career.

76
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Putz.

77
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
Why are they always named Tina?

78
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,100
With a double "e".

79
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, do you mean her name
or her bra size?

80
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,300
You know, Alex, every relationship
requires two participants.

81
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,500
So you were definitely in this for a reason. 
Any thoughts on this, ladies?

82
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,100
- The classic fixer.
- Classic.

83
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,000
W- What does that mean?

84
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Well, it means, uh, that you
like to fix people 

85
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
and then it makes you feel needed.

86
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,500
I mean, it's not your fault, you know.
It's a sickness.

87
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,300
When Tom didn't need you any more, 
it made you angry.

88
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,300
And you took it out on
the guy in the store.

89
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,700
Which is also totally 
fine with me, I mean...

90
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,500
he sounded like an asshole.

91
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,200
All that trouble over a synthetic blend.

92
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,700
It was a very nice shirt.

93
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Oh, well, I think we did really 
great, great work today.

94
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,200
I'll see you next week.
Bye-bye now.

95
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,800
Hi! 
Alex!

96
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,500
Hey! Come join us.
Come on in.

97
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,400
This is the little Muhammad Ali.

98
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,400
- Welcome.
- You're way behind us. Ya gotta catch up.

98.5
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,600
They only want an hour.

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,900
- Alex, you have to show us.
- Okay.

100
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,300
I was, like, "Don't push me around!
Shut up, jerk! Oh yeah?"

101
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm taking this, okay?

102
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,500
- Thanks.
- Oh my God!

103
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,700
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

104
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Two beers.

105
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,300
Did I just imagine that?

106
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Silent Revolution now.

107
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,000
<i>Silent Revolution.</i>

108
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,000
<i>That's the thing about loneliness.
It makes you overlook the obvious.</i>

109
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,400
<i>And honestly, I liked these women.</i>

110
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,300
<i>They were a little nuts, but
are interested in</i> me

111
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,600
<i>and what I had to say.</i>

112
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,300
<i>So what happened next
didn't seem that strange.</i>

113
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,600
<i>I gotta go home. 
I got work tomorrow. No, I do.</i>

114
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,700
I don't have to get up. 
Accountant seeks work, film at 11.

115
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
Really?

116
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,300
<i>And then she offered me a job.</i>

117
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,100
<i>She owned an extermination business</i>

118
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,300
<i>and gotten herself in trouble with
the I.R.S. over some back taxes.</i>

119
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
- Hey!
- Hey, how's it going?

119.5
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,800 
<i>Great.</i>

120
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,900
Well, the good news is that
I have it all figured out.

121
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,600
The bad news is it's a pen, not a wand

122
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,000
and you <i>are</i> going to owe the government 
<i>some</i> money for 2005 and 2006.

123
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
Ohh, really?

123.5
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600 
Aw, I got a kid in college.

124
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,400
The last thing I need
is some big, fat tax bill.

125
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Can't we cheat?

126
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,500
No, I'm just jokin'.

127
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,700
Are you hungry? I made some lasagna. 
Smell!

128
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,800
I still cook for four, even though 
all the kids are gone. I still do it.

129
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,100
I really do miss 'em.

130
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,600
- Do you cook?
- Well, that was Tom's department,

131
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,400
but, looking back, he really
didn't do much of that, either.

132
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,800
What <i>did</i> he do all day?

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh. Yeah, I guess that
takes up a lot of time.

134
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,500
Did you really try to kill your 
husband with your car?

135
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,500
Yeah... Couple o' times.

136
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,600
But, see, my granddaddy, he started 
this whole business.

137
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
And then <i>me</i> and <i>jackass</i> 
were running it,

138
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,700
you know, together.

139
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,100
And then, when we decided to get divorced, 
he tried to steal it from me, you know.

140
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
So I rammed him a couple times.

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,900
I don't know what the big deal is, 'cause, you know, because 
when Kathy Bates does it in <i>Fried Green Tomatoes,</i>

142
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,700
everyone claps and they cheer.

143
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,800
And then when <i>I</i> do it, it's like...
a felony, you know.

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,700
So, the Judge decides to take the whole business
and split it right down the middle.

145
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,100
Um, I have Travis and I have Hays,
and Bastrop. That's my section.

146
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,100
And he has Burnet 
and Blanco and Llano.

147
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,400
And as long as I stayed on 
my side, I'm fine.

147.5
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,900
Oh, shoot.

148
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,400
ABC Pest, big and small, we get 'em all.

148.5
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,600
Oh.

149
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Okay... Yeah, that would be great.

150
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,800
See you then.

151
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
I.R.S. guy on Friday.

152
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,900
Can we, uh, get you anything?
Maybe some coffee?

153
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,200
No.

154
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,700
How about a big piece 
of pecan pie?

155
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
No. Thank you.

156
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,300
Mr. Hutt, you know, I--

157
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,300
always wondered, you know,

158
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,700
how does someone choose a
career in the I.R.S.?

159
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
I mean, is it something 
you've always wanted to do?

160
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,800
Sorry, Hutt, keep failing
you psych evaluation.

161
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
But I'm on new meds.

162
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,200
Yeah. 
No.

163
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,200
Yes.

164
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Why don't you go file something?

165
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,700
Mm. Yeah, maybe I will.

166
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,600
Well, if you need anything at all, 
just let me know.

167
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,600
Well, everything seems
to be in order.

168
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,100
- You've done some good work here, Miss Case.
- Thank you.

169
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,600
Now, uh, we need to talk about
a payment schedule.

170
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
Right. Uh, my client was hoping to make
quarterly payments

171
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,600
spread out over... 60 months.

172
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
60 months? Ooh! 
60 months. Oh.

173
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,400
60 months. 60 months would 
be, uh, highly unusual.

174
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,200
But, uh, exceptions could be made.

175
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,400
Well, maybe we could, uh, talk about it,
you know, over dinner.

176
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,800
Oh! 
Um, I- I don't think that's a good idea.

177
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,100
Are you sure?

178
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
- Um, oops! I'm so sorry.
- Very hot.

179
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,400
Let me give you something, um...
Is that really hot?

180
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,500
- Yes.
- Oh, does it hurt?

181
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,400
Hey! Look what I just whipped up,
Want some fresh ham?

182
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
You'll be hearing from me, Ms. Agovino.

183
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,400
Drop by any time.

184
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,850
What's going on with his pants?

185
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,400
He asked me out to dinner and
put his hand on my knee,

186
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,100
- and then I just threw coffee on his crotch.
- Oh.

187
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,300
It was great.

188
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,680
Dammit! 
I saw that stain on his pants

189
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,000
and I- I thought you did me a favor.

190
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh well.

191
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,400
Oh yeah.

192
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,500
That's neat.

193
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
I was a half an hour late.

194
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
He hit you with a closed fist?

195
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,400
Oh, so, if he hit her with an open fist,
he's a half way decent guy?

196
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,400
- You have to leave him.
- I can't.

197
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
He said that if I ever leave him,
he'll find me and kill me.

198
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,000
Thank you.

199
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,000
My sweet little beautiful. Mm...

200
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,100
Where the hell were you been, baby?

201
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,910
Rick, please don't do this here. 
All right?

202
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,500
I asked you a damn question.

203
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
But... I think I already 
know the answer.

204
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
Being here with your little... bitch brigade.

205
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,100
It's not like that, okay?
We're just-- we're just having a beer.

206
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,900
Trying to get laid?

207
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,950
No, we're just having a beer.

208
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,300
I'll tell you what, that's fixin' to change tonight. 
C'mon. Let's go.

209
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,900
Rick, just stop it!

210
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Stop, okay?

211
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,900
Come on, asshole! 
Let's go! Huh?

212
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
I'll handle this.

213
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
- That's it.
- <i>Why you got two badasses in here?</i>

214
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
You got three seconds to get outta here
or you get the ugly stick.

215
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Uh, you're the ugly stick. 
I'll see you later, Gandit!

216
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,700
Okay?

217
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,300
You're not. Someone's got to 
take you to the hospital.

218
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,000
- <i>You might want to go out the back door.</i>
- <i>Yeah, bring her out the back.</i>

219
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,900
I'll take you. I'm still on
the Board at Memorial.

220
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,800
- Oh shit!
- Want me to go?

221
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,800
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

222
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Will you call us and tell us that she's okay?

223
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,300
I don't believe that just happened.
I <i>don't</i> believe it.

224
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,800
Come on, I gotta catch the bus, they're gonna stop 
running soon. We don't want him to come back.

225
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,200
- No, you know what? I'm gonna give you a ride.
- Are you okay to drive?

226
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,500
Yeah, I'm a little drunk, but that was
so sobering, I can't even tell ya.

227
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,900
Do you want me to drive?

228
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, if you drive, then I can drink.

229
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,100
That's so messed up.

230
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,100
<i>This car is as big as a boat.</i>

231
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Mm. And with my car issues

232
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,500
we should be riding in a monster truck.

233
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Hey! Is that that guy? 
That's Rick!

234
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Oh my gosh, there he is.

235
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,700
Oh, that jerk.
You got to follow him.

236
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,800
- Come on, you got to follow him!
- Okay.

237
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,300
What? I just wanna see 
where he's going.

238
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,500
Don't lose him.

239
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,400
- You're gonna have to speed up.
- Okay, okay. Calm down.

239,5
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
- <i>You can't lose him!</i>
- Okay!

240
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ah, man. What an ass.

241
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,600
<i>He's the number one asshole.</i>

242
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
<i>And, look, we're right up his crack.</i>

243
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
Hey, Stell, what happens when you go 
in one of Trent's counties?

244
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,500
Oh, well, technically, I could be arrested.

245
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,900
- This is crazy.
- No, this is fun!

246
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
This is like Charlie's Angels.

247
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,900
Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But the original with Farrah.

248
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,600
Where is this bastard taking us?

249
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,600
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I said I'm fine!

250
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:24,000
You know, I just can't believe that some... 
jerk like him, would-- would, I mean, 

251
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
what kind of animal would 
hit a girl like that?

252
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,100
- You said you were fine.
- I know.

253
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,400
But I lied.

254
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,700
I thought you only hit your husband!

255
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Well-- well, I'm expanding my operations.

256
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,300
Fuck you!

257
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Where-- Where'd he go?

258
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh, oh, wait! Look out!

259
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,700
- Holy shit!
- <i>...we gonna have a good time...</i>

260
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,400
Wow! Do you think he's dead?

261
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah, he's dead.

262
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,500
But... I didn't hit him <i>that</i> hard.
I'm going to jail.

263
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
No, I was the one that was driving.

264
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah, but thy're never going to believe that.
I'm the one with the record and the car.

265
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,100
Well-- well, should we call the police?

266
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,800
Yeah, you do that, 
we'll all really to jail.

267
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,200
It was an accident.

268
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,200
We're three drunk women
with assault records.

269
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Shouldn't even be allowed out the 
county for Christ's sake.

270
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,600
Cone on, let's get out of here. 
Come on.

271
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,600
What if the kids in
pick-up truck saw us?

272
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,000
No, no, no. 
They would've stopped.

273
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,200
Look, I think it's just best if we don't say 
anything, you know. Just get out of here.

274
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,000
No, I think <i>nothing</i> is suspicious.

275
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,900
You know, when I was in my dark place,
I watched a lot of <i>Law & Order</i>

276
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,200
and I realized that most
people get convicted

277
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,600
because someone confesses.

278
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,200
So if we keep our mouths shut
then we have a chance.

279
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,500
- I-- I do not want to jail.
- Me neither.

280
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,700
<i>Yeah, it sucks.</i>

281
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,500
All right, well... good. Deal. Let's get out of here. 
Then we won't say anything.

282
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,900
Okay, well,let's get our story straight, okay?
So you dropped me off at 11,

283
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,200
I drove home, I read, 
and I-- I went to bed.

284
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,300
I-- I took the bus.

285
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,300
No, don't take the bus 'cause the driver's gonna 
remember someone who looks like you at midnight, so

286
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,500
so Stella dropped me off at 11 and 
then she took you home.

287
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,100
Okay.

288
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,700
All right. All right. 
Well, I-- I gotta stop and get gas.

289
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,200
- Okay, just-- just don't stop anywhere.
- Why not?

290
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Because gas stations have cameras and then 
they'll know what time you were there

291
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,100
and we don't want them to know.

292
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,900
Wow, you are really smart.
How do you know this shit?

293
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,300
<i>Law & Order.</i>

294
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,300
I need another... drink.

295
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,900
<i>Rick was an accident.
We didn't mean it.</i>

296
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,900
<i>But what's done was done. We-- we were 
better off just keeping out mouths shut.</i>

298
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,400
- Stella.
- Yeah, I'm reading it right now.

299
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,800
And it says, "Probably due to a 
dimly lit road." Yeah.

300
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,900
Alex, hold on on a second.

301
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,900
ABC Pest. Big or small, we get 'em all.

302
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,400
Uh-huh, all right. All right.
Hold on, please.

303
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
- Hey, Gary?
- <i>Yeah?

304
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
We got a lady with a possum in a pool.
Can you please deal with this?

305
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,500
- <i>Got it.</i>
- Thank you.

306
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,300
- <i>Anyway, I jus--</i>
- Come in!

306.5
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
<i>--it's just so weird that they would print it.</i>

307
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,700
Alex? I'm gonna call you back.

308
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Hey! What's up?

309
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,400
I just came by to tell you 
I'm leaving town for a while.

310
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,400
Awww! What a bummer.

311
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,300
Is- Is Rick okay with that?

312
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
Rick's dead.

313
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,900
- What?
- There was a car accident...

314
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,900
The police said he must have been drunk
'cause the car went on off the cliff.

315
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,500
Uh! Gosh, that's horrible! 
I'm so sorry. Go--

316
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,700
- The police? Found him?
- Yeah.

317
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,000
They also said that some kids
saw an old blue car parked nearby.

318
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,300
Wow. 
Kids and... drugs...

319
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,300
Kids are so messed up nowadays.

320
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,000
Anyway, um...
I wanted to give you this.

321
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,900
Yeah, I've been saving up 
money for when I left him.

322
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,300
I don't need it any more.

323
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,900
- Kim, I- I don't know what's going on--
- Stella, just take the money.

324
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,900
Look, I- I told the cops that I was 
hanging out with you guys at the bar

325
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,100
before I went to the hospital,
so, they're probably gonna come here

326
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,000
and- and confirm my story.

327
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,900
- Well, you know--
- You should- you should get yourself a new car.

328
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,300
Quick.

329
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,800
Well, I- I just want you to know that it's 
not like they way you think it happened--

330
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,700
I don't wanna know.
Just take it.

331
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And thank you.

332
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,600
You're welcome.

333
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,400
Alex? Call Nikki.
We got to meet.

334
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Then, she hands me this. 
$10,000 in a hundred dollar bills.

335
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,700
That's $3,333.33 each.

336
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,500
Look, we can't keep it.
We got to give it back.

337
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,200
No we don't. She wants us to have it.
It's like a gift, it's like a baby shower.

338
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,100
Yeah, a gift! 
A very generous gift.

339
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,300
By accepting it, we acknowledge
that we did it.

340
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,300
- Oh yeah. You know, that's not good.
- Uh, yeah, but except for we did it!

341
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,700
We didn't do it on purpose.
You- you have to give it back.

342
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,000
I can't, I don't- 
I don't even know how to reach her.

343
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,500
Plus, she said she really
wanted us to have it.

344
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,300
Yeah, think about <i>her</i>, Alex.
It's not about you.

345
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,300
He was an asshole, anyway.
No one cares!

346
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,700
She's happy he's gone, you know?
Besides, uh, we really need the money.

347
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,200
Yeah, I know I do.

348
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,200
Okay, we keep it, but we 
have to do it legally.

349
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,500
We enter it as a receivable
from a client.

350
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,800
And then we pay the taxes on it and then 
we distribute it to ourselves as a salary.

351
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,700
You wanna give the government
some of that?

352
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Well, Uncle Sam doesn't care <i>how</i> the pie 
got baked, as long as he gets a piece.

353
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
You gotta be kidding me.

354
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,900
And, Stell, you gotta get rid 
of that car today.

355
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,700
- Yeah, even Kim said that.
- <i>Law & Order.</i>

356
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,800
Now we wait for the police.

357
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Very nice.

358
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey.
You can go now.

359
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,600
- Be sure you stay away from that candy.
- Thank you, Dr. McGuire.

359.5
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,300
See ya, kid.

360
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,700
Excuse me.

361
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,900
I'm Detective Burke and
this is Detective Gardner.

362
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Uh, were you working here
last Saturday night?

363
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,600
<i>Yeah, he came in and started
slapping her around,</i>

364
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,700
I showed him the ugly stick
and his way out the front door.

365
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,000
We went put for a few drinks, and then the asshole
shows up, he hits her and then they left.

366
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,100
- And that was about 11.
- What did you do then?

367
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Stella dropped me off at the office,
and then I drove home and went to bed.

368
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,400
I, uh, I dropped the girls off
and then I drove home

369
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,100
and I had a snack and 
then I went to bed.

370
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,300
I took a shower 
and went to bed.

371
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,850
What?

372
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,600
Alexandra Case? 
Austin College, Class of '97?

373
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,100
- Yeah, how do you know that?
- Class of '98.

374
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,600
Oh. 
Nice to meet you, I guess.

375
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm sorry, Detective, 
but Doctor-Patient Privilege 

376
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,600
prevents me from discussing anything
that's talked about in therapy.

377
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,200
Unless that person confesses their intention 
to commit a felony such as murder.

378
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,400
I can assure you Kim Clark never 
discussed killing her husband.

379
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,600
Our records indicate that Mrs. Clark
was in mandated therapy

380
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,800
for assaulting her husband with a fork.

381
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Do your records mention the events 
that led up to that incident?

382
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,400
I didn't think so.

383
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Prior to her arrest, Mr. Clark had beaten 
her over the head with a cell phone.

384
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
<i>He then threatened her with a knife.</i>

385
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:13,400
So she defended herself with a fork, 
stabbing him <i>once</i> in the chest.

386
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,700
And the Judge decided that is was <i>she</i>
that needed anger therapy.

387
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,900
I think it's pretty ironic, don't you?

388
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,720
Well, I think the bottom line  here, Ma'am, 
is that a man is dead.

389
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,800
A very violent man who was a spousal abuser
and a chronic alcoholic.

390
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,600
So, you think it's okay
that he's dead?

391
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,200
No, I'm just not surprised.

392
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:36,300
<i>Rick's body had a blood alcohol level of 2.0,</i>

393
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,700
<i>twice the legal limit.</i>

394
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,300
<i>So everyone just thought he lost
control of his car. Case closed.</i>

395
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,300
<i>Hey, Alex, hurry up!
The session's about to begin.</i>

396
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,400
Coming!

397
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,100
<i>And that would have been the end of it...
if it weren't for Danielle.</i>

398
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,850
So even though I'm surrounded by 
my household staff all day long

399
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,700
I just feel so alone.

400
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,700
Well, usually something triggers 
these episodes of despair.

401
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,200
<i>What happened?</i>

402
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,900
Well, um, I was watching this movie

403
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,200
<i>and this man is in a hotel room and 
wakes up with a hooker in his bed</i>

404 
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,100
and she's dead.

405
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,800
And he immediately gets on his phone
and calls ten friends.

406
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,400
And... it just got me thinking

407
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,700
that if I woke up with 
a dead hooker in my bed, 

408
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,900
I wouldn't have anyone to call.

409
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,300
<i>Thank you for sharing, Marsha.</i>

410
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh! Well, um, we're gonna
pick up next week on

411
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,600
Marsha's feelings of alienation 
and fears of abandonment.

412
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,700
But, before we end the day, I'd like
to introduce a new member to our group.

413
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,500
Or better yet, why don't
you introduce yourself?

414
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,800
Thank you.
Hi, I'm Danielle.

415
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,500
Her husband was this hotshot lawyer
and he always cheated on her.

416
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,400
She said the final straw was when she 
caught him with the Russian facialist

417
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,200
using the certificate that she 
gave him for Christmas.

418
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,600
She was staring at me. 
I mean, why was she staring at me?

419
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,500
<i>I know you guys always think
that I'm paranoid and stuff--</i>

420
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,100
- She knows.
- Yeah, see, I-- I dunno-- 

421
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Hey! Hey! I wondered if I could
talk to you a sec.

422
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
Sure. I mean, we're all friends here.

423
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,800
Listen, my friend Kim, she told me
I could talk to you about my problem.

424
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,900
To see if you could take care of it.

425
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,900
I'm sorry, but we can't help you.
Come on, guys.

426
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,400
You know, I can pay you.

427
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,800
<i>Yeah, he has that 
"home, a rich white guy" smirk.</i>

428
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,200
You guys, this is wrong. We shouldn't 
even be talking about this.

429
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

430
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,300
- What?
- She's right.

431
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,800
What?
Fine.

432
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,900
- So you're gonna tell her?
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna tell her.

433
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,400
I should have been suspicious. 
They gave in way too easy.

434
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,500
But I wanted to put it behind me

435
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,600
<i>because, suddenly, I had
other things to think about.</i>

436
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,700
Hey! Excuse me, but
the pumpkin pie is mine.

437
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,600
I don't see your name on it.

438
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Well, I-- I put it on the counter.
<i>Sir,</i> that pie is mine.

439
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,400
Is there a problem here?

440
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,000
Nope. No problem.

441
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,200
- Officer... Burns?
- Burke, Burke. Daniel Burke.

442
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,600
You didn't have to do that. 
I was resolving my conflict peacefully.

443
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just tryin' to help.
Uh, pumpkin's my favorite.

444
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,100
Thank you. 
Have a nice day.

445
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,300
Hey! Can I help you with your stuff?

446
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Oh, ah, it's okay, I'm fine.

447
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,550
Miss Case, I have a confession to make.

448
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,300
I thought it was the criminals
that make the confessions.

449
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,100
Well, in this case, it's the good guy.

450
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,900
Um, you-- you wouldn't this, but

451
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,800
in-- in college I had a 
terrible crush on you.

452
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,300
Well, since you have your dessert,
why don't you let me buy your dinner?

453
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Umm, I don't think that-- 
that's a good idea.

454
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,200
Oh, okay.

455
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,600
I mean, it's not for you, 
you seem really nice... and cute.

456
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,300
Um, I jus-- I just got out of this 
long thing with this big jerk, and

457
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,800
I just have, uh, a lot of issues.

458
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,100
It's just dinner, um.

459
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
It's never just dinner.

459.5
00:38:24:000 --> 00:38:25,400
Hmm. Um.

460
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,600
- Are you married?
- No.

461
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,400
- Engaged?
- No.

462
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,500
Okay, I just want to be clear,
so there's no confusion later,

463
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,000
is there anyone who would object
to you asking a single woman out 

464
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
in the fruit and vegetable and pie 
section of the supermarket?

465
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,000
Oh, you're-- you're 
interrogating <i>me</i> now, that's--

466
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,900
Bad answer, but thanks for playing.

467
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,200
Wait, wait, I'm sorry, the-- 
the answer is no.

468
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,700
There's no one out there that
would be, um, angry

469
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,500
that I, uh, whatever--

470
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,700
whatever it was you said, no. 
No.

471
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,900
So?

472
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,700
Christ!

473
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
<i>This guy is such a tool.</i>

474
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,500
Ok, well, calm down, 
we can figure this out.

475
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,400
No, I'm not gonna calm down!
He calls this a payment plan?

476
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,800
He's gonna put me out of business.

477
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,600
This makes no sense,
He wants everything in 90 days?

478
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,900
I know, I mean, I don't have 
that kind of money.

479
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Gosh, why don't you go out 
and have dinner with him?

480
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,900
Or, or ss-- I wish you'd 
slept with him.

481
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Come on, be a whore for a friend.

482
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,300
I know, I know, but--

483
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,000
- Shit!
- Hey!

484
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,100
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

485
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I work here now. The dentist fired me. 
Accident with the drill.

485
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400 
He lived.

486
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,300
So you're an exterminator now?

487
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,300
God, no, I'd never kill an animal.

488
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,400
She's just in here doing some stuff 
for me around the office.

489
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,500
We're expanding.

490
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Nikki, don't bore her with all this stuff. 
I don't think we're gonna be expanding anyway

491
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,600
'cause that guy's taking all my money.

492
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,000
So? How's your life going?

493
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>Stella suggested an herbal seance
for full karmic cleansing.</i>

494
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,100
<i>Then Marsha got me an interview</i>

495
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,400
<i>at her cousin's husband's
accounting firm.</i>

496
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,920
<i>And my dinner date turned out to be 
funny and charming and smart and</i>

497
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,200
he has a job.

498
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,000
What does he do?

499
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,000
He's, um, a--

500
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,100
<i>Since therapy is all 
about being honest</i>

501
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,420
I really should have said, "He's the 
detective who's investigating

502
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,200
the death of Kim's husband

503
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,900
which Stella, Nikki and I did by the way." 
But, what I said was...

504
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Postman.

505
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,400
A postman! Great!

506
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,800
<i>I did feel guilty about lying, but 
with my track record with decent men</i>

507
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,000
<i>I figured we'd be broken up
in a week, so, why bring it up?</i>

508
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
So when's your big date?

509
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,300
Oh, um, I wanted to talk  to you
about that later.

510
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,400
Just one more second!

511
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
Okay, so I preheated the oven.

512
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,000
No, the eggplant appetizer 
needs to be served cold.

513
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,600
Yeah, definitely. 
Yeah, it always tastes better.

514
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,700
But, the <i>chicken</i>, the chicken, you wanna take 
a little bit of brown sugar and sprinkle it on 'im.

515
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,700
And then, uh, then put it in 
the oven for 25 minutes at 350.

516
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,100
Yeah. No, he's gonna love it.
All men like that.

517
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,000
No, I'm proud of you.
I think you're doin' a good job.

517.5
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,400
Psst!

518
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,650
Oh, yeah, and, uh... (No, bigger!)

519
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,800
I need, um, actually...

520
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,100
You know, I want to ask you, this
doesn't look like chicken parmesana.

521
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,800
No, see, I didn't have mozzarella at all.
So, I made a baked chicken

522
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,200
with an onion <i>glazé.</i>

523
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,500
Yeah. And it worked.

524
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,900
<i>Yup. Psst! Psst!</i>

525
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,700
(Tape.)

526
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,800
<i>I have total faith in you.</i>

527
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,100
And I... absolutely. 
No, I think you're doing great.

528
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,800
And, uh, I hope you got a centerpiece.
Two!

529
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,400
<i>Well, I don't know, I like
green apples in a vase</i>

530
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,500
<i>and then just fill it with water.</i>

531
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Well, maybe, uh, next time.

532
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,800
Okay, I'm... done! 
What are you guys doing tonight?

533
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,400
Nothing. 
Now, on to the <i>Crème Brûlée.</i>

534
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,800
They're so cute.

535
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,100
So you keep the blowtorch on low.

536
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:57,800
And then what you do is, you just slow-ly, slowly 
fire it up so you don't burn the skin on top. 

537
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,700
Okay. Okay, blowtorch on low.

538
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,000
And that's about it.

539
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,300
Ohhh! Look!

540
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,200
Love that.

541
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,900
Thank you so much. 
I'll call you tomorrow.

542
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,400
<i>This is just in to us. An attorney from 
Houston has turned up dead in East Austin.</i>

543
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,600
<i>The body of private malpractice attorney 
Steven Cantor was found lying in an alley</i>

543.5
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,000
<i>behind the night club Chaos
around 3 in the morning.</i>

544
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,400
Sources tell us Cantor was bludgeoned 
to death with a golf club.

544.5
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,000
<i>The police believe it was a robbery gone bad.
Cantor's wallet and watch are missing.</i>

545
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,900
Cantor's wife, Danielle, has been 
unavailable for comment.

546
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,400
<i>Word is that she was vacationing
in Aruba with sons Jer...</i>

547
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,000
- Something smells good.
- <i>...at the time of the attack...</i>

548
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,400
<i>I told myself it was all a coincidence.</i>

549
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,500
<i>The papers said Cantor was 
high on Ecstasy and Viagra.</i>

550
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:54,700
<i>He was definitely out looking for trouble.
Maybe, he found it.</i>

551
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,500
<i> Either way, it was none of my business.</i>

552
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
You are an amazing cook.

553
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,900
It was nothing.

554
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,400
You know, my girdle is so tight, it's
making me breathe differently.

555
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,000
Hm. That's a bonus.

556
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
Oh my God, it's Alex!

557
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,300
Hey, Alex! I'm gonna put you 
on speaker phone.

558
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,150
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're at the mall.

559
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,100
<i>Well, damn, I need some things from there.
Why didn't you tell me?</i>

560
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,400
Mm, it was a last minute thing, Al. 
Sorry.

561
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,400
<i>What time you guys getting here?</i>

562
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,200
We'll be there soon, Alex. Real soon.
We just have one thing we have to do first.

563
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
- Alex, we gotta go.
- <i>Oh, wait! While you're there, can you--</i>

564
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,500
- Ready?
- Let's roll.

565
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,400
- <i>They came over?</i>
- Yes.

566
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,880
<i>You didn't notice the blood on her shirt?</i>

567
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,500
She said it was ketchup.

568
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,570
<i>And you believed her?</i>

569
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm not a suspicious person.

570
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,600
But then there <i>was</i> Saint Patrick's Day.

571
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,800
<i>We were all out celebrating early.</i>

572
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
<i>You know, singing, drinking...</i>

573
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,400
...a transvestite where it's...
a guy going into a girl

574
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,600
or it's a girl going in-- 
transgenderous thing but...

575
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,400
You can- You can rent him for the evenin'.
He comes to your house

576
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,400
and he, uh, he gives you blowjob lessons.

577
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,600
No way.

578
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,700
And I thought it would be great 
for a party, or, like, for--

579
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,100
we could- would could rent him for one of you. 
Marsha, he certainly, well, probably needs help.

580
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,700
Yeah...I'm Catholic.

581
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,400
I know, but guys won't pay 
for something like that.

581.5
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,200
Oh, niiice! Oh!

582
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,500
- I mean, like, we'll make the investment.
- <i>Yeah, yup. That's true.</i>

582.5
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,700
I'm joking.

583
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Oh my God, that guy just <i>groped</i> me.

584
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,000
- What? Where?
- What do you mean?

585
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,800
- That guy over there.
- Which guy? <i>That</i> guy?

586
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,200
- <i>Look- Look what he's doing.</i>
- You gotta to be kidding me.

587
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,500
This is the best. I love it!
I'm sorry.

588
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,000
Why does he think it's okay 
to get drunk and to do that?

589
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,900
- <i>I don't know.</i>
It's not.

590
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,700
- Uh-oh. Here goes crazy.
- Shut up.

591
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,000
Dude, dude, dude, dude!
Come on. Come on!

591.5
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,300
What's she gonna do?

592
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,300
I'm sorry, baby, hold on.

593
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,320
What's up, mama?

594
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,800
Hmm. Thank you. Oh, you're so cute.
He's so cute!

594.5
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,500
<i>Marsha, where do we go to 
hock our jewelry?</i>

595
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,000
- Wow!
- Oh! I mean, just give me enough time.

595.5
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Enough time and it's 
gonna be real somethin'.

596
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,700
Yeah, well, it would be best to 
use the state people.

596.3
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,800
It's like water in your hands.
They melt every mother fuckin' time.

596.6
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,000
<i>Babies, how beautiful. I love you.</i>

597
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:24,700
- Thanks for the light, Hun.
- Oh, mama, you got it. Ohh, baby Jesus!

598
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
Play it cool. Play it cool.

598.5
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,200
- <i>Alright, you know what? Marsha, you--</i>
- I- I- I- I-- 

599
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,890
Oh my God, we have to get out of here.

600
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,000
- Sit down! I'm gonna enjoy this.
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

601
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,200
Hey, dude! Dude! 
You're on fire!

602
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,300
- Oh shit! I'm gonna miss it!

602.5
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
- It's getting good!
- <i>Call the fire department. Quick! Quick!</i>

603
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,300
Silent Revolution, Al.

604
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,000
You know that guy could have 
really been hurt?

605
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,000
So what? 
He was an asshole.

606
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,000
You know, the city is full of assholes.
You can't go around setting them all on fire.

607
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
Why not?

608
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,100
Why not?

609
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,500
What?

609.3
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
<i>...asshole.</i>

609.4
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
<i>You know, the city is full of assholes.
You can't go around setting them all on fire.</i>

609.7
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
<i>Why not?</i>

609.9
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
<i>Why not?</i>

610
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,600
<i>...and there was six of us, all girls.
Hm! Poor father, God rest his soul.</i>

611
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,700
And, you know, he worked for the electric company 
and my mom was a housewife

612
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,800
and so we never had <i>any</i> money.
And I'm the fourth of six

613
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,300
so, forget about having anything new.

614
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,700
Which normally, you know, 
doesn't really bother me, but...

615
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,400
This one time, this is one time, I saw 
this dress in the window of Dress Barn

616
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
<i>and I wanted to wear it to my Junior prom.</i>

617
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,200
<i>God, I begged my mother.</i>

617.5
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,000
God, I begged her.

618
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Mm. But... then my sister Mary Beth 
goes and breaks her arm.

619
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,700
So there goes the money for 
the dress, you know.

620
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,110
<i>And I'm at school the next day,
bitchin' about Mary Beth and then</i>

621
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,600
<i>Bo Turner tells me
he'll pay me fifty bucks</i> 

622
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
<i>if I have sex with his older brother.</i>

623
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,800
<i>I mean,</i> 

623.5
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,900
You'll pay me?

624
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:26,400
These days you might say...
Michael was, I dunno, mentally challenged.

625
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,400
Back in the day, we just called him a retard.

626
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
<i>So I go over there after school
and I do it, no big deal</i>

627
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:37,000
<i>and I go find Bo to get my money.
And the loser refuses to pay me.</i>

628
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,650
I mean, I didn't actually think 
you'd go through with it.

629
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,300
<i>So I'm like, "You better pay me."
And he's like, "No, I didn't think you'd do it."</i>

630
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,600
<i>And I'm like, "Well, I did it, so pay me."
And then he's like, "No."</i>

631
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,000
<i>So finally, I tell him, "Pay me or I'm gonna 
tell the Reverend and your mother</i>

632
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
<i>what you asked me to do."</i>
You better find it.

633
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,500
<i>And he don't think I'm gonna do it.</i>

634
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,150
<i>And I'm like, look, I already had sex with him.
The worst part's over. Like, what do I have to lose?</i>

635
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,300
He pays me the money, I go straight
to Dress Barn, I buy the dress

636
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,900
<i>and they vote me Prom Queen.</i>

637
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,400
<i>Love that dress.</i>

638
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,800
<i>I still have it.</i>

639
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,700
So what about any of you? 
Anyone else here ever fuck a retard for a dress?

640
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,900
Um... Once I let my husband

641
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,300
put his penis in my anus 
for a Cartier necklace.

642
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,400
Does that count?

643
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,900
Yeah.

644
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,600
Hey, what are you doing home? I thought 
Tuesday was your night out with the girls.

645
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,900
- We had a fight.
- <i>About what?</i>

646
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,900
Nothing. You know, I'm sure 
it's gonna be fine. Um, how's work?

647
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,500
- It's busy.
- <i>Oh really? Okay.</i>

648
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,500
- Dan, we gotta move.
- Al, I gotta go, I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

649
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,600
- <i>Love you. Bye.</i>
- Love you.

650
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,600
<i>You can't tell you cop boyfriend that</i>

651
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,100
<i>your pals like to set 
drunken frat boys on fire.</i>

652
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,500
- Oh, hey. Alex!
- Hey. 

652.5
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,000
Hey! What are you doing here?

653
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,200
Oh, I just-- 
Is Nikki here?

654
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,100
Yeah... yeah.

655
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Hey, Nikki! 

655.5
00:55:11,000 -->00:55:13,000
<i>How you doing in there?</i>

655.7
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,300
<i>Yeah?</i>

656
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,900
- Uh, guess what? Alex is here.
- <i>Huh?</i>

657
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,300
- Alex.
- Hold on!

658
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,600
Why don't you... come on in? 
Uh... Nikki's just, uh, finishing up some work.

659
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,900
Cool. Thanks.

660
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,600
Hey, Nikki! 
Here we are!

660.5
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,300
- Hey.
- Hey!

661
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,500
- Cool outfit.
- Thanks, thanks.

662
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Look, um... I'm sorry about last week.
I think- I think I overreacted.

663
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,200
No, it- it wasn't your fault. 
I mean...

664
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:01,600
It was me, you know. And then--
Still not- still not using my words, you know. 

665
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,800
Forgive me.

666
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:13,200
- Of course. I just... really missed you guys.
- And we missed you! We did.

667
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,100
Talk about perfect timing.

668
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,200
- What?
- Yeah.

669
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,300
- Here, it says it's "Special Delivery"... from the postman.
- Thank you.

670
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,800
You guys are the best.

671
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,300
Hi, is Detective Burke here?
Thank you.

672
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Uh, guys, let's take 5.

672.5
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,500
Get in here.

673
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,100
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it, they're just jealous.

674
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,300
- Wow, what is that?
- Ah, city homicides.

675
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,600
Are all these pins dead people?

676
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,800
Ah, yeah, specifically males, 25 to 55.

677
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,700
Oh, and what are the different colors?

678
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,800
Well. The red are violent crimes. You know, 
stabbings, shootings, fires, that kind of thing.

679
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,500
He had this accident with a drill, you know.

680
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,920
Yellow are less violent, you know.
Like vehicular accidents...cars, bikes.

681
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,700
I lied.

682
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,700
<i>What are the white?</i>

683
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,000
Digestives. You know, poisonings?

684
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,800
- Mostly arsenic.
- Arsenic.

685
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,100
Yeah. Strange, huh?

686
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,100
Hey, I'm gonna go heat this up.

687
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,400
<i>Oh. How fast was that session?</i>

688
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,700
All right. Well... hold on to your problems
and I'll see you all next week.

689
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,200
- And then it was kind of fun.
- I don't know.

690
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,700
Hey! We're all going to the dive bar, right?

691
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,900
I think I'm just gonna go home.

692
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,100
Oh, come on! 
We're going to McNasty's. You know.

693
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,200
Well, I really have to catch up on my sleep,
so, um, see you guys later.

693.5
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,800
Uh! Really?

694
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,800
Should we follow her?

695
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,700
<i>...and I have a confession to make. You know, 
this, uh, pumpkin pie, when I say I love it so much,</i>

696
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,200
I really, really, really love key lime pie. 
Do you like key lime pie? I lov--

697
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,200
My mom used to do make it this, this way
and she put the crust on it with it. It just...

698
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,500
<i>Amazing. For really good behavior</i>

699
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,200
<i>she'd reward us with key lime pie.</i>

700
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,400
For just moderate behavior,
she'd reward us with pecan pie.

701
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,700
And, um... Is everything okay?
I- I feel like there's something on your mind.

702
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,000
No, I'm fine.

703
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,000
What's the matter?

704
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,200
What if you found out that a friend 
of yours was doing something wrong?

705
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,500
Something really, really bad. 
What would you do?

706
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,910
If you're really her friend... 
I think you try to get her to stop.

707
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,150
- Alex?
- I thought I saw a friend.

707.5
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,000
Aah!

708
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,100
<i>Who are you?</i>

709
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,020
Oh, Alex, I'm pretty sure 
you know who we are.

710
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:54,300
We've been waiting for you, Alex. And now that you're here, 
it's time for <i>you</i> to answer some questions.

711
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,600
Like, for instance, 
what in the hell is going on?

712
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

713
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,800
We've been sitting up in Heaven laughing 
about how you girls just pretend--

714
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh, come on!
You guys are in <i>Heaven?</i>

715
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,100
Hey! We're some damn good guys.

716
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:15,600
Oh, that's not what I heard. I mean, I don't 
think anyone misses you. You guys are jerks.

717
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,550
- Hey, hey! Our mommies miss us. A lot.
- Yeah.

718
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,200
Well, I don't think that counts cause I'm sure
that <i>Ted Bundy's</i> mom misses <i>him.</i>

719
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,100
I never killed anyone, 
unlike certain people... in this room.

720
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,500
All right, well I understand why you're haunting me,
but what are <i>you</i> doing here?

721
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,100
Jesus, she still doesn't get it.

722
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,930
We would not be here 
unless <i>you</i>... let us in.

723
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,100
Why would I do that?

724
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,400
Because you know what's going on, Alex.

725
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,000
You know what they're doin'. You know what 
they're doin' and it's your job to stop it.

726
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,700
I don't wannna talk about it.

727
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,800
- Come on, Alex.
- Wake up, Alex!

727.5
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:02,200
- Al-ex.
- Wake up, Alex. Wake up, wake up, wake up...

728
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:08,200
Hey, Alex. Alex, wake up. 
Alex! Alex, wake <i>up!</i>

728.5
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,200
- Ahh!
- Jesus!

729
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,100
- Uh uh uh!
- "Postman", huh?

730
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,900
- I'm sorry about that.
- We trusted you, Alex.

731
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,100
- Yeah, we thought you were our friend.
- Well, I'm still your friend.

732
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,200
Then why didn't you say anything?

733
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,900
Yeah, I wasted a whole 
Bray's rack of lamb on you, too.

734
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,500
Well, I didn't tell you because
I didn't think it was gonna work out.

735
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,700
- What did you tell him about us?
- Nothing, I would never tell him about Rick.

736
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,500
I was the one driving, remember?

737
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,600
- Ah.
- What's going on here?

738
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,000
We woke up with a dead hooker in our bed

739
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,000
and we don't have anyone else to call.

740
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,700
So you guys ain't gonna... hurt me?

741
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,600
Alex, my God, you gotta stop 
watching those cop shows.

742
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,100
They're making you weird.

743
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,400
No... 
We want you to be happy.

744
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,200
It's just... I've got some big
shit going down.

745
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:01,800
What?

746
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,700
I'm being audited and I need your help.

747
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,500
So why don't you just pay Uncle Sam 
what he's owed and be done with it?

748
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,100
- Uh. 
- It's a little more complicated than that.

749
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,200
Yeah. We had a little side business going.

750
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,500
Well, what kind of side business?

751
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,000
Well, it was... pest removal.

752
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,670
Four-legged... or... two?

753
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,200
Do you mind if I take a shot?

754
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,800
No shit, huh?
Really? A whole bulletin board!

755
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,000
You guys, I don't understand 
how you could do this.

756
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,000
We're sick, Alex.
You know that.

757
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,900
- We have issues.
- <i>Yeah, you know.</i>

758
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,300
We can't really help it.
These guys were assholes.

759
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,900
We only did it to the guys that deserved it.

760
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:01,100
- We actually turned a lot of women down.
- Yeah.

761
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,000
I gotta know, do you think 
the police are onto us?

762
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:09,580
Well, I don't think so, but they might be soon.
You guys gotta stop doing this right away.

763
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,500
I know! We will. 
We <i>will.</i>

764
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,430
Alright, we will, but...

765
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,400
It's just this... damn I.R.S. guy, you know. 
He's a problem.

766
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,100
This is where you come in.

767
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,300
I have this whole money mess thing happening and 
I need you to straighten it out before Tuesday.

768
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,400
Well, I don't get it.
Why is money is a problem?

769
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,900
- I did what you did.
- You put it through the company?

770
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,600
I didn't wanna break the law.

771
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,800
I mean, you're the one who said, that, you know, how Uncle Sam 
didn't care how the pie gets made, as long as he gets a piece.

772
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,650
Well, how big... is the pie?

773
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,000
It's pretty big.

774
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,700
Even I'm not that good.

775
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:04,600
- Oh, come on, Alex, we need your help.
- Alex, please.

776
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,800
Oh, come on. Really, Alex?
We... we need you.

777
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
<i>That's what every fixer loves to hear.
That someone needs them.</i>

778
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,800
I wasn't doing anything wrong.
I was... just doing my job. ABC was my client.

779
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:27,070
I was like Switzerland or the military.
"Don't ask, don't tell." Right?

780
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,000
How did you guys come up with
the idea to use arsenic?

781
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,900
<i>They saw on T.V.</i>

782
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,200
Oh yeah, but this one is an old classic.
It's called <i>Arsenic and Old Lace.</i>

783
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,900
You know, Cary Grant...

784
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,250
I mean, jus' no one's better than Cary Grant.
If I was gonna build a man, I'd build him.

785
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,900
I just love that they kill him with arsenic, you know. 
Put him in the window seat. It's great.

786
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,900
Oh! 
I think she just douched with patchouli.

787
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:10,200
Oh, wait.. you-- this... this is it. 
It looks like enough?

788
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,100
No, way more.

789
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,100
- Hi.
- Hello.

789.5
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,100
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

790
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,900
Hi, Harmony.

791
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,100
Um, I was just wondering how much this is.

792
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,800
- It's, uh, $84.50 a pound.
- Oh.

793
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,300
- Arsenic, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, I actually need it for my work.

794
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,500
- Oh.
- We're exterminators.

795
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,900
Don't you guys use, uh, chemicals for that?

796
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:54,600
No, actually, uh...
you know, with everyone going green now,

797
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,900
uh, we came up with a more holistic approach.

798
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,200
Just because you're gonna kill something,
doesn't mean you hafta harm the environment.

799
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,000
- Yeah.
- I see.

800
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:10,200
Well, um, how much of this stuff 
would I need to kill a rat?

801
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:17,000
- 'Bout... that much... right here.
- Oh.

802
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,850
What about a horse?

803
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,100
Mmm... like, two of those.

804
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,400
Could we-- do you have any in back? 
We need enough to kill a whole herd of horses.

805
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,900
You know, actually, water's the problem.

806
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,800
You know, because you got to get them to 
drink a lot of it or else it doesn't work.

807
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,900
So liquor, wine... <i>no problemo.</i>

808
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,600
- It was that easy?
- <i>Yup!</i>

809
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:47,150
And then, you know, word got out and pfff! You won't 
believe how many unhappy women there are in this world.

810
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,900
And no court of law is ever 
gonna give them justice.

811
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,700
Well, didn't it ever occur to you guys 
that you could be caught?

812
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:58,000
You know, the Lakota Indians... they believe 
that when you've made a decision

813
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,100
you know, and you've... 
really committed to something,

813.5
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:05,900
that the whole universe aligns 
behind you, you know, to kind of...

814
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,080
propel you forward.

815
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,800
I know, I think the Indians say it better, 
but I know what you mean.

816
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,200
You get it, though. Right?

817
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,700
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

818
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,300
Is there anything else you'd like 
me to explain to you, or...?

819
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,000
Miss Case, this would probably go a lot 
faster if I had some privacy.

820
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:38,300
Oh. O- o- okay, We should, uh,
go... around the corner. Sorry!

821
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:59,190
Damn! I wanted that.

822
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,500
Miss Case!

823
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,400
- Uh! I'm going to need to... take these with me.
- Great!

823.5
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,000
I'll be, uh, in touch in a few days.

824
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,400
Why am I nervous?

825
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,580
Well, hello there, handsome.

826
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,600
Oh... Kim Clark?

827
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,500
Naw. She don't live here any more.
She moved <i>months</i> ago.

828
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,100
Well, can yell me where I can 
find her, it's important.

829
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,000
You a cop?

830
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,660
Not exactly, I'm with the I.R.S.

831
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:49,000
I'm investigating a case and
I need to talk to Kim Clark.

832
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,900
Can't help ya. She moved <i>months</i> ago, 
right after her husband died.

833
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,900
- And you are...?
- Rita.

834
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,600
Rita what?

835
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,100
Rita not-tell-you-my-last-name.

836
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,200
Well, can you tell me where I can
find the person who runs this place?

837
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,100
You're lookin' at 'er.

838
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:12,500
Oh. Well, maybe you could 
explain something to me...

839
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:17,000
Uh, did this building have any 
kind of infestation problem,

840
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,300
say, around the time Mr. Clark died?

841
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,900
Are you tryin' to say that 
my property is <i>dirty?</i>

842
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:28,270
I'll tell you <i>right</i> now, I had 
the Housing Inspector out here <i>last</i> month

843
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:30,940
and we got a clean bill of health!

844
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,850
Okay. I-- I'm... Sorry. I'm sure you did.
I'm not trying to insult you.

845
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,850
I'm just trying to find out 
why Mrs. Clark paid

846
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:42,300
an extermination company a rather 
large sum of money last fall.

847
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,600
Well, it wasn't for no <i>bugs,</i>
I could tell you that.

848
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,950
Well, all right, then.

848.5
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,700
You're free to go.

849
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Yes I am. And you're free 
to stay away from here!

849.5
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,900
If I see you again, I 
take a shotgun to <i>you!</i>

849.6
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,300
<i>Get out of here, you Mr. I.R.S Man!
I've had it with you. I've had it!</i>

850
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,200
You're a very rude person.

850.5
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,400
<i>Oh, you government guys (indistict)
...they're all the same.</i>

851
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:12,000
Oh ho ho! Yeah, back to ya, buddy!

851.5
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,800
Hey, I got a double dose for <i>you!</i>
Government man.

852
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,200
Hi! Can I help you?

853
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,300
I'm sorry to bother you, but

854
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,200
I'm Robert Hutt, I'm an investigator
with the Internal Revenue Service.

855
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,400
- Oh! 
- Who is it, Blanca?

856
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,200
It's, uh,  Mr. Hutt... 
from the Internal Revenue Service.

857
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:43,700
- I'm Danielle Cantor.
- <i> ...wanna talk to you a sec.</i>

857.5
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,000
<i>We're all friends here.</i>

858
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,900
Can I help you?

859
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,400
I've missed you these last few days.

860
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,500
Me too. I've been so busy.

861
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,700
Yeah, I know, your friends.
I understand.

862
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,500
- But there's something we need to talk about.
- What?

863
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,200
Alex, these last few months have been great.

864
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,550
And I want us to be 
together... always.

865
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,900
But... honesty is the most important thing in a 
relationship, so there's something I need to know.

866
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,900
Can you <i>really</i> cook?

867
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:39,600
What?

868
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,100
I mean, don't get defensive,
but come on!

869
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,000 
At your house, we have 
lamb shank, brochettes...

870
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,800
At my house you can 
barely boil water.

871
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:49,400
I can't cook. That was Stella.
She's been doing it.

872
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,400
I knew it! Oh my God, don't cry.
Please don't cry.

873
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,800
It's no big deal, really.

874
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,300
I just... something I  needed 
to know before I did this...

875
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,120
Alexandra Case... 
Will you marry me?

876
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,460
Oh my God.

877
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,200
Okay, this is the part where you say "Yes".

878
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,400
Yes! Yes! Yes!

879
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:33,400
I love you, Alex.

880
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,530
I love <i>you.</i> But maybe there some things I should 
tell you about, some things that I'm not proud of.

881
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,800
Whatever went on before... 
doesn't matter.

881.5
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,720
The only thing that matters is what 
happens from this day forward.

882
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,200
- Really?
- Here, come here.

883
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,600
'Cause I don't wannna lose you.

883.5
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,180
You won't.

884
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,450
- Excuse me, Miss Case.
- Ohh... Mr. Hutt.

885
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,000
I'm sorry to interrupt
your little celebration

886
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,800
but I thought I should
you know I've discovered

887
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,200
some discrepancies with the work 
you did for ABC Pest.

888
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Oh, well, I find that hard to believe,

888.5
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,900
but if you wanna call me at my office, I'd be 
happy to talk to you about it tomorrow, so...

889
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:36,050
- Excuse me.
- It can't wait.

890
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,380
If you don't get outta my way,
I'm gonna scream!

891
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,820
Oh, please do. 
Call your little cop boyfriend.

892
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:52,300
There's a lot of things I'd would <i>love</i>
to tell him about <i>you</i>... and your friends.

893
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

894
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,600
Don't be <i>stupid,</i> Miss Case.

895
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,600
Remember... we're the I.R.S.

896
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,800
I know <i>everything</i> about you.

897
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:12,200
I know you graduated 16th 
in your class at Austin College.

898
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,000
By the way, the boyfriend 
was only number 437.

899
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:19,700
I know you spent more money on your hair 
than you do on food.

900
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:25,700
I know you got your living room chairs at 
Neiman Marcus, $750, including delivery.

901
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,700
I know your parents are dead and
your sister lives in Connecticut.

902
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,400
I also know you finally 
got yourself a nice guy.

903
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:37,100
And what you and your friends have 
been doing could ruin everything.

904
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,800
What do you want?

905
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,200
The numbers in that ledger
are a lie and you know it.

906
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:49,700
You tell me everything you know about 
ABC Pest, I become a hero to my bosses

907
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,980
and the bad guys... or <i>girls,</i>

908
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,000
go to jail.

909
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,200
And he doesn't have to know a thing.

910
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:05,900
It's him or them, you choose. 
But if I don't hear from you within 48 hours,

911
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:12,300
I'm going to have to pay a little visit
to Officer Daniel J. Burke, number 437.

913
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,500
Hey. What's going on?

914
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:23,600
I just, uh, feel really... dizzy from the wine.
Do you mind if we go home?

915
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,250
Yeah, it's been a big night. Come on.
You all right?

916
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:33,600
Well, this is a really big day, girls.
We have a graduate here.

917
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,500
Congratulations, Alex.

918
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:41,100
I mean, to think a year ago...
you walked in a miserable,

919
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,000
<i>angry, sad and depressed woman.</i>

919.5
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,000
<i>And now look at you.</i>

920
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,300
You're this happy and vivacious woman
with her whole life ahead of her.

921
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,400
I've done great work.

922
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,400
Alright. One last trip to McNasty's.

923
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,800
I think I should go home.

924
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,100
- Oh, come on.
- What?!?

924.5
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,180
<i>No. No, no, no!</i>

01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,250
You <i>do</i> you realize this is it, right?

926
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,300
- Come on, one last drink.
- It's never just one.

926.5
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,400
<i>Shh! Here she comes. 
Shh!</i>

927
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,800
Surprise!

928
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,070
Please, everybody!
Could you grab a glass?

929
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,500
It's- it's good champagne.
I paid for it.

930
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,600
And I just- I just like to say a 
very quick thing and make a toast.

931
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,100
I know you're expecting me to say something really <i>funny</i> 
right now, but I'm not gonna do that.

932
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,100
Because, uh, I really just wanna say...

933
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,400
that... our friend Alex really defines 
the definition of a true friend, and

935
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,900
I know we all love her here, and 
we're all gonna really miss her.

936
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,850
So, we love you, Alex. Yeah.

937
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,400
- To Alex.
- To Alex!

938
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:02,800
Hey, I wanna take up smoking 
so I can have skin like yours.

938.5
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,500
Man...

939
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,700
Think they'll ever let us graduate?

940
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,000
No!

941
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,600
Okay, that wouldn't be 
a good idea, would it?

942
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,600
I need a drink.

942.5
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,500
Happy.

943
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,200
Does anybody wanna play pool?

944
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,700
- Heyyy!
- Hey.

944.5
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,800 
Are you all right?

945
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,500
Yeah, I was just thinking that, um...
that everything good in my life I owe to you guys.

945.5
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,000
Awww!

946
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,400
I'm gonna really miss you.

947
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

948
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,400
<i>That'll do fine, Miss Case.</i>

949
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,100
Jesus, it's hot in here!

950
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,000
I want you to know... 
I really tried to do the right thing.

951
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,900
I really did.

952
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,700
But one thing I learned in therapy... 
is that I don't always have to do the right thing.

953
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,800
I mean, sometimes I can just do...
what's good for <i>me.</i>

954
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,900
<i>You understand that, don't you?</i>

954.5
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:24,100
Do you need more water?

955
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:36,800
They say that water is a problem,
you hafta... drink a <i>lot</i> of it.

956
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,900
What have you done?

957
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,400
I did what any girl would do if she woke up
and she found a dead hooker in my bed...

958
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,650
I called my friends.

959
01:22:58,450 --> 01:22:59,400
All right!

960
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,100
<i>Investigators have identified the 
badly decomposed body of a white male</i>

961
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,600
<i>found by workers in a 
Texas motel last week.</i>

962
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,600
<i>Sources say he is Robert Hutt,
from the Internal Revenue Service.</i>

963
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:09,600
<i>They tell us that Hutt had been under investigation
for conduct unbecoming a federal officer.</i>

964
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,550
<i>When police searched his home,
they discovered private files</i>

965
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:16,600
<i>of young women that Hutt has allegedly 
harassed over the last 20 years.</i>

965.5
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,900
<i>In other news, fire...</i>

966
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,200
Okay. Places.
Here you go.

966.5
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,750
<i>Beautiful!</i>

967
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,080
- <i>Okay.</i>
- You ready?

968
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,200
Let's get you married.

968.5
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,000
Okay, here we go.

968.8
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,500
Whoo!

969
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,600
- <i>I don't get it.</i>
- <i>You were right.</i>

970
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,100
Out with the old and in with the new. 
Whoo!

971
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,000
You're officially out of business.

972
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,600
<i>Goodbye, ABC Pest.</i>

973
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,700
And hello ABC Catering.

974
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,400
- <i>Cheers to working hard.</i>
- <i>Cheers to that.</i>

974.5
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,260
Thanks.

975
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:28,600
Did you see <i>that?</i>

976
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:33,100
- Was that the, um, Chief of <i>Police,</i> Stella?
- Yes it was.

976.5
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,200
- You're amazing.
- And, uh, not only are we going out

977
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,000 
on a date tomorrow, but, uh,

978
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,720
he's taking me to a gun show.

978.5
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:40,800
<i>So awful.</i>

979
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:44,100
He took everything. 
Even my credit cards.

980
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,500
- <i>When I get the bill,</i>
- Uh oh. 

980
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,100
he put her new boobs on my Visa.

981
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,900
Oh my God!

982
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:54,500
You know, we're officially out of business.

983
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,800
Yup. Officially, we are.

984
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,000
- Are you thinking about what I'm thinking?
- I'll follow you.

985
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,000
All right.

986
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
