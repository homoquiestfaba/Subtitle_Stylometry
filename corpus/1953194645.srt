fill this out, please.

You're taking her away?
Not now, Val.

175
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,197
But it's coming.
You know that.

this is your place? This is your
barn? This is where you live, huh?

all right? I'll just, uh...

Good morning.
I see your watchdog alerted you.

You're trying to say that she
was protecting me from that thing?

What happened?

195
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,518
Is that snake poisonous?
No. Dad, it's fine. Really.

196
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,274
I think you're gonna have to forget
about sleeping in the barn, Rand.

No, it's okay,

Dr. Thompson, it's all right.

Elsa is the very best protection you
can find. She doesn't miss a thing.

200
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,514
And I don't mind her staying
out here with your son,

Uh, yes, I meant to discuss this with you
earlier, but with everything happening,

212
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,557
I thought we'd settle down a little.
Greystone's is the best school in the country.

It's in the capital.

the way things are done here.

to discuss this with you.

You know, the thing is, you haven't discussed
anything with us. That's the problem, okay? Because...

live, how we live. But no, you treat us like babies.

230

Because we sat down and discussed

we can do about it. We are in Africa.

the most appropriate school.

She ran off as soon as
the shooting started.

667
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,678
The other lion wasn't so lucky.
Sorry, Val, but it's time now.

668
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,316
What are you saying? You're gonna send Elsa to
a zoo because some male lion was pestering her?

669
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,318
She's attracting them.
It's a dangerous situation.

670
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,637
If the goatherd hadn't killed the lion,
the lion might have killed the goatherd.

671
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,798
Now, I can't wait
till somebody gets hurt.

672
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,993
I'm coming by for Elsa before dark.
You see that she's there.

673
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,272
Ondine, sorry for the disruption.

674
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,312
I'm sorry I ever started all this.

675
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,354
I feel like letting every one
of them go right now.

676
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,630
They would die, Val.

677
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,832
They'd die.

678
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,635
What you do for them is important.
You think so?

679
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,274
But it's too hard when it's time
to say goodbye.

680
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,475
Come on, Victor.

681
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,592
Before somebody wants you
for their stupid zoo.

682
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,395
Come on, Elsa. Up you go.

683
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,832
How long untie she goes?

684
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,878
A few days.
Can we come and see her?

685
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,992
Of course.

686
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,640
This doesn't feel right.

687
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,637
Well, do you want to
go see her or not?

688
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,239
I don't know.

689
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,273
It might just make things worse.

690
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,196
It's so weird seeing her
in a cage like this.

691
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,670
Mm.

692
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,198
Wait.

693
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,440
Wait a minute, Val...

694
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,111
RAND: Miss Luello,
what are you doing here?

695
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,312
I live here. George is my brother.
Oh.

696
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,999
I take it you've come to see Elsa?

697
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,279
Uh, no. Actually we've come by
to see Mr. Luello.

698
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,755
We'd like to release Elsa
back into the wild.

699
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,996
Oh. Well, you'd better come in.

700
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,599
The odds are very bad. Isn't it
best for Elsa to live in a zoo?

701
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,429
And what kind of life is that?
Safe, secure.

702
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,990
Like a prison?
She deserves a chance to be free.

703
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,555
And we're willing
to work with her.

704
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,911
Do you two have any idea
what you're getting yourselves into?

705
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,555
Do you know how Elsa got
her name?

706
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,320
Your brother named her
after the original Elsa,

707
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,075
the lion that the lady raised-
Joy Adamson, yes.

708
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,352
Have you read her book?
No.

709
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,029
Before embarking on such a task,
I suggest you do your homework.

710
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,392
And believe me, before asking
Mr. Luello for anything,

711
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,479
you'd best be well-prepared.
Good luck and good reading.

712
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:31,908
Thanks.
Thank you.

713
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,912
You're welcome.

714
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,720
The answer is no.

715
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,235
And I don't appreciate your stunt
with the book.

716
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,635
It will just give them wild ideas.

717
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,110
At least they can prepare
a proper case.

718
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,477
There is no case. That
situation was one in a million.

719
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,750
This lion cannot survive
in the wild,

720
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,190
and we can't have her
running around loose anymore.

721
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,192
Her only hope is the zoo.

722
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,075
George, how can you be so sure
she won't survive on her own?

723
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,998
Doesn't she at least
deserve a chance?

724
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,749
All this to do about one lion. I'm
responsible for millions of animals, Ondine.

725
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,713
Why are you making such
a fuss about Elsa's future?

726
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,678
It's not Elsa's future
that concerns me.

727
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,833
RAND: Val and I have given this a
lot of careful thought, and we believe

728
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,918
that Elsa has a legitimate chance
of survival in the wild

729
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,510
if she is properly and systematically
introduced to the elements.

730
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,878
Yes. My staff and I cover more
than two million acres of wildlife.

731
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,072
We don't have so much time
for " properly and systematically. "

732
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,993
We're only asking for a minimum
of support from your staff.

733
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,475
Rand and I plan to do
all the training ourselves.

734
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,999
And who's going to train you?

735
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,879
Well, wait a minute. Joy
Adamson wasn't a trained expert.

736
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,311
She loved her Elsa. She did the
best that she could, and it worked.

737
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,751
We have the benefit of her experience. We
don't even have to make all the same mistakes.

738
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,594
No, because you'll be making
plenty new ones of your own. Come.

739
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,394
I want to show you something.

740
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,438
All right. This is Elsa's normal diet,
meat with kibble,

741
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,315
and this is what she'll be eating
in the wild, if she's lucky.

742
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,752
All that proves is that she goes
for the easy stuff first.

743
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,638
She would starve in the wild.

744
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,310
VAL: No. She'd learn from the
other lions, be part of a pride.

745
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,438
More like they'd kill her.
She belongs in a zoo.

746
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:39,754
Val and I have made scientific observations in the
field that contradict your position, Mr. Luello.

747
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,956
Scientific observations?

748
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,759
While we were lost,

749
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,077
we had a chance to spend some time
with Elsa in a natural environment.

750
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,114
She didn't kill her food.
No, but she did fit in.

751
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,312
And we think she found
a boyfriend.

752
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,672
We see offshoot scientific
implications to this endeavor.

753
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,112
Okay, one, how to influence animal
behavior, heredity versus environment,

754
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,709
conditioning by kindness
or harshness.

755
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,428
Offshoot scientific implications?

756
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,832
Miss Luello said she'd give us credit.
I did?

757
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,635
For special projects.
Uh, yes, I did say that.

758
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,796
You gotta admit,
this is pretty special.

759
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,118
Good try, but the answer is still no.

760
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,395
Well, they are right, you know?
I beg your pardon?

761
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,514
Well, there's no logical reason why
Elsa can't be successfully integrated.

762
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,314
You see, the Adamson's experiment
changed everyone's thinking.

763
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,197
I mean, since then,
there's been countless examples.

764
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:50,513
Lions, wolves, even condors.

765
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,678
Mr. Luello,
this is obviously your call.

766
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,749
But speaking strictly as a scientist
and based on scientific evidence,

767
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,236
Rand and Val have every reason
to expect success

768
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,630
if they're given a chance.

769
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:16,557
I'll give them two weeks.
Three. Please.

770
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:22,037
All right. Three weeks.
Yes. Thank you.

01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,158

That's one way of putting it.

She's hungry.

She's supposed to be hungry.

01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,672
I think she's starving.

Maybe she is, but tomorrow
she's gonna hunt her own dinner.

788

Will she know how to do that?

789
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,949
If she's hungry enough,
her natural instincts will take over.

How do you know that?

You don't mean that. Think
of what you would have missed.

Fine for us, but all wrong for Elsa.

gets into the real wild country.

01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,310
Dr. Thompson, isn't it?

834
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,069
Yes, and you are?
I'm Selena Wilkinson.

835
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,556
Oh.
Yes.

836
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,116
Yes.
I believe Eleanor has spoken of me.

837
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,595
Yeah.
If you don't want my help,

838
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,518
believe me, I'll understand.

839
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,438
But I wanted to offer it anyway.

840
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,670
You see, I've been sitting
at home for a month,

841
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,791
pouting over your good fortune,

842
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,911
and there's something
wrong with that.

843
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,030
If I were in your shoes and
qualified help were around the corner,

844
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,470
I'd wonder why I
didn't step forward.

845
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,835
Well, I really don't know what to say.

846
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,196
Well, say yes, doctor.

847
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,795
Oh, yes, please.
I mean, of course.

848
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,430
Good. Robert, in here.

849
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,591
This should come in handy.

850
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,837
Yes. Yes, indeed.

851
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,519
That thing suits you.

852
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,309
Well, I wouldn't be caught
dead riding this in the city.

853
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,556
From Future Business
Leaders of America.

854
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,672
Yeah. Let's see.

855
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,311
Yeah.

856
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,468
Collins. Collins Brokerage.

857
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,154
The apprenticeship. I got it.
They want me in the office on Monday.

858
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,836
Wow, an airplane ticket.
This outfit doesn't fool around, huh?

859
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,112
Room and board, a salary.
Dad, this is an incredible opportunity!

860
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,278
Sure sounds like one,
if that's what you want.

861
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,999
It's okay?

862
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,234
Thank you. Thank you.

863
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,594
Hey, uh, what about
your friend there?

864
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:56,989
Elsa. Well, I'm gonna miss
the final release, of course, but...

865
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,555
Come on, Elsa!
She's gonna be all right.

866
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,517
Dad, this is
an incredible opportunity.

867
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,393
This is a once in a lifetime chance.
Come on, girl!

868
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,989
Geri, I didn't plan it
this way, okay?

869
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,670
I didn't want to come
to Africa in the first place.

870
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,393
Will you come back?

871
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,039
Yeah. Yeah, I'll come back
to see, uh...

872
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,800
You know, to see Dad
and Gina. You.

873
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,992
But not Elsa. She won't be here.

874
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,037
No.

875
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,319
What about Val?

876
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,796
Well, I'll come and see Val too.

877
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,998
No, I mean, have you told her?

878
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,711
It's on my agenda.

879
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,638
Big day for Homer, huh?

880
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,752
His idea of freedom
is the palm of my hand.

881
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,477
Listen, uh, about
tomorrow and Elsa.

882
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,397
Uh...

883
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,235
Something's come up...

884
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,268
and I can't go.

885
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,790
What?

886
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,751
I have...

887
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,393
I have an incredible chance to
intern at a brokerage back home.

888
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,233
They sent me an airplane ticket
and everything.

889
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,153
I guess this is goodbye for now.

890
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,353
I'll write you.

891
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,393
I hope you'll write me and tell me
how things work with Elsa.

892
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,160
Elsa will be
in the Rotterdam Zoo.

893
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,439
RAND:
But it's all set up with George.

894
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,433
You and I were going
to free Elsa together.

895
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,835
I can't believe how wrong
I was about you.

896
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,835
You had me completely fooled.

897
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,955
I thought you really cared...

898
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,313
about Elsa.

899
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:28,709
I do. I do care, but this is a dream
that I had long before I met you or Elsa.

900
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,797
And if you're suggesting
that I pass this up-

901
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,359
I'm not suggesting anything.

902
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,548
Maybe this is hard for someone
like you to understand.

903
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:41,231
That's right. It's hard for someone
like me to understand. Goodbye, Rand.

904
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,238
Val.
There's nothing to say.

905
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,273
Just go on home
and have your dream.

906
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,232
I want to forget
I ever knew you.

907
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,718
Rand?

908
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,472
Something wrong?

909
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,839
Yeah, it's Val.

910
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,436
Oh.

911
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,909
She must be upset.

912
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,916
Yeah, she is.

913
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,276
You know...

914
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,071
I've been thinking about this...

915
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,108
and Collins Brokerage is okay.

916
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,959
It's not top of the line
by any means.

917
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:56,872
And if you're serious about this, I
don't want you settling for second best.

918
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,279
Maybe the timing's wrong.

919
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,994
No, you're right about Collins.

920
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,351
The market is down a little bit.
Yeah, mm-hm.

921
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,439
You can always reapply in summer.
Yeah. I suppose I could sign up.

922
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,714
You know, I hate to go
back on my word, Rand.

923
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,632
But...

924
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,518
I'm going to have to insist
that you pass this up.

925
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,399
If you're insisting, then...

926
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,191
I'm sorry, Rand, but I do.

927
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,190
I understand.

928
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,638
So, uh...

929
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,630
I guess this means that
I'll be here for Elsa's release.

930
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,548
Oh, I guess so.

931
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,756
I, uh...

932
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:58,550
I don't suppose there's any
chance that you could come with us?

933
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,312
Oh, uh, well, I'll be there.

935
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,233
Come here.

936
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,352
I'm not gonna go. I made up
my mind. No, I'm gonna stay.

937
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:31,710
Yeah?
I'm staying.

938
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,912
I'm staying.

939
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,397
Hi, Dad.
Hi.

940
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,279
What are you doing here?
Sure do get involved in your work.

941
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,473
I've been here for two days already.
So have Azizi and Maleaka.

942
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,793
Oh, it's gotta be the uniform. It must
be the uniform. I'm not that oblivious.

943
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,992
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm afraid you are.
It's been very amusing to watch.

944
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,038
Look. Whose idea is this?

945
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,719
This is a clinic. People die here.

946
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,957
I don't think Gina's ready for this.
David, David, look at her.

947
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,875
She has extraordinary
patience and skill.

948
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,476
She is not a little girl anymore.
Or haven't you noticed that either?

949
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,478
So you think you can handle
having me as a coworker?

950
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,749
Absolutely. Actually, this is
something I've been wanting you to do

951
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,394
for some time. Now, maybe
you can get your boss

952
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,114
to give you a couple of days off
to see Elsa set free.

953
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,074
Oh, Dad, I love Elsa,
but duty calls.

It's nothing serious.
It's just a few scratches.

01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,510

were attacking a lion.
