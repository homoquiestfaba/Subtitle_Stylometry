181
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,272
Sorry, man.

182
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,108
Sorry about that.

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,485
What are you doing here?

184
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,988
Uh, well, my mom wanted me to
pick up some 40s of malt liquor

185
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,282
for us to have with lunch,
so I figured, you know,

186
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,908
while I was here,
I'd hang outwith my cousin

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,495
for a few minutes.

188
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:00,374
What, your mom sent you
to go get 40s?

189
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,918
Reed, have you completely
lost your sense of humor

190
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,129
in the last four years?

191
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,506
Come on.
Right.

192
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,258
Um, well, anyway,
I got to go.

193
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,052
I have to go
cover this story.

194
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,595
The zorse has returned.

195
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:13,804
Oh, great, okay.

196
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,599
Well, it's so good
to see you.

197
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,226
Yeah, it was really good
to see you too.

198
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,523
Do you want
to come with me?

199
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,201
Hey, hey.

200
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,453
Oh, he's almost here.

201
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:41,373
All right,
give me the apparatus.

202
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,833
Hey, Frankie.

203
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:43,876
[laughs happily]

204
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:44,877
Jill.

205
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,128
It's so good to see you.

206
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,213
It's good to see you too.

207
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,799
This is a surprise.

208
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,927
Yeah.

209
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,179
[chuckles]

210
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,806
Don't you have a show
to do or something?

211
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,432
Oh, yes, right.
Of course.

212
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,601
I don't know;
start with a medium shot.

213
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,061
And I'll zoom
the zorse.

214
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,396
Okay.

215
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,690
Gosh, it's so cool that you're
the new voice of Mud Meadows.

216
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,901
I mean, I practically grew up
listening to your dad.

217
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,694
[baby crying]

218
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,114
[Frank over headphones] Mr. Fish,
stop staring at her boobs.

219
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,115
We're working.

220
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,157
(Reed)
Dude, I'm not.

221
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,283
Shut up.
What?

222
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,744
No, no, no, no,
nothing that concerns you.

223
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,371
Anyway...

224
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:23,040
So, you know, while you're here,
you should come on The Fish.

225
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,208
What?

226
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,709
No, you don't want me
on your show.

227
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:26,710
What?

228
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:27,711
Local girl makes good.

229
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,171
People eat that stuff up.

230
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,798
But I haven't made good.

231
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,924
You went to college.

232
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,135
That is not making good.

233
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,886
It is in Mud Meadows.

234
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,221
Come on, it'll be a cakewalk.

235
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,640
Okay, but I don't know.

236
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:40,891
Well, we'll figure
something out.

237
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,393
How long are you here for?

238
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:43,727
Um, all summer, actually.

239
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,396
[cell phone rings]

240
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,649
(Frank) Hey, Reed, your eyes
are 45% bigger, by the way.

241
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,985
[whispering]
Seriously, shut up.

242
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:51,986
[Frank cackles]

243
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:54,363
I'm so funny.

244
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,032
Yeah, but, you know,
I just needed to come home,

245
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,117
just regroup-.

246
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,535
(Frank)
Nice shirt, Reed Fish.

247
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,996
I don't know--take some time
away from my life, you know?

248
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,081
Right, yeah.

249
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,666
That's cool.

250
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,376
Yeah.

251
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,961
Hey, we should hang out.

252
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:12,548
You know, like old times.

253
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,137
I'm getting married
in three weeks.

254
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,973
Oh, yeah? To Kate Peterson?

255
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:21,974
Oh, you heard?

256
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,352
No, just lucky guess,
l guess.

257
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,645
What about you?

258
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:27,938
You, uh, getting married?

259
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,273
Oh, no.

260
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,526
Uh, my boyfriend, Gabe, and I
are kind of just--

261
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,153
(Frank)
Sorry, you guys

262
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,571
but the zorse
has arrived.

263
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,739
All right.

264
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:38,699
Yeah, quit zorsing around
and get to work.

265
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:40,201
[laughs]

266
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,120
[clears throat]

267
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,121
Want to press the button?

268
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,539
[whispering]
Yeah, just tell me when.

269
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:52,213
On one, okay?
Okay.

270
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,633
It's a very special day
in Mud Meadows as Zeke,

271
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:59,929
our one and only zorse, makes
his triumphant return home.

272
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,765
How's--how's Zeke
feeling today?

273
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:05,809
Oh, he's excited,
but he's glad to be home.

274
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,396
(Reed)
Oh, that makes sense.

275
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,731
And so it's a cross
between a...

276
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,484
A zebra
and a thoroughbred racehorse.

277
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,526
And who impregnated who?

278
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,779
(woman)
The daddy's the zebra.

279
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,113
(Reed)
The daddy's the zebra.

280
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,657
And I hear
that he likes apples a lot.

281
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:20,658
Is this true?

282
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,159
(woman)
Yeah.

283
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,577
(Reed) Oh, fantastic.
Shall I try to feed him?

284
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,496
(woman) Yes; in fact,
I think he wants one.

285
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,705
[horse grunting]

286
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:31,794
That's a good boy.

287
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,129
Fish out.

288
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,383
(Irv)
What do you do with it?

289
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:38,884
Do you ride it?
Do you milk it? What?

290
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,345
Oh, yeah,
you just zorse around, I guess.

291
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,555
[chuckles]

292
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,556
[clears throat]

293
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,226
Hey, did Katie tell you

294
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,811
how many cars
she sold last month?

295
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,438
She is the number one
salesperson

296
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,941
in the entire
Peterson retail empire.

297
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,651
Oh, please.

298
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,529
Just--just let your old man
be proud of you, okay?

299
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,655
(Maureen)
You know,

300
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,657
I'm still thinking salmon

301
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:02,950
for the wedding.

302
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,493
I think that's gonna
be really nice, Maureen.

303
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,371
Wait, I-l thought the choices
were prime rib or chicken.

304
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,039
I thought that
those were the options.

305
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,375
No, babe, the color
salmon for her dress.

306
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,376
Oh, right.

307
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,502
Because I'm a Pisces.

308
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:14,920
Oh, right, yeah.

309
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,964
Hey, did you get your
measurements in for your tux?

310
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,549
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,967
Oh, good.

312
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,053
Hey, which reminds me,
you ever smoked a Cuban?

313
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,972
Daddy.

314
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,974
I think I'll just help Kate
with these dishes,

315
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,934
and then
I really got to go home.

316
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:33,355
Well, okay, looks like it's
just the boys then, mano a mano.

317
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,738
So, uh, Irv, what is
the difference between,

318
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,615
like, a Cuban
and a regular cigar?

319
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,327
Well, a Cuban
is made in Cuba.

320
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,996
[chuckling]
Besides that.

321
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,664
It's, you know, richer.

322
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:51,707
It's fuller.

323
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,126
It's more flavorful.

324
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,003
I tell you what, though.

325
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,588
In reality, it's the embargo.

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,049
It's just a lot more exciting
to smoke an illegal cigar,

327
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:03,844
you know?

328
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,642
Something wrong there, kiddo?

329
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:12,895
[sighing]
Yeah.

330
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,563
It's all this wedding
crap, ain't it?

331
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:15,689
Yep.

332
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,779
It's just...

333
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:22,821
I don't know.

334
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,407
It's kind of weird, like...

335
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,992
Irv, we're going
to be family.

336
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,204
Hell, you've always been
a member of this family.

337
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:34,083
Man, your--your dad and me
were like brothers,

338
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:38,253
and Nancy and your mom, they...

339
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,380
[clears throat]

340
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,965
Yeah.

341
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,634
Well, they'd just
be damn proud of you

342
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,094
is what I'm trying to say

343
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:49,598
and not just the wedding
but your life--everything.

344
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,979
You're doing exactly
what you were born to do.

345
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,858
You know, this--this town
depended on your dad.

346
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,318
Now they depend on you.

347
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,117
And I couldn't be happier
about you and my Kate.

348
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:14,248
I mean, it's going to be
tough on me when she moves out.

349
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,839
[coughing] Which reminds me,
there's a little something

350
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,968
I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

351
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,137
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

352
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,555
It's about your wedding night.

353
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,479
Um...

354
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,106
[clears throat]

355
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,733
I don't know
how to say this.

356
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,861

You know my Katie's
a virgin, right?

359
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,911

as a favor, man to man...

Virgin.

365
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,343
[laughs nervously]

366
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,012
I just totally
freaked you out, right?

367
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,054
Yeah.

368
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,097
Sorry.

369
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,432
Irv, I think
I'm gonna throw up.

370
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,309
Well, can you do it over there
behind the gazebo?

371
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:16,477
Yeah, you bet.

372
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:17,478
There you go.

373
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,106
Good boy.

[phone ringing]

376
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:36,121
Hello?

377
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,080
Morning, sleepyhead.

378
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,207
Rise and shine.

379
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,666
You don't want
to be late for work.

380
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:40,751
[sleepily]
Hey.

381
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,004
No, I--l am up, up, and up.

382
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:49,968
Well, I mean, I have
the alarm set, AKA Maureen.

383
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,595
Oh, okay.

384
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,764
[Reed over phone] You look
very pretty this morning.

385
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,057
And how would you know that?

386
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,642
Oh, because you look pretty
every morning.

387
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:57,726
[sweetly]
Oh.

388
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:58,769
Aw.

389
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,354
Oh, that's so sweet.

390
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,898
Now, listen, don't forget we're
supposed to meet Mrs. Sandstrom

391
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:03,941
after the show today.

392
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,984
Okay.

393
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:10,364
Oh, and hey, Kate, try to--
try to not zorse around too much

394
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,074
at work there today, okay?

395
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,825
Heh.

396
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,911
Um, Reed, just so you know,
that joke isn't funny.

397
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,121
Don't use it on the show.

398
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,581
Okay.

399
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,250
Give me a kiss.

406
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,110
up to speed
on your life, Jill.

407
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:51,238
So after you graduated,
you went to college.

Talk into the microphone.

409

Oh, yeah, sorry.

410
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:56,660
Right.

411
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:57,995
Yes, college,

at Austin.

413
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:04,001
And your degree was
in economics, right?

414
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,461
But I heard a--
I heard a wee bit of a rumor

415
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,796
through the grapevine--

416
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,507
I heard a wee bit of a rumor
through the grapevines

417
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,176
that you're going
to law school this fall.

418
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,722
Well...

419
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,059
Word gets around.

420
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:22,769
Yup. Yes, it does.

421
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,022
That's--that's just
Mud Meadows for you.

422
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,189
Oh, you know,
but I miss it so much.

423
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,984
I mean, I actually
really miss Mud Meadows.

424
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,527
It's so good to be back.

425
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,154
Just--I don't know.

426
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:35,324
It just gives me perspective
or something.

427
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,327
I just keep wondering
why I ever left

428
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,369
in the first place.

429
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,163
Yeah, Why was that?

430
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:45,042
Why--why did you leave?

431
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,544
I guess it's just that
all my dreams and aspirations

432
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,171
weren't right next door
to my house.

433
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:54,009
My life wasn't
already set up for me.

434
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:57,012
I wasn't so lucky.

435
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:00,515
Not everyone can be.

436
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,310
Well, it looks like
we've got some calls,

437
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,936
so let's go to the phones,

438
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:10,525
which, today, is sponsored
by Peterson Sporting Goods.

Peterson Sporting Goods: your

Hello, caller,
you're on The Fish.

441
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,326
(Patricia)
Reed, Patricia Rafferty.

442
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,994
Hi, there, Patricia.

443
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,080
Um, do you have a question
for Jill?

444
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,791
No, my business is with you,
Reed.

445
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,168
[mouthing]
Shit.

446
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,045
Why, well, what seems
to be the trouble?

447
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,547
Well, I was walking my grandson
to school this morning

448
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,675
and crossing the street
of Jackson and Cedar,

449
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:35,759
and we were almost run over.

450
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,511
This car came out of nowhere.

451
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:40,055
(Reed) Yeah, yeah, I know.
That's a very bad intersection.

452
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,058
(Patricia) Well, maybe the mayor
would like to come on the air

453
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,268
and explain why
there's no stop sign there.

454
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,145
Well, yeah, I mean,
hey, come on, Patricia.

455
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,316
We all know that Maureen
is really just a figurehead.

456
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,320
So, no, I think
we'd be much better off

Reed, this is George Henderson.

462
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,125
Look, I appreciate
Miss Rafferty's concern,

463
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,460
but I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do about it right now.

464
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:11,920
The budget's too tight--

465
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,089
Look, no, I understand that
you guys are busy, George,

466
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,924
but this is, like,
a public safety issue.

467
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,844
I mean, what about dipping
into your discretionary fund

468
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,262
to pay for a little bit
of overtime?

469
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:21,722
Well...[sighs]

470
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,724
That fund's only
for special circumstances.

471
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,560
And taxpayers' children
nearly getting run over to death

472
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,562
doesn't count
as special circumstances?

473
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,522
[George sighs]

474
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,898
Fine.

475
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,817
I'll have a crew over there
tomorrow.

476
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,026

Yes!

477
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,153
Thank you very much, George.

Oh, my God,
it's so good to talk to you.

Oh, uh, she's good. Thanks.

Oh, no, you did.

Hey.
Hey.

509
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,505
Oh, it's so good to see you.

510
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,923
Yeah, it's been
way too long.

511
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,090
I know.

512
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,843
Hey, congrats on hooking
this Fish here.

513
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,178

you're in town for the wedding.

Man, it's a summer
of weddings.

You know Andrew
and Theresa are--

Yeah, well,
Reed's in that wedding.

519
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,602
Did he tell you?

520
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:51,978
He's one
of Andrew's groomsmen.

521
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,104
No, no, no,
he didn't mention it,

522
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,773
but Andrew did, like,
ten times, so...

To go where?

your own damn shoes anymore.
