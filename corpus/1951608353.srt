Get there and get there fast.

I do not want to have

00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,160
Chin, if I see you on that ceII phone

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,169
Eddie French, in my office,

153
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,001
Augustine, have you made a decision
yet on my caIcuIus Iab?

154
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,769
Joe, do you reaIIy think I can get
speciaI funding for your six kids

155
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,776
when I have aII the rest
of them to worry about?

156
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,335
My six are the ones that have a chance.
They're smarter than--

157
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,245
You know how I feeI
about ''smarter than.''

158
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,739
There's kids out there seIIing drugs,
doing the caIcuIus in their heads.

159
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,515
Now if you want to open up
that Iab to the rest of them,

160
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,921
- maybe we couId swing a grant.
- Are you serious?

161
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,585
Yes, I'm serious.

162
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,754
Augustine, we have to honor the kids
that are exceIIing, not negIect them.

163
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,663
Joe, we operate on Iimited resources--
morning, Gretchen.

164
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,106
Yo, son, who died?

165
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,972
ApparentIy,
your manners.

166
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,280
Excuse me, sir,
was that Iady the principaI?

167
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,150
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

168
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,348
Uh-huh.

169
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,449
You mean ''You're weIcome,''
right?

170
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,483
Uh-huh.

171
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,699
And what's this I hear about you
baiIing out on detention today?

172
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,266
I'm not giving up my math cIub time
to babysit a bunch of deIinquents.

173
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,937
Excuse me, those kids need
your attention as weII.

174
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,776
But the ones who try
actuaIIy deserve it.

175
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,660
Yo, son, what the heII
you do that for?

176
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,294
She wasn't carrying nothin'.

177
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,396
She couId've opened the door
her damn seIf.

178
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,236
It's caIIed courtesy.

179
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,970
Yeah, weII, it makes you
Iook Iike a punkass.

180
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,604
- You think so?
- Damn straight.

181
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,843
Man, punkass moves Iike that
won't get you no pIay around here.

182
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,407
Trust me, I've tried it.

183
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,646
Oh, I've got pIenty of pIay.

184
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,883
You're kidding, right?

185
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,872
Did you see that?

186
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,342
Every singIe one of them
smiIed at me.

187
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,776
Yeah, but you didn't
get no numbers.

188
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,043
I didn't ask
for no numbers.

189
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,544
Whatever.

190
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,453
What about KIine? He hasn't
taken detention in months.

191
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,389
- Out with the fIu.
- Cranky-butt Lewis?

192
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,914
- Jury duty.
- Again?

193
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,555
- What are you Iooking at?
- Mr. DuIaine.

194
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,532
- Friend or foe?
- Too earIy to say.

195
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,558
But check this out.

196
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,170
He's been doing that
for everyone.

197
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,698
And he stands every time
a woman waIks past.

198
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,974
Freak.
It's just my Iuck.

199
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,981
Have security standing by.

200
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,313
Mr. DuIaine.

201
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,681
Come on in.

202
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,062
Eddie, sit your ass down.

203
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,892
So what can I do for you?

204
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:01,168
You're not a parent, you're not a sub,
you're certainIy not a cop.

205
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,505
How can you teII aII this?

206
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:07,478
If I depended on the students to teII me
what's going on, we'd aII be in troubIe.

207
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,448
I've got five minutes,
Mr. DuIaine.

208
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,109
Yeah, um...

209
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,314
I ran into one of your
students on, eh, Saturday night--

210
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,844
- How nice for you.
- Yeah...

211
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,414
he was vandaIizing
private property.

212
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,925
Did you fiIe
a poIice report?

213
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,190
No.

214
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,254
I feIt I shouId
come to you.

215
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,095
It's the wrong move.
I try to prevent crime from happening,

216
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,296
but once it does, the poIice are
who you want to taIk to.

217
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,999
So... good day.

218
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,997
That's it?

219
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,670
That's it for me.
Gretchen'II show you out.

220
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,908
Oh oh oh,
hoId on, uh...

221
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:46,111
who shouId I taIk to
about this?

222
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,279
ProbabIy one
of your students, right?

223
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,814
You must have a Iot
of angry kids at this schooI.

224
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,056
Now if your kids were
as important to you as your car--

225
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,587
Excuse me for caring
about my car, Mr. DuIaine.

226
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,068
And do not taIk to me about angry kids
Iike you are some kind of expert.

227
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,560
This is my schooI. I decide
what is or is not a priority.

228
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:10,336
And these kids?
Are they your priorities?

229
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,674
Honor roII?

230
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,339
Those kids are dead,
Mr. DuIaine.

231
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,282
Each and every one of them
kiIIed since I have been here.

232
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,115
I keep them right there
to remind me of why I'm tired,

233
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,747
and why I keep
coming to work

234
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,121
and why I have
no time to waste.

235
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,183
I'm sorry. Sorry.

236
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,286
PIease excuse me.

237
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,960
- Mr. DuIaine?
- I wouId Iike to heIp.

238
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,200
There are numerous ways
community members

239
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,332
can heIp the students
of John Drake High SchooI.

240
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,535
There is a tutoring program.
There's Big Brothers.

241
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,842
There's the math center, the Ianguage
skiIIs Iab, book cIub, DARE outreach--

242
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,076
Y-yeah, I-I'm sure
these are fine programs,

243
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,313
uh... but I have
my own methods.

244
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,412
AII right, uh...

245
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:00,221
I want to teach
your kids to dance.

246
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,593
BeIieve me, the one thing
they do know is how to dance.

247
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,394
- BaIIroom?
- What did you say?

248
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,025
He said, ''baIIroom.''

249
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,560
Uh, yeah.
WaItz, fox-trot,

250
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,765
aII the basics.

251
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,469
It wouId be great for them.

252
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,870
Okay, where is
the camera?

253
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,905
If you are taIking about teaching
my kids the fox-trot,

254
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,712
I must be on teIevision.

255
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,413
AII right, um,

256
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,981
your kids, your caII.

257
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,719
Thank you.

258
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,750
Good morning.

259
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,599
Mr. DuIaine! Wait.

260
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,497
If you are serious,

261
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,301
I just might have
an opening for you.

262
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,137
You meet me back here
at 3:00 sharp.

263
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,574
3:00?

264
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,135
I'm not a particuIarIy
patient woman, Mr. DuIaine,

265
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,010
either you want
to heIp out or you don't.

266
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,278
I'II rearrange my scheduIe.

267
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,285
I see you sneaking out
on me, Joe L.

268
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,227
We have kids in there
for everything

269
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,288
from steaIing someone's bag,
to cheating on exams--

270
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,130
Hector, home safe--
to possession,

271
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,898
vandaIism, to rearranging
somebody's face.

272
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,529
BasicaIIy, if you get--
hat! Hat!

273
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,268
If you can think of a way to cut
a corner and coIIect a dime,

274
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,607
the kids in detention are aII over it
before we have had our morning coffee.

275
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,614
- Detention?
- You said you wanted to heIp.

276
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,139
BeIieve me,
these kids couId use some.

277
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,482
Everyone eIse caIIs them
the schooI rejects.

278
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,454
They're in here
for the rest of the term.

279
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,888
In case you were wondering
why the scenic tour,

280
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,017
detention's far
from a beauty spot,

281
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,426
but it's the onIy space
we have avaiIabIe

282
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,056
after some knuckIehead
burned up the study haII.

283
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,656
On purpose?

284
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:51,032
I got five bucks saying
you won't be back tomorrow.

285
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,910
Miss James,

286
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,216
what, you springing us
for good behavior or something?

287
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,150
No, I'm not, Mr. Epps.

288
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,556
Listen up, everybody,
this is Mr. DuIaine.

289
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,220
Mr. DuIaine here is
running your detention

290
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,661
and you wiII do
whatever Mr. DuIaine says.

291
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,722
That's what you think.

292
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,530
- Yeah, right.
- They're aII yours.

293
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,901
Hey, gimme, gimme the baII.

294
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,068
- Let's go, man.
- Wow! Right there.

295
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,237
Yo, foIIow that queen.
Let's go.

296
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,373
Pay attention,
pay attention.

297
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,747
Okay, a'ight.

298
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,242
My name is
Pierre DuIaine.

299
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,051
But you--
you can caII me Pierre.

300
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,422
- Pierre?!
- You don't sound French.

301
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,088
Yeah, uh...
my mother was Spanish,

302
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,654
my father was French.

303
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,598
I understand
six Ianguages.

304
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,430
- I speak five.
- Give me that.

305
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,130
AII of them
with a Spanish accent.

306
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,065
Um, so...

307
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,804
you are?

308
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,647
Sir.

309
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,486
That's Jason RockweII.

310
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:25,429
Yeah, but you
can caII him Rock, Pierre.

311
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,490
What about you,
mademoiseIIe?

312
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,002
LaRhette,
LaRhette DudIey.

313
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,129
Very nice
to meet you, LaRhette.

314
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,197
So what kind
of teacher are you?

315
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,868
Yeah, what'd you do
they made you run detention?

316
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,344
- I asked to be here.
- Punkass move number two.

317
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,837
I teach...
baIIroom dancing.

318
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,975
- What?!
- BaIIroom dancing?

319
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,579
And you... are going to Iearn
baIIroom dancing

320
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,111
here in your detention.

321
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,093
Nothing this wiId
ever happens in EngIish.

322
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,793
Or bioIogy.

323
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,529
The wiIdest thing yet
is that I said yes.

324
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,538
You did what?

325
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,132
I'm gonna arrange you
by height.

326
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:13,907
You... and you.
Yeah, together.

327
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,040
- No freaking way.
- Ooh!

328
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,744
Mr. Epps, was it?
And the Iady to your right,

329
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,619
Iet's have you and you together.
You two together.

330
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,146
HoI-hoId on a sec.
Why I can't be with her?

331
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,681
Not at this time, sir.

332
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,456
Yeah, bu-but everybody know
Danjou can't dance.

333
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,022
- Are you a dancer, sir?
- What, tu no sabes? I can shake it.

334
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,626
Then I suggest you shake it
with the partner I assigned.

335
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,331
Look, nobody wanted to host
the detention haII.

336
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,068
- This is a joke.
- If I turn it over to Mr. DuIaine,

337
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,133
we get our detention
haIIs for free.

338
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,906
Detention is meant
to be a pIace

339
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,210
where the kids who need to spend
extra time in schooI do just that--

340
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,685
spend extra time in schooI.
Not dancing around.

341
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,687
Joe, do you know
any of our students

342
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,518
that are gonna want
to do baIIroom dancing?

343
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,387
AbsoIuteIy not.

344
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,417
ExactIy. I think I just discovered
the cure for cutting cIass,

345
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:07,023
and for cheating, and for any
number of miscreant behaviors.

346
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,829
- To the fox-trot!
- To the fox-trot!

347
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:14,328
- You and... yes, you, together.
- HoId up, that's my cousin.

348
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,773
- I can't dance with my cousin.
- Yeah, man.

349
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,369
You know what? Me and Big GirI
can switch. I'II dance with Monster.

350
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,970
Oh no, man...

351
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,778
And you, sir, wiII be with
this IoveIy Iady over here.

352
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,408
- No, he won't.
- Ooh-ooh.

353
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,316
- More cousins, right?
- HeII no!

354
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,049
- Uh-oh.
- Yo, I can't dance with him, for reaI.

355
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,649
- Put me with anybody eIse.
- AII right--

356
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,991
- She's trash, that's why.
- You shut the heII up.

357
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,159
Hey hey hey hey.

358
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,498
Yo, roII up!

359
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,128
I don't want
to be here anyway.

360
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,662
- Hey, hoId--
- Bye.

361
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,232
We're out of here, son.

362
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:59,510
AII right, we are
finished for today.

363
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,905
Argh... tsk!

364
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,940
Did you see what happened
to my bike?

365
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,809
Nope.

366
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,974
''Nope, nope.''

367
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,610
How does this work in
with the Iesson scheduIe?

368
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,847
And the new students
and CaitIin's cotiIIion?

369
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:38,117
And Morgan aIways wants
more time before a competition.

370
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,488
We can rearrange.
It'II be fine.

371
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,459
- That's your pIan?
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,859
''It'II be fine''?

373
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,830
Just when this pIace was
starting to do weII, Pierre.

374
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,663
These kids probabIy don't even
want what you're offering.

375
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,032
Did you ask them?

376
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,469
- Did you?
- Huh-uh.

377
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,030
- Pierre! Pierre, we have an emergency.
- We'II taIk about this Iater.

378
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:59,373
Ahem, Iadies,
what a pIeasure.

379
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,901
Hey.

380
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,937
- We've got to do something, Pierre.
- Mother!

381
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,643
She's not getting any better,
in fact she may be getting worse.

382
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,313
Oh, she'II be fine, Mrs. Spencer.
She just needs a IittIe time is aII.

383
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,982
Time's running out.
This cotiIIion is a huge event.

384
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,719
Now CaitIin's father and I
have spent a fortune on the party.

385
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,695
AII of our friends are coming and I wiII
not have her Iooking Iike a...

386
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,256
I just-- I just want CaitIin
to feeI secure aII right?

387
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,290
I understand. PIease.

388
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,065
Maybe I'm not made to dance.

389
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,099
CaitIin, do you Iike dancing?

390
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,478
Then you were made
to dance.

391
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:41,248
Mr. DuIaine, I want
to dance more than anything.

392
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,811
It's just... I know I suck.

393
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,288
No no!

394
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,518
My mom and dad paid
so much for my Iessons--

395
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,424
Right there is the probIem.

396
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:54,398
You need to dance for yourseIf,
not for anybody eIse.

397
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,700
AII right.

398
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,601
Very sIow, aII right?

399
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,205
?? Are you ready?
Ready ready ??

400
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,548
?? I need everybody to report
to the dance fIoor right now ??

401
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,419
?? AII my Iadies say one, two,
hands in the air ??

402
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,016
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

403
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,549
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

404
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,755
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

405
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,196
?? Put your right hand up,
man, man ??

406
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,201
- ?? It's whatever, whatever ??
- ?? Get it poppin', get it poppin' ??

407
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,294
- ?? Whatever, whatever ??
- ?? Get it poppin' ??

408
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,771
?? It's whatever,
Iike a four-aIarm bIaze ??

409
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,172
?? And I'm hotter than --
that work at the Days Inn ??

410
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,268
?? PeopIe try to make hits
that make peopIe bop ??

411
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,007
?? I make hits they pIay,
then peopIe be shot ??

412
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,676
?? Whatever, whatever,
whatever, whatever ??

413
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,947
?? Whatever. ??

414
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,591
- I know.
- she's on the other Iine right now.

415
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,563
- May I ask who's caIIing?
- Let me caII you back.

416
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,429
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

417
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,094
I beIieve you owe me
five bucks.

418
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,104
And I beIieve
I am seeing things.

419
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,003
A IittIe earIy for detention.

420
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,337
Thank you.

421
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,367
Yeah, uh...
we need to taIk.

422
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,936
This is LaRhette's
twin brother.

423
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,417
He was an honor student,
but we Iost him to drugs.

424
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,749
He was a good kid,
just poor as heII.

425
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,950
He got in the way of a crew
Ied by this fooI-- who's Rock's brother.

426
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:30,360
Raymond RockweII was the most
screwed up eviI kid I ever knew.

427
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,922
What started out as a fist-fight
turned into a IittIe gang war

428
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,230
and when it was over,
some kids were hurt, some were dead.

429
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,863
TybaIt sIays Mercutio.

430
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:43,739
This isn't Shakespeare,
Mr. DuIaine, it's pubIic education.

431
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,243
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

432
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,337
You know who wrecked
my car, don't you?

433
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,715
Might have been
either bIack or Hispanic.

434
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,152
Let me know if you remember.

435
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,829
?? The way you sip your tea... ??

436
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,804
- Shoot me.
- What is this?

437
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,671
- ?? The memory of aII that... ??
- Man, what's that noise?

438
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,667
That noise is the work
of the great American songwriters

439
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,805
- Ira and George Gershwin.
- Who?

440
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,509
Some of the many amazing
artists you'II be dancing to.

441
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,541
Yo, man, I need the remix.

442
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,487
AII right, everyone, stand up!
Step forward.

443
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,787
?? The way you haunt
my dreams ??

444
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:36,521
?? No no, they can't take
that away from me... ??

445
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,792
AII right. Maybe I'II just give you
a chance to absorb Gershwin.

446
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:46,534
?? ...meet again
on the bumpy road to Iove ??

447
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,903
?? StiII, I'II aIways ??

448
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,001
?? AIways keep
the memory of... ??

449
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,238
He Iikes it.

450
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,839
?? The way you hoId
your knife... ??

451
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,439
Okay, can you
turn it off now?

452
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,850
Excuse me?
I am afraid I can't hear you.

453
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:06,346
?? The way you've
changed my Iife ??

454
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,452
?? No no, they can't take that
away from me ??

455
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:15,194
?? No, they can't
take that away ??

456
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,224
?? From me-- ??

457
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,471
CIassic baIIroom consists
of these dances--

458
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,772
the tango,

459
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,438
the rumba, fox-trot,

460
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,074
swing, standard waItz,

461
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,313
merengue and, of course,
the Viennese waItz.

462
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,378
These dances were danced
by the fiercest warriors.

463
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,255
Oh, the Viennese waItz?
Sounds fierce.

464
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,122
AII right, aII right,

465
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,425
how many of you think
this styIe of dance is weak?

466
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,658
Two votes for me.

467
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:51,100
Ladies and gentIemen,
you have been misIed.

468
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,367
Miss LaRhette,
wouId you do me the honor?

469
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,431
Nah, I don't think so.

470
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,272
MademoiseIIe,
pIease, come on.

471
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,210
Okay...

472
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,750
in ancient times,

473
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,691
it was beIieved
that any man

474
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,626
who couId kiII
with speed and accuracy

475
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,721
shouId be abIe to dance
with grace as weII.

476
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:22,028
BaIIroom dancing is...

477
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,831
for kings and empresses.

478
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,030
It is the dance of strength,

479
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,540
of romance and Iove.

480
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,807
- Thank you, it was IoveIy.
- Uh-huh.

481
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,840
I beIieve the appropriate answer
to that is, ''You're weIcome.''

482
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,476
Uh-huh.

483
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,282
- AII right.
- Look, son,

484
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,119
you're taIking about a bunch
of rich white foIks, sIave-hoIders.

485
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,681
I mean I've never seen
Martin Luther King--

486
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,092
You're right, you're right,
you're right. Correct.

487
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,028
- You know?
- Some were.

488
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,294
But the tango, the miIonga,
and even the rumba

489
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,597
were first danced
in some form by Africans.

490
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,000
- Oh-ho!
- Here we go.

491
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,505
Why is it that every time
you want to fIy something by us,

492
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,598
you cIaim it's got ties
to Africans,

493
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:07,270
but every time you get scared or mad,
you bIame it on African kiIIer bees?

494
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,246
- African EboIa virus.
- Right.

495
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,248
Freaking West NiIe fever.

496
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,341
AII right, aII right,
what if I toId you

497
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,784
these dances wiII
make you Iook very cooI?

498
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,152
I'd say you're fuII of shit.

499
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,386
- What is this, Mr. RockweII?
- A doctor's note.

500
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,121
I can't dance,
I got a heart condition.

501
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,221
I see... interesting man,
your doctor.

502
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,995
Not many physicians write
notes on three-hoIed paper.

503
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:32,696
- Busted.
- Partners, pIease.

504
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,040
No? AII right.

505
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,508
No, hey, okay, hey hey!

506
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,306
Now, baIIroom dancing
is about two bodies

507
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,078
moving as one.

508
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,779
I'm down with that.

509
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,846
GentIemen, pIease,
take your partner's hand.

510
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,223
HoId up, how the heII do
I know where his hands have been?

511
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,024
- Here, I'II show you, see?
- Oh, no no!

512
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,530
- Now you know.
- No. No no no.

513
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,132
That is not right.

514
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,139
- Now that's ''baII'' room.
- You are nasty!

515
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,209
WeIcome to
the fox-trot, peopIe.

516
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,415
- Step a IittIe cIoser.
- ?? I've got rhythm... ??

517
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,082
- AII right.
- ?? I've got music... ??

518
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,591
Yo, why we got to use that?

519
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,388
My grandparents don't even
Iisten to that stuff.

520
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,726
That stuff give us
the perfect fox-trot rhythm.

521
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,096
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more? ??
- Good good.

522
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,068
Now, Iadies,
start on the right foot,

523
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,662
- going backward.
- ?? I've got daisies... ??

524
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,368
Men on the Ieft,
stepping forward.

525
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,776
- Two sIow steps back.
- ?? I've got my man... ??

526
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:51,646
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more?
- Two quick ones to the side.

527
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,516
It goes Iike this-- sIow, sIow,

528
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,248
- quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? OId Man TroubIe... ??

529
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,314
- Quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? I don't mind him... ??

530
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,816
- Quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? You won't find him... ??

531
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,625
Quick, quick, good.

532
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,155
- ?? Around my door... ??
- Come on, guys, quick, quick.

533
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,634
- Stop!
- ?? I've got starIight... ??

534
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,832
Sir, sir, sorry, just Iet me
just show you, eh?

535
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,636
Everybody! PIease.

536
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,471
Why I aIways got
to demonstrate it?

537
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,409
- Because you can do it.
- ?? I've got my man... ??

538
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,209
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more? ??
- SIow, sIow,

539
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,944
quick, quick, sIow, sIow,

540
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:30,148
quick, quick, sIow, sIow,
quick, quick...

541
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,991
SIow, quick, quick--
hi, Mommy.

542
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,862
Go in back.
I'II be there in a minute.

543
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,736
- Kids eat?
- Baby had a second bottIe.

544
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,073
I fed them at Iike 6:00.

545
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,875
We'II taIk when I'm through.

546
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,349
SIow, sIow,
quick, quick, sIow...

547
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,594
?? New eyes griIIing,
your bIood's spiIIing ??

548
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,157
?? TeII me, IittIe homie,
what's the reason? ??

549
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,328
?? That can Iead
to freeway squeezing ??

550
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,338
?? What you fake it for? ??

551
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,602
?? Here we go-- one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven ??

552
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,802
- ?? Kick in the door ??
- ?? Yeah and rhyme for the Iegend ??

553
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,141
?? Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one ??

554
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:30,409
?? This is my tweIfth aIbum,
but your man's not dizz-un ??

555
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,575
- ?? What you want? ??
- ?? Defaces the coupes and the Lincs ??

556
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,108
- ?? What you get? ??
- ?? Top modeIs that Garbo in the mink ??

557
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,144
?? Whoever want it,
I take it to the brink ??

558
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,656
?? It's funny but I needed PhiIIy money,
we had a Iink, Iet's go ??

559
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,750
?? New eyes griIIing,
your bIood's spiIIing ??

560
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,023
?? TeII me, IittIe homie,
what's the reason? ??

561
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,292
?? That can Iead
to freeway squeezing ??

562
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,424
?? What you fake it for? ??

563
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,934
?? 24s kiIIin',

564
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,028
?? Move, IittIe homie,

565
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,039
?? L.L., I keep

566
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,069
- What you doing?
- Why the heII's the music off?

567
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:04,275
- Here he is-- Iife of the party.
- Dude is so whacked.

568
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,978
Here we go.

569
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,544
Du-Iame.

570
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,056
You don't have to stop.
That was amazing.

571
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,618
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

572
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:21,496
Now guys, why can't you put that emotion
and energy into my styIe of dance?

573
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,124
That's impossibIe, man.

574
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,260
ReaIIy, why so?

575
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,430
'Cause your music sucks.

576
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,940
It's corny. There ain't
no feeIing in it.

577
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,999
- No feeIing?
- Huh-uh.

578
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,601
How can you say that?

579
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,374
- Lena Horne, Joe WiIIiams,
- Who dat?

580
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,315
Nat King CoIe-- these songs are
aII about Iove.

581
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,215
Maybe you Iove different
than we do.

582
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,380
Look at you, you're aII
fIowers and things.

583
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,550
TaIk to your woman aII sweet, saying
shit trying to make her feeI nice,

584
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,423
weII, we ain't got
no time for that.

585
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,089
We want to get right down
to the iII na-na.

586
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,658
Love is universaI,
my friend.

587
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,033
We just may Iook for it
different ways,

588
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,300
hearing different songs.

589
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,398
Yeah, whatever.

590
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,509
This is what you think
about Iove, right?

591
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,380
?? Won't you fIy me
to the moon... ??

592
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:17,286
- Hmm... smooth, romantic.
- ?? And Iet me pIay among the stars... ??

593
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,188
I wouId caII that a Iove song.
I couId dance to that.

594
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,249
Dance to this.

595
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,386
?? Now shake that ass out ??

596
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,920
?? Make that cookie pop,
shake it down to the fIoor ??

597
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:29,626
?? And make that cookie drop,
shake that ass out ??

598
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:33,159
?? Make that cookie pop,
shake it down to the fIoor ??

599
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,603
?? And make
that cookie drop ??

600
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,732
What you think about that,
Mr. BaIIroom man?

601
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,402
?? She want it on the baII,
use your dirty IittIe head ??

602
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,242
?? To hustIe on the fIoor... ??

603
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,083
I didn't see you
on the fIoor today.

604
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:55,081
If you're not going to dance,
why bother even showing up?

605
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,721
If I don't go to detention,
then I can't go to cIass,

606
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,788
and then I can't graduate.

607
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,891
What d'you want
from me anyway, man?

608
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,868
I know you know who I am.

609
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,598
GIad to know you are so observant.
Now, if you'II aIIow me--

610
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,162
HoId on, man.

611
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,175
Don't be doing me no favors.

612
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,404
I don't owe nobody nothing,
I don't get down Iike that.

613
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,380
So I'm-a ask you again--
what you want from me?

614
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,509
I think a simpIe, ''Thank you for
keeping my ass out of the sIammer''

615
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,746
might be appropriate,
Mr. RockweII.

616
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,259
Nobody gives something
for nothing.

617
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,660
I'II see you in cIass--
tomorrow.

618
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,317
AII right, Iet's begin.

619
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:01,123
CaitIin, are you aII right?

620
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,617
WouId you be aII right if you were me
and you had to have a cotiIIion?

621
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,689
Don't Iie. It's Iike everyone here
is a beautifuI swan

622
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,167
and then boom,
I'm the butt-ugIy duckIing.

623
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,170
Sweetie, if you don't
want a cotiIIion,

624
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,297
why don't you just teII
your parents to caII it off?

625
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,244
I'd want one
if I couId move Iike her.

626
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,409
It's Iike sex on hardwood.

627
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,917
I wouId kiII
to dance Iike that.

628
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,218
Uh, excuse me a second.

629
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,157
Morgan?

630
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,199
?? Now run and teII your mama
and your daddy how your shit is weak ??

631
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:50,264
?? 50 deep-- damn nigga,
this ain't what you want in Iife... ??

632
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,105
I mean, the deepest
darkest parts of me,

633
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,236
Iike the bIood
through my veins and arteries,

634
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,542
- we see the fact--
- Yo.

635
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,572
?? The presidentiaI shit
is what I mean ??

636
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,676
?? Chop, chop-- yeah,
I'm back on the bIock, on the bIock ??

637
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,516
?? We've got it ready
for you straight-- ??

638
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,625
Check this out!

639
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,568
Check Mr. DuIaine,
just getting his fIirt on.

640
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,943
You can't do that.

641
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,735
Thank you, Morgan.

642
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,679
- Did you see that?
- How'd you do that?

643
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,617
That was amazing. I've never
seen anybody move Iike that.

644
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,119
I'm sure.

645
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,983
- Teach me how to do that.
- Okay.

646
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,049
AII right, aII right.

647
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,186
Listen, Iisten to me,
Iisten to me now.

648
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,695
Try to get her number.

649
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,893
How many of you men wouId Iike
to handIe a woman Iike that?

650
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,798
- Ooh.
- Two times for me.

651
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,803
Good good.
And Iadies,

652
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,466
how many of you wouId Iike the power
to drive your man to distraction?

653
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,668
Why are you showing us
what Miss Uptight couId do

654
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,008
when she got parents who give her
Iessons and the other crap she wants?

655
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,877
- That was not the point.
- Oh, it ain't?

656
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,314
No. You couId be
just as good.

657
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,511
If you work at it,
of course.

658
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,282
And for those of you who aIready
think you'II be good enough,

659
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,018
there is a citywide competition
at the end of the term.

660
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,390
Now, the winning coupIe
spIits $5,000.

661
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:58,520
HoId on, hoId on, are you
taIking ducats?

662
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,893
- Uh-huh.
- Five Gs?

663
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,397
- That's right.
- Yeah, I'm with that.

664
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,559
But I thought you said it wasn't
about the money, teach.

665
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,865
Money for dancing?
But onIy if you're good, right?

666
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,235
Yeah, onIy if you're good.

667
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,934
- Positions, pIease.
- Let's get busy.

668
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,441
- Let's review the fox-trot.
- Yo, I thought we were gonna tango.

669
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,383
Oh, no no no no,
the tango must be earned.

670
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,047
You, Mr. Ramos,
cannot handIe the tango.

671
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,113
- Yet.
- Ooh-ooh.

672
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,088
Heard you had
a heII of a cIass today.

673
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,688
I Iove the tango.

674
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,460
How do you hear
about my cIass?

675
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,468
I hope you understand
what you're doing, Pierre.

676
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,467
Yes, I understand very weII.

677
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,735
Just be carefuI
of what you're promising.

678
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,470
Everyone is entitIed
to a IittIe cuIture.

679
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,240
To me, dance is Iike Iife.

680
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,612
No, that's where you're wrong,
Mr. DuIaine.

681
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,948
Life, for these kids,
is Iike a fight to stay aIive

682
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,887
and a hustIe to make ends meet,
not baIIroom dancing.

683
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,672
AII right, Iadies and gentIemen,
thank you very much.

684
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,697
See you on Thursday, okay?

685
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,936
Thank you.

686
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,467
We need to taIk scheduIe
and financing--

687
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,104
- Mr. DuIaine.
- Yeah?

688
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,944
Morgan said the kids you teach uptown
are a bunch of no-taIent Iosers.

689
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,475
Ah, you can't aIways beIieve
what Morgan says.

690
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,283
I'd reaIIy Iike
to join them.

691
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,223
?? FaII back, get down,
Iay down ??

692
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,226
?? Sit down, stay down,
head round ??

693
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,457
?? Hey now-- does a nigga
wanna get a IittIe off his mind? ??

694
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,989
?? I'm a nigga
that'II hit a nigga off his time ??

695
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,433
?? Brains in the air,
fIame to the hair ??

696
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,267
?? 'Cause the game ain't fair,
and I'II take it there ??

697
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,738
?? With the right one, baby ??

698
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,401
?? Got that?
We tryin' to Iight one, baby ??

699
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,671
?? I run shit here... ??

700
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,303
What the heII
are you Iooking at?

701
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,644
?? I run shit here... ??

702
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,706
- ?? If you wanna see me prove it... ??
- What?

703
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,741
- She was staring at me.
- ?? Watch how quick a nigga Iose it ??

704
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,946
?? Make you get aII my shit
and have you fearing for your Iife... ??

705
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,980
- The furnace is whacked.
- AII right.

706
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:11,461
CIass, this is,
uh, CaitIin Spencer.

707
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,985
She'II be joining us
for the day.

708
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,362
Yo, thought we saw
the Iast of your visitors.

709
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,959
WeII, CaitIin is... different.

710
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,266
Think of her as
a foreign exchange student.

711
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,205
HoId on, where did
the equipment come from?

712
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,969
- Oh...
- Didn't you--

713
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,533
Yeah, I bought it
from a friend.

714
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,545
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. You're trying to teII me

715
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,376
you actuaIIy bought
aII this for detention?

716
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,780
No, weII...

717
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,119
- Yeah, it's aII good.
- I got it for Christmas.

718
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:40,623
We'II pretend I beIieve you.

719
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:44,389
Now, put on something
I can work with, pIease.

720
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:47,625
And guess what?
Positions, pIease.

721
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,724
AII right, here we go.

722
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,493
AII right.

723
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,700
Eyes over here,
eyes over here.

724
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,640
Today, we rumba.

725
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,076
And... quick, quick, sIow.

726
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,102
Quick, quick, sIow.

727
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,274
That's the basic rumba.

728
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,046
Eddie... Eddie!

729
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,780
Dance with CaitIin
so I can show you.

730
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:13,051
Oh, man, no, heII no,
I'm not dancing with her.

731
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,025
Look, I know I'm not the best dancer
in the worId or anything,

732
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,426
but your girI right here
is just pitifuI.

733
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,089
Yeah a-a-and another thing--

734
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,190
we don't need any more
white-bread tourists

735
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,258
seeing how the other haIf Iives.
We don't.

736
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:29,534
White bread? I'm sorry,
do you own a mirror?

737
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,806
AII right, Ramos,

738
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,040
you dance with CaitIin.

739
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,784
I'm so fIy I can make
anyone Iook good.

740
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,190
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh-huh.

741
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,598
AII right.
Attention and...

742
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,226
quick, quick, sIow.

743
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,758
Quick, quick, sIow.

744
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,930
Quick, quick, sIow.

745
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,406
- Quick, quick, sIow.
- How are you doing?

746
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,204
Quick, quick, sIow.

747
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,972
- Quick, quick, sIow.
- You Iike this?

748
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,929
Nice jump.

749
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,954
You couId have used that
in cIass today.

750
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,236
Rock!

751
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,934
Just a second.

752
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:41,376
The night you destroyed
Augustine's car...

753
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:44,904
- why did you do it?
- Because it feIt good.

754
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,178
That's aII?

755
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,447
Why are you
in my business, man?

756
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,819
It's hard to Iose someone
you Iove. It hurts.

757
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,622
It's easy to think that something in the
street can fiII the bad feeIing inside,

758
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,821
but you know what?
It won't.

759
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,693
You need to stop acting
Iike you know my Iife.

760
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,097
Stop assuming I was
taIking about your Iife.

761
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:07,532
What are you doing here?

762
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,630
Not everyone has
uIterior motives.

763
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,141
In my worId they do.

764
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:15,304
And if our worIds ain't that far apart,
you wouId understand that.

765
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,643
You come around here
with your fancy suits on,

766
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,445
your sIick IittIe dance moves, you think
you're better than us, don't you?

767
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:23,078
- No no, you don't know who I am.
- Oh, I don't know anything, huh?

768
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,884
You can know about me,
but I can't know anything about you?

769
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,423
I got work.

770
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,279
You're Iate again,
RockweII.

771
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,152
Yeah, I know, I've been getting
caught up with some stuff at schooI.

772
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,951
I-it's not going
to happen again though.

773
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,821
Damn right it won't.

774
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,172
Let me take this opportunity to thank
aII of you for being with us.

775
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,547
Good Iuck with the decisions
that you make now.

776
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,348
You know, why do you stay
with someone who cheated on you?

777
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,116
It seems to make no sense
and yet...

778
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,851
How come you're here?

779
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,383
- I got fired, Ma.
- What did you do?

780
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,190
Where's the food at?

781
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,891
- I gave you money for food, Ma.
- Now you know I tried, Jay.

782
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,298
- I try, I can't do it aII--
- Come on, I don't want to hear that.

783
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,394
- I can't do it myseIf--
- Hey-hey. What's with aII the yeIIing?

784
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,769
- I'm hungry, Pop!
- You, Iower your voice.

785
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,799
Where's the food at?
And why am I busting my ass aII day

786
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,936
whiIe you in here
drinking on yours?

787
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,843
- You know I'm sick.
- I know you're drunk.

788
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,713
You've been Iike that ever since
Ray died. That ain't no excuse.

789
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,651
PeopIe out there sicker than you
stiII supporting their famiIies.

790
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,052
...You have in a sense
the same sickness...

791
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,061
You know what?
You ain't even worth it.

792
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,086
That's why I'm busting my ass
at schooI every day

793
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,928
to make sure I'm
nothing Iike you.

794
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,299
If that's the reason you're not Ieaving
the person who's cheating on you,

795
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,531
then for your own sake,
you shouId seek heIp.

796
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:25,008
If you don't, then you're cheating.
You're cheating yourseIf.

797
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,941
You get out of this house.

798
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,743
Get out!

799
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,912
Yo, G!

800
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,687
Whassup, man?

801
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,250
Say-- you wanna ride?

802
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,819
Yeah.

803
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,841
?? See, I know
you Iike my swagger ??

804
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:10,081
?? Oh, you know I'm strapped
when I come through ??

805
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,021
?? Chain hanging
Iike AIi Baba, oh ??

806
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,581
?? Know me,
you know how I do ??

807
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,423
?? The way that I move ??

808
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,362
?? You're never gonna get it,
'cause I'm too smooth ??

809
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,264
?? You're never gonna get it,
I thought you knew ??

810
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,326
?? You're never gonna get it,
'cause you ain't got a cIue ??

811
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,668
?? You're never gonna get it,
get it, get it. ??

812
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,100
Thank you very much,
ma'am.

813
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,506
?? I wanna spaz out,
throw a brick ??

814
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,570
?? Sucker-ass, Iiquored gIass
house in the suburbs ??

815
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,101
?? I know the time comin'
chiId support gonna bust in ??

816
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,910
?? To try to find

817
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,110
- ?? I know your mama don't understand ??

818
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,381
?? I ain't getting busy dissin' events,
but she knows... ??

819
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,047
I'm here for dance cIass.

820
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,454
Oh, you think
you're one of us now?

821
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,321
- No.
- Oh, you want to go back downtown

822
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,192
and teII your IittIe rich-ass friends
what it's Iike to sIum with us?

823
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,857
- No.
- Then what?

824
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,699
Look...

825
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,035
I want to be here...

826
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,565
not because I'm sIumming,

827
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,602
but because I feeI better
up here than I do where I Iive.

828
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,386
So what you got
in the suitcase?

829
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,219
?? Stop, mami, work that ass out
and get it on the fIoor... ??

830
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,350
?? I spit fire
tiII the day that I die-a-- ??

831
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,623
Gimme that mike, dude.
What are you doing, man?

832
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,254
- I'm fIowin'.
- You can't rap.

833
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,822
?? Hey, Iemme hear you say
I Iike that, yeah... ??

834
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,596
- What happened to George and Ira?
- Hey, they retired, man.

835
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,364
Demo time!

836
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,736
?? Lemme hear you say--
I Iike that, yeah ??

837
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,434
- ?? What ya think about it? ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

838
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,999
?? Yeah, what ya think
about it? ??

839
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,772
You're Iooking
a IittIe confused.

840
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,008
It's simpIe reaIIy. We scratched
two different joints together.

841
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,915
But the underbeIIy
of the beats are aII the same.

842
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,215
- See, watch.
- ?? Yeah, what you think about it? ??

843
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,414
Yeah, it's the bottom beat
that I'm dancing to now.

844
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,252
But I can
change it up though.

845
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,282
- Yo, E! FIip it.
- ?? ...Rose goId sit on my wrist ??

846
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,795
?? Dash, no, you and your --,
you better stop ????

847
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,263
???? I Iike it when the music come on
so we can just rock Iike this ??

848
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,357
- ?? Yeah ??
- ?? I Iike... ??

849
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,631
?? I Iike it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move Iike this-- ????

850
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,796
I mean, it's simpIe.
You can take out the underbeIIy

851
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,203
and dance to the top
of the beat,

852
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,175
or you can take out the top
and dance to the underbeIIy.

853
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,302
It's crazy, right?
It's tight.

854
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,245
Yes. Yes...

855
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,477
???? If I ain't in the cIub,
I'm on the streets... ??

856
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:54,814
two songs...

857
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,217
- working together?
- Yeah.

858
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,346
?? I Iike that... ??

859
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,414
This is a beautifuI
idea, yeah.

860
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,392
Yeah, it is.

861
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,191
Which means,
we couId use, Iet's say...

862
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,958
your music with...

863
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:11,365
- my music and then back to your music.
- Wha-aat?

864
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,062
Let me try something.

865
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,571
Uh, this one.

866
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,573
- AII right, see if this works.
- A'ight.

867
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,666
- Number four.
- This better be something new.

868
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,039
?? The way you wear your hat... ??

869
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:31,020
Now these are the basic
beats for saIsa, right?

870
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,578
Good good,

871
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,022
now I want you to faII in
and count with me.

872
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:39,256
- ?? No, they can't take that away... ????
- UnderbeIIy of the rhythm onIy.

873
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:42,197
AII right? Good.
Now, partner it up.

874
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,597
Yeah yeah, come on.

875
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,167
?? Your boy's crazy, man... ??

876
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,503
Eyes off of the fIoor.

877
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,974
Your souI is not
in your feet, aII right?

878
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,511
- ?? Lemme hear you say it-- ??
- ?? The way you wear your hat ??

879
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,742
?? Wonder-- wonder--
wonder what's the winning ??

880
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,944
?? Homie, you'II aIways
be a runner-up... ??

881
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,953
Monster, you're too big.

882
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,421
Every move you make,
it's Iike the Rocky Mountains.

883
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,220
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Pierre, I need another partner.

884
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,558
- AII right and--
- ?? They can't take that away... ??

885
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,698
Wanna dance with me?

886
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,132
Better not. Didn't you see
what just happened?

887
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,136
They caII me Monster
for a reason.

888
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,297
I'm just not made
to dance.

889
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,570
- Monster, do you Iike dancing?
- Yeah, I guess so.

890
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,737
Then you were made
to dance.

891
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,803
???? I Iike that ??

892
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,838
?? I Iike when the music

893
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,147
- ?? So we can just rock Iike this ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

894
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,018
?? I Iike it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move Iike this ??

895
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:41,114
- ?? I Iike that... ????
- Whoa!

896
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,183
What is the name
of that move you just did?

897
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:45,751
It ain't got no name. What you're
Iooking at is history in the making.

898
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:48,628
- Good, just do it.
- ???? FoIIow the Ieader ??

899
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,725
?? Rose goId sit on my neck,
rose goId sit on my wrist ??

900
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,430
?? You and your --,
you better stop ??

901
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,598
Guys...

902
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,006
why don't you try
just to dance together?

903
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:02,671
You know, try.
Come on.

904
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,714
???? FoIIow me into a soIo ??

905
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,984
?? Get in the fIow
and you can pitch it Iike a photo ??

906
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,184
?? Music makes meIIow, maintains
to make meIodies for M.C.s ??

907
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,022
?? Motivates the breaks ??

908
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,153
?? I'm everIasting,
I can go on for days and days ??

909
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,255
?? With rhyme dispIays that engrave,
deep as x-rays ??

910
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,129
?? I can take a phrase
that's rareIy heard ??

911
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,293
?? FIip it,
now it's a daiIy word... ????

912
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,428
AII right, waIk forward.

913
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,461
Everyone and...

914
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,497
???? Let me hear you say,
now you know what I'm 'bout ??

915
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,839
?? Come on, Iet's go,
whatcha think about it? ??

916
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,404
?? I Iike that,
I Iike it, I Iike it ??

917
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,814
?? Let me hear
you say, yeah ??

918
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,284
- ?? Whatcha think about it? ??

919
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,515

920
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,614
?? Come on. ??

921
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,989
- See ya Iater, bIack.
- AII right, man.

922
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,102
The pIace is aIways
a mess around here.

923
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,975
You never Iisten
to me no more.

924
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,773
Is that too much to ask?

925
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,872
Get your oId Iazy ass up away from that
TV and do something around here.

926
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,628
I thought Santy CIaus was
supposed to foot the biII for the tree.

927
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,395
He does ordinariIy,
but this year we're doing it for him.

928
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,631
You just try and think of yourseIf
as one of Santa's IittIe heIpers.

929
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,301
Who is it?

930
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,074
It's WoodIey.
You know, your mama's friend.

931
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,241
My mom's not home yet.

932
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,945
Yeah, I know,
she toId me to wait.

933
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,948
A'ight.

934
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,857
Take a seat
if you can find one.

935
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,692
There's a branch on the right
side that spoiIs the shape.

936
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,096
- Which one?
- This one right up here.

937
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,500
Fred, wouId you go down in the basement,
get your saw and cut that off for me?

938
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,697
It's a IittIe unbaIanced.

939
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,229
Oh, now, honey, maybe we can
hang something there.

940
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,209
He don't have to go aII the way down
to the basement to get a saw.

941
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,576
Look, honey, the tree has
to be baIanced, you know that.

942
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,740
We can't have
one branch out Iike--

943
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,917
I ain't gonna ask you where
you're getting this money from.

944
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,688
It's none of your business.

945
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,690
My mom said
she was coming.

946
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,100
- What, you want a soda or something?
- Huh-uh.

947
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,699
Just teII me something.
Where do you sIeep?

948
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:50,179
Right here.
The kids share the bedroom.

949
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,205
You wanna
make some money?

950
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,984
Come on, you know
what I'm taIking about.

951
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,320
You're your mama's
daughter, ain't you?

952
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,962
Whatever you've got with my mom has
to wait tiII she get home, aII right?

953
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,992
Come on, mister.

954
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,002
I didn't mean no harm by it.

955
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:15,436
Yeah, whatever.

956
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,370
Nasty--

957
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,070
Listen, I offered to pay you.

958
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,136
- Get out! Get out!
- I shouId just take it from you.

959
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,272
What you're gonna do, girI?
What you're gonna do?

960
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,374
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Hey!

961
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,284
- Mommy!
- What's going on here?

962
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:32,273
?? When I was just
a IittIe girI ??

963
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:35,341
?? I asked my mother ??

964
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:38,252

?? Here's what

00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:55,031
?? Que sera, sera ??

?? The future's not ours ??

973

?? To see ??

974
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:23,229
?? WeII, weII, weII, weII ??

975
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,200
?? Come ??

976
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,965
?? Que sera ??

977
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,734
?? Que sera... ??

978
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,138
What the heII
are you doing here?

979
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,840
I couId ask you the same thing,
but I couId aIready see.

980
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:41,009
?? When I grew up
and feII in Iove-- ??

981
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,950
You know what?
Leave it on, I'm gonna go.

982
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,978
But you didn't answer my question--
what are you doing here?

983
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:47,785
Oh.

984
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:51,191
WeII, I was down the haII, you know,
practicing my fox-trot

985
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,195
and then I heard your music,
so I figured--

986
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,890
Go to heII!

987
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,764
You wanna know why I'm here?
'Cause I can't go home.

988
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,706
My pop's been drunk
ever since your punkass brother

989
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,676
- and his friends roIIed up on Ray.
- Don't taIk about my brother!

990
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,803
He was sick to begin with, then your
dumbass brother had to do some--

991
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,939
- I said, don't taIk about my brother!
- He was a crack deaIer.

992
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,381
He onIy deaIt to bring food
into our house.

993
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,112
- Ever since my daddy--
- ''Daddy''?!

994
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,847
How do you even know
who your daddy is?

995
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,822
- Everybody know your mom is a ho.
- Don't taIk about my mama!

996
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,791
HoId it.
What's going on?

997
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,816
Step away from her.

998
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:33,468
HeIIo?

999
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,095
What?

1000
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,699
You couId have warned me you toId
them I was your father, I mean...

1001
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:42,268
Don't trip, nobody cares about who
your reaI pops is around here anyway.

1002
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,337
ObviousIy not.
Where I come from,

1003
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,872
when a person gets woken up in the
middIe of the night, they get answers.

1004
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,475
So what you want to know?

1005
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,851
Let's start with...

1006
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,185
why caII me?

1007
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,458
You're the onIy one I couId think of
who might come down and get me.

1008
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,725
Need I ask you why you were
Iiving in the boiIer room?

1009
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:07,703
Man, if she never came down there,
everything wouId have been cooI.

1010
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:10,205
UnbeIievabIe.
You know...

1011
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,174
maybe you two have more things
in common than you think you do.

1012
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,643
My son, come on.

1013
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,746
Hey, man, it's just
for the night, you know,

1014
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,223
so don't think I'm gonna come
to your cIass or anything.

1015
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,192
An-and we ain't kicking it.
We ain't friends.

1016
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,627
I got it.

1017
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,063
And maybe I snore a IittIe,
I don't know...

1018
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,068
Oh, that's okay,
'cause I know I snore.

1019
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,080
It's a nice pIace
you've got here.

1020
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:54,447
I'm gonna have me a spot
Iike this someday...

1021
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,543
somepIace cIean.

1022
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:00,579
You can get
whatever you want, Rock.

1023
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,389
No, onIy some peopIe get
the shit they want.

1024
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:07,191
That's true.

1025
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,222
And those are the peopIe
who show up to get it.

1026
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,632
Anybody ever teII you
you taIk too much?

1027
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,766
Yeah...

1028
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,969
they did.

1029
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,638
Good night.

1030
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,420
- That's not the point.
- No, the point is they need heIp,

1031
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,056
not suspension from schooI.

1032
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,932
Oh, reaIIy, pIease teII me,
Professor DuIaine,

1033
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,402

1034
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:52,966
So, as your principaI has

1036
01:01:55,411 --> 01:01:57,208
- for a private session.
- What?!

1037
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:00,511
Whatever probIems you have with each
other, you can work out as partners.
