1
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:24,926
Federal agent,
search warrant--

2
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,282
you're all under arrest.

3
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:34,936
OK, it's all clear.

4
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,150
You guys see
anything over there?

5
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,541
All clear over here.

6
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:46,058
OK, let's go!

7
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:47,379
[gun shots]

8
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:49,186
[inaudible] down!
We're engaged!

9
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,229
We're engaged!

10
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,494
[gun shots]

11
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,929
Get the hell outta here.

12
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,015
[gun shots]

13
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,819
Cover me!

14
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,904
[grunting]

15
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,577
Get Anderson outta here!

16
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,620
I got these guys.

17
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,842
[gun shots]

18
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,344
Call for back-up!

19
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:36,560
Get outta here!

20
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:37,524
What do you think, Eddie?

21
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,497
He's in there.

22
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:39,471
I can smell him.

23
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:40,722
Good.

24
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:42,043
Let's pull back and wait
for the rest of the team.

25
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:43,398
Come on.

26
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:44,371
Ah, you wait to negotiate
with this asshole,

27
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,379
we'll be here all month.

28
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,492
That's an order, Eddie.

29
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,106
You stand down.
Eddie!

30
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,393
I'm going in.

31
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,504
Son of a bitch!

32
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:45,335
He's in!

33
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,273
Let's go.

34
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:15,504
[gun shots]

35
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,760
[clicking]

36
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:34,864
He slipped the hook.

37
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,408
- Give me your weapons, Eddie.
- Relax, John.

38
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,632
Hand over your
weapons, or I'll

39
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:54,953
have these men
take them from you.

40
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,981
[alarm]

41
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,335
Thank you, Eddie.

42
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:36,835
Thank you for that.

43
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,511
Oh, shit.

44
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,290
Senator Douglas Wilson
shown here with media

45
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,070
advisor Valerie Miller--

46
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:25,321
my hair looks like shit.

47
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:32,933
I didn't have a chance to thank
you for that wake up call.

48
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:36,270
Don't mention it.

49
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,181
I don't have to be
up this early, Eddie.

50
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,234
I am not going to sit
around today watching

51
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,555
you feel sorry for yourself.

52
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,996
I've got a lot to do
before the train leaves.

53
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,255
Did you talk to that attorney?

54
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,619
Yep, I talked to him.

55
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,356
He said he feels the
agency has a pretty

56
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,129
strong case against me.

57
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,832
He also thinks Gathers
is just trying to get

58
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,361
me out of his field unit.

59
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:07,725
He says, if I take a
desk job, he thinks

60
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:08,942
he'll take me off suspension.

61
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,331
I told him he may
as well shoot me.

62
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:17,492
How much longer you want
to keep playing cowboy?

63
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,091
Until I see
Anderson in custody.

64
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,659
Thing's like a cancer, Eddie,
eating you from the inside.

65
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:27,745
Why don't you just let it go?

66
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:28,857
Because I can't.

67
00:10:31,707 --> 00:10:34,105
You sure you don't want
to go on this trip with me?

68
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,921
It'd be a good chance
for us to get away.

69
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,380
No, thanks.

70
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,840
Sitting on a train watching
you play spin control

71
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,960
for the senator's pet
projects is not exactly

72
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:43,385
my idea of having a good time.

73
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,984
That's not what this
trip's about, Eddie.

74
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:45,923
It's not what I'm about.

75
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:51,309
[door slams]

76
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:59,339
You see, Americans
do have rights.

77
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:03,371
We have the right to live
and work in our homes,

78
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:05,212
in our businesses,
in our schools

79
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,854
without the fear of
being shot to death.

80
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,392
Americans are tired
of being terrorized,

81
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:13,311
tired of living with
death in our streets,

82
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,805
and our cities, and our towns.

83
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,143
And yes, we will get the
guns out of the streets.

84
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:26,727
REPORTER (ON TV):
Senator, we're all

85
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:28,500
aware of the tragic deaths
of your wife and son

86
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,855
at the hands of street gangs.

87
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,906
Was this an important
factor in your decision

88
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,756
to sponsor the bill?

89
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,336
My wife and son
were volunteering

90
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:41,325
at a East LA clinic the
night they were murdered.

91
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:46,260
For months, they had worked
there trying to save lives.

92
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,319
And they often spoke
of the innocent victims

93
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:53,872
dead from gunshot wounds,
dead from drive-by shootings.

94
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:56,201
REPORTER (ON TV): Doesn't this
make a convenient selling point

95
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:59,085
for your bill?

96
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,268
[inaudible]

97
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:06,176
Convenient-- there's nothing
convenient about kneeling next

98
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,200
to the bodies of
your wife and child,

99
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:12,884
helpless while their life
blood spills into the streets.

100
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,935
And it was apathy like
that that murdered

101
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,229
them as sure as the bullets.

102
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,446
That'll be all for today.

103
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:27,170
Before we discuss our
mission, there is another matter

104
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:30,367
that must be dealt with.

105
00:12:30,472 --> 00:12:33,773
The ATF came dangerously
close to our mission

106
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,658
three months ago.

107
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:42,393
It was with a last minute
intervention by one of you

108
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:46,007
that I was able to escape.

109
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:50,005
Still, one of you gave me away.

110
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:55,115
Now, gentlemen, ours is a
brotherhood of vengeance.

111
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:59,528
And we shall remain true,
or we all shall perish.

112
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,287
Now, I have done a little
investigation of my own,

113
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:10,442
and I have found our Judas.

114
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:16,003
[gun shots]

115
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:28,098
Carl, do we have the
senator's security?

116
00:13:28,203 --> 00:13:30,357
Fortunately, the senator
continues to refuse

117
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:32,478
Secret Service protection.

118
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:35,571
His staff has employed
a private firm.

119
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,205
They've assigned one
man to the train.

120
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:41,167
By the time the train leaves the
station, that man will be me.

121
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:42,245
Excellent.

122
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,260
Luke, do we have a
layout of the train?

123
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,250
We sure as shittin' do.

124
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:51,003
I've got to thank my old boss
at West Rail, Mr. Matthew Clark

125
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,679
Meyer, for supplying
us with his layout,

126
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:56,669
direct from central
computer, too.

127
00:13:56,773 --> 00:13:58,928
Now, the senator's
car is at the end.

128
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,561
Now, it used to be
called a caboose,

129
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,717
but-- you know, politicians
should be in cabooses,

130
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,628
don't you think?
I don't know.

131
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:06,157
Here's a diner.

132
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:09,147
Then we got the press car,
the baggage, and the engine.

133
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,719
Now, the guard's gonna be
posted between the senator's

134
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:13,144
car and the diner.

135
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:14,881
But, of course, that
guard's gonna be designated

136
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,515
[inaudible] here by Carl.

137
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:19,434
Can we control the rail
system from the control room?

138
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,006
Well, now that would
be the expertise of Mr.

139
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,605
Harold Howard over there.

140
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,065
Mm-hm.

141
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,341
Yeah, we're gonna-- we're gonna
sneak into his train's computer

142
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:32,191
and steal some codes.

143
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:35,631
And that allows us to access
West Rail's mainframe.

144
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,473
We're gonna up-link
via satellite.

145
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:42,061
And, at that point,
our little train goes

146
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,939
dark on all their computers.

147
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,432
Presto.

148
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:49,256
Clear sailing from then on,
all the way to the target.

149
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,028
DAVID ANDERSON: Jack, the bomb--

150
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:53,218
Ah, yes, the bomb--

151
00:14:53,323 --> 00:14:54,852
good.

152
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,771
We got an adjustable timer on
the detonator, big fucking bang

153
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:58,919
any time you want it, Dave.

154
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:04,966
Oh, did I forgot to
mention it's a nuke?

155
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,129
Lots of radiation,
so watch your balls.

156
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,797
That means you, Luke.

157
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,952
I'll try to keep
an eye out for 'em.

158
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:18,765
Looking great, thanks.

159
00:15:24,186 --> 00:15:25,890
What do you have on
the elusive Mr. Anderson?

160
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:28,287
Uh, West Virginia
lead didn't play out.

161
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,782
Start from scratch?

162
00:15:29,886 --> 00:15:31,103
What about our informant?

163
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:32,841
Called from Lancaster
about a week ago,

164
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:35,865
but haven't heard
a thing since then.

165
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,341
You know, uh, Lyman seems
to think that Anderson's

166
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,800
still in California.

167
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,607
Lyman is on indefinite
suspension pending Internal

168
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,346
Affairs review, and
you'll be next if you

169
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,284
don't stop talking to him.

170
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,957
I'm sorry, Frank.

171
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:53,418
Your father would have
kicked my butt if I'd

172
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:56,510
have talked to him like that.

173
00:15:56,615 --> 00:16:00,125
The thing is, Lyman is
probably right about Anderson.

174
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,516
So why don't you
give him a call?

175
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:31,094
[phone ringing]

176
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:36,828
Lyman--

177
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:39,505
Eddie, it's John Gathers.

178
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,312
Kiss my ass.

179
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,084
Eddie, we need to talk.

180
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,197
It's important.

181
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,587
You can talk to my lawyer.

182
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:53,790
I'm going on vacation.

183
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:54,972
Eddie!

184
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:55,945
Eddie!

185
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,335
[beep]

186
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:02,619
Any other ideas?

187
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,937
I don't know what's
keeping the security man.

188
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,779
His firm is well aware
of our departure time.

189
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,247
I don't give a rat's
ass what his excuse is.

190
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,506
Listen, security is
critical on this trip.

191
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,974
And, with this bill,
we got every gun freak

192
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:40,329
in America on us.

193
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,415
If your private cop isn't
here in the next 15 minutes,

194
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,353
I'm gonna--

195
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:44,640
Give it a rest, Thomas.

196
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:46,273
Listen, I'm sure he's
stuck in traffic.

197
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:47,732
Besides, I don't know why the
security is necessary, anyway.

198
00:17:47,837 --> 00:17:48,984
I'm not the president.

199
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,939
Not yet you're not,
senator-- not yet.

200
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,302
Ah, the press.

201
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,379
Senator--

202
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,534
Jennifer Benton,
star network anchor--

203
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,724
what brings you out
from behind your desk?

204
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,767
Sweeps.

205
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,130
She's doing a
series on your bill.

206
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:06,432
Ah, and who's this?

207
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:09,178
This is my daughter Melinda.

208
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:10,325
What?

209
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,410
JENNIFER BENTON: Say
hello to the senator.

210
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:14,009
Hello.

211
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:14,912
Hi.

212
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:16,929
Future leaders
of our country--

213
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:18,458
she's studying journalism
in high school.

214
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:22,872
Ah, following in her
mother's lovely footsteps.

215
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,193
Uh, actually no.

216
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,660
I'm just trying to help
her pass her course.

217
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,885
Uh, this is my
shooter, Steve Baker.

218
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,241
Pleasure, Senator,
how are you?

219
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:31,179
Steve, how are you doing?

220
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:32,430
STEVE: Good, thanks.

221
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,307
Roger Tate, World Syndicate--

222
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:37,192
Mr. Tate, I have
your book on Vietnam.

223
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,555
It reads like you were there.

224
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:40,980
I was.

225
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:44,212
So was I. Well, I'll
see you all on the train.

226
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,402
You know, it's great
having a friendly face,

227
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:48,627
even if it is the press.

228
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:50,226
Well, I'm not always working.

229
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,929
But the senator is.

230
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,431
We must say our goodbyes.

231
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:56,829
Thomas, sometime
you have the charm

232
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,915
and wit of a small rodent.

233
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,174
I gotta wait for security.

234
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,282
[toilet flushing]

235
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,872
[grunting]

236
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:57,306
[glass breaking]

237
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:27,858
[door opening]

238
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:35,852
Where do you guys want to sit?

239
00:20:35,956 --> 00:20:36,929
Uh, this is good.

240
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,320
OK, I'll sit back here.

241
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:39,293
All right.

242
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,865
Say, where's the
bar on this rig?

243
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:55,663
Just up ahead.

244
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:56,776
It's not open yet.

245
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:06,717
Hey, can I have one of those?

246
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,072
You sure can.

247
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:11,234
Uh, sir-- sir, she's a minor.

248
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,494
And you're violating
Rail policy.

249
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,058
Thank you.

250
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:17,178
Put it out.

251
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:18,151
What?

252
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:19,090
Put it out, Harold.

253
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,236
You're being rude.

254
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,131
Miss Miller?

255
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,487
- Yes.
- Security.

256
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,321
Oh, great.

257
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:36,677
We've been waiting for you.

258
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:37,998
Sorry I was late-- a
little trouble there.

259
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:39,145
That's OK.

260
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:40,292
Let's get you to
the senator's car.

261
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:41,091
I'll fill you in
on what to expect.

262
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,099
You bet, yeah.

263
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:49,363
Give me go.

264
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:50,371
I'm ready to roll, Captain.

265
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:00,937
Gentlemen--

266
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,467
Well, it's about time.

267
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,386
This is Carl Howard, our
security man for the trip.

268
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,472
Ah, pleased to
meet your, Carl.

269
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,827
It's an honor
to meet you, sir.

270
00:22:08,931 --> 00:22:10,565
You're welcome to use
any of the facilities

271
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,303
as long as the senator
isn't in conference.

272
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:15,952
Wrong-- I want him outside
of the car at all times.

273
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:18,942
We are not paying him to
drink the free whiskey.

274
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,783
I'm sorry, Mr. Howard--

275
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,285
Thomas Grady, our
chief of staff.

276
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:25,615
A most unpleasant man
when he wants to be.

277
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,944
If it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer to stand outside.

278
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:28,917
Sure.

279
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,354
Evening, everyone--

280
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,571
Senator.

281
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:39,031
My name's Dave.

282
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:40,456
I'm your conductor.
- Pleased to meet you, Dave--

283
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,394
Valerie Miller.

284
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:42,888
Nice to meet you.

285
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,800
Just making sure everything's
nice and cozy in here.

286
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,434
If you need anything, just yell.

287
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:48,936
You can be certain
that we will, Dave.

288
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:49,909
Cheers.

289
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:18,654
Cutting it pretty close, huh?

290
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:21,260
Oh, yeah, it's
rush hour out there.

291
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,484
So what outfit are you at?

292
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,875
Outfit?

293
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,586
Newspaper, press Syndicate

294
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:28,837
Oh-- oh, I'm--

295
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,367
I'm not with anybody.

296
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,556
I just got a friend riding
back there with the senator.

297
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,495
Female friend?

298
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:36,935
Oh, yeah.

299
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,466
Yeah, she's female.

300
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,403
I hope.

301
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:45,937
Those are probably radio guys.

302
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:48,093
They've been in the sound
booth a little too long.

303
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,817
7 o'clock--

304
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,033
Throttle up!

305
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:44,816
You find him?

306
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,172
Yeah, the house is locked up.

307
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,535
Lights are on,
but nobody's home.

308
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,655
Sounds like me about now.

309
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,845
Lyman picked a hell of a
time to go on vacation.

310
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,756
Lancaster Police found
the body of our informant

311
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,737
in the desert near
a roadside bar.

312
00:24:56,842 --> 00:24:59,483
So Lyman was right,
Anderson is in California.

313
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:02,091
I wish Lyman was here
to say "I told you so."

314
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:03,794
Have the local law
boys put out an APB

315
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:07,512
on Anderson's description,
aliases, and so on.

316
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:09,946
Think it'll help?

317
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,161
You get a better idea?

318
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:14,290
No, but I'll bet Lyman does.

319
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:16,480
Well, you'd win the
lottery on those odds.

320
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:26,559
More coffee, sir?

321
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:28,783
Um, no, thanks.

322
00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:35,213
No, start with the lead.

323
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:37,577
A good story needs a lead
line that will grab them.

324
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:38,516
I know.

325
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,536
How do I get back
to the senator's car.

326
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:46,961
Well, you can't--

327
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,395
no access til morning.

328
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:51,272
They got a security
guard back there

329
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:52,801
that's not letting anyone in.

330
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:55,373
I think the senator is
prepping his speeches.

331
00:25:55,477 --> 00:25:57,215
Oh.

332
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,335
You know, if you got a
word into the conductor,

333
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,143
maybe he can get a
message back to them.

334
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:02,498
No, that's all right.

335
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,305
I-- I want to surprise
her, but I don't want

336
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,078
to disturb her work, you know?

337
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,642
Well, suit yourself.

338
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,748
Straw poll says here that the
majority of the American public

339
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:19,668
agrees with the gun bill.

340
00:26:19,772 --> 00:26:20,919
Great, now all we
have to do is get

341
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:23,248
them to call their congressmen.

342
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:25,472
But we can't get half
this country to vote.

343
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:27,245
Less than half-- the
last election turnout

344
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:29,678
was a fraction under 47%.

345
00:26:29,782 --> 00:26:30,547
Exactly.

346
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:32,945
So, we bring out the big guns.

347
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,856
Nice choice of words, Thomas.

348
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,429
What big guns?

349
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,131
Personal tragedy.

350
00:26:39,236 --> 00:26:40,279
No.

351
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:43,580
Look, Senator, every
American in this country

352
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:47,508
can identify with the image of
a man cradling his dead wife

353
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:49,420
and his son in his arms.

354
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,053
It makes 'em cry.

355
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:54,147
And it makes 'em
very, very angry.

356
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,058
I ask you politely to drop it.

357
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:57,275
It gets votes!

358
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,221
Yes, and I have to
live with the pain

359
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,924
like a knife in my gut!

360
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:02,767
If you think I'm going to
take my personal tragedy

361
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,922
and lay it out there in front of
the American public, just to--

362
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,485
This is hardball, Senator.

363
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,293
You want to get
this bill passed?

364
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:09,857
You want to save lives?

365
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,351
So do it!

366
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:15,175
You must do anything it takes
to get this bill passed.

367
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,634
Anything but that.

368
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,469
Ugh!

369
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:19,693
Wait a minute, both of you.

370
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:21,118
Thomas has a point.

371
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,933
The poll numbers don't mean
anything if people don't vote.

372
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:25,776
Ah, thank you very much.

373
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,618
Now, it makes me sick,
but it's the truth.

374
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:29,251
The American people
have to be beaten,

375
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:32,657
blackmailed, or kicked in the
ass before they'll do anything.

376
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:35,160
Thomas, give me a light.

377
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:37,106
So we're just going
to have to figure

378
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,705
out how to shake things up.

379
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:43,919
[sigh]

380
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,776
- Hey, Luke.
- [inaudible]

381
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,819
Cover me, will you?

382
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:02,861
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

383
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,356
You want some?

384
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,163
Coffee?

385
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:10,160
No, I'm trying to cut
down on that, really.

386
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:12,420
[grunting]

387
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:31,813
[bone cracks]

388
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:42,276
Hey, I'm going to
get me another drink.

389
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,283
You want to join me?
- Sure.

390
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,256
All right.

391
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:09,733
Martini, gin-- and don't even
let me smell the vermouth.

392
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:11,784
Uh, vodka on the rocks.

393
00:29:14,322 --> 00:29:16,233
Military?

394
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,554
Ex-ATF.

395
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:19,535
Well, you got an edge.

396
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,316
I thought maybe you might
be CIA or something.

397
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,957
You've been watching
too many spy movies.

398
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,834
No, too many spies--

399
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:30,761
I spent 15 years in
Berlin before the fall.

400
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,186
That was a long time ago.

401
00:29:35,697 --> 00:29:37,504
Good old days, huh?

402
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:38,929
Yeah, good old days.

403
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:40,285
Make that vodka double.

404
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,375
Look, Senator, it's
a question of pain.

405
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:51,442
I know how deeply you were
hurt when that happened.

406
00:29:51,546 --> 00:29:54,640
I want the American people
to feel some empathy.

407
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:56,655
I want them to hurt inside, too.

408
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:02,842
I need a drink--

409
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:06,492
and some air.

410
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,500
[groan]

411
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:12,157
I hate it when she
ruins a good Cohiba.

412
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:15,390
The wall was as much
in the hearts and minds

413
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:17,405
of some of the people.

414
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:19,004
That's why they put up
with it for so long.

415
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,523
Excuse me.

416
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:24,566
Yeah, sure.

417
00:30:35,271 --> 00:30:36,730
BARTENDER: Be with you
in a moment, ma'am.

418
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:37,703
Great.

419
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:47,956
Drinking hard or soft?

420
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:49,381
Soft.

421
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:51,710
Ma'am?

422
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:54,838
Double Bloody Mary, please.

423
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:56,854
I'd hate to think
what you mean by hard.

424
00:30:59,635 --> 00:31:01,199
Double vodka on
the rocks, please.

425
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:03,493
I'd call double vodka hard.

426
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,892
Blood Mary mix makes it soft.

427
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,687
I can't believe you came.

428
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:14,198
I came, and you conquered.

429
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:26,085
Thanks for coming.

430
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:39,188
Oh, it's been a
long night so far.

431
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:08,141
Are you gonna relax?

432
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:13,736
I'm trying to remember where
I saw that conductor before.

433
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,298
Lyman, on behalf
of the Congress

434
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:24,129
of these United States, I
order you to go off duty.

435
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,006
Sorry.

436
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,266
Hey, listen young
lady, I understand

437
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,933
you got a pretty
fancy set up back

438
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:32,505
there in the Senator's car.

439
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:34,730
You wouldn't by chance have a
little extra room in your bed

440
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,155
for me tonight, would you?

441
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:37,510
Sorry, Eddie.

442
00:32:37,615 --> 00:32:39,944
It's all business
tonight, strategy session.

443
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:41,785
I'm just on a little break here.

444
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,863
Oh, I see.

445
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:47,207
I'll just be in the
press car tonight.

446
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:49,780
Our first stop's at Sable
Valley in the morning.

447
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,317
We'll have some time then.

448
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:53,325
All-righty.

449
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,105
All right, I better
get back to it.

450
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:57,287
I'll walk you back.

451
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:13,275
Who's driving?

452
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,466
This is little engine
that could, baby!

453
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,995
It's got automatic pilot.

454
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,246
Let's get started.

455
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,852
The power line's
under the console.

456
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:22,277
Come on, give me a hand.

457
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:23,216
Don't stand on ceremony.

458
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,572
Come on, guys.

459
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,769
Nine hours and 42
minutes 'til first light.

460
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,159
Start hacking, huh?

461
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:30,132
Look out, Harold.

462
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:31,141
[inaudible]

463
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,740
Pardonne-moi.

464
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:38,300
Howdy, Miss Miller.
They're still at it.

465
00:33:42,993 --> 00:33:45,112
Oh, I wish I
could invite you in,

466
00:33:45,217 --> 00:33:46,677
but it's just not a
good night for it.

467
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:49,319
Yeah, well, I know
you got a long night.

468
00:33:49,423 --> 00:33:51,647
I'll just go back to the bar
and have a couple drinks.

469
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:54,115
OK.

470
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:56,792
Think about me tonight.

471
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:57,729
Thanks.

472
00:34:03,777 --> 00:34:05,133
Join me for a drink?

473
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:05,932
No, thank you.

474
00:34:06,036 --> 00:34:07,740
Nice try, though.

475
00:34:07,844 --> 00:34:09,234
Can't blame me, huh?

476
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,695
How much bang for
your buck, dear Bubba?

477
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:35,649
This will make Oklahoma
City look like a cherry bomb.

478
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:39,543
It's got a new, clean-type
warhead, very little fallout.

479
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:44,200
And [blow],, the whole
town disappears.

480
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:46,910
Everybody's dead?

481
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:47,849
Yeah.

482
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,271
OK, great.
Thanks, Lieutenant.

483
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,245
I'll pass it along.

484
00:34:57,651 --> 00:34:58,902
What do you got?

485
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:00,397
That was LAPD, found
a body in the men's room

486
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,073
at Union Station,
throat was cut.

487
00:35:03,177 --> 00:35:05,193
Uh-huh, OK.

488
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:06,235
So, I'm listening.

489
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,556
Uh, let's see.

490
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,198
Body was IDed is one
Kenneth Marshall, worked

491
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:12,804
for a private security firm
hired to guard Senator Douglas

492
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:14,647
Wilson on the Wilson stop tour.

493
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:15,585
Wilson, huh?

494
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,628
Yep.

495
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:18,540
Gun control, anti-militant--

496
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:19,965
where's the train now?

497
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:23,823
It left about six hours ago.

498
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,178
You thinking Anderson?

499
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:27,402
I don't know.
Get West Rail.

500
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:30,218
I want to talk to that train.

501
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:31,851
[dialing]

502
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:45,720
Tell me he's in.

503
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:48,848
Not yet.

504
00:35:48,952 --> 00:35:50,481
You've got a series
of coded numbers.

505
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:54,130
I've tried every possible
combo, and nothing.

506
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:55,799
And I think I've figured it out.

507
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,475
It's gotta be a constantly
changing access code.

508
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,499
See, I've captured this pattern.

509
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:03,480
So, theoretically,
all I need to do

510
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:05,218
is catch up to these
actual numbers.

511
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:10,883
Look, you've got less
than seven hours 'til we

512
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:13,629
reach the Sable Valley station.

513
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,576
If we don't get
control of rail system,

514
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,530
they could route us in
the middle of nowhere.

515
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,276
And nobody's gonna give a damn
if we blow up a bunch of rocks

516
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,666
and sand in the desert.

517
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:24,300
And how are they even
gonna know who we are

518
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:27,080
and what we're doing?

519
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:29,131
Oh, they'll know.

520
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:30,174
We'll see to that.

521
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:41,539
Thank you, son.

522
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:01,698
Where's your buddy?

523
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,957
Haven't seen him in a while.

524
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:06,077
Poor guy doesn't
feel very well.

525
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:07,468
He's in the bathroom.

526
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,067
He had some bad
jalapenos for lunch.

527
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:10,005
Uff!

528
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,127
Thanks.

529
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:22,309
He in?

530
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:24,846
Not yet, some kind of
computer mumbo-jumbo.

531
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,461
Listen, wait five minutes, and
then go check on the weapons.

532
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:31,068
I'm gonna survey
the senator's car.

533
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:32,562
We're gonna have
to remind people

534
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,899
that they have a right to
feel safe in the streets,

535
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,532
that they have a--

536
00:37:37,636 --> 00:37:39,896
ah, the man of the hour.

537
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,275
Dave's late night
coffee express.

538
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,430
Senator, why not
try the speech out

539
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:49,002
on the great unwashed?

540
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:53,034
Hey, Dave, you got a second?

541
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,294
Sure, anything
for the senator.

542
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,892
Well, thanks.

543
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:59,012
Look, I, uh-- I was hoping I
could try a part of my speech

544
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:00,194
out on you.

545
00:38:00,298 --> 00:38:01,758
It's a critical
point, and I'd like

546
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,774
to get an idea of how the
average American might think.

547
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:05,477
Oh, I'm not one for politics.

548
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:07,493
I don't even vote.

549
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:10,238
Uh, I'm sure we don't want to
waste any more of Dave's time.

550
00:38:10,343 --> 00:38:13,575
Well, look, I hope you're
not offended by the question,

551
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,738
but why don't you vote?

552
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:19,310
Well, I don't care for the
federal government coming

553
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:21,708
into our states,
and into our homes,

554
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:23,481
taking away our
freedoms bit by bit,

555
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:25,358
taking away our
right to bear arms.

556
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:27,339
It's not the
America God gave us.

557
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:29,981
It's not the America
I want to live in.

558
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:35,889
Ah, well, I can respect
a man who speaks his mind.

559
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:37,557
Most Americans don't
care to have an opinion.

560
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:39,192
Well, let me check
your sleeping quarters,

561
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:40,895
make sure everything's OK.

562
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,980
Thanks.

563
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:45,412
Be careful what you ask for.

564
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:47,602
Well, let's just hope the
good people of Sable Valley

565
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:48,750
don't share his opinions.

566
00:38:48,854 --> 00:38:50,175
They don't.

567
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:53,581
Sable Valley's demographics are
straight down middle income.

568
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:55,041
Coffee?

569
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:56,013
Yes, thanks.

570
00:39:19,718 --> 00:39:23,750
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Lyman?

571
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:25,035
Yeah?

572
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,121
I just remembered
where I saw you before.

573
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:30,597
Aren't you with the ATF?

574
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,744
Yes.

575
00:39:31,848 --> 00:39:33,447
I was going to do a
story on the Anderson

576
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:35,394
raid a few months back, the
Firebird Action Movement.

577
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,583
And weren't you the point
man on that mission?

578
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:39,773
Yeah, not one of
my better moments.

579
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,136
Cool, do you have a gun?
Can I see it?

580
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:45,403
Well, I don't have
it with me right now.

581
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:46,758
This is my daughter Melinda.

582
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:47,697
I'm Jennifer.

583
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,087
Hi, nice to meet you.

584
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:51,034
Nice to meet you, too.

585
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,806
So where you going?

586
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,135
Well, I got a friend
traveling with the senator.

587
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,873
I just thought I'd go
along for the ride.

588
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:13,139
Well, it's been a long day.

589
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,529
I'm going to get some shut-eye.

590
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:15,885
You coming?

591
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:17,171
No, I got a little more
to do to finish up here.

592
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,527
All right, I'll see you later.

593
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:19,570
OK, good night.

594
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,910
Looks like he's
taking a break.

595
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:42,127
Yeah.

596
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,448
So why don't you
go on back and see

597
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:45,533
her and give her a night cap?

598
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:05,796
--a little bit
better than that.

599
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,874
- You think so?
- Yeah.

600
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:08,716
[knocking]

601
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,724
Oh, good.

602
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:11,357
I wanted you to
all meet my fiance.

603
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:13,895
This is Eddie Lyman.

604
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,180
Thomas Grady.

605
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,857
VALERIE MILLER: Actually,
Agent Lyman of the ATF--

606
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:19,143
DOUG WILSON: Ah, Doug Wilson.

607
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:20,011
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

608
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,610
Well, the pleasure's all mine.

609
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:23,870
Your, uh-- your lovely fiance
has told me a lot about you.

610
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:24,878
I want to thank you.

611
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,476
You ATF guys do a great job.

612
00:41:26,581 --> 00:41:27,414
I'm proud to know you.

613
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,735
Thank you.

614
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:32,455
You all need anymore
coffee, just give me a shout.

615
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,810
Excuse us.

616
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:36,034
DOUG WILSON: Yes, of course.

617
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:37,563
Nice to meet you.

618
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:39,754
Hey, nice meeting you, too.

619
00:41:39,858 --> 00:41:40,657
OK, Thomas--

620
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:42,917
What-- what is
the other speech

621
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:44,272
that you were talking about?

622
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,905
You should have seen
the look on his face.

623
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,852
No way, you're kidding.

624
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:49,521
Hey, can I have a soda?

625
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:50,458
What would you like?

626
00:41:50,563 --> 00:41:53,726
Cola, lots of ice.

627
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,707
Hey, Dave-- and coffee for me.

628
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:02,624
West Rail reports number
207's not responding to calls.

629
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,605
They got a location?

630
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:07,455
What's the nearest town?

631
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,262
Where's the train now?

632
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:12,669
All right, it's just
outside Sonora, on schedule.

633
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:15,761
So it's less than three
hours from Sable Valley.

634
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,186
Can they stop that
train at Sonora?

635
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:18,438
Sure.

636
00:42:18,543 --> 00:42:20,072
West Rail's mainframe can
do a safe stop override.

637
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:21,949
Let's do it.

638
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:23,304
Hello, sir?

639
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,973
All right, I want you to
listen to me carefully.

640
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:33,419
The ATF's riding shotgun.

641
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:34,392
I know.

642
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:43,568
How the hell did
that happen, Carl?

643
00:42:43,672 --> 00:42:45,097
It can't be official.

644
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:48,017
Wilson refuses to have
any federal protection,

645
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:50,519
no Secret Service and no ATF.

646
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:52,812
Then what's Lyman
doing on board?

647
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,273
I don't know.

648
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:55,246
I'm in!

649
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,900
Shut down West
Rail's manual override.

650
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:07,132
They'll know we've
taken this train.

651
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:08,593
They already know.

652
00:43:08,697 --> 00:43:10,296
They've been trying to
raise us the last half hour.

653
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,416
From now on, I don't
give a shit what they know.

654
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,672
Jack, get the weapons.

655
00:43:31,741 --> 00:43:33,270
Ah, come to papa.

656
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:39,492
207's route's gone dark.

657
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,180
All right, now I tied
into West Rail's computer.

658
00:43:48,284 --> 00:43:50,405
Looks like someone
on-board 207 has

659
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:52,282
overridden the override system.

660
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:54,158
Now, if that's true,
West Rail no longer

661
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:56,766
has control or any
contact with 207,

662
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,720
which means no one knows
where 207 is or where the hell

663
00:43:59,824 --> 00:44:02,013
it's going.

664
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:02,952
Except the driver.

665
00:44:10,008 --> 00:44:10,807
OK, got it.

666
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:11,954
Thank you, Senator.

667
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,425
I guess I should let
you get back, honey.

668
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:47,198
Yeah, see you at the
rally tomorrow, OK?

669
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:48,171
Get some sleep?

670
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,109
Yeah, listen, honey.

671
00:44:49,213 --> 00:44:50,534
I just wanted to--

672
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,481
you might want to mention
it to your security guy.

673
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:53,941
There's a couple guys in here--

674
00:44:54,045 --> 00:44:54,809
Eddie, come on.

675
00:44:54,913 --> 00:44:56,130
There's a couple guys that--

676
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:57,451
they just don't look
like reporters to me.

677
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:59,328
All right, I'll mention it.
OK?

678
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:00,475
I think you're a
little paranoid.

679
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:01,934
Get some sleep.
Good night.

680
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:02,873
Night.

681
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:15,872
Oh, Steve, um, in case
we don't have access

682
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:16,810
to power at the station--

683
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:17,680
Already taken care of--

684
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:19,000
I left the batteries on charge.

685
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:20,008
Excellent.

686
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:20,981
So, what's the first shot?

687
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,511
You roll the crowd.

688
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:24,701
Don't miss the
senator's entrance.

689
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:25,744
Your friend feeling better?

690
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,925
Ah, much better.

691
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:28,072
Thanks for asking.

692
00:45:59,145 --> 00:46:00,013
Get down!

693
00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:00,952
Get down!

694
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:02,064
Everybody get down!

695
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:03,072
Sit down!

696
00:46:03,176 --> 00:46:04,602
Senator, back up!
Back up!

697
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:05,575
Sit down!

698
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,339
Sit down!

699
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:07,938
Get down!

700
00:46:08,043 --> 00:46:09,537
[gun shot]

701
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,734
Everyone stay in their seats!

702
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:14,681
Sit down, or I'm gonna
start kill everybody.

703
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:15,794
I'm gonna make you watch.

704
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:16,975
Who will it be, huh?

705
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:18,504
You, them, you, them, you, them?
Huh?

706
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:19,443
What do you think?

707
00:46:22,223 --> 00:46:23,787
I like killing politicians.

708
00:46:23,892 --> 00:46:25,038
I'm good at it.

709
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:26,116
We have hostages.

710
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:27,228
We have the train.

711
00:46:27,332 --> 00:46:30,044
We will kill them.

712
00:46:30,148 --> 00:46:32,998
You gutless son of a bitch.

713
00:46:33,102 --> 00:46:34,423
[gun shots]

714
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:35,778
That is, if we
haven't already.

715
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:36,960
Carl, get 'em to
the press car now.

716
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,872
- Let's go, honey.
- Now!

717
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,819
Move!
Hey, hey, hey!

718
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,452
Easy, easy.

719
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:55,451
[whimper]

720
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:01,533
Where's the ATF man, Carl?

721
00:47:01,637 --> 00:47:03,341
I thought he was with you.

722
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,496
It's not a problem.

723
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,782
Where else can he go?

724
00:47:06,886 --> 00:47:07,998
I'll check.

725
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,029
[bone cracks]

726
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,408
[beep]

727
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:55,467
[dialing]

728
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:00,646
[busy signal]

729
00:49:05,337 --> 00:49:07,319
[dialing]

730
00:49:13,054 --> 00:49:14,583
[busy signal]

731
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:22,438
Any sign of our
young ATF friend?

732
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,079
No, but I caught the porter
trying to stop the train.

733
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:26,227
And?

734
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:28,103
Like I said, I
caught the porter.

735
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:29,668
Oh, god.

736
00:49:29,772 --> 00:49:32,135
Mom, I'm scared.

737
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,402
And a child shall lead them.

738
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:37,036
The girl is correct.

739
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,921
You should all be
very frightened.

740
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:41,694
My name's Anderson.

741
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:42,736
Oh, Jesus.

742
00:49:42,841 --> 00:49:43,709
Who is he?

743
00:49:43,813 --> 00:49:45,378
Shut up, Thomas.

744
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,254
No, tell him who I am.

745
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,610
Right wing militia leader.

746
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:52,155
A blood thirsty
terrorist, child murder.

747
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,797
I prefer to call
myself a patriot.

748
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:58,273
Murdering children
is very effective.

749
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:02,166
Folks tend to
notice a lot sooner.

750
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,320
Carl, why don't you
check the forward cabin?

751
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:06,301
I'd like Mr. Lyman to join us.

752
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:17,424
[dialing]

753
00:50:21,212 --> 00:50:22,220
[ringing]

754
00:50:23,262 --> 00:50:24,619
Gathers!
JOHN GATHERS: Yeah!

755
00:50:24,723 --> 00:50:25,556
It's Lyman!

756
00:50:28,476 --> 00:50:30,041
Eddie, where the hell are you?

757
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,300
I'm on a train
with Senator Wilson

758
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,211
and a group of armed
terrorists, West

759
00:50:34,316 --> 00:50:36,609
Rail number 207, headed north.

760
00:50:36,713 --> 00:50:37,930
What's your location?

761
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,016
I don't know, somewhere
north of Sonora.

762
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,371
Shots have been fired.

763
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:43,039
I don't know if
anyone's been killed.

764
00:50:43,144 --> 00:50:44,499
I'm gonna try to
stop this train.

765
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:45,820
[groan]

766
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:49,018
Eddie-- Eddie!

767
00:50:49,122 --> 00:50:49,956
Hey, what happened?

768
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,006
It went dead.

769
00:50:52,111 --> 00:50:53,605
Call the airport, have
the jet standing by.

770
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:55,830
I want an assault team on that
train's ass within the hour.

771
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,725
[grunting]

772
00:51:21,758 --> 00:51:23,114
[groan]

773
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:52,136
Melinda?

774
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,075
Hi, Melinda?

775
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,096
Scared, huh?

776
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,050
Have you ever heard of
a guy named John Wayne?

777
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:06,108
Yeah, I used to watch
his movies with my dad

778
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:08,055
before my dad died.

779
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,967
You know, I meant
the Duke once.

780
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:13,477
I was in Vietnam, and he was
there visiting the troops.

781
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:16,327
Well, he walked up
behind me, and he

782
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,412
put his hand on my shoulders.

783
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:21,193
And he said, "I want you to
know that we really appreciate

784
00:52:21,297 --> 00:52:24,425
what you're doing here."

785
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,885
Was he big and tough?

786
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,588
Oh yeah, he was tough.

787
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:30,369
He was risking his life
just like the rest of us.

788
00:52:30,473 --> 00:52:32,594
And I guess that's what
I want you to know.

789
00:52:32,698 --> 00:52:36,521
We're all afraid, but
you got to be tough.

790
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:40,692
You got to be brave
just like your mom.

791
00:52:40,796 --> 00:52:42,082
OK.

792
00:52:42,186 --> 00:52:43,854
Thank you.

793
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:46,392
What's keeping Carl, Dave?

794
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,060
Give him a few more minutes.

795
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:52,161
Lookee here, just about time
to strike a blow for freedom.

796
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,867
You know, I never thought I'd
ask the liberal press for help,

797
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,508
but I need you and your
photographer to get a camera

798
00:53:05,612 --> 00:53:08,462
and set it up in the dining car.

799
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,444
Harold, give me your phone.

800
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:11,417
Here you go.

801
00:53:14,823 --> 00:53:16,908
Now, I want you
to call your network

802
00:53:17,012 --> 00:53:19,932
and establish a
satellite uplink.

803
00:53:20,036 --> 00:53:21,809
The senator and I
have a few things

804
00:53:21,913 --> 00:53:25,007
to say to the American public.

805
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:26,987
Well, what if I refuse?

806
00:53:27,093 --> 00:53:28,482
You won't.

807
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:30,185
We've got the guns.

808
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:31,888
I've got your little girl.

809
00:53:31,993 --> 00:53:33,522
And I can't speak for
the rest of my men,

810
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,677
but I wouldn't
hesitate to shoot her.

811
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:37,310
OK, OK.

812
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,423
[gun shots]

813
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,508
[screams]

814
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,073
Hold it!

815
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:45,583
It's OK.

816
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:46,556
It's OK.

817
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,733
Harold, take her
to set up the uplink.

818
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,262
- Mom, don't god.
- I'll be right--

819
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:20,861
- Get up!
- Mom, don't go!

820
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,660
Hey!

821
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:23,294
What are you, an amateur?

822
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:24,336
Huh?

823
00:54:24,442 --> 00:54:25,588
What the hell do you want, huh?

824
00:54:25,693 --> 00:54:26,666
What?
You want to shoot me?

825
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,021
Go ahead, do it.
Do it, go on.

826
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,133
Pull the trigger.

827
00:54:29,237 --> 00:54:30,246
Do it!

828
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,775
If I wanted to kill
you, you'd be dead.

829
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:33,617
I don't have a ransom on you.

830
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:37,162
I want you to help me make a
stand for freedom, for America.

831
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:39,386
I'm sure, as a veteran,
you understand that.

832
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,646
Look, I have no
sympathy for your cause.

833
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,245
You take the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights,

834
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:46,025
you twist it to justify
murdering innocent Americans.

835
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:47,450
You wrote a
rather lengthy book

836
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:49,953
on the politics and policies
of Thomas Jefferson,

837
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,795
and I read it, and it's good.

838
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:55,235
But, as I recall, Jefferson said
"a revolution every 20 years

839
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,556
or so for the country's good."

840
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,268
Now, the way I look at
it, we're long past due.

841
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:00,310
You're no revolutionary!

842
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:02,361
This is no revolution!

843
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,515
You-- you and your
followers-- you're leeches.

844
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,428
You feed on the blood of
dead women and children.

845
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:07,853
That's what you are.

846
00:55:07,957 --> 00:55:09,312
You-- you're not better
than a common street gang.

847
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:12,579
Senator, my wife when
child were also gunned down

848
00:55:12,683 --> 00:55:15,221
in the prime of their
life by ATF agents

849
00:55:15,325 --> 00:55:17,342
sworn to uphold law and order.

850
00:55:17,446 --> 00:55:18,939
Now, you and I have a
lot more in common--

851
00:55:19,045 --> 00:55:20,748
We got nothing in common!

852
00:55:20,852 --> 00:55:22,659
Nothing!

853
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:25,092
Because, as much as I'd love to
kill you, I would never do it.

854
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,517
You know why?

855
00:55:26,622 --> 00:55:29,610
Because I would never,
never stoop to your level.

856
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:33,537
OK, she's got
the uplink ready.

857
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:36,006
Get him outta here!

858
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,744
Get out.

859
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:39,238
Get him in the dining car.

860
00:55:39,343 --> 00:55:41,114
Get him in the-- get the
rest of them in there.

861
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,539
Come on!

862
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:44,174
[whimper]

863
00:55:46,155 --> 00:55:49,039
Jack, where's Carl?

864
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:50,012
Go get him.

865
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:51,358
[knock]

866
00:56:51,463 --> 00:56:52,332
Carl?

867
00:57:44,954 --> 00:57:48,812
Live TV is so exciting,
don't you think?

868
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:51,349
Luke, contact the pick-up feed.

869
00:57:51,453 --> 00:57:53,608
Confirm the rendez-vous
at Gold Canyon Wash.

870
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:08,624
Carl?

871
00:58:31,702 --> 00:58:32,571
This son of a bitch!

872
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:45,049
[sigh]

873
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,706
This is Jennifer Benton.

874
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,930
I am currently
being held prisoner,

875
00:58:52,035 --> 00:58:53,425
along with a number
of other hostages,

876
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:56,345
on a hijacked train
somewhere in California.

877
00:58:56,449 --> 00:59:00,063
The hijacker's name is David
Anderson, longtime leader

878
00:59:00,168 --> 00:59:02,705
of the Firebird Action
Movement, and he

879
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:05,173
wants to say a few words.

880
00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:06,355
Thank you, Jennifer.

881
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:17,615
My men and I have captured a
train, West Rail's number 207.

882
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:23,143
Among our hostages is a United
States senator, Douglas Wilson,

883
00:59:23,247 --> 00:59:27,592
one of the leaders of the
federal government's conspiracy

884
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:30,615
to take away our
freedoms, starting

885
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,083
with our right to bear arms.

886
00:59:33,187 --> 00:59:35,133
Now, I'm sure you're all
familiar with the senator's

887
00:59:35,237 --> 00:59:36,420
bill.

888
00:59:36,524 --> 00:59:38,644
The Firebird Action
Movement has decided

889
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:41,077
to take a stand
against Mr. Wilson

890
00:59:41,181 --> 00:59:42,780
and the federal government.

891
00:59:48,514 --> 00:59:50,183
Roger that.

892
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,122
We got something.

893
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:52,269
Patch us in.

894
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,228
We have a number
of nuclear weapons

895
01:00:00,332 --> 01:00:06,068
at our disposal, the first being
located right on this train,

896
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:08,500
intended to destroy a US city.

897
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:13,539
There'll be no ransom, no
demands, just one big bang.

898
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,510
Let's call it the
shot that started

899
01:00:18,614 --> 01:00:20,838
the second American Revolution.

900
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:27,338
Senator--

901
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:37,175
I'm not gonna be a part of
your little game, Anderson.

902
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:40,581
Seems the senator doesn't have
the passion of his convictions

903
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:43,257
when his speeches aren't
being written for him.

904
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,339
A warning to all
federal government law

905
01:00:49,444 --> 01:00:51,599
enforcement agencies-- do not--

906
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:53,893
do not attempt to
stop this train,

907
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:56,256
or we will detonate
the bomb early.

908
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,454
Oh, and, uh, thanks
for watching.

909
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:05,328
It has to be Sable Valley.

910
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:07,274
So how do we stop him?

911
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:08,352
We can't.

912
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,707
Now maybe Lyman can.

913
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:10,993
Lyman?

914
01:01:11,098 --> 01:01:12,870
What makes you think
he's still alive?

915
01:01:12,974 --> 01:01:15,581
Does TV always give
you that adrenaline rush?

916
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:17,110
Fuck you, Mr. Anderson.

917
01:01:17,214 --> 01:01:19,057
Oh, such language--

918
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,802
you're setting a bad
example for your daughter.

919
01:01:21,907 --> 01:01:25,626
Harold, come here.

920
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:29,553
Easy-- take it easy.

921
01:01:29,657 --> 01:01:31,292
You're going to
kill us, aren't you?

922
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,168
They're gonna kill us.

923
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,454
Yes, we're gonna kill you.

924
01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:09,384
[dialing]

925
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,050
[beeping]

926
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,560
Gathers here.

927
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:20,611
Lyman, where the hell are you?

928
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:24,192
[gun shots]

929
01:02:25,234 --> 01:02:26,763
[gasp]

930
01:02:27,736 --> 01:02:29,856
[gun shots]

931
01:02:33,436 --> 01:02:34,375
Oh my god!

932
01:02:34,479 --> 01:02:35,313
I'll blow her away!

933
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,112
Get away!

934
01:02:36,218 --> 01:02:37,260
No, don't take her!

935
01:02:37,364 --> 01:02:38,025
Sit down!

936
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,172
[screaming]

937
01:02:40,145 --> 01:02:42,090
Don't take my daughter!

938
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:44,142
Don't [inaudible]!

939
01:02:44,246 --> 01:02:47,235
No!

940
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:48,869
Shut up!

941
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,920
[gun shots]

942
01:02:58,009 --> 01:03:00,164
[whimpering and screaming]

943
01:03:02,076 --> 01:03:03,640
DAVID ANDERSON: Get on
the floor, or this girl

944
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,274
doesn't see her 16th birthday.

945
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:06,421
[scream]

946
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:08,854
Throw out the gun.

947
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,904
[screaming continues]

948
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:12,989
Get up.

949
01:03:26,024 --> 01:03:27,587
Harold, bring the hostages.

950
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:33,809
Melinda!

951
01:03:33,913 --> 01:03:34,956
Mom!

952
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:35,895
You OK?

953
01:03:38,536 --> 01:03:40,065
[whimpering]

954
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,248
Been looking for
you for a long time.

955
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,299
Well, I guess you
found me, cowboy.

956
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:54,306
[gun shot]

957
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:55,940
[screaming]

958
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:56,948
No!

959
01:04:57,052 --> 01:04:57,956
No!

960
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,006
[weeping]

961
01:05:06,054 --> 01:05:08,592
Shut up!

962
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,198
Jack, where's Carl?

963
01:05:11,303 --> 01:05:12,276
He's dead.

964
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,423
What?

965
01:05:16,447 --> 01:05:17,350
God damn it!

966
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:18,810
I'm gonna kill you!

967
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:21,312
Harold, Harold, Harold!

968
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,128
Listen, easy.

969
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,770
I'm gonna be real merciful.

970
01:05:26,874 --> 01:05:28,542
They're all gonna
vaporize at ground zero

971
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:31,253
in one toasty nuclear blast.

972
01:05:31,357 --> 01:05:32,748
Easy.

973
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:33,790
Harold, stay with me.

974
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:38,622
You all right?

975
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:39,595
I'm OK.

976
01:06:01,353 --> 01:06:05,142
ATF, puts your hands up!

977
01:06:05,246 --> 01:06:06,079
Fire a warning shot.

978
01:06:06,184 --> 01:06:08,756
[gun shots]

979
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:20,122
Get him outta here.

980
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:16,775
OK, we got the car and the
truck, but what the hell for?

981
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:18,200
Auto shut down--

982
01:07:18,304 --> 01:07:21,189
that train's emergency brakes
kick in after a collision--

983
01:07:21,294 --> 01:07:22,614
federal regulations.

984
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:25,290
MAN: Let me go, you bunch
of [inaudible] thugs!

985
01:07:25,395 --> 01:07:27,898
And gag him before I do
something I'll be sorry for.

986
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:44,581
[beeping]

987
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:04,079
Hey, the driver called in.

988
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:05,018
He's in position.

989
01:08:09,188 --> 01:08:11,900
Just a few more minutes--

990
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:14,332
prepare to stop the train.

991
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:15,549
Okey-dokey.

992
01:08:39,357 --> 01:08:40,227
You want to join us?

993
01:08:54,825 --> 01:08:56,875
Why are we slowing down?

994
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:58,544
We're meeting my
mother for lunch.

995
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,190
[hiss]

996
01:09:22,386 --> 01:09:26,835
Dave, that car's just sitting
up there on the tracks there.

997
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,156
I'm mean, it's just sitting.

998
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:35,247
Don't stop.

999
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:36,359
Full speed ahead-- it's a trap.
- No, no.

1000
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,819
Wait a minute.
We can't do it!

1001
01:09:52,034 --> 01:09:54,676
Sir?

1002
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,857
Excuse me.
Get out!

1003
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:57,283
- No!
- Sorry, sorry.

1004
01:09:57,387 --> 01:09:58,048
No!

1005
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:00,306
Shit, he's--

1006
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:09,448
Here we go.

1007
01:10:09,552 --> 01:10:11,429
Y'all better brace yourselves!

1008
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:13,271
[inaudible]

1009
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,209
He's still alive!

1010
01:10:14,313 --> 01:10:16,052
Back off!

1011
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:17,163
[gun shots]

1012
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:19,597
[screaming]

1013
01:10:22,377 --> 01:10:24,358
[grunting]

1014
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,182
[brakes squeaking]

1015
01:11:04,746 --> 01:11:05,893
What's happening?

1016
01:11:05,997 --> 01:11:07,839
It's the automatic
engine shut down.

1017
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:09,160
That's what happens
after a collision.

1018
01:11:09,264 --> 01:11:10,377
I tried to tell you that.

1019
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:18,787
Override it.

1020
01:11:18,892 --> 01:11:21,047
I can't do that until
it comes to a full stop.

1021
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:30,188
Let's go!

1022
01:11:30,293 --> 01:11:31,335
[grunt]

1023
01:11:32,378 --> 01:11:33,942
[gun shots]

1024
01:11:34,914 --> 01:11:37,070
[grunting]

1025
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:52,814
Luke, I want you to do me
a favor, and go back there,

1026
01:11:52,919 --> 01:11:54,831
and start feeding the
ATF some dead hostages.

1027
01:12:32,924 --> 01:12:35,809
Harold, I want you to
punch up the grid map

1028
01:12:35,913 --> 01:12:39,354
and find me an alternate
route to Sable Valley.

1029
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:40,988
[gun shots]

1030
01:12:43,595 --> 01:12:45,159
[grunting]

1031
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:53,778
[gun shot]

1032
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:55,447
All right, put your hands
up, you son of a bitch!

1033
01:13:02,537 --> 01:13:03,614
Put 'em up!

1034
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:09,141
Now, get up, Jack.

1035
01:13:09,246 --> 01:13:11,261
Jack!

1036
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:12,234
Jack!

1037
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:18,316
Oh, shit.

1038
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:19,951
You should not have done that.

1039
01:13:20,055 --> 01:13:22,036
[gun shots]

1040
01:13:33,019 --> 01:13:35,870
Then how are we
gonna get out of here?

1041
01:13:35,974 --> 01:13:39,240
God damn it, just do it!

1042
01:13:39,345 --> 01:13:40,213
OK, OK!

1043
01:13:56,272 --> 01:13:57,801
[gasp]

1044
01:14:08,088 --> 01:14:10,070
[beeping]

1045
01:14:14,832 --> 01:14:15,527
Got it.

1046
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:16,952
Good, good, good.

1047
01:14:17,056 --> 01:14:18,133
Now, are you sure you know
how to run this thing?

1048
01:14:18,237 --> 01:14:19,037
Yeah, I think so.

1049
01:14:19,141 --> 01:14:21,157
All right, get
us moving again.

1050
01:14:26,371 --> 01:14:28,178
I think we should get
off the train, Senator.

1051
01:14:48,441 --> 01:14:49,936
Hold your fire.

1052
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,202
Are you coming?

1053
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:07,384
There's still a bomb
somewhere on this train.

1054
01:15:07,488 --> 01:15:08,461
He won't set it off here.

1055
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:10,721
There's no target.

1056
01:15:10,825 --> 01:15:12,528
Exactly.

1057
01:15:12,632 --> 01:15:13,571
[gun shot]

1058
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,239
[scream]

1059
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:21,912
No!

1060
01:15:22,016 --> 01:15:22,885
No!

1061
01:15:45,964 --> 01:15:47,910
Don't shoot!

1062
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,649
Gathers, don't shoot!

1063
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:50,587
Lyman!

1064
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:03,760
I'm gonna get you out of
here as soon as I can, honey.

1065
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:05,463
OK, hold on.
- I want to go home, mom.

1066
01:16:05,568 --> 01:16:06,540
I know, I know.

1067
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,861
Looks like you took
a couple of hits.

1068
01:16:07,965 --> 01:16:09,947
You OK?

1069
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:13,040
Yeah.

1070
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:14,048
[groans]

1071
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,766
He still has a
bomb on board, right?

1072
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:23,988
Yeah, and Valerie's
on that train.

1073
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:25,379
It's your call, Eddie.

1074
01:16:25,483 --> 01:16:27,464
What do you want to do?

1075
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:29,828
I want a helicopter.

1076
01:16:29,932 --> 01:16:30,766
You got it.

1077
01:16:43,522 --> 01:16:44,564
Jack and Luke?

1078
01:16:44,669 --> 01:16:45,711
They're dead.

1079
01:16:45,815 --> 01:16:47,728
Did you find an alternate track?

1080
01:16:47,832 --> 01:16:49,396
Yeah, yeah.

1081
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,150
This, uh-- this old line used
to be a cattle loading depot.

1082
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:55,026
Now it's just a
nice subdivision.

1083
01:16:55,131 --> 01:16:59,580
Good-- track homes, a lot of
innocent victims-- very nice.

1084
01:17:06,357 --> 01:17:07,226
Take this.

1085
01:17:11,466 --> 01:17:12,996
[grunt]

1086
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:31,382
Why switch routes?

1087
01:17:31,486 --> 01:17:32,911
Because they know
where we're headed.

1088
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,205
They're gonna throw
everything they have at us.

1089
01:17:35,309 --> 01:17:37,118
This way we lose 'em.

1090
01:17:37,222 --> 01:17:38,369
Let's face it.

1091
01:17:38,473 --> 01:17:40,766
Either way, a lot of
people are gonna die today.

1092
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:42,400
So why don't you
find the sideline

1093
01:17:42,504 --> 01:17:44,103
and disengage the brake system?

1094
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:46,119
Nothing's gonna stop this train.

1095
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:48,970
The thing is, I'd
have to access West

1096
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:51,124
Rail's central computer system.

1097
01:17:51,228 --> 01:17:52,549
They might see the switch.

1098
01:17:52,653 --> 01:17:53,974
By the time they do,
it's going to be too late.

1099
01:17:54,078 --> 01:17:56,059
I've got a nuclear
device, Harold!

1100
01:17:56,163 --> 01:17:58,771
I think I can afford
to take chances.

1101
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,822
You bastard!

1102
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,455
[grunting]

1103
01:18:11,283 --> 01:18:12,812
[beeping]

1104
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:34,153
[beeping]

1105
01:19:07,241 --> 01:19:10,196
Lyman, West Rail called.

1106
01:19:10,301 --> 01:19:12,733
Seems an old sideline
has been activated,

1107
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:14,298
coordinates as follows--

1108
01:19:14,402 --> 01:19:19,720
C marker 33, one mile north,
northeast of Highway 6.

1109
01:19:19,824 --> 01:19:20,728
Copy that?

1110
01:19:20,832 --> 01:19:21,665
Yeah.

1111
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,889
[beeping]

1112
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:48,289
OK.

1113
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:55,658
We're locked on the sideline.

1114
01:19:55,762 --> 01:20:00,385
Now, how do we get
off a moving train?

1115
01:20:00,489 --> 01:20:01,428
You don't.

1116
01:20:01,532 --> 01:20:03,097
[gun shots]

1117
01:22:04,815 --> 01:22:06,345
[clanging]

1118
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:09,055
[grunting]

1119
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:12,601
[gun shots]

1120
01:22:32,933 --> 01:22:34,462
[beeping]

1121
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:39,676
Shit!

1122
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,026
[grunting]

1123
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:06,300
[beeping]

1124
01:23:08,907 --> 01:23:10,888
[grunting]

1125
01:23:26,598 --> 01:23:28,162
[gun shot]

1126
01:23:43,699 --> 01:23:45,262
[groaning]

1127
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,851
[sigh]

1128
01:23:56,211 --> 01:23:57,740
[beeping]

1129
01:24:03,927 --> 01:24:06,499
Eddie, oh my god!

1130
01:24:06,603 --> 01:24:09,002
The bomb!

1131
01:24:09,106 --> 01:24:10,670
I can't stop the train.

1132
01:24:10,774 --> 01:24:14,702
Anderson blocked
out the controls.

1133
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:15,814
OK, OK.

1134
01:24:15,919 --> 01:24:16,787
All right.

1135
01:24:16,891 --> 01:24:17,795
Careful.

1136
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,047
OK, all right.

1137
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:21,514
It's all right, I
know what I'm doing.

1138
01:24:21,619 --> 01:24:22,974
OK.

1139
01:24:23,078 --> 01:24:24,016
VALERIE MILLER: Hurry.

1140
01:24:24,121 --> 01:24:25,476
All right, it's disengaged.

1141
01:24:25,581 --> 01:24:26,588
Oh, thank god.

1142
01:24:26,693 --> 01:24:27,735
Come on.

1143
01:25:12,259 --> 01:25:13,614
What's happening?

1144
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:15,005
The C-3's gonna blow a
trench through the G-Rail.

1145
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:15,944
Oh god.

1146
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:23,381
How much time do we have?

1147
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:24,355
None.

1148
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,036
[beeping]

1149
01:25:39,404 --> 01:25:40,343
Eddie, get in!

1150
01:26:05,437 --> 01:26:06,272
You all right?

1151
01:26:06,376 --> 01:26:07,384
[sigh]

1152
01:26:08,113 --> 01:26:08,948
Yeah.

1153
01:26:17,185 --> 01:26:18,749
You guys OK?

1154
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:20,313
Yeah.

1155
01:26:20,418 --> 01:26:22,399
You know, that's a brave
young daughter you have there.

1156
01:26:22,503 --> 01:26:25,145
Old Duke Wayne would
have been proud.

1157
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:27,856
Her old mom is very proud.

1158
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,331
Well, you're not that old.

1159
01:26:31,435 --> 01:26:33,278
Senator Wilson,
are you married?

1160
01:26:36,823 --> 01:26:38,874
No, actually, I'm not married.

1161
01:26:38,978 --> 01:26:40,889
That's my girl.

1162
01:26:40,994 --> 01:26:42,523
[giggle]

1163
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:01,883
It's funny.

1164
01:27:01,987 --> 01:27:05,602
I used to be afraid of flying.

1165
01:27:05,706 --> 01:27:07,756
This trip was your idea.

1166
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:09,112
Your bad luck, Lyman.

1167
01:27:09,216 --> 01:27:10,468
I'm just a little
accident prone.

1168
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:16,968
I thought you were dead.

1169
01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:35,040
Can we go home?

1170
01:27:35,145 --> 01:27:36,014
Yeah.

1171
01:27:56,347 --> 01:27:59,336
