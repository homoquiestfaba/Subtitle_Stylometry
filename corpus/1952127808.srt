My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

- What is the formula volume sphere
- Four pi times the radius of three to the third.

116
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,800
I assume that you have devised
November insult to today.

117
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,800
Affirmative.

118
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,800
It's a 35-time when trying
to give me an emotional reaction.

119
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
There are neither man nor vulcanian.
You Do not place in this universe.

120
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Here. Are human eye.
Show sad, huh?

121
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,800
Perhaps an emotional reaction
needs physical stimuli.

122
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Your father is a traitor.

123
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Because married
bitch with that man.

124
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,200
I have called foul.

125
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,800
emotions are deeply rooted
in our race.

126
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,800
Even deeper than people.

127
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,800
Logic provides a serenity
rarely touched by humans.

128
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,600
We control feelings,
let them control us.

129
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
suggesting to be fully vulcanian,

130
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,800
but you married a human woman.

131
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
As ambassador on Earth,
is my duty

132
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
to observe and understand
human behavior.

133
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,500
marriage with your mother was... logic.

134
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Spock.

135
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,800
You are perfectly able
to decide your own destiny.

136
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,400
The question is: what way
you to get?

137
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,600
Only you can decide that.

138
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,400
Spock. Come to see you.

139
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
- No.
- Spock.

140
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,800
You have nothing to be nervous.
It will be good.

141
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm not angry, mother.

142
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,100
And the "good" is ambiguous.
I find unacceptable.

143
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,800
- Can I ask a personal question?
- Anything you want.

144
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,500
complete discipline

145
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,800
and to remove all emotions?

146
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,300
I hope I did not think that you judge.

147
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Spock.

148
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No matter what you choose to be,
you always have a mother proud.

149
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,800
You have competed expectations
your instructors.

150
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,800
Your file is impeccable final.
With one exception.

151
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,800
I see that you applied
Fleet and Starfleet.

152
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,800
It was logical to have more options.

153
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Logic, but not necessary. You accepted
Vulcanianã Academy of Sciences.

154
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,800
It's remarkable, Spock,
you made so many

155
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
despite your disadvantage.

156
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,600
Stand up.

157
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,700
Mr. Minister, you can clarify
what disadvantage you meant?

158
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Your mother human.

159
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,800
Gentlemen minºtri Council,
must answer.

160
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
No vulcanian refused na
admission to the Academy.

161
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,800
What are half-human,
your reputation remains intact.

162
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Spock, you are committed
vulcanianã respect tradition.

163
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,800
Why do you come today
Council before?

164
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,800
To give ongoing need
to get emotional mutiny?

165
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,800
The only emotion I want
gratitude is so transmitted.

166
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,300
Thank you, gentlemen, ministers,
for your attention.

167
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
Life long and prosperous.

168
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

169
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,800
Hello, I would like some tea klabnian,
three Budweiser,

Two cocktails cardassiene and...

171
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,800
- Try Slusho. Good.
- A Slusho. Thank you.

172
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,700
So many drinks for a woman.

173
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
- And a swig of Jack Daniels without ice.
- Two. I paid for it.

174
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,800
I am paying for myself.
Thanks, but no.

175
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,800
You want to know my name
before you reject me?

176
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm no good.

177
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,400
You did okay without him. I'm Jim Kirk.

178
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,800
If you tell me the name,
you up my part.

179
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
- E Uhura.
- Uhura? No more days.

180
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,800
Just the name I thought.

181
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,800
- Uhura and how?
- Just Uhura.

182
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,800
- You name
- Uhura's name.

183
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,400
When you have no name?

184
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,800
So you cadet. What study?

185
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,800
Xenolingvistica.
Do not know what is that.

186
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,800
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

187
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Are you good at languages.

188
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
I'm impressed.

189
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,800
For a moment I thought
you are an oaf sluggish

190
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
that sex
only with farm animals.

191
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Not only.

192
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,800
locals that bothers you, right?

193
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Over extent.
But I can make one side.

194
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,800
Can you cope?
It's an invitation?

195
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,800
- Be careful what you mean.
- Calm down, sweetie. Just kidding.

196
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,800
Listen, peasants.
Maybe you can not count

197
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,800
but we are four
and you just one.

198
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,600
Then bring some May
to be an equal fight.

199
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,900
Stop it, guys.

200
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Stop.

201
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That is enough.

202
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You guys get it.

203
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,800
Leave out all.

204
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,800
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,500
- What the hell?
- I just had a drink.

206
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,800
- You okay, son?
- Can you whistling loudly.

207
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,800
I came to believe
where bartender told me who you are.

208
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
- And who is Captain Pike
- Son of your father.

209
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,800
May I get one?

210
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,800
USS Kelvin was
my dissertation topic.

211
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,800
I admire your father because it was believed
in landlocked.

212
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,800
- And the lesson learned.
- Depends how you look victory.

213
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
- You know, right?
- Thanks.

214
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,800
And he was sitting in the fire
to dash blindly.

215
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,800
In my opinion, Fleet Starfleet
lost this quality.

216
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Why are you talking to me?

217
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Because I read the file
while saliva on the floor.

218
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,800
You have excellent results in tests
aptitude. So what's the problem?

219
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,800
You like to be the only
criminal genius of the Midwest?

220
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
Maybe I like it.

221
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Your father dies and thank you
Living with a below normal.

222
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,200
But you feel that you are supposed
to something better, especially.

223
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,800
- Înroleazã back to parc.
- Let me enlist?

224
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,800
Do not rule comes in recruitment?

225
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
If you are even half
as your father, Jim,

226
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Fleet would need you.

227
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,800
Can you reach the officer four years
and have their own ship in eight years.

228
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,800
You know what's Federation
It is very important.

229
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,800
It's a humanitarian armada
for keeping the peace...

230
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
I have done?

231
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,800
I have done.

232
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Riverside sites. Shuttle
by new recruits leave tomorrow at 8.00.

233
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,800
Your father was the captain
the boat for 12 minutes.

234
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,200
He saved 800 lives,
including you and your mother.

235
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I dare you to be better than him.

236
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Nice engine.

237
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
It's yours.

238
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,800
Four years? I get it in three.

239
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
At ease, gentlemen.

240
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,800
No I noted surname.

241
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,800
- You need a doctor.
- I said.

242
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
I need a doctor.
I'm a doctor.

243
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,800
- Place your place in your
- I had a place in the bathroom without windows.

244
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm suffering from aviafobie.
Fear of dying in a plane.

245
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,600
Sir, that take place not
sure I sit down.

246
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,800
- Okay.
- Thanks.

247
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,800
<i>This is Captain Pike.
I got permission off.</i>

248
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,800
I might throw up on you.

249
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,800
- Navetele these are safe.
- Do not tickle me, boy.

250
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,800
If you have a crack in the fuselage,
give us blood boil in 13 seconds.

251
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
A sudden rash sun
will come in prãjeascã chairs.

252
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,800
And if you pricopseºti
andorian with herpes,

253
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,800
to see how to be a calm
when to have your eyes bleed.

254
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,800
The mean disease threats
wrapped in gloom and silence.

255
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,800
I hate to give you news of me,
but the fleet does in space.

256
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,800
No place to go. Former wife
the entire planet to get a divorce.

257
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,300
I have left
ciolanele than.

258
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,300
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

259
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,600
<i>Three years later.</i>

260
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Captain Nero.
You are called on deck, sir.

261
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,800
Ayel says the time has come.

262
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,800
I arrived at the coordinates calculated.

263
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,800
There's nothing here. What order?

264
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
We wait.

265
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,800
I expect that we left
the home to be destroyed.

266
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,800
As I wait for 25 years.

267
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,800
- And after you kill him?
- Let's kill him?

268
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,200
No to kill him.
I put it to look.

269
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Capture ship.

270
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Welcome back, Spock.

271
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,800
- Why are you so happy?
- I do not know what you mean.

272
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,800
- I guess not.
- Hello, ladies.

273
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
- I give the test again.
- Kidding.

274
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,800
Tomorrow morning.
And I want to participate too.

275
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,800
I have better things to do than to see
how do you embarrass a third time.

276
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
I am a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

277
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Bones, do not disturb
nobody passes the test?

278
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,800
Jim, it's Kobayashi Maru.
Nobody passes the test.

279
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,800
And no one give the
the second time darmi third.

280
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,800
We have to study.

281
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
studying my ass.

282
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,500
Jim, I think I love you.

283
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,600
- What strange.
- Light.

284
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,800
- You said it was weird?
- Yes, but...

285
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Do not you love me?

286
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,800
- Oh, no. My.
- I thought you said it away.

287
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,800
Obviously, there's Quick, get under the bed.

288
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,800
- Under the bed?
- Down with you. Do not see you here.

289
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,800
- Why not?
- I promised not get guys.

290
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,800
- How did you guys...
- Jos.

291
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing?

292
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Okay. What is strange.

293
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,800
I was in a laboratory sensor
the long range.

294
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,800
Yes. I hold that all night.

295
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,800
monitor systems
and we received an SOS transmission.

296
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,800
- Really?
- Yes.

297
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,800
Near a prison planet
Klingon.

298
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,800
- No.
- Yes.

299
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
A Klingon armada
was destroyed. 47 ships.

300
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,200
So you go back
in the lab tonight?

301
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,800
- Gail, who is it?
- Who is?

302
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,800
The under the bed
the mouth breathing.

303
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,800
- I hear the breathing
- Tu.

304
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
- I have a days tomorrow.
- A shipwreck.

305
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,800
- Gail, see you.
- Out.

306
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,800
- If you take the test, my first name mean?
- No. I would take him.

307
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,100
It seems interesting
you received a transmission.

308
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,800
I receive an SOS message
from USS Kobayashi Maru.

309
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,800
The ship has no power
and is immobilized.

310
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Fleet Starfleet has ordered us to save.

311
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Fleet Starfleet has ordered us
to save, Captain.

312
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Two ships broke klingoniene
in the neutral zone and we were in sight.

313
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,800
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

314
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,800
Yeah, no worries.

315
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,800
- He said not to worry about?
- Will take seriously simulation?

316
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Three other ships klingoniene
decamufleazã and we shall take in the viewfinder.

317
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
- No it is not a problem, right?
- Shooting, Captain.

318
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,800
Let infirmary
be ready to receive

319
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
All staff
the damaged vessel.

320
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,800
And how to save when we are
klingonieni surrounded by, captain?

321
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,800
Let infirmary.

322
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,800
- collected hits. Shields at 60%.
- I understand.

323
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,800
I should retort?

324
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,500
- No.
- Of course not.

325
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
What? What happens?

326
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,800
Aim torpedoes. Get ready
to launch to klingonieni.

327
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,800
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, have raised shields.

328
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,500
Really?

329
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,800
- No shields.
- Fire in all enemy ships.

330
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,800
A torpedo for each.
Do not be wasted ammunition.

331
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,800
I took all the ships in sight.

332
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,900
I opened fire.

333
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,800
All ships have been
destroyed, Captain.

334
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,800
Start saving survivors.

335
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
So I managed to remove
all enemy ships.

336
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,800
We have no one injured on board

337
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,500
survivors and rescue
the Kobayashi Maru is in progress.

338
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,300
What has gone kid
that of your test?

339
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,800
I do not know.

340
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,800
I have convened this meeting to
solve an unpleasant matter.

341
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,800
James T. Kirk, out in front.

342
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
Cadet Kirk, the Council had been
made aware evidence

343
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,800
that you violated the ethical code of conduct

344
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,800
under regulation 17.43
Code of Fleet Starfleet.

345
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,800
want to say something
before we start?

346
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Yes. I have the right
to know my acuzatorul.

347
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,800
Come forward, please.

348
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,800
He's the commander Spock, one
of the best of our graduates.

349
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,700
A scheduled exam
Kobayashi Maru during the past four years.

350
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
Commander.

351
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,800
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install
and execute a subrutinã

352
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,800
code programming
changing test conditions.

353
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,100
- Why fight?
- In academic language, you cheater.

354
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Let me ask a question
although I think everyone knows the answer.

355
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,800
It is very unfair, no?
You can not scheduled to be passed.

356
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Your arguments do not include the
possibility of a situation without exit.

357
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,800
I think in situations without output.

358
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,800
So you not only violated the rules,
but you never understood the lesson.

359
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Enlighten me.

360
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,300
Cadet Kirk, you should know best
that a captain can not outwit death.

361
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,800
- Bestsellers
- Due father.

362
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Lt. George Kirk took command ship
before being killed in combat, right?

363
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,800
- You hate that I passed the test.
- I didn't understand the purpose test.

364
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,800
- You light me once.
- The goal is to know fear.

365
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,800
Fear of death in the safe.
Up fear

366
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
and you keep control
on you and crew.

367
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,200
It's a necessary quality
all masters of the fleet.

368
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Excuse me, sir.

369
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,800
I received an SOS signal
from Vulcan.

370
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,800
How are the bulk of the fleet
in the Laurentian,

371
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,800
ordering all fall
to submit immediately to hangar 1.

372
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,400
Free.

373
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,800
- Who was that bastard moke
- I do not know.

374
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,900
But I like it.

375
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,800
Bracer, USS Farragut.

376
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,800
McCoy, USS Enterprise.
McGrath, USS Walcott.

377
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,800
Spader, USS Hood.

378
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,800
Welcome to Fleet Starfleet.
Good luck.

379
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,800
I cried name.

380
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,700
Commander, I've cried name.
Kirk, James T.

381
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
Kirk, you are suspended
the academy. Stay on the ground

382
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,600
...Academy leadership to
give a verdict.

383
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
Jim, I give you a favorable verdict.

384
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,800
Most likely.

385
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,800
You go, Jim.

386
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,200
Yes. Go. Take care.

387
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,700
- Excuse me.
- Yes. Sorry.

388
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,400
Shit.

389
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Come with me.

390
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Uhura, USS Farragut.
Chomsky, USS Antares.

391
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,700
Go to your items.
Success.

392
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,100
- Bones, where we going?
- I see.

393
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,800
- Commander, can we talk?
- Yes, It.

394
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,800
- I've been chief schoolgirl
- Yes.

395
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,800
And you've demonstrated many times
an amazing auditory sensitivity

396
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,800
and I quote, "an unsurpassed ability
to identify abnormalities sonic

397
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,800
in transmission tests
subspaþiale?

398
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
Yes, repeatedly.

399
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,800
And although you know you want
to serve on the USS Enterprise,

400
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,800
Farragut are apportioned?

401
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,800
It was an attempt to avoid
suspicions of favoritism.

402
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,600
Do not. Are apportioned on the Enterprise.

403
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,800
- Yes. So it seems.
- Thanks.

404
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,800
- What are you doing?
- You do a service.

405
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
I could not let you so
unhappy there. Sit.

406
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,800
Let me make a vaccine
against viral infections

407
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,500
from puricii melvarieni.

408
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
- What?
- As you dare symptoms.

409
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,800
- What are you talking about?
- No longer see the left eye.

410
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Yes, already no longer see.

411
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
You gonna go head pain
and to sweat a lot.

412
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,800
- You call this service?
- Yes. I remain indebted.

413
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Kirk, James T. Not allowed
to serve on the Enterprise.

414
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
The code says that medical treatment
and transport a patient

415
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,800
is decided by his doctor.

416
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
I am the doctor
and take him on board by Mr Kirk.

417
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,800
Or you want to explain
Captain Pike

418
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Why Enterprise flew in a crisis
without one of its medical officers?

419
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,600
- Continue.
- Continue.

420
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
I might throw up on you.

421
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Jim, look.

422
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,300
- Jim, look.
- What?

423
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,800
You have to change.

424
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,800
I do not feel well. I'm sweating.

425
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,300
Damn, damn that moke.

426
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
- Mr Spock.
- Captain.

427
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
- the engine room is ready for launch.
- Thanks.

428
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

429
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
fast deserves more
than we can afford today.

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,800
Botezarea they will reward us

431
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,800
Continue.

432
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,800
All the bridges, this is Captain Pike.
Ready to go.

433
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Pilot, propulsoarele.

434
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,800
The facilities were docului
withdrawn all, Captain.

435
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,400
I started propulsoarele.
Docul We separate the space.

436
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,800
Fleet out of docul space captain.
All ships are ready to warp.

437
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,800
- Set course for Vulcan.
- Yes, Captain.

438
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,800
Exchange introduced.

439
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,700
Maximum speed. Let him beat.

440
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,800
- Lt, where is the pilot McKenna
- E lung sick, sir.

441
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,800
I was able to undergo post.

442
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,800
- I'm Hikaru Sulu.
- Are you a pilot, right?

443
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,800
Indeed, sir.
I do not know what does not work.

444
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
Forgot hand brake?

445
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Do not.

446
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,800
I realize it. Just...

447
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You have disabled amortizorul
external inertial?

448
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,400
- Ready to warp, sir.
- Let's beat.

449
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,800
- Where are we?
- In the infirmary.

450
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,800
- He.
- It hurts a little suffering.

451
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,800
What are you doing?

452
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,800
- itching are normal?
- Symptoms will not last long.

453
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,800
- I give you a sedative easy.
- Better not meet you.

454
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Stop grumble.

455
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
How you...

456
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Unbelievable.

457
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,800
The motors are full,
Captain.

458
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,800
The guy from Russia. What you said
you name? Chekov? Chirpov?

459
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,800
- Sublt. Chekov, Pavel Andreev, sir.
- Okay.

460
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,800
Chekov, Pavel Andreev,

461
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,600
Yes, sir.

462
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,800
authorization code for sublt
95 Wictor Wictor 2.

463
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,800
<i>Authorization unrecognized.</i>

464
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
authorization code for sublt
95 Victor Victor 2.

465
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
<i>access permitted.</i>

466
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,800
Be careful, please.

467
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,800
At 22.00, telemetry devices
have detected an anomaly in the neutral zone.

468
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,800
It seemed to be
an electrical storm in space.

469
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,800
Soon after, he received Fleet
SOS signal from Vulcan

470
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,800
that the planet is record
seismic activity.

471
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,800
Our mission is to evaluate the
situation on Vulcan

472
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,800
and to help exhaust
if needed.

473
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,800
We arrive at Vulcan over three minutes.
Thank you for your attention.

474
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
Electrical Storm.

475
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,800
Jim, you were awake. How do you feel?

476
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
- God.
- What?

477
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,800
- What the hell is this?
- A response to the vaccine.

478
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,800
Nurse Chapel, give me 20 cc
of cortisone.

479
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,600
Yes, sir.

480
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,800
It seemed to be
an electrical storm in space.

481
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,800
We have to stop the ship.

482
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,800
Jim. No kidding. No need
to accelerate your heart rhythm.

483
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,800
Captain, show it on It. Uhura.

484
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,800
I have never seen reaction
so severe in medical school.

485
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,800
- flying into a trap.
- Do not move, Jim.

486
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,400
Stop.

487
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,800
- Uhura.
- Kirk. What are you doing?

488
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,800
What about the message said planet
Klingon prison?

489
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,800
- What happened to your hands?
- Who gets attacked klingonieni?

490
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,800
- They romulani
- What ship?

491
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,800
- What I mouth
- I was numb tongue.

492
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,800
- numb Language
- Got a cure.

493
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,800
- What ship?
- Romulanã.

494
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,800
- Romulanã
- Yes.

495
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,200
- Yes.
- Yes what?

496
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,600
Nero Prod seven ships
federal way to us.

497
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,800
- Jim
- What?

498
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,800
- Jim, come back.
- Captain.

499
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,800
Captain Pike, the ship must stop.

500
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,800
Kirk, how the hell
did you get on board Enterprise?

501
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
Captain, this man has
a severe reaction to a vaccine.

502
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,800
delirious.

503
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,800
The Vulcan is not a disaster
Natural. It attacked the romulani.

504
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,800
Romulani? Cadet Kirk, you were
the attention of quite a day.

505
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,800
McCoy, take him back to the infirmary.
Talk later.

506
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,800
- Yes, Captain.
- Sir, this anomaly...

507
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,800
Mr. Kirk may not have
to be on this ship...

508
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,800
- I understand. I wear a grudge.
- Under the regulations...

509
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,800
I would like to do it again.

510
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,800
- As you remove the cadet...
- trying.

511
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,800
Cadet that tries
to save the deck.

512
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,800
suggesting to stop on the way
during a rescue mission?

513
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,800
There's rescue mission.
Listen to me. It's an attack.

514
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Based on the information?

515
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,800
The same anomaly today,
electrical storm from space,

516
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,800
and came on the day of my birth.

517
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,800
Even before a ship
romulanã attack USS Kelvin.

518
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,800
You know that, sir.
I have read the dissertation.

519
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,800
ship, arms
incredibly advanced

520
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,800
never been seen since.

521
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,800
Kelvin was attacked
Klingon border area.

522
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,800
Last night, at 23.00,
was an attack.

523
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,800
47 ships klingoniene
were nothing romulani.

524
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
It was reported that romulanii
were in one massive ship.

525
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,800
And you know where
the attack on klingonienilor?

526
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,800
Sir, I intercepted
and translated the message.

527
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,800
- Kirk's report is correct.
- Going into a trap, sir.

528
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,800
Romulanii we expected. I'm sure.

529
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
The explanation is logical fall.

530
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,800
And It. Uhura's expert xenolingvisticã.
Conclusions are reliable.

531
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,800
Scan the vulcanian.
Search romulanã the transmission.

532
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,800
Sir, I do not know if we can distinguish
romulana of vulcanianã.

533
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,800
How about you? Talk romulanã, cadet...

534
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,800
Uhura. All
three dialects, sir.

535
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,800
- Uhura. It replaced the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,800
Hannity, calling USS Truman.

537
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,800
All other vessels have come
from warp to Vulcan

538
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,800
but I lost contact with them.

539
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,800
Sir, receive transmissions
romulane or any kind.

540
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,300
Because are attacked.

541
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,400
Up shields. Red Alert.

542
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,800
Vulcan to come
over five seconds.

543
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,100
4... 3... 2...

544
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,400
- avoidance maneuvers.
- Right, sir.

545
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,800
- Damages to larboard.
- Deflectoarele resist.

546
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,500
Stay on Job.
Technician Olson, report.

547
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,800
Revers up.
Return of 90 degrees to starboard.

548
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,600
Take us under them, Sulu.

549
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
- Sir, another ship Federal.
- Destroy it and this one.

550
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,800
launched torpedoes.

551
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,800
Captain, armeazã torpedoes.

552
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
auxiliary energy deviate from nacelle
larboard in front shields.

553
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,800
- Sulu, report.
- Shields at 32%.

554
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,800
They have strong arms, sir.
Stop resist another shot.

555
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,800
- Call Fleet Command.
- Captain.

556
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,800
The ship dropped romulanã
a pulse of energy

557
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,800
volcano in the atmosphere.

558
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
The signal of our ability blocks
teleportare and communication.

559
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
All the energy in front shields.
Ready to respond with all guns.

560
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,800
Weapons prepared.

561
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,800
Wait.

562
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,500
- Increase the body image.
- Yes, sir.

563
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,800
Captain, we call.

564
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
Hello.

565
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,800
I am the captain Christopher Pike.
Who is speaking?

566
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,800
Hello, Christopher. I am Nero.

567
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,800
You have declared war Federation.
Take Yourself

568
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,800
and I will convene a conference with leaders
romulanii in a neutral place.

569
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,100
Do not speak on behalf of Empire.
Act separately.

570
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,500
As you vulcanian officer.
Right, Spock?

571
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
Excuse me, but I do not think
I did know.

572
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,800
Do not.

573
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,800
Not yet.

574
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,800
Spock, I want to show you something.

575
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,800
Captain Pike, your system
teleportare for not working.

576
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,800
See what I did with the rest of
your armada. You have a choice.

577
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,800
Will you come on a shuttle Narada
negotiations.

578
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,600
That's it.

579
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,800
- You know you'll kill.
- Survival is unlikely.

580
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,800
Captain, we will not
nothing to do with diplomacy.

581
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,800
It's a mistake to go on the boat.

582
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,800
- I agree. Rethink your strategy.
- I understand.

583
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,800
I need officers with training
the grapple.

584
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
I am training, sir.

585
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,800
Come with me.

586
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,800
And you, Kirk. You still
not supposed to be here.

587
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,500
- Chekov, just shipping.
- Yes, Captain.

588
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,300
Prepare red material.

589
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Yes, sir.

590
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,800
No carrier, we can
Teleport on the ship.

591
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,800
We can not help Vulcan,
we can not perform the task.

592
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,800
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and technician Olson
will jump shuttle.

593
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,800
You land on your
they descended into the atmosphere

594
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,800
and we deregleazã equipment,
you disable,

595
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,800
and then you ship the Teleport.

596
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Mr. Spock, I let you
to order Enterprise.

597
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,800
Once back in service
communication systems and teleportare,

598
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,800
contact Fleet
and report what is happening here.

599
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,800
And if everything fails, withdraw your

600
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,800
and then the junction with Fleet
Laurentian system.

601
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,800
Kirk, I promote
the rank of First Officer.

602
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,800
- How?
- Captain.

603
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,800
Sorry. There are
farsele with normal people.

604
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,800
Not a farce, Spock.

605
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,800
And I am no longer captain, but you.

606
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,600
Let's go.

607
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,800
Sir, what happens to you
after you disable the probe?

608
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,800
Obviously, you need to save me.

609
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,800
Take care with the ship, Spock.
E shiny new.

610
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,800
- Dr. pure, report.
- Are McCoy.

611
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,800
Doctor was puri deck 6.
It's dead.

612
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,800
When I assumed the powers of
as chief medical officer.

613
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, what news.

614
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,500
<i>shuttle 89, of permission
off.</i>

615
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,800
- You explosives, right?
- Yes.

616
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,800
Can not wait
to thrash some romulani.

617
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,100
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

618
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,800
What training did you battle?

619
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,500
Fencing.

620
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Prepare to jump.

621
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,700
<i>shuttle commander, out
of the radius USS Enterprise.</i>

622
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,800
Gentlemen, we are approaching the zone of salt.

623
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,800
You have a chance
to land on the platform.

624
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,800
It could be defended,
so you jump in the last minute.

625
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,800
3... 2... 1.

626
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,800
Enterprise will not be able
Teleport if you disable the probe.

627
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,600
Good luck.

628
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,800
Team Intervention
enter the atmosphere, sir.

629
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,700
20.000 feet.

630
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,800
Is platform
the 5800 meters.

631
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,600
Kirk to Enterprise.
Target is 5,000 feet.

632
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,800
4.600 meter platform.

633
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,600
4.100 feet.

634
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,800
4.000 feet.

635
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,800
3.000 feet.

636
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,700
2.000 feet.
Open parachute.

637
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,800
- 1,000 meters.
- Open parachute, Olson.

638
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,800
Not yet.

639
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,800
- 800 meters.
- Open parachute.

640
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,400
- Olson, open parachute.
- 100 meters.

641
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,800
Olson.

642
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Olson died, sir.

643
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,100
Kirk landed, sir.

644
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,100
Give me your hand.

645
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,800
Olson had explosives.

646
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,500
I know.

647
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,800
- What do we do?
- Take it.

648
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,800
jitter of the signal disappeared.
We teleportare capacity.

649
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,800
transporter
works again.

650
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,800
Chekov, check the gravity sensors.
I want to know what planet do.

651
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,900
Yes, Commander. Sorry, Captain.

652
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,800
Sonda was sabotaged, sir,
but I have reached the planet.

653
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,300
Launch red material.

654
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,800
Kirk to Enterprise. Launched a
object in the hole drilled through the earth.

655
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,800
- I read, Enterprise
- Yes, sir.

656
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,800
Captain, sensors gravity
have jumped in the graph.

657
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,800
If I calculated correctly,
creating a singularity...

658
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
...that will consume the planet.

659
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,800
Creates a black hole
in the volcano?

660
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,800
Yes, sir.

661
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,500
How long has the planet?

662
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,800
Minute, sir.

663
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,800
Command vulcanian alerts
to order the evacuation of the planet.

664
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,800
On all the channels and frequencies.
Stay on standard orbit.

665
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,800
Yes, sir.

666
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,800
You go where?

667
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,800
To evacuate the High Council Vulcanian.
They protect cultural history.

668
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,800
- My parents are among them.
- I can Teleport?

669
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,800
It is impossible. I'm in Room Katra.

670
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,800
I gotta go get him.

671
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,900
- Chekov, you command.
- Yes.

672
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,800
Kirk to Enterprise.
Teleport us from here.

673
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,800
Wait. We fixãm signal.

674
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,800
- Withdraw the probe. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

675
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,600
Pick one.

676
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,800
I can not fix them. Do not move.

677
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,400
Sulu.

678
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,400
Sulu.

679
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,500
Hold on.

680
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,700
Gotcha.
Open my parachute.

681
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,800
Kirk to Enterprise.
Fall without parachute.

682
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,800
- Teleport us.
- Trying, but can not drop the signal.

683
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,800
We move too fast.

684
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,800
I can do this.

685
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,800
- Hold the post.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,800
black hole expands. If you go
immediately, we will not be able to get away.

687
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,300
Move. Can I do this.

688
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,800
Teleport us.

689
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,800
- Enterprise, where are you?
- Wait.

690
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,600
Now! Now!

691
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,500
Wait. Compensation
gravitational pull.

692
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,700
You got it.

693
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,400
- Thank you.
- Sure.

694
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,800
Free platform.
Teleport me to the surface.

695
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,800
What area?

696
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,800
Te Teleport down?
Are you mental?

697
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,200
- Spock, do not do that.
- Enables.

698
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,800
- Spock.
- Urgent need to leave the planet.

699
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,600
Mama now.

700
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,800
Spock to Enterprise.
Teleport us.

701
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,400
fix signal.
Do not move. Stay there.

702
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,400
Teleportare in 5... 4... 3... 2...

703
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,100
- Mom!
- I lose.

704
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,600
I lost it.

705
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,800
Official master provisional
date stellar 2258.42.

706
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,800
I received news
the master Pike.

707
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,800
I consider therefore hostage
killer of war named Nero.

708
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,800
Nero, which he destroyed the planet mother
and the six billion inhabitants of them.

709
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:33,400
Although the essence of culture survives
the elders are now on the ship

710
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I estimate that I have escaped
more than 10,000.

711
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,200
I am part of a
endangered species.

712
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,400
Sorry.

713
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,400
Sorry.

714
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Tell me what you need.
Tell me.

715
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,800
I need all...

716
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,900
...to continue to do his job.

717
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,800
I think you got more questions
for me.

718
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,200
I have one for you.

719
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,800
I need frequencies subspaþiale
Federal border protection.

720
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,200
Especially in the area of the Earth.

721
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,800
Christopher, answer my question.

722
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,800
No, you answer to genocide
committed against a peaceful people.

723
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,600
I p®evented the genocide.

724
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,500
In time to come,
it is a mining vessel.

725
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,800
I chose a life of honest work.

726
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,700
Let me have a wife pregnant.

727
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,800
I was left on the planet
and I was doing the job

728
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,800
ta Federation and he did nothing.

729
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,800
I left to burn people
planet when its broken in two.

730
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,800
Spock And we helped. He betrayed.

731
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,800
Are you confused and poorly informed.
Romulus was destroyed.

732
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,800
I still exist. Blame Federation
what not happened yet.

733
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,800
I happened.
I saw with my eyes.

734
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,200
Do not tell me that never happened.

735
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,400
And when I lost her,
I swore revenge.

736
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,800
And for 25 years, I planned
vendetta against the Federation.

737
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,800
I forgot how to go
a normal life.

738
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,400
But I forgot the pain.

739
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,800
The pain that you feel now
all survivors volcano.

740
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,800
My goal, Christopher,

741
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,800
is not only to avoid
home loved destruction

742
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,100
but to create a Romulus
issued by the Federation.

743
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,700
But then you will be saved.

744
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,800
That's why you destroy
all federal remaining planets.

745
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,800
Starting with yours.

746
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,300
When we talk to you.

747
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
You give me frequencies systems
Defense Earth.

748
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,100
Limacºi Centauri.
Trunk is attached to the brain.

749
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,800
Secret toxin a
will force you to answer.

750
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,800
The frequencies, please.

751
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,800
Christopher Pike
captain of USS Enterprise...

752
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,800
How you want.

753
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,800
You have confirmed that Nero
is heading for Earth?

754
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,800
their trajectory shows
other destination, Captain.

755
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,800
Thank you, It.

756
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,800
Earth could be next stop,
but must assume

757
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,800
that all planets
Federation are targeted.

758
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,800
Get up on the chair.

759
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,800
If the Federation is the target,
us what we have destroyed?

760
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,800
Why waste ammo
There was a threat.

761
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,800
No e. He said that he wanted to show me
thing: the destruction of my planet.

762
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,800
And how did that?

763
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,800
How did they put romulanii
hands on such weapons?

764
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,800
technical knowledge necessary to
create artificially in a black hole

765
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,800
suggests an answer.

766
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,800
A technology may also
be used theoretically

767
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,800
to create a tunnel
the space-time.

768
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,800
What the hell? I am a doctor, not physicist.

769
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,800
suggesting that came
from the future somehow?

770
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,800
If you eliminate the impossible, what
remains, however improbable,

771
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,800
the truth.

772
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,800
What poetic.

773
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,800
Why would an angry romulan
future with captain Pike?

774
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,800
E master. Know details
about defensive systems.

775
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,800
We need to get of the ship,

776
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,800
so incapacitãm
and make it up on the Pike.

777
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,800
We are the technological inferiority.
A rescue attempt is preposterous.

778
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,800
Nero's ship should be
out of the warp so that we get.

779
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,800
To ask the technicians to work
at warp speed boost.

780
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,800
The crew working on repairing
radiation leaks

781
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,800
on lower decks.

782
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,800
There must be a way.

783
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,800
You must join to equal Fleet
sorþii next conflict.

784
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,800
I will be no further conflict.

785
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,800
When we are together
will be too late.

786
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,800
You said it was the future and knows
what happens.

787
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,800
It's logical to be unpredictable.

788
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,800
You assume that Nero knows
how events will take place.

789
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,800
Instead, the presence of Nero
changed our history

790
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,800
since the attack on USS Kelvin,
events culminating in today's

791
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,800
creating a new chain of events
can not be anticipated by anyone.

792
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,800
A parallel reality.

793
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,800
Right.

794
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,800
Whatever has been our lives

795
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,800
if it was not disturb
space-time continuum,

796
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,800
Our destinies
have changed.

797
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,800
Mr. Sulu, to enter the course
Laurentian. Warp 3.

798
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,800
Spock, do not do that.

799
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,800
Go back to the fleet
is a big waste of time...

800
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,800
These are orders
Captain Pike when he left.

801
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,800
We ordered more
go back to rescue him.

802
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,800
- Spock, you are the master now.
- I know the responsibilities.

803
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,800
With every second wasted, Nero
approaching its target.

804
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,800
Right. Therefore, please admit
that I own...

805
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,800
No to let give bir fugiþii with
instead of hunting him on Nero.

806
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,700
Security, escorting him out.

807
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,900
- No.
- Jim!

808
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,700
To disappear from the ship.

809
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,800
Computer, where are they?

810
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,800
<i>On Delta Vega, the planet
Class M. uncertain.</i>

811
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,800
<i>There is an outpost of Fleet
13 km north-west.</i>

812
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
- Stay in capsule...
- kidding.

813
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,400
stellar Date: 2258.42.

814
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,700
...4 times... never mind.

815
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,800
Captain Spock provisional
abandoned me on Delta Vega.

816
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,800
I consider this a breach of protocol
security 49.09,

817
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,100
on treatment
prisoners on board.

818
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,900
James T. Kirk.

819
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,800
- What?
- How did you find?

820
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,800
How do you know my name?

821
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,200
I am and always will be your friend.

822
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,800
Listen, you know.

823
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,700
I am Spock.

824
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,800
Rubbish.

825
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,800
I am delighted to see you, buddy.

826
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,800
Especially after the events
today.

827
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,800
I am grateful
that helped me today,

828
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,800
but if you Spock,
you know that we are not friends.

829
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,800
I hate. Have you abandoned
here for sedition.

830
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,800
- uprising
- Yes.

831
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,200
So are you captain?

832
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,700
Do not. You are the captain.

833
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,800
Pike was taken hostage.

834
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,600
For Nero?

835
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,800
What do you know about him?

836
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,800
It's a very disturbed romulan.

837
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,800
Please. Allow me.

838
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,800
It will be easier.

839
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,800
- What are you doing?
- We will merge minds.

840
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,700
More than 129 years, a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

841
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,800
Is that where I come from, Jim.

842
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,700
The future.

843
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,500
Steaua became supernova.

844
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,800
destroy everything in your way.

845
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,900
I promised romulanilor
co to save the planet.

846
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,800
I have fitted the fastest ship.

847
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,800
Using material red after
to create a black hole

848
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,800
that would absorb
star hit.

849
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,800
I was on the road when
a catastrophe occurred.

850
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Supernova has destroyed Romulus.

851
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
There was time.

852
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,800
I had to extract the material red
and so throw the supernova.

853
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,800
When to start on the road
return, I was intercepted.

854
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,800
She said Nero,
last of the Romulan Empire.

855
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,000
In an attempt to escape, both
I was captured by the black hole.

856
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,400
Nero passed first
and arrived first.

857
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,800
For the next 25 years,
he expected arrival.

858
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,800
But while Nero
years have passed...

859
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,800
...have passed to me
just seconds.

860
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,800
We went through a black hole.

861
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,200
And I expect Nero.

862
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,400
I quarrel with me
loss of his world.

863
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,800
I caught a ship
and he spared my life.

864
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,500
From a single reason:
to know the pain.

865
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,400
Ma Teleport here
to private revenge.

866
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,800
Just as he has not been able
save planet

867
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,200
no I do not I could it
save mine.

868
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,800
Billions of lives lost
because of me, Jim.

869
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,100
Because I failed.

870
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,800
Forgive me. Transfer emotional
e effect of contopirii minds.

871
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,800
- So you nervous.
- Yes.

872
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,800
Getting your time
changed our lives.

873
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,800
Jim! Let's go.

874
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,800
Not far from here,
is an outpost of the Fleet.

875
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,400
Wait.

876
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,200
where you live...

877
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,800
...I met my father?

878
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,800
Yes.

879
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,800
I often say that he has inspired
to enlist in the parc.

880
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,800
He lived to be proud that you
captain on the Enterprise.

881
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,800
Captain?

882
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,100
A ship that should
come back as soon as possible.

883
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,800
- Speed constant.
- Course 151, vector 3.

884
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,800
- The Laurentian.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

885
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,900
- Did you call?
- Yes, Doctor.

886
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,800
I know that James Kirk is your friend.

887
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,800
I imagine that has been
difficult to get support.

888
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,800
I thank?

889
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,800
- I just recognize the difficulties.
- Permission to speak freely.

890
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,800
- Please.
- Really?

891
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,800
Okay. Have you lost your mind vulcaniene?

892
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,800
It's the logical choice to remove him Kirk
Probably. But it is correct?

893
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,800
We have a proverb. If you want
to participate in a race in Kentucky,

894
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,800
do you let the stallion barn.

895
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,800
curious metaphor, Doc.
Stallion must tamable

896
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,800
before-and fructify potential.

897
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,800
You could even pretend you
that was a tough decision.

898
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,800
I intend to make every effort
to restore contact with Fleet.

899
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,800
But if I can cheer
bocind crew on hallways,

900
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,600
I will be happy
medical recommendations.

901
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,600
Excuse me.

902
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,200
green monkey blood.

903
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,400
What?

904
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,800
You know how unacceptable
's situation?

905
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,800
- Fascinating.
- What?

906
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,800
I am sure that you work,
but he could not have come sooner?

907
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,800
I'm here for six months, living in cans
and the promise of good meals.

908
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,800
And I know exactly how things stand.

909
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,800
There are still punished for
what was clearly an accident.

910
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,800
- You Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

911
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,800
Yes, I am.
You've come to the right place.

912
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,800
Only if no other officer's Fleet
as toiling and hungry here.

913
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,800
- I.
- Shut up.

914
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,800
You do not do anything. Eat only
one grain and you sick.

915
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,800
I real food.

916
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,800
But now you are here
so where is it?

917
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,800
Are you that Scott who developed
teleportãrii transwarp theory.

918
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,800
For this is about.
How do I get here?

919
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,800
I had a little dispute
with my instructor

920
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,800
in matters of physical relativist
how to link to subspaþialã trip.

921
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,800
He thinks that range transport
is a kind of grapefruit.

922
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,800
The limit to 160 km.

923
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,800
I said that not only can Teleport
a grapefruit from one planet to another

924
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,800
in the same system, which
what is pretty easy,

925
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,800
but the forms of life.

926
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,800
I tested on copoiul
Admiral Archer.

927
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,800
I know the dog. What happened?

928
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,800
I will tell you when reappears.
I do not know. I feel somewhat guilty.

929
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,800
If I say that theory
transwarp is correct?

930
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,800
That is possible to Teleport
on a ship traveling at warp?

931
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,800
If there would have been discovered,
I have heard of it.

932
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,800
The reason that I have
heard of it, Mr Scott,

933
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
is that I have discovered it yet.

934
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,800
- Are you in the future?
- Yes. It's Me, no.

935
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,800
Great. Have sandwiches there?

936
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,800
It's a little old.
But to handle.

937
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,800
I've changed it a bit.

938
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,800
Everything is ready.

939
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,800
So went Enterprise
for the first time in space?

940
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,800
It is a well endowed lady.

941
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,800
I would like to put a hand on nacelele
general. Forgive technical language.

942
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,800
Even if I believe what I say
what we do, where you live

943
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,800
what do not believe everything remains the problem
teleportãrii the Enterprise

944
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,800
when traveling at speeds supraluminice,
without a platform upon arrival.

945
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,800
Get out. No room for climbing.

946
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,800
The concept of teleportare transwarp

947
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,800
's like trying to hit
a bullet with another smaller

948
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,800
when you are blindfolded
and ride a horse.

949
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,800
What's this?

950
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,700
The equation for ta
teleportare transwarp.

951
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,600
Let's see.

952
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,800
I imagine. I went in thinking
that is the mobile space.

953
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,300
Come with us, right?

954
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,800
No, Jim. This is not my destiny.

955
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,800
Destiny...

956
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,800
Spock no other I believe.
But you can explain them.

957
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,800
He must not know
of my existence. Promise me.

958
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,800
I can not say that you follow your
orders. Why not? What happens?

959
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,800
Jim, you should not break
this rule.

960
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,800
To block Nero, you alone
must take command of the ship.

961
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,800
How? Over your dead body?

962
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,800
Preferably not.

963
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,800
But there are rules Fleet 619.

964
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,800
Under 619, if an officer commanding
's emotional compromise of mission

965
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,200
quit must command.

966
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,800
So everything we do
is to compromise your emotional?

967
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,200
Jim, I lost planet.

968
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,800
I'm already emotionally compromised.

969
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,800
Pregnancy's push to get
to show this.

970
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,600
Okay. If you go, come on.

971
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,800
Have you how to live with me. Go.

972
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,500
Let's go back in time and change
history means to cheat.

973
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,200
I learned that
from a old friend.

974
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,600
Life long and prosperous.

975
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,600
Mr Scott?

976
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,700
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

977
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,900
Wait a minute.

978
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,500
Do not.

979
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,300
<i>valve opening</i>

980
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,700
<i>Start valve opening.</i>

981
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,800
Are you okay?

982
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,800
My head is spinning and wet,
but the rest are okay.

983
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,400
Captain Spock, detect access
Third to the tank water.

984
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,300
Displays on display.

985
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,800
Security, isolate the engine room.
We intruders in Section 3.

986
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,600
Set phasers on paralysis.

987
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,400
Wait.

988
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,800
Come with me...

989
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,800
...avarice.

990
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,800
Who are you?

991
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,800
- I am with him.
- It's me.

992
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,800
Getting to warp speed.
How you Teleport on the ship?

993
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:39,800
You are genius. Find yourself.

994
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,800
As a provisional captain
the ship, I order you to answer me.

995
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,600
And I do not respond
provisional captain.

996
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,800
You are not upset or mad
by my lack of cooperation, right?

997
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,800
- You are the membuat Fleet
- Yes. I need a towel.

998
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,800
The death Court martial
I order to explain

999
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,800
how did you ship the Teleport
while we go to warp.

1000
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:01,800
I respond.

1001
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,900
You answer me.

1002
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,800
- I prefer to remain neutral.
- What's with you, Spock?

1003
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,800
Planeta he was destroyed, my mother,
and killed are not upset at all.

1004
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,800
If you assume that these experiences
I affect

1005
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,800
the ability to order
ship you wrong.

1006
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,800
But you say that fear
is required to order.

1007
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,700
I have seen the ship?
You saw what he did?

1008
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,800
- Of course yes.
- So you afraid, right?

1009
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,800
Do not you let me hold sermons
about emotions.

1010
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,800
- Then do not stop me?
- Get away from me.

1011
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,800
How is it you feel anger?
Or despair?

1012
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,800
Or the need to retaliate by whatever
means the death of your mother.

1013
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,800
- Get away from me.
- I feel nothing!

1014
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,800
Probably does not mean
anything to you.

1015
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,500
Have you ever loved her.

1016
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,400
Spock.

1017
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,800
Doctor, you are apt
to serve.

1018
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,800
order release based on the fact
that I was emotionally compromised.

1019
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,600
Evaluate the time and date in the log ship.

1020
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,800
I like the ship.

1021
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
It was exciting.

1022
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,800
Congratulations, Jim. Now we have
no captain nor first officer

1023
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,800
to replace him.

1024
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,800
I have.

1025
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,800
- What?
- Pike called him first officer.

1026
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,500
- No kidding.
- Thank you for support.

1027
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,300
I hope you know what you do, captain.

1028
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,900
I hope so too.

1029
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,800
Warning, the Enterprise crew.
Here James Kirk.

1030
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,800
Mr. Spock gave up the post and called me
me master provisional.

1031
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,800
I know you expect
to join the fleet.

1032
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,800
But I will start tracking
enemy ship for Earth.

1033
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,800
All departments and positions
battle to be ready in 10 minutes.

1034
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,200
And you perish in November, or her.

1035
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,900
Kirk finished.

1036
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,800
Say what troubling you, Spock.

1037
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,800
It would be unwise.

1038
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,100
What you need
not ever cautious.

1039
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I am as confused as in childhood.

1040
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,600
You should always be a child of two worlds.

1041
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,300
I am happy for that.

1042
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,800
And for you.

1043
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,400
I feel anger at
who killed my mother.

1044
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,900
An anger that no one can wield.

1045
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,800
My thoughts, as she said...

1046
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,200
...is not to try.

1047
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,800
I once asked you
why I married your mother.

1048
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,100
I got married because I loved her.

1049
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,800
Either way, you must get
the ship undetectable to Nero.

1050
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,800
You will not have barged in there
with gun in hand, Jim.

1051
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,800
The calculations do not support your idea.

1052
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,800
- Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Chekov. What?

1053
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,800
Analyzing the Naradei
from Vulcan

1054
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,800
I have determined that Nero
will pass Saturn.

1055
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,800
As you said we should hide
by Nero, otherwise we will destroy them.

1056
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,800
If Mr. Scott succeeds
warp speed to 4,

1057
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,800
and if you leave the warp behind one
of the months of Saturn, such as Titan,

1058
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,800
magnetic distortion
planet's rings

1059
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,800
we will be invisible
sezorii for his Nero.

1060
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,800
From there, while probe
not on,

1061
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,800
We can Teleport to the enemy ship.

1062
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,800
Yes. It might work.

1063
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,800
- Wait. Kid, how old are you?
- 17, sir.

1064
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,800
Has 17 years.

1065
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,800
Doctor.

1066
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,800
Mr. Chekov is right.
I confirm data telemetry.

1067
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,800
If Mr. Sulu brings us
in a favorable position,

1068
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,800
I will ship to the Teleport Nero,
I will steal the black hole,

1069
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,800
and, if possible, would bring
back Captain Pike.

1070
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,800
Do not let you do that, Mr Spock.

1071
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,800
Romulanii and vulcanienii
have a common ancestry.

1072
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,800
cultural similarities will help me
to access the computer

1073
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,800
and locate the device.

1074
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,500
My mother was human. Earth e
only homeland I have left.

1075
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,800
Friday with you.

1076
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,600
I would cite the regulation,
but I know that to ignore it.

1077
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,700
See? Already begin to know.

1078
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,900
Prepare probe.

1079
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,500
Stop full 3... 2... 1.

1080
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,800
Go for 5 seconds
at quarter speed boost.

1081
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,800
Then go on propulsion.
At my signal.

1082
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,800
Yes.

1083
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,300
Run.

1084
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,800
Transport Hall. We are
in position above the Titanic.

1085
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,800
Really? Bravo, Mr Sulu.

1086
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,500
- Situation, Scotty
- Unbelievable. The ship is heading.

1087
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,800
Anything that would happen, Mr Sulu,
if you consider that the tactical advantage

1088
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,800
to pull the ship that even
if you are on board. It's an order.

1089
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,800
Yes, sir.

1090
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,800
We will contact you when we are Enterprise
Teleport ready to be back.

1091
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,600
Good luck.

1092
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,800
- I will be back.
- So be it.

1093
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,900
- O you monitor frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1094
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,800
- First it's Nyota
- No comment.

1095
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,800
Okay. If the enemy ship
was built logically

1096
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,800
a Teleport to the cargo hold,
where no one.

1097
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,500
Enable.

1098
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,800
Captain, Fleet officers
we approached the ship.

1099
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,200
- One of them is vulcanian.
- No.

1100
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,400
Ayel.

1101
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,800
- Learn what you can.
- Are you sure?

1102
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,100
Yes. I cover you.

1103
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,900
You know where the hole negeri?

1104
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,100
And Captain Pike.

1105
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,800
Move.

1106
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,800
They enabled the probe.

1107
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,800
Communications and teleportarea
does not work.

1108
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,800
Sulu, tell me that i have located.

1109
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,800
Otherwise I will not be able
Teleport back.

1110
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Kirk and Spock are on their own.

1111
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,800
provide complications. Ship model
is more advanced than I expected.

1112
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,800
<i>Voice print analysis

1113
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,800
<i>Welcome, Ambassador Spock.</i>

1114
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,400
Weird.

1115
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,800
Computer, which is the date of manufacture?

1116
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:44,600
Date stellar 2387. Ordered
Vulcanianã Academy of Sciences.

1117
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,800
It seems that you hid
important information.

1118
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,800
Can you fly the ship, right?

1119
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,800
I feel that I have piloted it.

1120
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,800
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1121
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,800
Statistically speaking, chances of success
is less than 4.3%.

1122
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,800
I work.

1123
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,800
If I back
tell It. Uhura...

1124
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,100
Spock, one to go.

1125
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,800
Fascinating.

1126
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,100
<i>startup sequence initiated.</i>

1127
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,900
Nero, ordered disable
probe that does not...

1128
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,700
You know the face
in the history of Earth.

1129
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,800
James T. Kirk was considered
grand man.

1130
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,800
He became captain of the USS Enterprise.
But that was another life.

1131
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,100
A life that I missed,
as I did with your father.

1132
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,800
Captain Nero. Ship vulcanianã
was stolen. We destroyed the probe.

1133
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,400
Spock!

1134
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,800
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

1135
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,800
Spock, I had to kill you
when I had the chance.

1136
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,800
confiscate illegally acquired this ship

1137
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,800
and I order you to surrender
unconditional ship.

1138
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,800
Shoot him.

1139
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,400
- Sir, if red light matter...
- Spock I want the dead.

1140
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,800
- go to warp.
- Watch it.

1141
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,600
Yes, sir.

1142
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,500
Your species is lower
than I expected.

1143
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,300
You can not talk to.

1144
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,800
What?

1145
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,800
I got my gun.

1146
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,800
What to do?

1147
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,800
<i>Ambassador Spock,
are on collision course.</i>

1148
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,100
Fire all weapons.

1149
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,800
<i>launched missiles. If the ship is hit,
red material will ignite.</i>

1150
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,800
I understand.

1151
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,800
Captain, detect another ship.

1152
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,800
- What are you doing here?
- Follow orders.

1153
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Enterprise, now!

1154
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,800
Good timing, Scotty.

1155
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,800
I never Teleport three people
from two different places

1156
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,800
on one platform.

1157
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
- Jim.
- Bones.

1158
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,800
It was remarkable.

1159
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,800
Captain, the enemy lost ship
supply. They dropped the shields.

1160
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,600
- Call them now.
- Yes.

1161
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,800
Here Captain James T. Kirk
the USS Enterprise.

1162
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,800
The ship's compromised.
It's too close to singularity

1163
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,400
to survive without
which we are willing to offer him.

1164
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,800
Captain, what are you doing?

1165
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,800
compassion may be the only way
to win peace with Romulus.

1166
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,800
It's logical, Spock.
I co you like.

1167
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,800
Not this time.

1168
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,800
I prefer to see die Romulus
a thousand times,

1169
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,800
I prefer to die in agony
Just accept your help.

1170
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,800
You got it.

1171
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,800
Aim phasers.
Pull with all weapons.

1172
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,600
Yes, sir.

1173
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,800
- Sulu, go home.
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,800
- Why are not the warp
- You are, sir.

1175
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,800
Kirk to the engine room.
Take us out of here, Scotty.

1176
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,300
To be sure, Captain.

1177
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,800
Captain, we are caught
the gravity field.

1178
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:27,800
Maximum speed warp. Now.

1179
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,300
You give everything you are, Captain.

1180
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,800
Well, everything is not enough.
What other ideas do you have?

1181
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,800
If you evacuate warp core
and it detonated,

1182
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,300
is likely to burst free,
but not promising anything.

1183
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,800
Do it!

1184
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,900
- Clear the area.
- Yes, sir.

1185
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,200
Pa?

1186
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,200
You are our father.

1187
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,900
They left few vulcanieni.
We afford to ignore.

1188
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,800
Then why did you sent the ship Kirk,
when you could explain to me the truth?

1189
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,800
Because had needed each other.

1190
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,800
Do not want to miss a chance
to achieve great things together

1191
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,800
a friendship that will define
both

1192
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,800
the ways in which
still no figures.

1193
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,800
How did you sure
to keep secret?

1194
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,800
He inferred that appear paradoxes
catastrophic for the universe

1195
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,800
if it will violate the promise.

1196
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,800
You lied.

1197
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,800
- I insinuative.
- A bet?

1198
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,800
An act of faith.

1199
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,800
Which I hope to repeat it
in your future in Starfleet Fleet.

1200
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,800
We are faced with extinction.
It's logical to resign from the fleet

1201
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,800
and to help rebuild
our race.

1202
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,800
But can you be in two places at once.

1203
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,800
I suggest you stay in the fleet.

1204
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,800
I found a planet suitable for
