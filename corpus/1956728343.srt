00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,478
This whole thing right here,
is this is an act?

103

- [Stammers] Well, um,
I do, I do.

117
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,168
- I found out from keisha
that you just pump the gas.

118
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,744
Welcome to my station.

119
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:04,919
How can I help you today,
beautiful?

120
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,530
- I need directions to
Manhattan,

121
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,880
can you please give them to me?
I'm in a rush.

122
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:13,057
- Ah, New York City ain't
going nowhere.

123
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:14,581
- Ah, this is your station?

124
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,365
- Mm-hm.
- You're Phil?

125
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:19,063
- Yeah, I mean, don't worry
about the name tag.

126
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,979
- You are a gas attendant.
- Well, that is true.

127
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:24,329
- And the only thing you own
is that silly little bike over
there

128
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:28,856
and that silly little bike isn't
even the collector's item

129
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,466
- you say it is.
- Oh, now, that's a lie.

130
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,903
- It's a huffy!
- Well, yes, it is a huffy,

131
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:36,428
but it is a 1990 huffy,
discontinued model.

132
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,996
Therefore, by definition,
a collector's item.

133
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,911
- Don't lie.
Hey, you?

134
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:41,999
- Aaah!

135
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,566
- Can you come over here
for a second?

136
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,916
- Why people always gonna run
to the white guy?

137
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,051
- Can I aks you a question?
- Yeah, you just did.

138
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:53,924
- Does he own this place?
- He owns that huffy.

139
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:58,886
- Is his real name Phil?
- It says cool on his name tag.

140
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,018
- You're in the middle.
- Hey--

141
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,946
Yo, what was that?
- Yup.

142
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,036
- Look around you, man,
we work at a gas station.

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,431
- Mm-hm.
- You fix cars, I pump gas.

144
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,954
I can barely keep
my fingernails clean.

145
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:27,175
- There's some special soap
in the back if you--

146
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,611
- is this what you want
for yourself?

147
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,395
- Look, I happen
to like my life.

148
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,788
- Yeah, well,
whatever works for you.

149
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,094
- Yeah, whatever works for you,
too.

150
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,312
- When's the last time
you booked something?

151
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,271
- Whatever, man,
I've done commercials.

152
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,840
Today's ordinary burger
just can't satisfy

153
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,755
the modern-day black man.

154
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:45,672
We likes our food to have
that extra large flavor, baby.

00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,456
That's why,

are catering Charli's wedding.

dip that in the sauce.

for yourself, bubba.

bit more ice.

00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,581
but I go back and forth
from the house to the city

339
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:03,757
to go to auditions,
have you even considered that?

340
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,368
- Did you even consider that
I have been cooking meals

341
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,936
for 200 people on a 4-eye stove

342
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,112
ever since
your father and I divorced?

343
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:13,332
- What am I supposed to do?

344
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:19,250
- [Sighs] Look, honey, baby,
this is our place.

345
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,644
Phil and I want a place
for ourselves.

346
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,560
So we can start building
some new memories.

347
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:34,004
- [Laughs] Yeah.

348
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:37,268
Yeah, o-ho! You almost got me,
man, you're a funny dude.

349
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,922
This is--
this is a joke, right?

350
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:42,012
This is a joke, you--you--you--
I was late to work today, mom,

351
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,710
that's why,
'cause I was late to work,

352
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:45,102
you're trying to teach me
a lesson,

353
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,800
well the lesson's learnt, man,
I'm a changed man.

354
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:49,585
I will be on time, Jack,
right on the dot.

355
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,371
Every day. I'm a changed man,
you know, you can--

356
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,807
guarantee that,
you've got my word,

357
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,811
scout's honor, pinky swear,
bet on black.

358
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:01,118
You know what they say, that
home black, I saw that on--

359
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,382
on soul train.

360
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:10,780
You guys--
you guys are serious.

361
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:15,219
- You ever think about, uh--
getting your own place?

362
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:20,268
- Ma?
- You need to be near the city
and we don't.

363
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:23,837
Maybe you ought to think about
getting a place closer.

364
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,100
- Yeah.

365
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,451
- This is not the night
to hear this.

366
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,888
- Baby, there's just no
perfect time for some things.

367
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,761
Sometimes you have just got
to do what you've got to do.

368
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:37,981
Sometimes--
- sometimes seems like every
time for me.

369
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:41,637
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

370
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,118
- Apartment hunting.

371
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:52,431
- He's just hard-headed,
you know, like I used to be.

372
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,911
- Mm-hm, I know you're
hard headed,

373
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:57,218
but I thought bones were
supposed to get softer

374
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,437
as you got older.

375
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,484
- [Laughs]
Now that's funny.

376
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,226
You know, baby,
my bones are good.

377
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,534
- Aaah!
- [Laughs] Come here.

378
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,456
- Hi.

379
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,675
- Oh.
- Mm.

380
00:24:21,024 --> 00:24:23,853
Mm.

381
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:26,900
What did you think of the
rehearsal?

382
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,945
- If the wedding goes as smooth
as the rehearsal

383
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:31,208
I'll be more than happy.

384
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:33,646
I'm a little nervous about
the floral arrangements, though.

385
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,125
I might check that out tomorrow.

386
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:36,866
- What's up with that?
- I don't know,

387
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,825
I'm just unsure
and I didn't wanna settle.

388
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,348
- Settle?

389
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,873
My wife will never
have to settle about anything.

390
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,832
- Future wife.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

391
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,964
Future wife. Now didn't the
brochure guarantee

392
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,010
100% customer satisfaction?
- Yes.

393
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:53,448
- Yes, it did, so now, if
they didn't provide that, then--

394
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,669
- oh, god, Johnnie Cochran,
wait a second.

395
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:59,976
- What?
- Slow down.

396
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,456
What did I say?

397
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,719
- You said you'd handle it
tomorrow.

398
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,982
- And what am I gonna do?

399
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,593
- You're gonna handle it
tomorrow.

400
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:08,855
- Ok, good.
- The defense rests.

401
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:12,728
- Very good.
- What?

402
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,338
- You smell like garlic,
it's awful.

403
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,384
- Garlic?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:18,386
- Garlic is the flavor of love,
you ain't know?

405
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,606
- Says who?

406
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,001
- Says the man who loves you
dearly.

407
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:27,787
- Oh, god, no,
you smell like garlic.

408
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,529
That's awful.
- Come here, come here, come
here.

409
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,401
- Oh!
No, don't tickle, don't tickle.

410
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,708
- I'm tickling!

411
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,927
[Both laughing]

412
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,933
[Laughter]

413
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:47,110
- Charli: Aaah, the food!
- Oh! Ow!

414
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,983
- My masterpiece.
I got it, I got it.

415
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,854
It's ok.
- God!

416
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,378
- It's ok. Ok.

417
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,033
It's still ok, baby.
- Good.

418
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,775
- Whoo! Ok.

419
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,343
- Are you all right?

420
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:05,520
- You're not the first guy
that's tickled me, you know?

421
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,436
- You're talking about
after the accident?

422
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:11,526
- Oh?
Yeah, it was nothing,

423
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,310
it was nothing, honestly.

424
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:14,834
- Nothing?
Baby, you were involved

425
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:18,446
in a hit and run.

426
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:22,537
- I know,
he'll track them down.

427
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,200
[Doorbell]

428
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:41,861
[Whispers] What are you
doing here?

429
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:43,123
- How you gonna marry this dude
over me?

430
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:46,474
- Sh. We haven't spoken
in over three years.

431
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,128
You don't get to ask why.
- Why not?

432
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,303
- Because you don't.
- Why is that?

433
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:51,044
- You just don't, ok?

434
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,394
- In case you forgot, Charli,
you're the one that broke up
with me.

435
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,570
That's why we haven't spoken
in, like, over three years.

436
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,093
- If you would have been there
for me

437
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:59,400
we'd be having a different
conversation right now,

438
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:01,924
but you weren't.

439
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:07,321
I just wanna talk,
it's too late to even do that?

440
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:09,366
- Too late.

441
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,760
I question your sanity
sometimes, you know that?

442
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:14,371
- Yeah, well, my straitjacket's
on the back of the bike.

443
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,852
- Huh! Really funny.

444
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:19,899
- Ed? Hey, big guy,
what's going on, man?

445
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,161
- What's up?
- Um--

446
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,293
would you believe, I managed
to get the plates

447
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,991
on those kids after all?

448
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,079
I saw them on my way
home from work,

449
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,950
followed them
for, like, 2 miles.

450
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:31,606
- Wow, on that bike?
- [Charli scoffs]

451
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,348
- Yeah. It's got ten speeds.
- Oh.

452
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:38,657
- Well, your card came in handy
after all.

453
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,615
- Um, thanks, but you know,

454
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,225
this could have waited till the
morning, man, it's 11 o'clock,
you know?

455
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,489
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, this is,
uh, it's kinda urgent.

456
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:46,969
- And well, we were just about
to have dinner

457
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:50,364
so if you don't mind--
- no, i--i don't mind,

458
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,148
actually i'm--
I am a little bit thirsty

459
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,108
after the whole bike ordeal.

460
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,850
Wouldn't mind a little
sip of something.

461
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,374
I could hold you for negligence,
if you don't, you know that.

462
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,419
- Hey.
- All right?

463
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,552
- All right, come on, man. Come
on. I'll get you something.

464
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,032
- Thank you.
- Come on. All right?

465
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,295
- Oh, yeah. Excuse me.

466
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:13,517
- So let me, uh--
put some pants on, right?

467
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,084
What?

468
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,131
Ed: Bam!
[Laughs]

469
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:20,481
- Is that um,
that's takeout?

470
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:23,745
- Oh, come on, all home-made,
strictly fresh,

471
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,399
ain't that right, Charli?
- Yes.

472
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,270
- That's right.
- I can tell this is probably
pretty good,

473
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,838
you know, I know a little thing
or two about fine cuisine.

474
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:33,102
First of all, because
I love to eat

475
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,583
and secondly, because my mother
is a caterer.

476
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:39,718
- [Laughs] Fine cuisine.
Like it.

477
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,503
- You know what, you should have
her cater your wedding.

478
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:44,070
- No, well, that's
her department, you know,

479
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:45,288
we already got somebody,
right, baby?

480
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:50,946
- Yeah, yeah, we do.
- Hmm, that's too bad.

481
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,080
Ah, let's eat.

482
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:02,349
- Your nails are horrendous.
- Thank you.

483
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,570
You must be one hell
of an attorney, ed.

484
00:29:06,614 --> 00:29:10,618
To get her hand in marriage.
What'd you do, sue her for it?

485
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,446
[Both laugh]

486
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,013
Yeah. That's a tough hand to
keep, brother,

487
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:15,884
that's a tough hand to keep.

488
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:18,365
- Do you two know each other?

489
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:24,023
- Oh, yeah, no doubt.
No doubt, man.

490
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,851
- Why didn't you tell me?

491
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,854
- She--she didn't tell you?
- I was gonna tell you

492
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,813
but the door rang and--
- what were you gonna say?

493
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,946
- The truth.
- I doubt that.

494
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,469
- What is the truth?
- Charli: Nothing.

495
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,123
- Aah. Well, now, the truth--

496
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,255
- nothing special, trust me.
- Let me tell the brother

497
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:40,953
the truth, he wants
to know the truth.

498
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,912
The truth is, that, you know,
at one point in time

499
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:46,393
Charli was the most
important thing in my life, man.

500
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:49,396
When we were kids growing up.
Then you know,

501
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,267
as friends do,
we drifted apart

502
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:56,795
things happen, life changes,
blase, blah.

503
00:29:56,838 --> 00:30:02,017
- I had this friend, Darlene,
beautiful girl, she was great,

504
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,019
she moved away, I was young.
- Cool: She was hot?

505
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:06,065
- She was fine.
[Laughs]

506
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:08,415
Now baby,
I just had a moment,

507
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,721
can't a brother have a moment?
You know what I'm saying.

508
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:14,073
- Cool: I understand what you
mean though, man, 'cause
Charli--

509
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:16,597
whoo-hoo!
- Come on, Charli is the best.

510
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,556
- Cool: Charli, Charli, Charli.
[Laughs]

511
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,037
Charli's something else, man.
[Laughs]

512
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:24,997
- What?

513
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,608
What? What? What?

514
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,263
- Well, listen, if I had
one negative thing

515
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:32,961
to say about Charli, this has
just popped into my head now.

516
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,834
Is that, you know,
as much as she likes

517
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,661
to face problems head-on,

518
00:30:37,705 --> 00:30:40,360
she tends to skirt the issue
when it comes to the big
problems.

519
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,971
- And you're the--
you're the most qualified person

520
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:45,931
to talk about that?

521
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,107
- Baby, ok, I will say
one thing.

522
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:52,111
That, sometimes--right?

523
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,200
Well, we know you're
a great psychologist, right,

524
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,636
that's in no dispute.

525
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,945
But sometimes you don't always
apply your own analysis

526
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:02,077
to yourself.

527
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,166
- And you're the most qualified
person to talk about that?

528
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,866
- It's true, it's true.
- Hey, you know what I mean?

529
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,825
- Hey!
- Come on, man, now.

530
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,047
- Hey, how about--how about that
one guy you were engaged to?

531
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,919
What was his name, uh, Reginald,
I believe?

532
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:18,920
- Charli: What about him?

533
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:20,574
- The bullshit actor dude.

534
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:24,317
- He's a loser.
- A--a loser?

535
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,276
[Stammers] Was he that bad?

536
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,191
- Well, from what I hear.
- You know what,

537
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:31,367
I don't even remember anymore.

538
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:33,195
- Mmm, I don't know, Charli,

539
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,546
you called it off with him about
a month before the wedding,
right?

540
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,940
He was taking you home from
school and by the time

541
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,986
he got to the end of the
driveway, everything was over.

542
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:44,293
The marriage, the wedding,
the relationship, everything.

543
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:50,082
What was supposed to be
the beginning became the end.

544
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:54,956
Cause that's what they had
told me at the gas station.

545
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,960
- Well, you know, it was the end
of the road.

546
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:02,094
- That's right.
And the start of another.

547
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,923
- Yes.
- Come here, you.

548
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:09,014
- Mmm. Mm!

549
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,972
- That's some bullshit, Charli.

550
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,887
I mean, I'm sorry, but it is.

551
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,107
It's some bullshit.
You don't do that to people.

552
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,065
Sorry, man, but I'm just
not in the business

553
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,806
of sugar-coating the truth.

554
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,374
- No, no, you're in the business
of--of what?

555
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:22,853
Ignoring the truth.

556
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,681
- Well I'm in the business
of trying to start the dinner.

557
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:26,945
You know can we, can we,
ask a blessing or something?

558
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,904
- Yes.
- You know, just whatever we
need to do, let's get to eat.

559
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:34,169
- How about blessing the fact
that is two black people in
love.

560
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,389
Black love, I love it,
it just warms my heart.

561
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:39,609
- All right, well, to love.

562
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,524
- To Charli.

563
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:45,137
- And to you.
- And to you.

564
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,616
- Hey, why not?

565
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,009
- My brother that smells
like gasoline

566
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,446
can still drawing board me.
[Laughs]

567
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,971
- Hey, check it out, I'm gonna
skedaddle, man, you know.

568
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,102
- What are you talking about?
Uh-uh.

569
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:55,930
- You haven't even eaten.
- Nah,

570
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,105
- I gotta peddle my way home.
- Ed: No.

571
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,020
- Baby, if he has to go,
he has things to do,

572
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:01,805
we have to go to bed, we have
so many things to do tomorrow.

573
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,025
- It's days before the wedding.
- It's fine, yeah, sure,

574
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:06,027
if you've gotta go, bro,
I understand.
- All right, thanks, man.

575
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,377
Hey, do me a favor, man.
- What's that?

576
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,900
- Take care of this
precious woman.

577
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:15,036
- Oh, I certainly will.
She is my best friend.

578
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:21,173
- Always a pleasure.

579
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,523
- I'll show you out.
- All right, man.

580
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,368
I hate you sometimes, man.

581
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:39,033
♪ Can't nobody love you
like I'm loving you, baby ♪

582
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:45,474
♪ 'cause they don't know how
to love you like I do ♪

583
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:48,347

584
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:53,047

- [Grunts]

585
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:57,225
- You've been waking up to
this song for three years now.

586
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,706
Where'd you go last night?

587
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:07,757
I'd tell you not to do it
but I know who I'm talking to.

588
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,890
- Hey?
- Mmm?

589
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,979
- Treat my client
with some respect?

590
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,423
Bubba!
- Hey, hey, I'm up.

591
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:25,297
I'm up. I'm going to work.

592
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,952
- I love you, son.
- I love you too.

593
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:37,047
Yeah. You love me so much,
you kick me up out the house.

594
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:39,137
I don't need that love.

595
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:23,181
You're the most beautiful woman
in the world, you know that?

596
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,057
I love your lips, your eyes,
your ears.

597
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,932
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

598
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,476
- Is the car ready yet?
- Uh, yeah.

599
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,781
My boy over at Stan's

600
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,001
hooked the door up for me
from a junk yard.

601
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:04,744
- $500 job.
- $500?

602
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,486
- It's complicated stuff.
- When's it getting picked up?

603
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:09,836
- Uh, this attorney called me
about it this morning.

604
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,404
Made a point of telling me
he practiced law.

605
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,885
- Better make it 600.
- Yeah.

606
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:17,278
I'm gonna get breakfast,
you good?

607
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:20,586
- No, I'm straight, man, thanks.
- All right.

608
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:22,022
- I'll catch you later.
- Mm-hm.

609
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:25,155
- Don't touch the car, right?
- That's your job.

610
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,375
- Yeah, you know.

611
00:37:50,006 --> 00:37:54,837
- Cool, what you doing?
Wh--what you doing?

612
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,057
Get out the car.
You know, you work,

613
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,016
you can have a car like that
you can sit in all day long.

614
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,670
- You're tired?
- No, I was just--

615
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,498
- get out the car.

616
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,067
- Cool: Fill her up?

617
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,070
- Customer: No, no.
$5, regular.

618
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,615
- What's up? How you doing?
- I'm all right, how you doing?

619
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,095
- I'm chilling.

620
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,488
- Uh, you did some great work
on the car, dude.

621
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,011
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

622
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:40,187
I got no money for gas though,
your work was expensive.

623
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,972
- I hooked you up, new shocks,
I gave you--

624
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:47,063
your brakes were kind of
sticking. I gave you some--

625
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:54,244
- yeah, good, how you doing?
- Yeah, I'm pretty good.

626
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:55,507
- Your girl good?
- Yeah.

627
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,030
- Tell her I said hey.
- I will.

628
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:58,379
- She's cute, man.
- Yeah.

629
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,642
- You guys look good together.

630
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,779
- All right.
- Customer: It's all there.

631
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:10,435
- Cool: 16.59?

632
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,741
- It's $5.
- You said fill her up.
It's 16.59.

633
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:13,786
- I didn't say fill her up.

634
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:14,787
- Yeah, that's what you said,
man.

635
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,093
- I didn't say fill it up.

636
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,399
- I wouldn't have filled
your tank if you didn't say
fill her up.

637
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:19,705
- Yeah, you take it back out,
then. I said $5.

638
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:21,010
- Why would I fill it up
if you didn't say that?

639
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,098
- Yeah, why you fill it up
if I didn't say that?

640
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:24,057
- 'Cause you said--
- I ain't say that.

641
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,928
- You said that, man.
- Yo, yo, yo.

642
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,452
- This guy crazy,
this guy crazy.

643
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:28,670
Don't worry about it,
I got you.

644
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:30,280
You just tell your friends
where to come

645
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:32,108
to get their car smoothed out,
all right?
- I'll tell 'em.

646
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,849
Take it easy, man,
good to see you.

647
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,416
- All right, man.

648
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,636
- Hey, man, I need you
to cover for me again.

649
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,422
- All I do is cover for you, no.
- Come on, man,
I cover for you too.

650
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,903
Look, what do you think Phil
will be more upset about,

651
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,905
me coming in late,
or you overcharging customers

652
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:47,385
for the cars you joyride in?

653
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,822
One's illegal, one's not.
- I got my reasons.

654
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:51,954
- You have reasons
for overcharging your customers?

655
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:53,869
- Yeah.

656
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,480
- What are these reasons, man?
What do you need money for?

657
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,220
- What? What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

658
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:58,918
- I'm working on something.
- What?

659
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:01,181
What are you working on?

660
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,358
- When will you be back?

661
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,100
- I'll be in and out all day.
- No, man,
you work until we close.

662
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,537
Listen,
I will cover you for an hour.

663
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,365
- No, no, no, no, no.
I need more time than that.

664
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,323
- Well, no.
- Please, listen.

665
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:15,717
You said you wanted to know
who the real cool is, right?

666
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,545
- That was yesterday, today,
I'm all right.

667
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:19,286
- You know whose car that is
in the garage?

668
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:22,768
- Which one?
- The only car in the garage,
stupid, the accord.

669
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:25,031
- I'll know when they bring it
back in for more work.

670
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:28,164
- It's Charli's.
- Charli Reynolds?

671
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:35,389
- Charli from high school?
- Yeah, college too.

672
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,827
- Charli, your ex-fiancee.
- Yes, yes.

673
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,568
That attorney that you spoke to
earlier today,

674
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,657
come the end of the day
on Saturday,

675
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:43,832
her new husband.

676
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:48,097
- Damn, that's tomorrow.
- I know this.

677
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,361
- Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. Wait.

678
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:54,016
So you want me to work for you
so you can go out

679
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,845
and live some love fantasy
you've got planned in your head?

680
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:59,195
Look around you, bro,
this ain't--
there ain't no Bridges here.

681
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,895
This ain't Madison county.
This is essex county, bro.

682
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,984
- Stop calling me bro, homeboy
and all that other stuff.

683
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:06,507
Man, I'm getting tired of it.

684
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,770
- You still love her?

685
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,036
Listen, man, regardless,
I ain't working for you all day.

686
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,125
I'm sorry, dawg,
that's outlandish,

687
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:19,738
- that's preposterous.
- What?

688
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,653
Come on, man, I got some
auditions I gotta go to too.

689
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:23,393
- There comes a time
in every man's life

690
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,395
when he has to put
his foot down.

691
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:30,009
This is that time,
I am that man.

692
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,013
Sorry.

693
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:37,059
- I'll tell Phil right now
that you grease the customers.

694
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,408
- Right now.
- I told you, man,

695
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:41,107
- I got my reasons.
- What are these reasons?

696
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,807
- Just--
give me the damn bank.

697
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:49,463
- My man, yes,
a little advance on my paycheck.

698
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,074
Phil said it was cool
and it can all go to you--

699
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:53,554
- all right, all right,
all right.

700
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,121
- If you just hold me down.
- All right, all right.

701
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:57,384
- Thanks a lot, man. God bless.

702
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:22,061
Come on,
let me see my balance.

703
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,367
80 bucks.

704
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:26,631
What? Man!

705
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:28,894
I know I put a check-- damn!

706
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:35,422
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hold up. Damn!

707
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,380
Aah!

708
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,041
[Heavy breathing]

709
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:56,051
[Musical tone]

710
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:06,975
- Reginald coolidge.

711
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,412
Reginald coolidge?

712
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:19,031
Ok, we now have
Reginald coolidge.

713
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:20,902
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.

714
00:43:20,946 --> 00:43:24,906
- All right, thank you. Leave
that there, please.

715
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,866
- Ok, sit down.

716
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,352
- Um, we decided to call you in
after looking at your reel.

717
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:40,139
He wants an unknown
and you are that.

718
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:44,926
I mean, I don't remember
seeing you in anything.

719
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,580
- Uh, thank you.

720
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,495
- Thank me? For what?

721
00:43:48,538 --> 00:43:52,281
- You know, for having me in
despite my unknownness.

722
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,980
- You're welcome.
Go ahead.

723
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,069
- Mr. Big daddy burger.

724
00:43:57,112 --> 00:43:59,854
- Hey, it ain't
your daddy's burger.

725
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:01,856
You know,
because that's what they say.

726
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,337
I'm the spokesperson
for their campaign.

727
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,209
- That's what it is, I knew
I know you from somewhere.

728
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,516
- You know, "hey, big daddy."
- Yeah.

729
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:10,952
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

730
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:14,869
I was actually, um, the female
lead in the commercial

731
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,871
with him, but, uh--he s good.

732
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,612
- You act?
- Well, I did,

733
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,268
it was a while ago.
- Excuse me.

734
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:24,792
- Anyway, I don't know how much
you know about what we're doing,

735
00:44:24,836 --> 00:44:27,621
but we're not gonna burn
one frame of film

736
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,972
on any of that typical black
bullshit that they're doing.

737
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:35,107
- So uh, what is it about?
- It's a comedy, a black comedy.

738
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,152
About what would happen
if black people

739
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:39,720
got reparations
for slavery.

740
00:44:39,764 --> 00:44:41,591
- Doesn't sound funny to me
at all.

741
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,202
- And that's the point.

742
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:44,377
Our goal here is to keep
drug dealer

743
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,074
off the top of a lot of resumes.

744
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:47,380
Have you ever played
a drug dealer?

745
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,556
- Uh, ye--a street pharmacist.

746
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,732
- Look, let me paint the
picture.

747
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:57,085
A fictitious town in Virginia,
new hope.

748
00:44:57,129 --> 00:45:00,045
A black town, and nobody has
any real problems.

749
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,917
There aren't any class issues
and everything you need

750
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:04,527
is at the general store.

751
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:06,704
New hope was founded
during a reconstruction.

752
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:10,925
On land purchased by
several families of free men.

753
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,232
These families happen to be
direct lineage

754
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:16,888
to the original 23 slaves
brought to jamestown, Virginia

755
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,978
in the year 1619.

756
00:45:20,021 --> 00:45:23,416
Today, these families get
reparations checks

757
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:26,071
of a very significant amount.

758
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,290
Problem is, they can't tell
anybody that they got 'em

759
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:30,292
or it all falls apart.

760
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:38,561
- So what happens?
- What about US.

761
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:41,216
It's the title.

762
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,001
So what about you?

763
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,524
- So you don't want me
to read the lines?

764
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,787
- Just wanna hear a little bit
about you.

765
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:49,834
- Uh, my story. Here we go.

766
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:52,140
Hwaah!

767
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,536
Here we go.

768
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:02,455
Well, I am 28 years old,
six foot one inches tall.

769
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:05,675
And I'm black.

770
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:11,986
Whatever the hell that means.
Um, I live at home with my mom

771
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,034
and her boyfriend
who I wish she never had.

772
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:17,775
I go on auditions
every day of the week.

773
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:19,689
If I'm lucky.

774
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:22,649
If I'm not auditioning
for a killer or a rapist

775
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:25,260
or something like that,
I'm even luckier.

776
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:26,958
Ah, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da--

777
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:30,004
oh, until this morning,
I rode the same bike

778
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:32,441
that I had on my paper route
17 years ago,

779
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:34,052
I rode it every day.

780
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:35,836
Then it got stolen.
That's kind wack.

781
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,969
I don't even know why
I'm telling you that. Uh--

782
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:40,014
let's see what else, I mean,

783
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:42,495
even though there's the big
stereotype and everything,

784
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,758
I've gotta admit,
I love me some chicken,

785
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,151
fried chicken,
that's my favorite.

786
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:50,764
It tastes so good.
Don't you agree?

787
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,855
Uh, something else,

788
00:46:54,899 --> 00:47:00,078
that, uh--
that pretty much, uh-- scene.

789
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:03,298
- That's it?
- [Laughs]

790
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:06,084
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's it, yeah.

791
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:09,000
- You told US how tall you are,
how old you are,

792
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,305
where you live,

793
00:47:10,349 --> 00:47:13,961
you're black, you're 28,
you like fried chicken.

794
00:47:14,005 --> 00:47:15,702
Who are you?

795
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,882
Uh--

796
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:34,112
Call in our next actor.

797
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:35,765
- You know, there's no one else
out there. It's lunch time.

798
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:38,899
So if there's something
you wanted to add maybe we can--

799
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:42,250
- he's done, he's done.
The audition is over.

800
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:44,470
- Well, I'm sorry,
what did I do?

801
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:47,212
- You didn't do anything at all.
- Woman: You know what I'd like?

802
00:47:47,255 --> 00:47:49,779
One of those Cuban sandwiches
from downstairs.

803
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:51,216
- Man: I thought you gave up
the pork?

804
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:52,870
- Woman: Oh, no, no, no,
not at all.

805
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:54,654
- Man: Where's lunch?
- Young woman: I'll call it in.

806
00:47:54,697 --> 00:47:57,091
The regular, big daddy burger?
- Man: Uh, yeah, thank you.

807
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:58,092
Big daddy burger please.

808
00:47:58,136 --> 00:47:59,137
When actors like this,

809
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:02,053
they come in here,
no preparation--

810
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:03,532
- young woman: Yes, I'd like to
make an order.

811
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:06,013
- Don't know what they're doing,
don't know who they are.

812
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:07,101
- Young woman: One big daddy
burger.

813
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:08,494
- Woman: Yeah, I think we
should--

814
00:48:08,537 --> 00:48:12,280
- man: The audition's over.
- Woman: Yeah.

815
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,111
Thank you.

816
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:30,951
Ok, first off,

817
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:35,782
you can't pull a gun
on a person, all right?

818
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:36,957
Fake or not.

819
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:39,742
- They said they wanted black.

820
00:48:39,786 --> 00:48:41,005
You know what,
forget about that.

821
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:42,354
Why don't you get a chair
in this office?

822
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,269
- I have a chair in this place.

823
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:45,966
My clients are supposed to be
out booking jobs

824
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,795
and making money, you're the
only one who comes in here

825
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:51,885
and complains about standing.
- Yeah. I wonder why?

826
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,757
- You know what, mister,
you can check that attitude.

827
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,804
I am busting my neck for you.

828
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:59,327
- You have to read
some of these things

829
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:01,025
that these people have me doing.

830
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:03,941
- That's not my problem,
what they have you doing.

831
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:07,031
If you have a problem with
what they have you doing,

832
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,033
then get some brothers
to write a script

833
00:49:09,076 --> 00:49:10,382
or you write a script.

834
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:13,907
That's not my job.

835
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,344
- Hey, something has to give.
- And you know what it is?

836
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:19,260
You. You wanna make it
all the way to the top,

837
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:20,870
I'll tell you what,

838
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:23,438
you gotta take a few shorts
along the way.

839
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:26,224
You gotta lose a couple battles
to win the war, all right?

840
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:29,053
So you play a few rapists.
So you--

841
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:33,579
you play a few drug dealers,
you play some basketball,

842
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,973
you play some football.

843
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:42,196
Come on, you be the best damn
stereotype you know how to be.

844
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,766
- There are certain things
I just can't do.

845
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:48,898
- Won't do. That's all right.

846
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:50,378
That's all right. You know why?

847
00:49:50,422 --> 00:49:53,729
'Cause they're hiring
accountants at h&r block.

848
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:57,429
Tax season is coming up,
here, want an application?

849
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:01,041
- Why do you even have this,
man?

850
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,087
- Because as long as
you're standing there,

851
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,350
I need to supplement my income.

852
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:13,184
- How'd the audition go today?

853
00:50:13,227 --> 00:50:16,796
- Fuck Pete chatmon.
- Uhhh.

854
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:19,625
That good, huh?
You wanna talk about it?

855
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:21,279
- No.

856
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:28,895
Thank you.
- For what?

857
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:32,420
- For standing by me.

858
00:50:32,464 --> 00:50:35,380
- Go figure. You know,

859
00:50:35,423 --> 00:50:41,168
despite the many asshole-ish
properties in your personality,

860
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:44,084
there's something about you
I find likeable.

861
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:46,347
Here,

862
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:50,090
some new auditions.

863
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:52,353
If you can do them.

864
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:55,052
- Hey, just two-way me if
anything happens with anything.

865
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:57,706
- Mm-hm.
Ciao, baby.

866
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,795
- Yeah, bye.

867
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,585
- Pete chatmon, please.

868
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:12,069
Petey, hi,
hey, Cole Carter here.

869
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:15,028
Yeah, how's it going?

870
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,031
No,
just got back from Sundance.

871
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,077
Working on my tan. Uh-huh.

872
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,296
[Laughs]

873
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:28,955
- Man: Put on your helmet.
Let's play.

874
00:51:28,998 --> 00:51:32,001
- [Shouts]

875
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:33,307
- You're running down the field,
they're coming after you,

876
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:35,222
they're tackling left,
they're tackling right

877
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:37,485
but you're too fancy for them.

878
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:41,272
Sweet feet, that's it,
that's it,

879
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:43,274
getting jiggy, getting jiggy.

880
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:48,061
Now, basketball.
What have you got?

881
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:53,153
You call yourself a black man?
Dribble that damn ball.

882
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,502
Round and round,

883
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:59,638
do it like curly.
LeBron James, magnificent.

884
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,085
Haaah!

885
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:18,135
- Man: Go ahead now, rape her.

886
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:24,663
- Cool: Do what?
Hey, no, I will not calm down.

887
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:28,232
Hey, hooligan,
get your hands off me.

888
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,495
This is ridiculous.

889
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,022
- I'm the murderer, right?

890
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:54,736
- Pete: Who are you?
- Cole: You be the best

891
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,000
damn stereotype
you know how to be.

892
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:03,832
- Cool's mom: We're moving.
- Phil: Do you ever think about
getting your own place?

893
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:05,965
- Pete: The audition's over.

894
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:11,884
- [Charli laughing]
- Try to focus.

895
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:14,974
Look, just, do this,
do this. Hwaah!

896
00:53:15,017 --> 00:53:17,106
- Ok, ok.
- Hwaah!

897
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,544
- Charli: Are you here for me?

898
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:22,329
I'm here for you.

899
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:24,723
You're gonna make it.

900
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:29,902
"We've been together
for quite some time now.

901
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:34,080
"Long enough to start thinking
about things--

902
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:36,517
"the big things."
Is this for a soap opera?

903
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:38,563
- Come on. I don't do soaps.
It's a pilot.

904
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:39,868
- Oh?
- Continue.

905
00:53:39,912 --> 00:53:42,088
Ok.

906
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:45,004
"You've been there for me
since the beginning.

907
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:47,876
"I wanna be here for you
until the end."

908
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,139
- "I love you so much."

909
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:01,368
- You're gonna do great things.

910
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:03,892
[Cole laughing]

911
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:05,285
- Cool: Bullshit actor dude.

912
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:09,028
- You're gonna make it, cool.

913
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:11,857
I just don't know if
it's with me.

914
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,076
Or with yourself.

915
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:19,081
"I love how your eyebrows serve
as a perfect umbrella

916
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,692
"to your brown eyes.

917
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:24,304
"I love all five feet
seven inches of you

918
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:28,047
"and how your brown and
turquoise sweat pants

919
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,616
"paint the perfect silhouette
around a work of art.

920
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:33,792
"On down to the brown shoes,

921
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:37,099
"and don't let me forget
the--the green tank top."

922
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:43,845
Did you write this?
- What?

923
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:48,763
Let me see that.
- I just--oh, damn!

924
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:51,766
Look, I gave you my copy
and then you--
- baby, what--

925
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,246
- why are you doing that, no,
we'll read.

926
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:57,946
I promise I'll be--
I'll do it better.

927
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,208
What are you--
what are you doing?

928
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:03,387
- Will you marry me?
- Are you serious?

929
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,389
- I'm serious,
will you marry me?

930
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:07,739
Be my wife?

931
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:12,134
[- Charli laughs]
Oh, my god.

932
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:13,397
- Are you smiling because
you're gonna say yes

933
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,007
or you smiling because you don't
want to--

934
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,443
- yes! Yes!
- Thank you,

935
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:18,358
that's what I wanna hear,
let me get your finger.

936
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,055
- Oh, my god.

937
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:21,753
- Cool: It's only the beginning,
I promise you,

938
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:24,103
I'll get you a better ring.

939
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,020
- Oh, my god.

940
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,996
Hey?

941
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,651
- Again?
- I can't stay away
from my favorite lady.

942
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,045
- Don't come by my house
anymore, ok?

943
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:57,397
- My life is not your movie set.
- You're right, you're so right.

944
00:55:57,441 --> 00:56:00,748
I apologize. Most likely,
it won't happen again.

945
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:02,924
- Oh!

946
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:05,797
- I see you had the chef
pick up the car?

947
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,712
- No, he had some cases
to take care of

948
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:10,323
so I went and picked it up
from Derrick.

949
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,891
For some reason,
ed liked you, so--

950
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:15,502
- oh, yeah? That would
probably be the charm.

951
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:19,463
'Cause I'm a real charming guy,
a lot of people say that.

952
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:22,379
Of course I'd prefer if
the charm worked on you.

953
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:26,034
- Did you really get
the license plates?

954
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:31,388
- Oh, hm-- the--the plates?
- The plates, cool?

955
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,914
- Oh. Oh!

956
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:38,046
- Some things never change.
- Yeah.

957
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,574
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are--
what are you doing?

958
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:44,879
- Yeah, I need a ride to work.

959
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:47,012
- How did you get here?
- I walked.

960
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:48,535
- Well, then walk back.

961
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:51,059
- Come on, Charli, these--
these ain't my walking shoes.

962
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:53,975
They're my dancing shoes.

963
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,064
- Get in.

964
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,720
- Girl, let me ask you
a question.

965
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:02,941
- What?
- No, never mind, forget it.

966
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:05,987
- That's so typical of you.
I know your game.

967
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:08,076
Play the card,
put it on the table.

968
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,471
- No, no, no, no, talking about
what ed has over me

969
00:57:11,515 --> 00:57:14,909
is not my idea of witty banter
or--or stimulating conversation.

970
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:17,172
I'll take the card back,
forget it.

971
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:19,436
- Really?

972
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:24,136
Yes, that's just so typical,
that's so you, you know?

973
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:26,181
You make the rules
and only you can break them.

974
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:30,969
Hypocrisy at its finest.
Go ahead, just say it.

975
00:57:31,012 --> 00:57:32,927
- No, let's move on
to something else, man.

976
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:36,975
You know, you look beautiful
today, let's talk about that.
- Fuck off.

977
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:39,238
- [Laughs]

978
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:54,601
- Reggie, this may be your last
chance to say anything to me.

979
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,822
Just say it, Reggie.

980
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:04,655
- The only reason why I knew
it was you the other day

981
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:09,094
was 'cause of your eyes,
not 'cause of your smile.

982
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,012
- You're definitely
getting better.

983
00:58:14,055 --> 00:58:17,232
- What?
I'm serious, this is not an act.

984
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:25,719
- I'm stressed, ok?
I mean, I'm planning a wedding.

985
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:31,986
I'll be the happiest woman
when tomorrow,
I walk down that aisle,

986
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:36,556
I meet ed down there
and I say, "I do," ok?

987
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,212
- Planning? You sure?
Show--show me some planning?

988
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,214
Let me see
your to do list, Charli.

989
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:43,868
Where's the Microsoft outlook?

990
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:45,173
Don't you got a BlackBerry
or something like that?

991
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,915
How about a post-it note,
for god's sake?

992
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,830
We are chilling on the side
of the road

993
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:51,876
in a car
that has just stopped.

994
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:54,226
What exactly
are you planning here?

995
00:58:57,011 --> 00:59:00,275
- My mother's doing
all the planning so--

996
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,062
- oh, boy, everybody loves
big momma.

997
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:05,672
- What is that about?

998
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:08,936
- Come on, you know
she never liked me.

999
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,592
- You're right. She's good
with that kind of stuff.

1000
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,115
- Ha ha ha.

1001
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:20,295
- There's not much left to do
anyway.

1002
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:25,300
Just double check on the flowers
and show up, that's it.

1003
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:28,869
- Show up to marry
the wrong guy, if you ask me.

1004
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:32,003
If you don't see that, I don't
know what the fuck is wrong with
you, Charli. Damn.

1005
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:33,308
- You know what, Reggie,
you know,

1006
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:35,180
there's no need for you
to be disrespecting me.

1007
00:59:35,223 --> 00:59:36,442
Just get out of the car.
Get out of the car.
- Come--

1008
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:37,791
- it was a bad idea, get out.

1009
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:39,619
- Come on, Charli.
- Reggie, get out.

1010
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,621
- You know, fine, fine, fine,
I'm going, I'm going.

1011
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,841
You know, you wanna go home to
your little fake-ass
thurgood Marshall,

1012
00:59:43,884 --> 00:59:45,843
you know, do that, he doesn't
know you like I do anyway.

1013
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,496
Man, you're being stupid.
- Fine!

1014
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,368
- Ow!
- Then that's what I am.
Get out of my car.

1015
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:51,675
- Well, I am going.
- I can't fucking take
your shit anymore.

1016
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,024
- I ain't stupid.
- Stupid!

1017
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:55,766
- So how do you get out
of this motherfucker?

1018
00:59:57,202 --> 00:59:59,421
Get some power locks.

1019
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,908
[Engine splutters]

1020
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:12,434
- Charli: Oh, come on, come on.

1021
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:14,219
[Musical tone]

1022
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:19,050
[Engine splutters]

1023
01:00:21,879 --> 01:00:24,098
[Engine splutters]

1024
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:36,589
What the f--

1025
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:46,251
I told you to leave.
- No, no I'm not going anywhere.

1026
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:47,556
Just watch out.

1027
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,384
- Why do you have to be pushing
me all the time?

1028
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:52,561
- Just--woman.

1029
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:55,260
See cause the re--
'cause this thing, when you--

1030
01:00:55,303 --> 01:01:01,919
no, but then sometimes on the
car, like this, you need to get
under--

1031
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,182
I don't know what-- I don't know
what I'm doing.

1032
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:06,401
- Of course.

1033
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:11,929
- Come on, Charli,
let me just spend

1034
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,670
this last afternoon
with you, huh?

1035
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,149
- No.

1036
01:01:15,193 --> 01:01:16,716
- Come on, look, I know
I can't have anything more.

1037
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,891
I can't possibly have
anything less

1038
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:19,240
than how it stands now.

1039
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:21,068
Come on, let me just go into
the city with you

1040
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:23,723
and help you out with all
the wedding things
if you need it.

1041
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:24,985
- You're gonna help me
with my wedding plans?

1042
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,118
- Yeah.
I'm man enough to do that.

1043
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:28,902
You can even call big momma
and tell her

1044
01:01:28,946 --> 01:01:31,339
who helped you with everything.

1045
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,515
Look, I'm sorry about
the comment in the car.

1046
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,995
It was rude.

1047
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:42,394
- Yeah, I don't know, Reggie.
- You know me, don't you?

1048
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:46,528
- That's why I say that
I don't-- I don't know, i--

1049
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:49,749
- look, I would do a lot of
things

1050
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:53,840
but what I won't do is
disrespect your relationship.

1051
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:56,538
Unless, of course,
you ask me to.

1052
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,067
What do you say?
Jersey transit?

1053
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:14,078
[Musical tone]

1054
01:02:23,348 --> 01:02:25,829
- I can't make up my mind
about these flowers.

1055
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:29,658
- Mmm. Some may
call that a sign.

1056
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:36,622
- This is it, ok?
What do you think?

1057
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:38,842
- You really wanna know?

1058
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:42,933
I think it's really too late
to change anything, Charli.

1059
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:45,979
You gotta marry the dude.
- I'm not asking you that.

1060
01:02:46,023 --> 01:02:49,722
- No, I was just joking.
No, seriously though,

1061
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,856
I think simple is better.
Love is simple, right?

1062
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,161
- Yeah.

1063
01:02:54,205 --> 01:02:56,903
- Get your favorite color
and nothing else.

1064
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,558
- Get red.
- I love red.

1065
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:04,258
All right. Hi?

1066
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:06,304
- Hi?
- I'm driving you crazy here.

1067
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:08,262
So, ok.
- Yeah.

1068
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:10,830
- I have 75 of these setting
ordered for tomorrow, right?

1069
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:14,834
- And how is that looking?
- It looks good, but you don't.

1070
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:15,922
- Oh.
- Relax.

1071
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:18,272
Girl, come on,
you getting married.

1072
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:19,926
Jump on the broom.

1073
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,581
You two look like
such a good couple.

1074
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:24,409
Ye-- aww.

1075
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:28,543
Hey, can I get a bouquet
of those for the missus?

1076
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,896
- All right.
- Wow.

1077
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,985
Congratulations on the wedding.

1078
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:55,919
A whole lot of shopping for
three very, very, small bags.

1079
01:03:55,962 --> 01:03:58,312
Oh, I don't--i don't--
- no,

1080
01:03:58,356 --> 01:03:59,792
- you said you were man enough
to handle this.

1081
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:04,275
- Yeah, I know-- woman,
I know what I said.

1082
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,932
The roses smell good.
- You wanna go somewhere to eat?

1083
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:11,412
- No--problem.

1084
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,458
- Can you hold my bags?
- Uh--

1085
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:16,548
- do you have a choice?
- Not really.

1086
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,941
I'm looking real masculine
right now

1087
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:20,508
with these purple bags,
thank you.

1088
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:23,207
- And with the flowers too.
Anyway, come on.

1089
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:29,953
I hope you didn't mind the
street meat.

1090
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:31,215
- Street meat?

1091
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:34,348
- Yeah. You know, hot dogs,
kebabs, gyros,

1092
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:35,654
anything you get
on the street.

1093
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:38,526
Meat from the street,
street meat.

1094
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,443
A term of endearment, comes
before a little worry once you
get--

1095
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:46,708
catch a bad batch.
- It's not half as bad.

1096
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:51,017
- Mmm, what?
Street meat or me?

1097
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:54,803
- The street meat.
- Ha ha ha. Thanks.

1098
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:57,023
What is that--

1099
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:58,938
- hey, cool?
How you doing?

1100
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:02,115
- Hey? Hey!

1101
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,335
- Farrah, how you doing?
- Good.

1102
01:05:04,378 --> 01:05:06,859
- Yeah, Farrah,
this is, uh, this is Charli,

1103
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,253
Charli, this is Farrah.
- Hey.

1104
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:10,907
You're here for the callback,
right?

1105
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:14,258
- Ah, yes,
yes, I'm here for the callback.

1106
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:16,956
- You too?
- Just booked what about US.

1107
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,872
- Wow, hey, congratulations.
That's, that's good.

1108
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,353
- Yeah. Thanks for the well
wishes.
- No, really, it's good news.

1109
01:05:22,396 --> 01:05:25,834
It's just been kind of
a crazy day, that's all.

1110
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:27,314
Check it out,
you think they still up there?

1111
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,927
- They were packing up
when I was leaving, so, well--

1112
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,934
I think I'm gonna go.

1113
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:40,719
- Hey, just--congratulations,
for real this time.

1114
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:42,982
I'm proud of you.

1115
01:05:56,343 --> 01:06:00,304
Ok, uh, look.
I have this really big audition,

1116
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:03,655
it just so happens to be boom!
Right here in this building

1117
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,265
where we're sitting in front of.

1118
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,615
I mean, I was supposed to be
here a couple of hours ago.

1119
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:10,009
- Oh, wow.

1120
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:12,707
Because of me,
you didn't get here on time?

1121
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:15,972
What? You wasted two hours
on little old me?

1122
01:06:17,669 --> 01:06:20,019
- Come on, babe.
- Don't babe me.

1123
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,890
- Now, listen, we, we were
walking down the street,

1124
01:06:21,934 --> 01:06:23,631
enjoying the street meat,
it was good, delicious,

1125
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:24,937
it was delectable, right?

1126
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,114
And then, pow!
Let's just walk into the lobby,

1127
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:29,986
we can discuss it in there.

1128
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,118
If anything, the audition
might be over.

1129
01:06:35,904 --> 01:06:37,906
- Ok.
- Yeah?

1130
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,604
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I knew you'd understand,

1131
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:41,823
that's why you're who you are.

1132
01:06:42,824 --> 01:06:44,478
I hope they're still there.

1133
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:03,671
I really need this job, Charli.

1134
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:09,938
- You blew it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1135
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:11,853
- Man, come on.
- You're kidding, right?

1136
01:07:11,897 --> 01:07:15,161
I know I'm running late, man,
I just, I ran into a couple of
things.

1137
01:07:15,205 --> 01:07:17,946
- Yeah, I see.
- No, he was--

1138
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,774
my car broke down, all right?

1139
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:22,473
And, and--he--he was just trying
to help me fix it.

1140
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:23,996
That's why he was late.

1141
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,042
- Ok.
Well, you've got the bags,

1142
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:28,696
you've got the roses,
good luck with your career.

1143
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,617
- This, this is my life, Charli,
this here is my story.

1144
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:38,619
Why are you walking away?
Don't walk away from me.

1145
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:39,968
- Why not, huh?

1146
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,144
- Just let me talk to you
for a second.

1147
01:07:41,187 --> 01:07:42,623
- You don't wanna hear
what I have to say.

1148
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:45,104
- What, are you gonna
tell me tomorrow?

1149
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:48,542
- As much as I care about
what you're going through,

1150
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:51,023
I'm not gonna offer you
a shoulder to lean on.

1151
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,677
Ok?

1152
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:55,854
Because for once,
I'm gonna be the selfish one.

1153
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:58,987
Go find somebody else because
I'm gonna think about myself.

1154
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:02,991
For once, Reggie,
that's all you had to do.

1155
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:05,385
All you had to do
was think about me.

1156
01:08:09,607 --> 01:08:11,870
You can't do this anymore,
you have to stop,

1157
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:16,396
you have to leave me alone.
- I can't, I can't, Charli.

1158
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,965
Look, I've fallen in love
with you for the second time.

1159

1323
01:22:54,752 --> 01:22:57,320
- No, no, no, I'm not
talking about me and you,

1324
01:22:57,363 --> 01:23:01,237
I'm talking about US.

1325
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,022
I've known your mother
for 30 years.

1326
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:06,894
- Ma, you cheated on dad?
- No.

1327
01:23:06,938 --> 01:23:08,374
- What are you saying?
- No, no, no, no.

1328
01:23:08,418 --> 01:23:11,899
- Whoa, this is not going
as smoothly as I planned.

1329
01:23:11,943 --> 01:23:13,989
Let's just hop right to it.

1330
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:16,339
What I'm saying this morning is,

1331
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:20,430
people marry the wrong people

1332
01:23:20,473 --> 01:23:24,042
all the time.

1333
01:23:24,086 --> 01:23:25,609
- And it's no different
with Charli

1334
01:23:25,652 --> 01:23:28,046
that it was with me
and your father.

1335
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:31,963
Baby, if it's true
and if it's right,

1336
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,010
love will find its way home.
- Yeah.

1337
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,538
- Now, I know the last few days
have been hard on you.

1338
01:23:41,581 --> 01:23:43,061
But I have something
to tell you.

1339
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:46,238
- Oh, no, come on, y'all,
I'm in a real--

1340
01:23:46,282 --> 01:23:48,588
fragile place right now
I don't need to hear

1341
01:23:48,632 --> 01:23:51,243
any more bad news.

1342
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,637
- I've asked your mother
to marry me.

1343
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:58,250
- And I've accepted.
- Congratulations.

1344
01:23:58,294 --> 01:24:01,775
Yeah, yeah, congratulations.

1345
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:11,655
- Yeah, you know, that thing
you do with the feathers.

1346
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:16,094
Yeah.
Listen, uh, sweetie, I gotta go.

1347
01:24:16,138 --> 01:24:18,096
Gotta go. Right.

1348
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,316
[Purrs] Bye.

1349
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:26,974
How are you?

1350
01:24:27,018 --> 01:24:29,107
- I'm still standing.
- Ah.

1351
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:32,023
- Do you have anything for me?

1352
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:37,072
- I have some advice for you.
Come here, have a seat.

1353
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:39,074
Come on.

1354
01:24:45,254 --> 01:24:50,737
I may not look like you
or talk like you,

1355
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:53,218
fortunately I don't have
your attitude,

1356
01:24:53,262 --> 01:24:58,049
but I have been
in your shoes before.

1357
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:02,009
It's all gonna work out.

1358
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:07,624
It's all gonna work out
if you stay out of your own way.

1359
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:11,193
- That's it?
- That's it.

1360
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:14,152
That one's free,
I got something else for you.

1361
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:17,503
- Please don't let it be
a bullshit audition.

1362
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:21,942
I will quit the business before
I do another bullshit audition.

1363
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:24,075
Matter of fact, I was thinking
about writing a screenplay

1364
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,294
about my own life.

1365
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:28,079
- Slow down, Waldo salt,
get out of my chair.

1366
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,734
Out, out, come on,
come on, come on.

1367
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:39,046
For your information,
I have to let you know

1368
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,789
that chatmon has a part in
what about US.

1369
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,574
That he wants to offer to you.

1370
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:46,010
- The lead?
- A part.

1371
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:49,056
He wrote a very small role
into the script.

1372
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,668
It's take it or leave it,
they need to know today,

1373
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:53,191
- what do you say?
- Yes.

1374
01:25:53,235 --> 01:25:55,454
- Yes?
- Yes.

1375
01:25:55,498 --> 01:25:59,023
- You're sure, 'cause remember,
a minute ago,

1376
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:01,634
you were--you were embarking on
that writing career?

1377
01:26:01,678 --> 01:26:04,898
- Yes.
I want the part, yes.

1378
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:42,675
- Hey, now, now.
- All right!

1379
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,851
- Yeah!

1380
01:26:44,895 --> 01:26:48,551
Man, what you got for me?
Make my day.

1381
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:54,252
- We've got your phone bill,
the visa,

1382
01:26:54,296 --> 01:26:56,036
playboy magazine.

1383
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,909
- Men's entertainment.
- As they say.

1384
01:26:58,952 --> 01:27:00,127
- Yes!

1385
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:03,827
- And, hold on, what's this?

1386
01:27:13,663 --> 01:27:15,882
You have a good day now.
- Yeah.

1387
01:27:23,934 --> 01:27:25,283
Man: And cut.

1388
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:32,986
Ok, I think we've got
everything we need.

1389
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:39,993
- Good work, baby.
- Oh, thank you.

1390
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:41,299
- You look good.

1391
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:42,996
- I'm trying to give it
a little character,

1392
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,260
so I can be remembered.

1393
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:13,897
- What's up?
Who are you?

1394
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,986
- I'm darrel.
- Darrel?

1395
01:28:17,204 --> 01:28:18,336
- Yeah.

1396
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,599
- Oh, well, darrel,
don't ever think

1397
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:22,340
that this isn't a great job.

1398
01:28:22,384 --> 01:28:24,211
And no matter what, always show
up on time, you got me?

1399
01:28:24,255 --> 01:28:25,343
Yeah.

1400
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:26,910
- How long you been working
here, man?

1401
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:29,216
- A year. I came here
right after you left.

1402
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:32,089
That's what big Phil told me.
- You know who I am?

1403
01:28:32,132 --> 01:28:35,179
- Of course I know who you are,
everyone around here knows who
you are.

1404
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:36,615
You're cool, man.

1405
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:40,010
I'm darrel,
Derrick's my cousin.

1406
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:53,502
- [Laughs] Hey, cool.
- What's up, Phil?

1407
01:28:53,545 --> 01:28:54,981
How you doing, man?

1408
01:28:55,025 --> 01:28:57,462
- Oh, man, as you can see,
same old station.

1409
01:28:57,506 --> 01:29:00,944
Gas, cars, cars, gas.
- [Laughs]

1410
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:03,773
- We've been through quite
a few mechanics though.

1411
01:29:03,816 --> 01:29:06,036
Hard to keep a quality guy.

1412
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:08,995
But the kid on the pump,
he is good.

1413
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,260
Never breaks the rules,
always on time.

1414
01:29:13,304 --> 01:29:16,829
- You hired Derrick's cousin?
- Derrick's a good kid.

1415
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:20,398
I just couldn't have all that
mess brewing around the station.

1416
01:29:20,442 --> 01:29:22,792
- Oh, yeah, like fraud.
Yeah, I see that.

1417
01:29:22,835 --> 01:29:24,271
- Yeah, fraud.

1418
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:27,362
- You should watch out,
it might run in the family.

1419
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:31,148
- Yeah, well, I would have
helped the kid if he'd only
asked.

1420
01:29:32,976 --> 01:29:35,021
[Bell]

1421
01:29:35,065 --> 01:29:39,852
- Hello, ma'am?
- Ma'am? Wow. You do that.

1422
01:29:39,896 --> 01:29:42,551
I mean, you're trying
to be polite, but no.

1423
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:45,771
Just fill it up, ok? Premium.
- Ok.

1424
01:29:45,815 --> 01:29:49,993
- Here is the final
tuition repayment.

1425
01:29:50,036 --> 01:29:52,430
Just get a big-screen TV
in your new house.

1426
01:29:52,474 --> 01:29:54,606
On me.

1427
01:29:57,043 --> 01:29:58,654
- Wow.

1428
01:29:58,697 --> 01:30:02,701
- Well, you've been taking good
care of my mom too. I mean that.

1429
01:30:06,139 --> 01:30:10,187
- Look, you, uh--do you have
furniture for your place?

1430
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:13,625
- Yeah. Yeah, you know, a little
something something.

1431
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:16,585
I'm just happy to be in
a new place with no mice.

1432
01:30:16,628 --> 01:30:18,238
- Oh!
- For a change, you know?

1433
01:30:18,282 --> 01:30:20,589
It's just that I work so much
it's like I'm rarely ever there.

1434
01:30:20,632 --> 01:30:21,938
- Yeah.
- That's ok, though.

1435
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:25,637
- Yeah, it's, uh-- yeah.
- Yeah.

1436
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:27,944
Which reminds me,
yeah, I got a--

1437
01:30:27,987 --> 01:30:29,989
I got an appointment in an hour.
I gotta get out of here.

1438
01:30:30,033 --> 01:30:31,513
- Oh, that's cool.

1439
01:30:31,556 --> 01:30:34,429
You take care, son.

1440
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:09,376
- Fill her up?

1441
01:31:13,206 --> 01:31:15,513
Yeah.

1442
01:31:15,557 --> 01:31:17,950
- Hey.
- Hey.

1443
01:31:20,953 --> 01:31:22,520
- I saw your film.
- Yeah?

1444
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:24,827
- Yes.

1445
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:27,046
- Yeah, well I mean, I wouldn't
really call it my film,

1446
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:28,787
being as I was only on screen
for, like, 48 seconds.

1447
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:32,095
- Come on,
it was good, it was good.

1448
01:31:32,138 --> 01:31:34,097
- Thank you.

1449
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:54,639
No, no, no, come on.
- [Sighs]

1450
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,599
Ok.

1451
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,080
- We learnt a lot that day.

1452
01:32:03,996 --> 01:32:06,695
Is matrimony as holy
as they say it is?

1453
01:32:08,914 --> 01:32:11,003
- We didn't get married.

1454
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:17,619
I've thought about you.

1455
01:32:17,662 --> 01:32:20,056
I feel like I should be able
to say that I didn't, but--

1456
01:32:20,099 --> 01:32:23,929
- I've thought about you too,
I'm not afraid to admit it.

1457
01:32:28,281 --> 01:32:29,631
What are you--
what are you up to right now?

1458
01:32:29,674 --> 01:32:33,635
- Come on, cool.
- No, it's just, you know,

1459
01:32:33,678 --> 01:32:36,333
I miss you sometimes,
that's all.

1460
01:32:36,376 --> 01:32:37,595
Well--

1461
01:32:37,639 --> 01:32:39,249
you look good up on that screen.

1462
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:41,207
- Yeah? Thank you.

1463
01:32:43,906 --> 01:32:46,909
- Look, um--

1464
01:32:46,952 --> 01:32:49,520
I don't know, you know,

1465
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:54,133
just in case, you know?

1466
01:32:54,177 --> 01:32:56,483
You never know.

1467
01:32:56,527 --> 01:32:59,095
Maybe we'll run into
each other sometime.

1468
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:04,143
And my mother always said
you were the one.

1469
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:11,281
- Bye.

1470
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:57,213
- Is everything ok?

1471
01:34:57,256 --> 01:34:59,563
