1
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,190
You want to know how to build a rocket,
don't ask me.

2
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,310
Don't even ask about it.

3
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,194
You need brain surgery--I'm not your man.

4
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,991
I won't discuss it.

5
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,069
But if you wonder about the quality
of a pair of pants, come to me.

6
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,440
I can't think about it.

7
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,517
Pants! That's what I know. Pants.

8
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,234
I had a day, let me tell you.

9
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,999
He says, What about chinos?

10
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,555
Herbrew slaves in Egypt...

11
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,439
I know chinos.

12
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
...were in Disneyland compared--

13
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,232
He asked me about jeans. Please!

14
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,432
Yes, being whipped is no bargain...

15
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,756
But overalls--now he's insulting me.

16
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,192
...but the slaves didn't have to book
the Himmelmans at Easter.

17
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,995
Einstein knew arithmentic
and I know pants.

18
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,356
North knew he was having a coronary.

19
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,392
I said, Do you know who I am?

20
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,990
As a rule,
11-year-olds don't experience these.

21
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,112
In case you forget let me remind you.

22
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,755
But for North this was a sressful time.

23
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,712
I'm number six!

24
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,556
North was having trouble with his folks.

25
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,470
And it was putting a damper on what
was otherwise a very successful life.

26
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,475
How successful?

27
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,040
Look at the year he's had.

28
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,073
Photosynthesis:
The process by which carbohydrates...

29
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,240
...are formed in the chlorophyll
of plants exposed to sunlight.

30
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,839
But did North's folks realize
how special he was?

31
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,631
Hardly.

32
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,272
Dad.

33
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,439
I was inspecting pants before
you were wearing them...

34
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,949
...Mr. Vice-President-
Because-You're-The-Owner's-Son.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,038
God forbid they go through Atlanta.

36
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,675
Try to match my knowledge of belt loops.

37
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,279
See this rash?

38
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,470
Himmelman.

39
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,431
There's no ointment for this.

40
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,676
You know who you're talking to?

41
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,279
This year's...

42
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,233
...recipient of the coveted
Mr. Inseam award.

43
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,715
Well, that shut him up.

44
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,673
You know what that stupid
Wincheel did to me today?

45
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,110
I saw blood in my stool today.

46
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,150
North?

47
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,429
Are you okay?

48
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,358
What's wrong? - Tell us.

49
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,390
Loosen his pants.

50
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,796
No, I'm okay.

51
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,752
I'll all right.

52
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,710
I'm okay.

53
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,479
But North wasn't okay.

54
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,514
This parent thing began to
affect every part of this life.

55
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,712
It turns into wind.

56
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
What sense does that makes?

57
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,790
It's not--

58
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,639
Maybe it shows us where the wind was.

59
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,360
What are we supposed
to do that information?

60
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,356
To be, or not to--

61
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,469
Line?

62
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,636
Be.

63
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,635
Be.

64
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,310
Ball four.

65
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,476
Six in a row.

66
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,556
Time-out.

67
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,597
How you doing?

68
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,276
I don't get it.

69
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,119
A child is born. He's given a life.

70
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,231
But then he's appreciated by everyone
except the folks who gave him that life.

71
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,954
It's just not right.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,038
Let me rephrase the questio--
how's the arm?

73
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Mr. Blankman,
I have problems I have to work out.

74
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,990
Problems? You?

75
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,514
North?

76
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,837
So while everyone wondered...

77
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,035
...what could be bothering last year's
most valuable player, North left...

78
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,549
...and treaded for this secret spot.

79
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,439
Yes, North had a secret spot.

80
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,352
You know what I mean.

81
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,116
A place that's ordinary to everyone else..

82
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,720
...but for some reason is special to you.

83
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,398
No matter where it is...

84
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,753
...you can feel you're away from
everyone and everything.

85
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,596
The spot where you do your best thinking.

86
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,278
The place where you can reflect
upon what was...

87
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,551
...mull over what is, or just...

88
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,833
...close your eyes and change the world
into whatever you wish it could be.

89
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,231
North probably couldn't remeber when
the spot first revealed its powers to him.

90
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,352
It didn't matter at this point.

91
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,710
What was important was,
whenever he sat in that armchair...

92
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,040
...he looked like any other kid waitting
for his parents to finish shopping.

93
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,196
He was sitting on that spot the
first time I saw him.

94
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,752
Why don't they like me?

95
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,153
What did I do wrong?

96
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,553
You okay, kid?

97
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,591
Yeah.

98
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,551
Good.

99
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,831
'Cause I only got a ten minute break.

100
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,072
My back us killing me.

101
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,757
The last thing I need is to
hear someone's problems.

102
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,397
Hungey?

103
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,839
No, thanks.

104
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,950
Good.

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm starved and this is my last carrot.

106
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,550
So, who are you?

107
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,075
I'm North.

108
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,600
I've seen your name on maps.

109
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,960
Very impressive.

110
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,878
Who are you?

111
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,833
The Easter Bunny. Third floor, toys.

112
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,113
- Until Sunday, that is.
- Then what do you do?

113
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,276
Whatever I want.

114
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,913
I'm independently wealthy.

115
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,233
Fourth of July I might be Uncle same.

116
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,636
At Christmas, maybe Santa Claus.

117
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,712
My life's a holiday.

118
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,355
How about yours? - Not lately.

119
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,517
I had a real bad game today.

120
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
How bad?

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,951
I walked nine Panthers and
hit my coach's wife with a wild pitch.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,116
That's bad.

123
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,273
You got something on your mind?

124
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,395
Well?

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,237
What is it?

126
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,193
You said you didn't want
to hear problems.

127
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,995
You believe everything a
stranger tells you? Spill.

128
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,359
You wouldn't understand.

129
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,314
Try me. - It's my folks.

130
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,396
What about them?

131
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,314
I don't know.

132
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,829
All they care about is themselves.

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,639
Selfish folks.

134
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,194
Yeah, that is rough.

135
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,711
They don't appreciate you.

136
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,599
Exactly. And they're the only ones.

137
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,312
You should hear what
other parents say about me.

138
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,439
North's room is always clean.

139
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,230
North always looks both ways.

140
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,670
North never spoils his appetite.

141
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,476
North flosses.

142
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,913
Holy mackerel,
your folks are sitting on a gold mine.

143
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,474
Tell me about it.

144
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,191
You realize that you're not alone.

145
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,355
What do you mean?

146
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,960
I may be in a bunny suit,
but I'm unaware of some basic truths.

147
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,160
Not being appreciated is a
cormmon childhood lament.

148
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,669
- I'm not common!
- Of course not.

149
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,312
But I bet you that even
Amadeus Mozart...

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,158
...who wrote a symphony at age 3...

151
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,113
...still had to hear an angry parent yell.

152
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,631
Stop banging on that
piano and go to bed.

153
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,830
Yeah, fine.

154
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,236
But Mr. Mozart is dead and I'm alive...

155
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,194
...so I'll bet that I'm in a lot
more pain than he is.

156
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,114
Hard to argue with that.

157
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,595
At this point,
I'd even settle for Mozart's parents.

158
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,800
Unfortunately,
you can't make that choice.

159
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,356
We cannot control who our parent are.

160
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,591
You're stuck with them.

161
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,674
It's not like baseball--
if you dislike your team..

162
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,918
...you become a free agent,
get on another team.

163
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,553
Another team.

164
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,474
This is real life, kid.

165
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,394
The rules are different.

166
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,950
I got to get back upstairs.

167
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,310
If you want my advice--
I know you didn't ask for it...

168
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,956
Go home, make up. And good-bye...

169
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,115
That was it.

170
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,635
Nothing special.

171
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,600
I left him there in his secret spot.

172
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,720
Just him and his thoughts.

173
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,037
Free agency.

174
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,230
What a scoop!

175
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,751
A kid becomes a free agent,
then offers his services..

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,872
...as a son to the highest bidding
set of parents.

177
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,673
Brilliant!

178
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,233
Simply brilliant!

179
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,950
- It's not for sure.
- This could be my Watergate.

180
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,960
Winchell, you print a 2-leaflet
with a circulation of 90.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,231
I may even get the Pulitzer.

182
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,159
I told you because you're my friend,
not editor of the school paper.

183
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,396
- I'm s journalist, North.
- So?

184
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,990
You never said this conversation
was off the record.

185
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,838
I need time to think.

186
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,156
Okay, I'll hold the story.

187
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,795
But any more displays
like the Panther game...

188
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,676
...and some parents may
do some thinking of their own.

189
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,757
That damn Panther game.

190
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,838
And that geography test we took today.

191
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,196
What about it.

192
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,914
You got a 34.

193
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,119
Chicago is in Africa?

194
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,359
=D222- Mexio is an island off Of Montana?
Where'd you get this?

195
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,438
I can't reveal sources, North.

196
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,871
Besides,
how I got this test isn't important.

197
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,593
Why you got this grade is.

198
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,199
Your instincts are correvt.

199
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,472
You need new parent and
you need them now.

200
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,670
Unless...

201
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,710
Unless what?

202
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,877
You haven't the guts to do it.

203
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,630
I've got more guts than
anybody in this town.

204
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,070
Yeah, talk is cheap.

205
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,194
I feel I owe it to my parents to
give one last chance.

206
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,080
What can I say?

207
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,476
You came to me, you sougth my counsel.

208
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,432
The rest is up to you.

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,798
No, that's okay.

210
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,513
Thanks, ankyway.

211
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,630
North wanted to give his folks a
chance to keep the family together.

212
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,311
He called his mom, but she was busy
re-routing the Himmelmans.

213
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
That left Dad.

214
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,519
Pants, can I help you?

215
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,598
My name is North. May I talk to my dad?

216
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,711
What number? - Number six.

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,834
Number six!

218
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,553
Number six!

219
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,394
Phone call for you.

220
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,998
Prom season. Get a number.

221
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,636
It's your son. - Oaky, just a minute.

222
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,556
=E222- is that piping holding up?
- Very well, Mr. Vice President.

223
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,831
Now he's an expert on piping!

224
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,434
Dad, can I talk to you for a minute?

225
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,473
We need these by five.

226
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,477
I only got two legs here!

227
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,792
I'm swamped.
Can we discuss this over dinner?

228
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,671
But, Dad--

229
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,871
Okay, we'll discuss it at dinner.

230
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,231
Yeah, right. Dinner.

231
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,311
Well, that's taht.

232
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,239
Okay, guys, let's roll.

233
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,158
Zoe, you take the south side.

234
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,237
Adam, Koreatown's yours.

235
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,354
Here you go.

236
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,717
- I've made my decision.
- Let me guess.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,913
How's you know? - News reavels fast.

238
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,831
Apparently.

239
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,439
You got a lawyer?

240
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,712
Do I need one? - This is America.

241
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
Everyone has a lawyer.

242
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,998
I happen to know the best.

243
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,360
Arthur Belt.

244
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,278
He's done work for me pro bono.

245
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,390
Move it!

246
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,751
- Where will I find Arthur Belt?
- He'll find you.

247
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,440
Come on! We got a paper to get out!

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,911
Hello, North.

249
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,553
Arthur Belt, at your service.

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,116
The lawyer?

251
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,356
Your lawyer.

252
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,357
From now on, we are a team.

253
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,720
Do and say what I tell you.

254
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,312
Soon, you'll have the best
parents in the world.

255
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,397
You sure you can squeeze me in?

256
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,277
Oh, the ambulance chasing thing?

257
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,154
I just do that to beat the traffic.

258
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,113
You should try it on your bike.
So? Are we a team?

259
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,556
Yeah. I guess so.

260
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,114
You know so.

261
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,749
Yes, North was going to challenge the
entire concept of family as we know it.

262
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,553
The effect was immediate...

263
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,556
...as kids faced pearents with confidence
they opnce just dreamed of.

264
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,351
Great idea! North is a genius.

265
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,631
Jeffrey, don't be ridiculous.

266
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,637
Where did I put Arthur Belt's
phone number?

267
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,239
Did I say ridiculous?

268
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,318
I meant to say,
you look very handsome today.

269
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,235
North will never pull this off.

270
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,431
He's North. He can do anything.

271
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,199
His folks will fight it.

272
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,870
Yes. They won't take this lying down.

273
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Then the media circus began.

274
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
How do you feel about this?

275
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,272
Is Winchell's story accurate?

276
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,230
Can we take that as a yes?

277
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,316
North, can you pull this off?

278
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,113
No comment.

279
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,150
If you succeed,
how will your actions affect Mother's Day?

280
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,030
No comment!

281
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,671
In 1793, the cotton gin was invented.

282
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,270
North, can you tell us the
anme of the inventor?

283
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,393
Under advice from counsel,
I must respectfully say, no comment.

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,672
Finally, North's day in court
arrived, and the world was watching.

285
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,709
All rise for the Honorable Judge Buckle.

286
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,710
All sit for the Honorable Judge Buckle.

287
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,995
Now then, let me remind
you that this is a trial, not a hearing.

288
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,478
Though I'll be hearing things
from both sides, it is not a hearing.

289
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,309
You'll be hearing the same things
I am hearing.

290
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,238
That's your privilege.

291
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,111
However...

292
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,359
...once both eiders are heard,
it will be my job to pass judgment.

293
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,871
You can pass judgment, too,
but that won't count.

294
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,515
That's because I am the judge.

295
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,916
Is this clear to the plaintiff?

296
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,510
Your Honor,
it is quite clear to the plaintiff.

297
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,155
Is this clear to the defense?

298
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,637
Your Honor, the defense rests.

299
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,315
The I will go ahead and
make my judgment.

300
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,716
In my judgment, any folks...

301
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,753
...who would sleep through this trial,
don't deserve...

302
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,713
...awonderful son like North.

303
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,558
I rele in favor of the plaintiff.

304
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,197
Yes!

305
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,039
The system works. You're a free man.

306
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
Hold on, hold on.

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,798
Pipe down!

308
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,394
All rigth!

309
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,233
This is a court of law!

310
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,078
Even though I have made a judgment,
I still mustmake a ruling.

311
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,114
Now then, today is...

312
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,673
July 1st.

313
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,877
Today is July 1st.

314
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,550
I rule that North choose this
nre parents by Labor Day...

315
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,796
...so he can begin school with them.

316
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,234
If he does not choose new parents,
he may return to his original ones. But...

317
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,160
...if he is not in the arms
of either his new parent or...

318
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,511
...original noes by noon on Labor Day...

319
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,473
...he will be remanded to an orphanage.

320
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,639
And if any of you has
ever seen the Little Rascals...

321
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,400
...you know it's no day at the beach.

322
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,837
Orphanage? - Not to worry.

323
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
Kid, from snow on,
the world is your oyster.

324
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,836
Though North didn't
really care for oysters...

325
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,510
...Arthur's enthusiasm was a positive sign.

326
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,040
North free agent draft.

327
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,878
North free agent draft, hello.

328
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,479
His eyes are blue.

329
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,840
Soprano.

330
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,758
Super Maria Ill.

331
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,029
The backstroke.

332
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,958
He believe in God and evolution.

333
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,674
Don't even ask him about
the Warren Commission.

334
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,316
Everyone wants you, kid.

335
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,755
Look at this.

336
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,790
You got a plane ticket tp every
city in the world.

337
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,751
I must advise you...

338
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,194
...to try to learm as much as you can
about each set of parents you audition.

339
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,314
Once you pick someone,
they're you're new folks forever.

340
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,191
Understand?

341
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,516
You bet. - That's the spirit.

342
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,074
Let's get cracking!

343
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,590
So North was on his way.

344
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,756
It was July 4th and this year,
Independence Day had a special meaning.

345
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,920
North was a free man, and on his way
to search out the life he felt he deserved.

346
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,557
There he is. - Look at him.

347
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,875
There he is, Pa.

348
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,470
Hey, howdy, North.

349
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,951
I'm Pa Tex. This is Ma Tex.

350
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,716
Welcome to the great state of Texas.

351
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,433
Howdy.

352
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,319
I know what you're thinking.

353
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,431
Big car, right?

354
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,390
It did cross my mind.

355
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,439
Everything I owe is the biggest
and the best.

356
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,719
That's why we want
you to become our son.

357
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,713
'Cause you're the best.

358
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,833
To the best.

359
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,194
Home sweet home.

360
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,953
This can all be yours, son.

361
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,594
Main house, guest house...

362
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,439
...livestock, oil wells.

363
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,231
- Rumor has It you like baseball.
- I love it.

364
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,397
I used to won the Houston Astros.

365
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,590
What happened?

366
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,599
This morning,
I signed them over to you.

367
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,038
Don't get me wrong.

368
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,799
They're fine team, but...

369
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,150
...aren't we rushing thinhs a little.

370
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,312
Pretty fair shooting, Gabby.

371
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,635
Thank you, boss.

372
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,992
What are you doing here?

373
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,950
I finshed my chores.
I thought I'd do some shooting.

374
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,240
No, I mean...
have you ever been an Easter Bunny?

375
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,556
Easter Bunny? - Careful.

376
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,671
Gabby's killed men for less that that.

377
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,832
Sorry.

378
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,954
No harm done.

379
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,754
What you two cowpokes got
planned for tomorrow?

380
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,952
I reckon we'll wake early and eat.

381
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,196
Then we'll dig for oil and eat.

382
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,912
Then...

383
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,239
...rope some doggies,
bust some bronce, then maybe eat.

384
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,033
You like Tex-Mex?

385
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,796
I'm a fan of any food that
straddles two borders.

386
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,679
That's my boy!

387
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,872
But what is the deal with all this eating?

388
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,473
Remember when I told you everything
I owe is the biggest and the best?

389
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,239
You're already the best.

390
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,556
Now we have to make you the biggest.

391
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,672
Don't fret about not clenning your plate.

392
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,191
Soon your stomach will
stretch and stretch...

393
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,517
...and your capacity to eat will grow and grow.

394
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,397
You say that like it's a good
thing to have happen to your stomach.

395
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,510
It is.

396
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,755
Why?

397
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,200
Then you'll be like Buck.

398
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,958
Our first son.

399
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,435
Biggest boy this state's ever seen.

400
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,111
He could eat more in one day that
anyone else could in a whole month.

401
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,751
That's why Buck hated February.

402
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,714
Where is Buck?

403
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,191
He died in a stampede.

404
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,555
I'm so sorry.

405
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,479
Needless to say,
it was quite a big loss.

406
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,634
But now we want to show
you how much we hope...

407
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,911
...you'll be our new son.

408
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,277
Ready, Pa?

409
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,674
Ready, Ma.

410
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,714
Another rib, son?

411
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,557
You okay, cowboy?

412
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,240
Yeah. Just thinking.

413
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,552
Texas nights are good for thinking.

414
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,871
You doing any particular type of
thinking, or just wandering thinking?

415
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,476
I was thinking I stay here...

416
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,479
...I'd be living in the
shadow of someone else.

417
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,272
What kind of life would that be?

418
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,674
From what I hear about Buck,
what kind of shadow would that be?

419
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,639
Yeah, he was a big one.

420
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,033
Can't be your owe man it they're
comparing you to someone else.

421
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,911
Yeah, right.

422
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,632
I left home because I had parents
who didn't appreciate who I was.

423
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,751
Why choose new parents who'd only
appreciate me if I was someone else?

424
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,351
You're noto something there.

425
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,519
Down in there parts we got a saying.

426
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,397
Sometimes when you're
panninf for gold...

427
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,000
...you have to try more than one stram.

428
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,479
You won't reconider?

429
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,752
I'm sorry,
but it wouldn't be fair to any of us.

430
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,996
Thanks for the opportunity.

431
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,997
Oh, sir.

432
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,278
It's only right I give you back the Astros.

433
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,837
Thanks, son. That's a class gesture.

434
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,630
Well, good-bye.

435
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,236
So long, pard.

436
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,794
We'll miss you.

437
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,394
Hold on, son.

438
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,279
Something to remember
your buddy Gabby by.

439
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,753
Hope it brings you good luck.

440
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,835
Thanks.

441
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,590
So, North resumed his search.

442
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,360
Though he got to the airport by noon,
in respect for Ma and Pa Tex...

443
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,112
...like a true cowboy, he waited 8 hours
so he could fly off into the sunset...

444
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,518
...with no idea of what
was going on back home.

445
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,713
How much loger must
we put with this indignity?

446
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,549
How much loger must we
tolerate these injustices.

447
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,159
The subservience.

448
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,476
It's humiliating, my friends.

449
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,079
It's demeaning.

450
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,874
Now is the time to say no.

451
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,037
Now is the time to say...

452
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,630
...just because you were born
25 or 30 years before me...

453
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,390
...doesn't make you smart,
doesn't make you right.

454
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,671
It just makes you old.

455
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,559
It just makes you smell worse
in the morning.

456
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,794
Now is the time to band together...

457
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,390
...and let our parents
know we're in a new era.

458
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,080
The ear of our liberation!

459
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,353
An era made possible...

460
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,429
...by a kid who had the guts to fing
for the power we now possess.

461
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,112
And now the man whose
brilliant legal mind...

462
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,755
...showed us the path to freedom.

463
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,431
Mr. Arthur Ulyess Belt, Esquire.

464
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,994
Thank you.

465
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,599
I am but a humble servant,
standing at your ready...

466
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,872
...to assist in noble cause.

467
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:48,238
Viva El Norte!

468
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,594
But like I said,
North knew about none of this.

469
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,518
He was going to Hawii...

470
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,758
...to meet what he hoped
would be his new parents.

471
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,753
Governor and Mrs. Ho?

472
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,912
Aloha, North.

473
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,755
Welcome to our island paradise.

474
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,358
Aloha.

475
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,756
We have a big day planned.

476
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,599
Wikki-Wakki will take to the
house so you can change.

477
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,349
Aloha.

478
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,550
Aloha?

479
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,000
I thought that meant hello.

480
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,511
In Hawaii, aloha means hello and good-bye.

481
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,279
Doesn't that get confusing?

482
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,596
Only when you're firing someone.

483
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,280
Oh, well, aloha.

484
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,954
Isn't he great?

485
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,356
If you live here, you'll be younger because
of the difference in time zones.

486
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,917
So you won't die as early as if
lived on the mainland.

487
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,713
That's a plus.

488
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,157
And, it you live in Hawaii,
it's easier to get into a good college.

489
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,270
Why?

490
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,870
In the islands,
we have but 12 letter in our alphabet.

491
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,080
Five vowels.

492
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,077
A-E-I-O-U.

493
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,031
Sevan consonants.

494
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,675
H-K-L-N-P-W.

495
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,439
I didn't know.

496
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,437
Just think about it.

497
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,358
Wakiki, Honolulu.

498
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,596
Kaanapali, Maunalani.

499
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,951
That's intersting,
but how does that get me into college?

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,072
Since we don't use B, C, D, and F..

501
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,557
...you're pretty much
guaranteed to get all A's.

502
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,235
What do you think?

503
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,518
Well, I like what I see.

504
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,394
But I do have one question
just for my own peace of mind.

505
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,395
What is it?

506
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,155
I hope I'm not being insensitive, but...

507
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,399
...you don't have a dead kid you
want me to replace, do you?

508
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,954
Dead kid?

509
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,479
North, Hawaii is a lush and fertile land.

510
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,958
In fact, there's only one
barren area on all of our islands.

511
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,596
Unfortunately, it's Mrs. Ho.

512
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,840
But it all goes right,
you will be our first child.

513
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,800
What a great day.

514
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,789
You know, this might really work out.

515
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,990
I think there's only a few
minor details to discuss.

516
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,637
You know, bedtime,
your views on snacks--that sort of thing.

517
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,514
Well, what are we standing here for?

518
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,314
Let's go in and push
a few numbers around.

519
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,953
See what we come up with.

520
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,636
Ladies and gentlemen,
Governor and Mrs. Ho.

521
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,199
Ladies and gentlemen...

522
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,439
...fellow 50th staters,
I am thrilled to announce...

523
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,555
...we have reached an agreement
which allows me to introduce to you...

524
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,312
...a young man who will become to
Hawaii what the peach is Georgia...

525
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,116
...what the apple is to New York and
what the wind is to Chicago.

526
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,356
Now, without further ado...

527
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,711
...please give a warm
Hawaiian welcome...

528
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,355
...to our new pride and joy...

529
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,359
...our son, North!

530
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,835
What is that?

531
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,312
That will be in every airport,
on every highway--

532
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,350
My crack?

533
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,835
My crack will be show in every airport?

534
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,631
Now, son--

535
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,673
What gives you the right
to show my crack?

536
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,554
See, the truth is, North...

537
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,640
...I'm governor of a
state that's low on self-esteem.

538
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,118
Even now, people don't think
of Hawaii as part of the U.S.

539
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,197
Sure, there's a star for on the flag.

540
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,835
But no one came for
Hands Across America.

541
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,669
Not even a phone call to let
us know nobody was coming.

542
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,872
- It's just inconsiderate.
- He's right.

543
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,515
Mainland peole don't
care about Hawaii.

544
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,871
They come here with the
knobby knees and pale kids...

545
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,358
...and they eat our food and say
aloha--like they really mean it.

546
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,838
A week later, they drop us like
a sack of rancid poi and go home.

547
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,315
How can we fell good about ourselves?

548
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,354
What does this have to do
with my crack?

549
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,240
Don't you see?

550
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,158
If you lived here in Hawaii...

551
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,238
...people would want to settle here.

552
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,120
So they can be close to my crack?

553
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,110
North, you're very important to us.

554
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,753
I don't know.

555
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,391
I need some time to think.

556
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,359
Don't just stand there.

557
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,675
Get your butt in motion.

558
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,757
Yopu might like it.

559
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,190
Squat down. Up, and down.

560
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,594
Now, what is the point?

561
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,836
Gabby, what are you doing here?

562
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,112
For every hour of exercise,
you add an hour to your life.

563
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,393
But who needs that extra time
if you spend it exercising?

564
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,552
You see what I mean, junior?

565
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,950
Who's Gabby?

566
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,151
A ranch hand from Texas.

567
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,073
I don't know the gentleman.

568
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,872
So, how does it feel to be
Hawaii's first son?

569
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,877
I'm not sure that's what I want to be.

570
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,036
Why not?

571
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,113
Beautiful clinate.

572
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,953
Can't beat the fashion.

573
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,680
I know.

574
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,670
But do I want parents who'd show my
most private crevice on a billboard...

575
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,519
...just to feel better about themselves?

576
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,915
Refreshing to meet a kid with such
strong convictions about his crack.

577
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,994
Dig, man.

578
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,077
I always figured...

579
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,320
...it's the parents who make the
kids feel better, not the opposite.

580
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,079
Hang in there.

581
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,271
You'll find what you're looking for.

582
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,674
I hope so.

583
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,436
Though he struck out in
Texas and Hawaii.

584
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,800
North felt...

585
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,356
...no anxiety as he still had
8 weeks until Labor Day.

586
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,560
Welcome to Juneau, Alaska.

587
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,958
Remain seated until the plane comes
to a full stop in Anchorage, Alaska.

588
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,791
To accompany our skid, we will be
showing you another feature film.

589
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,115
Our friend had a dream.

590
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,153
And that dream is becoming a reality.

591
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,717
As North was skidding to Anchorage,
things were heating up at home.

592
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,992
Winchell's speeches had
created a groundwell.

593
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,559
All across the land, kids were holding
their parents at emotional gunpoint.

594
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,793
Anything else, son?

595
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,159
How's my room coming?

596
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,760
I'll have it spotless by dinner.

597
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,871
Viva El North.

598
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,999
As of next Monday...

599
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,794
...no parent will be admitted to an R movie..

600
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,275
...unless accompanied by a kid.

601
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,391
Yeah, right.

602
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,872
Arthur, do I detect a note of melancholy?

603
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,357
North still hasn't found new parents.

604
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,000
Maybe he won't.

605
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,033
Maybe this free agent thing
will blow up in our faces!

606
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,878
I'm surprised at you.

607
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,314
Would I embark on such a great endeavor
without a contingency plan?

608
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,079
Contingency plan?

609
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,873
Oh, good. I love those.

610
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,671
One Coca-Cola.

611
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,911
One Sex On The Beach.

612
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,675
Aren't naughty?

613
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,390
To our future.

614
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,511
And what a future it is.

615
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,038
According to the latest polls,
parents are so nervous...

616
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,996
...78% of them say that they will
vote however their kid tells them to.

617
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,434
And since those kids will do
whatever you tell them to...

618
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,597
Well, I...

619
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,911
What I mean is...

620
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,392
Right-I'm lting here with the next
President of the United States.

621
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,559
I'm happy for you.

622
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,320
You'll make a find commader in chief.

623
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,874
Doll, can your on my lower back?

624
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,071
That's where my tension builds up.

625
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,239
Flight 24 from Hawaii, by way...

626
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,398
...of Juneau is now arrving at gate 7.

627
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,039
Great landing.

628
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,799
You got that skid down to a science.

629
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,479
Thanks for the kind words.

630
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:05,436
We dent a terminal now and then,
but after a while you get it down.

631
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,994
Thanks.

632
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,753
North's first impression
of Alaska was positive.

633
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,111
The air was clean, it was beautiful.

634
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,631
Best of all, it was far away feom
everything, so there was nothing...

635
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,755
...to distract from life's
most precious commodity.

636
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,951
The love of a good family.

637
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,193
Here you go, North.

638
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,594
A nice cup of hot cocoa,
and to go with that, our state dish.

639
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,960
...Eskimo pie.

640
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,275
Thank you.

641
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,560
Look at that. The salmon are running.

642
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,394
I'll get a couple of poles
and go fishing.

643
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,875
Great. I love fishing.

644
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,476
This is the life, huh? - Sure is.

645
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,557
You like Christmas? - Who doesn't?

646
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,593
Wait till you've had
an Alaskan Christmas.

647
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,998
Since our days last for months,
you can imagine the festivities.

648
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,876
Opening presents takes three
weeks alone, right, Ma?

649
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,994
This all sounds great,
but what's the catch?

650
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,040
What do you mean?

651
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,753
What's in it for you?

652
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,434
Nothing.

653
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,590
Really?

654
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,600
No dead kids, no low self-esteem?

655
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,030
No frozen skeletons in your closet?

656
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,278
We have pride, North.

657
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,118
We're proud of our pride.

658
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,038
We wouldn't ask anything of a child.

659
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,040
All we want is for you to
be the best North you can be.

660
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,515
We know you'll be a source of pride to the...

661
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,793
...Eskimo community for many,
many years.

662
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,552
Jeepers Creepers--that reminds me.

663
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,799
Dad, let's go. Time to flow.

664
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,069
Coming.

665
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,270
Time to what?

666
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,119
Bundle up. It's a long walk.

667
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,035
Who's that?

668
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,717
This is your new grandfather.

669
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,360
Hello, North.

670
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,318
What does time to flow mean?

671
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,240
When an Eskimo gets too old or
weak to contribute to society...

672
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,069
...the whole family walks
together to the ocean.

673
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,871
Right.

674
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,231
Then the Eskimo is proudly
placed on an ice floe...

675
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,352
...and sent out to sea to die with dignity.

676
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,629
And pride.

677
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,433
Okay, everybody, let's go.

678
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:32,517
But just because he's old doesn't
mean he can't be part of the family.

679
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,960
Well, it's a tradition.

680
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,789
I promise, Drandpa wants this as
much as anyone.

681
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,910
Right, Grandpa?

682
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,679
Yeah, right.

683
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,360
I've been looking forward to this.

684
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,838
As they made the long trek to the sea..

685
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,351
...North decided to get to know
his new grandpa.

686
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,632
He had trmendous affection
for old folks.

687
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,673
He found them to be warm,
understanding...

688
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,236
...and, most importantly,
wahy too tired to yell.

689
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,477
Knowing his time was limited...

690
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,231
North tried to learn all this wise
old man knew about life in the tundra.

691
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,236
And another thing--up here...

692
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,071
...if your mom says don't make a face
because it will freeze that way...

693
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,079
...you better take her seriously.

694
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,398
Can't you stay a little while longer?

695
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,193
There's so much you can teach me.

696
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,516
Next!

697
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,631
Good-bye.

698
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,551
Let's go.

699
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,034
I only got 4 months of sunlight here.

700
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,560
Move it.

701
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,350
Come on!

702
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,959
You should have done this before.

703
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,195
I got a civilization to run here.

704
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,630
Move it along.

705
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,350
Next!

706
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,993
Let's go. You know what's going on.

707
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,271
Come on. Come on, please.

708
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,956
Good-bye, North.

709
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,432
Do you really have to go?

710
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,159
Don't worry about him, North.

711
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,350
He had a great life.

712
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,280
He's happy to go before he
start embarrassing himself.

713
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,597
When drool hardens,
it's not a pretty sight.

714
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,312
But--

715
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,353
But, but, but. Let's go.
This is no surprise to you.

716
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,837
Take a walk. Come on, let's go.

717
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,195
Bye, Dad.

718
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,157
Bye, Dad.

719
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,916
Bye.

720
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,117
If there's a change in policy
in the next few weeks...

721
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,039
...feel free to track me down.

722
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,190
What did he say?

723
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,675
Why don't we grab a ride home?

724
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,313
Great idea.

725
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,436
Don't worry about Granpa.

726
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,709
He'll be okay.

727
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,600
Can I ride on top?

728
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,597
Sure. It's the best view.

729
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,390
Landscape sure is beautiful up here.

730
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,120
Hey, it's you.

731
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,273
No, it's not.

732
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,713
Smell that fresh air.

733
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,193
No smog up here.

734
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,752
How could they do that?

735
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,994
Not even own parents would send
my granpa away like that.

736
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,150
Hey, son.

737
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,032
How's the view up there?

738
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,831
Great. Thanks.

739
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,872
Son...

740
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,114
Unless I'm mistaken,
you're that fellow North.

741
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,354
Unless I'm further mistaken,
you have until Labor Day...

742
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,995
...a week from now, to find new parents.

743
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,239
And unnless I'm mistaken even further,
you haven't found them.

744
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,313
Labor Day isn't next week.
I just got here.

745
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,397
You walked from your house to the sea?

746
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,673
That's a seven-week walk.

747
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,078
No wonder we stopped for lunch
49 times.

748
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,110
Don't feel bad.

749
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,153
That 6 months of daylight
throws everyone off.

750
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,398
I only showered 12 times during the 70s.

751
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,359
Oh, man.

752
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,756
I'll never find new parents.

753
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,589
You can always go back to
your original parents.

754
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,630
Oh, yeah.

755
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,319
That's what I want.

756
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,832
To go back to people who haven't
tried to contact me in 8 weeks.

757
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,635
Take me to the airport.
I haven't got much time.

758
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,796
You got it.

759
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,275
North, desperate with time running out,
raced toward an uncertain future.

760
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,109
He was upset his parent hadn't
called in 2 months.

761
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,631
He couldn't know they hadn't
done anything in 2 months.

762
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,593
As curator of the
Smithsonian Institution...

763
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,350
...it is honor to unveil the
newest addition to our...

764
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,154
...illustrious Hall of Achievement.

765
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,954
At 78 consecutive days and counting...

766
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,880
...the longest simultaneous
coma in medical history...

767
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,197
...ladies and gentlemen..North's folks.

768
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,158
I will now take questions.

769
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,514
How can you equate a medical oddity
with man's landing on the moon?

770
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,951
With all respect to the achievements
of the Apollo 11 crew...

771
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,471
...the sociological impact of
what these folks did...

772
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,878
...dwarfs those of Mr. Armstrong, et al.

773
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,240
All they did was faint.

774
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,797
And thereby shifted the familial
balance of power...

775
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,559
...throughout the world.

776
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,592
Through the world?

777
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,912
This is bigger than we thought.

778
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,278
Bigger than you thought.

779
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,630
That's why you're only going to be president.

780
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,271
But what if they wake uo in the next week?

781
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,994
What if they beg for him to come back?

782
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,556
Oh, my God--
what of North goes bnack yo his folks?

783
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,594
Arthur, don't you know that
that's an impossibility?

784
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,553
That I would use all my power...

785
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,593
...to preven't a thing like that
from happening.

786
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,636
Why don't we grab some Chinese?

787
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,149
Maybe the MSG will calm you down.

788
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,634
Despite North concerm
about his deadline...

789
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:31,675
...he was consled by knowing God
needed but 6 days to create the universe.

790
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:37,000
Certainly, with the extra time,
he could find two measly parents.

791
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,159
Greetings, North.

792
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,633
I am thy new father.

793
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,034
And this good woman,
who art my wife...

794
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,833
...art thy new mother.

795
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,076
These art thy new bothers...

796
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,680
...who art namled Ezekial.

797
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,677
And these art thy new brothers...

798
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,360
...who art names Art.

799
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,875
Hey, this lloks great.

800
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,756
I've always dreamt of life without
the ever-present nuisance of electricity.

801
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,634
Let me just get something.

802
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,356
I left butter churn in the
overhead compartment.

803
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,035
Floor it!

804
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,237
North was not one for
snap judgments...

805
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,480
...but he had 7 days to evaluate a
world full of potential parents.

806
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,517
Long live the North dynasty!

807
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,032
Give him the emperor cut.

808
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,631
You seem like nice folks...

809
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,037
...but to be honest with you, if I lived here...

810
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,751
...I wouldn't get much homework done.

811
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,360
With three days to go before
his Labor Day deadline...

812
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,110
...North, the world traveler,
arrived in New York...

813
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,076
...to interview his final set of parents,
Ward and Donna Nelson, who...

814
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,555
...with their children, Bud and Laura...

815
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,638
...live in the quaint upstate town of Bedford.

816
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,036
When contacted at his office...

817
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,155
...Ward, the local pediatrician,
who still makes house calls, said.

818
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,717
My family and I would like
to see North's long journey...

819
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,877
...finally be rewardded...

820
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,196
...with a warm and loving home.

821
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,039
We hope we can provide it for him.

822
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,915
Thanks.

823
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,429
Hi, North!

824
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,234
Ward, Bud, Laura he's here.

825
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,714
He's here.

826
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,400
Hi, North.

827
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,439
Welcome to our home, son.

828
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,436
Come in. You tired?

829
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,391
Hungry?

830
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,999
Mom and I baked cookies.

831
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,633
You like Nintendo?

832
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,115
At Mount Rushmore, angry parents...

833
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,279
...protested a bill to lower the voting age...

834
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,470
...to seven.

835
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,117
According to Arther Belt,
the rising politician who drafted the--

836
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,832
Wait!

837
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,599
They were talking about me.

838
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,869
Relax.

839
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,233
Soon you'll be hearing your name
so much, even you'll be sick of it.

840
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,280
I hight doubt it.

841
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,671
Talk to me.

842
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,474
It's Al with the sleeping dogs.

843
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,000
What about them?

844
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,874
Looks like they counted their last sheep.

845
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,234
So it does.

846
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,193
How long to put Operation Xerox into place?

847
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,799
Less than a minute.

848
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,512
Go to it. And Al...

849
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,390
Yeah, boss?

850
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,990
Don't be burprised if you see extra
zeros in your paycheck.

851
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,520
Thanks, boss.

852
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,916
And, Al. - Yeah, boss?

853
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,236
Don't be surprised if there aren't.

854
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,555
I understand.

855
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,233
Good morning.

856
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,040
Where are we?

857
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,799
Where is our son?

858
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,559
Can we see our son?

859
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,590
Absolutely. Follow me.

860
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,200
We have a limo waiting with
coffee and hot Danish.

861
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,879
That sounds good.

862
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,594
I won't lie to you,
I have a bit of an appetite.

863
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,960
Honay?

864
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,151
I could eat. - Right this way.

865
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,558
Hike!

866
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,559
Okay, Laura, sack the quarterback.

867
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,954
Touchdown!

868
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,114
You faked me right out of my sock, North.

869
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,514
Come and get it.

870
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,109
It's great you're here, North.

871
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,038
I always wanted a brother.

872
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,073
Now I have two big
brothers to look out for me.

873
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,352
I know we're excited to have North here...

874
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,915
...but he hasn't decided to stay
with us yet.

875
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,112
- You got to stay, North.
- We really want you.

876
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,629
Help yourself, everybody.

877
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,396
Can we go to theb carmival tomorrow?

878
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,032
Yeah, can we?

879
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,037
I dont' see why not. Ward?

880
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,031
Sounds good to me.

881
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,513
North...

882
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,872
...we miss you so much.

883
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,793
Please forgive us.

884
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,716
We made... so many mistakes.

885
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,679
We should have appreciated
you more.

886
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,033
If only you could give us just
one more chance.

887
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,672
We love you, son.

888
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,953
We love you very much.

889
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:24,991
Cut!

890
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,555
Very nice. Very, very nice.

891
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,431
Touching. Moving.

892
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,315
And yet not over the top.

893
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,430
Keep taping.

894
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,756
So, crazy summer, huh?

895
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,474
Terrible. - Very disturbing.

896
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,318
I know what you're going through.

897
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,592
But if North doesn't come back,
you could always adopt.

898
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,919
I just met this adorable
7-year-old-boy.

899
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,236
His name... was Hugh.

900
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,839
Maybe you can adopt him.

901
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,270
Maybe Hugh can be your son.

902
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,793
We don't want Hugh.

903
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,793
He's not our son.

904
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,713
We want North.

905
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,870
I undertand.

906
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,515
Insensitive of me to even bring it up.

907
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,756
You want some more coffee?

908
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,793
Nah, that's okay. - Not for me.

909
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,272
I still don't see why we
can't talk to North in person.

910
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,994
That would be a big mistake.

911
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,838
He's very angry right now.

912
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,109
Very sensitive.

913
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,949
Show up unannounced and
it could blow up in your face.

914
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,834
It would just kill me
to see that happen.

915
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,032
I suhhest you lay low for a while.

916
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,276
I'll have someone escort
you to the Plaza.

917
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,519
I told Jean Pierre to give you all
the room service you want.

918
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,639
As North's best friend...

919
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,833
...I'd happy to show him this tape,
to pave the way for you.

920
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,155
Thank you, Winchell.

921
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,238
You're real friend.

922
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,509
I try.

923
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,438
Bring the car around for North's folks.

924
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,199
Consider it done, sir.

925
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,439
You know,
you're doing very well for a 6th grader.

926
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,472
I caught a few breaks.

927
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,631
Adam, take tape to editing.

928
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,429
Colonel Mustard...

929
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,279
...in the study with the rope.

930
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,195
- I don't have any of hose.
- Me, either.

931
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,560
Me, either.

932
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,034
Let's see.

933
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,913
Colonel Mustard,
in the study, and here's the rope.

934
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,997
Good job. - Can we play again?

935
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,520
No, it's time to hit the sack.

936
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,517
Tomorrow's the carnival.

937
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,199
Your mom's right.

938
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,631
Everybody upstairs to bed right now.

939
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,957
Good night, Mom.

940
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,989
Good night, North.

941
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,230
Brush your teeth
before you go to bed.

942
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,237
Sorry to bother you,
but I got a delivery for a kid nsmed North.

943
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,191
What is it?

944
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,677
It's an urgent message from
his original parents.

945
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,433
I'll see he gets it.

946
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,590
North? Honey?

947
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,876
Can you come down here?

948
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,956
Coming.

949
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,031
What is it?

950
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,515
A man left this for you.

951
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,711
It's a message from your parents.

952
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,353
From my parents?

953
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,477
Do you mind it I...?

954
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,556
Of course not.

955
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,400
Would you like to be alone?

956
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,033
No, that's okay.

957
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,793
What would you most like
to say to your son?

958
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,440
We don't want Hugh.

959
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,756
How can that be? He's your son.

960
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,792
He's not our son.

961
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,750
Aren't you upset that you may
see your son again?

962
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,632
Nah, that's okay.

963
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,920
Isn't this gut-wrenching,
tortuous emotional experience?

964
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,076
Not for me.

965
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,595
He's not our son.

966
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,552
We don't want Hugh.

967
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,278
North, honey, are you okay?

968
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,353
Is there anything we can do for you?

969
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,674
Yeah.

970
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,392
Let me be your son.

971
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,592
Finally, North had new parents.

972
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,919
Parents who made him feel wanted,
secure and loved.

973
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,191
Yet something wa still wrong.

974
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,514
The Nelsons were everything he wanted.

975
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,631
Why couldn't he embrace them?

976
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,952
North needed answers.

977
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,749
We don't understand why you're leaving.

978
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,119
Neither do I.

979
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,198
You're all nice people
and I'm really going to miss you.

980
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,151
I just have to be alone.

981
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,793
We'll miss you too.

982
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,433
Ans so will Oliver.

983
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,035
North.

984
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,794
If you're hungry on your
way to New York.

985
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,715
Thanks, Mom.

986
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,958
I mean Mrs. Nelson.

987
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,632
So with 24 hours until
his Labor Day deadline...

988
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,072
...no parents, and the prospect
of living in an orphanade looming.

989
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,950
...North felf he only
had one option left.

990
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,554
He would disappear.

991
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,837
Can you spare some extra chage?

992
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,276
Maybe it'll bring you more
luck than it did me.

993
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,311
Hey, it's got a hole in it!

994
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,829
What good does this do me?

995
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,480
Yes, he would disappear.

996
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,669
Ans where better to do that than amidst
the teeming, faceless masses of the city?

997
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,956
He's entering the park.

998
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,516
I'm just looking for the
right time and place.

999
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,914
So long, Al.

1000
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,680
What was that about?

1001
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,792
Our friend has a change of heart.

1002
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,870
Change? - He left the Nelsons.

1003
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,550
He's decided to come to our fair city.

1004
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,755
Oh, no. But this ruins everything.

1005
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:04,080
Arthur, please. Use your head.

1006
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,192
This is godsend.

1007
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,151
It is?

1008
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,680
Of course.

1009
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,394
Even as we speak,
adults across this great land of ours...

1010
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,995
...are feeling humiliated.
They blame North for their frustrations.

1011
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,270
Do you know how many angry parents...

1012
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,391
...would like nothing better
trhan to do away with him?

1013
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,913
And do you know the one catalyst...

1014
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:33,831
...that can give a political
movement true cohesion?

1015
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,270
That's right. A martyr.

1016
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,880
You're a genius.

1017
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,030
It's briliant.

1018
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,990
It's absolutely Winchellian.

1019
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:58,751
But for North to be a martyr,
doesn't he have to be killed by a parent?

1020
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,480
Well, maybe we'll gxet lucky.

1021
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:06,800
As North ran for his life...

1022
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,631
...he realized his dream finding perfect
parents had become a nightmare.

1023
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,356
Damn it!

1024
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,797
North. Over here.

1025
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,911
Adam, what are you doing here?

1026
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,720
Listen to me carefully.

1027
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,910
I'm not here.

1028
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,791
You never saw me.

1029
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,116
We're not having a conversation.

1030
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,991
Got that?

1031
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,271
Got what? - Perfect?

1032
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,831
So, what are we not talking about?

1033
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,396
This.

1034
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,950
I don't see anything.

1035
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,916
What you don't see is a tape of a
talk Winchell had with your parents.

1036
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,270
I saw it. - No, you didn't.

1037
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,720
I forgot. I didn't see it.

1038
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,119
No, you saw it.

1039
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,152
This is what you didn't see when you saw it.

1040
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,914
I see.

1041
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,992
You don't. Look at the tape.

1042
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,920
How'd you find me?

1043
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,632
Winchell.

1044
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,080
He bugged the Nelsons' phone.

1045
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,116
I've been working for him
since you left home.

1046
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,189
Some guy was chasing me with a gun.

1047
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,833
He was shooting at me.

1048
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,475
Did that have anything
to do with Winchell?

1049
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,270
Oh, man.

1050
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,720
So why are you doing this?

1051
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,910
I'm not.

1052
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,590
But it I was, it's because I think
Winchell's gone too far.

1053
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,792
And you were always
good to me, North.

1054
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,160
You never picked me last.

1055
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,078
You never made me play right field.

1056
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,873
I won't forget that.

1057
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,873
Thanks, Adam.

1058
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,400
Oh, man.

1059
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,160
I just don't feel safe anywhere.

1060
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,397
Adam?

1061
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,919
A hot dog with just mustard.

1062
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,155
One dollar.

1063
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,395
Out of five.

1064
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,394
Two, three, four, five.

1065
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,874
There you go.

1066
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,560
Where'd you get this?

1067
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,115
A bum bought a hot dog
from me an hour ago.

1068
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,435
Why?

1069
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,195
No reason.

1070
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,634
You won't see him no more.

1071
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,039
Wach! Wach!

1072
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,240
Move it, kid.

1073
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:49,753
A man walks into a bar.

1074
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,120
He sits down next to a...

1075
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,232
...beautuiful woman and
soon the conversation...

1076
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,158
...turns to sex.

1077
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:01,150
He says, My darling, do you
smoke after you make love?

1078
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,518
She says, I don't know.

1079
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,676
I never looked.

1080
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,032
But I'll tell you one thing--
my smoke alarm never went off.

1081
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,240
Good night, folks. You've been great.

1082
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,470
You the kid with the tape? Come in.

1083
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,831
I want to try out my new VCR.

1084
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,878
- How did you know me?
- What?

1085
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,152
I came to see you because you
looked familiar.

1086
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,159
Of course I do.
I'm almost famous. Joey Fingers.

1087
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,998
And you are? - North.

1088
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,997
One of my favorite directions.

1089
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,030
Mallomar?

1090
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,480
No, thanks.

1091
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,113
That bad, huh.

1092
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,154
No kid refuese a Mallomar
unless he has heavy problems.

1093
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,674
North...

1094
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,072
...we miss you so much.

1095
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,914
Please forgive us.

1096
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,834
We made...

1097
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,673
...so many mistakes.

1098
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,959
We should have appreciated you more.

1099
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,074
If only you could give
us just one more chance.

1100
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,632
We love you, son.

1101
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,832
We love you very much.

1102
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,077
Beautiful.

1103
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,600
Works great.

1104
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,109
You got some pretty nice folks, kid.

1105
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,032
I said, got nice folks.

1106
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,830
I guess so.

1107
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:45,190
What do you mean, you guess?
And what do they mean, one more chance?

1108
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,799
I thought they didn't love me.

1109
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,354
What, are you nuts?

1110
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:52,389
They didn't always pay that
much attention to me.

1111
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,070
So I left to find new folks
who's appreciate me more.

1112
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:59,796
I searched the world,
but nobody was good enough.

1113
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,077
Not even the Nelsons,
who I just left.

1114
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,589
And they weren't bed folks.

1115
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,790
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

1116
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,193
Nothing wrong with you.

1117
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,990
And I'm sure the Nelsons weren't bad.

1118
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,993
They just weren't your folks.

1119
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,473
You see those opeple tonight?

1120
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,790
The audience?

1121
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,833
They paid attention to me.
Heard every word I said.

1122
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,519
They laughted. They screamed.

1123
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,676
They applauded.

1124
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,880
They loved me.

1125
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,914
But do you think that audience will
mmake me tea if I'm sicck?

1126
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,152
Or give me advice when
I've fought with my best friend?

1127
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,591
Or, God forbid, I get in trouble.

1128
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,838
Who will I turn to? I'll give you a hint.

1129
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,119
Not that audience.

1130
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,039
- Oh, God. What have I done?
- I'll tell you.

1131
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,596
You've realized something most
people take a lifetime to get.

1132
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,916
Some people never figure it out at all.

1133
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,713
A bird in the hand is greener than the
grass under the other guy's bushes.

1134
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:06,789
It's a metaphor used mostly by
gardeners and landscape people.

1135
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,835
Hey, kid!

1136
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,710
Where are you going?

1137
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,479
Home. I miss my parents.

1138
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,830
How? You got a car?

1139
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,879
No. I'm eleven.

1140
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,513
Then we better take mine.

1141
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,315
Thanks a lot, Mr. Fingers.

1142
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,350
Make it Joey.

1143
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,993
And you're welcome.

1144
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,791
Remember-- if you can't stand the heat,
stay out of Miami.

1145
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,399
What does that metaphor mean?

1146
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,669
What metaphor?

1147
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:52,351
In August,
your balls stick to your leg like glue.

1148
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:56,880
So, North finally found the
parents he'd been looking for.

1149
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,479
Much to this surprise...
they were his own.

1150
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,355
So, with a smile on this face...

1151
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,429
...North waited to board the plane
that would take him to those parents.

1152
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,920
Where are you going?

1153
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,555
- Home.
- Not on this plane, you're not.

1154
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,314
Why not?

1155
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,633
It says here you're dead.

1156
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,275
But I'm not.

1157
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,834
How can I be sure?

1158
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,278
I'm standing here.

1159
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,549
Which scares me.

1160
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,310
If I'm scared, imagine how
the other passengers will react.

1161
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,680
But I'm not dead.

1162
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,155
Sorry, I can't take the chance.

1163
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,232
It's North. He's alive.

1164
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,151
What's he doing here?

1165
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,998
The flight's to his hometown.

1166
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,157
He's going to his parents.

1167
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,840
It will ruin everything. Get him!

1168
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,920
What did I do?

1169
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,274
Hey, hid, hop in!

1170
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,956
Are you some kind of
guardian angel?

1171
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,878
I guess you could say that.

1172
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,880
We at Federal Express
feel we are guardians.

1173
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,470
Guardians of your most
important packages and communiques.

1174
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,920
Yeah, yeah.

1175
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,599
Just get me home, will you?

1176
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,840
If your absolutely, positively must
be there tomorrow we can do it.

1177
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,876
You don't let up for a second do you?

1178
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,074
I have no idea what you mean.

1179
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,231
Just tell me what to do, okay?

1180
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,475
Get in.

1181
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,560
Federal Express, huh?

1182
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,875
Okay, thanks.

1183
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,559
Oh, Al.

1184
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,751
Can I have a word with you?

1185
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,756
Sure, boss.

1186
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,555
Remember when you told
me North was dead?

1187
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,159
Just curious...

1188
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,634
What did you base that on?

1189
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,033
I can only assume you think this is blood.

1190
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:21,279
And if had an I.Q. below 24,
I suppose I might think the same.

1191
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,438
But the stain on this cap is from borscth.

1192
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:25,831
Borscht.

1193
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,477
A beet-based soup,
Russian in origin, frequently served...

1194
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,354
...chilled with a dollop of sour cream.

1195
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:35,198
I make a good borscht.

1196
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,199
And I'd love to sample it someday.

1197
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,118
But the point I'm making, Al...

1198
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:46,270
...is that unless North's head is filled
with this traditional Slavic delicacy...

1199
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,789
...he's hot dead, you idiot!

1200
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,399
Not now, Arthur!

1201
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,195
This just calls for a slight change in plans.

1202
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,834
I'll take over.

1203
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,389
Okay.

1204
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,033
Sign on the fourth line.

1205
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,430
What time is it?

1206
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,154
Normally I would answer,
No later than 10:30.

1207
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:19,037
But thanks to the jam on the highway,
I'm sorry to say it's almost ten of twelve.

1208
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,519
We'll be happy to refund--

1209
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,074
No, that's okay!

1210
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,156
Mom!

1211
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,675
Dad!

1212
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,035
I'm home!

1213
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,193
Mom!

1214
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,312
Where are you guys?

1215
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,874
Hello, North. Happy Labor Day.

1216
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,077
I trust enjoyed your summer.

1217
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,349
Where are my folks?

1218
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,471
At a safe place.

1219
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,360
Where the hell are my parents?

1220
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,513
Did you say the hell?

1221
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,677
My this summer has really broadened you.

1222
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:03,760
I have ten minutes to find my parents.

1223
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,359
If you don't tell me where they are...

1224
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,633
...I'll show you how much
I've broadened, asshole!

1225
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,719
Why are you smiling?

1226
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,470
I was thinking what s heat-warming
scene it will be...

1227
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,070
...when you meet your parents
at your secret spot.

1228
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,396
How do you know
about my secret spot?

1229
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,999
I'm a jornalist.

1230
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,997
It's job to know about these things.

1231
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,319
As much as I'm enjoying this chat,
shouldn't you be off?

1232
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,431
After all, you're down to...

1233
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,393
...9 minutes.

1234
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:50,391
Where is he?

1235
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,000
Winchell said he'd be here by now.

1236
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,280
Don't worry.

1237
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,879
He'll be here soon.

1238
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,798
Soon may not be good enough.

1239
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,230
I've been sent here by the court...

1240
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,671
...to ensure North is in
your arms by 12:00 noon.

1241
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,518
How much time is left?

1242
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,994
Six minutes.

1243
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,839
And that's my own clock
from my own house.

1244
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,520
Maybe we should look for him.

1245
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,471
No, honey.

1246
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,196
What if we leave and then North
shows up and we miss him?

1247
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,916
Relax, honey.

1248
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,633
Winchell's a man of his word.

1249
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,432
He has less than one minte.

1250
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,194
I'll go look for him.

1251
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,038
Good idea. - Bad idea.

1252
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,960
The ruling states that North
be in the arms of both parents.

1253
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,878
That's two parents, four arms.

1254
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:17,435
If one of you leaves,
that's only two arms.

1255
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,631
That's math.

1256
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,471
Mom!

1257
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,351
Dad!

1258
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,833
You still here?

1259
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,078
Yeah.

1260
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,952
I must have fallen asleep.

1261
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,670
Come on.

1262
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,915
I'll give you a ride home.

1263
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,880
...then you were a beach bum,
then your drove a sleigh...

1264
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,516
...and you said my parents were
the best parents for me.

1265
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,275
I said that?

1266
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,072
I must be a pretty smart guy.

1267
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,596
What's that?

1268
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,915
Oh, nothing.

1269
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,031
Just something I've always had.

1270
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,672
You know, for good luck.

1271
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,032
It may be good luck for you.

1272
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,669
I bet that eagle is
whistling another tune.

1273
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,632
Here we go-- 35 Maple Drive.

1274
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,680
Thank a lot, mister.

1275
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,393
Don't mention it.

1276
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:22,720
And remember--be it ever so humble,
there's no place like home.

1277
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,593
With the possible exception of
Vegas when Sinatra's in town.

1278
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,072
Mom! Dad!

1279
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,389
Where were you? We were worried sick.

1280
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,237
I fell asleep in the mall.

1281
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,434
We called the hospitals, the police.

1282
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,233
We lokked everywhere.

1283
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,675
You did?

1284
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,195
Of course we did.

1285
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,870
We love you so much, North.

1286
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,678
If anything happened to you,
I don't know what we'd do.

1287
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,111
I love you guys, too.

1288
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,758
You hungry? - A little bit.

1289
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,519
A little bit?

1290
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,960
Okay, a lot.

1291
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,993
You go upstairs and
put on your pajamas.

1292
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,111
We'll bring something up.

1293
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,829
Honey by the way Winchell called

1294
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,475
and he said he hoped you're not still
omgry at him for bringing that

1295
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,831
pictwies of you and your muder
wear on the school newspaper.

1296
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,553
Nah! That's okay.

1297
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,838
Oh! North! We're so happy you home.

1298
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,630
Mom!

1299
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,319
I'm sorry.

1300
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,920
I just want reaching for each others,
and I got shot in the back

1301
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,872
and that when I woke up.

1302
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,711
Well, that's quiet a dream.

1303
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:01,794
You know Norht, honey.

1304
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,512
Daddy and I are only human
and sometimes,

1305
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:10,079
we get a little preoccnipied and
that never mean that we don't love you.

1306
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,630
I know.

1307
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,240
Still no excuse for us that
not to listen better.

1308
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,391
I know.

1309
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:23,153
I tell you what from now on we both
gonna try a little harder, is't it okay son?

1310
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,634
Thanks, Dad.

1311
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,079
Good night, lovely.

1312
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,315
Good night, Mom.

1313
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,030
Good night kido.

1314
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,514
Good night, Dad.

1315
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,198
Oh! Dad, tomorrow do you think
we're going to...

1316
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,711
Another pants with the rippost they put it
purpose, to me those are up real jeans.

1317
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,514
You see this rash, it fells that human
are only take the ball perle.

1318
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,314
I think my pants will hold, only if you
put in the box for savation army.

1319
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,319
The active style will even push
making out.
