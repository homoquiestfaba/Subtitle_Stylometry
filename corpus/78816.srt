1
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:39,752
Happy Halloween.

2
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,989
Oh, boy! Trick or treat!

3
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:47,289
Tonight, l'm going to go out
and scare everybody.

4
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:49,488
You? Scare everybody?

5
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:53,158
Donald, on a Scare-o-Meter,
you're barely a squeal.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,497
Yep. She's right.

7
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:55,796
You're not going
to frighten anyone...

8
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:57,736
dressed up
like a big red bunny.

9
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:02,902
Bunny? l'll show you.

10
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:10,376
Huh. There seems to be...

11
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,385
an awful lot of villains
here tonight.

12
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,683
Aw, relax, Minnie.
lt's Halloween.

13
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,848
l'm sure they're not
up to any tricks.

14
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,916
Oh, Halloween
at the House of Mouse.

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,326
All treats and no tricks.

16
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:25,195
lf this were my house,
l'd run things differently.

17
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,462
-Add a splash of evil?
-Pillage and plunder?

18
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,627
Blah, blah, blah.

19
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:31,660
Every year it's the same thing--
all talk and no play.

20
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,173
What a bunch of dull villains.

21
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,573
Well, this year
will be different.

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,339
l've got a trick
for Mickey Mouse...

23
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:40,812
but you'll all have to wait
until midnight.

24
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,450
lt's a Houseketeer Halloween...

25
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:49,683
so grab your garlic and get set
for America's Most Haunted.

26
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:54,820
He's Count Mickey Mouse.

27
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:57,329
Velcome.
Velcome, my children.

28
00:01:57,364 --> 00:02:00,094
Oh, boy! l love Halloween.

29
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,896
Lots of haunted happenings
around town.

30
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,869
Why, Chernobog
threw a big party.

31
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,667
You know,
it's easy to get to his house.

32
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,265
Just make a right
on Bald Mountain.

33
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:11,938
lt's funny, because it's true.

34
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,536
Why, l even saw Hades.

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,707
He was really
painting the town dead.

36
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,683
Love that.

37
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,651
Hey, l also heard
there's a big shindig...

38
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:21,415
over at
the elephant graveyard.

39
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:25,255
lt's B.Y.O.B.
Bring your own bones.

40
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:30,026
And now
let's start off the fun...

41
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,429
with this
tricky Halloween tale.

42
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:57,450
Boo.

43
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:14,066
What manner of ghoul is this?

44
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,448
Uh-oh. The boys.

45
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,195
Hello, boys.

46
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,098
Trick or treat!

47
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,160
For you...

48
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,866
and you and you.

49
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,772
Thank you, Uncle Donald.

50
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,871
Whoa, Beelzebub. Whoa.

51
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,350
Steady there, old boy.

52
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,151
Now here's your treat.

53
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,393
So long, boys.

54
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:11,386
Oh, bless
their little black hearts.

55
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:14,559
l saw the whole thing, kids.

56
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,593
Down, Beelzebub.
Down, please. Thank you.

57
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,628
Oh, look, a real witch.

58
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:24,372
Oh, joy!
Thou do believeth in witches.

59
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:29,906
Just for that,
l'll help thee get thy candy.

60
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,941
Uh-oh. Another one.

61
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,980
My name, sir, is Hazel.

62
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:39,082
Witch Hazel, that is.

63
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:49,526
That quacking rogue
is tougher than l thought.

64
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,002
Now come here, boys.

65
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,732
l'll tell you
what l'm going to do.

66
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,935
l need some very
gruesome ingredients--

67
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,001
a cauldron of swamp water...

68
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,604
Double, double,
toil and trouble.

69
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,945
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

70
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,247
Eye of needle,
tongue of shoe...

71
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:07,810
hand of clock
that points at 2:00.

72
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:09,583
This is the real thing,
you know.

73
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,955
Right out of Shakespeare.

74
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:15,928
Neck of bottle,
tail of coat...

75
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,897
whiskers from the billy goat.

76
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:22,301
Here you are, Hazel.

77
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:25,600
Repulsive.

78
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,443
Delightfully gruesome reaction.

79
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,948
Kids, this stuff's loaded.

80
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,191
Oh, boy!

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,895
Boy, this is fun!

82
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,732
What in the heck is that?

83
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:05,106
-Attaboy, Beelzebub!
-Oh, boy!

84
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:08,672
Oh, l don't believe it.

85
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,706
Trick or treat,
trick or treat

86
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,150
Trick or treat
for Halloween

87
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,711
When the pumpkin shells
cast evil spells

88
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,590
Your little white house
turns green

89
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:23,960
Your little white house
turns green

90
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,760
This is too--

91
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,029
Every post is a ghost

92
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,628
lf you got a witch's brew

93
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,332
And if you want your gate
to circulate

94
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:35,807
Ho, ho, we can do that, too

95
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,070
Trick or treat,
trick or treat

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,441
Trick or treat,
trick or treat

97
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,309
Trick or treat
for Halloween

98
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:43,611
When ghosts and goblins
by the score

99
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,084
Ring the bell
on your front door

100
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,848
You better not be stingy

101
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:51,118
Or your nightmares
will come true

102
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:57,425
Now, are you going
to treat...or not?

103
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,864
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

104
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,367
Oh, my goodness.
Ghosts and goblins.

105
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,097
l don't understand.

106
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:07,903
Kids,
this pigeon's a pushover.

107
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,171
Pushover?

108
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,210
The key.

109
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:26,355
l just been a-itchin'
to cast a spell on you.

110
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,659
Hocus pocus, magic shower.

111
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,961
Put his feet within my power.

112
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:41,002
Hey, what was that stuff?

113
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,268
Feet...

114
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:45,133
Kick out that key.

115
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:52,810
Yippee! Look at him dance!

116
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,349
Oh, dance with your feet
just as fast as you can

117
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,689
Now flip 'em
like a flapjack in a pan

118
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,287
Oh, a-hoppin' and a-jumpin'
like a flea on a griddle

119
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,729
The key for the door
is the key for the vittles

120
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,930
Do-si-do,
now mind the rules

121
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,406
With your old flat feet
just a-kickin' like mules

122
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,240
Oh, promenade
a-way out west

123
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,874
That's where the cactus
grows the best

124
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:27,612
Now swing down south
and turn on the heat

125
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,115
Stop!

126
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:37,494
Now end the dance
and take your seat

127
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:44,094
-Nothing to it.
-Oh, yeah?

128
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:50,072
Now you've made old Hazel mad.

129
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:53,476
l'll cast a spell
that's double grim.

130
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:58,348
Smash that door down, feet...
with him.

131
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,249
Get out. No, you don't.

132
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:07,486
This hurts me worse
than it does you.

133
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,893
Now take a longer start--

134
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,124
about a mile or two!

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,130
Get ready, kids. Here he comes.

136
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,979
l thought
he'd listen to reason.

137
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,714
Hooray for Uncle Donald.

138
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,348
l won't do it.

139
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,228
Come, Beelzebub.
lt's nearly dawn.

140
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:43,991
Dear, l mustn't be late.
Goodness, me.

141
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,225
Good-bye, kids.

142
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:51,765
So when ghosts and goblins
by the score

143
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:53,863
Ring your bell
or pound your door

144
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,340
Better not be stingy

145
00:09:55,375 --> 00:10:00,438
Or your nightmares
will come true

146
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,674
Boo!

147
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:09,018
Oh, boy. Somebody to scare.

148
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,421
Boo!

149
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:16,118
Halloween treats
can be really spooky...

150
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,460
like mechanical houses
that act kind of kooky.

151
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:21,228
So, sit back, relax,
and let's take a lookie.

152
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,268
ln a humble little house
that needed some paint...

153
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:28,001
lived a tired Mickey Mouse
trying to sleep...

154
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,406
but he cain't.

155
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,239
You see,
the problems were plenty...

156
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:32,767
in this house that he had.

157
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,803
The roof always creaked...

158
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:37,077
and the drafts, they were bad.

159
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,949
The furnace turned on
with a clatter and clunk...

160
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:43,752
making pipes sputter,
steam, rattle, and plunk.

161
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,918
With a slap and a bang,
the shutters did slam.

162
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,418
This noise,
it continued ad nauseam.

163
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:53,762
He rolled and he tossed
under his pillow and sheets.

164
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,099
Poor Mickey was wishing
the sounds they would cease.

165
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,832
l can't take this racket
another night longer.

166
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,340
l thought that l could,
but l couldn't be wronger.

167
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,344
He threw off his blankets
and slunk to the sink.

168
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,846
Perhaps l'll feel better
after a drink.

169
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,713
But the water came out
in a way unexpected.

170
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,447
lt sprayed from the drain
in his face, misdirected.

171
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,955
He wiped off his mug
in angry defeat.

172
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,118
That's the last straw.
My decision's complete.

173
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,855
l'm fed up with clanking,
ker-slamming, and squeaking.

174
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,625
The whistling and knocking
and roof always creaking.

175
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,828
Poor Mickey was irked--
a bit peeved, you might say.

176
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:31,735
His mind was made up
that he must move away.

177
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,763
So, he gathered his things
and emptied each drawer.

178
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:39,141
The last thing he did
was lock the front door.

179
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,510
Then Pluto and he
marched up the next street...

180
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:45,347
where new houses stood
all spiffy and neat.

181
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:48,445
He found a nice dwelling
that drew his attention...

182
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:52,185
with automatic devices
of the latest invention.

183
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:53,715
This house is electric.

184
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,819
Said the salesman with pride.

185
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,888
lf you push this red button,
you'll travel inside.

186
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,627
With the flick of a switch
and the pull of a lever...

187
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,795
the house, it transformed.

188
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,498
This is really quite clever.

189
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,702
The design's ergonomic--
for comfort, you see.

190
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,733
Grinned the salesman
as he pushed...

191
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,769
buttons one, two, and three.

192
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,680
The furniture
folds right into the wall.

193
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:19,412
lt makes a great shortcut
into the hall.

194
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:21,079
This kitchen is sparkling.

195
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,712
lt's synthetic steel.

196
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,849
There's even a robot
who can cook you a meal.

197
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:28,156
But how will the floors here
all stay so clean?

198
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:31,459
Should dust ever settle,
there's a vacuum machine.

199
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:34,591
Are there shutters that
bang, slap, rattle, or slam?

200
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:38,365
Not a one, not a bit,
not at all, my good man.

201
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:39,837
l'll take this new house.

202
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,396
Said Mickey with zeal.

203
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,877
After escrow and closing,
the contract was sealed.

204
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,903
This newfangled house
is now where l'll stay.

205
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:51,348
He then thanked the salesman
and sent him away.

206
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:54,217
So, Mickey settled back
in his modern recliner...

207
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,153
with buttons galore.

208
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:57,850
Ah, what could be finer?

209
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,415
Whatever he wanted
was his right away.

210
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,691
With a touch of a button,
he got a snack tray.

211
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,994
His chair, it reclined
and rubbed his back so...

212
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:11,265
then on came some music
and dimmed the lights low.

213
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:14,535
Said Mickey with a yawn,
as he scratched on his head...

214
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:18,101
Oh, it's time for a bath,
then l'll toddle to bed.

215
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:21,011
He pressed the red button
and rolled across the floor.

216
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:25,245
His chair went upstairs
through the new bathroom door.

217
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:29,220
With a splash and a splunk,
the brushes did clean.

218
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:32,224
What a wonderful thing,
this bathing machine.

219
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,785
Special arms then conveyed him
off to his bed...

220
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:37,090
and tucked him in gently...

221
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,893
then a story was read.

222
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:42,025
Mickey was cozy,
all snuggled up tight...

223
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:46,437
but he tossed and he turned
as his thoughts did excite...

224
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:48,770
of buttons and switches
and moveable stairs...

225
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:53,108
computer controls
on reclining chairs.

226
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,410
There's so many things
in this house with to play.

227
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,916
l want to stay up.
l'll just sleep in the day.

228
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,287
He leapt from his covers
and slid past the clock.

229
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:04,415
He flung open the door,
but discovered it blocked.

230
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:07,255
There stood the robot.
lts finger, it wagged.

231
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,820
Before Mickey knew it,
by the seat, he was grabbed.

232
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:13,058
This just isn't right.
l don't need a rest.

233
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:15,829
l want to get up.
Stop being a pest.

234
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:18,602
Mickey scampered away...

235
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,162
heading
straight for the door...

236
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:23,767
but the robot was fast
and stopped him once more.

237
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,039
Bedtime is fine,
but this is my house.

238
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,481
You're making me angry.
Don't cheese off this mouse.

239
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:33,314
So, he turned and he climbed
out of the open window...

240
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:36,879
and snuck away quietly
on tippy tiptoe.

241
00:14:36,923 --> 00:14:40,518
But little did he think
that out in the back...

242
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,825
the robot was waiting
for another attack.

243
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:46,229
Enough is enough.
l'll take this no more.

244
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:49,291
lf you want to play rough,
get ready for war.

245
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,702
A bucket of water--
that's just the right thing.

246
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,470
When the robot comes in,
l'll pull on the string.

247
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,479
Mickey readied his plan
with his own little trap.

248
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:03,175
The robot came in,
and then with a snap...

249
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,616
the bucket tipped over
and water came out.

250
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:10,179
lt splashed, and it soaked him
completely throughout.

251
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:13,317
He sparked and he fizzed,
that man made of steel.

252
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:17,193
He jolted and volted
and began to unreel.

253
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,791
Electricity surged
in the house all about...

254
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,700
zapping the circuits
and shorting them out.

255
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:27,069
Food from the fridge
was flung in the air.

256
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,837
lt splattered and spatted
in the poor mouse's hair.

257
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:33,845
He ducked and he dodged,
but he could not escape.

258
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:37,645
The jelly that hit him
was cherry, not grape.

259
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:42,046
Back into the bath,
he was dragged very quick...

260
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:45,888
and repeatedly scrubbed
with a soap on a stick.

261
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:48,689
All sudsy and wet,
Mickey Mouse tried to flee...

262
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:52,687
but the vacuum was now
on a housecleaning spree.

263
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:56,133
The hoses, they swung,
they flailed, and they sucked.

264
00:15:56,168 --> 00:16:00,969
The brushes whooshed past,
forcing Mickey to duck.

265
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,669
He grabbed up a lamp
and began to fight back...

266
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,702
but right at that moment,
the recliner attacked.

267
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:10,215
Mechanical hands
squeezed him up tight...

268
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:14,515
but Mickey was valiant--
he put up a fight.

269
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,418
When things
looked their bleakest...

270
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,150
and all hope seemed lost...

271
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,057
Mickey picked up the chair
and gave it a toss.

272
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:24,620
lt hit the controls
and smashed them to bits.

273
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:28,100
The buttons, they flashed
and flickered in fits.

274
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:31,297
Mickey spotted his chance
to get safely away.

275
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:35,137
He snatched up his dog,
and then he did say...

276
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:37,802
This place is a monster,
not what l'd call home.

277
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:41,370
He watched that new house
shake, sputter, and groan.

278
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:45,214
lt fell with a crash
in less than a minute.

279
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:46,878
He turned to his pup
and said...

280
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,046
Glad we weren't in it.

281
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:52,888
Dejected and sad,
they both strode away...

282
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:56,884
Mickey and Pluto,
with nowhere to stay.

283
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,659
The rays of the morning
added sunlight...

284
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,635
greeting Mickey Mouse
with a warm, friendly sight.

285
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:06,638
A little wood house
that needed some paint.

286
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:11,268
lt wasn't quite perfect,
but still, it was great.

287
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,541
Aw, we could stay here
just for a while.

288
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,414
Said Mickey to Pluto
with a wry little smile.

289
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:21,079
Later that night,
all warm in his bed...

290
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,954
Mickey Mouse snuggled up
as sleep came to his head.

291
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,983
The furnace, it clanked.
lt rattled and shocked.

292
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,861
The shutters flew back.
They slammed, and they knocked.

293
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:35,094
The wind, it did whistle,
round the chimney it moaned...

294
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,261
but Mickey didn't stir...

295
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:39,965
'cause he knew he was home.

296
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:52,413
We've got our eye on you.

297
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:57,679
Aw, phooey.
l'll never be scary.

298
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,918
Donald may be trying
to scare everybody...

299
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,860
but here's a story
where he gets spooked himself.

300
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,329
The following presentation...

301
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:08,128
will demonstrate
how to haunt the living.

302
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,068
But before we begin,
one must be...

303
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:18,942
not living.

304
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:27,781
The fine specimen observed here
is commonly known as a ghost.

305
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,812
Ghost? Where?

306
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,518
-Why, you, my friend.
-Me?

307
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,723
Yes, you have just joined
the ranks of the supernatural.

308
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:41,995
That explains what
all that racket was out there.

309
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:46,061
Hey! l'm not ready
to be dearly departed.

310
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,131
Don't you worry.
lt's only temporary.

311
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,473
Just long enough for you
to demonstrate...

312
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:56,780
Step one--

313
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:00,380
Finding the right house...

314
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,877
is all about
location, location, location.

315
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:10,294
And what better place to look
than the classified ads?

316
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,126
Let's see here.

317
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:13,859
''Creaking hardwood floors...

318
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,924
''fog-enshrouded
breakfast nook...

319
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,595
''informal dying room.''

320
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,536
Perfect!

321
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,699
Oh, a-hauntin' l will go

322
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,571
A-hauntin' l will go

323
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,736
Hi, ho, the merry-o

324
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:30,746
A-hauntin' l will go

325
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:32,751
Step two--

326
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:39,921
Hauntee number one
is a likeable mouse...

327
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,018
and popular American icon.

328
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,926
Oh, gosh, l'm scared.

329
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:47,831
Hauntee number two is a cow
who's a real moo-ver and shaker.

330
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,767
l'm scared, too.

331
00:19:49,802 --> 00:19:51,793
And finally,
hauntee number three...

332
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,806
is a hot-headed duck
who's a real quack-up.

333
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,866
Aw, phooey. Nothing scares me.

334
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:02,278
l know who
l'm going to pick on.

335
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,279
Step three--

336
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:13,289
Nothing is quite creepier
than the creaky front door...

337
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,759
which opens all by itself.

338
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,367
Here goes.

339
00:20:23,836 --> 00:20:28,535
Oh, automatic doors.
How convenient.

340
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,304
Having successfully creeped
your intended hauntee out...

341
00:20:35,347 --> 00:20:37,440
you're now ready for...

342
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,815
Step four--

343
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:47,015
With an ordinary bedsheet
carefully draped over you...

344
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,085
sneak about
in a menacing manner.

345
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:54,396
Hit my head!

346
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:05,240
Continue this macabre
dance of the dead...

347
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:08,940
and watch as panic and terror
wash over your victim.

348
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:12,882
This method of haunting...

349
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:16,410
is only made possible
by the unique eyeholes...

350
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,047
that have been cut in the sheet.

351
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,923
Eyeholes? Now you tell me.

352
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,019
Step five--

353
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,498
Everyone is afraid of the dark.

354
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:31,435
Use this knowledge
to your haunting advantage.

355
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,554
Oh, this is getting silly.

356
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,620
Step six--

357
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,501
Peace and quiet.

358
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,839
A ghost has
a wide array of scary sounds...

359
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:14,607
with which to frighten
their unwitting victim.

360
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:42,265
l just don't understand it.

361
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:53,206
Oh, come on.
l'm tired of being a ghost.

362
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:55,686
Hey, Donald, wake up.

363
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,293
What?

364
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,817
A ghost!

365
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,361
But, Donald--

366
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,835
No! Get away!

367
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:20,802
Sorry, Donald.

368
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,940
l just wanted to tell you
that l'm a ghost.

369
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:26,212
And now you are, too.

370
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,412
Why, you little--

371
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:30,547
Now, now, settle down, Donald.

372
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:32,318
lt's only temporary.

373
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:33,517
That's right.

374
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,153
Just long enough
to demonstrate...

375
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:39,993
Begin the end...

376
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,863
by chasing each other
into the distance...

377
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,232
then scream comically.

378
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:51,872
Followed by an iris out.

379
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:56,671
Everybody knows
there's only one thing...

380
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,444
to really be afraid of
on Halloween...

381
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:00,418
and that's ghosts--

382
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:03,649
especially when
they're the Lonesome Ghosts.

383
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,682
Aw, we don't have no fun
no more.

384
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:34,618
No. Nobody around here
to scare.

385
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:38,180
We scared 'em all away!
l guess we're too good!

386
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,390
Hey, here's an idea.
Get a load of this, fellas!

387
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:48,929
''Notice. We exterminate
all kinds of ghosts.

388
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,935
''Day and night service.''

389
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:55,473
Wise guys!
Let's get 'em over here.

390
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,667
And have some fun with them.

391
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,471
We'll scare the pants
off of 'em!

392
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,589
-The telephone!
-The telephone?

393
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:30,334
Do you chase ghosts?

394
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:33,811
Do we chase ghosts?

395
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:36,815
Yes, ma'am--Yes, sir!
l'll say we do!

396
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:40,341
Well, this house
is full of ghosts.

397
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:41,716
Listen.

398
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:51,186
Come quick.

399
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,357
The old McShiver mansion.

400
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:55,229
OK. We'll be right over.

401
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,326
Oh, boy! A customer!

402
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,564
-A customer!
-A customer?

403
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,764
Hey, fellas, here they come.

404
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,879
This oughta be a cinch.
Look at them!

405
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:27,960
We're from the Ajax
Ghost Exterminator...Company.

406
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:37,033
Waah! Why don't you look
where you're going?

407
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:57,858
-Ghosts.
-Ghosts.

408
00:26:57,896 --> 00:26:59,386
G-g-ghosts?

409
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:03,060
We'll separate
and surround them.

410
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:35,989
What's the big idea?
Who did that?

411
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:40,527
Come out
and fight like a man!

412
00:28:40,565 --> 00:28:42,897
You guys hear me?
Come on! Fight!

413
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:45,597
So...

414
00:28:47,406 --> 00:28:49,966
l got him! Oh, boy!

415
00:28:56,014 --> 00:28:57,845
Well, l'll be a son of a gun!

416
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,215
What kind of a place is this?

417
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,489
They can't do that to me!

418
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,097
That's a fine how-do-you-do!

419
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,765
l'm brave.

420
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:20,362
But l'm careful.

421
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,341
l ain't-a scared of no ghosts.

422
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:58,638
For a moment,
l thought it wasn't me.

423
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,721
Somethin' wrong here.

424
00:30:57,435 --> 00:31:00,029
l know you. You're a ghost.

425
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:35,103
They got me!
They pulled a knife on me!

426
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:38,132
Help, Mickey! l--l got 'em!

427
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,701
l got all three of 'em!
Help! Whoa!

428
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,489
-Ghosts!
-Ghosts!

429
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:21,545
So, you can't take it,
you big sissies!

430
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,392
So, Goofy,
having a spooky time?

431
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:37,026
Yup! But not as spooky
as the time l dressed up...

432
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:39,161
in those skintight
yellow leotards.

433
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,263
Right.

434
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:42,773
Hit it, Horace.

435
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:45,432
Say, isn't it time
for your Halloween trick?

436
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,839
Patience, lago. Midnight nears.

437
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:52,104
And now, put on
your best grim grins...

438
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:53,701
for this Halloween treat.

439
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:03,683
Attention all listeners.
Attention all listeners.

440
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:07,919
Ajax, the terrible gorilla
has escaped from the city zoo.

441
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:11,053
Be on the lookout.
This animal is a killer.

442
00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:13,529
That is all. Breckenridge.

443
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,305
Uncle Donald!

444
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:31,042
Where's Uncle Donald?

445
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:43,986
Why, that dirty...

446
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:54,164
This looks like
a pretty good story, by gosh.

447
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:56,366
lt's full of pictures, too.

448
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:03,171
''Once upon a time...''

449
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,510
''there was
a beautiful princess.''

450
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:11,954
Oh, ever so beautiful.

451
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,422
''She lived in a--''

452
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:40,750
Why, you...

453
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:49,626
Come on. Come on!

454
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,096
Take it off! Take it off!
Take it...off.

455
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:01,737
Oh, boys!

456
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,910
Speak to me!

457
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:18,078
Attention all listeners.

458
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:20,784
Remember, you can master
any wild animal...

459
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,157
by looking him
straight in the eye.

460
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:25,628
That is all. Breckenridge.

461
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:12,171
Get out of here!

462
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,201
Get going.

463
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:17,112
Shh! Not so loud!

464
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:19,378
Doggone those kids.

465
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:22,818
Why can't they do something
right once in a while?

466
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:22,704
Attention all listeners.

467
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,176
ln order to subdue Ajax,
use tear gas.

468
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,303
That is all. Breckenridge.

469
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:30,211
Spare me, spare me!

470
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:49,826
Amen.

471
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,894
lt's midnight...

472
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:29,599
and l've got a trick
for Mickey Mouse.

473
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,232
Sorry, Minnie,
but we don't want...

474
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:33,675
to be dull villains
on Halloween.

475
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:41,212
OK, everybody. Now it's time
for a change of pace.

476
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:42,651
Lights out!

477
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,647
Right you are, Mickey.

478
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,180
lt's Halloween, you know...

479
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:50,386
and with just
the right touch...

480
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,124
This could be
quite the place

481
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:56,224
Full of wholesome,
happy faces

482
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,394
Hanging out, feeling fine

483
00:45:58,436 --> 00:46:00,734
Where everyone's
a friend of mine

484
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:03,069
lnside this evil joint

485
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,507
Every guest
gets to the point

486
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,807
This day
will live in infamy

487
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:12,580
The House of Mouse
is history

488
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:17,345
lt's our house now

489
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:20,016
lt's our house now

490
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:22,184
lt's a fact
you can't ignore

491
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:24,194
Shut the windows,
lock the doors

492
00:46:24,228 --> 00:46:26,696
lt's our house now

493
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,198
Raise your mugs,
you thieves and thugs

494
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,531
Join
the rabble-rousing crowd

495
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:34,129
lt's our house now

496
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:38,631
All the coolest cats
fit in so perfectly

497
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:42,077
Every evil queen
gets due respect

498
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:43,410
Love your work.

499
00:46:43,447 --> 00:46:45,347
You'll forget your troubles

500
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,748
Put your trust in me

501
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:50,253
You've had your fun,
you've made your play

502
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,812
But every rodent
has his day

503
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,484
lt's our house now,
down and dirty

504
00:46:57,528 --> 00:46:59,928
lt's our house now,
me hearty

505
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:01,932
What a place
for breaking bread

506
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:03,126
Things are better

507
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,600
Off with their heads!

508
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:06,933
lt's our house now,
what a party

509
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,098
Join the fun
with no regrets

510
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,598
Only greedy dirty deeds
are allowed

511
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:13,905
Get those puppies!

512
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:16,378
-Game over, Mickey.
-Hit the road, Minnie!

513
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:17,675
Take a hike, chickies!

514
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:19,444
lt's our house now

515
00:47:19,483 --> 00:47:22,611
Don't bother comin' back,
it's our house now

516
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:32,758
Now that the House of Mouse
is our house...

517
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:35,697
things are going to be
a little different.

518
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:38,099
All right, Jafar.
You've had your fun.

519
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:40,035
Now l'm here
to set things right...

520
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,300
and l brought my boys.

521
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:45,035
So, are you gonna
get off my stage...

522
00:47:45,075 --> 00:47:48,272
or are we gonna
have to make you?

523
00:47:57,721 --> 00:47:59,621
Nice try, Mickey.

524
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:01,215
But you and Goofy...

525
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:02,919
and especially

are about to get a real fright.

527
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,587
Hippity-hoppity
Happy Halloween!

528
00:49:45,195 --> 00:49:49,029
Oh, Goofy!
Halloween's not for eggs!

529
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,465
lt's for candy!

530
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:53,061
Hmm. Candy.

531
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:58,534
There's one last house.

532
00:49:58,575 --> 00:50:00,566
Yep! Uncle Donald's place.

533
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,102
Trick or treat!

534
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:12,453
What a stingy grouch.

535
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:30,739
We lost him!

536
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:33,299
Hey, what about Uncle Donald?

537
00:50:33,344 --> 00:50:34,606
We gotta warn him!

538
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:44,644
Boy, oh, boy, did l scare them!

539
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:10,073
So, that's the trick, eh?

540
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:11,979
OK, here's what we're gonna do.

541
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:48,346
Oh, boy! More candy!

542
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:57,483
Three young ducks

543
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:58,688
You seen this fella?

544
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:03,094
No? Then try this!

545
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,532
Wait!

546
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:11,799
Ow! l can explain.

00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,969
Just as l suspicioned.

00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:16,138
You're under arrest, laddie!

549
00:52:18,782 --> 00:52:20,409
Come back, you maniac!

550
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:30,355

555
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:31,684
A cemetery?!

556
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,019
Oh, no!

557
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:37,451
Huey, Dewey, and Louie?

558
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:48,294
Uncle Donald...

559
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:49,737
You scared us...

560
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:51,866
To death!

561
00:54:39,623 --> 00:54:42,854
Hope you liked our candy,
Uncle Donald.

562
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:44,360
The selfish one shall die.

563
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:47,625
Oh, l'm sorry, boys.

564
00:54:47,664 --> 00:54:50,929
-l'll get your candy back.
-All of it?

565
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:55,769
Cross my heart and hope to die.

566
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:02,840
Trick or treat.

567
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:17,192
Where'd everyone go?

568
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:18,455
Oh, well.

569
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:22,761
Ho ho ho!
Happy Halloween!

570
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,971
Now what do we do?

571
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:35,638
Step aside, boys.
l'll take care of that Jafar.

572
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,341
Gorsh,
l've never seen her so mad.

573
00:55:38,382 --> 00:55:39,576
Whoo, l have.

574
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:42,983
And now,
l've saved the best for last.

575
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,920
Listen, you!

576
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:46,752

and all the other villains...

577
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:48,485
just thirty seconds
to turn this back...

578
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:51,187
into the House of Mouse,
starting right now!

579
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:54,686
Thirty, twenty-nine,
twenty-eight, twenty-seven...

580
00:55:54,731 --> 00:55:59,031
twenty-six, twenty-five,
twenty-four, twenty-three...

581
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:01,333
Now let's heat things up
with a twisted tale...

582
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:04,670
that Mickey and Minnie
will find a real scream!

583
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:07,267
Roll it, Big Bad!

584
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,299
Get 'em, Mickey.

585
01:02:57,153 --> 01:03:00,213
-Mickey's hat!
-Oh, what do we do now?

586
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:06,118
Here, use the lamp!

587
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:12,226
Mickey, catch!

588
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:15,137
The lamp will hold him forever!

589
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:16,365
The lamp!

590
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:44,526
You're the only leader
of this club, Mickey.

591
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:46,228
Aw, it was nothin'.

592
01:03:46,269 --> 01:03:49,261
Anything to make sure
we have a happy Halloween.

593
01:03:49,305 --> 01:03:51,000
Boo!

594
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,099
Aw, nice costume, Donald...

595
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:54,906

already beat you to it.

596
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:58,644
Aw, phooey!
