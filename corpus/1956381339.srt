with the weight of the dragon

87

as he crawled to the water,

88
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:25,680
and a cloud of venom
flew before him

89
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:28,448
as he snorted and roared!

90
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:30,314
But Sigurd waited

91
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:33,249
till the dragon had
crawled over the pit

92
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:37,714
and then he thrust his sword
under his left shoulder

93
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,247
and right into his heart.

94
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:42,878
The dragon lashed his tail
till stones broke

95
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,415
and trees crashed about him.

96
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:49,314
And then he spoke, as he died,

97
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:52,815
and said, "Whoever thou art

98
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,015

"I would touch none of it,

I should never die.

362
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:30,481
She hasn't heard
from him in weeks.

363
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:33,448
And he's not responded
to my letters.

nothing to do with you.

is he, sir?

It's something else.

00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:49,612
I'm sure Master Gilson
has no need for a scholarship.

890
00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:51,478
As for Geoffrey Smith...

891
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,909
This has nothing to do
with my friends.

892
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:55,779
We encourage each other,
we push each other on.

893
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,480
Your fellow lodger.

894
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,112
Miss Bratt.

895
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,479
No, Edith has nothing to do
with my failing that exam.

896
00:53:05,745 --> 00:53:09,112
You were seen coming out
of her room. At night.

897
00:53:09,346 --> 00:53:10,413
We talked.

898
00:53:10,713 --> 00:53:11,944
We talk to each other.

899
00:53:11,946 --> 00:53:13,744
- Oh. So, it's true.
- Yes, of course it's true.

900
00:53:13,746 --> 00:53:15,043
- It doesn't...
- The night before the exam,

901
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:16,943
you accompanied her
to the concert hall.

902
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,479
That, also,
has nothing to do with this?

903
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:22,479
(SIGHS) She's not even
Catholic, Ronald.

904
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:26,113
Your mother

905
00:53:26,944 --> 00:53:28,079
made a sacrifice.

906
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:30,510
She knew she was dying

907
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:34,045
and she trusted your future
and education to me.

908
00:53:34,613 --> 00:53:36,580
I intend to honor that.

909
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:39,877
The time has come
for you to choose

910
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:42,547
whether or not you will follow
in her example.

911
00:53:43,278 --> 00:53:45,243
I don't think I understand.

912
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:46,410
I must ask you

913
00:53:46,412 --> 00:53:47,910
to have nothing more
to do with Miss Bratt.

914
00:53:47,912 --> 00:53:50,775
That's ridiculous.
That's completely unfair.

915
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,078
- Nevertheless.
- No. No, I...

916
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,643
I can't. I won't.

917
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:56,344
I am your legal guardian...

918
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:57,877
Yes, but you don't understand.

919
00:53:57,879 --> 00:54:00,212
- Oh, I understand perfectly.
- No. Father. (SIGHS)

920
00:54:01,878 --> 00:54:02,979
I love her.

921
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:08,213
I wish...

922
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:10,711
Ronald, I wish you could enjoy

923
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,645
the same luxuries
other boys do.

924
00:54:12,647 --> 00:54:15,410
- I wish...
- No, you're jealous.

925
00:54:15,412 --> 00:54:17,044
You don't want that at all.
You're jealous.

926
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:18,743
You say that but you don't
mean it. You're a priest.

927
00:54:18,745 --> 00:54:20,443
You don't know anything
about love. How could you?

928
00:54:20,445 --> 00:54:21,844
- Listen to me.
- You want me to be alone.

929
00:54:21,846 --> 00:54:23,576
You want me to live alone
like you and have nothing.

930
00:54:23,578 --> 00:54:24,877
I won't.
I won't live like that.

931
00:54:24,879 --> 00:54:27,610
If after the age of 21,
you still feel the same way,

932
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:30,613
you are, of course,
free to do as you please.

933
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:33,778
Until that time,

934
00:54:34,178 --> 00:54:35,842
you have a duty to fulfill.

935
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:38,045
And you will fulfill it,
Ronald.

936
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,613
So, help me God,
you will fulfill it.

937
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:52,078
TOLKIEN:
<i>I can't fail it again.</i>

938
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:54,979
And you know what will happen
if I don't get into Oxford.

939
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,443
I could become a priest,

940
00:55:00,445 --> 00:55:01,709
but I don't think
a life of celibacy

941
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:03,479
is what either of us
had in mind.

942
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:07,878
Edith?

943
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,143
Edith, it's just until
I reach my majority.

944
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:17,679
Oh, for God's sake, Ronald.

945
00:55:18,012 --> 00:55:19,480
Don't be so dramatic.

946
00:55:21,546 --> 00:55:22,844
It doesn't matter.

947
00:55:22,846 --> 00:55:24,675
No, don't say that.
Of course, it matters.

948
00:55:24,677 --> 00:55:26,712
I don't know why
you're taking it so hard.

949
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:29,979
Things are just returning
to normal, that's all.

950
00:55:30,212 --> 00:55:31,378
To reality.

951
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,210
No, I won't give up
on our future. (SIGHS)

952
00:55:34,212 --> 00:55:35,213
That's why I'm...

953
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:38,480
I refuse to give up on that.

954
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:43,179
Of course, you will.

955
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:46,646
More quickly than you think.

956
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,009
- So will I.
- No, that's not true.

957
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:53,546
Edith, please. Look...

958
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:57,279
I let myself believe

959
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:59,613
that there were happy endings
for people like us.

960
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:01,613
But there aren't.

961
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:02,779
There can't be.

962
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,212
But you get your happy ending.

963
00:56:10,679 --> 00:56:12,611
Hope you enjoy Oxford.

964
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:15,446
No. Edith.

00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:43,380
I need to rest, Sam.

968
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:45,778
You have to find Geoffrey.

- Sam.
- I'm not leaving you here.

Sam. It's an order.

972
00:56:52,845 --> 00:56:56,012
Find Geoffrey
and tell him not to lose hope.

973
00:56:58,246 --> 00:57:00,578
Tell him that
the T.C.B.S., we...

974
00:57:03,611 --> 00:57:05,012
Just keep him alive.

- It's a dragon. It's a dragon.

CHRISTOPHER:
For goodness' sake.

978
00:57:35,612 --> 00:57:37,910
I was wondering,
did I mention before...

979
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,577
The set of the play is
very much inspired

980
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:40,844
by the architecture
of Trinity.

981
00:57:40,846 --> 00:57:41,676
Sorry, chaps.

982
00:57:41,678 --> 00:57:43,978
- But what's it about?
- Well...

983
00:57:44,178 --> 00:57:47,077
- And so, you're the poet?
- No, uh, that's Geoffrey.

984
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:49,612
I think you Oxford men
should be upping the game. No?

985
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:51,576
- Where are we off to next?
- Yes, do tell.

986
00:57:51,578 --> 00:57:53,742
Yes, where shall we...?
Sorry, excuse me.

987
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:54,879
Um...

988
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,712

- CHRISTOPHER: Hurry up!

GEOFFREY: Shh!

993
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:09,875
I think that particular match
it was the Oxford men

00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:11,809
- versus the Cambridge boys.

997
00:58:15,878 --> 00:58:18,509
the third Oxford council
of the T.C.B.S.

998
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:20,445
well and truly open.

999
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:21,776
And would like to welcome

1000
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:23,411
our damsels
from the Eagle and Child

1001
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:24,544
as honorary guests.

1002
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,575
May all our meetings
take place

1003
00:58:26,577 --> 00:58:27,645
on an abandoned omnibus.

1004
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,476
I think the word "abandoned"
might be stretching it.

- Maybe a bit.

- Oh.

- I apologize for my friend.

- He's pining for someone.
- What?

1011
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:44,610
CHRISTOPHER: He's pining
for the delectable Miss Bratt.

1012
00:58:44,612 --> 00:58:45,677
ROBERT: Take no notice of him.

1013
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:46,876
Who's the delectable
Miss Bratt?

1014
00:58:46,878 --> 00:58:48,409
- She's no one.
- Oh, is she, Tollers?

00:58:48,411 --> 00:58:49,510
The way you've been
moping around

1016
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:50,512
for the past couple of months.

1017
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:52,209
It's not very nice
to talk about another lady

1018
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:53,212

1019
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:55,013
No, you're absolutely right.

of a beautiful girl

1022

and he can't even
remember her name.

00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:02,044

- CHRISTOPHER: Edith or Oxford.

and your best friends. For
God's sake, enjoy yourself!

1033
00:59:16,744 --> 00:59:17,812

getting out of hand.

1034
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:19,875
- Don't talk about things you...
- Thank you. This was wonderful.

1035
00:59:19,877 --> 00:59:21,309
You let her go.
You didn't want her

1036
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:22,279
- more than you wanted Oxford.
- No.

1037
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,243
- I didn't have a choice.
- Does that make you a rotter?

1038
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:25,442
Does that make you
something else?

1039
00:59:25,444 --> 00:59:27,410
- What's the matter with you?
- Just shut up!

- Are you all right?

1043
00:59:35,445 --> 00:59:36,543
For an intellectual,

1044
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:38,211
you've quite
an impressive right hook.

00:59:38,213 --> 00:59:39,877
- Hit me back. Please.
- No.

1046
00:59:39,879 --> 00:59:41,579
Hit me back right now.
Please, Chris.

1047
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:43,609
- Forget it. Forget it.

1054
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,446
Yes, absolutely.

1055
01:00:04,812 --> 01:00:05,844
Exactly.

1056
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:08,745
ROBERT: This is more than...
just a friendship.

1057
01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:10,612
It's an alliance.

1058
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:13,778

- No, it's not your fault.
- No, it is.

in the ancient Greeks.

my scholarship.

my own studies.

- God. You were there.

even been flattered.

1305

with your permission,

1670
01:40:07,342 --> 01:40:08,907
perhaps I might try to get

1671
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:10,743
a volume
of his poems published.

1672
01:40:12,644 --> 01:40:14,144

1673
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:17,309
I think he was...

1674
01:40:17,843 --> 01:40:18,710

to people's attention.

write the foreword myself.

1678

I'm inclined to say no,
Mr. Tolkien.

I think it's important.

if that was where Geoffrey...

I'm sorry, I can't see what
possible good it would do.

extraordinary good.
