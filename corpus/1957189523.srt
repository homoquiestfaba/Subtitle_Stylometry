- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:18,827
No, no, no!

11
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,137
Not a good time
to give up on me.

12
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:28,413
No, no, no.

13
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:32,551
[rifle cocks]

14
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:36,206
Well, this is one hell
of an embarrassing thing.

15
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:38,448
Me standing here,
the near dead horse and all.

16
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:39,793
- Hmph! Sure is.

17
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,103
- Don't try nothing, boy.

18
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,413
- In no position
to try anything.

19
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:49,482
[shackles jangle]

20
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:51,034
[lawman grunts]

21
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:53,655
- Hey, what ya doing?
- Thanks for the ride.

22
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:54,896
- He's getting away!
- Gentleman.

23
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:56,655
- Get off that horse!

24
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:58,172
You're welcome.

25
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:00,793
- Pinkerton Agent:
Don't look so slick now.

26
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:04,931
- Got it worked out
real good.

27
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,275
[chains jingling]

28
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,034
- Robert LeRoy Butch Parker.

29
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,310
You've been with us a year.

30
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,689
And I see here
that your father's

31
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:23,137
a preacher back in Utah.

32
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:25,620
I'm assuming that he raised
you to be an honorable

33
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:26,724
and God-fearing man.

34
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,068
Yeah, all right, maybe you
rode off the trail a bit.

35
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:31,655
But, because of your youth

36
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:33,379
and this being
your first offense,

37
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:35,758
I'm willing to give
you a second chance.

38
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:37,724
I'll see fit to
give you a pardon.

39
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:39,965
if you'd give me you word
you'll break no more laws.

40
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,931
- I can't make that
promise, your honor.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,172
- What?

42
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,896
- My father did raise
me to know the value

43
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:51,103
of keeping my word.

44
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,689
So I just can't stand
here and tell you

45
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,517
I'm gonna be able to go
on the straight and narrow

46
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:56,068
when I don't know
if I really can.

47
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:58,172
I wouldn't want to lie
to you, your honor.

48
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,862
But I tell you what,

49
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:09,310
if you let me go I
will give you my word

50
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,896
that I won't commit any
more crimes in Wyoming.

51
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,827
- Well, I believe
that's good enough

52
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,172
for the state of Wyoming.

53
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:27,586
[crows cawing]

54
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:37,103
[hoofbeats]

55
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,172
- I told you not
to run off on your own.

56
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:43,758
You don't learn
too quick, do ya?

57
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:45,758
- Well, I'm smarter now.

58
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:49,482
- And it cost you a year of
your life to learn that lesson.

59
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:51,034
Get on.

60
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:53,482
- I don't think I can ride
with any more, Mr. Cassidy.

61
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,827
I promised the governor
I wouldn't commit

62
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,965
any more crimes in Wyoming.

63
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,931
- Well, Butch, my boy,

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,344
I found us a beautiful
little hideaway,

65
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,793
right on the border of
Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah.

66
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:07,827
So you don't have to
do anything in Wyoming

67
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:08,965
you don't want to.

68
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:12,827
- Gimme the reins.

69
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:17,241
[Cassidy chuckles]

70
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,517
[woman]
Boys, calm down.

71
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:33,965
Please stop your fussing
and hold still.

72
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,827
-Jessie, just... let's
put your shawl on.

73
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,137
- [children fussing]
- There, you look beautiful.

74
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:40,000
[fussing continues]

75
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,931
Boys, if you just
hold still, please.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,655
Children, just hold
still for one minute.

77
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,551
It's just a photograph,
I promise it won't hurt a bit.

78
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,827
[children yelling]

79
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,689
- [gunshot]
- [dramatic music playing]

80
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:14,413
- Well, now that
we got your attention,

81
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:17,655
you all better do it what
this young lady wants,

82
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,551
or I'ma shoot
someone's ears off.

83
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:26,620
- Starting with you.
- [boy gasps]

84
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,448
[gunshot]

85
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,241
- Harry Longabaugh.

86
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,724
That was an irresponsible,
patently dangerous,

87
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,965
and just a damn
foolish thing to do.

88
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,551
- My specialty.

89
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,586
[children giggle and groan]

90
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:54,448
[flashbulb puffs]

91
00:05:54,517 --> 00:05:57,000
[tools clammoring]

92
00:05:57,068 --> 00:06:00,000
- Really all that fancy gunplay
hasn't helped get you a job.

93
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,551
- More to life than
getting a job, Etta.

94
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,517
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:05,827
- I'm just kidding, honey.

96
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,793
Besides, these guns may
just prove you wrong.

97
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,896
- What are you talking about?

98
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,758
- I heard about a job in town.

99
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,551
Big outfit, need my guns.

100
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,310
- A hired gun, Harry?

101
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:20,551
- No, honey, I'm protecting
a dude city slicker's ranch

102
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,793
from coyotes and such..

103
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:23,827
I'm going over there now.

104
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:26,586
Just think,
have money coming in,

105
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,448
get a new house.

106
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:32,241
- What about my
sister, Mary Margaret?

107
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,482
Can't get married until
she finds someone first.

108
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,793
She's my elder.

109
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,827
- She's a wild cat.

110
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,482
- Harry, I'm serious.

111
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:47,482
So's you don't forget.

112
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,620
She just needs someone who
loves her to settle her down.

113
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,344
-Uh-huh.
-Like I did for you.

114
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,862
Maybe someone
at your new job.

115
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,620
- I don't...
- Good, stable, reliable man.

116
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,413
- Okay, I keep
my eyes peeled.

117
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:03,620
- Okay.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,034
[Harry laughs]

119
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,655
- I can tell you right now.

120
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,482
I wouldn't set anyone
I like up with you sister.

121
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:14,344
- Heh! Get on your way.
[horse huffs]

122
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:16,724
- Hyah!
Coming through.

123
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,758
Move it! Hyah!

124
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:21,862
[gentle music playing]

125
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:35,586
[gunfire in distance]

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,862
- See that pumpkin, boys?
He's smiling at ya!

127
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,827
[men laugh
and cheer softly]

128
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,655
- [man] That's five bucks
today, sunny boy.

129
00:07:48,724 --> 00:07:50,655
Got that one shoot.

130
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,862
That's a pistol
not a whirligig.

131
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,344
[gunfire continues]

132
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,827
- Man: Very nice!

133
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,551
- Well... what do you think?

134
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,931
- One hell of a wild bunch.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,275
- Yeah, the Wild Bunch.

136
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,793
Those the kind of men
we need.

137
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,965
Ain't a-one of them that ain't
wilder than you, ole Butch.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,965
- Well, Mike, you
taught me all I know.

139
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,448
But I had a lot of time
to think about my life

140
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,724
while I was in prison,

141
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,896
and I'm not sure I want
to do this anymore.

142
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:27,068
- I'll abide
by your decision.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,655
While you're thinking
about it...

144
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,517
you mind getting their
attention for me?

145
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,517
- Hey, hey, hey!
We got a new player.

146
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:39,517
[overlapping chatter]

147
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,793
[gunfire]

148
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:45,103
[men whooping]

149
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:47,896
- Man #1: Ooh, doggy.
Whoo!

150
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,965
- Man #2: All right.

151
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:54,206
- All you new guys, we're
gonna have us a little race.

152
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,931
Find out how good
you really are.

153
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:01,310
You'll to ride
to the end of the valley.

154
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,482
There you'll find
a corral full of horses.

155
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,827
You jump on one and you
ride like hell back here.

156
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,275
- Why we gotta
change horses?

157
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:11,241
- Switching mounts
when a law dog's on your tail

158
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,034
might just save your life.

159
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:17,241
- Uh-huh. Well, you gonna ride
against us, city slicker?

160
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,413
[men chuckling]

161
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,689
I mean, seeing
as how you know so much.

162
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:22,379
- Butch already has
a place with us.

163
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:23,655
He doesn't need ride.

164
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:26,482
'Less of course he wants to.

165
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:31,793
- Well... do you?

166
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,551
[Mike chuckling]

167
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,551

00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:41,103
[men whooping]

169
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll show you who's got it.
Yeah!

170
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,758
- Man #4: We have a race going!
- Man #5: Come on!

171
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:49,482
[men shouting,
horses neighing]

172
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:53,034
- Hey, dude...
good luck.

-Hyah! Hyah hyah!
Come on!

177
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:24,310
Man: You ain't
collecting this race.

178
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,827
Have a nice trip!

179
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,827
[men yelling indistinctly]

180
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,379
- Thanks for holding
my horse, cowpoke.

181
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:37,655
Good luck to you.

182
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,310
[Harry chuckles]

183
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:44,482
-Hyah!
-Get up, get up!

184
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,413
-[gunshot]
-What?

185
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,034
[Harry laughs]

186
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:17,586
[men yelling indistinctly]

187
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,172
- Congratulations.

188
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,758
That was a fine ride,
and even better shooting.

189
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,448
From a moving horse.

190
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,034
What a shot.

191
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:36,689
I'm impressed.

192
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,724
I am genuinely impressed.

193
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:41,517
I heard about
a two-gun sharpshooter

194
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:42,827
from Sundance, Wyoming,

195
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:44,482
carries a matched pair
of nickel-plated Colts,

196
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,724
just like yours.

197
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:49,034
You him?

198
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,344
- Yeah.

199
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,793
- Come on and let
me buy you a drink.

200
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,482
I'm Butch Parker from Utah.

201
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,206
- Never heard of you.
[chuckles]

202
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:13,758
Cassidy: It's not the banks,
it's railroads.

203
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:15,827
Railroads own the banks.

204
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,241
They control all the money.

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,068
They decide who gets
the loans.

206
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:27,000
They'll foreclose on anybody
who gets in their way.

207
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:33,793
Handful of evil men
who took a life out west.

208
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:38,068
Railroads, pushing our way
of life right off of this land.

209
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,241
The way I see it...

210
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:44,068
only a handful
of men can stop them.

211
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,310
[liquid pouring]

212
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,758
You.

213
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,793
Here's a toast to y'all,

214
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:55,000
the first of a new breed!

215
00:12:56,241 --> 00:12:59,482
Sons of men who inherited
wide open spaces.

216
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,275
-Men who ride free.
-Yeah.

217
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,482
The Wild Bunch!

218
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,206
[all] Wild Bunch!

219
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:06,827
[glasses clink]

220
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:08,724
- You're gonna
set things right.

221
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:10,517
- [men chuckle]
- Hey.

222
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:11,896
How we gonna do that, Mike?

223
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,758
- By hitting them
where they live.

224
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:25,724
- Morning.

225
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,620
- Morning.
- Morning.

226
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:40,206
- You ready to use those
fancy smoke wagons?

227
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,241
- Don't worry about me,
fancy britches.

228
00:13:43,965 --> 00:13:45,137
- It's not the cut
of your pants, kid,

229
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:46,482
it's what you got in them.

230
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:49,034
- What the hell
does that mean?

231
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:50,379
- Means, are you ready?

232
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:51,896
- Yeah, I'm ready.

233
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,275
How'd I get partnered with you?
I don't even like you.

234
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:55,413
- I asked for you.

235
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:56,551
- Why?

236
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,103
- Any shooting
starts in that bank

237
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,517
I want those fancy
pistolas behind me.

238
00:14:00,586 --> 00:14:01,862
- What are you supposed to do?

239
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,413
- Make sure the
shooting doesn't start.

240
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,655
Good morning, let me
help you with that, sir.

241
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,137
- Oh, my sweet Lord!

242
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,413
- Butch: Unless
you want to meet him,

243
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:15,655
I wouldn't cause any ruckus.

244
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,172
Now get behind that
counter, ya hear?

245
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,137
[metal clangs]

246
00:14:21,206 --> 00:14:24,137
[suspenseful music]

247
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:28,310
See, that wasn't
so difficult.

248
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,482
Now all we want's the
railroad company's payroll.

249
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:32,034
- I can't.
- Harry: Come on!

250
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:34,413
You don't owe that
bloodsuckers any loyalty!

251
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,517
- I mean, I can't open this.

252
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:37,413
The railroad's
money is in the safe

253
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:38,758
and I can't open the safe.

254
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:41,068
Only the bank president,
Mr. Watson, does that.

255
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,931
I'm Baton.
I'm the head clerk.

256
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,206
-The only clerk.
-[gun cocks]

257
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,344
- Well, when does
Mr. Watson get here?

258
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:50,310
- Well, he's been keeping
company with the piano teacher

259
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,000
from Bisbee.

260
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,482
Sometimes he don't get
in until...

261
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:55,000
- Out making
beautiful music, huh?

262
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,172
- What the hell
does that mean?

263
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:57,448
Let's take what we can!

264
00:14:57,517 --> 00:15:00,000
- No, we only came
from the railroad money.

265
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,379
- Damn.

266
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,862
- Wiry old boy and a black hat
with a gray duster

267
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,172
are headed this way.

268
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,620
- That'll be Mr. Watson
and Sheriff Jenkins.

269
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:10,793
- Sheriff?

270
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:13,206
- Elzy, walk
on out of here, slow.

271
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:14,344
Now, we're gonna
stroll outta here

272
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,862
like we just made a deposit,

273
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,379
and I don't wanna hear
a word different out of you

274
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:20,034
until you can't hear
our horses, you got that?

275
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:22,034
You got that?

276
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:24,206
[gun clicks]

277
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:25,275
- Trust him?

278
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:27,413
- I'm a good judge
of character.

279
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:32,344
[spurs jingling]

280
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:39,310
- Bandits!

281
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,689
- Run!

282
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,655
Bank robbers!
Outlaws!

283
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,275
- Some judge of character.

284
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:50,137
- Thief!
[gunfire]

285
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,413
[Elzy grunting]

286
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:52,517
- Elzy, come on.

287
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,034
Come on, let's go!

288
00:15:54,103 --> 00:15:55,586
- Sheriff: Hands up.

289
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,068
- Wait, they got Elzy.

290
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,310
- Get off that horse.

291
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,827
[horse whinnies]

292
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,137
- Down off your horses!

293
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,413
[gun bangs]

294
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:08,103
- Ride, come on, ride!

295
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:11,448
[dramatic music]

296
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:16,517
Posse on our tail.

297
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:18,310
- Where's the money?
- We didn't get it.

298
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,034
- Where's Elzy?
- They got him.

299
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:21,344
- We can't leave Elzy!

300
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,724
- He'll be fine
sitting in their jail.

301
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,137
You want to join him,
you go back.

302
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:26,172
Otherwise I suggest you
ride the hell out of here.

303
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:28,896
[horses whinny]

304
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:32,137
- Hey, I heard about a dude
sharpshooter from Utah.

305
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,896
You him?

306
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,655
[Harry laughs]

307
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,758
Again?

308
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:43,965
Rob the same bank?

309
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:45,275
- That's crazy.

310
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,275
- Exactly.

311
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,896
They'd never expects
us to come back

312
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,758
after the way you boys
humiliated yourselves

313
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:53,413
this morning.

314
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,931
We'll catch them
completely off guard.

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,931
- Why take the risk?

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,413
So we can get
what we went there for,

317
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:01,793
the railroad payroll.

318
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,655
We need that money
to get Elzy a lawyer.

319
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:07,034
- Some wild bunch.

320
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:09,517
Elzy wouldn't even be caught
if you hadn't turned tail.

321
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,310
- Is that true, Butch?

322
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,206
- Yeah, that's true.

323
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:15,689
We could have stayed
and shot it out,

324
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:19,379
then we'd all be
in jail or dead.

325
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:21,275
- Better dead on two feet
than shot in the back,

326
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,482
runnin' out of town like
a yellow-bellied dog.

327
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,517
- I understand how you feel.

328
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,724
Heck, I even rode with Elzy
and Mike back in Wyoming.

329
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:29,896
We'll get him out.

330
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,586
Come on, let me
buy you a drink.

331
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,620
- I feel like drinking
with no coward.

332
00:17:37,896 --> 00:17:40,206
- He's off the reins,
Simpkins.

333
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:44,137
- And you, bushwhacker,
with your two guns and all.

334
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:46,965
That belt just for keeping your
britches from falling down.

335
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,448
You're as yellow as
fancy hat over here.

336
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:51,689
- See, now, you
got everyone upset.

337
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:52,931
Two whiskeys.
You don't want one...

338
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,206
Hey, round
for the whole room... Oh!

339
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:07,482
- Should I go for the pair?

340
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:10,172
[all laughing]

341
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,655
Don't stop riding
while the sun's still out!

342
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,103
[men hooting
and laughing]

343
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:24,241
- I ever mentioned how much
I admire your shooting?

344
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,896
- Just payin' ya back
for getting my bacon

345
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:28,068
out of that fire
in town there.

346
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,586
- I'm obliged, Sundance.

347
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:35,344
- Look, Butch,
I was wondering,

348
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,137
Heh!

349
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:38,413
Well, are you
seeing anyone?

350
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,827
I mean, like, romantic, like?

351
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:43,103
- Look, I may dress a little
nicer than your average waddie,

352
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,862
and, yeah, it did just get
out of prison, but don't...

353
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:47,413

00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,206
- Shoot 'em.
- Ah!

533
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:00,724
[Sheriff grunts]

534
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,034
- Harry: See you later,
suckers!

535
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:07,344
- [train whistle blows]
- Go west, young man.

536
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,862
Old man, young woman, hell,
I don't care who you are

537
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,827
as long as you let
my trains carry you west.

538
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:14,448
What's happening
to Abilene Spur line?

539
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:15,448
The engine move out yet?

540
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:16,862
- Not yet.

541
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,103
- Well, move 'em out.
We paid for that land.

542
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,448
You get the army to wipe out
the rest of their buffalo.

543
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,896
No buffalo,
no food, they'll move.

544
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,448
And what's all this grumbling
I'm hearing about

545
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:27,241
from the Northern Pacific line?

546
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,310
- We're getting reports
of marauders in that area.

547
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:32,241
- Oh, yes,
the Wild Bunch. Ha!

548
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,448
- One of my banks in Utah

549
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,482
was pillaged by these savages.

550
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:36,655
The other stockholders
wanna know

551
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:38,310
what you're gonna
do about it, E.H.

552
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:40,862
- You tell them I'm contracted
with the world-famous

553
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:43,206
Pinkerton Detective Agency
of Chicago, Illinois

554
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:44,586
and they are,
at this very moment,

555
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,793
working at striking
at the very heart

556
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:49,206
of this outlaw band.

557
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:51,103
Their days are numbered.

558
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:53,068
[train bell ringing]

559
00:29:53,137 --> 00:29:56,275

00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,310
- Man: Over here, kid.

563
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,206
We got it, Butch.

564
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,758
- Butch: One for you.

565
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:12,137
And one for you.

566
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,965
- What the hell's
that about?

567
00:30:14,034 --> 00:30:15,344
- Public relations.

568
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:18,034
- Harry: Tell the railroad

569
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:19,344
they've been robbed
by the Wild Bunch.

570
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:21,862
[all whooping]

571
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,793

573
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:29,206
- Man: They're on our tail.
Do something, Butch!

574
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,137
- Pinkerton Agent:
Shoot 'em down!

575
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,551
- Butch: Come on, boys.
- Man: I didn't mean that!

576
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,172
- Agent: Come on, after 'em!

577
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:39,551

rich and giving to the poor!

578

- Agent #2: Come on,
outta the way, outta the way!

583
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:50,931
- Agent: Come on,
out of the way, move!

584
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,413
Put that money down!

585
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:55,448

[upbeat music
playing on Victrola]

587
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,068
- Etta's having fun.
- Cool.

588
00:31:08,137 --> 00:31:10,310
- Doesn't bother you?

589
00:31:10,379 --> 00:31:12,310
- Heh! Etta having fun?

590
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:14,310
[Butch and Etta laughing]

591
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:15,931
- With him.

592
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,482
- Now why would it?

593
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:22,068
- Things are changing, Harry.

594
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:23,793
- Not for me.

595
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:26,551
[Etta laughing]

596
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,000
- You have to try it, Harry.

597
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,103
- I'm resting.

598
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,689
- Come on, don't just sit
there like a bump on of stump.

599
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,379
Have a little fun.

600
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,586
- All right.

601
00:31:37,655 --> 00:31:39,655
- All right?
- There you go.

602
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,103
Thank you.

603
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:56,103
- Men, you're
all still boys inside.

604
00:31:58,034 --> 00:32:00,275
- At some point
we have to grow up.

605
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:03,758
[Etta laughing]

606
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:05,413

[crowd shouting]

[Etta laughs]

610
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,068
- Some do not.

[children laughing]

612
00:32:23,344 --> 00:32:25,758
[Mrs. Place snoring]

613
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,724
- Mother.

614
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:44,551
- Oh! Oh my.

615
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:49,689
Well, young Harry is a fine
looking prospect, Ethel.

616
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,586
- Oh, this is Harry
Longabaugh, my intended.

617
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:56,689
- What are you intending?

618
00:32:56,758 --> 00:33:00,275
- I'm just pleased as heck
to finally meet you, ma'am.

619
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,172
I was even riding out that

620
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,655
you might up and die before
I had a chance to meet you.

621
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,655
- And this is
Mr. Parker, Mother.

622
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,586
One of Etta's
and my good friends.

623
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,965
- Charmed, Mrs. Place.

624
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,034
- Thank you.
- Yeah, he's always charmed.

625
00:33:15,103 --> 00:33:17,586
Let's eat, I'm starved.
Come on.

626
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:22,206
- Heh!
- Thank you, girls.

627
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:24,827
Outlaws!
Oh my, outlaws.

628
00:33:24,896 --> 00:33:26,689
Well, that's all they were
talking about on the train,

629
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:28,827
The Wild Bunch.

630
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:30,517
Must be terribly frightening

631
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:33,586
knowing those men are out
there just waiting to strike.

632
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:35,482
- I do worry
about it sometimes.

633
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:37,965
- Well, there ain't
much worth stealing

634
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:39,068
around here except...

635
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:42,965
Well, except
this fine little gal.

636
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:45,206
You know, I gotta
tell you, Mama Place,

637
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,206
she's... she's really
great around the kitchen.

638
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,172
- Yes.

639
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,206
Your uncle Martin
went to Boston

640
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:54,137
to work on the new
electric trolley cars.

641
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,137
They have almost
completely replaced

642
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:58,034
the horse-drawn carriage.

643
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:00,034
- You can't replace
a good horse.

644
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:02,482
- Oh, I'd love to see that.

645
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,103
When do you plan to return?

646
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:06,310
- We're going back
at the end of the week.

647
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,586
- We?

648
00:34:07,655 --> 00:34:10,206
- Yes, Mary Margaret,
Ethel, and myself.

649
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:13,689
Well, that's why I came,
to bring my girls back.

650
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,862
- I'm not going.
- What?

651
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,551
- Well, I've decided
to stay out west.

652
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,172
- Ethel, I thought
we had discussed.

653
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,000
- I don't wanna talk
about it now, Mother.

654
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:32,000
- Mary Margaret, have you
also lost your senses?

655
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:33,793
- No, I'm going.

656
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,655
Had my fill
of the Wild West.

657
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,965
[indistinct conversation
in background]

658
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:45,000
- Harry?

659
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,517
Harry.

660
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,379
I thought you were Harry.

661
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:02,689
- I did too
for a minute there.

662
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:20,655
- It's good.

663
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm gonna sit down and eat.

664
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,000
[bell ringing]

665
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,034
- Afternoon, Etta.

666
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,275
- Where's Harry?

667
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,310
- I dunno.

668
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:48,586
- Well, I thought
you two were inseparable.

669
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:50,689
- I wanted to see you.

670
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:53,137
I wanted to talk to you alone.

671
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:54,724
- Alone?

672
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:56,206
Should I be worried,
Mr. Parker?

673
00:35:56,275 --> 00:35:58,896
- Worried's too strong
a word, Ms. Place.

674
00:35:58,965 --> 00:36:00,551
- Concerned?

675
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,827
- Why don't we
start with concern

676
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:03,655
and see if we can
work up to worry?

677
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,551
Can we walk?

678
00:36:08,103 --> 00:36:09,310
- All right.

679
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,551
You're not doing much talking.

680
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,413
- I'm thinking
of my phraseology.

681
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,793
- You've had some schooling?

682
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:27,206
- My father was a minister.

683
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:28,517
He read to us
from the Good Book

684
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,448
to where we could read
from it ourselves.

685
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:33,379
After that,
other books are easy.

686
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:36,413
- So what was it you wanted to
talk to me about, Mr. Parker?

687
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:39,103
- Well...

688
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,000
just that...

689
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,344
I have feelings for you, Etta.

690
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:48,586
- Well, I like you too.

691
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:51,413
- No, I mean,

692
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:52,758
I love you.

693
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,241
- You know I love Harry.

694
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,172
- I know.

695
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:00,896
I think you love me too.

696
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:03,517
- Well that's kind of brash.

697
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:05,068
- The other night
when we...

698
00:37:05,137 --> 00:37:08,172
when you thought
I was Harry,

699
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:10,000
I felt something.

700
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,103
I think you felt it too.

701
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,344
- What if I did?

702
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:20,862
Harry is as good
as my fiance.

703
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:23,034
He's your best friend.

704
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:24,931
- Yeah, I know that.

705
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,586
- So then what in God's name

706
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:28,896
are you hoping to accomplish
by telling me this?

707
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,896
- This here's a wild country.

708
00:37:33,965 --> 00:37:35,724
And you never know
what happens.

709
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,275
- What could happen?

710
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:44,931
- Nothing.

711
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:49,586
Anything.

712
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:52,827
[gentle music playing]

713
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:57,827
Either way, I just wanted
you to know is all.

714
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:32,551
[hooves thumping]

715
00:38:42,689 --> 00:38:44,310
- Hey.

716
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:46,172
I was waiting for you.

717
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,241
- I'll just be a minute.

718
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,206
- Man: Hey, wanna
give me a hand with this?

719
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:59,034
[men chattering]

720
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:01,965
- The railroads
are running scared.

721
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:05,034
With us grabbing their payrolls
these last five months,

722
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:07,689
the workers have stopped
working the lines.

723
00:39:07,758 --> 00:39:09,068
Production's bogged down,

724
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:10,586
and looks like
the stockholders

725
00:39:10,655 --> 00:39:12,586
are about ready to jump ship.

726
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,379
[all cheer]

727
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:16,896
- Thanks to a tip from
Durango we found out

728
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:19,551
the railroad company is sending
a huge amount of payroll

729
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,482
in order to quiet
the unrest.

730
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,448
One train with
enough cash to cover

731
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:25,551
a full year of operations.

732
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,034
[men chuckle and hoot]

733
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:29,586
- But I heard tell in town
the railroad was splitting up

734
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:31,689
their payroll into a bunch
of stagecoach shipments.

735
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:33,000
- Yeah.
- They're decoys.

736
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:34,241
Railroad's been
spreading that story

737
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,655
hoping we go after
them stagecoaches.

738
00:39:35,724 --> 00:39:36,724
- Are we?

739
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,586
- Of course not, you imbecile.

740
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:40,241
- The railroad
will think we are.

741
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,310
Instead, we're gonna hit the
train with everything we got.

742
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:45,896
- Since we ain't never
rob no train before,

743
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,620
it's gonna take
a lot of planning.

744
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:50,310
Let's get down to it.
Durango.

745
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:52,137
- All right, gather
around, boys.

746
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:53,310
[men chatting]

747
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:55,137
- Butch...

748
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:56,655
be careful.

749
00:39:56,724 --> 00:39:59,896
- Mike, careful is what
I do best, you know that.

750
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,241
- This ain't
my first game, Butch.

751
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,551
You know why
the others went bad?

752
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,827
Someone got greedy.

753
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,517
It's always the last
person you expected.

754
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,931
[men laughing]

755
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,172
- Not him.

756
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,620
- Well, money has a way
of twisting people.

757
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,758
You just keep your eyes
open, all right?

758
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:36,034
[church bell ringing]

759
00:40:44,448 --> 00:40:46,931
- Durango: Don't read it,
just send it.

760
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,724
[train whistle tooting]

761
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:06,068
[train horn blares]

762
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:08,862
[brakes squealing]

763
00:41:15,586 --> 00:41:17,310
- What's the problem?

764
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:28,137
- No problem.
Train's being robbed.

765
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:30,689
- Yeah, no problem,
train's being robbed.

766
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,241
[Harry and Elzy laugh]

767
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,724
- Come on!

768
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:37,827
[suspenseful music]

769
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:47,241
- Butch, you sure
this gonna be enough dynamite?

770
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,517
- We'll know in a minute.

771
00:41:49,586 --> 00:41:51,413
Take cover!

772
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:54,241
- [fuse hisses]
- Yeah!

773
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,379
[outlaws laughing]

774
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:58,965
[fuse hisses]

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,137
[explosion roars,
horses whinnying]

776
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,551
[outlaws hooting]

777
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,758
- Durango: All aboard,
gentlemen!

778
00:42:16,137 --> 00:42:18,931
-What the... Aah!

779
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:21,000
- Butch: Pinkertons!

780
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:23,689
It's a trap! Pinkertons!

781
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,172
- Come on, fellas!
Come on!

782
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,137
- Ride on outta here, boys!

783
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,965
- Harry: Come on,
let's get outta here!

784
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:34,068
[overlapping shouting]

785
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:38,862
- Unh!
- Get outta here!

786
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,517
Butch! Butch, come on!

787
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:43,103
- They knew
we were coming, kid.

788
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:44,586
- They knew we were coming!
- Hyah!

789
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,275
- Let's go!
- [horse whinnying]

790
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,137
- They'll never find us.

791
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:00,275
- They're headed right here.

792
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,551
They know exactly
where we are.

793
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,758
- What are you saying?

794
00:43:03,827 --> 00:43:05,586
- We have a traitor
amongst us.

795
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:07,620
A Pinkerton spy set us up.

796
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,172
- Where'd you get that?

797
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:11,137
- Found it in his saddlebag.

798
00:43:12,344 --> 00:43:13,517
- What?
- No!

799
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:15,379
- Butch, we don't
have time for this.

800
00:43:15,448 --> 00:43:16,551
Get out of the way.

801
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,034
- Mike, you known me
since I was a kid.

802
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:20,379
I say it's not Sundance,
it's gotta be somebody else.

803
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:21,586
- He's your friend.

804
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:23,103
I expect you to say
something like that.

805
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:24,689
- No, he's not smart enough.

806
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,758
He couldn't think of
a way to set us up.

807
00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:30,482
- Not him then who?

808
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:38,275
- Him.

809
00:43:38,344 --> 00:43:39,724
You set this up.

810
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:43,034
You never asked to go in
first before. Why tonight?

811
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,551
I'll tell you why.

812
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,379
'Cause he told the Pinkertons
he'd be the first man

813
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:47,655
inside the freight car.

814
00:43:52,482 --> 00:43:55,103
[Durango laughs]

815
00:43:55,172 --> 00:43:56,413
- That's it?

816
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:59,448
That's your big proof,
I went in first?

817
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:02,862
You can't believe
this crap, Mike.

818
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,034
- They didn't start shooting
until after you got in there.

819
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:06,689
- You callin' me
a liar, Elzy?

820
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:08,344
- Why were you
so brave tonight?

821
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,379
I've never known you
to lead the pack.

822
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,241
[gunfire outside]

823
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,896
Man: Pinkertons!

824
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,034
- Law dogs in the hole!

825
00:44:20,103 --> 00:44:22,137
Come on , let's go,
let's go, let's go!

826
00:44:30,103 --> 00:44:31,241
[gun cocks]

827
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,000

828
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,931
[hinges squeak]

829
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,275
- Mike! Mike!

830
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:47,724
- [grunting]
- Mike, no, no, no, no!

831
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,068
- Butch.

832
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:52,793
[Cassidy exhales]

833
00:44:52,862 --> 00:44:54,448
- Butch!
- Mike!

834
00:44:54,517 --> 00:44:55,827
- We gotta go!

835
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:57,137
- I'm not leavin' him.
- Leave him or we join him!

836
00:44:57,206 --> 00:44:58,689
Come on, come on!

837
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:19,413
- I'm gonna wire
the railhead.

838
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:21,965
Tell them they can send the
real payroll shipment through.

839
00:45:22,034 --> 00:45:24,379
- It's too risky.
They're still out there.

840
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:25,931
- I don't think so.

841
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,448
- Yeah?
Where'd you get that from?

842
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,758
Reading dime novels while
you're shining some chair

843
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,862
with your ass back
in Chicago?

844
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,103
I've been out here
living undercover,

845
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:35,793
riding with outlaws for years.

846
00:45:35,862 --> 00:45:38,482
- They must be spread
all over the country by now.

847
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,034
It'll take years to round them
up with Mike Cassidy dead.

848
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:43,724
- I know Butch.
He'll keep them together.

849
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:45,068
We better get to them first

850
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:47,620
'cause now they just
won't be looking to steal.

851
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:49,551
Gonna be looking
for vengeance, boys.

852
00:45:53,862 --> 00:45:57,655
[somber harmonica playing]

853
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,172
- So what now?

854
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,689
All the money's
in Brown's hold.

855
00:46:07,758 --> 00:46:09,413
Damn Pinkerton's
have it by now.

856
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:12,241
- We'll get more.

857
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:15,413
- How?

858
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,758
No horses, no money.

859
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:20,000
Hell, we ain't got nothing.

860
00:46:21,758 --> 00:46:22,965
- Wild Bunch is dead.

861
00:46:26,068 --> 00:46:29,000
Durango's seen to that and
the Pinkerton's have killed it.

862
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:32,620
That's good.
There's a reckoning coming,

863
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,448
and it's riding hellbent
for leather with a new gang,

864
00:46:35,517 --> 00:46:37,068
a new beginning.

865
00:46:37,137 --> 00:46:38,896
We're the Hole
in the Wall Gang now.

866
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:44,448
- All right.
What's the plan, Parker?

867
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:45,620
- Name's not Parker.

868
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:49,793
Call me Cassidy.

869
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:52,862
- Butch?

870
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:54,448
- Butch Cassidy.

871
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:01,000
We're gonna get Durango
and the railroad.

872
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:08,655
[thunder crashes]

873
00:47:12,586 --> 00:47:13,724
- Outlaws?

874
00:47:15,103 --> 00:47:17,413
- Not just any outlaws,
ma'am, the Wild Bunch.

875
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,827
- [sighs]
And Mr. Parker?

876
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:23,241
- He's the worst of the lot.
He's the ringleader.

877
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:26,172
- There it is.

878
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:34,103
- I see this is quite
a mighty powerful shock

879
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:35,862
to you, Ms. Place.

880
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:37,862
And I am truly sorry
for that.

881
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:39,620
- Shock?

882
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:42,793
You just told me the man that
I love is a wanted outlaw,

883
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:45,275
and everything
that I thought...

884
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,000
- Okay.

885
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:50,827
I've taken up
enough of your time.

886
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:54,000
Just be careful.

887
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:59,413
Oh, and let
the sheriff's office know

888
00:47:59,482 --> 00:48:01,344
if they try to contact you.

889
00:48:01,413 --> 00:48:03,034
They're desperate men now.

890
00:48:03,103 --> 00:48:04,862
- Thank you.

891
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:08,068
[thunder crashes]

892
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:20,758
- Etta, darlin'.

893
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:23,689
- Don't "darlin'" me,
you polecat!

894
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:25,827
- What are you doing here?
- Just let me explain.

895
00:48:25,896 --> 00:48:28,241
- The Pinkertons did quite
a good job explaining.

896
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:30,586
The Sundance Kid.

897
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:35,586
Why didn't you just tell
me what was going on?

898
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:37,137
- Well, I just couldn't.

899
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,034
- But you're here now.

900
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:41,517
Why?

901
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,034
- I want to take
you away with me.

902
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:45,620
- Away with you?

903
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,758
You're a robber, a killer.
You lied to me.

904
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:52,103
- And I'm...
I'm sorry I hurt you, Etta,

905
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:53,379
but I never lied to you.

906
00:48:53,448 --> 00:48:55,379
I never lied about
what kind of man I was.

907
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:56,896
I didn't try
to hide it from you.

908
00:48:56,965 --> 00:48:58,793
- Please, Harry.

909
00:48:58,862 --> 00:49:01,931
Are you even Harry anymore or
you just the Sundance Kid now?

910
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:05,896
I should've known.
I should've known.

911
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:07,310
I knew there was more money

912
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:08,620
coming in a ranch
hand could make.

913
00:49:09,862 --> 00:49:12,758
Butch.

914
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:15,172
Did you bring him
into it or did he bring you?

915
00:49:16,896 --> 00:49:19,241
No, I guess
it doesn't matter now.

916
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,310
- I know I didn't tell
you what I was doing,

917
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:23,931
but I only did it
to make money,

918
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:26,482
so that we could get
outta here,

919
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:30,724
and I can give you
the life that you wanted.

920
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:36,206
We can still have that,
but you gotta come with me.

921
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:37,620
We got to leave right now.

922
00:49:45,689 --> 00:49:46,758
- And go where?

923
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:50,206
On the run for how long?

924
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:51,275
Forever?

925
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:56,482
- As long as we're together.

926
00:49:56,551 --> 00:49:59,103
- What kind of life
would we have?

927
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:00,413
What do I tell our children

928
00:50:00,482 --> 00:50:02,862
when they wanna know
where their daddy is?

929
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:05,241
In jail? Hanged?

930
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:08,965
No.

931
00:50:13,655 --> 00:50:14,689
Leave.

932
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:18,344
- Don't do this, Etta.
- Now.

933
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,103
Go!

934
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,068
- At some point, Etta,

935
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:36,620
you're gonna have to
stop just looking at life

936
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:38,206
and start living it.

937
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:42,103
[thunder rumbles]

938
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:49,896
[door slams]

939
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:54,896
- She wouldn't go?

940
00:50:57,103 --> 00:50:59,413
- Hell, she hates me now.

941
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:03,482
- I'm sorry.

942
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,448
- Ah, I'm just trying
to make a life, you know?

943
00:51:06,517 --> 00:51:09,827
Think she'd see that ain't
easy for man like me.

944
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:13,310
- We were born too late.

945
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:15,379
A whole new century
just around the corner.

946
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,034
Frontier's almost gone.

947
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:19,551
Cities sprouting up
like weeds.

948
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,689
- I like riding for days
without seeing another soul.

949
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:24,827
Feel my Colts
around my hips.

950
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:26,551
- Barbed wires,

951
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,482
fencing in the ranges.

952
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:30,655
And now even Tombstone
won't let you wear guns

953
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:32,034
on the streets anymore.

954
00:51:32,103 --> 00:51:35,241
- Yeah?
- Railroad's beaten us.

955
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:36,482
See that glass there?

956
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,827
The bartender said, hey,
Lily, what'd you say?

957
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:42,137
- Oh, the railroad had them
make that mirror in Germany.

958
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:44,689
They sent it all the way
by boat in one piece

959
00:51:44,758 --> 00:51:46,586
all around the Cape of Good Hope

960
00:51:46,655 --> 00:51:49,241
and by railroad just
to get to this spot.

961
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,137
- See?

962
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:53,275
All courtesy of the railroad.

963
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:56,000
[thunder rumbles]

964
00:51:56,068 --> 00:51:59,068
[glass shatters]

965
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:08,241
I broke the railroad's mirror.

966
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,068
I oughta pay
with the railroad's money.

967
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,758
See, Kid... we're just
gonna have to change.

968
00:52:21,655 --> 00:52:22,931
- Well, let's change then.

969
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:26,793
Right after we rob
that train.

970
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:28,551
[thunder rumbles]

971
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:38,310
[hooves thumping]

972
00:52:46,586 --> 00:52:48,586
[horse whinnying]

973
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:50,620
- They're close.

974
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:51,827
All right, boys, be alert.

975
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:53,103
Once we get moving,
they can hit us

976
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:54,758
anywhere between here
and Utah.

977
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:56,413
Watch your target.

978
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:58,275
Don't be blowin' each
other's heads off.

979
00:52:58,344 --> 00:52:59,586
- I can't believe they're
gonna try and take us

980
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,137
when they know we're
expecting them.

981
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,896
- That's exactly
why Butch'll do it.

982
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:07,448
Conductor: All aboard!

983
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,724
- Safe locked?
- Yes, sir.

984
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:10,344
- All right,
let's bolt this door.

985
00:53:10,413 --> 00:53:11,862
- You still think
they're gonna try it?

986
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:14,586
- You bet your life on it,
which ain't worth much to me.

987
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:16,724
- Thanks.

988
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,275
- They're probably gonna
hit us just after crossing

989
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:19,793
the bridge over
to Turkey Creek Gorge.

990
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:21,413
It's the most remote
stretch on the line.

991
00:53:21,482 --> 00:53:24,379
I want you to post a rifleman
on top of every car.

992
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:26,413
They're not getting
on this train.

993
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:28,379
- Butch: Too late
for that, old buddy.

994
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,103
- Durango: How the hell
did you get in here?

995
00:53:32,172 --> 00:53:33,793
- What'd you think?

996
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:37,000
We're gonna ride down
a moving train on horseback?

997
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:39,413
That's so 19th century.

998
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:40,862
We bought tickets.

999
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:43,482
Hand over your guns.

1000
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,793
- Guns in the bag, boys.

1001
00:53:45,862 --> 00:53:47,482
- Heh!

1002
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:49,724
Well hey, hey, it Elzy Lay.

1003
00:53:50,586 --> 00:53:51,862
How you doing, sod buster?

1004
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,931
You ain't gonna get
away with this, Parker.

1005
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,413
- The name's Cassidy now.
Butch Cassidy.

1006
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:02,551
Just to show I don't forget
those who are good to me,

1007
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,172
and bad.

1008
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:06,413
- You're crazy, mister.

1009
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,413
- Now why would you
say a thing like that?

1010
00:54:12,275 --> 00:54:13,793
- Durango: You fire that
peacemaker, Butch,

1011
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:15,034
and I got a dozen
men in the next car

1012
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:16,827
just waiting to run in here.

1013
00:54:17,931 --> 00:54:19,172
- Harry: Hey, Butch.

1014
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:20,793
It's time.

1015
00:54:25,965 --> 00:54:27,379
- Now get this train moving.

1016
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:31,586
[steam hisses]

1017
00:54:33,379 --> 00:54:34,724
[bell rings]

1018
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:35,965
- I guess we'll just have
to finish our business

1019
00:54:36,034 --> 00:54:37,965
some other time, old friend.

1020
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:40,517
- I guess we will... Unh!

1021
00:54:40,586 --> 00:54:42,793
[passengers gasp]

1022
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,862
[Durango coughs]

1023
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:46,275
- Excuse me, folks.

1024
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,379
I've got some business with
the front end of this train.

1025
00:54:50,448 --> 00:54:52,931
[wheels squeal]

1026
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:07,965
- I'll be damned.

1027
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:12,034
What the hell
you standing around for?

1028
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:13,896
They're getting way,
let's go!

1029
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:15,482
Come on!

1030
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:16,482
Come on!
Give me that rifle, come on!

1031
00:55:16,551 --> 00:55:18,448
Let's go!
Get on those damn horses!

1032
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:20,241
- Man: Let 'em out,
let 'em out!

1033
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,275
-Hyah!
-Come on, move it!

1034
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:01,827
[Butch knocking]

1035
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:04,896
- Pinkertons, I'll give you
one minute to open this door

1036
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:06,827
and leave the car
before we blow it open.

1037
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,275
You don't want to get hurt

1038
00:56:08,344 --> 00:56:10,172
I suggest you come
on out of there.

1039
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,758
- You and your band of
cutthroats can go to hell.

1040
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,103
[all laughing]

1041
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:15,655
- Open it up.

1042
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:19,793
- You robbing the train?
- That's right.

1043
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:22,206
- You're the Hole in
the Wall Gang, ain't ya?

1044
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:23,931
- That's us.

1045
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,793
- Yeah, I work
for Union Pacific

1046
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,448
nigh on 10 years.

1047
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,482
Found myself
a spread in Nebraska.

1048
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:30,896
Finest dirt you ever saw.

1049
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:32,758
That damned railroad, they
come in and they took my land,

1050
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:34,689
and they run me out.

1051
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:37,103
Well, you take them damn
bastards for all they got.

1052
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:38,758
Oh, and When you finished
with the train,

1053
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:40,310
you boys are welcome for dinner.

1054
00:56:40,379 --> 00:56:43,000
- Much obliged, but I don't
think we'll be staying.

1055
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,724
You inside,

1056
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:47,206
I'm fixing open the door
and the safe with one load.

1057
00:56:47,275 --> 00:56:49,310
- I told you we
ain't coming out!

1058
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:50,931
- I know.

1059
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,896
I just want to make sure all
the single men's up front,

1060
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:54,793
so I don't make too many widows.

1061
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,482
[gang laughing]

1062
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:57,655
- [Pinkertons shouting]
- [rifle cocks]

1063
00:56:57,724 --> 00:56:59,379
- Agent: Get 'em!

1064
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:04,344
- Hold your ground!

1065
00:57:04,413 --> 00:57:06,862
- Let's get on out of here.

1066
00:57:06,931 --> 00:57:09,896
[dramatic music playing]

1067
00:57:09,965 --> 00:57:11,448
It's gonna be a big one.

1068
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:26,206
- They got a whole lot
of dynamite on that door.

1069
00:57:27,793 --> 00:57:29,551
- Durango: Hold your fire!

1070
00:57:39,103 --> 00:57:41,517
[fuse hissing]

1071
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:45,655
- Get that damned thing open!

1072
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:48,310
[door rattles]

1073
00:57:49,517 --> 00:57:52,413
[explosion booms]

1074
00:57:57,551 --> 00:58:00,482
[dramatic music]

1075
00:58:09,206 --> 00:58:10,655
- What are you
sod busters staring at?

1076
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:12,482
Ride!
We're outta here!

1077
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:14,448
- Move it out.
Hyah hyah!

1078
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:16,448
- Come on, run!
- Let's ride!

1079
00:58:41,137 --> 00:58:42,965
- They're dead!

1080
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:44,965
Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid are dead.

1081
00:58:45,034 --> 00:58:46,103
They're blowed up!

1082
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:48,586
Butch Cassidy and
the Sundance Kid are dead!

1083
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:51,896
[townsfolk chattering]

1084
00:58:57,482 --> 00:58:59,758
- Lord, they were not good men.

1085
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,310
Then again, I guess
they weren't all bad either.

1086
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:07,310
Lord, I don't know what
you're gonna do with them.

1087
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:09,137
And if you can't use them,

1088
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,379
I suppose you'll have to
give them to the devil.

1089
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:16,172
Lord have mercy on their
souls, wherever they may be.

1090
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:18,137
Amen.

1091
00:59:27,862 --> 00:59:29,448
- Can't you leave me alone?

1092
00:59:29,517 --> 00:59:32,241
I don't have enough left of
them to bury in a coffee tin.

1093
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,448
- It's a shame we never
found their bodies.

1094
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,241
I heard you lost your job
at the newspaper, Ms. Place.

1095
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:40,034
- Yes, the good people

1096
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:41,931
of Rifle, Colorado don't
wanna get their news

1097
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,448
from a confederate
of ruthless outlaws.

1098
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:46,034
So I'm moving on.

1099
00:59:46,103 --> 00:59:47,206
- Where ya headed?

1100
00:59:47,275 --> 00:59:49,103
- Anywhere but the West.

1101
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:53,275
- I'm sick of the killing
and I'm sick of its killers.

1102
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:54,724
I'm going to Philadelphia.

1103
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:56,793
I've got a family
there in civilization.

1104
01:00:01,758 --> 01:00:04,448
But I don't understand
you, Mr. Durango.

1105
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,000
They said you rode
with Harry and Butch.

1106
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:09,379
You lived with them and
yet you turned on them.

1107
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,068
- It was my job.

1108
01:00:20,655 --> 01:00:23,689
[upbeat music playing]

1109
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:32,724
[donkey braying]

1110
01:00:34,793 --> 01:00:37,793
[men speaking Spanish]

1111
01:00:39,965 --> 01:00:42,034
[children shouting]

1112
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,137
- Here ya go, Kid.

1113
01:00:47,206 --> 01:00:49,793
[upbeat music]

1114
01:01:18,586 --> 01:01:20,379
- Well, how do we look?

1115
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:21,931
- Like dead men.

1116
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,482
How does it feel
to be dead?

1117
01:01:23,551 --> 01:01:26,103
- It feels like
it's time to start living.

1118
01:01:26,172 --> 01:01:27,206
- We did it.

1119
01:01:27,275 --> 01:01:29,241
Law can't touch us here.

1120
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,517
- Apparently,
your plan perfectly,

1121
01:01:31,586 --> 01:01:33,689
except for the part where I
thought you really were dead,

1122
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:36,068
cried myself dry with grief,
and then being driven

1123
01:01:36,137 --> 01:01:38,517
from my home and my job
like a pariah.

1124
01:01:38,586 --> 01:01:40,310
Had to spend the last
month on three trains,

1125
01:01:40,379 --> 01:01:41,448
a stagecoach, and a horse,

1126
01:01:41,517 --> 01:01:44,206
so maybe I'm not ready
to appreciate it.

1127
01:01:47,206 --> 01:01:49,137
Is all this for me?

1128
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,689
- Yeah.

1129
01:01:52,758 --> 01:01:55,448
- Setting up a big
fiesta for the church.

1130
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:57,758
Whole valley raising money
for a statue of St. Lucia.

1131
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:59,655
- It's solid gold.

1132
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:02,034
- So what are you two do here?

1133
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:04,448
- We keep the banditos
in the hills away.

1134
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,724
- We're the guards.

1135
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:07,827
- Us.
- [laughs]

1136
01:02:07,896 --> 01:02:09,172
Can you believe it?

1137
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:10,758
- Ironic, you had to
travel to another country

1138
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,482
to finally go straight.

1139
01:02:12,551 --> 01:02:13,896
I am surprised, though.

1140
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:16,482
I thought you two would
be bored to tears by now.

1141
01:02:19,655 --> 01:02:20,862
- [speaks Spanish]

1142
01:02:20,931 --> 01:02:22,448
[soldier shouts in Spanish]

1143
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:24,034
- Who's this?

1144
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:26,448
- Sergeant Sanchez.

1145
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:29,448
This is the young lady
I was telling you about.

1146
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:31,586
- Senorita Place.

1147
01:02:34,068 --> 01:02:35,689
- [speaking Spanish]

1148
01:02:35,758 --> 01:02:38,206
- Ahh! [speaking Spanish]

1149
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:40,965
- When did you learn
to speak Spanish?

1150
01:02:41,034 --> 01:02:42,551
- On the train on
the way down here.

1151
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,310
- Etta's a photographer.

1152
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:48,241
- A photographer.

1153
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,068
- Si.

1154
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:52,827
- Perhaps you could
take a photograph of me

1155
01:02:52,896 --> 01:02:54,344
and my men sometime.

1156
01:02:54,413 --> 01:02:55,724
- How 'bout now?

1157
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,482
- Si.

1158
01:03:00,896 --> 01:03:05,586
[speaking Spanish]

1159
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:11,862
- Give her time.

1160
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:24,206
- Yeah, I'm really, really
happy you came down here.

1161
01:03:24,275 --> 01:03:26,206
- You didn't give me much
of a choice, did you?

1162
01:03:26,275 --> 01:03:28,448
Everything...

1163
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:30,172
everyone I love is here.

1164
01:03:32,344 --> 01:03:34,206
- I'll make it up to you.

1165
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:37,344
We can start all over.

1166
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:40,689
- Harry, I got an inch
of trail dust in my lungs.

1167
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:42,862
Will you be a dear and
get me something to drink?

1168
01:03:58,413 --> 01:04:00,172
- You're gonna make us
pay, huh?

1169
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:01,413
- Mm-hmm.

1170
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:05,689
- For what we put you through?

1171
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:09,068
I guess we deserve it.

1172
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:12,724
- That and more.

1173
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:23,206
- Mr. Sundance.
- What is it, little partner?

1174
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:25,862
- In the church!
[speaking Spanish]

1175
01:04:25,931 --> 01:04:27,344
- Pelicans?

1176
01:04:27,413 --> 01:04:29,137
- [speaking Spanish]

1177
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:32,068
All right, let's...
let's go check it out.

1178
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:33,689
I'll get those pelicans.

1179
01:04:35,862 --> 01:04:37,620
- [speaking Spanish]

1180
01:04:37,689 --> 01:04:38,793
- All right.

1181
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:41,896
I'll go see.

1182
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:43,275
Stay there.

1183
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:51,620
Alright, amigos, what's
going on in here?

1184
01:04:51,689 --> 01:04:53,482
[guns cock]

1185
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:05,172
Well, how you boys doing?

1186
01:05:06,655 --> 01:05:08,000
[priest yelling in Spanish]

1187
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:09,275
- [bandit yells in Spanish]
- Ahh!

1188
01:05:09,344 --> 01:05:10,862
[gunshot and flashbulb snaps]

1189
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:12,241

[soldiers yelling]

1191
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,241

- [speaking Spanish]

1193
01:05:25,206 --> 01:05:26,206
- What's going on?

1194
01:05:26,275 --> 01:05:28,482
- Bad men
from the hills, banditos.

1195
01:05:28,551 --> 01:05:30,310
Sundance is inside with them.

1196
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:32,413
- Boy can't keep his
nose out of trouble.

1197
01:05:32,482 --> 01:05:33,689
What?

1198
01:05:35,482 --> 01:05:37,862
Oh, all right.

1199
01:05:40,586 --> 01:05:42,655
[bandits yelling in Spanish]

1200
01:05:45,517 --> 01:05:47,620
- You boys ain't never
getting outta here now.

1201
01:05:47,689 --> 01:05:49,275
- [yelling in Spanish]

1202
01:05:49,344 --> 01:05:52,000
- Hey, what's y'all
doing in here?

1203
01:05:52,068 --> 01:05:54,137
- Well, what's the hold-up?
- Hold-up?

1204
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:55,965
No, this is more like
a foul-up.

1205
01:05:56,034 --> 01:05:57,275
These boys don't have
the first idea

1206
01:05:57,344 --> 01:05:58,413
what they're doing.

1207
01:05:58,482 --> 01:06:00,517
Not only did they
try to rob the place,

1208
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:03,689
plum in the middle of broad
daylight, with no escape plan,

1209
01:06:03,758 --> 01:06:06,241
and the whole town
setting up for a fiesta.

1210
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,206
They didn't even
cover their faces.

1211
01:06:08,275 --> 01:06:10,206
And on top of that,
they're robbing a church!

1212
01:06:10,275 --> 01:06:12,310
- Oh!
- A church?

1213
01:06:12,379 --> 01:06:14,620
Which is just about
as low as a man can go.

1214
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,482
- I gotta agree.

1215
01:06:17,551 --> 01:06:20,068
You boys are a disgrace
to the profession.

1216
01:06:20,137 --> 01:06:22,931
- Silencio! Aah!

1217
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,827
[bandits yelping]

[villagers yelling]

1219
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:34,517
- I could have handled
myself, Butch.

1220
01:06:34,586 --> 01:06:35,620
- Right.

1221
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,931
[people shouting]

1222
01:06:47,413 --> 01:06:49,482
[villagers cheering]

1223
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:51,413
- We didn't get this kind of
reception up in Vicksburg.

1224
01:06:51,482 --> 01:06:52,724
- That was Grant.

1225
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,103
- Huh?

1226
01:06:54,172 --> 01:06:55,931
- You stupid fool.
You're alive.

1227
01:06:57,448 --> 01:07:00,000
- Well, look who's
finally happy to see us.

1228
01:07:00,068 --> 01:07:01,482
- Oh, don't get a swelled head.

1229
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:04,344
I'm just glad I didn't end
up stuck out here alone.

1230
01:07:04,413 --> 01:07:06,896
- Amigos, you know
what you've done?

1231
01:07:06,965 --> 01:07:08,172
You saved the lady.

1232
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:10,655
- You saved this town!

'cause she doesn't
love you back, right?

01:19:37,862 --> 01:19:39,310
- Harry: What are they doing?

1409
01:19:39,379 --> 01:19:40,931
- They're talking.

1410
01:19:44,586 --> 01:19:46,344
He just kissed her
on the hand.

1411
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,310
- You let her go?

1412
01:19:50,379 --> 01:19:52,137
What the hell's
going on, Sanchez?

1413
01:19:55,413 --> 01:19:57,551
- Take off your clothes.
- What?

1414
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,896
- Get your clothes off.
- Etta.

1415
01:19:59,965 --> 01:20:02,068
- Just hold your tongue
and strip.

1416
01:20:02,137 --> 01:20:05,275
- So, after all this,

1417
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:07,689
you don't intend to
pay the reward, huh?

1418
01:20:07,758 --> 01:20:09,068
[Durango chuckles]

1419
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:12,034
- [speaking Spanish]

1420
01:20:12,103 --> 01:20:15,310
You have ordered me
around for the last time.

[speaking Spanish]

1422
01:20:17,206 --> 01:20:18,724

they doing?

- Fuego!
-[gunfire]

1424
01:20:20,137 --> 01:20:21,793
- Unh!

1425
01:20:24,068 --> 01:20:26,137
- What the hell you say to them?

1426
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:37,310
[Etta laughs]

1427
01:20:40,896 --> 01:20:43,137

[men grunting]

1429
01:20:59,586 --> 01:21:00,965
- Aah!

1430
01:21:20,965 --> 01:21:25,724
- El Pinkertons are no longer
with us, mis amigos.

1431
01:21:25,793 --> 01:21:29,310
But there's still the matter
of a great reward.

1432
01:21:29,379 --> 01:21:31,241
[gun cocks]

1433

1436
01:22:09,275 --> 01:22:10,758
and Sundance the kid.

[flash booms
and villagers cheer]

1438
01:22:16,827 --> 01:22:19,413

goes to Santa Lucia.

01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:21,379
[all cheering]

1440

01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,413
- Time to finish
our business, Durango.

1444
01:23:24,137 --> 01:23:26,206
- Still going on about
Mike Cassidy, huh?

1445
01:23:27,827 --> 01:23:30,172
You chose
the outlaw life, Butch.

1446
01:23:30,241 --> 01:23:33,482
You guys are gonna end up,
same as you, same as me.

1447
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:35,310
And we just don't know when.

1448
01:23:35,379 --> 01:23:37,275
- You're lucky.

1449
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,275
You know when.

1450
01:23:42,206 --> 01:23:43,827
Now.

1451
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:48,896
- You're not gonna
shoot me, Butch.

1452
01:23:48,965 --> 01:23:50,275
- Reach for it.

1453
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:54,482
- This here's Wyoming.

1454
01:23:56,034 --> 01:23:59,413
I know you swore you wouldn't
commit a crime in Wyoming.

1455
01:23:59,482 --> 01:24:01,206
You always keep
your word, Butch.

1456
01:24:02,965 --> 01:24:04,413
- You're right.

[upbeat music]

1459
01:24:35,379 --> 01:24:38,206
You can't stay
in Wyoming forever.

1460
01:24:40,206 --> 01:24:41,413
- You're right.

1461
01:24:44,517 --> 01:24:45,896
I won't.

1462
01:25:05,275 --> 01:25:07,206
- There will be time later.

1463
01:25:07,275 --> 01:25:08,517
Let's move on.

1464
01:25:10,482 --> 01:25:11,896
- Where to?

1465
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,793
- Wherever, as long
as it's not boring.

1466
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:18,275
- Is that how it's gonna be?

1467
01:25:18,344 --> 01:25:20,965
Faking your deaths and moving
on for the rest of our lives?

1468
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,344
- Been working out so far.

1469
01:25:22,413 --> 01:25:24,620
- For you, I've already been
to two of your funerals.

1470
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:27,172
- We haven't had
a decent one yet.

1471
01:25:27,241 --> 01:25:29,827
- Well, I'm in no rush
to attend your real one.

1472
01:25:29,896 --> 01:25:32,275
Not when I got
my two weddings to plan.

1473
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:35,103
- Two?
- [laughs]

1474
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:36,344
Try and keep up, boys.

1475
01:25:36,413 --> 01:25:38,344
- Etta.
- Etta, come back here.

1476
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:40,586
Etta Place, just stop
that horse right now.
