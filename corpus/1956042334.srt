a handsome stranger's been over there
staring at you for the last 10 minutes.

Uh, no.

183

Oh, come on, just talk to him,
he's cute.

184
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:54,364
I may not be gay
but I have eyes, like I'm...

185
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:55,998
He's handsome, look at him.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,533
- Look at those eyes.
- No.

187
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,403
I'll make weird squawking noises
if you don't,

188

- Okay?
- Please, not again.

190
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:08,277

This is your moment.

- Hi.
- Hello.

193
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,658
Sorry, I just realized
that I forgot to park my car.

194
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,195
Could you give me a minute?

195
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,132
Dude! Really?

196
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,568
Help yourself out right now.

- Raymond.
- Dad.

Dig in, while it's hot.

203
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:00,830
How was work, kiddo?

204
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,233
How's that pretty girl

206
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:06,136
Um, she's fine.

207

She's just so lovely.

208
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:10,007
Need to find you
a girl like that.

209
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,574
Actually,

210
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,076
there's something you guys
need to know about me.

211
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,846
I wasn't exactly planning
on telling you tonight.

212
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:19,017
It's been a bit of a day
and, uh...

213
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,085
And I'm unemployed.

214
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,487
You lost your job?

215
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:24,590
They're shutting down
our department.

Oh, Ray.

00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,490
Well, maybe this is a blessing
in disguise.

218
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:32,196
Maybe this is the push you needed
to get yourself a real job.

219
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,498
You know, like when your brother
lost that football scholarship

220
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,402
and decided to join the Marines.

something, the crazier I think I am.

I don't think you're crazy.

245
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,532
I think you're
a really good liar.

246
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:19,302
I mean you said other me
with such a straight face,

247

248
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:22,472

paperweight just like that.

Tell them to prepare
a final strike.

354

Once we find the base, we can eliminate
the last of the resistance forces.

did those geese ever do to you?

357
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,722
- That was out of line.
- Sorry.

358
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:08,058
Maybe you could do the firework
shows next Fourth of July.

359
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,025
That ought to be cool. That
will give you something to do.

Ha! That'd be
one way to pay the bills.

This is so cool. I'm like...

(CHUCKLES) I'm not sure.
But isn't it cool?

377
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:26,837
Did you just vibrate
the atoms in your body?

378
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,772
I have no idea.
But it felt super weird.

379
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,008
And I think you missed a spot.

all better. What should I do next?

from an alternate Earth.

386

couple of hours near Tulsa.

Please tell me it's not
another version of Wells.

I'm finally getting used
to the one we have.

389
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,605
Well, the latest one we have.

390
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,171
I can't tell who it is.

391
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,474
The burst disappeared
almost as soon as it arrived.

392
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:07,510
Maybe they're
masking themselves somehow?

393
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:09,978
Or you know,
they're no longer with us.

me getting superpowers?

Shh. Just say it
a little louder.

400
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,965
Okay, I don't think
the whole bar heard you.

401
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:32,504
And we're not here
to celebrate, okay?

402

- No.
- Uh, yes. Get over there.

less prone to word vomit.

Show him you can fly.

405
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,013
(CHUCKLING) That should be
a great conversation starter.

Definitely not.

doesn't build your confidence,

and recollection,

going with "The Laser."

I thought better of it.

496
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,674
What thought? I mean,
you just took your first name

497
00:31:45,676 --> 00:31:47,209
and slapped "The"
in front of it.

498
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:48,878
There's no thought in that
at all.

00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:56,104
RAY: Just for a little while.

873
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:59,073
Does this have anything to do
with what happened to your face?

874
00:53:59,075 --> 00:54:01,712
A little.
But I've got it handled.

875
00:54:03,479 --> 00:54:06,814
Well, your Mom says you've got some...
Some new friends.

876
00:54:06,816 --> 00:54:11,653
Did you get uh... Well, did you get
attacked because of these friends?

877
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:14,021
You mean, did I get
jumped because I'm gay?

878
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:15,525
Because I didn't get jumped.

879
00:54:17,793 --> 00:54:19,095
But I am gay.

880
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:30,873
Well, gay means happy, right?

881
00:54:32,675 --> 00:54:35,276
Uh, yeah. Huh. Sometimes.

882
00:54:35,278 --> 00:54:39,513
What your father's saying is, so
long as you're happy, so are we.

883
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:44,153
We're proud of you. And whoever
you wanna... You know.

884
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:47,155
You grew up right.

885
00:54:47,157 --> 00:54:49,457
You sure you don't wish
I'd grown up to be Michael?

886
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:52,725
MRS. TERRILL: <i>Don't be silly.
Michael was an exceptional person.</i>

887
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:54,595
But so are you.

888
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:58,200
We've never wanted you to be
anyone other than our Ray.

889
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:02,572

890
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:05,876
I love you guys.

- Whoa, dude.

What happened to your face.

893
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:17,452
Nazi super girl.

894
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:19,086
Come again?

895
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:20,454
Short version is I don't
have a lot of time.

896
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:22,055
I got my powers
from another Ray

897
00:55:22,057 --> 00:55:23,858
from another Earth where
the Nazis have taken over.

898
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,994
Okay. I get it.
Very funny. Barry!

899
00:55:26,996 --> 00:55:30,097
Cisco, I'm serious. I need to
find a way to get to Nazi Earth.

900
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:32,066
And I heard
that's your jam.

901
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:35,602
So, you want me to send you
to an Earth overrun by Nazis

902
00:55:35,604 --> 00:55:37,439
including a Nazi Supergirl?

903
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:38,942
Uh, yeah.

904
00:55:41,945 --> 00:55:45,912
My life is so weird sometimes.

Earth is as serious as you say,</i>

906
00:55:48,818 --> 00:55:51,119
<i>you shouldn't be heading
over there without backup.</i>

907
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:53,488
I can't let anyone else get
hurt because of me, Cisco.

908
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,856
Does that include Barry killing me when
he finds out I let you do this alone?

909
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:59,861
- You don't have to tell him.
- Fair point.

910
00:55:59,863 --> 00:56:01,997
I have to say it.
It might sound weird.

911
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:04,664
But I can't believe
I'm missing out on Nazi Earth.

912
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:08,202
Cisco, you're seriously the only
person who wants to visit Nazi Earth.

913
00:56:08,204 --> 00:56:10,336
Yeah. That's probably true.

914
00:56:10,338 --> 00:56:12,707
All right. Your power's left you
with a vibrational reminiscence

915
00:56:12,709 --> 00:56:14,209
of your doppelganger
from Nazi Earth.

916
00:56:14,211 --> 00:56:16,276
Which I was able to use
to attenuate the breach

917
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:19,113
so you end up in the right
world in the multiverse.

918
00:56:19,115 --> 00:56:21,015
Yeah, I didn't understand
any of that.

919
00:56:21,017 --> 00:56:22,416
I think I'm sending you
to the right Earth.

920
00:56:22,418 --> 00:56:25,055
But you'll still be
in Central City.

What's your plan
when you get there?

922
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:32,394
Find other members
of the Resistance

00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:34,128
before I get killed
by super Nazis.

924
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,329
Good plan.

925
00:56:35,331 --> 00:56:36,731
I got a look
at their secret base earlier.

926
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:37,898
I think
I can find it.

927
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,033
Here's hoping.

928
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:41,269
- Be careful, Ray.
- I will.

929
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:44,604
If you see my doppelganger,
tell him he's awesome.

930

Yeah. About that.
I need to talk to you both.

937
00:58:40,023 --> 00:58:42,856
I can't believe
Ray died on your Earth.

I'm sorry
I couldn't save him.

We have other problems if Overgirl
has Tornado's neural cortex.

940
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:49,196
The New Reichsmen
know where we are.

941
00:58:49,198 --> 00:58:51,198
If they did they would have
moved on us already.

942
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,767
They're probably just
marching in their forces.

943
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:55,035
They know this is their chance

944
00:58:55,037 --> 00:58:56,803
to wipe out
the entire resistance.

945
00:58:56,805 --> 00:58:58,905
I came here to help.

946
00:58:58,907 --> 00:59:01,774
I think you've helped enough by letting
Overgirl obtain Tornado's cortex.

947
00:59:01,776 --> 00:59:05,745
I'm sorry. I messed up. But your
friend gave me these powers,

948
00:59:05,747 --> 00:59:07,050
and I wanna make things right.

Okay then.
What are we gonna do?

951
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,957
- We need to abandon the base.
- And go where?

If we split up
they can't kill us all.

953
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:21,394
Splitting up would mean
the end of the Resistance.

So would the New Reichsmen
attacking us here.

I'd say they'd say
they wanted us to live.

1044
01:09:11,053 --> 01:09:12,485
The Reichsmen
may have been finished.

1045
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:14,520
But the Reich is
as powerful as ever.

1046
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:16,423
This location
is no longer secure.

1047
01:09:16,425 --> 01:09:18,925
- We have to leave.
- That's my fault.

1048
01:09:18,927 --> 01:09:20,894
Your Ray told me to
destroy the cortex

1049
01:09:20,896 --> 01:09:22,596
so the Riechsmen
wouldn't get it.

1050
01:09:22,598 --> 01:09:24,297
I didn't try hard enough.

1051
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:26,099
I wasn't ready to be a hero.

1052
01:09:26,101 --> 01:09:27,534
No one ever is.

1053
01:09:27,536 --> 01:09:28,901
But you're one, now.

1054
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:31,471
Our Ray would be proud of you.

1055
01:09:31,473 --> 01:09:33,440
Yeah, and he'd be
a little grossed out

1056
01:09:33,442 --> 01:09:34,941
by the sentimentality.

1057
01:09:34,943 --> 01:09:36,709
You ready for me
to vibe you back to your Earth?

1058
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:38,611
- No.
- What?

1059
01:09:38,613 --> 01:09:40,047
Like I said,

1060
01:09:40,049 --> 01:09:42,149
it's my fault,
you're compromised.

1061
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:43,516
And even if it wasn't,

1062
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:45,584
it's like I told Nazi Supergirl.

1063
01:09:45,586 --> 01:09:46,852
I'm needed here

1064
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,588
more than I'm needed back home.

1065
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:49,955
Cool.

1066
01:09:49,957 --> 01:09:52,126
Besides, it's like
it's meant to be.

1067
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:54,560
Back on my Earth,
we all work together.

1068
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,497
- As freedom fighters?
- No,

1069
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:57,800
but heroes.

1070
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:01,301
Well, government employees.

1071
01:10:01,303 --> 01:10:04,003
But still, we help people.

1072
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:07,776
Actually, I think my John's
kinda got a crush on you.

1073
01:10:09,077 --> 01:10:11,377
Yeah, I think there are
a few differences

1074
01:10:11,379 --> 01:10:12,581
between our Earths.

1075
01:10:13,281 --> 01:10:15,016
I like dudes, dude!

1076
01:10:19,254 --> 01:10:22,823
Interrogation report from the
Reichsmen we captured, ma'am.

1077
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:24,591
We have a location
for the chancellor.

1078
01:10:24,593 --> 01:10:26,694
- Who's that?
- Leader of the Reich.

1079
01:10:26,696 --> 01:10:28,462
Not for long, he's not.

1080
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:29,665
It's go time.

1081
01:10:36,662 --> 01:10:41,173
