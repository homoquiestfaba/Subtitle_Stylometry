1
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,633
All right, let's talk
about the big news around
the world of baseball,

2
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,600
- and that is Will Ferrell.
- We want to turn now to
comedian Will Ferrell.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,533
- Will Ferrell.
- Will Ferrell is actually
gonna suit up

4
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,533
and play
for 10 different teams.

5
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,066
- For how many
different teams?
- Is it 10 teams?

6
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:33,667
Ferrell plans
to play 10 positions
while making appearances

7
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,734
at five Arizona
spring training games.

8
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,667
And he's doing it all
to raise awareness

9
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,767
for a terrific charity
called Cancer for College.

10
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,433
And he was also
honoring Campy,

11
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,200
a man named Bert Campaneris
who 50 years ago

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,800
played all nine positions
in one game.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,700
Everything I'm setting out
to do is to establish a legacy

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,100
over the course
of one day.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,467
We are going to be playing
in five different games,

16
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,533
five different stadiums,

17
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,600
10 different teams.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
( bat cracks )

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,700
Is it gonna be easy?
Yes.

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,433
It's about playing
the game you love,

21
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,867
playing it with
intensity and honor

22
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,900
and crushing ass.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,233
And by crushing ass
it means

24
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,900
getting with the ladies.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,100
( music playing )

26
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:35,033
Here's what's crazy
about this thing I'm about
to embark on.

27
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:38,467
- Right.
- Is that we're able
to tie in

28
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,967
our love for the charity
with baseball

29
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,967
which has been a part
of your life from--

30
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,266
- As far as I can remember.
- Yeah, exactly.

31
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,900
- My dream was to be
out on that field.
- Right.

32
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,133
And that, you know,
cancer changed that for me

33
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,667
and changed the idea
of wanting to give back
to a cancer community.

34
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:58,033
- And now we're kind of
doing that through baseball.
- Yes.

35
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,133
It's pretty cool.

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,800
We've awarded a little over
$2 million in scholarships

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,700
to a little over 1,000 kids
over the past 22 years.

38
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,367
Without Will's participation
in Cancer for College,

39
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,967
we would probably have
only given out

40
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:18,567
maybe a few
hundred scholarships
versus several thousand.

41
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,100
I was diagnosed
with leukemia

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,300
when I was six years old.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,567
Jose Guevara:
My diagnosis was ALL--

44
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,300
acute lymphoblastic
leukemia.

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,000
I was 28 years old
when I was diagnosed
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,066
Cancer for College
has not only provided me

47
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,867
with a chance to go
to school financially,

48
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:39,400
but it creates
that support system
that's so valuable.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,467
It's not giving you something
because you had cancer,

50
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:44,033
it's giving you something
because you have a future

51
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,000
in whatever
you want to do.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,333
Pechera:
When I was selected
to receive a scholarship,

53
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,433
I felt like I had
a future again.

54
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,700
What I'm about to do,
obviously this was something

55
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,066
you would have loved
to have done, right?

56
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,066
Absolutely, I would
have loved to have been
playing on a field.

57
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,166
So you're gonna be living
vicariously through me.

58
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,667
Absolutely, yeah.

59
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,900
What do you--
you think I can do it?

60
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm a little worried.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,166
No, actually,
I'm a lot worried.

62
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:21,967
Ferrell:
This is such a special thing
that we're taking on here.

63
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:25,400
We're bringing attention to
the charity Cancer for College.

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,867
We're raising awareness
about the disease

65
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,133
as well as raising money
for college scholarships
for these kids.

66
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,567
But there's another kind
of cancer out there.

67
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,433
And it's the cancer
of doubt.

68
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:38,266
The doubt in my abilities
as a baseball player.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,133
I don't know if
Will Ferrell has any kind
of athletic background.

70
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:48,700
He's listed as 115 pounds.
He hasn't been 115 pounds
since, what, third grade?

71
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,133
Mike Russell:
He's a below average runner.

72
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,800
Below average fielder.
Below average hitter.

73
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Sportscaster:
Do you think he's a prospect?
He's 47. He's a little old.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,800
Sportscaster #2:
No, he's not a prospect.

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,800
We expect him to play
major league caliber defense.

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,533
Man:
Some guys are out here
trying to win jobs,

77
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,433
trying to get ready
for opening day and win
the World Series.

78
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,100
John Madden:
That's a lack of respect

79
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,934
and a respect
for what players

80
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,934
have to do to get
where they are.

81
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,767
We're talking about
top-notch athletes.
He's an actor.

82
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,400
The ball's in his court
right now.

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,900
He's gotta show us
what he can do.

84
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,967
( knocking on door )

85
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,200
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,500
- Good morning.
- Yeah, good morning.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,200
- Let's walk in.
- Yeah, come on in.

88
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,900
So...

89
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,934
big day today.

90
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,967
Here we are.
We're about to embark

91
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:48,767
on this journey that's been
months and years in the making.

92
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,734
No one thought
we could do it.

93
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,633
Follow me here.

94
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:55,800
You know, baseball,
it's really one of the great
family games,

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,567
and to have everyone
together to experience
this day is pretty great.

96
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,333
I don't know
who's more excited,
myself or my family.

97
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,166
Hey, guys.

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,066
You excited?

99
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,867
Excited for Dad?

100
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:13,233
He's about to
break a 50-year-old
marketing record

101
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,333
that's already been
broken three times.

102
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,934
- What?
What did you say?
- Yeah.

103
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,033
I'm about
to break a 50-year-old
marketing record

104
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,700
that's been broken
three times by three
other players.

105
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,900
- ( groans )
- Yeah.

106
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,200
Ferrell:
A lot of energy
in this room.

107
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,066
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the support.

108
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,033
I'm gonna need it
all day long, okay?

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,700
If that's any indication
what today's gonna be like,

110
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,367
we're up for
an amazing day.

111
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,900
All right, it's that time.

112
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,033
I'm just gonna load up here.

113
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:45,767
Grab all my gear.

114
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,233
Look, I have no illusion about
the fact that I am a rookie

115
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,533
in the strongest
sense of the word.

116
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:56,100
Can't believe this
is finally happening,
you know?

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,967
I'm a 47-year-old baby.

118
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,800
All right.

119
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,934
( tires squeal )

120
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:11,533
Yeah, it's gonna be fun
to finally get my locker,

121
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,667
put my stuff away,
get to know the guys
a little bit.

122
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,767
Get to some of that
traditional clubhouse
grab-ass.

123
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,033
This is what I was put
on planet Earth to do--

124
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,500
to play major league
baseball.

125
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:34,033
( exhales )

126
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:46,900
Quick question.
Are we 100% on for today?

127
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,600
Uh, no,
we're definitely on.

128
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,900
- Oh.
- 100%.

129
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,500
Okay.

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,166
I was just
double-checking.

131
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,767
I just...

132
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:57,900
had a little moment
of self-doubt there

133
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,367
where it dawned on me
what truly is about to happen.

134
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,834
So...
( chuckles )

135
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:06,567
but no turning
back, right?

136
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:11,867
- Morning.
- I'm in beast mode right now.
I can't talk.

137
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:17,700
Hey, how's it going?

138
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,567
Is there a good place
I could change?

139
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,333
Do you know?

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,433
You guys ready
for today, huh?

141
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,266
Ferrell:
When I walk
into a clubhouse,

142
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:35,500
I walk into that clubhouse
with two big satchels

143
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,200
filled with honey
and vinegar.

144
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,667
Some players may get
down on themselves too much

145
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,633
and I'll give them
some honey.

146
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll take
Sean's locker, right?
He's not gonna care.

147
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,800
- You got it.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,066
Ferrell:
Other players may be,
you know,

150
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,934
a little too cocky
and they need vinegar.

151
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,000
You work out a lot?

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,467
A coming-together moment--
I will make a very delicious

153
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,500
honey vinaigrette.

154
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,700
Not too heavy,
just light enough.

155
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,200
It's called salad dressing.
You want to dress the salad.

156
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
You don't want to--
it's not called
salad drenching.

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,066
What's your body fat
percentage?

158
00:09:09,066 --> 00:09:10,900
- 9%. What's yours?
- Nine?

159
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,333
Yeah.

160
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,767
- I'm right around nine.
- Right around nine?

161
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,200
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, I think you are.

162
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,767
- What's your bench?
- Bench?

163
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,100
- Yeah.
- Uh...

164
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,734
- you mean recently?
- Yeah.

165
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:24,266
Did about one,
one and a quarter.

166
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:25,567
- One and a quarter?
- Yeah.

167
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:26,834
Yeah, we'll see
where you're at.

168
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,533
Anyway, I'm just
gonna get my uniform

169
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,600
- just like you guys do.
- Yeah, you should.

170
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,233
- It's so not a big deal.
- Yeah, not a big deal at all.

171
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,667
( crowd chatter )

172
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:44,900
When we think of baseball,
there's all this hoopla
about the home run.

173
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,867
- Should I get in there?
- You should get in there
right now.

174
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,934
Okay.

175
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:55,166
But the most exciting play
in baseball

176
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,633
is the sacrifice bunt.

177
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:06,100
Just taking that
36-ounce piece of lumber

178
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,967
and delicately
holding it

179
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,600
between your thumb
and forefinger

180
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,967
and just absorbing
the impact of the ball

181
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:18,533
with that piece of wood
and just plink,

182
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,433
and letting it drop
straight down at your feet.

183
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,200
Runner in scoring position.

184
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,633
And then next batter
strikes out, end of inning.

185
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,367
But that in itself

186
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,033
is a symbol
of America's greatness.

187
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,333
The passive bunt.

188
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,266
Reporter:
Good job.
How'd you feel?

189
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,400
How do you think I feel?

190
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,266
I feel like
a million bucks.

191
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,667
Ferrell:
Bert, let me ask you this.

192
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,300
There's a lot
of doubters out there

193
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,533
whether I can do this or not.
Do you think I can do this?

194
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
Why not?

195
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,600
Could you give me
some tips in Spanish?

196
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,767
( speaking Spanish )

197
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:12,367
Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,333
And it's tough to get
reservations there
on a weekend, yeah.

199
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,667
Yeah.

200
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:25,467
Announcer:
Good afternoon, everybody,
from Mesa, Arizona.

201
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,900
We're at Hohokam Stadium.

202
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,533
And today a little bit
different.

203
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,734
Will Ferrell's
on the scene.

204
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,767
( cheering )

205
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,467
Ferrell:
People who know me,
I'm pretty mild-mannered

206
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:37,700
in my day-to-day life.

207
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,367
But that all changes
when I step onto the field.

208
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,533
We're in the show.

209
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,567
I'm technically
in the show right now.

210
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,266
Semien:
Any guy in the middle
of the diamond

211
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:48,934
is key out there
on defense.

212
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,767
Shortstop, you get
a lot of action.

213
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,967
You get a chance
to move around a lot.

214
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,133
It's like the anchor
of the defense.

215
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,600
Announcer:
Austin Jackson climbing
inside the batter's box.

216
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,433
Hey, guys, where do you guys
put your wallets?

217
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:07,967
Oh.

218
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,900
Announcer:
Kazmir, a big leg kick
and the first pitch

219
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,433
of the ball game today
comes home and it runs
in there for a strike.

220
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh! I like that a lot.

221
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,700
I like to talk in my glove
like this a lot, too.

222
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,033
Okay? Yeah?

223
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,333
Ferrell:
So I'm playing
your position today.

224
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,266
Shortstop.
I don't know if
you got the word.

225
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,300
- I did hear that.
- Okay.

226
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,667
You know, it goes
without saying I'm not
a professional ballplayer.

227
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,800
Scott.

228
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,934
- Semien: Yeah.
- Ferrell: But I could
catch fire today.

229
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,066
And you could be on
a bus back to Toledo.

230
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,700
- Toledo?
- Modesto?

231
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,700
- I think it would
be Nashville.
- Nashville.

232
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,533
So, I mean, how--
how do you feel--

233
00:12:45,533 --> 00:12:47,633
do you resent me
right now in a way?

234
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,066
Announcer:
Montero, big rip
and a miss.

235
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,500
And the first out
of the ball game.

236
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,667
Ferrell:
That's a sweet one
right there.

237
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,700
What if I turn an unassisted
triple play today?

238
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,000
Break that down.
How would that work?

239
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:03,900
Announcer:
One out and one on.
The 0-1 pitch.

240
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,633
Swing and a high chopper
to third.

241
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,533
Lawrie gloves it.
Fair ball throw down
to second base.

242
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,200
It's picked there
by Parrino,

243
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
who wants
to throw to first base,
holds on to it.

244
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,467
Will Ferrell is praising
the heavens right now

245
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,500
that he wasn't involved.

246
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,600
That's a hell of a play.

247
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,467
That's a hell
of a play.

248
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,133
- That's not me.
- Lawrie: No, I got that.

249
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,667
That was not--
but over here, too.

250
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,100
- Yeah, you look
great, though.
- Yeah.

251
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,934
You stay--
hey, keep doing that.

252
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:30,000
Announcer:
A pause, the wind,
and the pitch.

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,667
Bloomquist swings
and misses.

254
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:33,533
He's down
on three pitches.

255
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:35,333
And that'll do it
for the Mariners.

256
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,300
- Nice work.
- Will Ferrell survives.

257
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,233
Did not have a ball
hit his way

258
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:42,800
and he's getting plenty
of high fives as he races
back to the dugout.

259
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Great support
all the way around, guys.

260
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,667
Ferrell:
One thing a lot of people
don't know about me

261
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:48,100
is I love to high-five.

262
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,166
Any excuse I have
to put that arm up

263
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,200
and start that momentum...

264
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,800
I mean, I just love
everything from the thought,

265
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,367
from the inception
of the thought.

266
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,000
"Hey, we're about
to high-five."

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,166
Or "I'm gonna force
this person to high-five me."

268
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,633
The satisfying contact
of two palms

269
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,200
saying hello
to each other.

270
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,967
I missed you.
Again.

271
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,734
Again. No, look.
Look at me.

272
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:24,266
Look. Look at each
other's elbow.

273
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,533
There you go.
You didn't know
about that, right?

274
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, let's carry this
all the way to October.

275
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,867
Nice job, nice job.

276
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,533
What? Oh.

277
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,967
Yeah, sure.
I'm happy to
talk to him.

278
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:38,567
Yeah.

279
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:42,000
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,600
- Hey, Billy Beane.
Yeah, thank you.
- Nice to see you.

281
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,400
- You look great out there.
- This has gotta be good news.

282
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,033
I don't think
there is a person
on planet Earth

283
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:51,967
that I hate more
than Billy Beane.

284
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,400
Before you say a word,

285
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,567
I just want to say
we've become a family.

286
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,333
And these guys have
accepted me with open arms

287
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,133
and it feels really good
to be here,

288
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,967
so I appreciate
your support.

289
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,233
Yeah.

290
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,600
He is a bloodsucking liar

291
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,367
who hides in his ivory tower
in Oakland Memorial Coliseum

292
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,734
telling everyone
who comes into his office,

293
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,633
"Hey, do you want
to watch 'Moneyball'?

294
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:17,100
This is a story about me."

295
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,233
Here's the bad news.

296
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,200
We just traded you
to the Mariners.

297
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,633
Hey, it's part of the game.

298
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,233
Ferrell:
You know, I'll always
take the high road.

299
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,567
And that's just the way
I live my life.

300
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,367
And I've always
lived my life that way.

301
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:35,567
But he is a first-class
asshole

302
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,500
and I'm not the only one
who feels that way.

303
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Hey, let's
be professional
about this, Will.

304
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,934
I was being
professional, okay?
The whole time.

305
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,967
Blood, sweat, and tears
I gave you guys

306
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,800
for over four hours,
all right?

307
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,066
And now this is--
I mean, I know it's
a business,

308
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:52,233
but at least--

309
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:54,367
okay, where do I go?

310
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,333
Bye, guys.

311
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,967
- Enjoyed it.
- Sorry, it's a business.
This happens.

312
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,900
- Good luck.
- All the best to you.

313
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,734
- All the best
to you in your career.
- Good luck to you, man.

314
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,934
You guys will
always be family
to me, all right?

315
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,433
Hey, I'll never forget
where I came from, okay?

316
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,166
- That's right. Go get 'em.
- Good luck to you.

317
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,200
Thanks, Ricky.
Thanks, Rick.

318
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,500
You know, Billy Beane,
he's all about numbers
and crap.

319
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,433
He doesn't know
about heart.

320
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,200
- You know?
- Great job.

321
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,500
- Sorry, guys.
- Great job.

322
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,467
I feel like
I let you down.

323
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,533
Ferrell:
There's no number to quantify
the size of your heart

324
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,734
and your will
to succeed.

325
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,400
And that's what he needs
to understand.

326
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,166
I hope he has
a horrible Christmas.

327
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:37,200
Just for that reason,
you know?

328
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,800
'Cause he's my Grinch.

329
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,767
He'll always
be my Grinch.

330
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,467
( applause, cheering )

331
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,633
I'm gonna miss you guys.
I'm gonna miss you guys.

332
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,567
Man:
Finally on a real team.

333
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,300
- Appreciate it. All right.
- Welcome to the Mariners.

335
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,734
Man #2:
Come to the dark side, Will.

336
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,934
I'm playing
for Seattle now, okay?

337
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,233
- ( cheering )
- And we love it!

338
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,667
Announcer:
So after playing an inning
at shortstop for the A's,

339
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,233
he gets traded
to the Mariners

340
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,200
and he takes
Robbie Canó's position.

341
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,100
Announcer #2:
He's got to tuck that
shirttail in a little bit.

342
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,166
Announcer #3:
Yeah, the shirttail's
dragging pretty good.

343
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,066
You know what?
I don't even remember what it
was like to play for the A's.

344
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:27,700
¿Por que, man?
¿Por que?

345
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,867
Por que no.

346
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,533
- Por que sí.
- Por que sí.

347
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,300
You know, I have
a very interesting
and complicated relationship

348
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,734
with Latin players.

349
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,367
I was almost born
in the Dominican Republic.

350
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:38,900
Player:
Buen trabajo.

351
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,700
Trabajo.

352
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,367
Mucho trabajo.

353
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,867
Ferrell: My mother
was in labor during
a transcontinental flight.

354
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,900
We almost had
to touch down in the DR.

355
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,600
Instead, she said,
"I think I can hold it."

356
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,767
And we went all the way
to California.

357
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,533
Announcer:
Swing and a grounder
left side.

358
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,467
Backhand play by Marte.
Long throw.

359
00:17:56,467 --> 00:18:00,100
Takes a skip.
Takes Montero off the bag,
but how about this?

360
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,834
Jesús Montero, he picks it
and applies the tag.

361
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,900
And that'll do it
for the bottom of the second.

362
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,633
What a play.
What a play, guys.

363
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,567
- Way to go.
- I got bad news for you.

364
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,700
- What?
- I thought you
played great.

365
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,233
- Yeah.
- Jack said you just
got released.

366
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:17,266
- Are you kidding me?
- Good luck, man.

367
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,333
Okay?
Sorry about that.

368
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,533
Thanks, guys.

369
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,133
Ferrell:
It's a little bit
of a whirlwind.

370
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,900
I knew getting traded
or getting cut would be
a possibility,

371
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,467
but back-to-back teams
right out of the gate?

372
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,166
Never.
Never in a million years.

373
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,967
I just started
to settle in.

374
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,400
The guys on Oakland
are a great group of guys.

375
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,934
We were already planning
to take team trips together.

376
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,767
We were gonna go
to the Grand Canyon

377
00:18:38,767 --> 00:18:41,100
during the next off week.

378
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,667
Possibly go do
some spa stuff in Sedona.

379
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,100
Then I get to Seattle
and we start talking
about coffeehouses

380
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,000
and Pearl Jam
and stuff like that.
You know, really mixing in.

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
And then they're like,
"Sorry, you're gone," too.

382
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,133
It's brutal.

383
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,433
Even though
they gave me some gum.

384
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,700
Ferrell:
The ups and downs,
the stress of the game,

385
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,033
you got to have
a thick skin
to do this.

386
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:23,433
And I don't know
if I do.

387
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,867
Once I get out, though,
back on the open road,

388
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,567
I take a look
at the scenery,

389
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,567
the beautiful vistas,
the rock formations,

390
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:35,000
I just see people
enjoying desert living,

391
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,133
and that's my center.

392
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:40,533
The desert cactus rose
blooming.

393
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:44,166
The hummingbird lightly
dancing on its petals.

394
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,667
The smell of sage

395
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,400
and wild chaparral.

396
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:54,033
Did a lot a sketches
of flora and fauna

397
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:56,133
that I'd love to show you

398
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:57,934
if we ever get a moment,
you know?

399
00:19:57,934 --> 00:20:01,667
And also at some point today
I'd like to turn you guys on

400
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,266
to some very exciting
and interesting real estate
opportunities.

401
00:20:09,734 --> 00:20:10,834
( tires screech )

402
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,734
Ferrell:
The LA Angels of Anaheim.

403
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:18,100
They are my childhood team.
I grew up in Orange County.

404
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,266
When I walk into that
locker room and see my name
above an Angels' locker

405
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:25,767
and put that uniform on,
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
feel emotional,

406
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,066
a great feeling of pride.

407
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,300
I think it's gonna feel
like coming home.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,467
Those were the first baseball
games I went to as a kid

409
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,600
with my dad
and my brother.

410
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,633
Getting there four hours
before the first pitch,

411
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:40,967
hanging out
in the parking lot,

412
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,533
negotiating with
the scalpers to get tickets

413
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,066
'cause Dad refused
to pay retail.

414
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
Other great memories.
The sights and the sounds.

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,667
Having to bring
our own snacks
into the game.

416
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,567
We weren't going to pay
those dirty concessioners
a dime of our own money.

417
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:02,433
That first exposure
to a urinal trough.

418
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:05,100
Realizing, oh,
this is the urinal.

419
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,867
We're all gonna pee
at this together.

420
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:15,333
Looking at a large adult
male penis to your left
and to your right

421
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,700
and just thinking,
"I'm in the big time."

422
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,500
But today I'm not
in the big leagues as
a nine-year-old boy

423
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,800
with a tiny,
prepubescent penis.

424
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,133
I'm out there with
a big hairy dick and balls

425
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,066
swinging wildly.

426
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:54,367
( applause )

427
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:02,066
Come on.
Let's do it.

428
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:04,767
Let's do it.
Come on, let's go.

429
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:07,333
Let's go.
Come on.

430
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:10,500
Quit dicking around.
Let's go, all right?

431
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,300
- You loose?
- I need to stretch out
a little bit more.

432
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,200
All right, listen,
you replace him.

433
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,834
( cheering )

434
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:22,567
Ferrell:
Mike Scioscia has told me

435
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:26,000
that I'm gonna be replacing
Mike Trout in center field,

436
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,133
which no one's more surprised
about that move than me.

437
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:33,800
I mean, Mike Trout, last year's
American League MVP.

438
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,066
Wow, I'm gonna be
replacing him on the roster.

439
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,800
Announcer:
The pitch.

440
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,300
Come on!

441
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,633
Announcer:
It's a two-out RBI double
for Trout.

442
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,900
What did he do last year?

443
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,934
I think he hit
.286, .287.

444
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:49,567
36 home runs.

445
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,600
117...
( mumbles ) hits

446
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,400
or, you know...
( mumbles ) stolen bases.

447
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,767
( cheering, applause )

448
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,033
So they're taking you out.

449
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,633
Yeah.

450
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:11,467
They're taking you out.

451
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,867
Can I borrow your
glove and your hat?
I forgot to...

452
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:16,233
Announcer:
We have a new Angels
center fielder.

453
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:19,533
Will Ferrell
is going to take over,

454
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,600
at least temporarily
for Mike Trout.

455
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,700
( cheering )

456
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:30,500
We need to give him
a fly ball,

457
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
see what he's got in him.

458
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,700
Announcer #2:
Wow, Will Ferrell's
not messing around, Terry.

459
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
He's looking around,
he's saluting the fans,

460
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,900
and he's looking to see
what the pitcher's doing.

461
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,600
Announcer:
Here's the 2-2.

462
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
A shot into center field.
It's gonna drop in,

463
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,734
so Will Ferrell's gonna
have to field it out there.

464
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,834
Does a good job.
Fires the ball towards second

465
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:58,000
and holds Castillo
to a single.

466
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,467
And he's getting
a standing ovation here

467
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:04,300
for making
a play out there.

468
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,166
The great thing
about maybe playing
for the Angels full time,

469
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:24,934
I mean, one of the perks
that I know for a fact

470
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:26,834
the ball players take
advantage of constantly

471
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,700
is it's a 10-minute walk

472
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,500
right across the freeway
to Disneyland.

473
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,266
And I can ride
the teacups,

474
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:39,200
Matterhorn,
Space Mountain,

475
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,133
the Electrical Parade,
fireworks show,

476
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,834
Main Street.

477
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,400
( fireworks exploding )

478
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,000
Have you been
down Main Street?

479
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,767
You know
what Walt Disney did?

480
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,633
He built it
in such a way

481
00:24:55,633 --> 00:24:58,066
that it's an optical
illusion.

482
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,600
So it looks like
it's the longest street

483
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,100
as you walk into the park,
like it takes forever.

484
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,200
But on your departure,
he built the buildings

485
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,000
so it looks shorter,
so you're not as tired
when you leave the park.

486
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,900
But let's not--
we're getting off-topic here.

487
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,934
( cheering )

488
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,133
Well, the life
of a journeyman,

489
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,300
you always keep a bag
packed by the front door

490
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,066
'cause you don't know
if you're gonna get traded
to Cleveland.

491
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,834
It's a fickle mistress,
you know?

492
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:37,300
Announcer:
Will Ferrell is coaching
third at the moment.

493
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,066
Flashing signs down there.

494
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:41,300
Announcer #2:
Flashing signs with
his hands and arms,

495
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,767
but also he's got
some signs next to him.

496
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:46,467
Ferrell:
The Chicago Cubs.

497
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,200
Let's put the hankies away.

498
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,233
Let's take our diapers off
and let's play ball.

499
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,800
Stop being cubs.
Let's be bears.

500
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,433
Not the Chicago
football Bears,

501
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,600
but the Chicago
baseball Bears.

502
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,000
♪  He had a nasty reputation
as a cruel dude ♪

503
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,133
♪ They said

to be ready to play.

00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,867
- It's no joke here.
- This place has got
kettle corn.

I have never seen a player
play on a team

Runner at first,

00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,433

into left center.

544
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:56,467

to the track.

And it's 11-1 Cincinnati.

doubters out there as to
whether I can do this.

I'm used to a lot of doubters
within the family.

Man on P.A.:
Now batting,

628
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,700
in his first major league
baseball at bat,

629
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,400
number 19,
Will Ferrell.

630
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:29,533
I think when Will goes
up there, he better get on.

631
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,867
I mean, we're trying
to get on base.

632
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,700
If he has to get hit
by a pitch,

633
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,767
then he should at least
take one in the back

634
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,166
just to help the team out.

635
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,867
All hitters need a plan
when they go up there.

636
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,166
I mean, the plate is only
17 inches wide,

637
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,800
but you got to figure out
what side you really want
to dominate off the get-go.

638

Outside, ball one.
1-0.

639

When I'm faced with
a clutch situation,

640
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,800
I live for those moments.

641
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,567
The most pressure-filled
situation,

642
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,066
I feel the most relaxed.

643
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,333
I guess what I'm trying to say
is I'm on some level

644
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:13,100
a low-level sociopath.

645
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,600
But that's what makes me
a champion.

The Giants' outfield

647
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,000
is about as shallow
as you'll see it.

648
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,567
They call it
the Little League outfield.

649
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,533
There we go,
and Machi's pitch.

650
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,500
Oh, it's outside.
Ball two. 2-0 now.

651
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,600
Back from the set,
Ferrell takes--

652
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,266
that's a strike.

653
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,734
It's 2-1.
Swing and a miss.

654
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:40,367

655

00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,066
No, a little tapper
up along first. Foul.

663
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:34,166
( laughs )

664
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,200
And Ferrell, he's hurt.

665
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
He's not used to--
that one got him pretty good.

666
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,500
A little sting
on the hand right there.

667
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:47,567
Steverson:
Coming to the end
of any player's career,

668
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,333
your swing ain't as fast
as it used to be.

669
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,867
You know, age gets to you
a little bit in this game.

670
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:03,767
Announcer:
Machi set. 7-4 Giants.
Bottom nine.

671
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:06,767
Ferrell swings and misses
at a high fastball.

672
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:09,500
And Jean Machi said,
"All right."

673
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:18,400
Man on P.A.:
Can we have your attention,
please?

674
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,133
We've just been informed
that Will Ferrell

675
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,367
has been traded
to the San Francisco Giants.

676
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,567
- What?
- ( crowd cheering )

677
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,700
Go get your gear on.
We need you now.

678
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,967
- All right.
All right.
- Let's go.

679
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,567
Announcer:
Now Will Ferrell meets

680
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,400
his new manager
Bruce Bochy.

681
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,333
- ( crowd cheering )
- Man: Yeah, way to go, Will!

682
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,567
Okay.

683
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:47,100
Announcer:
Here comes Will Ferrell,
now catching.

684
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,500
Make sure you talk
to your pitchers.

685
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,900
- I don't need--
- About the signs.

686
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,500
We have one is a fastball.

687
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,066
- Two? Breaking ball.
- Breaking ball.

688
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,900
Announcer:
Discussion with
Jean Machi right now.

689
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,934
It's good to have
the pitcher and catcher
on the same page.

690
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,066
And Jean Machi,
there's not 100% guarantee
he's making this club.

691
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:18,767
Ferrell:
Every player knows

692
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,834
your fourth or fifth game

693
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:23,800
with your eighth team
in the same day, it's tough.

694
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,200
And the aches and pains
and you're, you know, like...

695
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,767
( groaning )

696
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,433
I'm too old
for this shit.

697
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,500
Announcer:
And now they're calling
for an intentional walk.

698
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,066
Machi's thinking
I don't normally issue

699
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,567
intentional walks
with the team up by three
and nobody on.

700
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:48,100
And looks like Bruce Bochy
now is gonna take out
Will Ferrell.

701
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:52,266
See what Bochy says here.

702
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:09,700
Ferrell:
Okay, so we're racing
to the final game,

703
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,066
Dodgers-Padres,
where I need to pitch.

704
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,734
I need to play
right field.

705
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,734
The one question I do have
for all you guys

706
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,233
is where the hell's
the chopper?

707
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:18,734
Why'd we release
the chopper?

708
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:19,900
Why am I back in the van?

709
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,333
Still...

710
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:29,133
I've become accustomed
with my status in life

711
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:31,533
of travelling with
a certain level of luxury.

712
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:35,734
Just 'cause we don't want
to go $400 in the hole,

713
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:39,233
which I easily and happily
would have paid myself
out of pocket.

714
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:41,533
( tires squeal )

715
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:45,867
( cheering, applause )

716
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,834
I throw all the normal
basic pitches--

717
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:08,667
fastball, curveball,
change, slurge.

718
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,400
The action of the pitch
urges you to swing at it.

719
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,700
Thus the slurge.

720
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,967
- Ready?
- So what are we gonna...?

721
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:18,800
- We got one fastball.
- Yeah.

722
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,934
- Two curveball.
- Right.

723
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,934
- Have you heard
of a slurge?
- A slurge?

724
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:23,800
I throw a slurge.

725
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,834
Ferrell:
I throw a traditional
knuckleball.

726
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,266
I throw a European
knuckleball.

727
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,400
I throw a Catfish,
the Black Healer.

728
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
A pitch called
the Asteroid.

729
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,834
Some of my pitches are named
with whole sentences.

730
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:41,633
Like the Miraculous
Ascension of Sister Guadalupe.

731
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,133
One of my pitches
is named Barry.

732
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:48,967
I don't even consider
him a pitch.

733
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,433
He's like a close friend.

734
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,233
He's like a guy

735
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:55,867
that you could literally
not see for a year

736
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,667
and call him up
out of the blue

737
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:00,700
and meet him at
the local watering hole

738
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,600
and it's like you guys
picked up right where
you left off.

739
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:08,433
Barry is, like I said,
not a pitch.

740
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,200
He's a dear friend.

741
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,166
And...

742
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:18,300
the time I've spent
with Barry,

743
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,834
he's helped me through
some very difficult times.

744
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:24,100
And... yeah.

745
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,734
I mean, he helped me recover
from my motorcycle accident.

746
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,633
And...

747
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:42,166
I don't know what to say
more about Barry.

748
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,166
Announcer:
Rico Noel is the batter.

749
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:49,600
Announcer #2:
And he just moved up
in the box.

750
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,266
Announcer:
Bunting back to Ferrell
and there's one away.

751
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,767
( crowd booing )

752
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:10,667
Announcer:
Shades of Doug Jones

753
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:13,233
and the late Rod Beck.

754
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:15,767
And it looks like
that's gonna be all

755
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:17,500
for Will Ferrell tonight.

756
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,934
He won't even look
Donnie in the eye.

757
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:24,734
Look at this.
He doesn't want to
give up the rock.

758
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
I still made
the team, right?

759
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,567
Absolutely.

760
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:36,800
- All right.
- Good job.

761
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,700
( crowd cheering )

762
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,967
Announcer:
And that's gonna be it

763
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,600
for the Dodger career
of Will Ferrell.

764
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:48,667
I think I just
got released.

765
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:55,700
Announcers:
He's snapping.

766
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,633
I get guys out, okay?

767
00:40:59,767 --> 00:41:02,066
Majority of players
at the end of their career,

768
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,900
it can be a really tough
adjustment.

769
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,266
You never want
to think you're at the end
of your career

770
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,567
until I think
it creeps up on you

771
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,934
and you have to accept it.

772
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,567
You get into this pattern
of what you do,

773
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,633
a routine day in,
day out, and all of
a sudden it's gone.

774
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:20,000
Different guys
have different ways
that they handle it.

775
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,133
I just pray there's
one more team out there

776
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:26,767
that'll take me.

777
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,500
Anybody find my glove?

778
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:33,700
Announcer:
Will Ferrell's
ready to go out

779
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,700
and play right field
for San Diego

780
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,133
in what's
an important frame.

781
00:41:38,133 --> 00:41:40,300
We're scoreless headed
to the ninth.

782
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,800
This is the last one.
Here we go.

783
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,900
Announcer:
Will Ferrell has worn
number 19 most of the day

784
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,934
and that's because
Campy Campaneris wore
number 19 as an Oakland A.

785
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,800
So tipping his cap
to Campy

786
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,066
whose all-nine feat
he's replicating tonight.

787
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:07,567
But number 19 will never
be worn in San Diego again.

788
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,200
Announcer #2:
Retired number of the late
great Tony Gwynn,

789
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,834
the Hall of Famer.

790
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,767
This is gonna be my ball club,
the San Diego Padres.

791
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,967
I can live in San Diego.
I love La Jolla.

792
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:22,333
My God.

793
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:26,700
Can't believe I'm gonna end
my career with the Padres.

794
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:32,867
Announcer: Oh, my.
Will Ferrell can't do
anything about that one.

795
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:35,767
1-0 Los Angeles.

796
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:42,834
He got all of that.
He got all of that.

797
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,767
Announcer:
So here's Scott Van Slyke.

798
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:54,533
A little infield pop
for Diego Goris.

799
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,567
Will Ferrell's busy
Cactus League day is over.

800
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,333
You know, there's so many
components to baseball.

801
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,333
There's hitting,
fielding, pitching.

802
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:10,533
But every
ball player knows

803
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:13,033
the thing that gets you
to the show

804
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,867
and the thing that keeps
you in the show

805
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:19,033
is the ability to deliver
a great speech.

806
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:23,367
Today I consider myself

807
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,633
the luckiest man
on the face of the Earth.

808
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:29,667
Baseball really was
a great game

809
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:32,166
and baseball is really
a great game.

810
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:35,500
For all of your support
over the years,

811
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,934
I want to thank you,
the fans of Baltimore,

812
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:40,700
from the bottom
of my heart.

813
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:45,500
Announcer:
Well, Will Ferrell is getting
ready to address the crowd,

814
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,000
a crowd of over 10,000
on this Cactus League night.

815
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,133
If I can just have
everyone's attention, please.

816
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,633
I'd like to say
a few words.

817
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,834
I'd like to thank you all
for today.

818
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:05,600
( cheering )

819
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,533
You know, when I embarked
on this journey

820
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:10,300
way back at breakfast,

821
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,066
I thought to myself,
could I do it?

822
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,266
My career has not gone
according to plan.

823
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:28,100
When I first showed up
on the A's doorstep,

824
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,467
I thought I'd be an A
for life.

825
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,266
But then I was a Mariner,
an Angel,

826
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:37,767
a Cub, a Diamondback,
a Red, a White Sox,

827
00:44:37,767 --> 00:44:41,400
a Giant, a Dodger.

828
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,667
I think I'm missing one.

829
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:48,266
Was I the best player
on the field today?

830
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:50,300
( crowd cheering )

831
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,600
Maybe. Maybe?

832
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,033
Maybe? Can you--
can you chant that
with me now?

833
00:44:56,033 --> 00:45:00,533
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

834
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:04,834
( crowd chanting )
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

835
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,333
There's no doubt
I turned some heads today.

836
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:11,033
I brought passion
to the field,

837
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:13,467
dedication, ability,

838
00:45:13,467 --> 00:45:16,033
and a lot of ignorance.

839
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:19,133
There is life
in this 47-year-old arm.

840
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,767
They say nothing's more American
than grabbing a hot dog,

841
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:32,033
heading to the ball park
and watching nine guys

842
00:45:32,033 --> 00:45:35,333
from the Dominican Republic
make magic on the field.

843
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,266
But you know what?

844
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:40,266
Today I learned
they are wrong.

845
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:42,000
Make that eight Dominicans

846
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,233
and one guy
from Irvine, California.

847
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:46,500
( cheering )

848
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,467
Ruth,

849
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:58,633
Musial, Mantle,

850
00:45:58,633 --> 00:46:00,600
Will Ferrell.

851
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:16,700
On a serious or real note,
thank you all.

852
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,033
What a day.
Thank you to Major League
Baseball,

853
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:22,934
to my family, and especially
to Craig Pollard.

854
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,533
Craig is here tonight.

855
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:26,200
Craig:
Here, here.

856
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,467
Craig's right there.
There's Craig, everyone.

857
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:30,533
Big hand for Craig Pollard.

858
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:40,900
We were fired up
you got a piece
of that one.

859
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,867
- You had good swings.
- I thought, is there
a chance?

860
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,433
Is there a chance
I actually get a hit?

861
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:46,934
- But, no, he kept it
outside.
- Yeah.

862
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:51,033
When I'm at that
induction ceremony
at Cooperstown,

863
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:54,934
when Bubba Watson
puts that green jacket
on my shoulders,

864
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:56,700
I'm gonna be thankful.

865
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,467
I'm not gonna be
a dick about it.

866
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:01,166
But I'm gonna be like,
"Don't lose sight of the fact,

867
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,600
everyone,
that I earned this."

868
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,567
And at the end,
the very end,

869
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:14,033
I'm talking about
I'm at the pearly gates

870
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:17,734
and I'm at that
dream dinner of me,

871
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,467
Abraham Lincoln,
Joan of Arc, Don Shula,

872
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:22,700
you know,
and they're looking at me
and they're like,

873
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,800
"Can I just ask one question?
Were you the guy

874
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,600
who played
all nine positions
and DH'd?"

875
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,133
I'm like, "Yeah.

876
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:33,333
Yeah, I'm that guy.

877
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,667
Pass the mashed potatoes."

- All in one day.

884

All one day and...

885
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:02,400
As a little charity
fundraiser.

886
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,266
As a charity fundraiser,
which is a cool thing to do.

887
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:06,467

And I'm beginning
to think that any uniform
you look great in.

892
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,633
But you really looked
like a big leaguer.

893
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:24,033

Yeah.

898

And what's the point?

906
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,333
Listen, man.

907

I've been in this game
a long time.
