1
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,101
/Toro! Toro! Toro!

2
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,523
/Toro! Toro! Toro!

3
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:15,709
- Whose idea was this, anyway?
- They're gaining on us.

4
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,503
/Andale! Andale!

5
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:26,512
Yeah!
Yeah!

6
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,686
/Whoa!

7
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:42,736
He's after me!

8
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:49,451
Phil!

9
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,663
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

10
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,050
Jesus!

11
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:17,563
Ed!

12
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:19,231
Go, Mitch!

13
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,408
Stay, bull. Stay, bull.
Stay, bull!

14
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:34,079
Stop following me!

15
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,211
Please!

16
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:28,671
Does he know what he's doing?
Has he any idea what he's doing?

17
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:29,713
Ow.

18
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,216
Relax.
He's doing a beautiful job.

19
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:35,094
Sir. El doctor.
Hello!

20
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,974
Don't sew up anything that's
supposed to remain open, OK?

21
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,225
Si.

22
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:49,900
- What, are you taking pictures, Phil?
- Are you kiddin'? This is a Kodak moment. Now, smile.

23
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:52,778
Oh, good.
Blind him with the flash.

24
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:56,365
Phil, let the man keep
what's left of his dignity, please.

25
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:59,868
- "Dignity." This is all your fault, Ed.
- My fault?

26
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:03,831
- You're a macho lunatic. Phil & I are sheep.
- We're not sheep.

27
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:07,543
- We do every stupid thing he asks!
- I didn't make you run.

28
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:12,339
No, it was a 2,000lb rampaging animal
spraying bull snot all over Spain.

29
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,342
That's what made me run.
You made me stand in front of it.

30
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,553
Come on, guys.
Group shot.

31
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,848
I got a big "I told you so"
coming from Barbara.

32
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,933
Maybe she won't notice.

33
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,734
- Honey, want a pillow? It's a long flight.
- No, thanks.

34
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,530
Come on, it's not that bad.
I look like your mother.

35
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,868
Here comes Mr Bull.

36
00:06:41,452 --> 00:06:44,163
Kim, baby, do you want
the aisle or the window seat?

37
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:46,832
- Whatever you want makes me happy.
- I don't care.

38
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,085
Good, then take the window.
I wanna talk to Mitch.

39
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,588
- Be right back.
- Miss me.

40
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,090
Admit it, pal.
You had fun.

41
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,386
No. Scuba diving is fun.
I mean that's normal. People do that.

42
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,515
Baseball fantasy camp, until Phil
threw up on Willie Mays, was fabulous.

43
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:07,394
- I was nervous. He was my idol.
- I'll never forget Willie's face.

44
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:09,897
"Say, hey. That's lunch on me."

45
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:13,525
- Phil. I'm standing.
- Yes, dear.

46
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,780
Can't wait to get out of this country.

47
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,285
Maybe it's just me, but I think our little
adventures lately are becoming... stupid.

48
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,163
What did you call them?

49
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:28,999
- "Desperate attempt
to cling to your youth."

50
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:32,044
- That's bullshit.
- Bullshit? Ed, have you noticed...

51
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,630
...the older you get,
the younger your girlfriends get?

52
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,966
Soon, you'll be dating sperm.

53
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,594
- I'm back.
- OK. I have just one more thing to say.

54
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:44,431
- Target parachute jumping.
- Ed!

55
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,935
Now, it's a smaller parachute,
but you're travelling twice as fast.

56
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,730
Great! When they find your body,
they can bury it in a sucrets box.

57
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,608
- Phil said he'd go.
- Phil wants to die.

58
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,653
If you were married to that,
you'd wanna die too.

59
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:00,656
He's pretending to be asleep
so he doesn't have to talk to her.

60
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:03,200
It's a couple of little jumps from a plane.

61
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,538
And then what? We go on safari, only
the animals have guns and they hunt us?

62
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,666
- Forget about it.
- It's never enough for you, Ed.

63
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,836
- I'm reading.
- When's it ever gonna be enough?

64
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,270
- Hi, Mom.

65
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:34,231
/It's september 8th, 1952.

66
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:40,571
/We're driving back from
/your Aunt Marsha. My water breaks.

67
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:44,074
/Your father jumps the divider
/of the sawmill River parkway...

68
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:46,952
/... and races me to Doctors' Hospital and...

69
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,749
/... at 5.16, out you came.

70
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,460
/Ohh...

71
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,712
/Happy birthday, darling.

72
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,384
/- Here's your father.
/- Hello, boy. Happy birthday.

73
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:06,096
- Hi, Dad, how are you?
/- I'm losing feeling in my left leg.

74
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:09,099
/- Here's your mother.
/- Don't worry. He's fine.

75
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:12,102
/So, what are you gonna
/do now, birthday boy?

76
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:16,106
I thought I'd lie here another three
and a half hours, and then go to work.

77
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:19,109
/- Is Barbara with you?
- No, she's working the streets.

78
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:22,613
She has her breakfast with her pimp.
She'll be in around 7.30.

79
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,115
- Hi, Mom.
/- Give my boy a kiss.

80
00:09:28,118 --> 00:09:30,871
/I can't believe my baby's 39 years old.

81
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,126
Bye, Mom.

82
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:40,130
/Oh, bye.
/Angel, birthday boy.

83
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,010
Happy birthday.

84
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:58,273
Well, at least she said my age in years.

85
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,776
Usually she uses months,
like I'm still an infant.

86
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:04,154
"How's Mitch?"
"Oh, good. He's 468 months today."

87
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,573
Wow.

88
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:10,577
I look a year older.
Do I look a year older to you?

89
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:13,872
Honey, at 5.15,
everybody looks a year older.

90
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,002
- Do you know what I found yesterday?
- Hm?

91
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:20,004
- Hair in my ear.
- Mitch.

92
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:24,008
I'm losing hair where I want hair,
and getting one where it shouldn't be hair.

93
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:27,720
I found four big fat ones on my back.
I'm starting to look like the fly.

94
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,806
That's it. I'm cancelling
your birthday party.

95
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:34,893
- Why?
- Cos your birthdays depress you.

96
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:36,979
- No, they don't.
- Oh, Mitch.

97
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:39,982
On your 30th birthday,
you said you couldn't see.

98
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:43,402
On your 34th birthday,
you forgot my name for an hour.

99
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:46,655
Last year, when I asked you
what you wanted...

100
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,699
...you said a CAT scan.

101
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:52,661
- I had a headache.
- This year, let's just let it pass.

102
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:55,873
- I wanna see my friends.
- All right.

103
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:59,877
But I don't want people coming over here
thinking they're in a Bergman film.

104
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:02,504
"You've met my husband, Mr Death?"

105
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:05,591
- I'll be good.
- Yeah?

106
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,761
Cos I don't need you
any worse than you've been.

107
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:13,432
- Wait a second. What does that mean?
- Nothing.

108
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:15,392
"Nothing."

109
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,144
Great.

110
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:15,369
Got a minute?

111
00:12:17,663 --> 00:12:20,666
Hi. Only if a few minutes.
I have career day at Danny's school.

112
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,085
Yeah, it'll just take a second.

113
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:27,798
What is it?

114
00:12:27,798 --> 00:12:29,300
/* Pizza Guy, Pizza Guy

115
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,135
/* Come on down to Pizza Guy

116
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,636
/* Be a happy, happy fella

117
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,555
/* Have some sauce and mozzarella

118
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,765
/ * At Pizza Guy

119
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,392
- So?
- So.

120
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:41,812
So, it's stupid.
It's annoying.

121
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:46,483
- It makes people change the station.
- I didn't write it.

122
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:50,821
You bought it. You put it on the air
three times a night in a prime time.

123
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:53,115
People are having accidents.

124
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,043
You used to go out and get advertising.

125
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:06,462
You hustled.
You were creative.

126
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,547
Something bad came in, you fixed it.

127
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:11,050
You rewrote it.
You worked with it.

128
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,803
My God, we used to make fun of guys
who bought crap like this.

129
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,599
What's going on with you?

130
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:23,646
Did you ever reach a point
in your life where you think...

131
00:13:23,646 --> 00:13:27,650
..."This is the best I'm ever gonna
look, the best I'm ever gonna feel...

132
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,153
...the best I'm ever gonna do,
and it ain't that great"?

133
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,573
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

134
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,079
Look, I'm the station manager.

135
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm responsible... for the quality
of work here at the station...

136
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:49,338
...so, until further notice, I shall
personally approve all the new spots.

137
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:52,925
What? I can't make a deal
without checking with you first?

138
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,386
Just till you get back on track.

139
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,683
So we're doing this job
on 60th and 3rd...

140
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:03,268
...big friggin' ballbreaker
of a job, right?

141
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:06,397
We got the area roped off so
that some schmuck don't walk in...

142
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:09,400
...and take a wreckin' ball
between the eyes.

143
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,113
All of a sudden, this woman, with the big,
dark glasses, the Bloomingdale's bags...

144
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,157
...she starts walkin' through the ropes.

145
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:21,120
I yelled down at her "Hey, you
can't go there, you stupid bitch!"

146
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:24,957
Suddenly, this big steam fitting bursts...

147
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:29,628
...and this enormous goddamn crane
crashes right down on her legs...

148
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:33,340
...and she's screaming "My legs! My legs!"

149
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:37,678
And I say "No shit, your legs. You got
a 2,000lb goddamn crane on'em."

150
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,059
Now, do you know how, in an emergency,
you can get superhuman strength?

151
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:48,397
I reach down and I lift this crane...

152
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:51,650
...and Ernesto's able
to slide her out from under...

153
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,278
...and the doctors were
able to save her legs!

154
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:58,198
So the moral is... don't walk
where you're not supposed to walk...

155
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:02,828
...because there may not be somebody
with superhuman strength to save you.

156
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:08,375
And don't do drugs.
That's it.

157
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:17,968
Thank you, Mr Morelli.
That was... very descriptive.

158
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:24,391
Daniel, would you introduce your father,
please, and tell us what he does?

159
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:31,565
My Dad's named Mitch and he's...

160
00:15:31,607 --> 00:15:34,818
...he's a submarine commander.

161
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:36,362
Danny.

162
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:40,324
He works for WBLM radio.

163
00:15:53,587 --> 00:15:56,632
Well, like Danny said,
I work for WBLM radio.

164
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:01,470
- Are you a disc jockey?
- No, I'm not a disc jockey.

165
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,183
You know the commercials
that are on the radio?

166
00:16:06,183 --> 00:16:08,727
Do you make all those commercials?

167
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:11,480
No. Other people
make the commercials.

168
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,985
I sell them time on our station
for the commercials to be on.

169
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:19,947
So you decide which
commercials to use and when.

170
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:24,410
That's right. Well, no, it's
not right. It used to be right.

171
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,665
Seems now that I have to check with the
station manager if I wanna wipe my nose.

172
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:35,671
The minute he took away
my authority, I shoulda quit.

173
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,723
Mr Robbins?

174
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,309
What?

175
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,856
Value this time in your life, kids.

176
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:57,359
This is the time in your life
when you still have your choices.

177
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,278
It goes by so fast.

178
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:02,865
When you're a teenager, you think
you can do anything, and you do.

179
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:07,161
Your 20s are a blur. 30s, you raise
your family, you make a little money...

180
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:11,373
...and you think to yourself
"What happened to my 20s?"

181
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:15,919
40s, you grow a little pot belly, you grow
another chin. The music gets too loud.

182
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:20,424
An old girlfriend from high school
becomes a grandmother.

183
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:25,012
50s, you have a minor surgery. You'll
call it a "procedure", but it's a surgery.

184
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:29,141
60s, you'll have a major surgery.
The music is still loud...

185
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,143
...but you can't hear it anyway.

186
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:34,313
70s, you and the wife
retire to Fort Lauderdale.

187
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:38,150
You eat dinner at two in the afternoon...

188
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,153
...lunch around ten,
breakfast the night before.

189
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:45,157
You spend most of your time in malls
looking for the ultimate soft yoghurt...

190
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:48,369
...and muttering
"How come the kids don't call?"

191
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:52,915
The 80s, you'll have a major stroke. You
end up babbling to a Jamaican nurse...

192
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:56,418
...that your wife can't stand
but who you call "Momma".

193
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,128
Any questions?

194
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:03,759
Danny was embarrassed
to tell the class what my job is.

195
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,305
They're nine! They get excited about the
guy who gives them change at the arcade.

196
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:13,769
You just happen to have one
of those jobs that's difficult to...

197
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:17,773
Believe that a grown man
does without losing his mind.

198
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:22,569
Well, what is my job?
I sell advertising time on the radio.

199
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:24,947
Basically, I sell air.

200
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:29,243
At least my father was an upholsterer.
He made a sofa, coach you can sit on it.

201
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:33,580
What can I point to?
Where's my work? It's air. I sell air.

202
00:18:33,956 --> 00:18:36,750
So what are you saying?
You wanna quit?

203
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,753
How can I quit?
I'm trapped.

204
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:43,799
- You're trapped?
- Yeah. You want to send Holly...

205
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,802
...to a performing arts school.
- She's got talent.

206
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,805
Hellen, she was in one play,
and she fell off the stage.

207
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:53,309
That's not talent, that's gravity.
And that school costs money.

208
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:55,436
- Bye.
- Bye.

209
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:58,355
- Where are you going?
- I'm sleeping at Gwen's.

210
00:18:58,355 --> 00:19:00,858
Again?
Are you paying rent there?

211
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:04,486
- Dad.
- We're having a birthday party.

212
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:08,365
- I don't wanna hang out with your friends.
- I told her it'd be all right.

213
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,951
We'll have a family party tomorrow.

214
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:18,042
- Bye, Dad. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

215
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,091
Let me show you
how I pop my shoulder.

216
00:19:28,844 --> 00:19:30,804
Danny. Dan.
Come on.

217
00:19:30,846 --> 00:19:32,848
He's in the gifted programme at school.

218
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:34,850
Come on, go to sleep.

219
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:39,647
Kim, you poor thing. What has married
life done to you? You look like hell!

220
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:43,359
Six months. Admit it. You didn't
think Ed would ever get married.

221
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,361
He met the right woman.

222
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:49,823
- How often are you meeting that woman?
- You're lucky it's your birthday, pal.

223
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:52,993
Excuse me, I see one
of the guests is stealing.

224
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,040
Your husband is so cute.
You must laugh all day.

225
00:19:58,874 --> 00:20:00,834
Yeah.
My sides hurt.

226
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:04,338
We saw a picture of you
in a newspaper in your underwear.

227
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:08,300
Oh, that was an advertisement.
I sometimes model ladies' underwear.

228
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,761
- You looked great.
- Mom...

229
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:14,473
...you said "Let's see how
she looks after having two kids."

230
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,395
Daniel, time to go to bed.

231
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:21,855
We'll wake you for your wedding.

232
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,276
Phil. Psst.
Hello.

233
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:31,198
You're pretending
to sleep at my birthday party.

234
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,075
Is she around?

235
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,121
She's in the kitchen.

236
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:41,417
This is quite a life you've carved out for yourself, Phil.

237
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,627
Phil! Phil!
We're leaving.

238
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:48,799
We haven't had cake.
He hasn't even opened his presents yet.

239
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:53,053
Phil, you have to open the store
at 4.30. Daddy's counting on you.

240
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:55,472
15 more minutes?

241
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:01,437
Starting now.

242
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:11,155
4.30 in the morning?

243
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:14,742
You manage a supermarket,
that's when the food arrives.

244
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,827
Don't you have an assistant
or a kid or somethin'?

245
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,371
Arlene's father likes me to do it.

246
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:23,334
"No free rides, Philly boy.
No free rides."

247
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:26,837
I'm tellin' you, they got me by the balls.

248
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:29,381
She's got one, he's got the other.

249
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,844
Do you ever think about quitting?

250
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,721
Yeah, sure.
Right.

251
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:39,975
That's just what I wanna do.
Start over, with two kids to take care of.

252
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:43,646
No. At this age,
where you are, you are.

253
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:49,443
- Hey, look who's awake.
- Look, I have got 14 minutes...

254
00:21:49,443 --> 00:21:51,945
...so can we give him the present?
- Yeah.

255
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:53,822
What'd you get me?

256
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:59,495
Two weeks. The three of us.
New Mexico. Driving cattle.

257
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,831
- What? Like in a truck?
- No, no! Cowboys.

258
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,294
- It's a real old-fashioned cattle drive.
- We drive the herd to Colorado.

259
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:11,674
- You can do this?
- We ride, we sleep out under the stars.

260
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:15,427
- Show him the brochure.
- It's fantastic, Mitch.

261
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,098
It's the newest thing.
People do this!

262
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:20,975
Wow.
Look at this.

263
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:23,769
- Real horses!
- Does look good.

264
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,231
"Good"? It's great. Cowboys -
it's what you always wanted to be.

265
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:30,526
- Remember Mitchy the Kid?
- Right! Mitchy the Kid!

266
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:35,614
And it's right when your vacation
comes. We've been planning it for weeks.

267
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,908
I can't do it.

268
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:43,163
- Why?
- We're going Florida to visit Barbara's parents.

269
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:48,127
- What, are you sick?
- No, it's planned already. I promised.

270
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:52,756
I worked every weekend for a year
to get this. What's with you these days?

271
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,342
Nothing.
You know, nothing.

272
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:59,305
It's just, I...
I don't wanna disappoint Barbara.

273
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:05,019
Who is that? I know nine people
and they're all here. Excuse me.

274
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:11,942
- Hi.
- Um, is Mr Phil Berquist here?

275
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:15,446
Can I get you something to...

276
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:18,490
Your housekeeper told me
where you were. I'm in trouble.

277
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,493
What are you doing here?
Who's on register nine?

278
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:22,995
- I don't know what to do.
- Rumaki?

279
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:26,373
- This isn't the time to talk about this.
- I'm late.

280
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:28,876
- What?
- I missed my period.

281
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:31,712
- What?
- I was at work and on my break...

282
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:34,757
...and I took a home
pregnancy test from aisle 11.

283
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:38,052
- The ones on special?
- Yes! And it came out blue.

284
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:41,597
Why is she telling you this... Phil?

285
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,559
Because I'm... I'm her boss...

286
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,853
...and we have a health plan.

287
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:52,316
Son of a bitch! You screwed
this little girl in my father's store?

288
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,902
- No, no, no!
- It was in his car!

289
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:56,945
Oh, Jesus!

290
00:23:56,945 --> 00:23:59,490
And I'm not a little girl.
I'm 20.

291
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:02,576
Get out of this house, you little whore.

292
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:06,330
Hey! I will not permit you
to talk to her that way.

293
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:12,127
Fine.

294
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:16,966
- I'll tell my father what you did.
- No! Do not call Mr Levine.

295
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:20,886
- Hey! Put down that phone. Put it down.
- No! No!

296
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,390
- That's my phone!
- You're crazy!

297
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,810
Not having sex for 12 years
will do that to a person!

298
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:31,605
Come on, just stop it.
Come on, not in front of your friends.

299
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:33,941
I'm not afraid of you!

300
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:39,405
- I'll call from the bedroom!
- The bedroom? How would you know where that is?

301
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,783
- I'm calling!
- Go ahead. I'm sure he's home.

302
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,786
It's his night to meet with
the other escaped Nazis.

303
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:48,288
- I hate you!
- I hate you more.

304
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,834
If hate were people, I'd be China.

305
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:01,885
Let's bring out the cake.

306
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,935
Good party.

307
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:13,564
Mitch.

308
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:18,193
Is that what you've been trying
to tell me? That you feel like Phil?

309
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:22,489
- Like Phil?
- Am I gonna be sittin' here some night...

310
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:25,826
...and some checkout girl
comes here looking for you?

311
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,037
No, no, of course not.

312
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,664
I know you're not happy here.

313
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:35,169
You're not happy at work.
I know how men think.

314
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:39,506
"I'm not happy here. I'm not
happy there. I'll be happy... here."

315
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:43,010
No.
You make me happy... here.

316
00:25:43,636 --> 00:25:44,887
No.

317
00:25:45,554 --> 00:25:49,266
- No, I make you feel trapped.
- No, you don't. It's not you.

318
00:25:49,642 --> 00:25:53,145
How do you think that makes me
feel when I hear you say that?

319
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:57,066
I didn't mean you.
It's me.

320
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:02,404
I... I just feel lost.

321
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:11,288
Kim was telling me
about this cattle drive thing.

322
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:12,623
Oh.

323
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:16,835
- Maybe you should go.
- What about Florida?

324
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:20,464
You'll be miserable in Florida.
You'll make me miserable.

325
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,967
- You hate my parents.
- I don't hate them.

326
00:26:22,967 --> 00:26:26,470
Come on, you have known my father
since you were 18 years old...

327
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,014
...and you've never
called him by his name.

328
00:26:29,014 --> 00:26:30,849
What is his name?

329
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:33,644
It's a joke.
I was just joking.

330
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:37,106
Look, I said I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna go.

331
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:39,608
You don't understand what I'm saying.

332
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:43,362
I'm not saying it's all right
if you don't wanna come with us.

333
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:47,282
I'm saying I don't want you to come.

334
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:56,709
Go away with Ed.
Take Phil.

335
00:26:56,917 --> 00:27:01,380
I am giving you these two weeks.
It's my present.

336
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,842
Go and find your smile.

337
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:09,847
What if I can't?

338
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,686
We'll jump off that bridge
when we come to it.

339
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:02,858
My ass hurts just watching this.

340
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,486
Are you kidding?
This is fantastic!

341
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:11,492
- I wonder if I could do that to Arlene?
- Forget about it already.

342
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:14,119
I could do it.
You've seen her ears.

343
00:28:15,996 --> 00:28:18,999
- They must be the guests.
- I wish you hadn't worn this jacket.

344
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:22,252
- Why not?
- It's got your name and your picture on it.

345
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:25,130
- It's a little grotesque.
- I'm proud of what I do.

346
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,633
So's the president.
He doesn't wear his picture.

347
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:31,637
- Hi. You guys guests here?
- Yeah. We just got in. I'm Mitch Robbins.

348
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:34,640
- Ed Furillo. I sell sporting goods.
- Show him your jacket.

349
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,517
I'm Phil Berquist.

350
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:39,895
I committed adultery.
Lost my job and my family.

351
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:44,233
- His jacket's being made.
- Oh, yeah.

352
00:28:44,316 --> 00:28:47,486
I'm Ben Jessup and this
is my son, Steve Jessup.

353
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,738
- Where you from?
- Baltimore.

354
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:52,908
- We have a dental practice there.
- You're both dentists?

355
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:57,037
Yes. We're black and we're dentists.
Let's not make an issue out of it.

356
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:00,582
They're not making an issue.
You're making an issue.

357
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,668
- Hi.
- Hello.

358
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:06,922
- Isn't this great?
- We're Ira and Barry Shalowitz.

359
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:10,551
- Ira and Barry, that's like the ice cream.
- No, that's us.

360
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:14,263
- We make Ira and Barry's ice cream.
- Really? I love that ice cream.

361
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:18,225
But on the commercials, it's
a different Ira and Barry. It's two...

362
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:20,644
- Good-looking guys.
- Models.

363
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,981
- If it was us, could you eat?

364
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,484
Who is that?

365
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,825
Hi.
I'm Bonnie Rayburn.

366
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:38,954
Actually, I was supposed to meet somebody here...

367
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:42,499
...but I got the message at the airport
that she's not coming and...

368
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,711
...I feel really out of place.
I'm thinking of leaving.

369
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:47,046
No, no, stay.

370
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,426
When I was alive,
I would have found her attractive.

371
00:29:55,346 --> 00:29:56,722
Howdy.

372
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:59,808
I'm Clay Stone
and this is my wife, Millie.

373
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,685
- How do.
- Howdy.

374
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:06,106
Welcome to the Stone ranch. Believe it
or not, that work you saw a while ago...

375
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,567
...y'all are gonna be doin' that
next two weeks.

376
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:09,943
Yahoo!

377
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,073
- That's a good "yahoo", son.
- Thank you.

378
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:17,493
This ranch has been in my family
for five generations.

379
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:21,080
We've always tried to live here
by the code of the Old West.

380
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,667
If you thought this was a dude ranch,
I hate to disappoint you.

381
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,920
This is not pretend.
This is a real working ranch.

382
00:30:28,712 --> 00:30:32,257
We've gotta move these animals
from here to our ranch in Colorado.

383
00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:36,428
- This is gonna be great.
- You may feel like bunch of pigs

384
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,599
...but we're gonna be watching you.
We're gonna see how you sit a horse.

385
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,728
And in a few days, you'll be rounding up
a herd and goin' after strays.

386
00:30:45,187 --> 00:30:49,191
And you're gonna be in some country
that's just as pretty as heaven.

387
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:52,820
Here's some folks you'll be
working with. This is TR and Jeff.

388
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,699
They're professional cowboys. Our trail
boss will be in in a couple of days.

389
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:59,201
This is the best Western chef going.

390
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:02,830
Cookie!
Tell'em what they're gonna eat.

391
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:06,583
You ain't gonna be gettin'
no nouveau almondine thin crust...

392
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,253
...bottled water, sauteed city food.

393
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,339
Food's brown, hot-and plenty of it.

394
00:31:13,173 --> 00:31:19,305
It's not that bad! Now, we're gonna go
to work in the morning. And I mean work.

395
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:23,142
You came out here city slickers.
You're gonna go home cowboys.

396
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:34,737
- What do you think?
- You look like one of the Village People.

397
00:32:02,765 --> 00:32:04,933
I'll take that shirt too.

398
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:12,524
Excuse me. Here, boy.
Here, boy!

399
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:50,020
Hey! You did it again!
Boy, you're gettin' great.

400
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:52,731
See?
There's nothin' too hard.

401
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:56,235
OK. Good.
You'll do it this time.

402
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:01,031
That's it.
Wrist, wrist, wrist, go.

403
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:04,034
- Will you stop kidding around?
- I'm not kidding around.

404
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:08,163
I'm not good with ropes. I can't even
take the string off a bakery box.

405
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,708
- This time, run!
- OK.

406
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:15,462
Woo-hoo!

407
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:17,339
Whoa!

408
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:21,010
- Everyone can do it but you. It's embrrassing.
- It's not a competition, Ed.

409
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,013
Everything's a competition.
Life's a competition.

410
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:26,056
Come on, try it again.

411
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:29,685
- How's it goin'?
- OK. Where have you been?

412
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:32,896
Oh, I was watching'em castrate a horse.

413
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:37,109
Well, I'm hungry.
How about you, hm?

414
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:40,988
- Can I help you with that?
- No, thanks. I think I'm getting it.

415
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,950
Are you?
Are you gettin' it?

416
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,330
- See what's going on?
- I'll take the big one.

417
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,332
Wait, wait a second.
We are guests here.

418
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:54,335
- Are you gonna wrestle the cowboys?
- I'm not gonna do nothing.

419
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,837
Wait, wait. Hey.
Let me handle this, OK?

420
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:59,715
You know how you get.
It'll be High Noon.

421
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:02,551
Come on.
Let me help you out.

422
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,762
Look, just leave me alone.

423
00:34:06,055 --> 00:34:08,432
I can't, you see.
I'm in love.

424
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,477
Hi, boys.
How are you?

425
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:15,439
I was just ropin' over there.
Thought I'd mosey on over.

426
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:18,859
You know, I've never moseyed before.
Hope I did it correctly.

427
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:21,987
I've walked, I've ambled.
I even sashayed once.

428
00:34:22,363 --> 00:34:24,865
But that was in front of the draft board.

429
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:31,038
Hello!

430
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,002
Rough corral.

431
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:39,880
- Bonnie, wanna rope with us?
- It's all right.

432
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,384
- I think that Bonnie's talking with us.
- She's fine right here.

433
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:47,846
Guys, what are you doing? This isn't
exactly '90s behaviour, I gotta be honest.

434
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:55,270
- You stepped on my foot.
- He did not, you horse's ass.

435
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,815
- Ed.
- You want a piece o' this?

436
00:34:57,856 --> 00:35:00,609
- Any time, Zeke.
- How about right now, Stubby?

437
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:01,944
Fine.

438
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:28,554
- This man owes you an apology.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.

439
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:31,098
- Not you. Him.
- Him. Of course.

440
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,563
No.

441
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:44,278
God, I'm sorry, ma'am.
That'll never happen again.

442
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:46,530
Yes, see that it doesn't.

443
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:51,118
I'm sorry, I thought
we were on the same...

444
00:35:51,118 --> 00:35:52,995
You're doing fine.

445
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:58,792
You guys were drinking.

446
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,341
Don't let it happen again.

447
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:18,937
Ma'am.

448
00:36:26,695 --> 00:36:28,697
Did you see that guy?

449
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:32,993
That is the toughest man
I've ever seen in my life.

450
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:40,167
Did you see how leathery he was?
He was like a saddlebag with eyes.

451
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:45,422
Listen, it took a lot of courage
to do what you did. Thank you.

452
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:50,302
I'm married.

453
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:04,650
You're wrong, Ed. I'm tellin' you.
It was not a stupid thing to say.

454
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,653
It was. She says "Thanks"
and you say "I'm married"?

455
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:08,988
Yeah.

456
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:12,491
I don't want any false flirtings.

457
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:15,619
"False flirtings"?
What if you're like me?

458
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,872
What if you don't encourage them
and they still chase you?

459
00:37:18,872 --> 00:37:24,128
It doesn't happen. Women need a reason
to have sex. Men just need a place.

460
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:28,716
- Good night. I'm going to bed.
- Good night. Sleep tight.

461
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:34,972
- That was flirting.
- No. That was politeness.

462
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:38,350
That was "Have a pleasant and restly evening."

463
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,979
No. That was "I like your ass.
Could I wear it as a hat?"

464
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:46,150
Say, uh... Phil was telling us you
had a little trouble with Jeff and TR.

465
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,987
- They were giving Bonnie a hard time.
- But he took care of it.

466
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:53,365
What made it worse was,
the trail boss comes over...

467
00:37:53,365 --> 00:37:54,742
Curly?

468
00:37:56,952 --> 00:37:59,204
His name is Curly?
Perfect.

469
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:03,751
You know what the cook said about him?
He killed a man in a knife fight.

470
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:06,462
He said he slit him from neck to nuts.

471
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:08,672
I'm not happy about this.

472
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:12,259
This guy's a cowboy.
One of the last real men.

473
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:14,511
He's untamed.
A mustang.

474
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:18,015
We're trained ponies. It'll do us
good to be in his world a while.

475
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:22,019
- "Do us good"? He was hanging the help.
- He was helping us.

476
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:26,357
This guy is not normal. Did you see
his eyes? He's got crazy eyes.

477
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:30,986
He's a lunatic. I'm tleein' you, we're going into
the wilderness being led by a lunatic.

478
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,739
He's behind me, isn't he?

479
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:38,869
- Time to turn in.
- Good night.

480
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,757
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by that.

481
00:38:51,882 --> 00:38:53,968
I crap bigger than you.

482
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:06,313
He's gonna kill me.

483
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:09,191
Watch it!
Excuse me. Whoa.

484
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:14,947
- Whoa!
- Great! You are riding so much better.

485
00:39:14,947 --> 00:39:18,075
Thanks.
I just talked to, uh... Nancy.

486
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,829
- Who's Nancy?
- She's the, uh... the girl.

487
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:24,915
Oh, the, uh... the girl.

488
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,751
- She's not pregnant.
- Really?

489
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,838
- Well, that's good, isn't it?
- For her.

490
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:33,757
So what does it mean?

491
00:39:34,258 --> 00:39:38,053
You know what I think?
Out there are all the answers.

492
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:42,182
No, Ed.
Out there...

493
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:47,730
...are cows, and plenty of'em.

494
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,983
We're gonna go 200 miles
with a big, moving stink.

495
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,401
OK.

496
00:39:53,152 --> 00:39:56,739
You guys are probably too young to
remember this, but when I was a kid...

497
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:59,742
...I remember seeing
a movie called Red River.

498
00:39:59,742 --> 00:40:03,287
- Oh, I've seen it on TV.
- But not in the movie theatre.

499
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:06,915
The big screen, with John Wayne
and Montgomery Clift.

500
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,169
Remember the scene,
the start of the cattle drive?

501
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:13,172
- Dad...
- No, no, son. That's why we're here.

502
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:16,091
- The "yee-ha" scene?
- The "yee-ha" scene.

503
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:20,471
Before they took the cattle out, those
cowboys waved their hats in the air...

504
00:40:21,096 --> 00:40:23,223
...and yelled "Yee-ha!"

505
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:27,478
- What do you say to that?
- All right! Move'em out.

506
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,110
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

507
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:37,738
- Ya-hoo!
- Ya-hoo!

508
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:39,281
Ya-hoo!

509
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:40,699
Yee-ha.

510
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:44,203
- Yee-haa!
- Yee-ha!

511
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:47,915
- Yee-ha!
- Yee-ha!

512
00:40:47,915 --> 00:40:49,333
Yee-ha!

513
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:53,045
- Feel like a schmuck?
- Oh, yeah. A big schmuck.

514
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,797
Yee-haa!

515
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:58,217
We'll see you in Colorado.

516
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,433
/* Fairy tales can come true

517
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,396
/* It can happen to you

518
00:41:11,438 --> 00:41:13,607
/* If you're young at heart

519
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:18,821
/* For it's hard, you will find

520
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:20,990
/* To be narrow of mind

521
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,702
/* If you're young at heart

522
00:41:27,287 --> 00:41:29,498
/* And if you should survive

523
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:31,667
/* To 105

524
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,962
/* Look at all you'll derive

525
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:37,715
/* Just by being alive

526
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,513
/* Now here is the best part

527
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:48,267
/* You have a head start

528
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,604
/* If you are amongst the very young

529
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:55,941
/* At heart

530
00:42:08,412 --> 00:42:10,998
Look, a stray.
You take him, Mitch.

531
00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:15,377
- No, it's the first one. You get him, Ed.
- No, let Phil have him.

532
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:19,214
- No, you get this one.
- Are you sure? There's gonna be plenty.

533
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:22,217
You get this one. I'll get the next one.
Then Ed, then you...

534
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:24,928
Like a round robin?
That's good, yeah.

535
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,723
- So who gets this one?
- You.

536
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:30,225
- Come on. Go!
- Out of shoot No.9!

537
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:31,977
Hey, go Mitchy!

538
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:36,523
No, no.
Don't go back there. No!

539
00:42:37,066 --> 00:42:39,652
Think I can't see you behind there?

540
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:41,445
Hello!

541
00:42:42,071 --> 00:42:44,239
Come on, now.
Here we go.

542
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:47,076
Come on now.
Here we go. Come on.

543
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:49,244
It's like chasing a mime.

544
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,960
Yee-ha, cowboy!

545
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:59,546
- All right!
- All right, Mitchy!

546
00:42:59,546 --> 00:43:01,507
I did it!
All right!

547
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:05,219
Uh-oh.
Hey, moonwalk.

548
00:43:07,096 --> 00:43:11,600
I'd like to thank
everybody for helping me get my stray in.

549
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:15,270
All right, all right.
Come on back.

550
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,191
All right, now, easy on the clutch.
Cut the wheel! Cut it, cut it.

551
00:43:19,274 --> 00:43:23,320
That's it. Straight back and park
and lock it. You got the keys, sir?

552
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:28,117
Whoo! I wish the kids coulda seen that.

553
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:31,453
Dump it into the personal,
then make out the cheque.

554
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:35,249
- He should know. He's our accountant.
- You're our accountant.

555
00:43:35,457 --> 00:43:38,961
- Don't... Just get a Mets score.
- Arnold, I'm losing you.

556
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:41,213
We're going behind a butte.

557
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:43,966
Arnold?
Arnold, what's the Mets score?

558
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:46,051
The Mets... I lost him.

559
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:15,247
Boy, that saddle's having all the fun.

560
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,541
You have, like, a half-track mind.

561
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:20,878
- You wouldn't screw her brains out?
- Lovely image.

562
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:25,591
It ranks up there with my other favourite
of yours: "Bang the shit out of her."

563
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:29,762
I'm sorry if I offended
your delicate sensibilities.

564
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:33,349
- You were staring at her pretty good.
- That's different.

565
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:35,351
- Different?
- Yeah.

566
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:39,396
Look. I go to an art gallery,
right? And I see a Picasso.

567
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:43,233
- Oh, she's a Picasso now?
- No, she's not a Picasso.

568
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:45,486
If she was, she'd have three tits.

569
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:50,491
What I'm saying is if I see a nice painting,
I look at it, but I don't pull it off the wall.

570
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,451
Let me ask you this.

571
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:56,288
What if you could have great sex
with someone attractive...

572
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:58,207
...and Barbara would never find out?

573
00:44:58,207 --> 00:45:01,126
It's a big trap. I mean,
look what happened to Phil.

574
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:04,129
The girl came to his house,
then she came to my house.

575
00:45:04,129 --> 00:45:05,464
Yeah.

576
00:45:06,632 --> 00:45:10,636
- Let's say a spaceship lands.
- Good, reality. Are you listening to this?

577
00:45:10,636 --> 00:45:14,515
A spaceship lands and the most beautiful
woman you ever saw gets out.

578
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:18,602
All she wants to do is have
the greatest sex in the universe with you.

579
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:22,648
- Could happen.
- When it's over, she flies away for ever.

580
00:45:23,107 --> 00:45:26,777
No one will ever know.
You're telling me you wouldn't do it?

581
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:32,992
No. It just what you describing actually happened
to my cousin Ronald. And his wife did find out about

582
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:36,036
- They know everything there.
- Forget about it.

583
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:39,498
I'm saying it wouldn't make
it all right if Barbara didn't know.

584
00:45:39,498 --> 00:45:42,501
I'd know, and I wouldn't
like myself. That's all.

585
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:46,588
- Pay attention, girls. We got strays.
- Hi, Curly. Kill anyone today?

586
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:49,550
Day ain't over yet.

587
00:45:56,432 --> 00:45:58,809
I wonder what Barbara's doing.

588
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,187
You're really with just
one woman for 15 years? Just one?

589
00:46:02,187 --> 00:46:06,400
Yes, Ed. I'm married. I caught my limit.
Why are you after me about this?

590
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:13,240
Let's say... all your life, for breakfast,
you eat from the Kellogg's variety pack.

591
00:46:13,615 --> 00:46:17,578
- And a spaceship lands.
- No. Then you don't get the variety pack.

592
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:21,707
You pick one, your favourite one,
and you just get that one from then on.

593
00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:25,085
Every day for the rest of your life,
the same cereal.

594
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:28,672
Then you wake up one morning...
and you're just not hungry any more.

595
00:46:28,672 --> 00:46:30,883
You can't get an erection.

596
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:34,762
Hey, pal. I can get an erection
any time I want. Watch.

597
00:46:34,762 --> 00:46:39,516
Ed, please don't. Leave the stallion in the
corral. You'll knock me into the fire, OK?

598
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:44,647
See, here's the thing.

599
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:48,025
- Kim wants to have kids.
- And you don't?

600
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,862
I say it's because
we wouldn't have as much fun.

601
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:54,198
But that's not the reason.

602
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:57,576
Having a kid, that's heavy.
That's a real commitment.

603
00:46:58,077 --> 00:47:02,164
That's saying I'm never gonna be with
another woman for the rest of my life.

604
00:47:02,164 --> 00:47:04,667
Wait a minute, let me get this straight.

605
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:07,836
I have no life.
We're all agreed on that, right?

606
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:10,005
- Right.
- OK.

607
00:47:10,047 --> 00:47:12,549
Your big problem
is that you're married...

608
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:15,552
...to this gorgeous
24-year-old underwear model...

609
00:47:15,552 --> 00:47:20,099
...who thinks the sun rises and sets in your
pants, and that's not enough for you?

610
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:23,769
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.

611
00:47:24,561 --> 00:47:27,731
- I don't wanna screw around on Kim.
- So don't.

612
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,400
Oh.

613
00:47:29,566 --> 00:47:31,819
From the king of restraint.

614
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,197
- What does that mean?
- It means that's pretty smug advice...

615
00:47:35,197 --> 00:47:39,743
...from a man who mounted an 18-year-old
checkout girl on the day-old bread rack.

616
00:47:39,785 --> 00:47:43,122
- She's 20, and shut up.
- Let me get you hot, Phil.

617
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:46,542
- "I need a price, register nine."
- Cut it out.

618
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,879
What'd you use for protection?
Paper or plastic?

619
00:47:50,963 --> 00:47:53,424
- Come on!
- We're on vacation!

620
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,598
- You're spookin' the cattle.
- We were just fooling around.

621
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:03,434
See you tomorrow.

622
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:07,438
Sunup.

623
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:16,488
- Morning.
- Hi.

624
00:48:16,488 --> 00:48:19,491
- You done with that?
- Yeah, help yourself.

625
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:21,744
See, Mom, we're keeping clean.

626
00:48:21,744 --> 00:48:24,538
It's cold... but I'm a real pioneer man.

627
00:48:31,754 --> 00:48:34,006
- Morning.
- Good morning.

628
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:38,510
Come on, guys.
You're sorry, you're sorry.

629
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:40,846
Let's make up, huh?

630
00:48:46,935 --> 00:48:48,479
All right.

631
00:48:50,314 --> 00:48:52,733
- My fault.
- No, it's all right.

632
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:56,737
Gotta celebrate. I got a special treat.
I'm gonna make fresh coffee.

633
00:48:56,862 --> 00:49:00,616
Battery-operated. Instantly grinds
its own beans. Only 19.95.

634
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:04,119
- Come on, why live like animals?
- That's great.

635
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:06,121
First cup's for my good friend Phil.

636
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:09,625
When we were kids, he used to
let me watch his sister undress.

637
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,628
I never forgot it, Phil...
cos I still do it. OK.

638
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:23,430
Wow.
Something's spookin' the cattle.

639
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:26,308
Look, look.
The cows are going away.

640
00:49:31,021 --> 00:49:33,899
- Wow, look at'em go.
- That is amazing.

641
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:36,568
- Stampede!
- We gotta get'em.

642
00:49:39,488 --> 00:49:40,489
Whoa!

643
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:43,617
- Beautiful. Get that in the frame.
- I got it.

644
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,552
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die. Oh, God.

645
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:03,554
They're comin' at us!

646
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,275
- Come on!
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

647
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:29,413
Bonnie, there's a stampede...

648
00:50:29,413 --> 00:50:31,165
...in your tent.

649
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:36,897
City folk.

650
00:51:44,488 --> 00:51:50,369
I'm sorry. I mean, I was just tryin'
to make a cup of coffee. That's all.

651
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:54,915
It was... it was French roast.

652
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,920
There's still a few head missin'.
Must have gone into that canyon.

653
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:03,007
- TR and I'll get'em.
- No, I'll get'em...

654
00:52:03,549 --> 00:52:05,134
...with you.

655
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:08,304
- Me?
- Yeah.

656
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:12,099
- You're comin' with me.
- Just the two of us?

657
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:17,563
You move the herd.
I'll catch up.

658
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:20,482
- You mean, we'll catch up.
- Let's go.

659
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:33,829
Bye.

660
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,045
Curly, did I ever show you pictures of
my wife and kids? I'm their sole support.

661
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:45,174
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Sure.

662
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:49,261
Curly's just trying to scare him.
You know Mitch. He's a wise ass.

663
00:52:50,346 --> 00:52:52,765
If anything happens to him...

664
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:56,060
...I'm going after Barbara.

665
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:05,903
Throw a rope on this'un so we
can go after the others. Rope him.

666
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:09,031
I'm not good at it.
I have a roping disability.

667
00:53:22,628 --> 00:53:25,005
- Be right with you.

668
00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:32,596
Jesus Christ.

669
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,061
Hey.
See, I'm good at this part.

670
00:53:39,603 --> 00:53:41,105
Throw it.

671
00:53:51,824 --> 00:53:54,743
You know what just occurred to me?
Roping is stupid.

672
00:53:54,743 --> 00:53:58,414
This is a cow, not a gazelle.
Watch. Get off the horse, huh?

673
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:05,713
Then you walk up to the cow.
Look how good this is working.

674
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:10,301
Then you say "Hi, Bob Vila for This
Old Herd. We're gonna rope you today."

675
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:14,096
Then you take Mr Loop
and put it around the head of Mr Cow.

676
00:54:19,977 --> 00:54:22,730
- What's wrong with that?

677
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,819
- That!
- I'm on vacation!

678
00:54:39,747 --> 00:54:41,999
- Is that it?
- That's it.

679
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:48,380
- What are we doing?
- Making camp.

680
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:53,427
Too late to catch up with the herd
before dark. We'll catch up tomorrow.

681
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:57,264
You mean we're gonna
sleep out here? Just...

682
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:00,934
That's right.

683
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,482
Oh, God.
It's Deliverance.

684
00:55:16,075 --> 00:55:18,160
Getting ready to shave?

685
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:22,456
You make a lot of... smart remarks
at my expense, don't you?

686
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:27,086
I'm joking.
I do with everybody.

687
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:30,965
It's just my way.

688
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,884
I don't understand that way.

689
00:55:40,724 --> 00:55:42,434
Put that away.

690
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:49,775
I said... put that away.

691
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:58,075
You know, the first time I tried
to talk to you, you embarrassed me.

692
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:02,496
So I teased you a little bit, which maybe
I shouldn't have done. So I'm sorry.

693
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:05,582
Now you're playing with your knife,
trying to frighten me...

694
00:56:05,582 --> 00:56:08,127
...which you're doing a good job...

695
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:12,089
But if you're gonna kill me...
get on with it.

696
00:56:12,089 --> 00:56:14,258
If not, shut the hell up.

697
00:56:16,093 --> 00:56:17,886
I'm on vacation.

698
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,957
/* See them tumbling down

699
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:51,920
/* Pledging their love to the ground

700
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:55,257
/* Lonely but free I'll be found

701
00:56:56,342 --> 00:56:59,428
/* Driftin' along
/with the tumblin' tumbleweeds

702
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:05,726
/* Cares of the past are behind

703
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:09,688
/* Nowhere to go but I'll find

704
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:14,818
/* Just where the trail will wind

705
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:20,449
/* Drifting along
/with the tumblin' tumbleweeds

706
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,169
Do you know any show tunes?

707
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:35,839
The second it's over,
she'll get back into her spaceship...

708
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,841
...and fly away for eternity.

709
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:40,594
- Would you do it?
- Is she a redhead?

710
00:57:42,346 --> 00:57:43,847
Could be.

711
00:57:44,848 --> 00:57:46,642
I like redheads.

712
00:57:50,854 --> 00:57:53,273
- You ever been married?
- No.

713
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:57,903
You ever been in love?

714
00:57:59,863 --> 00:58:01,281
Once...

715
00:58:02,366 --> 00:58:04,868
I was drivin' a herd across the Panhandle.

716
00:58:04,868 --> 00:58:06,745
- Texas.
- Mm-hm.

717
00:58:08,497 --> 00:58:11,917
Passed near this little dirt farm
round about sundown.

718
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:16,380
Out in the field was this young woman...

719
00:58:16,505 --> 00:58:18,757
...working down in the dirt.

720
00:58:19,508 --> 00:58:22,761
Just about then,
she stood up to stretch her back.

721
00:58:25,514 --> 00:58:31,020
She was wearing a little cotton dress,
and the settin' sun was right behind her...

722
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:34,940
...showing the shape
that God had give her.

723
00:58:35,524 --> 00:58:37,234
What happened?

724
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:41,363
I just turned around and rode away.

725
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:43,574
Why?

726
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:48,579
I figured it wasn't gonna get
any better than that.

727
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:52,041
Yeah, but you could've been,
you know... with her.

728
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:54,209
I been with lots of women.

729
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:57,921
Yeah, but, you know, she could've
been the love of your life.

730
00:58:58,213 --> 00:58:59,632
She is.

731
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:03,761
That's great.
That's... not great.

732
00:59:04,428 --> 00:59:08,599
No, that's wrong. You passed up
something that might have been terrific.

733
00:59:08,932 --> 00:59:11,935
- My choice.
- I never could have done that.

734
00:59:11,935 --> 00:59:13,854
That's your choice.

735
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:18,651
A cowboy leads a different kind of life.
When there were cowboys.

736
00:59:20,903 --> 00:59:22,863
We're a dyin' breed.

737
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:27,951
Still means somethin' to me, though.

738
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:31,747
In a couple of days,
we'll move this herd across the river...

739
00:59:33,457 --> 00:59:35,876
...drive'em through the valley.

740
00:59:38,462 --> 00:59:41,256
There's nothin' like bringin' in a herd.

741
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:44,635
See, now that's great.
Your life makes sense to you.

742
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:50,391
- What's so funny?
- You city folk worry about a lot of shit.

743
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:54,812
Shit? My wife basically told me
she doesn't want me around.

744
00:59:55,646 --> 00:59:57,481
Is she a redhead?

745
00:59:57,648 --> 01:00:00,442
- I'm just saying...
- How old are you?

746
01:00:00,651 --> 01:00:02,277
- 38.
- 39.

747
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,073
Y'all come up here about
the same age. Same problems.

748
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:09,535
Spend about 50 weeks a year
gettin' knots in your rope.

749
01:00:09,576 --> 01:00:12,997
Then you think two weeks
up here'll untie'em for you.

750
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,499
None of you get it.

751
01:00:18,085 --> 01:00:21,463
- Do you know what the secret of life is?
- No. What?

752
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:25,092
- This.
- Your finger?

753
01:00:25,634 --> 01:00:27,845
One thing.
Just one thing.

754
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:33,183
You stick to that and
everything else don't mean shit.

755
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:36,437
That's great,
but... what's the one thing?

756
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:40,357
That's what you gotta figure out.

757
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,409
Oh, damn it.
Come on!

758
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,086
- What's goin' on?
- This cow's having a baby.

759
01:01:05,382 --> 01:01:07,384
I noticed it when we found her.

760
01:01:07,384 --> 01:01:11,263
I was hopin' she'd make it
through the drive, but... she's ready.

761
01:01:11,388 --> 01:01:13,432
Does she do it herself?
Or do you help her?

762
01:01:13,432 --> 01:01:16,268
I'll hold her down.
You deliver the calf.

763
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:19,438
Excuse me? Hello?
Why don't I hold her down?

764
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:24,443
You don't know how. She'll kick you
and kill you, and her and the calf.

765
01:01:24,443 --> 01:01:27,863
- That's too much for me to carry back.
- I see your point.

766
01:01:27,863 --> 01:01:29,865
Come on.
She's ready.

767
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:34,036
- I...
- She's burstin'!

768
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:36,455
Oh, God.
There's gonna be bursting?

769
01:01:36,455 --> 01:01:39,083
Just reach in and pull out the calf.

770
01:01:53,889 --> 01:01:55,182
Ooh.

771
01:02:00,813 --> 01:02:04,942
- You know, this was not in the brochure.
- She needs help, goddamn it!

772
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:12,741
What's taking so long?
Do you see the head?

773
01:02:15,452 --> 01:02:16,453
Ugh.

774
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:22,960
- I only see a tail.
- Oh, shit.

775
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,921
It's turned the wrong way.
Get it out.

776
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:29,008
Uh-oh.

777
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:30,968
- My watch came off.
- Now!

778
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:33,178
- It was a gift!
- Do it!

779
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:37,433
Come on.

780
01:02:55,826 --> 01:02:58,871
- Oh, Jesus.
- Look what I did! I made a cow.

781
01:03:03,834 --> 01:03:06,545
This is unbelievable.
This is amazing.

782
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:09,965
He looks like you.

783
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,801
Look at him.
Yeah. Get up.

784
01:03:14,178 --> 01:03:16,263
- Oh, shit.

785
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:20,726
Look at this.
He's walking already.

786
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:24,605
He's a genius. He gets that
from my side of the family.

787
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:27,149
We all walk very early.

788
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:32,571
I'm gonna name him Norman.
You know, cos years ago...

789
01:03:37,534 --> 01:03:40,329
- Why did you do that?
- She was dying.

790
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:44,667
And she was suffering.

791
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,087
We saved the calf.

792
01:03:53,217 --> 01:03:55,052
Good job, cowboy.

793
01:04:08,774 --> 01:04:11,860
There you go, Norman.
You are only down a quart.

794
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,614
That's really wonderful.
You got him to drink from the bottle.

795
01:04:16,448 --> 01:04:19,451
Yeah, thank God,
cos my nipples were killing me.

796
01:04:20,995 --> 01:04:24,999
What do you think? What would be
the perfect flavour with this meal?

797
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,710
- Cherry vanilla?
- No.

798
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:31,880
If it was Chinese food, right on
the money, but this... toasted almonds.

799
01:04:35,384 --> 01:04:36,302
What's goin' on?

800
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:40,347
Barry can pick out the right flavour
of ice cream to follow any meal.

801
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:44,226
Go ahead.
Challenge him.

802
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:48,480
- "Challenge him"?
- Come on.

803
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,525
Franks and beans.

804
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:55,279
Scoop of chocolate, scoop of vanilla.
Don't waste my time.

805
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:05,581
Come on.
Push me.

806
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,464
- Sea bass.
- Grilled?

807
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,051
- Sauteed.
- I'm with ya.

808
01:05:17,843 --> 01:05:19,762
Potatoes au gratin.

809
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:24,767
Asparagus.

810
01:05:32,483 --> 01:05:34,068
Rum raisin.

811
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,072
Woof!

812
01:05:38,072 --> 01:05:40,783
Woof what?
How do you know he's right?

813
01:05:41,116 --> 01:05:45,454
How do we know? 1400 retail outlets
across the country. That's how we know.

814
01:05:48,082 --> 01:05:49,375
Woof!

815
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:51,877
Will you stop
with Roberto Clemente?

816
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:54,964
Henry Aaron was the greatest
right fielder of our generation.

817
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:58,717
- Could he run like Clemente?
- I'm gonna say one thing to you.

818
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:00,803
755 home runs.
Goodbye.

819
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:03,931
Clemente was killed in a plane crash.

820
01:06:03,931 --> 01:06:07,434
- You're gonna blame that on Aaron?
- No. I'm just saying.

821
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:10,813
- Oh, baseball.
- You got something against baseball?

822
01:06:11,188 --> 01:06:15,859
I used to live with a guy who was like a
baseball encyclopaedia. I just got flashes.

823
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:18,988
- You broke up with him cos of baseball?
- Uh, no.

824
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:22,741
We had different needs. I needed him
to treat me decently and get a job.

825
01:06:22,741 --> 01:06:25,661
He needed to empty
my bank account and leave.

826
01:06:25,661 --> 01:06:26,996
Ouch.

827
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,292
- So do you hate baseball?
- No, I like baseball.

828
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:35,546
I just never understood how you guys
can spend so much time discussing it.

829
01:06:35,546 --> 01:06:38,340
I've been to games,
but I don't memorise...

830
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,510
...who played third base
for Pittsburgh in 1960.

831
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:43,137
Don Hoak.

832
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:46,223
- Beat you.
- See, that's exactly what I mean.

833
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:50,102
So what do you and your friends
talk about out there?

834
01:06:50,894 --> 01:06:52,771
Well... real life.

835
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,526
Relationships.
Are they working, are they not?

836
01:06:57,943 --> 01:06:59,945
Who's she seeing.
Is that working?

837
01:06:59,945 --> 01:07:02,656
- No contest. We win.
- Why?

838
01:07:03,615 --> 01:07:07,745
Honey, if that were
as interesting as baseball...

839
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:11,290
...they'd have cards for it
and sell it with gum.

840
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:16,670
Ed, I see by the sun
it's time for you to hibernate again.

841
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:19,923
You're right, I suppose.
I guess it is childish...

842
01:07:19,923 --> 01:07:22,343
...but when I was about 18...

843
01:07:23,427 --> 01:07:27,348
...and my dad and I couldn't
communicate about anything at all...

844
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:30,601
...we could still talk about baseball.

845
01:07:31,727 --> 01:07:33,604
Now that was real.

846
01:07:38,692 --> 01:07:41,320
You know what the secret of life is?

847
01:07:41,362 --> 01:07:42,905
It's this.

848
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:46,659
One thing.
Just one thing.

849
01:07:48,243 --> 01:07:50,913
- And what's that?
- I have no idea.

850
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,249
But ask Curly cos he seems to know.

851
01:07:54,249 --> 01:07:57,127
- Curly knows the secret of life?
- Yeah.

852
01:07:57,753 --> 01:08:00,464
I'm gonna invite him over.
He's a very interesting guy.

853
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:02,216
I'm sure he is.

854
01:08:08,973 --> 01:08:10,557
Hey, Curly.

855
01:08:11,558 --> 01:08:13,936
Curly?
Curl, you got a minute?

856
01:08:16,063 --> 01:08:21,443
He is a real cowboy. He sleeps with his
eyes open so he can still watch the herd.

857
01:08:24,488 --> 01:08:26,115
Curl.
Curly?

858
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:46,719
Is this all right? Do you need, like, a
licence or something to bury somebody?

859
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:50,055
Nah. This is where
Curly'd wanna be buried.

860
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:53,600
He said he was a dying breed.
I didn't know he meant on this trip.

861
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,229
The man ate bacon at every meal.
I mean, you can't do that.

862
01:08:57,896 --> 01:09:00,024
Well, I guess that's it.

863
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:03,902
Wait a minute. Shouldn't somebody
say something? Like a eulogy.

864
01:09:04,111 --> 01:09:06,780
- Yeah.
- Cookie, you knew him best.

865
01:09:12,536 --> 01:09:16,999
Lord, we give you Curly.
Try not to piss him off.

866
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:19,335
That's it?

867
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:22,046
What else is there?
I got chicken burning.

868
01:09:22,046 --> 01:09:25,257
You're a warm man, Cookie.
Wait a second. I'll...

869
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,722
What can I say about Curly?

870
01:09:31,972 --> 01:09:34,975
I didn't know you well,
but I'll never forget you.

871
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:38,479
You lived life on your terms -
simple, honest and brave.

872
01:09:40,481 --> 01:09:43,484
I'm glad for this short time
that we spent together.

873
01:09:43,484 --> 01:09:45,069
Amen.

874
01:09:45,527 --> 01:09:46,862
Amen.

875
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:57,373
Do you think this is all right?
With them?

876
01:09:57,373 --> 01:10:01,585
All right, listen up. Ben, I want you
to take the left flank with TR and Bonnie.

877
01:10:01,585 --> 01:10:04,088
I want you three boys to ride point.

878
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:06,924
I'm gonna push with Steve, Barry and Ira.

879
01:10:06,966 --> 01:10:09,426
Yeah, they're pros.
It'll be OK.

880
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,203
So long, cowboy.

881
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:57,349
- You know, it makes you stop and think.
- Stop the clock.

882
01:10:57,349 --> 01:11:00,144
- That's 25 minutes. I win.
- Win what?

883
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:04,773
I had under a half an hour
before you started to talk about death.

884
01:11:04,857 --> 01:11:07,359
Why would you think
I would talk about death?

885
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,071
We just came from a funeral.
And it's your favourite subject.

886
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:13,782
It is not. I think
when you see a life end...

887
01:11:13,782 --> 01:11:16,785
...it's a natural time to think
about your own mortality.

888
01:11:16,785 --> 01:11:19,496
No, it isn't.
Why do that to yourself?

889
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:22,291
When somebody dies,
I don't change places with him.

890
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,793
I appreciate the fact that I'm not dead.

891
01:11:24,793 --> 01:11:28,297
Look at this. It's a beautiful day.
I'm here with my best friends.

892
01:11:28,297 --> 01:11:31,050
We're driving a herd of cattle
across the plains.

893
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,595
Pretty goddamn great.
It's one of the best days of my life.

894
01:11:34,595 --> 01:11:37,598
All right. What is the best day of your life?

895
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,226
- You mean ever?
- Yeah. Best day ever in your whole life.

896
01:11:41,644 --> 01:11:45,272
And you can't do when your kids
were born. That's too easy.

897
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:46,982
I got one.

898
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:50,944
I'm seven years old and my dad
takes me to Yankee Stadium.

899
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:52,655
My first game.

900
01:11:52,946 --> 01:11:56,450
We're going in this long,
dark tunnel underneath the stands.

901
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:00,496
I'm holding his hand and we come up
out of the tunnel into the light.

902
01:12:01,705 --> 01:12:06,335
It was huge. How green
the grass was. Brown the dirt.

903
01:12:07,211 --> 01:12:10,172
And that great green
copper roof. Remember?

904
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:14,718
We had a black-and-white TV, so this
was the first game I ever saw in colour.

905
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,262
I sat there the whole game
next to my Dad.

906
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:19,682
He taught me how to keep score.

907
01:12:20,265 --> 01:12:22,184
Mickey hit one out.

908
01:12:22,768 --> 01:12:25,646
- Good day.
- I still have the programme.

909
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:30,567
All right, what was
the worst day you ever had?

910
01:12:32,611 --> 01:12:36,073
Worst day. A couple of years ago,
Barbara finds a lump.

911
01:12:36,115 --> 01:12:38,117
- What?
- Jesus.

912
01:12:38,117 --> 01:12:41,286
- It scared the shit out of me.
- You never said anything.

913
01:12:41,286 --> 01:12:45,207
Yeah, well, it turned out to be
nothing. But that whole day was...

914
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,628
- Yeah, but that was a good day.
- How?

915
01:12:49,628 --> 01:12:54,258
- Because it turned out to be nothing.
- Yeah, but the day until then was horrible.

916
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:56,635
Yeah, but it came out good.

917
01:12:56,635 --> 01:13:00,639
You're a real "the glass is half-empty"
kind of a guy, you know that?

918
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:03,058
I don't know how Barbara can stand it.

919
01:13:03,058 --> 01:13:04,393
Yeah.

920
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,062
All right. I got one.
My best day.

921
01:13:07,062 --> 01:13:09,231
The one about Arlene
and that loose step?

922
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:11,317
No.
No, my wedding day.

923
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:14,611
- What?
- Yeah. Remember that day?

924
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:20,367
Outdoor wedding. Arlene looked great.
Those water pills really worked.

925
01:13:20,868 --> 01:13:25,414
You guys are all smiling at me.
And my dad, in the front...

926
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:29,001
...gives me a little wink... you know?

927
01:13:29,835 --> 01:13:33,631
I mean, he's not the warmest
of men... but he winked.

928
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:36,925
I was the first to get married
and have a real job.

929
01:13:36,925 --> 01:13:39,595
I remember thinking "I'm grown-up."

930
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:43,849
You know? "I'm not a goofball
any more. I made it."

931
01:13:45,476 --> 01:13:47,353
I felt like a man.

932
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:50,814
It's the best day of my life.

933
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:55,069
- What was your worst day?
- Every day since is a tie.

934
01:13:58,864 --> 01:14:02,368
All right, Ed. Your best day.
What is it, twins in a trapeze?

935
01:14:02,368 --> 01:14:04,870
- No, I don't wanna play.
- We did it.

936
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:06,872
I don't feel like it.

937
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:08,332
OK.

938
01:14:13,837 --> 01:14:17,174
I'm 14 and my mother and
father are fighting again.

939
01:14:17,341 --> 01:14:20,344
You know, because she caught
him again. Caught him!

940
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:23,764
This time, the girl drove
by the house to pick him up.

941
01:14:25,224 --> 01:14:30,521
I finally realised he wasn't just cheating
on my mother. He was cheating on us.

942
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:36,527
So I told him. I said "You're bad
to us. We don't love you."

943
01:14:37,152 --> 01:14:41,156
"I'll take care of my mother and my sister.
We don't need you any more."

944
01:14:41,156 --> 01:14:44,535
He made like he was gonna
hit me, but I didn't budge.

945
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,288
Then he turned around and he left.
Never bothered us again.

946
01:14:49,748 --> 01:14:53,252
But I took care of my mother
and my sister from that day on.

947
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:55,170
That's my best day.

948
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,507
What was your worst day?

949
01:14:59,091 --> 01:15:00,592
Same day.

950
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:08,309
He gets the sign from Berra...

951
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:10,436
He gets the sign from Berra.
The pitch.

952
01:15:10,436 --> 01:15:11,770
Whoa!

953
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:26,702
/* Rollin', rollin', rollin"

954
01:15:26,702 --> 01:15:28,912
/* Keep them dogies rollin"

955
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:30,956
/* Man, my ass is swollen

956
01:15:30,956 --> 01:15:32,499
/* Rawhide!

957
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,960
/* Get'em up, move'em out,
/wake'em up, get'em dressed

958
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,962
/* Get'em shaved,
/comb their hair, rawhide

959
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:39,965
/* Tie me down, tell me lies,
/pull my hair, smack my thighs

960
01:15:39,965 --> 01:15:42,468
/* With a big wet strap of rawhide

961
01:15:57,316 --> 01:15:59,151
What is he doing?

962
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:03,822
Whoa, boy!

963
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:06,784
- He's drunk, the old shithead.
- Where'd he get the liquor?

964
01:16:06,784 --> 01:16:10,579
- How do I know that?
- Goddamn, we better get him outta there.

965
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,962
- Is that a happy face?

966
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,964
He's nuts.

967
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:27,763
- He's throwing our food.
- Well, we'll...

968
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:30,099
We'll what?
We'll order out?!

969
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,319
- He's headed for the ravine.
- I'm sure he sees it.

970
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:46,824
- Jump!

971
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:02,923
What can you say about
Skyrocket and Buttercup?

972
01:17:02,923 --> 01:17:07,094
- Let's just get out of here.
- Let's recap on what we've buried so far.

973
01:17:07,386 --> 01:17:11,223
- Trail boss, two horses...
- I can't believe we buried horses.

974
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:15,561
The impact drove'em into the ground.
We just covered'em up with some dirt.

975
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:19,732
- How do we move the food and the tents?
- Tents roll up.

976
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:23,319
We can pack enough food in
our saddlebags to get us there.

977
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:25,362
OK.
Let's do it.

978
01:17:25,571 --> 01:17:29,199
The problem is Cookie.
Let's no forget his legs are broken.

979
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:31,827
Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.

980
01:17:31,827 --> 01:17:35,456
We put Cookie on this litter
so we can get him out of here.

981
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:38,876
Me and TR are gonna stay
with you all and the herd.

982
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:42,046
We're gonna be hittin'
some pretty rough mountain country.

983
01:17:42,046 --> 01:17:46,300
There's a town, it's about half a day's
ride outta here. I can draw a map.

984
01:17:46,717 --> 01:17:49,595
Somebody's gotta take
Cookie. Volunteers?

985
01:17:56,644 --> 01:17:59,438
- I guess Steve and I should go.
- Why?

986
01:18:00,147 --> 01:18:02,650
He's injured and
we have medical training.

987
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:05,569
We're dentists!
Are we gonna give him a cleaning?

988
01:18:05,569 --> 01:18:08,781
We have a better chance
of helping than anyone, son.

989
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:11,617
- But you're having fun.
- Ride with me.

990
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,370
It will still be fun.
Huh?

991
01:18:17,164 --> 01:18:20,501
- That's really great of you, Ben, Steve.
- Thanks a lot.

992
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:22,294
- Thanks, Ben.
- Good luck.

993
01:18:22,294 --> 01:18:25,339
- Thank you, Dr Jessup.
- We would have gone, but...

994
01:18:25,339 --> 01:18:27,633
Good.
I'll make up that map.

995
01:18:29,385 --> 01:18:32,388
Hey, look. I found where
Cookie was hiding his whisky.

996
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:34,723
- You old coot.
- Hey, Jeff.

997
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:41,855
- Shouldn't we do something?
- Let'em have fun, then they'll sleep it off.

998
01:18:44,066 --> 01:18:46,568
I knew we couldn't trust these guys.

999
01:18:46,568 --> 01:18:50,030
I said "Tennis camp."
You said "Let's drive cattle."

1000
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,366
Wait a minute.
I got an idea.

1001
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,580
- Look at this.
- Norman.

1002
01:18:59,832 --> 01:19:02,835
- Norman.
- What are they doing with Norman?

1003
01:19:03,335 --> 01:19:06,005
Mitchy!
Mitchy, come on out and play.

1004
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:10,592
- Don't go out there.
- What do you think, I'm nuts?

1005
01:19:12,928 --> 01:19:15,347
Mitch, do you like calf brains?

1006
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,478
- This is over a cow.
- Here's your last chance.

1007
01:19:21,729 --> 01:19:25,441
- They won't hurt me. There's witnesses.
- Please be careful.

1008
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:29,194
They're just gonna
embarrass me, so I'll let'em.

1009
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,744
Norman, have you been
bothering the cowboys again?

1010
01:19:37,328 --> 01:19:40,372
You raise them, you try
to teach them right from wrong...

1011
01:19:40,372 --> 01:19:44,627
...but they learn these things from
their friends. It's the school systems.

1012
01:19:49,506 --> 01:19:51,634
You're grounded, mister.

1013
01:19:53,218 --> 01:19:55,262
These cows today, huh?

1014
01:19:58,724 --> 01:20:00,851
You pansy-assed bastard.

1015
01:20:01,435 --> 01:20:05,356
- Are you talking to me or Norman?
- You shit-nosed little faggot.

1016
01:20:06,565 --> 01:20:08,025
Who, me?

1017
01:20:09,777 --> 01:20:13,781
Listen, guys. We have a group of people
here who came out for a good time...

1018
01:20:13,781 --> 01:20:17,242
...and to say the least,
it's been a little bit strange.

1019
01:20:19,161 --> 01:20:21,664
But we're counting on you
to get us through this.

1020
01:20:21,664 --> 01:20:26,627
So I'm asking you, please, why don't
you just go and sleep it off, huh?

1021
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:29,505
Sleep this off.

1022
01:20:36,679 --> 01:20:38,097
Yee-ha!

1023
01:20:49,566 --> 01:20:52,528
Put the gun down!
Put down the goddamn gun!

1024
01:20:58,075 --> 01:21:01,745
- Phil.
- I'm not gonna let him bully us any more.

1025
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:04,999
- My father-in-law's a bully
- Phil.

1026
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:06,750
I hate bullies!

1027
01:21:08,502 --> 01:21:11,171
Cos a bully doesn't just beat you up.

1028
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,591
- He takes away your dignity.
- Phil!

1029
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:16,510
I hate that.

1030
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:19,430
I really... hate that.

1031
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,226
Sorry.

1032
01:21:27,563 --> 01:21:28,897
Bang!

1033
01:21:33,986 --> 01:21:36,989
All right, you two assholes, go sleep it off.

1034
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:46,624
And let's have some peace and quiet
around here for Christ's sakes!

1035
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:51,420
I'm tired.
I've been under a lot of stress.

1036
01:21:53,172 --> 01:21:55,549
I lost my wife.
I lost my job.

1037
01:21:57,676 --> 01:22:01,347
And I've got some sort of rash...
from making in the bushes.

1038
01:22:08,228 --> 01:22:10,481
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1039
01:22:24,536 --> 01:22:26,955
Phil, thanks.
That was amazing.

1040
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:31,251
- What?
- You know, uh...

1041
01:22:32,544 --> 01:22:34,296
Oh, that.
Yeah.

1042
01:22:37,549 --> 01:22:40,219
Why don't you put the gun down, Phil?

1043
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:44,056
Oh, you don't have to worry.
I know how to handle a gun.

1044
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:46,809
I used to keep one at the store.

1045
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:50,354
You lock up late at night,
there's a lot of cash around.

1046
01:22:52,356 --> 01:22:56,110
You gotta make sure that
the register totals match the cash...

1047
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,737
...and cheques and the coupons.

1048
01:22:59,863 --> 01:23:03,242
You got the order forms
to fill out for the next day.

1049
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:06,662
You gotta check the stock.
I mean, there's a lot to do there.

1050
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:08,956
It's a very responsible job.

1051
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,465
Oh, Christ.

1052
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,470
Oh, Phil.
Come on, Philly.

1053
01:23:24,763 --> 01:23:27,224
Come on, man.
It's not that bad.

1054
01:23:27,266 --> 01:23:31,103
I'm at a dead end. I'm almost
40 years old. I've wasted my life.

1055
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:35,691
Yeah, but now you got
a chance to start over. You know?

1056
01:23:38,819 --> 01:23:41,322
Phil, remember when we were kids?

1057
01:23:42,031 --> 01:23:45,534
And we'd be playing ball and
the ball would get stuck up in a tree?

1058
01:23:45,534 --> 01:23:48,829
- And we'd yell "Do over!" Huh?
- Yeah.

1059
01:23:49,288 --> 01:23:53,375
Your life is a "do over".
You got a clean slate.

1060
01:23:54,627 --> 01:23:56,712
I got no place to live.

1061
01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:01,467
I'm gonna get wiped out in the divorce
cos I committed adultery.

1062
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:05,346
So I may never even see my kids again.

1063
01:24:06,347 --> 01:24:07,890
I'm alone.

1064
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:13,228
How's that slate look now?

1065
01:24:15,356 --> 01:24:17,483
Well, the fun continues.

1066
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,985
- They're gone.
- Who?

1067
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:22,404
Jeff and TR.
They skedaddled.

1068
01:24:23,947 --> 01:24:26,784
They jumped on their horses and took off.

1069
01:24:26,825 --> 01:24:29,328
They probably thought
we'd get'em in trouble.

1070
01:24:29,328 --> 01:24:32,456
Does anybody know
how to get where we're going?

1071
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:37,836
- So we're talking death?
- Won't Ben and Steve send some help?

1072
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:42,049
Maybe they won't. When they left,
we were still pretty much OK.

1073
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:44,885
- Still, they might.
- "Might"?

1074
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,513
We're hanging our lives on "might"?

1075
01:24:47,513 --> 01:24:51,558
Let's not get hysterical, OK?
Calm down.

1076
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:55,396
Now, for four days,
we've been going in this direction.

1077
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:59,066
- I think we keep going in that direction.
- Isn't that a little vague?

1078
01:24:59,066 --> 01:25:04,029
Curly said there was a river and a valley.
We'll just have to do the best we can.

1079
01:25:04,071 --> 01:25:06,115
So you're saying we can drive this herd?

1080
01:25:06,115 --> 01:25:08,242
Herd?
Are you delirious?

1081
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:13,247
We leave the herd.
We'll go ten times as fast without them.

1082
01:25:14,123 --> 01:25:17,126
But there's no pasture land up here.
There's no water.

1083
01:25:17,126 --> 01:25:19,670
I don't think they can survive up here.

1084
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:22,840
Not to sound cold-hearted,
but so-the-hell-what?

1085
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:27,594
They give us a trail boss with
a coronary and a bunch of drunks...

1086
01:25:27,594 --> 01:25:30,097
...and we're supposed
to worry about the cattle?

1087
01:25:30,097 --> 01:25:33,517
- You're a nicer person than I am.
- No, you're right.

1088
01:25:34,518 --> 01:25:37,271
The rest of you go ahead.
I'll drive the herd.

1089
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:40,858
- What are you talking about?
- I think I can bring in the herd.

1090
01:25:40,858 --> 01:25:43,444
No, you can't.
What are you, crazy?

1091
01:25:43,569 --> 01:25:46,655
You couldn't even manage your stores.
You had to bring in your cousin.

1092
01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:50,075
Mitch, you were right about
all the weekend warrior shit.

1093
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:53,495
The war games, the parachuting.
That was all bullshit.

1094
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:55,622
But this is really happening.

1095
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:58,876
No rules, no games.
Just "Can I do it?"

1096
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:03,005
It is a game. It's your regular
game, Ed. Don't you see it?

1097
01:26:03,005 --> 01:26:06,258
"Am I better than my father"?
Well, you are, OK?

1098
01:26:06,383 --> 01:26:09,428
- Look, I need to do this.
- It's impossible.

1099
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:11,930
I'll do it with you.

1100
01:26:13,307 --> 01:26:18,020
Phil. Phil, you have, like,
a day's worth of food and water left.

1101
01:26:18,312 --> 01:26:20,606
- We'll be all right.
- Maybe you won't.

1102
01:26:20,606 --> 01:26:24,109
Why don't you accept that you
don't know what we're going through?

1103
01:26:24,109 --> 01:26:26,612
I know exactly what you're going through.

1104
01:26:26,612 --> 01:26:31,533
You think bringing in this herd is gonna
repair all the broken pieces of your life come together?

1105
01:26:31,533 --> 01:26:34,536
Hey, you don't wanna do it,
don't do it. We wanna do it.

1106
01:26:34,536 --> 01:26:37,706
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't do it. I'm not asking you to do it.

1107
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:42,336
You have been talking me into doing stuff
like this all my life, and I am not doing it!

1108
01:26:42,336 --> 01:26:45,339
What, are you deaf?
I'm not asking you to do it.

1109
01:26:45,339 --> 01:26:46,715
Great!

1110
01:26:47,925 --> 01:26:49,635
Come on, Phil.

1111
01:26:54,264 --> 01:26:55,849
It's crazy.

1112
01:27:19,289 --> 01:27:24,044
We'll ride out together tomorrow
morning... without the herd.

1113
01:27:26,213 --> 01:27:28,632
They can do whatever they want.

1114
01:27:47,067 --> 01:27:50,029
Come on.
We've got cattle to move.

1115
01:27:54,074 --> 01:27:57,077
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

1116
01:27:57,328 --> 01:28:00,331
I'm not listening to you.
Goddamn cattle drive.

1117
01:28:00,331 --> 01:28:03,292
- Just do your job.
- I'm not listening to you any more.

1118
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:06,795
- Listen to the cows.
- Come on, you damn little dogies.

1119
01:28:07,129 --> 01:28:09,882
Hey, stop that!
Cut that out!

1120
01:28:10,049 --> 01:28:13,761
- What are you doing?
- They're not cooperating. It's just like bringin' up my kids.

1121
01:28:13,969 --> 01:28:17,306
- You take those. I'll take these.
- Hey, come back here.

1122
01:28:18,349 --> 01:28:20,267
Hey! Stop!
Stop it!

1123
01:28:21,477 --> 01:28:23,437
Stop!
Get back here!

1124
01:28:24,104 --> 01:28:27,149
Ah, the hell with you.
Who needs you, anyway?

1125
01:28:33,155 --> 01:28:34,907
What the he...?

1126
01:28:35,658 --> 01:28:37,534
How did I do that?

1127
01:28:41,163 --> 01:28:42,748
Hey, Mitch!

1128
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:49,964
It's Mitch!
Mitchy the Kid!

1129
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:54,259
Curly said there's nothing
like bringing in a herd.

1130
01:29:06,063 --> 01:29:07,940
Nice hat, partner.

1131
01:29:10,442 --> 01:29:11,443
Come on.

1132
01:29:11,443 --> 01:29:13,696
Hey, there's my little man.

1133
01:29:13,696 --> 01:29:17,449
Sorry I was late, but there was
so much traffic. Let's go. Ha!

1134
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:25,916
Don't be ashamed.
I had the same problem.

1135
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:28,419
Didn't you feel stupid?
I mean...

1136
01:29:28,919 --> 01:29:31,297
Didn't you feel... inadequate?

1137
01:29:31,422 --> 01:29:34,300
Yeah, for a while.
But then I overcame it.

1138
01:29:34,925 --> 01:29:38,429
Can I explain it you again?
Promise me you won't get upset.

1139
01:29:38,429 --> 01:29:40,848
OK.
It's not gonna do any good.

1140
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:46,770
OK. If you wanna watch one show, but
record another show at the same time...

1141
01:29:46,937 --> 01:29:49,440
...the TV does not have
to be on channel three.

1142
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,941
- It does.
- It doesn't.

1143
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:54,445
If you're watching what you're
recording, it has to be on three.

1144
01:29:54,445 --> 01:29:57,031
- The TV or the machine?
- The TV.

1145
01:29:57,448 --> 01:29:59,575
I can record something
I'm not watching?

1146
01:29:59,575 --> 01:30:03,078
Yes, that's the point.
You don't even need a TV to record.

1147
01:30:03,078 --> 01:30:05,581
- How would I see it?
- To see it, you need a TV.

1148
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:08,459
Shut up. Just shut up.
He doesn't get it!

1149
01:30:09,043 --> 01:30:13,839
He'll never get it. It's been four hours.
The cows can tape something by now.

1150
01:30:14,048 --> 01:30:16,175
Forget about it, please!

1151
01:30:18,427 --> 01:30:21,889
- How do you do the clock?
- You're dead. You are dead!

1152
01:30:44,703 --> 01:30:46,413
Yah! Yah!
Yah!

1153
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:49,792
Let's go. Come on, Norman.
Keep up.

1154
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:53,629
Norman, stay with the class.
Come on, boy.

1155
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:55,923
Aw, shit.

1156
01:30:56,423 --> 01:30:59,343
- What do we do now?
- Like I should know?

1157
01:30:59,343 --> 01:31:02,930
- Come on, let's keep the herd together.
- Yeah, let's go.

1158
01:31:03,347 --> 01:31:07,059
Let's go, Norman. Norman,
what are you? Gene Kelly? Let's go.

1159
01:31:21,365 --> 01:31:23,617
Easy, boy.
Whoa! Easy, boy.

1160
01:31:25,244 --> 01:31:26,996
Go!
Go, go, go!

1161
01:31:37,715 --> 01:31:40,217
We're doing great guys.
We're driving'em.

1162
01:31:40,217 --> 01:31:43,679
That's perfect. We're lost,
but we're making good time.

1163
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:46,390
This is the way, guys.
I can feel it.

1164
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:06,744
- Is there a way around?
- That could be a hundred miles.

1165
01:32:06,744 --> 01:32:09,872
- It could take days.
- Is this supposed to be here?

1166
01:32:09,872 --> 01:32:13,334
There's probably an easy place
to cross but we missed it.

1167
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:16,253
- This could be the easy place!
- Oh, God.

1168
01:32:17,129 --> 01:32:21,842
We did the best we could. Let's just leave
the herd and get the hell outta here, huh?

1169
01:32:22,217 --> 01:32:24,845
No.
A cowboy doesn't leave his herd.

1170
01:32:25,763 --> 01:32:28,307
You are a sporting-goods salesman!

1171
01:32:31,143 --> 01:32:32,686
Not today.

1172
01:32:38,442 --> 01:32:40,027
Easy... OK.

1173
01:32:41,862 --> 01:32:44,740
I started this...
and I'm gonna finish it.

1174
01:32:45,783 --> 01:32:47,743
I'm gonna finish it.

1175
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:58,170
It's fast, but it's not deep.
Come on, bring'em down.

1176
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:01,715
Come on!
Let's go!

1177
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,099
Oh, God.

1178
01:33:34,123 --> 01:33:36,208
Come on, move!
Move it!

1179
01:33:44,216 --> 01:33:46,260
Move it, now.
Come on.

1180
01:33:48,095 --> 01:33:49,430
Whoa!

1181
01:33:51,557 --> 01:33:52,891
Shit.

1182
01:34:08,365 --> 01:34:12,286
Come on, boys! Come on, now.
Move it! Moo cow!

1183
01:34:12,661 --> 01:34:14,580
Go, baby!
Go, baby!

1184
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:18,751
Hey, Phil. I'm 39 and
I'm saying "moo cow" in a river.

1185
01:34:19,627 --> 01:34:21,587
Do you believe this?

1186
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:24,089
- We did it!
- Hey!

1187
01:34:39,897 --> 01:34:41,190
Yah!

1188
01:34:45,361 --> 01:34:46,945
Here we go!

1189
01:34:52,326 --> 01:34:53,744
Norman!

1190
01:34:55,454 --> 01:34:56,914
Oh, God.

1191
01:35:31,949 --> 01:35:33,283
Whoa!

1192
01:35:43,043 --> 01:35:44,461
Norman!

1193
01:35:46,964 --> 01:35:48,382
Norman!

1194
01:35:51,135 --> 01:35:52,886
Norman!
Norman!

1195
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:55,848
Norman!

1196
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:01,520
Got you.
Help!

1197
01:36:02,813 --> 01:36:04,690
Oh, my God.
Mitch!

1198
01:36:04,732 --> 01:36:07,359
- Hey, Ed!
- Help! Help me!

1199
01:36:10,654 --> 01:36:12,072
Oh, no.

1200
01:36:17,244 --> 01:36:18,620
Mitch!

1201
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:38,641
Oh, shit.

1202
01:37:12,466 --> 01:37:14,051
I'm coming!

1203
01:37:14,969 --> 01:37:16,553
I'm coming!

1204
01:37:24,269 --> 01:37:26,105
Come on!
Come on!

1205
01:37:26,855 --> 01:37:28,691
Come on!
Come on!

1206
01:37:45,958 --> 01:37:48,460
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.

1207
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:59,888
You're crazy. You talk about me,
but you're crazy.

1208
01:38:01,473 --> 01:38:04,810
- You coulda been killed!
- We almost lost you, pal.

1209
01:38:14,111 --> 01:38:15,696
Nice catch.

1210
01:38:17,614 --> 01:38:20,451
It was like Mays in the '54 World Series.

1211
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:23,620
- Vic Wertz.
- Vic Wertz.

1212
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:42,992
- Let's bring'em in.
- Yee-ha!

1213
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:55,337
Great gobs of gooseshit!

1214
01:39:56,422 --> 01:39:58,382
It's them!
Ira! Ira!

1215
01:40:26,452 --> 01:40:28,078
Yahoo!

1216
01:40:49,975 --> 01:40:51,310
Whoo!

1217
01:41:02,404 --> 01:41:04,073
Whoo!
Yee-ha!

1218
01:41:12,164 --> 01:41:13,540
Yahoo!

1219
01:41:15,501 --> 01:41:16,877
Yahoo!

1220
01:41:22,091 --> 01:41:23,884
Way to go, guys.

1221
01:41:26,387 --> 01:41:28,013
- Hi.
- Hi.

1222
01:41:35,187 --> 01:41:37,022
Oh, Lordy, Lordy.

1223
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:45,197
- Here's your herd.
- I'm as happy as a puppy with two peters.

1224
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:48,200
We had a search party out lookin' for you.

1225
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,286
- They didn't find us.
- Un-by-God-believable.

1226
01:41:52,204 --> 01:41:54,873
Bunch o' tenderfeet
bringin' in a herd.

1227
01:41:54,873 --> 01:41:58,419
Two weeks ago, you boys were as
worthless as henshit on a pump handle.

1228
01:41:58,419 --> 01:42:00,212
Look at you now!

1229
01:42:00,337 --> 01:42:03,257
- I'm givin' your money back!

1230
01:42:04,133 --> 01:42:06,302
Now you're talking, Clay.

1231
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:10,723
Instead of the money, you think
my dad and I could come back and...

1232
01:42:10,764 --> 01:42:13,767
...take the cattle back to New Mexico?
- Really, son?

1233
01:42:13,767 --> 01:42:17,438
Ordinarily, that'd be great,
but this herd's not goin' back.

1234
01:42:18,105 --> 01:42:19,106
What do you mean?

1235
01:42:19,106 --> 01:42:22,151
I'm gettin' top dollar
from the meat company.

1236
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:27,031
- You mean these cows are...
- I thought you just moved'em around?

1237
01:42:27,031 --> 01:42:30,701
Usually do, but prices are
sky high, and I can't pass it up.

1238
01:42:36,582 --> 01:42:40,294
Look, folks, it's not like
any of'em have a lot to live for.

1239
01:42:40,794 --> 01:42:42,796
They don't have much of a life, anyway.

1240
01:42:42,796 --> 01:42:46,300
- Phil doesn't, but we wouldn't eat him.
- That's right.

1241
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:50,262
This is our business, son.
This is not an endangered species.

1242
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:54,183
It's what these animals are bred for.

1243
01:42:54,183 --> 01:42:58,604
All that meat under Cellophane in the
store, where do you think it comes from?

1244
01:42:58,937 --> 01:43:01,231
Come on, fellas.
Just relax.

1245
01:43:01,357 --> 01:43:03,400
You done real good, cowboys.

1246
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,361
Let's get some grub.

1247
01:43:22,503 --> 01:43:24,546
These cows trusted us.

1248
01:43:25,297 --> 01:43:28,175
They trusted us?
They don't even know us!

1249
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:31,762
They followed us
because we yelled "Yah".

1250
01:43:31,804 --> 01:43:33,555
They're cattle.

1251
01:44:25,858 --> 01:44:27,192
What?

1252
01:45:05,272 --> 01:45:08,025
I've gotta stop bein' a schmuck.

1253
01:45:08,317 --> 01:45:10,736
You know, you were right, Mitch.

1254
01:45:10,736 --> 01:45:14,031
My life is a "do over".
It's time to get started.

1255
01:45:17,326 --> 01:45:19,203
I hope I can help.

1256
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:23,290
I'm gonna go home...

1257
01:45:23,832 --> 01:45:25,834
...and I'm gonna get Kim pregnant.

1258
01:45:25,834 --> 01:45:29,296
- I hope I can help.
- Oh, Mitchy the Kid's in trouble.

1259
01:45:32,967 --> 01:45:35,094
- What about you?
- Hm?

1260
01:45:35,469 --> 01:45:38,806
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. Cos I know what he meant.

1261
01:45:39,473 --> 01:45:42,142
- Who?
- Curly. I know what this is.

1262
01:45:42,977 --> 01:45:45,479
- What?
- That's what you have to figure out.

1263
01:45:45,479 --> 01:45:47,982
- I'm gonna deck you, pal.
- No, that's what it is.

1264
01:45:47,982 --> 01:45:51,485
It's different for everybody.
It's whatever's most important to you.

1265
01:45:51,485 --> 01:45:55,531
For me, when I was in the river,
I was only thinkin' about one thing.

1266
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:58,617
All that other stuff just went away.

1267
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:01,662
Only one thing really mattered to me.

1268
01:46:02,496 --> 01:46:04,832
- Dad!
- Daddy, you're home!

1269
01:46:09,586 --> 01:46:11,171
I love you.

1270
01:46:12,589 --> 01:46:14,591
These faces.
I missed these faces.

1271
01:46:14,591 --> 01:46:18,012
- We missed you too, Daddy.
- It's no fun without you.

1272
01:46:18,595 --> 01:46:20,347
Hey, buckaroos.

1273
01:46:22,099 --> 01:46:24,518
- Next year, the North Pole.
- What?

1274
01:46:24,518 --> 01:46:27,938
We hire dog sleds and follow
the same route as Admiral Byrd.

1275
01:46:27,938 --> 01:46:29,148
Uh-huh.

1276
01:46:29,148 --> 01:46:31,525
Next Tuesday, coffee and cake.

1277
01:46:32,568 --> 01:46:33,485
Better.

1278
01:46:33,485 --> 01:46:35,029
Come here.

1279
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:41,535
Hey, Phil!
You need a ride?

1280
01:46:41,535 --> 01:46:43,662
No, thanks.
I got a cab.

1281
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:02,097
- So, how are you?
- Good. Things are good.

1282
01:47:04,099 --> 01:47:05,976
Look what I found.

1283
01:47:07,436 --> 01:47:09,813
Mm, that's nice.
Where was it?

1284
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:14,693
Colorado. I mean, it's always
the last place you look.

1285
01:47:16,528 --> 01:47:18,739
Mitch, I've been thinking.

1286
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:22,534
If you really hate your job,
why don't you get out of there?

1287
01:47:22,534 --> 01:47:25,954
- We'll be all right.
- No. I'm not gonna quit my job.

1288
01:47:27,081 --> 01:47:30,751
I'm just gonna do it better.
I'm gonna do everything better.

1289
01:47:31,627 --> 01:47:33,212
Everything?

1290
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:50,813
See?

1291
01:47:51,814 --> 01:47:54,650
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

1292
01:47:55,818 --> 01:47:57,319
Let's go home.

1293
01:47:57,319 --> 01:48:00,698
Today... is my best day.

1294
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:07,705
Mr Robbins?

1295
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,416
Yeah, right here.

1296
01:48:11,667 --> 01:48:13,377
This is great.

1297
01:48:14,878 --> 01:48:17,089
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1298
01:48:17,381 --> 01:48:20,342
- What, did you get a dog?
- We got a dog?!

1299
01:48:20,342 --> 01:48:22,970
- All right!
- Come on, little man.

1300
01:48:26,265 --> 01:48:28,434
Everyone, this is Norman.

1301
01:48:31,145 --> 01:48:33,230
- It's a cow.
- Uh-uh.

1302
01:48:33,605 --> 01:48:35,607
He's a calf, actually.

1303
01:48:35,607 --> 01:48:38,360
Mitch!
You're gonna put him in the van?

1304
01:48:39,945 --> 01:48:41,864
Oh, yeah.
And then the den.

1305
01:48:41,864 --> 01:48:45,951
- You're not gonna take him home.
- See, kids, he just said "Hello".

1306
01:48:46,869 --> 01:48:50,372
Just for a little while.
Then we'll put him in a petting zoo...

1307
01:48:50,372 --> 01:48:53,334
...so he can be with your mother.
- Mitch!

1308
01:48:54,877 --> 01:48:57,254
I'm kidding!
I'm just kidding.

1309
01:49:03,385 --> 01:49:06,472
- OK, seat belts, Norman. Seat belts.
- Mitch!

1310
01:49:06,889 --> 01:49:10,225
I hope you went to the bathroom.
We got a long ride.

1311
01:49:10,392 --> 01:49:12,603
- Mitch!
- Let's go home.
