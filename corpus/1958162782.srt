00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:46,002
Bullshit. You can't keep
a straight anything.

174
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,352
Here, I'm tired of tending bar.

175
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,093
Freshen my drink, you fruit.

176
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,312
I ever tell you about
the time I was stuck

177
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:54,967
out on the Elsenborn
Ridge, and the only way

178
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,885
I could keep my lap warm was
by spooning Orville Ketcham,

179
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,974
- that Tommy from London?
- Vaguely.

180
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,237
Say what you want
about the Tommies,

181
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:07,241
but they've got some warm rumps.

182
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:08,502
[chuckling] Okay.

183
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,290
Hard to believe
that was a year ago.

184
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:18,165
I, I wanna thank you
all for being here.

185
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:22,648
It's been a hard start to
the winter without Susie.

186
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:25,912
- To Susan.
- Hear, hear.

187
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,522
- To Susan.
- To Susie.

188
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,134
Ah, Susie.

189
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:34,791
[sad music]

190
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,162
Well, it helps having you here.

191
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,233
I never thought I'd spend
a Christmas without her.

192
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:44,452
None of us did, Hock.

193
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:51,198
It's been six weeks now
since she... checked out.

194
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,247
I've been doing a lot
of reading, you know,

195
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:01,208
to pass the time and
keep the wits about me.

196
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,344
Started with
psychology, you know,

197
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,564
thinking I could figure out
why she did what she did.

198
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,307
But then I switched
to metaphysics.

199
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,309
You ever heard that
word? I hadn't.

200
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:23,143
Yeah, it's ghosts and
hokum. Weird nonsense.

201
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,234
You know, just to keep hopeful.

202
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,366
- Hopeful?
- Yeah.

203
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,239
Stories of, o-of fellas
that can talk to the dead:

204
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:37,549
mediums... clairvoyants...
spirit guides.

205
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,986
Grifters. During the Great
War, my no-good uncle

206
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,728
charged folks a buffalo nickel

207
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,600
to give them messages
from their dead kids.

208
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:48,168
They just wanna feel like
something else is out there.

209
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:50,604
They're scared.

210
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,955
It's all hooey.

211
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:57,611
Ah well you know, but
outta every hundred cases

212
00:10:57,612 --> 00:11:01,486
that they debunk, all that
hooey, one or two check out.

213
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,835
I mean, they got a whole society

214
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,664
that keeps tabs on it in the UK.

215
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,276
Come on Hock. Now I've known you

216
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,061
since we were eight years old.

217
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,543
You used to laugh at people
who bought into this malarkey.

218
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,896
Well, I'm not saying
that I believe it.

219
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:26,990
But listen... you're all
here tonight and that's...

220
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:28,948
that's very special.

221
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,953
And I'm just wondering
if you would humor me.

222
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:40,046
<i>♪ He's harmless with his
woo, it's only in his eyes ♪</i>

223
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:45,748
Now, you probably all
think it's a load of bunk.

224
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,969
But, uh... this séance thing,

225
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:53,059
there's a lot of
corroborating evidence.

226
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,629
Hock, I...

227
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,334
Colonel, I know it's been
rough since Thanksgiving,

228
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,772
but this is not the answer.

229
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,867
So this, this is
just... it's silly.

230
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:26,092
Sure, well maybe
just for a laugh.

231
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,702
A laugh, Hock?

232
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,401
This isn't funny.

233
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:43,065
Listen, you can
all roll your eyes

234
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,024
until they snap off
inside your head.

235
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,897
But I started going to church

236
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:54,338
three days a week
after Susie... left.

237
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,296
I was looking for answers.

238
00:12:57,297 --> 00:13:00,126
You know, why she
did what she did.

239
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,088
And afterwards, every
time I would sit down

240
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:08,351
with the reverend
and he would tell me

241
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,788
all about the afterlife.

242
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:14,400
He would go on and on
about the glory of heaven

243
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:16,881
and the fires of hell.

244
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:18,666
He told me all about redemption,

245
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:25,412
and all the babies in purgatory,
and everything in between.

246
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,461
And after going to
mass for four weeks,

247
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:34,987
like some sort of
brainwashed schmuck,

248
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,120
that holier-than-thou son
of a bitch had the nerve

249
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,733
to say that what Susie
did was unforgivable.

250
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:48,305
That my wife, a good
church-going patriot,

251
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,659
was damned to hell
because of what she did?!

252
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,765
I mean, do you know why
she did what she did?!

253
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,275
It was because of
the Krauts next door!

254
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:07,019
She knew they were
spying for the Nazis!

255
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,199
And I didn't believe
her. Nobody did.

256
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,159
And she couldn't take that.

257
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,422
She couldn't take
that her friends

258
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,600
and her family
didn't believe her.

259
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:25,254
But what was she gonna do?

260
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:28,867
She put it in the reports,
and no one was listening.

261
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,044
And then on
Thanksgiving morning,

262
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,265
right before I went out
for a pack of Raleighs,

263
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,527
she said it again.

264
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,574
She said they were
moving in on her,

265
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,837
that they knew that she knew.

266
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,842
And I, I jus-I, I laughed.

267
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,106
I just, I laughed at her.

268
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:55,372
And then when I came
back, she was just all...

269
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:01,899
and that priest, he
had the nerve to say

270
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,728
that she was damned to hell.

271
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,470
Well, I just walked out.

272
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:12,475
I mean, I gave up, quit
believing in any of it.

273
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,434
I decided right there and then

274
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,654
that if Susie was
damned to hell,

275
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,657
then the whole thing
was fucking bullshit!

276
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:25,141
All of it! When you die,
it's just... just nothing.

277
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:27,360
You're just fucking worm food.

278
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:30,233
And then I started
thinking about that,

279
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:35,803
and that seemed
[gasping] even scarier.

280
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:42,635
So t-t-there's just nothing?
That Susie's just gone,

281
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:45,509
Gone forever because I
didn't listen to her?

282
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,599
- I didn't believe her?
- Hock.

283
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:50,556
[sigh]

284
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,951
Sweetheart, we all miss Susie.

285
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,042
Then please, will you humor me?

286
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,914
I mean, I think it's
abundantly clear

287
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:02,265
that I'm not in a good place.

288
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,051
I've held out as much
hope as any man can.

289
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:11,274
And now I just, I
need you to do this.

290
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,234
I need this. I
need this from you.

291
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:17,367
Here. Now.

292
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:24,200
Sir, we are here for you.

293
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:26,592
But not for this.

294
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,209
I am not comfortable right now.

295
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,994
Meet my friends, we're
never comfortable.

296
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,654
[calming music]

297
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,266
Sit down, Paul.

298
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:51,443
Okay.

299
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:59,061
Don't you just hope after
all this death, the war,

300
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:02,542
all the nightmares... that
there's something else?

301
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:06,068
I already believe Hock,
I don't need to see it.

302
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,419
You remember Jimmy Rogers?

303
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:13,249
That poor kid we tried to staple
back together in Normandy?

304
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:18,253
Don't you just want to
know that he's still

305
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,343
got that smile on his
face out there somewhere?

306
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,085
What about you?

307
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:28,872
Don't you wish you had proof
that all the other fellas

308
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:33,006
at your base, they didn't
just burst into dust and flame

309
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:35,227
when those Kraut bombs
came raining down on them?

310
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:41,799
- And your wife, Clive.
- And my wife.

311
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,018
All right, so where,

312
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,673
where are you keeping
the Ouija board?

313
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,516
Oh, well this is
different, Arch.

314
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,070
See with Ouija, the spirits
speak through the board,

315
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,857
writing messages and
stories and such.

316
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:03,255
But with a séance, the spirits
speak directly through us.

317
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:06,606
All you really need is a mirror,

318
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:12,090
and a couple of friends who
aren't afraid to hold hands.

319
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:15,180
What do you say, Paulie?
Will you hold my hand?

320
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,228
[laughing]

321
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:21,881
I need a scotch.

322
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:24,450
Ah, ah, ah... We're supposed
to have clear minds.

323
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,538
Clear minds, Hock?

324
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,585
You're three fucking
bottles in already.

325
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:31,718
[scoffing] Well, then
we split this one.

326
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,024
[glass slammed onto table]

327
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:49,258
- [lights buzzing]
- [soft uneasy music]

328
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:54,479
So they, they say if
you have something

329
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,830
that belonged to the person
you're trying to contact,

330
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:02,574
that it's a little easier.

331
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,924
Is that Susan's handkerchief?

332
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:06,013
Oh my God, Hock.

333
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,713
- Why'd you hold onto that?
- [handkerchief ripping]

334
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,280
I, I wanna be clear.

335
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,457
I, I believe in the afterlife,
I believe in heaven and hell.

336
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,243
I believe Susie's out there,
but I don't believe in this.

337
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:25,119
- Look, - [necklace clanking]

338
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:32,388
if we can just make
contact with anyone,

339
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:38,829
if we can just confirm that
there's something else.

340
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,048
Whatever, Hock.

341
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,574
Just don't play us
for a bunch of fools.

342
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:47,229
This ain't about
that kid in Normandy,

343
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:51,537
and it ain't about Marla's
fellas at the base.

344
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:56,281
No this, [finger tapping],
this is about Susie.

345
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:01,504
All right. Fine.

346
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,331
[clears throat]

347
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,608
Okay, I don't exactly
know what I'm doing,

348
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,220
but if there are
any spirits here,

349
00:20:24,831 --> 00:20:26,224
we'd love to talk to ya.

350
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,445
How do we, you know...
know if it's working?

351
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,535
If it's gonna work, it'll work.

352
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,492
Okay but Hock, if
it doesn't work,

353
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:35,972
I don't want you
to stop believing

354
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,279
Susie is out there somewhere.

355
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:42,849
Faith is about
what you can't see.

356
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,417
Yeah, well that's where
we're different, darlin'.

357
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,420
I got no faith left.

358
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:55,253
If there are any spirits here...

359
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,822
Make yourselves known.

360
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:05,481
Spirits? Give us a sign.

361
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,571
Anything. Please.

362
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,489
Please! Give us
a sign, anything!

363
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:16,447
Give us a sign.

364
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:22,975
- [door slams loudly]
- Oh my God!

365
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:23,976
What the hell was that?

366
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,676
Hey, don't let go.

367
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,895
- You can't break the circle.
- What?

368
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:32,595
We have to end the séance
before we break the circle.

369
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,467
Otherwise, the door to the
other side remains open.

370
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,644
And how exactly do you close
the door to the other side?

371
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:41,865
Because I vote for that.

372
00:21:42,387 --> 00:21:43,780
[door slams loudly]

373
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:45,912
What the hell is that?

374
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:48,566
Come on, Hock. Did you lock
your cat in the closet again?

375
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,048
- [door thuds]
- Nobody gets up!

376
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,050
Give us a sign!

377
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,746
That wasn't good enough for you?

378
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,749
It sure as hell wasn't
good enough for me.

379
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,011
You're gonna have to do a
lot better than that, ghosts!

380
00:21:59,012 --> 00:21:59,970
[door slams]

381
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:02,102
All right, everyone just focus!

382
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,103
Focus?! Focus on what?

383
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:06,890
On the closet that none of
us are allowed to check out?

384
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:10,459
Now you listen to me, Colonel.

385
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:13,636
I'm here for you... all the way.

386
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:19,119
But this, this isn't
gonna fix anything.

387
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,644
Now, if you want to know
if there's something

388
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:24,602
on the other side, that's fine.

389
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:27,083
But you're gonna have to
dig a hell of a lot deeper

390
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,216
than some kind of parlor
trick or something,

391
00:22:29,608 --> 00:22:31,217

You ever heard of candles
that light themselves on cue?

401

I don't know, but I'd
buy that more than...

404

- Or maybe don't.
- Come in.

410
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,767
Look into the mirror.

411
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:28,074
Marla, focus on the
mirror, do you see her?

412
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,860
- I want to.
- [door clattering]

413
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:34,516
- Again with the closet.
- Forget the closet.

414

You know I don't, I don't think
we should do this anymore.

415

- I'm gonna...
- Don't you dare get up.

I'm looking for
Susan Hockstatter!

Is anyone listening?

419
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:51,054
She has brown hair
and brown eyes,

420
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,667
and she cut her wrists
on Thanksgiving morning.

421
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,541
This is her locket, this
is her handkerchief.

422
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:02,455
And I miss her more than
any man could ever miss...

423
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:03,632

you believe me?

We need to get outta here, Paul.

Some dizzy Kraut is
hiding in Hock's closet.

I'm overreacting, Bob.

she slit her wrists

You speak Kraut, Marla.

Why didn't you come up
here and interrogate her

00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:20,290
when Susie asked you to?

587
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,901
Because Susie was unwell!

588
00:35:23,294 --> 00:35:26,209
Because the Germans lost
the goddam war in May,

589
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,255
and because it's not my job
to interrogate civilians!

her and it killed her.

Of course he would
follow in her footsteps.

also choose hate.

The police show up, they
throw ol' Clive in a body bag,

it after she died.

called here tonight, right?

You will stop talking
to Bob like that.

We need to get out of here,

674

and we need to let the
right people handle it.

Come on, Arch.

677
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:28,251
Why did Hock lock us in
here in the first place?

678
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,819
And why did he store
a Kraut in his closet?

679
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,430
I mean, he's got a basement.

680
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,563
If he really wanted
to keep her a secret,

681
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:38,827
he could have found a much
better place to store her.

682
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,309
No, no... There
was a method here.

683
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:47,749
- He wanted us to find her.
- [Marla scoffs]

684
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,926
There's a reason he
invited his best friend,

his interrogator, and his
trigger man here tonight.

686
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:00,109
He wanted us to
see what he'd done.

687
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,809
He wanted us to finish this.

688
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:08,944
That's why he wanted me
to come here early today.

689
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:10,422
What?

690
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,210
That's what he'd been trying
to tell me all afternoon.

691
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:17,778
- What?
- He wanted me to kill this woman

692
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,520
before y'all even showed up.

693
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:24,133
And right, right before
he popped himself,

694
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,266
he said he needed me to
do something for him,

695
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:30,008
before he would
even let me leave.

696
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:32,793
I don't get it. If he
wanted to kill her,

697
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,099
why didn't he just
do it himself?

698
00:41:35,666 --> 00:41:37,102
Because Hock wasn't a killer.

699
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:42,586
I'm sorry, Colonel Clive
Hockstatter wasn't a killer?

700
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,545
Oh, he had no
problem with killing.

701
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,808
He just couldn't do it himself.

702
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:49,853
He'd freeze up, look
like he was gonna heave.

703
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:53,248
Any time there was blood,
he'd send in someone else

704
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:56,078
to get their hands
red, someone like me.

705
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:59,037
- That's drivel.
- No, it's true.

706
00:42:00,212 --> 00:42:03,563
No, no fellas, all those
stories he regaled to me,

707
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,303
- on and on and...
- Marla.

708
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:06,436
- What?
- That was bunko.

709
00:42:07,568 --> 00:42:09,308
You know how he felt about you.

710
00:42:11,397 --> 00:42:13,557
He would say anything to put
stars in your pretty eyes.

711
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,318
Excuse me... may we
please get back to me?

712
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,450
- Sure.
- Arch, knock it off.

713
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,887
No, I want some straight
dope on why Susie and Hock

714
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:25,281
thought this dame was a Nazi.

715
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:30,199
Because, because I'm
German... Archie?

716
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,810
Because I sound like the enemy.

717
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:37,467
Well, if it looks like a duck
and it quacks like a duck.

718
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,774
It could still be a goose.

719
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:44,256
You know, when we
came to America...

720
00:42:45,388 --> 00:42:46,955
It was for a better life.

721
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:51,699
They told us it was
The Great Melting Pot.

722
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:56,660
A place where every
race, every religion,

723
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,141
every language was welcome.

724
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:04,189
Silver-tongued government
propaganda, all of it.

725
00:43:08,846 --> 00:43:11,414
Hey! That's Hock's booze.

726
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:15,418
<i>Ja</i>? well he owes me one.

727
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:19,117
[Hildegard clears throat]

728
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:23,992
It's easy to create an enemy.

729
00:43:25,471 --> 00:43:29,693
All you need are slanty
eyes, different color skin,

730
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:32,173
or an accent.

731
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,960
But it's always
better if they speak

732
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:38,310
a different tongue, isn't it?

733
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,924
Must be easier to kill someone
when you can't understand

734
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:45,840
their cries for help.
- Shut up.

735
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,233
You've killed a lot of
Germans, haven't you?

736
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:50,671
So what's one more?

737
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,848
But when was the last
time you killed someone

738
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:56,415
who could tell you
their husband's name,

739
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,202
or their children's
favorite radio show?

740
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:01,593
[gun clicks]

741
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,816
I'm not some nameless soldier
shouting fascist nonsense.

742
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:08,339
I'm a green grocer
who came to New York

743
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,168
chasing the American dream.

744
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:17,872
My friends call me Hildy. My
husband's name is Juürgen.

745
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:22,267
My girls go to PS 124.

746
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,531
And we let them
stay up to listen

747
00:44:26,532 --> 00:44:28,099
to "The Charlotte
Greenwood Show".

748
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:33,714
- Goddamn it.
- Are we good?

749
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:39,632
No, I'm not gonna shoot
you, but I don't like you.

750
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,330
I don't like your name,

751
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:44,232
and I don't like you
living in my country.

752
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:49,730
Well, suppose that's
a start, isn't it?

753
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,084
Now, can we please
open the door?

754
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,913
No, we cannot.

755
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:02,829
You know, y'all might
fall for a solid

756
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,268
dog and pony show, but not me.

757
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:12,882
Let's see... when
was the last time

758
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:15,668
I killed someone
who spoke English?

759
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:19,629
Yeah, a year and a
half ago in Salerno.

760
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:25,113
A weasely little Wop
with big brown eyes...

761
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,985
Looked me up and down
half a dozen times

762
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:31,946
before stammering out,
"I l-l-love America."

763
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:36,602
[sips drink and sighs]

764
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,968
I stabbed that little
Dago right in the mouth.

765
00:45:41,129 --> 00:45:42,129
Do you wanna know why?

766
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:45,697
Because given half a chance,

767
00:45:45,698 --> 00:45:48,266
he would've done the
same Goddamn thing to me.

768
00:45:49,267 --> 00:45:52,270
Or maybe he was just
a scared Italian boy,

769
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:54,838
who secretly loved America.

770
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:00,801
Get those words outta your
mouth, you dirty Kraut.

771
00:46:02,454 --> 00:46:03,454
[glass hitting table]

772
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:07,068
You don't get to talk about
my country. Neither did he.

773
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:10,811
This is my country!!!

774
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,769
Land of the free.

775
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:16,077
Pssh! She's a Nazi!

776
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:18,775
You say your last
name's DiFranco?

777
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:20,863
What of it?

778
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:24,041
You boast of killing
Italians, and yet you are one.

779
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,046
She's takin' us for a walk.

780
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:32,397
Jesus. Breathe, DiFranco.

781
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:34,443
After all we've seen
tonight, she knows!

782
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,836
What? What have you seen?

783
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:38,821
You were in the closet,
didn't you hear it?

784
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,448
Well, I, I was drugged.

785
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,320
I-I think I'm still drugged.

786
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,019
- Damn it.
- I heard voices.

787
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:49,675
I heard Clive yelling
and, and a gunshot.

788
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,287
I panicked, I started
kicking harder.

789
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:57,335
There was a... a
séance. [chuckling]

790
00:46:58,946 --> 00:47:00,730
And we connected with, with-

791
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:04,212
Why are you telling
her any of this?

792
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:06,169
It was Susan! She told Clive...

793
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,911
Shut up, Bob.

794
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:11,480
What are you trying to
accomplish here Paul, huh?

795
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:14,961
Open the Goddamn door!

796
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:17,572
Or what, Marla? You
going to break my finger?

797
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:18,661
Oh, I might.

798
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:20,532
Why don't you just try
and interrogate it open?

799
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:21,532
Okay.

800
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:24,841
She's on the beam,
Paul. Open the door.

801
00:47:25,363 --> 00:47:26,451
Three minutes, Arch.

802
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:30,193
That's how long it's been
since you've had your doubts,

803
00:47:30,194 --> 00:47:32,631
and now you're willing to let
this bitch stroll outta here.

804
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:37,723
Classic. Right when I
need you, you turn faggot.

805
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:40,551
Excuse me?

806
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:43,946
You know what I mean.

807
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:46,557
Yeah, I do. But I'm gonna
pretend like I don't

808
00:47:46,558 --> 00:47:48,342
and we're still being
cordial to one another.

809
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:49,517
Oh, for God's sake.

810
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:51,172
If you've got a problem
Major, speak up.

811
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,087
But it'd better be
about Brownshirts,

812
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:55,872
and not wearing I'm
dippin' my dick.

813
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:58,331
We're on the same team, Paulie.

814
00:48:00,659 --> 00:48:04,881
Thanks for the
reminder... Baby Butcher.

815
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,624
- [tense ominous music]
- What does that mean?

816
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:10,233
Nothin'.

817
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:12,889
What does that mean, Paul?

818
00:48:14,586 --> 00:48:15,586
Well...

819
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:21,202
it might mean, that Archie here,

820
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,726
asked me to stand
before the grand jury

821
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:26,119
and tell them that I did not see

822
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,296
what I definitely
saw back in Berlin.

823
00:48:30,428 --> 00:48:31,473
All to protect my friend,

824
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,042
and the reputation of
this great country.

825
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,653
I knew it. Dammit,
I knew you did it.

826
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:40,438
- Shut up.
- Archie?

827
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:45,966
Paul... he did it?

828
00:48:46,705 --> 00:48:49,447
[soft uneasy music]

829
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:52,449
You did it?

830
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:55,105
Archie was right, Marla.

831
00:48:57,194 --> 00:48:59,849
You've never had two dozen
Nazis charging at you.

832
00:49:01,285 --> 00:49:03,287
He's not being tried
for killing Nazis, Paul.

833
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:08,292
He's being tried for
killing children.

834
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,251
[soft ominous music]

835
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:14,081
You're Archibald Stanton,
from the news radio?

836
00:49:15,908 --> 00:49:17,910
The Berlin Butcher?

837
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:22,350
You said the kid who who
did it was, was dead.

838
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:24,655
Surprise.

839
00:49:27,485 --> 00:49:28,660
Oh, I'm going to be sick.

840
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,011
Don't be so dramatic, Marla.

841
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,273
You're starting to
sound like Hock.

842
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:34,274
Shut up.

843
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,885
I told you he did it.

844
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:41,238
You wanna know what
happened, Marla? Huh?

845
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:46,722
We were being picked off
by two Nazi sharpshooters.

846
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:52,032
One by one, kid after
screaming all-American kid.

847
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:54,034
Hock knew we had to
take that rooftop.

848
00:49:56,297 --> 00:50:00,257
So he told Archie that
if he led the charge

849
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:04,044
and saved even one more of
our boys from sniper fire,

850
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,134
he'd have a hero's
welcome when he got home.

851
00:50:07,873 --> 00:50:09,092
He said he was my Colonel,

852
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,963
and that if anything went wrong,

853
00:50:11,964 --> 00:50:13,401
he would take responsibility.

854
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:15,228
I didn't think about it.

855
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:17,752
In war, you don't
have time to think.

856
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:19,797
You look at the faces of the
men you've sworn to save,

857
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:21,061
and you race into hell.

858
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:23,005
And I... I ran straight
for that building,

859
00:50:24,194 --> 00:50:26,021
praying that if one of
the countless bullets

860
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,242
I heard whizzing past
my ears actually hit me,

861
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:32,897
that it'd be over quick,
and I wouldn't be left

862
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:34,465
flopping around on the road.

863
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:37,250
And I pressed against that wall.

864
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:38,381
Oh God...

865
00:50:38,382 --> 00:50:40,080
Broke the first
window I came to and,

866
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,649
tossed a belt of pineapples
into that building.

867
00:50:45,911 --> 00:50:49,089
It wasn't until after the
smoke cleared that we saw...

868
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:51,569
It was a kindergarten center.

869
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:54,398
I've been reading
about this for weeks.

870
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,575
It was a children's shelter.

871
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,273
War isn't fair, Kraut.

872
00:51:00,187 --> 00:51:02,144
I followed my orders
to the letter,

873
00:51:02,145 --> 00:51:03,973
I did exactly as I was told.

874
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,671
Our boys took the roof,

875
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:10,110
knocked off their snipers
and saved our soldiers.

876
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:15,506
Fifty-six children.

877
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:17,204
[sighs]

878
00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:19,902
You knew they were in there.

879
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:23,123
Everyone knew they
were in there.

880
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:25,081
It was a registered shelter.

881
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:28,171
Hock knew. He just didn't care.

882
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:31,653
God... damn it.

883
00:51:32,262 --> 00:51:34,045
When the press asked,
he made up a story

884
00:51:34,046 --> 00:51:35,874
about a trigger-happy private,

885
00:51:36,397 --> 00:51:38,050
said he was killed in the blast.

886
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:44,187
But people started talking.

887
00:51:45,971 --> 00:51:48,452
Soldiers started putting it
together and I, I got worried,

888
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:50,714
but he said everything
was gonna be okay.

889
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:53,501
He was gonna clear my name
and keep me outta prison,

890
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,721
and that everyone was
going to eat crow.

891
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:03,902
And that people would
stop saying those awful,

892
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:07,732
awful things to my mama every
time she left her house.

893
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:13,260
Well... Clive just blew
his brains out, so...

894
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:23,183
- [dark music]
- I'm a good man.

895
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:27,752
I mean, who, who... who are you?

896
00:52:30,102 --> 00:52:32,061
I mean, what, what kind of man?

897
00:52:32,322 --> 00:52:33,322
You can't say that.

898
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:39,111
You weren't there... It happens.

899
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,375
"It happens"?!

900
00:52:42,506 --> 00:52:44,987
God, all those kids.

901
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:48,250
I mean, what kind
of man, would...

902
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:49,251
[Hildegard] A good one.

903
00:52:50,732 --> 00:52:53,429
In war, good men are tasked
with doing terrible things

904
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,562
every single day.

905
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,434
This does not make
them terrible people.

906
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:00,220
[Paul] And what do
you know about war?

907
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:03,484
I know my family
is still in Berlin.

908
00:53:03,788 --> 00:53:05,790
My nieces and nephews...

909
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:08,409
They could have
been in that school,

910
00:53:09,794 --> 00:53:12,928
but somehow I cannot call
you a monster, Major Stanton.

911
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:17,237
You were fighting
for your country.

912
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,761
You were doing your job.

913
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,677
- [soft ominous music]
- I was... I still am.

914
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,029
I'm not a bad man.

915
00:53:27,812 --> 00:53:30,075
No, none of us are bad.

916
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:33,862
We simply do as, as
we are commanded.

917
00:53:35,472 --> 00:53:38,040
And just who is your Commander?

918
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:42,826
I thought you worked
in a grocery store

919
00:53:42,827 --> 00:53:44,351
with your father-in-law.

920
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,091
<i>Ja</i>, I do.

921
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:48,179
And you call him... Commander?

922
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,704
No, no, I do not
call him Commander.

923
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:54,143
I, I work for him, so
I do as as he commands.

924
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:55,927
Don't play with me, bitch.

925
00:53:57,364 --> 00:53:59,278
I can see your mask slipping

926
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:00,932
every time you open your mouth.

927
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:05,458
I have tried to express to
you that I do not believe

928
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:08,549
a man's singular
actions make him evil.

929
00:54:09,593 --> 00:54:10,941
Especially if that man believes

930
00:54:10,942 --> 00:54:12,683
that what he is doing is moral.

931
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:16,251
I do not believe Major
Stanton to be a bad man,

932
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:18,776
simply because he
was following orders.

933
00:54:19,516 --> 00:54:22,084
Just like I do not believe
you to, to be a bad man,

934
00:54:22,432 --> 00:54:24,478
because you are trying
to protect your friend,

935
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:26,001
and your country.

936
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:29,569
Say it.

937
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:36,011
Some days I can
even try to believe

938
00:54:36,403 --> 00:54:39,274
that my mentally ill
neighbors who were only acting

939
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:42,191
out of a crushing love for
their government and homeland

940
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:45,455
were not bad people.

941
00:54:46,413 --> 00:54:47,413
[Paul] Say it.

942
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:55,247
My name is Hildy Bauman. I
moved to New York in 1931.

943
00:54:57,075 --> 00:54:59,250
My father-in-law owns the
grocery two blocks away.

944
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:02,384
I work there! I live
three doors down from here

945
00:55:02,385 --> 00:55:04,821
with my husband
and my two girls.

946
00:55:04,822 --> 00:55:10,088
- Say it.
- [soft uneasy music]

947
00:55:14,571 --> 00:55:18,358
- I am an American.
- Liar!!!

948
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:22,491
Can we please just open the
door and call the police?

949
00:55:22,492 --> 00:55:24,145
- [radio screeching]
- <i>♪ Is you is or is you ain't ♪</i>

950
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:25,930
- Not again.
- For God's sake.

951
00:55:26,714 --> 00:55:27,714
[radio stops]

952
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:31,936
What are you gonna
do, Paul? Huh?!

953
00:55:32,546 --> 00:55:34,851
Kill her right here in Hock's
brownstone?! Is that...

954
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:36,897
Just open the door, Paul!

955
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:39,247
They're right Major,
open the door.

956
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:40,989
We're losing our
heaven-sent minds.

957
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:42,685
You can't mean that.

958
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:44,252
Please, Major.

959
00:55:48,649 --> 00:55:50,085
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

960
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:56,831
Archie, you are
an American hero.

961
00:55:58,789 --> 00:55:59,789
You're not the kind
of man who lets

962
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,923
a Nazi spy walk out of a room.

963
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:05,927
- Marla.
- What?

964
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:07,754
The Krauts bombed your base.

965
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:09,364
Yeah.

966
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,323
They burnt your pretty body
and left you with a gimp leg.

967
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:14,935
They killed every friend
you had outside this room.

968
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:15,936
I know.

969
00:56:17,765 --> 00:56:19,070
- Bob.
- Yeah?

970
00:56:21,769 --> 00:56:24,162
Well, I don't know tits
about what it is you do.

971
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,296
But somehow I doubt that
the Pentagon would allow

972
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:30,212
a Nazi sympathizer to
push their pencils.

973
00:56:36,523 --> 00:56:38,829
Really? Nobody?

974
00:56:41,571 --> 00:56:46,054
Well in that case Major,
I'll make you a deal.

975
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,365
I give you the key,
you give me the gun.

976
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,975
Absolutely not.

977
00:56:54,976 --> 00:56:56,630
I am not speaking to you, Bob.

978
00:56:57,282 --> 00:57:00,068
I'm sorry Major,
but I can't do that.

979
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:08,468
Well then, I guess
we'd better get cozy.

980
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,687
To hell with you then,
and to hell with this!

981
00:57:11,688 --> 00:57:13,341
Archie, what are you doing?!

982
00:57:13,342 --> 00:57:15,866
[gunshots]

983
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:20,958
[grunting] God damn it!

984
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:25,702
[gasping] I-I don't understand.

985
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:31,665
- Why won't it open?
- [gun blasting]

986
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:35,276
Check the rounds.

987
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:37,887
[gun clicking]

988
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,107
Well, the bullet Clive
used sure worked!

989
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:44,241
Enough! Paul I need
you to take the key

990
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:47,202
out of your pocket and
open the goddam door.

991
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:49,552
This is not up for discussion,

992
00:57:50,074 --> 00:57:52,294
and I don't want to point
a weapon at my friend.

993
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,427
Oh, Archie...

994
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:58,299
Please, Major?

995
00:58:00,171 --> 00:58:03,523
Fine. Fuck all'a ya.

996
00:58:10,138 --> 00:58:14,490
But, if you make
me open this door

997
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,102
and go against everything I am,

998
00:58:20,714 --> 00:58:22,846
I will not take the
stand for you, Archie.

999
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:29,853
Oh, I will stand, before
my God and my country,

1000
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:33,421
and I will tell them
how you spinelessly

1001
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:36,163
blew those toddlers
limb from limb,

1002
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:38,209
just like the
newsmen say you did.

1003
00:58:38,775 --> 00:58:42,518
Hock had me come early
before any of y'all,

1004
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:48,132
to do what he couldn't do,
what, what Susie couldn't do.

1005
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,700
He wanted me to kill this woman.

1006
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,877
And if you make
me open this door,

1007
00:58:54,661 --> 00:58:57,532
I will follow that Nazi
home and beat her to death

1008
00:58:57,533 --> 00:58:58,664
in front of her family.

1009
00:58:58,665 --> 00:59:01,144
- [gun clicking]
- [soft tense music]

1010
00:59:01,145 --> 00:59:02,972
I am not a Nazi.

00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:04,845
- [cane crashing]
- That's it!!!

1012
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:06,934
What's it?

1013
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:08,765
You wanna know if
she's a Nazi, Paul?

1014
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:10,546
Huh? Is that it? You want proof?

1015
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,243
Is that the only way
you're gonna let us out

1016
00:59:12,244 --> 00:59:13,636
of this Goddamn room?

1017
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:15,072
I already know.

1018
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:16,682
You don't know squat.

1019
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:18,858
And if you're not
gonna help, and

1020
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:20,659
if you're just gonna
panic, I'm taking charge.

1021
00:59:23,428 --> 00:59:25,473
If this were my base, I'd
demand all three of you

1022
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:27,997
get out of this room, but
apparently that's not an option.

1023
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:30,653
- So get over there.
- What?

1024
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,176
Go over there, all of you.

1025
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:34,657
What are you doing, Marla?

1026
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:38,139
My job... my shitty job.

1027
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:40,314
Marla. I don't think
that's the best idea.

1028
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:42,273
You know what? I'm
all out of ideas.

1029
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,289
This will confirm it one
way or another, go on.

1030
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:52,152
Go on.

1031
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,461
Sit, Frau Bauman.

1032
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:00,901
Um... why?

1033
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:03,164
Because I told you to.

1034
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:07,081
[soft ominous music]

1035
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:20,660
[cane tapping]

1036
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:28,232
I don't think you're a spy.

1037
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,192
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

1038
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:36,631
We've apparently found
ourselves in a situation

1039
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,198
where you and I
can't leave this room

1040
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:40,201
until we are certain
you're not a Nazi.

1041
01:00:47,164 --> 01:00:48,513
Hold my hand, Hildy.

1042
01:00:52,474 --> 01:00:57,044
[soft ominous music]

1043
01:00:58,132 --> 01:00:59,132
Fuck you, Paul.

1044
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:01,135
What, what is-

1045
01:01:01,439 --> 01:01:02,439
Sh-sh-sh.

1046
01:01:03,485 --> 01:01:07,968
[speaking in German]

1047
01:01:08,446 --> 01:01:09,446
Hmm?

1048
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,840
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:15,192
Stay with me now,
Hildy. Here we go.

1050
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:21,982
You need to listen to me very
closely right now Hildy, hmm?

1051
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:27,074
If you stand up, you'll
be admitting guilt.

1052
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,840
If you attempt to break free,
you'll be admitting guilt.

1053
01:01:31,426 --> 01:01:33,644
You will stay seated
with your hand in mine,

1054
01:01:33,645 --> 01:01:36,126
until I tell you our time
together is complete.

1055
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,171
- But...
- You will answer

1056
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:40,092
every question no matter
how many times I ask it.

1057
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:45,221
And although it
might seem otherwise,

1058
01:01:45,222 --> 01:01:47,137
you and I are alone,
quite alone right now.

1059
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:55,755
Now, what is your full name?

1060
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,235
Um, Hildegard Bauman.

1061
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:02,412
Are you now, or
have you ever been

1062
01:02:02,413 --> 01:02:04,807
a member of the National
Socialist German Workers Party?

1063
01:02:05,982 --> 01:02:07,809
No, the Nazi party
no longer exists.

1064
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:08,855
That's not what I asked.

1065
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,119
No, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm. No.

1066
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:15,557
Who's your primary employer?

1067
01:02:16,123 --> 01:02:17,515
Bergen Street Grocery.

1068
01:02:17,951 --> 01:02:19,300
What's your husband's full name?

1069
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:23,217
- Juürgen Bauman.
- Mm-hmm.

1070
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:29,136
What are your daughter's names?

1071
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:35,229
Robin and Melissa Bauman.

1072
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,276
Why did Susan
Hockstatter believe

1073
01:02:40,277 --> 01:02:42,191
you were a spy for
the German government?

1074
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:43,802
Because she was a sick woman.

1075
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:44,803
Bullshit.

1076
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,180
Did you want me to stop, Paul?

1077
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,375
Why did Susan
Hockstatter believe

1078
01:02:52,376 --> 01:02:54,116
you were a spy for
the German government?

1079
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:56,032
- I told you.
- You will answer.

1080
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:58,555
Oh, no. [gasping]

1081
01:02:58,556 --> 01:03:01,124
All of my questions, no matter
how many times I ask them.

1082
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:04,301
Why did Susan Hockstatter...

1083
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,479
believe you were a spy
for the German government?

1084
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:11,568
Because, because
I have an accent.

1085
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:16,052
Because she needed a
personification of her fears.

1086
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:19,273
Because she wasn't ready
for this war to be over.

1087
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:22,417
And her husband,
Clive Hockstatter?

1088
01:03:23,799 --> 01:03:26,019
He-he didn't believe
her when she was alive.

1089
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:28,847
It was only after she
died that he needed

1090
01:03:28,848 --> 01:03:31,459
a- a target to aim his guilt at.

1091
01:03:32,895 --> 01:03:34,331
I became that target.

1092
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:37,029
You do realize the
Hockstatters were not religious

1093
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,640
or political fanatics, correct?

1094
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:41,469
That they were
high-ranking military,

1095
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:44,080
and upstanding members
of their community?

1096
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:46,909
- <i>Ja</i>.
- Yeah.

1097
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:51,434
But they were sick
people. [screaming]

1098
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:55,091
Hildy! <i>Fraäulein!</i> Are you now,

1099
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,620
or have you ever been a
member of the Nazi party?

1100
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,879
<i>Nein... Nein...</i>

1101
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,272
Are you now or have
you ever been a member

1102
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:05,623
of the National Socialist
German Workers Party?

1103
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:09,888
What? ...No! [screaming]

1104
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:12,238
Are you now, or have
you ever been a member

1105
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:15,329
of the National Socialist
German Workers Party?

1106
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,115
<i>Nein... Nein.</i>

1107
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:22,553
What's your full name?

1108
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:29,691
Hildy... [whimpering]
Hildegard Bauman.

1109
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,650
<i>Verzeíhung.</i>

1110
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:39,353
[Hildegard gasping]

1111
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:45,271
[cane tapping]

1112
01:04:48,884 --> 01:04:50,494
Open the door Paul.
She's not a Nazi.

1113
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:52,975
Open the door!

1114
01:04:57,806 --> 01:04:59,086
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

1115
01:05:00,591 --> 01:05:02,115
Is that all you're
going to do to her?

1116
01:05:02,767 --> 01:05:04,117
You wanna do my
job for me, Paul?

1117
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:07,424
No, but I, I just-

1118
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:09,296
That's all I needed to do, Paul.

1119
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:11,514
I have my answer.

1120
01:05:12,864 --> 01:05:14,517
And if you have any
respect for me whatsoever,

1121
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:16,042
you'll take that
as your answer too.

1122
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:23,788
Earlier you said
um, faith was about

1123
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:27,618
what you couldn't see?
About what you believe?

1124
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:31,840
Well, I know what I believe.

1125
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:33,623
Open the damn door.

1126
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:37,977
[footsteps]

1127
01:05:40,588 --> 01:05:42,328
Marla, you are the finest woman

1128
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:44,026
the US military has ever seen.

1129
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:45,505
I'm not.

1130
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,334
It's such a goddam
shame you ended up

1131
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:50,206
with this pencil neck.

1132
01:05:50,815 --> 01:05:51,815
[Marla scoffs]

1133
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,779
[footsteps]

1134
01:06:00,129 --> 01:06:06,222
- [key clicking]
- [strange, eerie music]

1135
01:06:07,658 --> 01:06:08,658
What the hell?

1136
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:14,229
The, the key it just,
it just disappeared.

1137
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:15,796
Paul, don't you dare.

1138
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,754
The door, the door just ate it.

1139
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:19,626
[Bob] That's a load
of baloney, Paul.

1140
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:20,888
[Marla] What did you do?

1141
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:23,021
I didn't do any, do you
see it on me anywhere?

1142
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:24,544
- Paul!
- Come on.

1143
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:25,675
I didn't do anything.

1144
01:06:25,676 --> 01:06:27,113
Well, somebody
better do something.

1145
01:06:27,939 --> 01:06:29,463
[Clive] Somebody...

1146
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,725
[ominous music]

1147
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:36,600
[Clive breathing]

1148
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:39,908
Somebody is,

1149
01:06:40,691 --> 01:06:44,695
going to do something.

1150
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:48,656
[Hildegard gasping]

1151
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,788
[Clive gasping]

1152
01:06:51,093 --> 01:06:52,813
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, I, what?

1153
01:06:57,621 --> 01:07:02,365
[gasping] Somebody is going to

1154
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,630
kill... that... Nazi.

1155
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:09,110
<i>Leiber Gott!</i>

1156
01:07:09,111 --> 01:07:10,459
- Clive...
- He's dead, right?

1157
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:11,896
- Clive?
- He's very dead.

1158
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:14,334
Well, he doesn't sound dead!

1159
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:17,598
[soft ominous music]

1160
01:07:20,905 --> 01:07:23,256
Major...

1161
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:29,653
No, no, no... This, this
isn't, this isn't right.

1162
01:07:31,002 --> 01:07:34,527
- Help, somebody help!
- Can anyone hear us?!

1163
01:07:34,528 --> 01:07:36,616
Help! Help! Help!

1164
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:38,575
<i>Ich muss hier raus,
verdammt nochmal!</i>

1165
01:07:39,837 --> 01:07:42,535
- Shut up...
- Can anyone help me?!

1166
01:07:42,536 --> 01:07:44,450
Help! Help! Help!

1167
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:47,845
Outta the way!

1168
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:53,546
Shut up... shut up!

1169
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,547
[poker clangs on floor]

1170
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:57,464
Shut up!!!

1171
01:08:04,993 --> 01:08:05,993
Hock?

1172
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:13,654
Oh, what is going
on? [clearing throat]

1173
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:23,142
- Colonel?
- Be careful.

1174
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:26,971
[soft ominous music]

1175
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:36,545
Colonel?

1176
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,509
Kill... her.

1177
01:08:48,123 --> 01:08:49,123
What?

1178
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:55,261
Kill... the... Nazi.

1179
01:08:59,265 --> 01:09:01,180
[heavy breathing]
[clears throat]

1180
01:09:07,316 --> 01:09:08,316
Okay.

1181
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:11,928
No! <i>Nein!</i> No, no, no! Please.

1182
01:09:11,929 --> 01:09:13,931
- No, Paul.
- Please, please.

1183
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:16,281
You heard him.

1184
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:19,588
Oh, this is hell, this room...

1185
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:22,505
[soft ominous music]

1186
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:32,472
And we're locked in it until
one of us offs this Kraut.

1187
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:35,996
There, there must
be another way.

1188
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:38,260
Oh, I pray there isn't.

1189
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:39,783
There has to be.

1190
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:44,092
This, this is why
we are here tonight.

1191
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:47,877
Not for support, not
to save our friend.

1192
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:50,011
He was dead before
we even got here.

1193
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:53,841
Hock needs one of us
to get our hands red.

1194
01:09:54,363 --> 01:09:58,498
Wait... we finish the séance.

1195
01:09:59,977 --> 01:10:01,718
- What?
- Yeah, we, we finish the séance.

1196
01:10:02,153 --> 01:10:03,589
We're, we're still
in another realm.

1197
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:06,244
Hock said if we uncoupled
our hands during the séance,

1198
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:07,549
that the door would stay open.

1199
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:09,464
The door is locked, Marla.

1200
01:10:09,465 --> 01:10:12,251
Not the parlor door! The door
to the other side, you know?

1201
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:15,036
But if we can close that door,

1202
01:10:15,428 --> 01:10:19,519
whatever's keeping us in
here has to go back, correct?

1203
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,346
That's insane.

1204
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:23,826
Our dead friend
says we have to kill

1205
01:10:23,827 --> 01:10:25,785
a Kraut green grocer spy

1206
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:28,266
in order to unlock
his parlor room doors.

1207
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,530
Now that, that right
there is insane.

1208
01:10:32,183 --> 01:10:35,317
Okay, you kinda,
you got a point.

1209
01:10:37,363 --> 01:10:39,103
Give me the gun Archie.
I have to end this.

1210
01:10:40,104 --> 01:10:41,104
No.

1211
01:10:42,933 --> 01:10:46,894
Oh, you're protecting her now?

1212
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:48,895
- Yeah.
- Give me that goddam...

1213
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:50,331
- Paul.
- Oh, I don't believe

1214
01:10:50,332 --> 01:10:51,986
we're even having
this conversation.

1215
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:54,641
I say we try the séance.

1216
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,861
Oh see, baby Bob
agrees with Marla.

1217
01:10:58,471 --> 01:10:59,733
Big whopper of a surprise.

1218
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:01,822
Why don't you cram it, Paul?

1219
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,042
Nobody's gonna be
killing anyone.

1220
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:09,743
We try the séance and
if that doesn't work,

1221
01:11:11,919 --> 01:11:14,529
we try something else,
we just keep trying.

1222
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:15,530
[chair slams]

1223
01:11:19,143 --> 01:11:20,143
Stay here.

1224
01:11:23,365 --> 01:11:27,804
We try it, and if it doesn't
work, I give you the gun.

1225
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,893
What, what? No.

1226
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:33,114
You just stay right there.

1227
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:36,291
I'll be with you in a minute.

1228
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:43,429
Let's hope this works.

1229
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:46,561
Oh, God damn it.

1230
01:11:46,562 --> 01:11:47,682
[chair scrapes across floor]

1231
01:11:50,305 --> 01:11:54,178
But whatever happens,
still killing that Nazi.

1232
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:56,703
- But I...
- Don't.

1233
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:08,148
I don't know what to do.

1234
01:12:10,499 --> 01:12:12,066
Well, neither did he.

1235
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,260
Yeah, and how did that turn out?

1236
01:12:15,504 --> 01:12:18,638
Just tell him to go away.

1237
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:20,727
"Tell him to go away?"

1238
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:24,252
That's pure poetry.

1239
01:12:25,427 --> 01:12:27,211
Uh, this is a message
to the spirit world.

1240
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,215
End this.

1241
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,742
What Hock started,
we're prepared to stop.

1242
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:43,706
- We're through with you.
- [Clive gasping]

1243
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:45,403
Oh god.

1244
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:50,452
Our friend Clive
Hockstatter was hurting

1245
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:53,132
more than any good man should.

1246
01:12:55,326 --> 01:12:57,416
And he wanted answers
to soothe his pain.

1247
01:13:01,332 --> 01:13:04,074
He wanted to know that there
is something else out there,

1248
01:13:05,554 --> 01:13:08,252
and now he knows, we all know.

1249
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:11,168
So now this is over.

1250
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:18,175
It's not over.

1251
01:13:18,915 --> 01:13:21,527
- Shut up, Hock.
- It is over!

1252
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:27,315
This madness is over this
war, this fucking war is over!

1253
01:13:27,924 --> 01:13:30,318
Says who?

1254
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,104
You don't belong here
anymore you, you coward!

1255
01:13:35,323 --> 01:13:36,542
You need to leave us alone!

1256
01:13:37,586 --> 01:13:39,674
You're not gonna drag us
into the dark with you.

1257
01:13:39,675 --> 01:13:43,287
That is my best friend
you're talking to there, Bob.

1258
01:13:43,549 --> 01:13:48,030
Yeah? Well, he was a sad old
bitter knob, just like you!

[Clive gasping]

1260
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:54,647
Hock never liked you Bob,

1261
01:13:55,212 --> 01:13:56,475
and neither did Susie.

1262
01:13:56,823 --> 01:13:58,564
To hell with the both of them!

01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,702
[Bob] Was there a power failure?

1266
01:14:07,703 --> 01:14:08,983
[Archie] What do you think, Bob?

1267
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:15,276
Hock, turn the lights back on.

1268
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,759
[Clive] Go on, Susie.

1269
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:25,199
[candles whooshing]

1270
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:30,596
- You...
- Susie?

1271
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:37,211
- You...
- Oh, <i>Mein Gott</i>.

1272

<i>Gehe weg!</i>

1273
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:44,435
[Susie] You did
this, all of this.

1274
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:48,527
You moved into my neighborhood.

1275
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:54,096
You poisoned my city,
you poisoned me.

1276
01:14:54,097 --> 01:14:56,272
No, stop it.

1277
01:14:56,273 --> 01:14:57,884
[Susie] You killed me.

1278
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:01,713
- You crept into my house.
- What?

1279
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:04,499
- Pinned me down...
- That's a lie.

1280
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:08,937
And slit... my... wrists.

1281
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:12,027
Absolutely not, you crazy bitch!

She's lying! She's mad!
She slit her own wrists!

1285
01:15:22,778 --> 01:15:26,346
Go on, show them how you did it.

1286
01:15:26,347 --> 01:15:29,437
Stop it, stop it!

Did you do it?

1289
01:15:42,798 --> 01:15:43,973
Did you kill Susie?

1290
01:15:45,888 --> 01:15:49,588
No, no... I've, I've,
I've never killed anyone,

1291
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:51,414
let alone a sick woman.

1292
01:15:51,415 --> 01:15:53,808
How about a sick woman
who found you out?

1293
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:58,422
Susie? Hock... let us go.

1294
01:15:59,641 --> 01:16:02,035
[Clive exhaling]

1295
01:16:06,822 --> 01:16:09,825
Hock, stop it.

1296
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:17,137
Stop it.

1297
01:16:19,922 --> 01:16:21,315
Stop it!

1298
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:27,952
We're not gonna kill her, Hock.

1299
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:29,236
Yeah, speak for yourself.

1300
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:31,630
It's not happening, Paulie.

1301
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:35,241
I can't count the
number of times

1302
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:36,809
you made me kill for you, Hock.

1303
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:41,160
You aren't doing it again.

1304
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:42,336
You ain't doing it again!

1305
01:16:43,163 --> 01:16:46,166
- Archie!
- Jesus, please.

1306
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:48,342
Jesus, let me out.

1307
01:16:50,605 --> 01:16:55,696
Send me to prison...
Send me to hell.

1308
01:16:55,697 --> 01:16:57,177
Just let me out. Please.

- What a crock.
- [Hildegard gasping]

1324
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,875
You look away for
one second, Bob,

1325
01:18:29,312 --> 01:18:31,052
I'm ripping that
gun from your hands

1326
01:18:31,053 --> 01:18:32,662
and I'm shoving it
down to her throat.

1327
01:18:32,663 --> 01:18:33,794
No, you're not.

1328
01:18:33,795 --> 01:18:36,450
That snatch killed
Susie and Hock.

1329
01:18:37,973 --> 01:18:39,409
I'm still fighting
this war Marla,

1330
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,239

[Marla] Paul.

1332

I'll take everyone in this

Are you listening
to yourself, huh?!

1334
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:53,771
Have you lost your Goddamn mind?

1335
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,076
We're your best friends!

1336
01:18:55,077 --> 01:18:56,818
Calm down, Major.

1337
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:02,911
I swore an oath to protect
the United States of America.

1338

1340
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:15,663
I'm doing this for Hock and
Susie... just like he ordered.

1341
01:19:17,012 --> 01:19:19,841
[coughing] This is insane.

1342
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:23,236
Shut the fuck up.

1343

- Now... Bob.
- Hmm?

1344
01:19:30,809 --> 01:19:33,159
I'm going to ask one
more time, nicely.

1345
01:19:36,423 --> 01:19:40,296
Will you give me that
God damn gun... please?

1346

No.

1347
01:19:45,345 --> 01:19:47,185
We've clearly reached
the end of our time here.

1348
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:52,700
Paul, I've done terrible things.

1349

You know that, now they
know that, but I am done.

1350
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:02,714
I can't be be a part
of this anymore.

1351
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:08,934
You? You can't be a
part of killing Nazis?

1352
01:20:09,238 --> 01:20:13,808
Killing anyone Paul! That's
not what I signed up for!

1353
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:17,767
Protecting your friends
and family from Nazis

1354
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:19,900
is exactly what
you signed up for!

1355

No, she's not a Nazi.

1356
01:20:22,382 --> 01:20:23,470
The Nazis are gone.

1357
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,300
We're fighting ghosts,
Paul... ghosts like Hock.

1358
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,390
You ruined my goddam life.

1359
01:20:31,782 --> 01:20:34,655
You told me to blow up a
schoolhouse for America.

1360
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:38,050
You told me you'd take
care of me and then you,

you go and shoot yourself.

1362
