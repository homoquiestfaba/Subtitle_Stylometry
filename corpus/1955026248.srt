00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,827
<i>How does one come to
know The Unknowable?

3
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:17,634
<i>What faculties
must a man possess?

4
00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:19,794
<i>Since it was discovered
that whale oil

5
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:23,092
<i>could light our cities in
ways never achieved before,

6
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,426
<i>it created global demand.

7
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:29,240
<i>It had pushed man to
venture further and further

8
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,018
<i>into The Deep, Blue Unknown.

9
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,529
<i>We know not its depths,

10
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,425
<i>nor the host of creatures
that live there.

11
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:41,078
<i>Monsters, are they real?

12
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:56,011
<i>Or do the stories exist only to make
us respect the sea's dark secret?

13
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:11,746
<i>The question both
vexes and excites me,

14
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:15,652
<i>and is the reason I've written you
a second time to request a meeting.

15
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:17,024
<i>A conversation with you, Sir,

16
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,444
<i>I believe will serve me well
for the novel I intend to write,

17
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:23,560
<i>currently entitled Moby Dick

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,656
<i>I hope you will
reconsider my offer.

19
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:33,711
<i>The Unknown, that is where my
imagination yearns to venture.

20
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,133
<i>And so, the question plagues me still:

21
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,850
<i>How does a man come to
know The Unknowable?

22
00:02:41,698 --> 00:02:44,787
<i>Sincerely, Herman Melville.

23
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,408
We're closed!

24
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,916
No borders after eight o'clock.

25
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,949
You came.

26
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:13,405
There's someone here for you, My Love.

27
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,605
Tom Nickerson?

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,407
Herman Melville.

29
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,777
We received your letter.

30
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:26,861
You're either a desperate man or a
fool to come all the way to Nantucket.

31
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:32,262
Well, my offer still stands.

32
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,033
Three months'
lodgings for a single night's talk.

33
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,428
<i>It's all I have in the world.

34
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,123
<i>But I'd prefer to think
of it as an investment.

35
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,642
I want you to tell
me what happened...

36
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:46,446
to the Essex.

37
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,228
Well,
what do you think happened?

38
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:58,238
There are rumblings,
rumors that the Essex...

39
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:01,781
What do you want?
What story do you expect to hear?

40
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:03,961
That of The Whale.

41
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,118
The Essex ran aground,
there was a full inquiry.

42
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,731
I believe the inquiry
was less than truthful.

43
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,933
Get out.

44
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:19,617
You are the last
survivor or the Essex, Sir.

45
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,918
If you won't talk, who will?

46
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:26,073
You do not hear me, leave now.

47
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:33,032
- You mustn't go, please, just take a minute...
- He's in no mind to talk, and

48
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,501
I haven't come all this way to
be humiliated and waste my time.

49
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,329
Please, Mr. Melville,

50
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:43,939
he won't talk about the Essex to me,
to anyone... never has... never.

51
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,906
I don't know anything about him.

52
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:54,328
His soul is... in torment,
and in need of confession.

53
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:58,658
Please, just let me
talk to him... please.

54
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:06,247
Love,

55
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:13,420
I believe it would do you
good to talk to the man.

56
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,341
No!

57
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,946
You listen well!

58
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,126
Who holds this place together
while you drink yourself to death?

59
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:29,130
You WILL talk with this man,
as much as is necessary...

60
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:31,372
to keep the money.

61
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,541
You know our circumstances, Tom.

62
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:49,322
Only as much as is necessary.

63
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,990
I'll get whiskey.

64
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:05,779
I neglected to mention it in my letter,
but I was a whaler once.

65
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:10,849
<i>One trip.
I mean... green hand.

66
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,601
So, you've seen it all.

67
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,506
My wife read your books.

68
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:22,035
- She enjoyed them.
- Happy to hear it.

69
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,470
They had good sales,
but I think that THIS story

70
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:30,817
could surpass even the success of my
first novel... which did quite well.

71
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,753
Another of your seafaring yarns.

72
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,811
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

73
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:45,962
Now, there's a writer, a great writer.

74
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:47,627
He is.

75
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:53,204
But he is not here, and I am...

76
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:56,034
for my own particular reasons.

77
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,811
I'll tell you of the Essex,
I believe you will be disappointed,

78
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,819
but every word I say will be true.

79
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:17,486
The story of the Essex
is the story of two men...

80
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,890
Captain George Pollard,

81
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:25,567
and his first mate, Owen Chase.

82
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:29,029
Owen, you don't want to be late.

83
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:34,345
I'll be there, besides, can't have our
daughter sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

84
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:36,641
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

85
00:07:36,841 --> 00:07:41,862
Well, it has to be, so she can remind me why
I have to love you, and you being stubborn.

86
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,768
If it's to to be a daughter she'll
be a version of you, not me.

87
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:47,390
Blond locks and determined
to conquer the world.

88
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,090
I suppose after today you'll be tradin'
in that tunic for a uniform.

89
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:56,556
That's right, finally out of this patch
of dirt for a captain's house in Quaise.

90
00:07:56,745 --> 00:07:59,729
I don't need one of those houses
in town with stuffy neighbors.

91
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,863
There's plenty room here
for the three of us.

92
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:06,786
Ya know, sometimes your kind heart
and good nature is just unbearable.

93
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:10,281
Go get your captaincy.

94
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,579
<i>- What's your bid?
- One ninety.

95
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,332
<i>I've got a thousand
gallons at two dollars!

96
00:08:58,422 --> 00:08:59,811
<i>I'll take 40 shares.

97
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:04,075
<i>Seller, seller, over here!

98
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,957
<i>Criterion's back with a fine
haul, 1600 barrels.

99
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:17,106
A new record, 50 pounds Sterling
for headmatter on the London market.

100
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,738
Good morning Mr. Chase.

101
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,750
- Mr. Mason.
- Come in, please.

102
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:36,167
My partner, Benjamin Fuller.

103
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,758
- Good morning, Sir.
- Do sit down.

104
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,272
Mr. Chase, I do hope you
realize how satisfied we are

105
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,928
with the work you've done
for us over the years.

106
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh, thank you, Sir.

107
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,875
And one of our ships, the Essex

108
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:58,128
has just be refitted at great
expense and is to go to sea.

109
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,871
Now, having made such
an investment in her,

110
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:04,354
we want to be sure she's
in the best possible hands.

111
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,409
So...

112
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:10,131
it gives us great pleasure to
offer you a position aboard her...

113
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,571
as first mate.

114
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:17,721
- As first mate?
- Uh-hum.

115
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:22,031
Mr. Mason, you... you promised me command
of a ship after my last voyage when

116
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:26,828
I brought you back 1500 barrels,
do you remember? You gave me your word.

117
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,606
That promise must now be deferred.

118
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:33,078
Like everyone else we've
had a mean time recently.

119
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,591
Well, never on my watch.

120
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:39,533
Nantucket now dominates the world market,
that must not change.

121
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,685
This is no time for experimentation.

122
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:46,334
The Essex will be
captained by George Pollard,

123
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,423
scion of a great whaling family.

124
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:53,263
<i>His father also happens
to be our patron.

125
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:57,656
<i>Blood, Mr. Chase, you can have all
the voyages under your belt you want

126
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,708
<i>but blood will always win out.

127
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:02,663
Yes, well, blood's not gonna fill
the ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

128
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:06,563
<i>To successfully command, a captain needs
respect, now, what if the men don't respect him?

129
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:09,215
You will make sure that they do.

130
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,182
Good day, Gentlemen.

131
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:13,837
I understand your disappointment.

132
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:14,887
So...

133
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,020
A one-fifteenth lay.

134
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,866
And that's more than I've ever
paid any first officer.

135
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:27,604
And if you bring back 2000 barrels of oil,
I'll give you my word,

136
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:31,327
<i>next time you WILL
have your captaincy.

137
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:34,382
You've given me your word before,
Mr. Mason.

138
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,977
So, this time I'll take it in writing.

139
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:57,454
Captain Pollard, we've just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase,

140
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,687
who'd be honored to serve under you.

141
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,282
I'm glad to hear it.

142
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,818
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

143
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:10,160
Some cheerless Nantucket born
with a damned silver spoon in his mouth.

144
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,013
I should have thrown their
offer back in their faces.

145
00:12:12,086 --> 00:12:15,985
Why? You now have the
offer of command in writing.

146
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:19,546
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless,
even ON paper.

147
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:32,762
You know I'd love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain?

148
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,795
<i>And you wouldn't be
gone for two years.

149
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,376
I won't be gone two years.

150
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:39,455
A Bedford whaler came back
last week was gone three.

151
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,692
She lost two men and still
with her hull half empty.

152
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,571
Well, they were from Bedford
and they didn't have me aboard.

153
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,269
Son of a bitch!

154
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:57,219
I will captain my own ship...

155
00:12:58,297 --> 00:12:59,834
a whaling ship.

156
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:03,061
Up to them all we'd ever
have is a patch of dirt

157
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,481
and that's not going to happen, Peggy.

158
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,935
Those'd be your father's words, not yours.

159
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:08,575
What's wrong with his words?

160
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,278
He wanted things for his family, for himself.

161
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:15,705
- He was a dreamer, Owen
- Yes, he was.

162
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:19,622
Dreamed of the sea and never
got to sea with men like them.

163
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,877
At least he got to
see his children born.

164
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,557
It's all I know.

165
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,991
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,905
I married a whaleman.

167
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:55,275
I'll come back as quick as the sun is night,
I swear.

168
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,669
Please come back...
promise me.

169
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:14,780
I already swore to you,
now you want me to promise, too.

170
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:21,051
I promise.

171
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,208
Son, a word with you.

172
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:43,831
To be a captain, you cannot be a
friend, you are their superior.

173
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,049
Never forget that,
never let THEM forget that.

174
00:14:47,984 --> 00:14:49,288
Thank you, son.

175
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,383
Your great-grandfather and a few
others created this industry.

176
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:57,959
Without us, without you,
the world plunges into darkness.

177
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,162
I hope to bring honor
to the Pollard family name, Sir.

178
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:14,074
<i>Thou didst, O Lord, create the mighty whale,
That wondrous monster of a mighty length;

179
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,306
<i>Beyond conception his unmeasured strength.

180
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:24,327
<i>But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain
that we, poor feeble mortals

181
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,435
<i>should engage ourselves,
our wives and children to maintain,

182
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:34,060
<i>This dreadful monster with a martial rage.

183
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:42,296
<i>O Father, grant that your
glorious light shine on these men,

184
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:45,165
<i>and assure them a prosperous voyage,

185
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:49,045
<i>that they may return SAFELY
unto the womb ship.

186
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:52,964
<i>So that the white whales
of Nantucket whale oil

187
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:56,429
<i>may continue to keep
light in our homes,

188
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:03,082
<i>city streets safe from sin in the night,
fuel the machines of industry,

189
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:05,771
<i>drive our great nation forward,

190
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:12,376
<i>as our noble species evolves.
In Your name, we pray.

191
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:24,185
So, what month is this?

192
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:27,945
Oh, late in the year,
we were one of the last ships to go out.

193
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:31,441
Which is why my friend Barzillai
and I got a berth.

194
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:36,581
Look, I was fourteen... fourteen.

195
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,359
<i>Nickerson, you're standin' around, boy!
Move!

196
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,000
<i>First time at sea,
scared, more scared to show it.

197
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,048
<i>Barzillai was seventeen.

198
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:50,799
<i>Orphans, grew up on the wharf,</i>
both in a hurry to be called men.

199
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:56,808
<i>What are you all guys waiting for?
Get it aboard! C'mon! Haul away...!

200
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,969
What are those pins
they're wearing?

201
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,322
Those are whale pins, Thomas.

202
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,209
How do I get one of them?

203
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,987
Well,
you've gotta thrust a killing lance.

204
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,689
The largest beast ever
to breathe on the earth.

205
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,500
<i>Nickerson,
get the green stuff to Mr. Bond.

206
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,113
<i>Make it quick, damn it.

207
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,637
I shall have twelve of those one day.

208
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:23,658
Put 'em on the Grandira casket.

209
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:26,453
Well, well,
you being on board means only one thing.

210
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:30,431
Yep! At least there's one person on this ship
who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

211
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,300
No, but all the other ships
have already crewed up.

212
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,104
No, no, I'm a reformed man, Owen,
the question is are YOU?

213
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:40,524
Don't tell me Matthew Joy
has put down the bottle.

214
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:44,137
I have sinned.
Has Owen Chase put down his temper?

215
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:46,029
Serene as the Church.

216
00:17:46,229 --> 00:17:48,269
I'll believe THAT when I see it.

217
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:54,504
Given our captain I'll give
your serenity about 48 hours.

218
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:56,745
Good luck.

219
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,321
- Pollard, George Pollard.
- Owen Chase.

220
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:11,082
- Chase, your father's name, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

221
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:15,902
Very shortly he will be off island for
some time and I'll be very much at home.

222
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:22,293
I say, I was surprised, normally
a captain gets to choose his first mate.

223
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:24,713
An experienced captain, yes.

224
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:26,801
Of course, you can understand
from the owners' point of view,

225
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:29,358
they wanted to put their
investments in the hands of men.

226
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:30,858
Indeed.

227
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,896
They probably wanted a
little extra reassurance, that's all.

228
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:36,981
Well, DO keep an eye on me,
let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.

229
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,311
I'd have it not other way, Captain.

230
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:52,295
Shore up the anchor.

231
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,536
- Head's in the wind, is the top rail off?
<i>- Aye.

232
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:55,945
- Collard, Take the helm!
- Aye!

233
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,124
Mr. Joy, make sail.

234
00:18:57,224 --> 00:18:59,805
Mr. Cole, Mr. Chappel,
stand by this anchor!

235
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,769
Mr. Chappel, take the helm!

236
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:27,952
Boyd! Why aren't those braces laid out?

237
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,199
Set the sail, god damn it!

238
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:52,996
Heading to scram.

239
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:56,063
- Captain! Heads up!
- Behind you head, Captain!

240
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:02,389
- What happened, Mr. Sheppard?
- The jalousie felled the sheet, Sir.

241
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:07,296
- The jalousie's jammed!
- Chase, she still won't clear!

242
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,791
<i>Watch your step!

243
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:22,101
It's the jalousie, Owen!

244
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,880
Stand clear!

245
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,153
<i>Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase!

246
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,500
If we make Cape Verdes in
the next 2 weeks we'll

247
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,860
have a decent chance of reaching
the Pacific on schedule.

248
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:26,376
Corn, Mr. Chase?

249
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:29,672
No, thank you, Sir,
never did have much of a taste for it.

250
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:31,952
That's odd.

251
00:21:32,452 --> 00:21:36,461
- So, your father grew corn on Cape Cod.
- That's right, he did.

252
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:39,854
As you can imagine, I suddenly
grew tired of eating it every day.

253
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:48,074
Corn, okra, beans, I believe?
Before he went to jail.

254
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:53,303
Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?

255
00:21:55,041 --> 00:22:00,533
Were you aware that Mr. Chase was effectively
orphaned due to his father's incarceration?

256
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:04,070
Well, we all have our paths to sea.

257
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,664
That's a motive to not
ask too many questions.

258
00:22:09,056 --> 00:22:11,577
Can't have been easy though, yet...

259
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:16,005
You had Nantucket's great
seafaring family to adopt you.

260
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:19,741
This is far from the first time
I've been called a landsman...

261
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:25,914
or off-islander by some Nantucket reminding
me how I am NOT part of their family.

262
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:31,499
Now, if the captain will excuse me,
there are whale boats and watches to assign.

263
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:41,186
- No, Sir, not for me.
- Not a drop?

264
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,949
No, Sir, like I said, sometimes the
fewer questions one asks, the better.

265
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:08,227
That's a gorgeous girl, Mr. Joy.

266
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:12,094
Region of move me that,
carved from a Far East whalebone.

267
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:14,454
No touching!

268
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:15,753
I always thought you
were married anyway.

269
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,114
I am, and there she is.

270
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,028
Well, that's her nose anyway.

271
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,685
Congratulations, ladies.

272
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:28,633
That was a fine job trimin' sails today.

273
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:32,596
A sorrier pack of deck-whalers
I don't think I've ever seen.

274
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:36,303
- Mr. Chappel.
- Sir.

275
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:38,093
Captain's harpooner.

276
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,682
- Mr. Lawrence, you'll be mine.
- Aye, Sir.

277
00:23:41,882 --> 00:23:46,543
And Mr. Peterson, second mate's harpooner.

278
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:47,443
Aye, Sir.

279
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:52,039
There'll be six men to a boat,
first rules in the row, six bells sharp.

280
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,167
We're not even east of Halifax, Sir.

281
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:59,279
- What's your name?
- Coffin, Henry Coffin.

282
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,549
<i>He's the Captain's cousin, Sir.

283
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:07,681
Well, well, Mr. Coffin, do you think
a whale knows it's east of Halifax?

284
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:14,421
I don't know who all of you are,
or how you got here,

285
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:17,608
Some of you probably have felonies,
or are hidin' or on the run.

286
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:22,749
That's fine, I don't give a damn,
but we interred you for just one thing...

287
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:27,406
and one thing only,
and that is whale oil.

288
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:31,513
<i>I intend to fill our 2000 barrels
and be home as quickly as possible.

289
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:35,315
And even when the weather is fine
and there ARE no whales, Mr. Coffin,

290
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:40,021
<i>we will lower the boats and practice all
maneuvers</i> necessary in a capture of a whale.

291
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:43,489
And any man who is idle will find himself
swimmin' to home. Is that understood?

292
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:45,873
- Aye, sir. Aye, Sir.
- Aye, Sir.

293
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:53,094
Green horn, on deck!

294
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:57,764
On ya go!

295
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,410
Aye, aye, landsman.

296
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,952
- Thomas Nickerson, right?
- Aye, Sir.

297
00:25:05,152 --> 00:25:07,532
Ya know, some feel sick at first.

298
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:14,875
- Pull me back up!
- Best way to square up to King Neptune, Boy.

299
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:16,553
Please, bring me up.

300
00:25:20,873 --> 00:25:22,834
Better now?

301
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:29,428
Sir, I am so sorry.

302
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:33,731
Well, now you got something to
write home to your mother about.

303
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,925
My mother's buried up in Smith's Hill,

304
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,500
and a stone for my father, too, he was...

305
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,456
he was lost at sea before I was born.

306
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:49,144
Here, give me that.

307
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:55,578
The whale's is your family now,
Boy, for better or for worse.

308
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,568
For worse mostly.

309
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,998
Swab the deck, Kid!

310
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:23,140
<i>You're a long way from base
to be whaling and sailing.

311
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,825
<i>Aye, aye, Captain.

312
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,671
<i>- You got that line wrong, Nickerson.
- Aye, Captain.

313
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:30,088
<i>We'll stay at this until
sunlight if we have to.

314
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,367
<i>Aye, Captain.

315
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:33,887
Harpooners make ready to boat.

316
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:51,767
- Need to move quicker, Mr. Ray!
- My mistake.

317
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:55,072
<i>Ain't no more wee whores, Mr. Chase.

318
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:57,909
<i>You're a sailor, now! Yeah!.

319
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,163
Not bad, Mr. Ray, well done!

320
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:07,289
<i>Get used to it, mates,
you gotta work like horses.

321
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,833
- Mr. Chase.
- Sir.

322
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,610
Set stuns'ls.

323
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,810
Is that wise, Sir,
we're near the Gulf Stream.

324
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:17,217
Best to be five knots
fto even see the weather.

325
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,304
We are two days behind.

326
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,800
<i>You need to make up the time
before we catch the east wind.

327
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:25,261
Set stuns'ls.

328
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,176
Set stuns'ls.

329
00:27:33,212 --> 00:27:35,088
Belay that, set stuns'ls.

330
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:38,292
<i>Get her off, Mr. Coffin,
the Captain wants speed!

331
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:39,342
<i>Aye, Sir.

332
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,594
<i>She might be old but
she can still blow, boys!

333
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,915
Sir, a squall on the starboard route,
we need to shorten the sail immediately.

334
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:40,232
Not just yet, Mr. Chase.

335
00:28:40,374 --> 00:28:42,637
Sir, we are headed into a
storm of more than 8 knots

336
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:43,859
and it's movin' faster than that.

337
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:46,547
Let it come,
the men are soft from months on land, they

338
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:50,099
need a good baptism,
let them know our work has begun.

339
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,750
If we don't shorten sail and bear off
it'll catch us on the beam.

340
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,922
Chase, we will stand on.

341
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:03,273
- Mr. Lawrence, hold our course.
- Holding course, Sir.

342
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,274
We'll lose half a day running like that.

343
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,443
We'll scut the end of it,
if the men can't

344
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,344
handle a gust like this,
then God help us all.

345
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:23,076
<I>Best secure for heavy weather.

346
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:45,047
Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond,
we're headed into a squall.

347
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,259
- We must fall off and run with it.
- Stand down, Mr. Chase.

348
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:12,703
- Mr. Lawrence, hold your course.
- Holding course, Sir.

349
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:30,409
Shorten the sails, Mr. Chase.

350
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,971
<i>We need to cut
those sails down!

351
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,718
Turn the ship,
head for land!

352
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:01,906
No, the damage is done!

353
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:07,792
It's too late, it's too god damned late!

354
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:10,029
We'll be broadsided!

355
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,691
Hold on!

356
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,281
<i>Look out!

357
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,167
Mr. Joy!

358
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:27,427
<i>- We have to cut away the...
- I've got it, Owen!

359
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:29,346
<i>We have to set her up right!

360
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,833
You wish to see me, Sir.

361
00:33:26,417 --> 00:33:30,554
At six bells tomorrow,
you will assemble the crew,

362
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:34,850
inform them that we will be returning
to Nantucket for repairs.

363
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,166
You will then apologize to them
for interfering with a captain's order

364
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,874
which nearly cost the lives of
every man on this ship today.

365
00:33:42,074 --> 00:33:42,621
What?

366
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:45,482
I'll accept your resignation
upon our return to port.

367
00:33:45,682 --> 00:33:47,083
That will be all.

368
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:48,934
It was your order to set stuns'ls, Sir.

369
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:51,853
That decision was sound,
the men needed testing.

370
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:53,986
- You sent 'em into a storm?
- That...

371
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:55,703
was unlucky.

372
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:59,849
No, it was bad seamanship, and blaming
misfortune is just plain weakness.

373
00:33:59,944 --> 00:34:03,943
Damn your impertinence!
Do you know who you're speaking to?

374
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:08,287
My name is CAPTAIN George Pollard.
POLLARD!

375
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:15,475
And you Mr. Chase, no matter how many
whale pins you may have on your lapel,

376
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,804
are nothing more than
the son of a farmer,

377
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,116
who's managed to bullying his
way into an officer's tunic.

378
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:24,316
Now, get out!

379
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:31,470
To return to port without a single
barrel of oil would be a mistake, Sir.

380
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:37,097
<i>And not behoove a man whose name is
Pollard... or Chase, for that matter.

381
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:41,563
And the best thing for both of us
would be t'work all hours God sends us.

382
00:34:41,763 --> 00:34:44,762
Fill this ship with oil,
and be home inside a year

383
00:34:44,774 --> 00:34:47,505
and rid of one another
as quickly as possible.

384
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:53,570
Trust me, I have never been
as desirous of that as you.

385
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:59,521
Of course, that is the Captain's decision.

386
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:12,878
<i>They were like a new married couple.

387
00:35:14,693 --> 00:35:17,525
A new married couple tolerate each other,
Mr. Melville,

388
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,444
<i>but a new married couple
can also bring down a ship.

389
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:24,050
- You married, Mr. Melville?
- I am.

390
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:26,270
The Lord have mercy on ya.

391
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,518
First child on the way, too.

392
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,663
So, does your good wife know that you brought
all you have in the world here tonight,

393
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:34,833
and givin' it to a stranger?

394
00:35:35,643 --> 00:35:38,709
- No, Sir.
- You're full of surprises, aren't you?

395
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:45,645
So... the Essex did not return to port.

396
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:48,804
- She did not.
- She continued out to sea.

397
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:56,231
Yes, she did, but before long, we heard
the call this all whale men pray for...

398
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,606
Ho!

399
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,535
Blows!

400
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,061
<i>A big one!
Thar she blows!

401
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:10,087
<i>- White or sperm, Mr. Ramsdell?
- Sperm whales they are!

402
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,315
Mr. Chase, hoist and swing boat.

403
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:18,711
- All Hands! All hands on deck!
<i>- All hands on deck!

404
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:26,992
<i>Lower away!

405
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:13,623
Come on, put your back into it.!

406
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:25,172
There's the calf.

407
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:31,601
- That's the calf?
- That's the cow!

408
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,864
<i>That's our boy!
That's the money!

409
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:47,103
Nickerson! Push!

410
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:49,978
- Forty barrels there?
- Fifty!

411
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:52,959
<i>Boy, he's a buster!

412
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,429
<i>Take the oars, lads!
Quick or he'll god damn run!

413
00:37:57,594 --> 00:38:01,415
Pull those oars up!
Smartly, lads, smartly!

414
00:38:01,965 --> 00:38:03,713
<i>Mind your oars!

415
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:07,566
<i>- Mr. Ramsdell, prepare the line.
- Aye, Sir.

416
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,825
<i>The first one's mine.

417
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:16,095
Aim her to the free spot!

418
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,923
<i>Pull! Pull! Stay on him.

419
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:41,369
You're on your first
Nantucket sleigh ride, Boys.

420
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:58,436
The most fearsome creature
to ever live on this earth.

421
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:14,182
My hand!

422
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,207
<i>You need to wet the line, Nickerson.

423
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:39,739
<i>A hundred forty fathoms' of line left,
Mr. Chase.

424
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,796
<i>Eighty fathoms' of line left, Sir.

425
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,762
<i>He's gonna pull us under!

426
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:02,120
- Matthew, I need your line!
- Feed the line!

427
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,617
<i>- Peterson give me the line!
- Aye, Sir.

428
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:09,466
<i>- Give me that line, Mr. Peterson.
- We're down to 60 fathoms' of line left, Sir.

429
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,148
<i>- Twenty fathoms, Mr. Chase!
- Tie it off!

430
00:40:18,651 --> 00:40:20,147
Go!

431
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:35,006
- Peterson, lay on!
- Aye, Sir.

432
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:38,227
How many fathoms can he draw?

433
00:40:42,995 --> 00:40:44,706
No, no, no, wait!

434
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:51,346
- Owen!
- Oh, no, not yet!

435
00:40:51,446 --> 00:40:55,338
- Don't touch that line.
<i>- Down to 50 fathoms, Sir.

436
00:40:57,527 --> 00:41:00,456
- Owen! God damn it!
- I said don't touch it!

437
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:01,506
<i>Thirty fathoms left, Mr. Joy.

438
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,680
<i>Ten fathoms left, Sir!

439
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:34,324
It's been a long drive.

440
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:53,325
Blubber in the oil.

441
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:56,138
<i>They're gonna eat your money.

442
00:42:56,238 --> 00:42:58,605
<i>Get out of there, you sons of bitches!

443
00:43:01,877 --> 00:43:04,428
<i>- You got it?
- Got it, Chase.

444
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:09,859
- How's it lookin'?
- Not good.

445
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:13,735
That's it.

446
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,880
- Mr. Chase, Sir?
- Yep.

447
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,312
That's all of it, Sir,
we can't get anymore out.

448
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:25,123
That's the gold in there,
Boys, c'mon, keep diggin'.

449
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,250
- I'm too big to really go down there.
- Then find someone who can.

450
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:36,928
Nickerson, come here boy!

451
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,167
<i>Hey! I said c'mere!

452
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,038
Climb on in with 'im.

453
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,219
<i>Come on, Thomas.

454
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:52,262
<i>What's in there is worth a HELLEVA lot
more than what they're boilin' down.

455
00:43:57,442 --> 00:44:02,162
Sir, I can't, I'm sorry.
I can't.

456
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,709
You get down there,
or I'll have you sleep down there.

457
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:10,454
You best put that between your teeth, Boy.

458
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,325
It tastes worse than the
Devil's asshole down there.

459
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,057
Thank you.

460
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:27,264
- Sorry.
<i>- Here, Nickerson, take my pillow with ya!

461
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,447
Down ya go.

462
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:50,082
A man gets to know
himself down there.

463
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:57,225
- Did they ever send you into a whale's head?
- No, I was spared.

464
00:44:57,791 --> 00:45:00,894
Well, that's where the treasure is.

465
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,919
I'll never forget that first bull.

466
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,204
Forty-seven barrels... of course,
the happiness was short lived.

467
00:45:11,254 --> 00:45:13,698
The waters had all been fished out?

468
00:45:13,846 --> 00:45:19,441
That they had.
So, we headed further out.

469
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:25,066
It was a month around the Horn.

470
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:30,171
<i>Left the South Atlantic
behind with a sliver of hope

471
00:45:30,221 --> 00:45:32,606
<i>that things would
change for the better.

472
00:45:34,217 --> 00:45:37,473
<i>But making the Pacific
didn't improve our lot.

473
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:42,866
<i>Whale sightings were TOO damn scarce.

474
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:48,394
<i>After nearly a year at sea the
temperaments of our captain.

475
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,057
<i>And our first mate
grew more strained.

476
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:56,686
<i>Captain Pollard spent most
days and nights in his cabin,

477
00:45:56,828 --> 00:45:59,237
<i>afraid to look his crew in the eye.

478
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,824
<i>Our hold was almost empty.

479
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:13,115
<i>To gaze upon our paltry efforts
only served as a reminder

480
00:46:13,254 --> 00:46:16,235
<i>that we were a long way
from going home.

481
00:46:39,794 --> 00:46:43,005
I don't talk that talk.
Speak English?

482
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:48,990
They're talking whale oil.

483
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:45,873
Capitán.

484
00:47:46,023 --> 00:47:49,782
Excuse me, the locals told me
that your voyage was waylaid, Sir.

485
00:47:50,322 --> 00:47:52,686
Captain George Pollard, the Essex.

486
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:56,365
Capitán Clemente Pelaez, the Santa Maria.

487
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:59,476
Would you buy a
colleague a drink?

488
00:48:00,173 --> 00:48:02,708
<i>- Same as always, George.
- Yes, Captain

489
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:09,574
Bad luck, huh?

490
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:11,937
How far out?

491
00:48:12,443 --> 00:48:14,657
Far enough for only a fool to go.

492
00:48:14,984 --> 00:48:16,384
How far would that be?

493
00:48:17,507 --> 00:48:20,429
A thousand leagues
along the Equator...

494
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,860
in offshore grounds.

495
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:25,229
Were there whales there?

496
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,023
More than you've ever dreamt.

497
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:32,922
Hundreds... fields of flukes
as far as the eye can see.

498
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:36,490
<i>They could fill up 3000 barrels
in the space of a day.

499
00:48:36,593 --> 00:48:38,448
What do you mean, "Could have"?

500
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:45,229
If it weren't for that demon...

501
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,404
a whale.

502
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:51,113
<i>White as alabaster,

503
00:48:51,213 --> 00:48:52,989
a hundred feet long,

504
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:56,959
sent six of my crew to their graves,

505
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,573
and the rest of us, something
to remember him by.

506
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,554
Now, this white whale, did he dance
a jig and pick your pocket, as well?

507
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:21,056
Thank you.

508
00:49:24,305 --> 00:49:25,624
Do you believe that?

509
00:49:28,761 --> 00:49:31,806
We set sail now,
catch the south easterlies,

510
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:35,857
this is by our best time, fill our belly,
we can be home in six months.

511
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,803
What say you, Mr. Chase?

512
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:42,504
No need to endure our predicament
for a moment longer than necessary.

513
00:49:42,554 --> 00:49:43,763
Amen to that.

514
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:46,273
Amen.

515
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:50,819
<i>Greed took hold of our
Captain and the first mate.

516
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:55,621
<i>So, we headed out...
a thousand leagues along the Equator...

517
00:49:56,548 --> 00:50:00,538
<i>but with no agenda, speculation began.

518
00:50:01,347 --> 00:50:03,192
<i>This is where the
whales are gonna hide.

519
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,834
<i>It was as far from land
as we could possibly go.

520
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,327
<i>But we hunted them down.

521
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:14,798
<i>Centuries before, sailors feared
sailing off the edge of the earth,

522
00:50:16,817 --> 00:50:19,292
<i>but we were headed
for the edge of sanity.

523
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:25,956
<i>Trust gave way to doubt...

524
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:29,455
<i>hope to blind superstition.

525
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:32,028
Cap'n, the men are talking.

526
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:34,416
That's what men do.

527
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:37,233
They aren't happy with your
decision to sail out this far.

528
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,397
Well, did you correct them?

529
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:43,036
Did you remind them of our purpose
to fill this ship with whale oil

530
00:50:43,086 --> 00:50:46,172
and if the whales ARE a thousand
leagues out, then that is where we go?

531
00:50:46,297 --> 00:50:52,811
Cousin, please, this is madness.

532
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:57,202
You have let yourself be
influenced by that man.

533
00:50:57,252 --> 00:50:58,807
You must turn this ship back.

534
00:50:59,574 --> 00:51:05,681
I suggest you go back down,
reassure the men, the leader,

535
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:10,544
and don't ever, ever abuse the
privilege of family with me again...

536
00:51:12,582 --> 00:51:14,058
Mr. Coffin.

537
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,441
What is it?

538
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,083
- Listen...
<i>- Mr. Chase.

539
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:50,043
- I see some white water.
- Where?

540
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:51,494
Port side!

541
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,190
You hearin' it?

542
00:52:02,116 --> 00:52:05,310
- Lower away!
<i>- Lower away!

543
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,054
The Devil'll take the Mexican ground.

544
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:57,755
Stick him hard!
Stick him!

545
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:03,211
Straight ahead, Peterson.

546
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:16,406
Don't let him chew the oars, Boys.

547
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:18,168
Back to it!

548
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:44,646
- The whale?
- Yes.

549
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:47,089
- So, it's true.
- Yes.

550
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:49,873
Too much is true.

551
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,386
Full pressure!

552
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:27,558
Mr. Bond, back to 4 yards,
lower the tackle!

553
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:29,008
Aye, Sir.

554
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:49,054
Mr. Lawrence, take us leeward
headed straight for the school.

555
00:54:49,104 --> 00:54:49,915
<i>Right, Sir.

556
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,201
- Hot tar, Sir.
- We'll find him.

557
00:54:57,255 --> 00:54:59,212
We're close to black skin.

558
00:54:59,613 --> 00:55:01,126
Sneak up on her!

559
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:12,350
She's ours, Lads.

560
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:46,186
What was that, Mr. Lawrence?

561
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:51,744
<i>Mr. Chase.

562
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:01,695
God damn it.

563
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,203
Find Mr. Lawrence...

564
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,384
Get Mr. Lawrence to man the pumps!

565
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:50,790
Where is he?

566
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:52,742
Port bow!

567
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:06,449
Get me the biggest
tines we have.

568
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:11,788
<i>He wants a fight.

569
00:57:21,448 --> 00:57:24,127
- I never seen a whale do that.
<i>- Mr. Lawrence, take the wheel.

570
00:57:24,243 --> 00:57:27,356
<i>Mr. Ramsdell, secure the other
end of the line to the foremast.

571
00:57:27,506 --> 00:57:28,301
Aye, Sir.

572
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,683
As I live and breathe, he's mine.

573
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:19,447
<i>Look out!

574
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:13,760
Cap'n...

575
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:16,843
<i>The Essex, it's listing.

576
00:59:28,094 --> 00:59:30,198
<i>Help me turn around.

577
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:10,993
<i>- That's it, be brave.
- Here! Full ahead, Mr. Nickerson.

578
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:49,149
Mr. Chase.

579
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,476
A whale threw her, it stove the ship.

580
01:00:55,181 --> 01:00:56,181
What?

581
01:00:56,314 --> 01:00:58,570
We lost Easton and Sanborn.

582
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,382
The pumps are useless, Sir.

583
01:01:10,244 --> 01:01:13,898
- Prepare to abandon ship.
- We can't row away home!

584
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:17,045
We have to strip from the
sails and jimmy-rig something.

585
01:01:17,095 --> 01:01:17,764
Aye, Sir.

586
01:01:17,814 --> 01:01:19,798
<i>Get as much food and
water as you can carry.

587
01:01:20,413 --> 01:01:22,763
<i>We're gonna need all the
fresh water you can find.

588
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:24,906
<i>We stick together
as much as we can.

589
01:01:32,024 --> 01:01:34,510
<i>Mr. Chappel, the provisions!

590
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:39,290
<i>Take as much food
as you can carry.

591
01:01:41,092 --> 01:01:44,898
<i>Make way!

592
01:01:45,649 --> 01:01:48,088
- Got it?
<i>- Hard tack and stock!

593
01:01:48,244 --> 01:01:50,821
<i>- Grab the candles there!
- Lower away!

594
01:01:50,871 --> 01:01:51,871
Take those tack lockers.

595
01:01:58,053 --> 01:01:59,851
Pull her up!

596
01:02:07,143 --> 01:02:08,606
Come on, Nickerson!

597
01:02:11,237 --> 01:02:12,836
<i>Pace yourself!

598
01:02:37,355 --> 01:02:40,185
- Grab the hand! I got you!
- Get 'im up!

599
01:02:52,669 --> 01:02:54,547
<i>Gotta get away from the oil.

600
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,407
<i>- Nickerson! Where is Mr. Chase?
- He was just here, Sir.

601
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,221
<i>Mr. Chase!

602
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,063
Mr. Chase, Sir!

603
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:37,144
<i>- Where is the first mate?
- Away!

604
01:03:37,194 --> 01:03:39,325
<i>Mr. Chase, Sir!

605
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:52,821
<i>Mr. Chase, Sir!

606
01:04:40,963 --> 01:04:43,559
There he is!
There he is! There he is!

607
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:47,063
<i>- Over there!
- There's Mr. Chase!

608
01:04:48,268 --> 01:04:50,435
<i>Mr. Chase!

609
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:56,737
We got him.

610
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:05,346
Goin' fishin', are we?

611
01:05:05,396 --> 01:05:07,571
Clear and loaded, Mr. Joy.

612
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:22,744
Back away,
or she'll take us down with her.

613
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:09,838
Captain, what about our provisions?

614
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,621
Two ounces of hardtack
a day per man...

615
01:07:19,492 --> 01:07:21,334
and half a cup of water.

616
01:07:25,348 --> 01:07:26,940
We can't live on that.

617
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:47,112
It's he!

618
01:07:51,744 --> 01:07:53,541
Yeah, it's him all right.

619
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:59,110
You don't fool me, Mr. Chase.

620
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:01,666
- Mr. Coffin.
- That right?

621
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:05,127
You put us here,
you know you put us here.

622
01:08:06,569 --> 01:08:08,791
- Hey! Put it down.
- Put the pistol down!

623
01:08:08,841 --> 01:08:09,766
Say you're scared!

624
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:11,626
Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down!

625
01:08:11,676 --> 01:08:12,676
You know what happens when
the food and water runs out!

626
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:16,103
Do as the Captain says, Coffin!

627
01:08:16,153 --> 01:08:16,790
I just want to see

628
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,903
- the landsman scared.
- Coffin, put the pistol down!

629
01:08:18,953 --> 01:08:21,324
- That's an order!
- Do as the Captain says! Now!

630
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:22,930
- Say it!
- Henry.

631
01:08:22,991 --> 01:08:25,282
Say it! Say it!

632
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,864
<i>Henry!
Put the pistol down.

633
01:08:33,436 --> 01:08:36,908
Henry, put it down.

634
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:14,978
So, east it was,

635
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:18,122
<i>back in the direction we'd come,

636
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,893
<i>With only the sun and a compass.

637
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:25,095
<i>All directions looked the same.

638
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:29,185
<i>Our hope was to catch the
westerlies to Easter Island,

639
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:32,797
<i>a journey of 3,000 miles.

640
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:35,813
For 12 days we've drifted south.

641
01:09:36,263 --> 01:09:38,087
Six degrees latitude.

642
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,543
Not one mile closer to Easter Island.

643
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:48,511
We are cursed.

644
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:51,642
We'll make up for it when
we catch the variables.

645
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:56,150
We'll catch 'em.

646
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:32,443
<i>Hold on, Captain!

647
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:40,561
<i>Mr. Joy, the halyard's jammed.

648
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:47,299
<i>Mr. Joy!
Grab at it, Mr. Joy!

649
01:10:53,884 --> 01:10:55,707
<i>Matthew!

650
01:11:29,003 --> 01:11:32,474
Matthew, okay, what happened?
What happened?

651
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,545
- What are you doing here?
- Let me take a look.

652
01:11:35,595 --> 01:11:37,727
- No, no, no.
- Let me take a look.

653
01:11:37,777 --> 01:11:38,789
I'm fine, I'm fine.

654
01:11:38,839 --> 01:11:41,555
Just relax, I know,
I know, let me take a look.

655
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:49,746
I'm hit on the head, it's good, right?

656
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:52,051
- Give him some water!
- I don't need any water!

657
01:11:52,101 --> 01:11:53,994
Give him some God damned water.

658
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:56,612
No, no, no,
I don't need water, I'm fine.

659
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,269
<i>Take that, take it!

660
01:12:07,776 --> 01:12:09,315
I gotcha, I gotcha!

661
01:12:09,419 --> 01:12:12,127
All right, you'll be all right.

662
01:12:16,902 --> 01:12:18,904
Hey, what are you all looking at,
I'm fine.

663
01:12:19,254 --> 01:12:21,420
Cap'n Pollard, this is fiddle.

664
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,549
This is God damn fiddle,
ya hear me?

665
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:26,471
- Owen.
- Yeah.

666
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:29,523
I'm fine, all right, I'm fine.

667
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:33,452
- Thank you.
- I'm fine! Get out of here!

668
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:35,743
Be good.

669
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:37,922
<i>Let's go.

670
01:12:39,493 --> 01:12:42,560
Why waste water on a dead man?

671
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:47,759
Fancy men who know each other,
sailed together since childhood.

672
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:49,188
<i>Now, tell me,

673
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:52,045
<i>could you just sit there and
watch your own brother die?

674
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:56,083
It's simply a matter of numbers,
Mr. Chappel.

675
01:12:56,797 --> 01:12:58,616
There's not enough
for all of us.

676
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:13,074
Why waste water on a dead man?

677
01:13:14,344 --> 01:13:15,789
Why waste water...

678
01:13:16,763 --> 01:13:18,221
<i>Why waste water?

679
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:21,767
Why waste water on a dead man?

680
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:23,842
Mr. Nickerson?

681
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,243
- Why waste water on a dead man?
- Are you all right, Sir.

682
01:13:28,026 --> 01:13:30,524
- I cannot.
- Cannot what?

683
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:34,771
No, you... you... you have
enough, you have more than enough.

684
01:13:34,821 --> 01:13:36,266
But, Sir! We've come so far.

685
01:13:36,342 --> 01:13:39,649
- We have come to an end.
- We have an agreement, Sir.

686
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:42,830
Take the money and leave!
You've a devil's bargain!

687
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:46,732
No, Sir,
the devil loves his unspoken secrets...

688
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:52,852
especially those that
fester in a man's soul.

689
01:13:54,749 --> 01:13:56,297
What's yours?

690
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:17,400
I'm not a great writer.

691
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,441
I'm not Hawthorne.

692
01:14:23,211 --> 01:14:25,465
<i>After my first hearing of Odysseus,

693
01:14:26,074 --> 01:14:28,016
<i>this tale has haunted me.

694
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:31,406
It consumes me.

695
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:34,672
I fear if I do not write it,

696
01:14:36,632 --> 01:14:38,490
I should never write again.

697
01:14:39,864 --> 01:14:41,265
What else?

698
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,006
I fear if I DO write it,

699
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:49,606
that it will not be as
good as it should be.

700
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:01,722
Continue the story, Sir...

701
01:15:02,648 --> 01:15:04,452
for the both of us.

702
01:15:20,874 --> 01:15:22,463
Pass that down.

703
01:15:27,508 --> 01:15:28,866
Here.

704
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:37,420
We thank thee, Lord,
for this is our food...

705
01:15:38,687 --> 01:15:43,118
for light, good health,
with every good.

706
01:15:44,065 --> 01:15:45,031
<i>There.

707
01:15:45,935 --> 01:15:46,967
Land!

708
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:50,034
Land, Owen! Land!

709
01:15:50,905 --> 01:15:53,409
Land! Land! Land!

710
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:56,066
Row! Get 'way! Get 'way!

711
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:01,747
<i>Row!

712
01:16:20,287 --> 01:16:23,154
Hold fast! Hold fast! Hold fast!

713
01:16:24,616 --> 01:16:26,426
Mr.Chase, what is it, Sir?

714
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:30,125
Mr. Chase, what the devil is it,
why have you stopped?

715
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:32,354
- He's been following us.
<i>- What?

716
01:16:34,314 --> 01:16:35,650
<i>There's nothin' out there,
Mr. Chase.

717
01:16:35,738 --> 01:16:37,351
There ain't nothin' out there,
Sir.

718
01:16:37,442 --> 01:16:39,191
Sir, what are you doing?

719
01:17:21,844 --> 01:17:23,147
Where is he?

720
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:26,563
It could be Ducie Island.

721
01:19:27,335 --> 01:19:30,470
Without a map, compass or quadrant
there's no way to be certain.

722
01:19:30,685 --> 01:19:32,832
<i>We will keep fires
going night and day,

723
01:19:33,396 --> 01:19:36,550
<i>hope a passing ship
catches sight of our smoke.

724
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,602
<i>This is what I
wanted you to see.

725
01:20:43,799 --> 01:20:46,407
They've been here a long time,
for no doubt...

726
01:20:47,197 --> 01:20:48,621
waiting for a ship.

727
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:51,175
But no ship came.

728
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:55,618
No ship is going to come.

729
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,200
If we stay, we die.

730
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,171
<i>How long do you think it
would take to trust the birds

731
01:21:01,248 --> 01:21:03,789
<i>to stop coming here once
they see their eggs eaten?

732
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:26,351
It's a privilege to know the
moment of one's death in advance.

733
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:28,419
And to be able to prepare for it...

734
01:21:29,705 --> 01:21:32,694
a curse to be
so far from home...

735
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:38,150
or a chance to say goodbyes,
without a chance to make peace...

736
01:21:39,018 --> 01:21:41,308
or a chance to settle scores.

737
01:21:44,256 --> 01:21:46,993
But alas,
at least those are settled between us,

738
01:21:47,422 --> 01:21:48,854
Cap'n?

739
01:21:50,793 --> 01:21:52,354
Captain of what?

740
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:55,287
The Essex was lost
and no fault o'yours.

741
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,422
- I was as much to blame...
- You were not the Captain!

742
01:22:03,854 --> 01:22:06,154
You were born to do this job.

743
01:22:06,997 --> 01:22:09,081
I was just born into it.

744
01:22:21,838 --> 01:22:23,834
What we do, do ya think, George?

745
01:22:25,465 --> 01:22:29,534
What offense did we give
God to upset him so?

746
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:32,481
The only creature to have
offended God here is the whale.

747
01:22:33,286 --> 01:22:34,470
Not us?

748
01:22:36,382 --> 01:22:40,006
Not our arrogance, our greed?
Look where we find ourselves.

749
01:22:40,056 --> 01:22:42,587
We are supreme creatures made
in God's own likeness.

750
01:22:43,983 --> 01:22:45,611
We're earthly kings,

751
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:49,661
whose business it is to circumnavigate
the planet bestowed to us.

752
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,410
And to bend nature to OUR will.

753
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,080
You really feel like an earthly king
after everything that we've been through?

754
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,057
- We're nothing... we're specks... dust.
- But we're...

755
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,168
We sail into the sun at dawn.

756
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:10,122
If we are to die, with God's grace.

757
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:13,065
Let us die as men.

758
01:23:24,442 --> 01:23:27,346
<i>- Are we ready, Mr. Weeks?
- Aye, Sir.

759
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:36,267
Mr. Chappel.

760
01:23:36,337 --> 01:23:38,938
- Mr. Wright.
- I can't do it, Sir.

761
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:41,803
Me, Locks and Weeks...

762
01:23:43,115 --> 01:23:44,598
we're stayin'.

763
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,283
Ready to go, Matthew?

764
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:08,225
- I'll give you a hand here...
- What's the point?

765
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:10,611
- You hear me?
- No, we're goin' home, we're goin' home.

766
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,082
There's no point.

767
01:24:12,898 --> 01:24:14,347
Just go.

768
01:24:18,156 --> 01:24:20,372
God damn it, Matthew.

769
01:24:23,079 --> 01:24:24,474
It's all right.

770
01:24:25,445 --> 01:24:27,605
I'll send a boat for you
the minute we get back.

771
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,054
And we'll play cards
back in Nantucket, all right?

772
01:24:30,684 --> 01:24:33,736
- Yeah, it's a deal.
- Good.

773
01:24:40,449 --> 01:24:42,367
You want me to open that for ya?

774
01:24:46,365 --> 01:24:48,511
Naw, I think I'll manage.

775
01:24:54,676 --> 01:24:56,331
God be with you, Brother.

776
01:24:58,148 --> 01:24:59,971
And you.

777
01:25:18,519 --> 01:25:20,221
Brother Peterson?

778
01:25:21,864 --> 01:25:24,768
- Y'all comin' with us?
- Mr. Peterson.

779
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:27,565
Why don't you come on
our boat with Mr. Bond.

780
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:03,050
Where... where is he?

781
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,892
<i>Pollard.

782
01:26:06,677 --> 01:26:09,143
Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

783
01:26:10,774 --> 01:26:12,791
<i>Where has the
other boat gone?

784
01:26:13,263 --> 01:26:15,226
- Pollard! Pollard!
- Captain Pollard!

785
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:18,238
- Pollard! Pollard!
- Cap'n Pollard!

786
01:26:18,418 --> 01:26:20,222
- Pollard!
- Captain!

787
01:26:25,565 --> 01:26:27,146
<i>Pollard!

788
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:32,919
Get some rest.

789
01:26:48,575 --> 01:26:50,780
Benjamin, what are you doing?

790
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,480
He's dead.

791
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,697
Throwing him overboard, Sir.

792
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:59,462
Look at me,
look at me Benjamin.

793
01:27:04,279 --> 01:27:08,403
No right minded sailor discards
what might yet save him.

794
01:27:19,284 --> 01:27:21,610
Listen to me, Boy,
listen to me.

795
01:27:25,652 --> 01:27:27,859
He can help us.

796
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,244
<i>My God, our heavenly...

797
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:38,727
<i>Thy creatures wait
On Thee for daily food.

798
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:58,871
So it was decided.

799
01:28:04,938 --> 01:28:07,088
We prepared the body.

800
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:12,070
<i>We removed the organs.

801
01:28:14,713 --> 01:28:17,212
Separated his
limbs from his body.

802
01:28:18,811 --> 01:28:21,845
And cut all the
flesh from the bones.

803
01:28:25,907 --> 01:28:27,680
<i>After which...

804
01:28:28,274 --> 01:28:30,197
we closed body.

805
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:33,267
And then we sewed it up...

806
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:35,562
<i>as decently as we could...

807
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,751
<i>and committed it to the sea.

808
01:28:40,446 --> 01:28:42,423
We ate the heart first.

809
01:28:50,945 --> 01:28:52,836
You judge me.

810
01:28:54,556 --> 01:28:56,190
No.

811
01:29:02,221 --> 01:29:05,128
There... there...

812
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:07,783
it's done.

813
01:29:10,222 --> 01:29:12,043
<i>It is out.

814
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:15,178
You never told anyone?

815
01:29:17,977 --> 01:29:19,058
No.

816
01:29:20,692 --> 01:29:22,529
Not even your wife?

817
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:25,910
Do you think she
could ever love me,

818
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,861
if she knew the abominations
I had committed?

819
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:31,785
Yes, she would.

820
01:29:32,478 --> 01:29:35,684
And if you had told
me this story when we met,

821
01:29:36,509 --> 01:29:39,349
I would still wear
your ring today.

822
01:29:41,058 --> 01:29:43,073
<i>The strength of that boy,

823
01:29:43,223 --> 01:29:45,514
still lives in you.

824
01:29:47,515 --> 01:29:49,398
I see that...

825
01:29:50,007 --> 01:29:51,808
even if you don't.

826
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,490
You can finish your story now,
My Love.

827
01:30:26,784 --> 01:30:28,184
<i>Look...

828
01:30:31,564 --> 01:30:33,636
<i>Sit up.

829
01:30:36,232 --> 01:30:37,440
<i>Listen.

830
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:40,042
<i>Damn thing.

831
01:30:43,088 --> 01:30:45,475
<i>We still got a few
drops of the water left.

832
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,351
<i>Don't ya quit on me,
we're goin' home.

833
01:30:53,943 --> 01:30:55,691
Do you have a family...

834
01:30:56,391 --> 01:30:58,231
back home, Mr. Chase?

835
01:30:58,266 --> 01:30:59,648
Yeah, I have wife.

836
01:31:03,497 --> 01:31:05,933
Yes, and a son or a daughter.

837
01:31:51,004 --> 01:31:53,831
Very well.

838
01:31:54,329 --> 01:31:56,129
Cap'n, we'll draw again.

839
01:31:56,295 --> 01:31:58,608
We'll do no such thing.

840
01:31:59,536 --> 01:32:02,246
- We'll draw again.
- Mr. Ramsdell,

841
01:32:03,298 --> 01:32:06,186
you will assume
command of this vessel.

842
01:32:10,965 --> 01:32:12,103
Ya got that?

843
01:32:12,153 --> 01:32:15,445
You're our cap'n,
your men need you.

844
01:32:16,542 --> 01:32:18,142
The men will be fine.

845
01:32:19,112 --> 01:32:22,559
Please. Please. Please.

846
01:32:22,923 --> 01:32:24,767
- Henry...
- Let us go again.

847
01:32:25,527 --> 01:32:27,324
It is an order.

848
01:32:28,568 --> 01:32:30,469
If you cannot do it,

849
01:32:30,567 --> 01:32:32,854
pass the pistol to another man.

850
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,189
<i>We were weeks in the Doldrums.

851
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:23,074
<i>That part of the Pacific
is more desert than ocean.

852
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:26,705
<i>The sun beating down...

853
01:33:26,743 --> 01:33:28,346
My fear...

854
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:31,167
All I could think about...

855
01:33:32,695 --> 01:33:36,349
was that everyone would die
and I'd be the last left alive.

856
01:33:37,683 --> 01:33:42,275
Well, as best as Mr. Chase could tell,
we were still 800 miles from land.

857
01:33:47,949 --> 01:33:49,399
<i>Mr. Chase.

858
01:33:57,441 --> 01:33:59,236
Cap'n Pollard.

859
01:34:01,513 --> 01:34:03,478
Very happy to see you.

860
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:06,878
Very little happiness in our survival.

861
01:34:08,232 --> 01:34:11,118
Nor in ours, Sir.

862
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:12,973
Barzillai?

863
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:16,960
The third boat?

864
01:34:18,215 --> 01:34:22,695
<i>They're gone,
they've been gone for days.

865
01:34:22,926 --> 01:34:25,346
<i>I'm afraid they're lost, Sir.

866
01:34:55,008 --> 01:34:57,797
<i>Mr. Chase, you are prepared for this.

867
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:15,886
It's just a whale.

868
01:35:19,645 --> 01:35:21,493
There! Throw the lance!

869
01:35:22,564 --> 01:35:23,543
<i>Throw it!

870
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:30,397
<i>Throw it, drown the lad!

871
01:35:41,576 --> 01:35:44,253
<i>Throw it!

872
01:35:53,097 --> 01:35:57,561
<i>Do it! Now! Throw the lance!

873
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,034
<i>Why didn't you throw it?

874
01:36:44,051 --> 01:36:45,876
You're a damn fool.

875
01:37:08,974 --> 01:37:11,842
<i>The current drew us apart...

876
01:37:12,731 --> 01:37:16,303
<i>and that was the last we would see
of Captain Pollard's whale boat.

877
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:21,262
A boat!

878
01:37:21,479 --> 01:37:23,683
<i>A boat on the forward bow!

879
01:37:49,092 --> 01:37:51,033
May god have mercy.

880
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,156
Mr. Chase.

881
01:38:38,284 --> 01:38:40,347
Father...

882
01:38:41,992 --> 01:38:44,435
don't leave me, Father.

883
01:39:34,194 --> 01:39:36,332
Hey, Sir.

884
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:41,285
Mr. Chase. Sir.
Look. Look, Sir.

885
01:39:44,949 --> 01:39:45,947
Sir.

886
01:39:46,791 --> 01:39:49,045
Look. Out there.

887
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:50,759
They're coming.

888
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:57,155
They're coming for us.

889
01:40:19,038 --> 01:40:24,126
<i>We were rescued there,
off the Isle of Más Afuera, Chile,

890
01:40:24,929 --> 01:40:27,978
<i>ninety days after the
sinking of the Essex.

891
01:40:29,332 --> 01:40:33,448
<i>They gave us some old clothes...
leathers, too.

892
01:40:34,318 --> 01:40:38,309
<i>It was hard to eat at first...
strange.

893
01:40:39,349 --> 01:40:41,139
<i>They looked after
us as best they could,

894
01:40:41,237 --> 01:40:44,438
<i>then we found a ship
that could carry us home.

895
01:40:45,278 --> 01:40:48,448
<i>That voyage took
another three months.

896
01:40:56,637 --> 01:41:00,115
<i>It looked like the whole Island
turned out to see us return.

897
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:05,654
<i>But there were no cheers...
only silence.

898
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:13,042
<i>They looked at us like we were...
apparitions... phantoms.

899
01:41:13,742 --> 01:41:18,005
<i>We'd said nothing of the
details of our survival to anyone.

900
01:41:18,065 --> 01:41:22,106
<i>But I wondered if they somehow
knew of our privations.

901
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,480
<i>Maybe they were just curious.

902
01:42:13,074 --> 01:42:15,058
I promised, didn't I?

903
01:42:23,518 --> 01:42:24,642
God.

904
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,329
Hey, Sweetie! Who is this?

905
01:42:31,087 --> 01:42:33,052
Phebe Ann.

906
01:42:37,037 --> 01:42:38,873
Phebe Ann Chase.

907
01:42:39,935 --> 01:42:41,760
It's your Daddy.

908
01:42:43,351 --> 01:42:45,196
Hey, Sweetie.

909
01:42:49,933 --> 01:42:52,364
It's your Daddy.

910
01:43:09,205 --> 01:43:11,443
<i>Of course they couldn't
leave him alone.

911
01:43:11,713 --> 01:43:14,656
<i>Mr. Chase and his wife had scarcely
walked a block towards home

912
01:43:14,733 --> 01:43:17,882
when he was stopped and made to
return to the Maritime Office.

913
01:43:19,341 --> 01:43:22,080
<i>There were business
matters still in question.

914
01:43:36,053 --> 01:43:37,717
So, to the matter...

915
01:43:42,114 --> 01:43:45,614
Due to the significant loss of
life and property on our voyage,

916
01:43:46,122 --> 01:43:48,618
it seems there will be an inquiry.

917
01:43:49,077 --> 01:43:53,510
And, as Captain and first mate, we will
be expected to give account of what happened.

918
01:43:53,968 --> 01:43:55,299
Yes, of course.

919
01:43:55,356 --> 01:44:00,038
And, having discussed this with
the ship owners and... my father,

920
01:44:01,046 --> 01:44:04,623
it is clear that full disclosure
will have ramifications...

921
01:44:05,274 --> 01:44:08,112
terrible ramifications
for whole industry.

922
01:44:09,061 --> 01:44:11,567
That a whale brought
down the Essex.

923
01:44:12,596 --> 01:44:14,888
But it's the truth.

924
01:44:22,044 --> 01:44:25,933
If the insurance houses and investors
were to start worrying about...

925
01:44:26,014 --> 01:44:28,916
sea monsters sinking ships,

926
01:44:29,236 --> 01:44:31,972
sailors drawing lots to survive...

927
01:44:33,203 --> 01:44:36,809
We are in the oil business...
all of us.

928
01:44:37,433 --> 01:44:42,936
And as in any business the probability of
success must always be greater the risk incurred.

929
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,590
So, what are you suggesting, George?

930
01:44:46,826 --> 01:44:49,033
That you say that
the ship ran aground.

931
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:52,917
- That's a lie.
- And that the men that died drowned.

932
01:44:53,341 --> 01:44:54,127
That's another lie.

933
01:44:54,177 --> 01:44:56,121
Think on it... they
will make you captain.

934
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:58,438
Oh! That pledge I
already have in writing.

935
01:44:58,545 --> 01:45:02,546
<i>Only on the condition you
bring home a ship full of oil.

936
01:45:03,809 --> 01:45:05,482
This way it's guaranteed.

937
01:45:05,688 --> 01:45:07,971
You would be a wealthy man.

938
01:45:08,117 --> 01:45:12,410
The name Chase need no longer be a
landsman's name, but an established name

939
01:45:12,445 --> 01:45:15,960
that belongs among the
great families of Nantucket.

940
01:45:16,740 --> 01:45:19,303
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

941
01:45:20,007 --> 01:45:23,189
We're asking you
to be pragmatic.

942
01:45:38,687 --> 01:45:41,498
The Essex was stoved
by a white whale.

943
01:45:41,978 --> 01:45:44,805
And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whale boats

944
01:45:44,876 --> 01:45:49,046
had to commit abominations
in order to survive.

945
01:45:49,204 --> 01:45:53,348
And on our return, we're expected
to spread barefaced lies,

946
01:45:53,702 --> 01:45:56,853
so that you,
the ship owners of Nantucket,

947
01:45:57,312 --> 01:46:00,227
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

948
01:46:01,341 --> 01:46:04,810
Well, I will not embroil the truth.

949
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:06,692
Nor should you, George.

950
01:46:26,208 --> 01:46:28,062
<i>That last time I saw him...

951
01:46:28,405 --> 01:46:29,813
Mr. Chase, Sir.

952
01:46:30,256 --> 01:46:33,813
<i>I couldn't find the right
words to say what I wanted.

953
01:46:34,677 --> 01:46:35,956
Thomas.

954
01:46:36,945 --> 01:46:38,716
<i>Perhaps there ARE no words.

955
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:44,131
I'm... I'm gonna be
on my way to Falmouth, and...

956
01:46:47,261 --> 01:46:48,928
it's...

957
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:51,365
it's... it's been an honor, Sir,

958
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:53,506
to serve with you.

959
01:46:56,768 --> 01:46:59,575
The honor has been mine,
Mr. Nickerson.

960
01:47:16,753 --> 01:47:18,470
Take it.

961
01:47:23,035 --> 01:47:24,939
Good luck out there, Thomas.

962
01:47:26,043 --> 01:47:27,748
Thank you, Sir.

963
01:47:56,632 --> 01:47:59,922
Next day George Pollard was
called before the inquiry.

964
01:48:04,466 --> 01:48:06,807
Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

965
01:48:07,346 --> 01:48:09,917
<i>All the important men
of Nantucket were there...

966
01:48:10,895 --> 01:48:13,247
<i>it was a formality.

967
01:48:13,841 --> 01:48:16,233
<i>Good day to you, Captain,
please sit down.

968
01:48:21,817 --> 01:48:23,617
<i>For the record then.

969
01:48:25,447 --> 01:48:31,069
The Essex was stoved by a white whale
12 hundred meters west of Ecuador.

970
01:48:31,135 --> 01:48:34,166
It was as if Owen Chase
himself had spoken.

971
01:48:35,830 --> 01:48:37,949
He told them the truth.

972
01:48:41,302 --> 01:48:43,896
<i>Cap'n Pollard's
conscience was clear...

973
01:48:45,001 --> 01:48:47,464
<i>but the inquiry was a sham.

974
01:48:48,952 --> 01:48:51,393
Bowed now again

975
01:48:53,441 --> 01:48:57,429
over the white whale...
they never found it.

976
01:48:58,717 --> 01:49:01,649
<i>He ran a second ship
aground off of Hawaii...

977
01:49:02,757 --> 01:49:03,971
<i>twice cursed.

978
01:49:05,562 --> 01:49:07,242
Never sailed again.

979
01:49:07,492 --> 01:49:09,141
And Owen Chase?

980
01:49:10,241 --> 01:49:12,286
He was a man
of his word.

981
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:15,688
First, he sent a boat back to Ducie Island.

982
01:49:16,752 --> 01:49:18,591
Mr. Joy had passed...

983
01:49:18,854 --> 01:49:22,362
but the other three were
incredibly still alive.

984
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:26,489
And then?

985
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,600
Then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford...

986
01:49:32,592 --> 01:49:34,227
<i>to start over...

987
01:49:34,702 --> 01:49:36,744
<i>in a merchant...

988
01:49:37,009 --> 01:49:39,396
<i>sailing his own terms.

989
01:49:48,618 --> 01:49:52,086
<i>Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, Mr. Melville.

990
01:49:52,338 --> 01:49:54,725
These February nights are
the longest of the year.

991
01:49:55,015 --> 01:49:58,078
- Well, you can both rest now.
- Leave me...

992
01:49:58,384 --> 01:50:01,251
I shall not be
resting for some time.

993
01:50:01,507 --> 01:50:02,938
<i>Why?

994
01:50:03,653 --> 01:50:08,824
Ya got your story there,
and your plot is all there.

995
01:50:08,874 --> 01:50:12,605
Maybe it wasn't a
plot I was after.

996
01:50:12,755 --> 01:50:14,815
No, what then?

997
01:50:14,990 --> 01:50:17,495
Something else you've
given me tonight.

998
01:50:17,545 --> 01:50:19,052
What is that?

999
01:50:19,636 --> 01:50:24,328
The courage to go where...
one does not want to go.

1000
01:50:25,747 --> 01:50:27,589
Mr. Melville,

1001
01:50:27,874 --> 01:50:30,928
what you've heard,
what I've told you,

1002
01:50:33,602 --> 01:50:38,090
will it all be of
service to your book?

1003
01:50:39,189 --> 01:50:42,785
It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,

1004
01:50:43,933 --> 01:50:45,851
inspired by truth,

1005
01:50:46,973 --> 01:50:50,576
but I don't believe I'll feel
the need to use all of it.

1006
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:00,662
- Thank you.
- Here...

1007
01:51:01,141 --> 01:51:02,359
take that with you.

1008
01:51:02,418 --> 01:51:04,766
No, the money is for you,
I insist.

1009
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,160
I insist you keep it.

1010
01:51:07,504 --> 01:51:12,055
And I insist that one person
in this conversation is sober.

1011
01:51:22,201 --> 01:51:25,227
So, it's back to Pittsfield,
Massachusetts.

1012
01:51:25,751 --> 01:51:28,319
Well, good luck.

1013
01:51:29,422 --> 01:51:30,680
Thank you.

1014
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:35,551
Ya know...

1015
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:39,755
<i>I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently,

1016
01:51:40,537 --> 01:51:42,264
and found oil.

1017
01:51:42,734 --> 01:51:44,577
That can't be true.

1018
01:51:45,052 --> 01:51:46,579
I heard it, too.

1019
01:51:48,373 --> 01:51:51,399
Oil from ground.

1020
01:51:52,501 --> 01:51:54,943
Fancy that.
