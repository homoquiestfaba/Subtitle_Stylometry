1
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,006
I love you.

2
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,134
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

3
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:57,879
Will you marry me?

4
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,276
Baby...

5
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:04,316
Baby...

6
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:07,448
Baby, your breath smells
like dog food.

7
00:01:08,994 --> 00:01:11,360
Just a hint of Rottweiler butt.

8
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:13,654
You're on notice, Rocco.

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,629
When Felicia moves in,
you have to clean up your act.

10
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:18,959
Bon appêtit.

11
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:12,187
I have a very big surprise
for you.

12
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,483
A very big surprise.

13
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:19,088
I know you're dying to know, I won't
tell you, no matter how much you beg.

14
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,122
No. Not even a hint.

15
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:37,274
Wow, this is incredible, Jerry.
What 's this all about?

16
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,617
Felicia, from the first moment
I met you, I...

17
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:49,084
I mean... from the first moment
I saw you...

18
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,454
- What I'm trying to say, Felicia...
- You look sick all of a sudden.

19
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:55,030
Are you alright?

20
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,201
Motion sickness.

21
00:02:57,402 --> 00:03:02,066
The reason why I brought you
up here is to tell you...

22
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:05,071
...to say...
- Yes?

23
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:08,903
- To ask, to communicate...
- Just spit it out.

24
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:15,312
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't mean it!

25
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,114
Don't cover me in puke
and try and call me baby.

26
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,382
I'll make it up to you, Felicia.

27
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,752
- Will you marry me?
- No.

28
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,128
Thank you. You made me
the happiest... What?

29
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,895
- I met someone.
- Met someone?

30
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,070
Andrê and I have all the things
that we don't, Jerry.

31
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,068
- Andrê?
- I introduced you once.

32
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:37,867
He details my BMW.

33
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:41,910
You dump me for a guy who goes to
work in a jumpsuit and rubber boots?

34
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:46,709
Andrê and I connect on a level
that you and I just never could.

35
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:49,716
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

36
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,601
She dumped us, Rocco.

37
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:08,099
I know you don't care.
You can lick your own balls.

38
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:50,944
<i>I' m not in. Leave a message</i>,
<i>or don't leave a message. Whatever</i>.

39
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,549
<i>Hello Jerry</i>,<i>it's me</i>.
<i>Pick up</i>.

40
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:55,844
<i>Dude</i>,<i>I know you're there</i>.

41
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,522
<i>Come on</i>,<i>quit acting like</i>
<i>a little kid. You're so immature</i>.

42
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,185
Pick up now, or I'm gonna fart
into the phone.

43
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,895
Leave me alone.
I'm wallowing in self-pity.

44
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,891
It 's time to rejoin the living, Jerry.
Come on, we're going out tonight.

45
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,467
- Not interested.
- Saddle up dough, baloney pony.

46
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,106
It 's operation "Storm in the Foxholes".
China Club, 21:OO hours.

47
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:18,673
<i>Ourobjective?</i>
<i>Penetrate the enemy</i>.

48
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:21,743
- Stop calling me. I'm not going.
<i>- This is nonnegotiable</i>,<i>Jerry</i>.

49
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,210
Either meet me tonight,
or I'm gonna ask out your sister.

50
00:05:24,415 --> 00:05:27,009
And you know she'll go 'cause she's
freaky like that. We both know her.

51
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:30,517
- Hang up. The toilet 's stuffed up.
- I gotta go, there's an emergency.

52
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:32,952
I gotta go. See ya.

53
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:47,035
Thanks for fitting me in today,
Daniel. I'm so tight.

54
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,844
Go really deep this time.

55
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,689
Give it to me harder.

56
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,526
Harder.

57
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,836
Harder.

58
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,946
Harder.

59
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:38,681
Come on, Daniel.
Is this the best you can do?

60
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:46,491
Ragoni, what the hell
are you doing?

61
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,166
I was just warming up for you.

62
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:59,236
- Marshall, is that you?
- Nick!

63
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:02,379
Hey! Long time no see.
How you doing?

64
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,777
You've got to give me the name
of your new escort service.

65
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,245
Cut it out, Nick.

66
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:10,819
This is my fiancêe. Sheri.
She ain't no escort skank.

67
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:13,684
- She and I are in love.
- That 's right.

68
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,918
Marshall here is the most interesting
and exciting man I've ever met.

69
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,361
- And he's a wonderful lover.
- Oh, I get it, she's retarded.

70
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,899
Actually she's one of the sharpest
bartenders at Hooters.

71
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:29,733
Marshy. Excuse me, fellas. I'm going
to attend to the landing strip.

72
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:35,308
- And classy, too.
- We met on a cruise.

73
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,376
There's just something
about the ocean air, the sun.

74
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,246
It really makes it easier to meet
people. We connected right away.

75
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:43,920
Very first night.

76
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:47,347
- With her? Very first night?
- Yes!

77
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:51,254
There are dozens of women
just as friendly as her on board.

78
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:53,555
Dude, I gotta tell ya.
Whatever you're doing...

79
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,825
take a week off and get yourself
on one of those boats.

80
00:07:57,034 --> 00:08:01,494
There's a line at the can.
Honey, can we skip dinner?

81
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:06,439
You look so hot you got me
in the mood for a takeout in bed.

82
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,048
Tongue.

83
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,754
Wow.

84
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,723
Wasn't that crazy Marshall Geller who
worked in our high school cafeteria?

85
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:34,871
Nope. That was crazy Marshall
Geller, my new personal hero.

86
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,664
Dude, let 's bolt.

87
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:39,775
Hanging around some stupid bar
is no place to meet women.

88
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,003
What are you talking about? You've
begged me to come here for months!

89
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:45,011
Jerry, buddy...

90
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,141
trust me...

91
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:50,548
I have seen the light.

92
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,577
Son of a bitch!

93
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,211
That was my space!

94
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,856
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you right back, buddy!

95
00:09:27,058 --> 00:09:29,754
Back off. I don't wanna see an out
of shape slob get his butt kicked.

96
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:31,986
- He ain't that out of shape.
- I'm talking about you!

97
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,788
You break a sweat
changing your shoes.

98
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:36,330
- Stop. Bite me!
- Blow me!

99
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,365
- Kiss my ass!
- Fuck your mother!

100
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh, yeah? No one would want to fuck
my mother 'cause she's too ugly.

101
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,803
- I think I lost that one, didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.

102
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,614
Okay. That 's the 7-day, 6-night
fun in the sun singles package...

103
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:54,182
with the standard 3 to 1
female to male ratio.

104
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:58,011
Just as the doctor ordered,
right, buddy?

105
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,656
I don't know, Nick.
I don't think I'm ready for this.

106
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:03,622
Not ready? Come on.
It 's been six months.

107
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,728
I don't like the sun...

108
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,693
and I get seasick.

109
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,892
I don't know what to say
to strange women.

110
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:13,969
We're not going for the discourse.
We're going for the intercourse.

111
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:17,732
Sex! That 's all you ever think about.
Sex, sex, sex!

112
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,665
We'll take it.

113
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:21,768
There you go.

114
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,675
Larry, you're still here.

115
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:29,980
- Your mother died.
- What?

116
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,985
- When?
- This morning. I'm sorry.

117
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,887
- I thought you got my Post-it.
- Okay, thanks, Michael.

118
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,994
Alright. Now, gentlemen...

119
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:42,927
I might want you to consider this
stateroom. It 's a little bit larger...

120
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,369
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

121
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,042
Help!

122
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:57,771
Mama, no!

123
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,246
- You!
- Fuck you, pal.

124
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,012
- Fuck you back.
- Fuck your mother.

125
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:09,181
- No one would fuck my mother...
- We've been through this before!

126
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,059
Excuse me. What seems to be
the problem here?

127
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,389
This guy. Pecker face.

128
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:15,327
- That 's the problem
- This guy's a jerk.

129
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,899
Alright, Brian, you know what?
Enough. Let me handle this.

130
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:20,468
- You go check on the ski packages.
- Yeah. Fuck off.

131
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,366
- Ski over near the Maui getaways.
- Yeah.

132
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:24,973
- Remember? Since the changeover?
- Yeah, I got it.

133
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,409
I am so sorry.

134
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,204
Brian's had a little problem
with the...

135
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:32,576
And the... and the... and the...

136
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,083
Yeah, bad news.
But now he's doing fine.

137
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:41,054
He's doing a lot of great work
with unwed teenage mothers.

138
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,824
So... Alright.

139
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:49,259
Let 's see... 7-day, 6-night
vacation cruise. Is that correct?

140
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,230
- That 's the one.
- Right.

141
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:54,802
Yeah, right. Okay.

142
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:01,612
You guys are set, gentlemen.

143
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:05,475
I think you'll have a very good time.
Please enjoy your vacation.

144
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,741
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

145
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,578
Hey, and you should probably
do something about that guy.

146
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:11,046
Don't worry,
I've already taken care of it.

147
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:13,883
And, hey...

148
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:17,925
- I'm a letter writer.
- Duly noted.

149
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:19,994
Alright.

150
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,631
Bye-bye, now.

151
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:27,698
I'm too upset to work ski packages.

152
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:31,602
- I can't believe you took care of them.
- I took care of them alright.

153
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,069
'Cause no one calls
my little pecker a pecker.

154
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:39,110
- Huh?
- Yeah.

155
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,619
Wow! Look at the size
of that thing!

156
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,890
And just think,
it 's filled with available women.

157
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,828
Yeah! And here's the beauty part
of the whole thing.

158
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:59,901
They can't get away from us.
We'll be in the middle of the ocean.

159
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:04,006
They can try, but they'll drown
or be eaten by sharks. It 's perfect.

160
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:08,874
Sometimes I think there's something
seriously wrong with you.

161
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,139
I can live with that.

162
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:15,716
- Excuse me. Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

163
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,582
- You board everybody on this ship?
- Yes, sir.

164
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,320
Let me ask you a question,
from guy to guy.

165
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,684
Is there a lot of sweet ass
on this ship?

166
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,919
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

167
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,893
- Yes! Right, Jerry?
- Yeah!

168
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,329
Alrighty!

169
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:34,734
And all filled with hot,
beautiful women!

170
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,469
- Yes!
- Awesome, awesome, awesome!

171
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:43,670
Think of the sexiest creatures
boarding this love boat as we speak!

172
00:13:49,987 --> 00:13:52,979
- Alright, this is great!
- Yeah, you know!

173
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,288
- Hello!
- Hey! What 's up, guys?

174
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,225
How you doin'?

175
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:01,055
Alright!

176
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:03,392
- Lovely boat, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,831
Don't you ever doubt me.

178
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,271
What the hell was that?

179
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,814
Well, onboard entertainment.

180
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:24,078
You know? I bet Cirque du Soleil
is here. Like Vegas.

181
00:14:24,288 --> 00:14:26,620
- Cool.
- Right?

182
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,421
Hey, how are ya?

183
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,735
There it is. Stateroom 211.

184
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:44,430
The number that 'll be on every
woman's lips by the end of the trip.

185
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,270
Let 's do it.

186
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,776
That 's weird.

187
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,882
Only one bed.

188
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,186
I know why.

189
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,292
We're going to have so much sex one
guy's always going to sleep out.

190
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,619
Yeah, right.

191
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,889
You better hope that couch
is more comfortable than it looks.

192
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,961
There's a mirror on the ceiling.

193
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,132
Excelente.

194
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:19,036
That way the babes can watch me
get my peak on.

195
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,245
Check this out, Jer.

196
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:24,914
- Four racquetball courts.
- Hey!

197
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:29,518
- Nine cocktail lounges, a casino.
- Six and eight 's a running mate!

198
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,412
A video arcade...

199
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:34,318
Onboard chest waxing salon...

200
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:39,621
- Chest waxing?
- Yes, of course, for swimming.

201
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:41,993
Let me see that.

202
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,094
Club Socrates wants you to know
you'll be treated like a queen.

203
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:52,868
- You mean king?
- Queen. It says so right there.

204
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,972
That 's weird.

205
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:03,214
Hello?
Ring, ring, ring.

206
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:06,582
Everybody conga.

207
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:12,126
<i>Conga</i>,<i>conga</i>,<i>conga</i>,<i>everybody party</i>
<i>Party</i>,<i>party</i>,<i>party</i>

208
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,058
<i>Five o'clock today</i>

209
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,497
Yeah, baby! I told you, Jer.
This boat is wild!

210
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:24,703
- Where's the party, sweet thing?
<i>- Stateroom 209. Stateroom 209</i>.

211
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,835
It 's casual.

212
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,454
To fresh scratches on our backs.

213
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,423
- Scotch and soda, please.
- Coming right up, sir.

214
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,098
Oh, please.

215
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,566
Why do they always
have to play Liza?

216
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:56,740
I don't know.
I kinda like "Liza With a Z".

217
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:59,307
Yeah, it 's kind of cool
for making out.

218
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:03,440
I prefer Johnny Mathis, myself.

219
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,242
Yeah, if you're gonna
make out with a dude.

220
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,488
That is very funny.

221
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,294
My name is Faversham.
Lloyd Faversham.

222
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,257
- Nick Ragoni.
- Nick.

223
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:20,589
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

224
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,891
- Is this your first cruise?
- No, my third.

225
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,159
- And you?
- Numero uno.

226
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:31,033
Then you are going to positively
adore it. It is one wild...

227
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,801
...decadent week.
- That 's why we're here, right?

228
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,945
- All night parties.
- Excellent.

229
00:17:36,146 --> 00:17:39,172
- Midnight skinny dipping.
- Sign me up!

230
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:44,184
And if you're into it,
lots of sex, sex... sex.

231
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,822
You hear that, Jer?
All the sex a man could want.

232
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,590
Well, then you must visit
the hole in one room.

233
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:53,524
Oh? They have an onboard
driving range?

234
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:58,225
Some of the chaps down there
do swing some very large clubs.

235
00:17:59,236 --> 00:18:02,364
You two have an open relationship?

236
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,507
Open? What do you mean
by "open relationship"?

237
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,370
- I mean do you date?
- Of course we date.

238
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,011
- That 's why we're here.
- Yeah.

239
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,976
That 's absolutely wonderful.

240
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:14,617
We must get together sometime.
Go for a midnight swim.

241
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:16,945
Do whatever feels right.

242
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:20,681
That is what a gay cruise
is all about.

243
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:26,721
I see.

244
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,023
Hear that, Jerry?

245
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,691
We can do whatever we want.
Whatever feels right.

246
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,997
That 's what a gay cruise
is all about.

247
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,675
Whatever we want to do,
we can do it...

248
00:18:39,877 --> 00:18:41,970
because it 's a gay cruise.

249
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,740
It 's a gay cruise, Jerry,
not a bi-cruise. It 's a gay cruise!

250
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,383
Capital G, capital A,
capital YMCA gay cruise, Jerry!

251
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:54,056
Damn, damn, damn!

252
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,893
I wonder how many other people
made the same mistake I did.

253
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:04,656
No one! Shit! Jerry!
Don't worry, buddy!

254
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:07,962
I'm bringing you back home! I'm gonna
get you out of here! Let 's go!

255
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:14,406
Help! Help! Somebody help us!

256
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,273
We're straight! We're straight.

257
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:23,716
Hey, Nick! Stop acting like a jerk!
We'll figure this out!

258
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:26,913
What are we gonna do, Jerry?
We gotta get off this boat!

259
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,649
Excuse me sir, do you know
where we can get off real quick?

260
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,124
- Try the hole in one room.
- I'm starting to think that 's...

261
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:35,423
not a real driving range, Jer.
In fact, I'm convinced of it.

262
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,930
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

263
00:19:38,202 --> 00:19:40,966
We're trapped like rats!

264
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:46,407
What?

265
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,475
I checked our itinerary.

266
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:50,943
We don't dock for four days.

267
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,446
Why do I ever listen to you?

268
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,880
Are you implying
that this is somehow my fault?

269
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,384
I'm not implying it.
I'm saying it.

270
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:01,983
If you hadn't insulted the travel agent,
none of this would've happened.

271
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,522
- Maybe there's another explanation.
- Yeah? What?

272
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,327
Maybe that travel agent thought
he was doing you a favor.

273
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:11,967
Because...

274
00:20:12,636 --> 00:20:14,661
- You know.
- Because what?

275
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:16,931
Because you're a little fem.
That 's why.

276
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,735
You always dress real nice.
You're in shape. You're neat.

277
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:22,537
And you use those pastel
colored balls at the bowling alley.

278
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:25,180
Don't think that got past me.

279
00:20:29,153 --> 00:20:32,350
You're an idiot.
A thick-headed moron.

280
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:35,457
Felicia was right. I should've
dumped your ass years ago!

281
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,287
If you wanted to dump somebody's
ass, it should've been Felicia's.

282
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:42,291
That chick was Satan's sister, bro.
Yeah! Devil in a d-cup!

283
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,194
Felicia was as frosty a bitch
as I've ever seen in my life!

284
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,835
I'm gonna kill ya!

285
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:49,128
Get off.

286
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:53,538
I know I heard
do the bump-bump time.

287
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:57,442
Hey you, don't get the wrong idea.

288
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,811
Hector always gets the wrong idea.

289
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:02,715
That 's why he is no longer welcome
in the state of Missouri.

290
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:06,183
Buddy, you pranced into the wrong
cabin. My friend and I...

291
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,088
we're not gay.

292
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:13,728
Ring, ring. Hold the phone. What you
tell me? You two guys are not gay?

293
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,330
That 's right!

294
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:19,527
Go on, pull Hector's other leg.
He's got bells on it.

295
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,831
I'm getting out of here.

296
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,842
Gee. What hasn't gotten into him?

297
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:31,874
Out.

298
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,811
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

299
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:36,008
<i>Watch out</i>,<i>boy</i>
<i>He'll chew you up</i>

300
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,949
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

301
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:39,884
<i>He's a maneater</i>

302
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,516
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

303
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:44,751
<i>Watch out</i>,<i>boy</i>
<i>He'll chew you up</i>

304
00:21:44,962 --> 00:21:46,486
<i>Oh</i>,<i>here he comes</i>

305
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:48,927
<i>He's a maneater</i>

306
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:51,531
<i>lwouldn't if lwere you</i>

307
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:03,009
Bachelor number 2. What 's the most
unusual place you ever made love?

308
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:07,650
Well, once I did it in a dressing
room in International Male.

309
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:10,411
Right. How about you,
bachelor number 3?

310
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:13,353
What 's the most unusual place
that you ever made love?

311
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:15,788
Inside a woman.

312
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:19,361
Oh, no...

313
00:22:24,368 --> 00:22:28,202
Hey! Who do I have to screw
to get a drink around here?

314
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,098
Oops.

315
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,438
Oops.

316
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:39,148
Hey buddy, you okay?

317
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,818
Do I look gay?

318
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,419
Never saw an old gay
grandpa before.

319
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,695
Where are all the gay people at?

320
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:01,564
You're all always supposed
to want to party.

321
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:04,935
Oops. Oops.

322
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:39,470
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

323
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:54,283
<i>Men on dates</i>,<i>holding hands</i>,
<i>touching</i>,<i>kissing</i>.

324
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:58,791
<i>I can't take it. Then I think</i>
<i>"not delay it."</i>

325
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:01,259
<i>Took too much shop</i>
<i>in high school</i>.

326
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,064
Help! Pick me up!

327
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,439
Get me out of here!

328
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,109
Drop down a ladder!

329
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:17,436
I like girls!

330
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,623
Please!

331
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:31,919
Please, come back!

332
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:11,665
I don't know anything about a flare
gun. I swear I was here all night.

333
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:15,133
A flare gun? I don't know anything.
I was here all night.

334
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:18,201
Flare gun? I don't know nothing
about no stinking flare gun.

335
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:22,009
- Oh, shit!
- Okay.

336
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,706
Here we are.
You should go change now.

337
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:28,612
Where's your robe?

338
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,514
Okay.

339
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:33,312
Okay, I give up.
I did it.

340
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:37,115
Hey, Jer, how was your evening?

341
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:41,527
Hi. Your friend
had a little too much to drink.

342
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:43,426
She thinks I'm drunk.

343
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,434
- Nicky, Nicky!
- Alright, alright.

344
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:49,503
I fell in the pool.

345
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,135
- You're sitting on my balls!
- Okay...

346
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,776
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

347
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,938
- Good night.
- You're getting me all wet.

348
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,652
Jerry!

349
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,847
Wake up, I'm starving!

350
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,318
Come on, Jerry!

351
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:14,358
Dude, don't make me go up there
by myself. Get up.

352
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:16,861
Jerry!

353
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,590
Screw it.

354
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,265
What am I afraid of?
How gay can a buffet be?

355
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:54,661
Is this seat taken?

356
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:56,463
- Actually...
- I hate dining alone.

357
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:59,039
- I bet you feel the same way too.
- I'm okay with it, actually.

358
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,338
I see you took the omelette,
the waffles and the flapjacks.

359
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:08,211
Hungry little man, aren't you?
Do you care for a bite of my sausage?

360
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,683
In England, we call them bangers.

361
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,017
Captain, can you come over here
a minute, please?

362
00:27:16,693 --> 00:27:20,356
There's a small craft off the starboard
trying to get our attention.

363
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:25,593
- Help!
- Help us!

364
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:28,896
- Help!
- Somebody save us!

365
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,507
Jesus...

366
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:36,338
Sound the alarm.
All hands on dick... deck.

367
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:38,838
Deck!

368
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:48,382
Tea?

369
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,325
For you.

370
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,939
Oh, my God.

371
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:12,205
- I must be dreaming. Pinch me.
- Sure. My pleasure.

372
00:28:12,415 --> 00:28:15,145
- I didn't say on my ass.
- You didn't not say it.

373
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:19,413
I didn't think
I had to specify. Jesus.

374
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,590
Nick, Nick.
Look, you gotta help me out.

375
00:28:26,796 --> 00:28:28,764
Remember that woman that dragged
me into the room last night?

376
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,126
I can't get her off my mind.

377
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:34,460
She kissed me. Technically it was
mouth to mouth. But it was fabulous.

378
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,697
I mean, I gotta find her.
I mean I was so wasted...

379
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,671
- Who are they?
- The answer to our prayers.

380
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,314
Twelve of the most gorgeous
creatures I've ever seen.

381
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:50,111
But I'm not greedy.
I'll share.

382
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,050
Go ahead, pick... two.

383
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,593
No. This girl's fabulous.
She's special.

384
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:00,558
I gotta find her.

385
00:29:05,802 --> 00:29:07,463
She's special. Special.

386
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,376
Hello.

387
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:21,141
- Hi.
- Who are you?

388
00:29:21,351 --> 00:29:24,218
I'm Nick Ragoni, the most grateful
man on the planet.

389
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:27,015
I'm Inga. Very pleasurable
to meet you.

390
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,484
How'd you all get here?

391
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,883
We are the Swedish sun
tanning team...

392
00:29:31,094 --> 00:29:34,120
on our way to the Hawaiian
Tropics Tanning Competition.

393
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,821
Some bonehead shot down
our helicopter.

394
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,524
Coach had to make water landing.

395
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,569
I didn't think this would happen
until I died and went to heaven.

396
00:29:43,106 --> 00:29:46,200
It 's a lucky thing we were picked
up by a boat full of homo boys.

397
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,207
It would be terrible to have
straight men hassling and ogling us...

398
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,404
while we're trying to work on
our even tan lines.

399
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:57,046
You're so right.

400
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,745
Lucky I'm gay!

401
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:04,020
I'm super gay! I'm mega...
I'm gay enormous!

402
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,421
I'm so gay!
But that 's good.

403
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:12,761
'Cause now you guys can all feel
comfortable in front of me...

404
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:16,029
and take off your tops and stuff.

405
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,532
And I can do this for you.

406
00:30:18,742 --> 00:30:22,473
I can put tanning oils
and creamy lotions...

407
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:25,739
all over your luscious bodies.

408
00:30:26,716 --> 00:30:32,348
And there won't be any worries
for you because I'm so gay!

409
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:41,795
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!
Almost finished!

410
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:48,330
Okay, let 's do the back.

411
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:52,634
The first time I think
I realized I was gay...

412
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:56,005
was when I was around twelve
in Scouts.

413
00:30:56,246 --> 00:30:58,237
I really liked putting on
that kerchief.

414
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:01,713
In fact, it was the only part
I liked about it.

415
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:03,813
That and the nude swimming.

416
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,979
Anyway, I hope you gals
all feel comfortable around me.

417
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,085
"Ja", Nick.

418
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:13,353
'Cause I sure do feel comfortable
around you.

419
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:18,265
All done. Who's next?
How about you, Ursula?

420
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:22,837
Ready for your second coat?
These thighs look a little dry.

421
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:25,037
There we go.

422
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:28,501
What do you want?

423
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,747
What the hell is that?

424
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:36,180
I got this from that dude
over there. He's hot.

425
00:31:36,386 --> 00:31:41,790
You are no gay homo man.
I am Sonya, coach of tanning team.

426
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:43,253
- What?
- Quiet!

427
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:44,983
As long as these women
are in training...

428
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:49,154
there will be no trouser snakes
near their hot luscious popos.

429
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,389
Put me down!

430
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,625
Coach of the tanning team.
That 's ridiculous.

431
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,997
If I want to talk
to any of these ladies, I will.

432
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:58,436
And there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop me.

433
00:31:58,641 --> 00:31:59,630
Oh, yeah?

434
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:11,749
What the hell happened to you?

435
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:14,116
I died and went to heaven.

436
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:17,384
And then some muscle bound blonde
dwarf knocked me back down to hell.

437
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:20,222
- What?
- You know those 12 gorgeous hotties?

438
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,762
They've got
a goddamn bodyguard.

439
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,931
I can take disappointments, Jer.

440
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:32,699
But little Mickey's already known
such heartache in a short life.

441
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,173
Well then I guess all three of us
struck out.

442
00:32:35,845 --> 00:32:37,904
I still can't find that girl.

443
00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:40,241
I've looked everywhere.

444
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,146
You know, I've kissed
Felicia for four years...

445
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:46,652
and never felt anything like
I felt last night.

446
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,952
That girl is special.
I gotta find her.

447
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,022
You're abandoning me?
What am I supposed to do?

448
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:59,031
This is a luxury cruise!
Not everything's gay-oriented.

449
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:01,260
No more bets.

450
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:04,298
Red three is the winner.

451
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:11,179
Beautiful. Poker.
This is gonna be sweet.

452
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:14,916
These trouser pilots are no match
for a lusty hetero like myself.

453
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,882
This will be like taking candy
from a baby.

454
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,681
Why is that?
Are gay men notorious bad gamblers?

455
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,051
Awful. They can't bluff.

456
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,159
They look at the cards,
they start giggling. Terrible.

457
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:30,321
Promise me you won't act like a gay
bashing narrow minded Neanderthal.

458
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,228
Jerry, buddy, you're talking to me.

459
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:36,638
- Lady, couple of clubs, pass a flush...
- Hello gays... guys.

460
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:39,475
- Mind if I join you?
- Sure thing, gorgeous.

461
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:43,545
I can't remember.
Does a straight beat a flush?

462
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:46,945
Damn! I really thought
I had this one.

463
00:33:47,617 --> 00:33:49,050
Listen, Nick.

464
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,753
I don't want you to take offense, but
can I give you a piece of advice?

465
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:55,388
- What?
- Don't clear your throat.

466
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,224
What?

467
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:59,987
Every time you bluff,
you clear your throat.

468
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:01,629
I do?

469
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:05,363
Don't play the cards.
Play the players.

470
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,165
Right. Here we go.

471
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:10,999
Any up.
Five or shoot. Three card Monty.

472
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:14,176
King is to win. There you go.
There's a winner!

473
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:15,708
We got a winner!

474
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:28,849
Hey you.

475
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:33,656
Unbelievable.

476
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:37,695
That was embarrassing!

477
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,926
They offer a pool safety class onboard.
You should check it out.

478
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,204
Let me give you a hand.

479
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,234
I'm Gabriella.

480
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:51,677
I'm Jerry.

481
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,746
Oh, boy.

482
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:05,017
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:06,655
You like?

484
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,725
Oh, yeah.

485
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:12,457
Ice cream?
Yeah, that 's okay.

486
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:15,398
Coach would kill me if she knew
I broke training.

487
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:19,964
But I no can help. I am...
What is the word?

488
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,907
- Oral.
- That 's the word.

489
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:25,905
And what a wonderful word it is.

490
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:28,774
I'm so lonely.

491
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:33,820
Coach's very strict about keeping us
away from men during tanning season.

492
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,891
It 's too bad you're gay, Nick.

493
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,458
- Good night.
- Inga, wait, wait.

494
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,026
I've always been curious
about your country.

495
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:44,199
- Mind if I ask you something?
- Yeah.

496
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,265
What would you like
to know about, Nick?

497
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:51,168
Our cities, our lakes and rivers,
our safe and sturdy automobiles?

498
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:55,071
I'm a big fan of your cinema.
I've rented quite a bit of it.

499
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:59,374
I've noticed your people's progressive
attitude towards premarital sex.

500
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:04,851
So I was wondering, theoretically,
if my own sexual orientation were...

501
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:08,455
If you're asking if I'd sleep with you if
you were straight the answer is "Ja".

502
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,126
- "Ja"? "Ja" means "Yes", right?
- Ja!

503
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,522
Inga, I have a surprise for you.
I'm straight.

504
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:18,029
I'm as straight as a Volvo going
down an Oslo toll road.

505
00:36:18,234 --> 00:36:22,728
- But Oslo is in Norway.
- The point is... we can make love.

506
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:25,900
I know that 's the best news
I've ever heard.

507
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,078
I'm cabin 4433.
Meet me in five minuten.

508
00:36:29,278 --> 00:36:31,872
You got it. Five minuten.

509
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:35,742
And not a minuten more.

510
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:39,052
Hello. Are there any condoms
available on this ship?

511
00:36:44,393 --> 00:36:46,759
Come in. Door is open.

512
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,759
Coach.

513
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:56,633
Changing room assignments.
You bunk with Pia.

514
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,808
- But why, coach?
- You cannot be trusted with minibar.

515
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,206
- You are in training.
- But coach, I eat nothing all day.

516
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:05,607
You ate yesterday, ja?

517
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:08,682
Your butt is disgusting.
I better double check.

518
00:37:10,052 --> 00:37:12,577
Ja, disgusting.

519
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:14,312
Both cheeks.

520
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:19,760
Ja, ja, ja. Move it, fattie.

521
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:22,453
- Knock it off and go to bed.
- Alright, coach.

522
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,430
Thank you for lending me
your jacket.

523
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,597
- So, what do you do on this ship?
- I'm a dance teacher.

524
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:33,707
- Wow. Teaching dance must be fun.
- It can be.

525
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,873
Especially on the gay cruises.

526
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:38,103
They're much more fun
than the straight ones.

527
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:39,144
Why is that?

528
00:37:39,348 --> 00:37:42,249
The guys that go on the straight
cruises... all you meet are these...

529
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:46,182
...horny creeps.
- Oh, I got a friend like that.

530
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,016
I bet men hit on you all the time.

531
00:37:51,627 --> 00:37:54,221
You've got a hot ass.

532
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:56,020
Excuse me?

533
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,159
Your ass. It 's hot.

534
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,559
Thanks.

535
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,509
Your butt 's nothing
to sneeze at, either.

536
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,278
So...

537
00:38:11,847 --> 00:38:14,179
...you must have a boyfriend.
- No, no, no.

538
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:15,748
- No boyfriend.
- Really?

539
00:38:15,952 --> 00:38:16,884
Why not?

540
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:21,955
Every boyfriend I've ever had has
turned out to be a son of a bitch.

541
00:38:22,124 --> 00:38:24,854
- Well, not every guy is a...
- I know what you're thinking.

542
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,323
I just never met "the right guy".

543
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:29,828
Trust me, honey. I've met every type
out there and it 's pretty bad.

544
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:33,795
Liars, guys with two wives,
guys with commitment issues...

545
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:38,440
guys with parole issues.
You name it, I've dated them all.

546
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:40,905
Which is why I'm so relieved
to be on this boat.

547
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,011
There's not one
straight man in sight.

548
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:46,078
- Excuse me?
- It 's so great...

549
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,342
because I can really be myself.
I don't care about makeup...

550
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:51,213
I don't care about what
I'm wearing...

551
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,445
if a guy is talking to me because
he wants to get into my pants...

552
00:38:53,656 --> 00:38:55,920
- Gabriella...
- You know what else?

553
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,650
Let 's say I do get horny one day.

554
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:03,764
Maybe I can even find a gay guy
and he can do me the favor.

555
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,129
- The favor?
- How do you say in English?

556
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:12,706
Make me scream, make me moan.
Screw my brains out.

557
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:19,442
I don't mean to be a bitch...

558
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:26,117
but these staterooms
could use a bit more color.

559
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,821
Now we are laying down to sleep.

560
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:33,462
Our hot tight bodies
the Lord will keep.

561
00:39:39,602 --> 00:39:42,503
Inga darling, it 's me, Nicky.

562
00:39:42,705 --> 00:39:45,196
I'm here.

563
00:39:52,882 --> 00:39:57,114
Reverend Lindstrom, "nej".

564
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,721
Just think of what
would the bishop say.

565
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,449
Who's knocking at my doors?

566
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,956
Oh, my God!

567
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:11,326
Let 's go downtown, baby.

568
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:18,663
Help me, Jesus!

569
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,172
I don't want to die!

570
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:44,329
"Nej, nej, nej.
Ja, ja, ja, ja."

571
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,433
Get off me!

572
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,968
What 's that?

573
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:58,203
It 's coming from the coach's room.

574
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:03,977
Smoking sturgeons!
Coach's pussy just blew up.

575
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,514
It was good for me, ja.

576
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,669
Oh, Jesus.

577
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,640
<i>I gotta tell you</i>,<i>Nick</i>.
<i>She's so great</i>.

578
00:41:58,841 --> 00:42:02,641
We had so much fun.
We talked, we laughed.

579
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:05,473
Can you hand me one of those
cheese-flavored penises?

580
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,544
Gabriella is everything I've ever
wanted in a woman. I even pierced...

581
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:12,277
...my ear for her.
- You better make sure...

582
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,218
...it 's the right ear.
- Of course it 's...

583
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:23,226
- Yeah, I better look into that.
- How was your evening?

584
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:26,629
Let 's just say I had some bad
shellfish and leave it at that.

585
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,236
- Hey. Hold on a second. See ya.
- Here she comes.

586
00:42:29,572 --> 00:42:31,301
- Grab my ass.
- What are you? Crazy?

587
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,340
I told her I was gay. Now wet
your lips and look at me lovingly.

588
00:42:34,543 --> 00:42:36,135
- Do I look like a homo to you?
- Yes.

589
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,869
An out of shape one,
but we have those too.

590
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,243
Thank you very much. That 's enough.
Moving along. Nothing to see here.

591
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,714
What do you want me to do?
Act like I'm gay?

592
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:44,908
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

593
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,917
I don't believe you two have
formally been introduced.

594
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:49,852
- This is my life partner.
- I'm not his life...

595
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:51,788
He's a little seasick this morning.

596
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:54,485
- Maybe he's just a little lovesick.
- Right!

597
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,267
- We're into S&M.
- Okay.

598
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:04,462
If you feel better later you would
like to come to my new class?

599
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,801
- Yeah? It 's dirty dancing.
- Dirty dancing?

600
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,736
- So taboo.
- What the hell's wrong with you?

601
00:43:11,947 --> 00:43:13,778
"He's my life partner".

602
00:43:14,783 --> 00:43:17,843
You need to keep an open mind.
Nick! Hey!

603
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:22,680
- It 's only for a few days.
- Quit bugging me.

604
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,553
I'm getting my nuts handed to me
on a platter.

605
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,285
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Don't say it!

606
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,032
- Why not?
- Cause I won't, that 's why.

607
00:43:33,335 --> 00:43:34,700
Be a friend.

608
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,168
As a friend?
You're a wiener.

609
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:40,103
Now buzz off. I'm trying
to concentrate on my workout.

610
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,511
You're not working out.

611
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:13,402
Nick, if you do me this one favor,
I promise you I...

612
00:44:14,677 --> 00:44:15,666
Nick!

613
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:19,079
Come on, listen.
I'm begging you.

614
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,756
- Maybe I'll skip the steam.
- That 's a good idea.

615
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,850
Listen...

616
00:44:32,561 --> 00:44:37,055
After what happened with Felicia, I
thought I'd never feel this way again.

617
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:39,564
Why are you making such
a big deal about this girl?

618
00:44:39,768 --> 00:44:42,703
- She's a classic man-hater.
- No, no, no.

619
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:46,272
Gabriella doesn't mean it. She's just
had bad luck with guys she dates...

620
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,808
because they only want to have sex
with her. You know the type.

621
00:44:50,846 --> 00:44:53,076
Don't ever take sides
against the guys.

622
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,843
Nick, I just need a few days
to get to know her.

623
00:44:58,053 --> 00:44:59,748
Then I'll tell her the truth.

624
00:45:05,027 --> 00:45:07,188
Why are you hiding
from that woman?

625
00:45:07,796 --> 00:45:10,458
Hiding? I'm not hiding.
I have a cramp.

626
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:13,497
Nick, I'm desperate.

627
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:17,763
- What if I offered to pay you?
- Pay me! How dare you!

628
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,665
You think I'd sacrifice my dignity,
my self-esteem...

629
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:25,006
my whole way of life for a few,
measly dollars? No!

630
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,415
- Five hundred, cash?
- I'll do it!

631
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:32,812
- Come closer, you're too far away.
- No!

632
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,421
Hey, hey. Hold on.

633
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:37,717
Beautiful. Very nice, everyone.
I love it.

634
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,493
Jerry, you're light on your feet.

635
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,858
This whole place
is light on its feet.

636
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,667
Nick, your body's too stiff.
Wait. Listen to me.

637
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,898
Your body's too stiff.
I want you to loosen up. Come on.

638
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:55,804
There you go. Move it and then
go on, dance by yourself.

639
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:58,673
Feel the music, Nick.
Feel it.

640
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,851
Feel it.

641
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,043
Okay, everyone.
Change partners.

642
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,190
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha.
We meet again, "chêrie".

643
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:45,360
I hope that 's your belt buckle
I feel back there.

644
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:49,587
You know, from the moment
we met, I felt there was...

645
00:46:49,798 --> 00:46:54,030
...an electrical charge between us.
- I think your pacemaker shortened out.

646
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:58,035
How did you know
I like to be humiliated?

647
00:46:58,674 --> 00:47:01,040
Look, Lloyd, you're barking up
the wrong tree here.

648
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,373
I know.

649
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,737
- You want to lead.
- Lloyd, I'm not...

650
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,745
interested.

651
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,945
That 's alright. I'm a patient man.
I can wait.

652
00:47:16,225 --> 00:47:18,022
I'm also very rich.

653
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,058
You know,
I'd like to spoil you, Nick.

654
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:24,428
Take you to places
you've never been.

655
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,931
Show you things you've never seen.

656
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,328
I'd like to...

657
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:32,970
Jerry!

658
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:35,472
Cha-cha-cha.

659
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:38,875
That 's it.

660
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:41,242
You know, you're
a really good dance teacher.

661
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:44,213
Really? It 's fun to
teach a class like this.

662
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:47,047
I always felt too self-conscious
to really...

663
00:47:48,357 --> 00:47:51,087
...cut loose, you know?
- We have a revue here on board.

664
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:52,920
It 's like an amateur night thing.

665
00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:55,619
- You think you'd be interested?
- Too public.

666
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:58,731
- I'm more of a closet dancer.
- That 's a shame.

667
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:02,233
- Because I'm the choreographer.
- Really?

668
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:07,102
Well, for you,
I might just waltz out of the closet.

669
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,307
- You know... it 's strange.
- What 's that?

670
00:48:13,315 --> 00:48:15,840
The way you stare at me sometimes.

671
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:18,110
The way you touch me like that,
you know?

672
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,084
It 's exactly the way
a straight guy would.

673
00:48:21,456 --> 00:48:24,550
Me? Straight? Girlfriend, please!

674
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:28,157
Nobody's gotta teach me
how to be gay.

675
00:48:29,464 --> 00:48:33,764
Bette Midler is also known
as the Divine Miss...

676
00:48:35,604 --> 00:48:38,300
- M?
- Very good!

677
00:48:38,507 --> 00:48:40,407
Very good.
Oh, sorry!

678
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:44,067
Okay, now describe the Brandy
Alexander you're drinking.

679
00:48:45,647 --> 00:48:49,083
- Refreshing.
- No, no, no! It is to die for!

680
00:48:49,418 --> 00:48:54,219
Also acceptable divine,
marvellous, charming and ooh-la-la.

681
00:48:57,459 --> 00:49:01,555
<i>At first lwas afraid</i>
<i>lwas petrified</i>

682
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:06,291
<i>Kept thinking I could never live</i>
<i>Without you by my side</i>

683
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:09,163
<i>But then I spent so many nights</i>

684
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:11,635
<i>Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

685
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,535
<i>And I grew strong</i>

686
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:15,902
<i>And I learned how to get along</i>

687
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:17,738
<i>And now you're back</i>

688
00:49:17,946 --> 00:49:19,880
<i>From outer space</i>

689
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:23,347
<i>I just walked in to see you there</i>
<i>With that sad look upon your</i>

690
00:49:23,552 --> 00:49:25,645
Why you stopped singing?

691
00:49:25,854 --> 00:49:29,312
I don't know the words.

692
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:33,984
You want to convince people you're
gay and you don't know the words?

693
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:37,157
Singing disco tunes
and wearing calypso outfits...

694
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:39,459
is not going to help me
convince Gabriella that I'm gay.

695
00:49:39,668 --> 00:49:41,158
Hector, this is stupid.

696
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:48,169
Are you humming "I Will Survive?"

697
00:49:48,377 --> 00:49:50,402
That 's right.
And I know all the words.

698
00:49:52,848 --> 00:49:55,476
- You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
- I'm not.

699
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:56,740
- You know what?
- What?

700
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,012
Champagne usually
makes me a crazy, too.

701
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:02,690
Champagne, ocean air...

702
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,283
strange things might happen.

703
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:08,756
I might turn into
a raging heterosexual.

704
00:50:11,733 --> 00:50:15,567
I should be so lucky.
Can you imagine?

705
00:50:16,104 --> 00:50:18,629
You know what? Let 's get
this party on its feet. Come on.

706
00:50:50,105 --> 00:50:52,801
Inga, it 's me, Nicky.

707
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,940
Open up.

708
00:50:55,143 --> 00:50:56,167
Nicky.

709
00:50:56,378 --> 00:50:59,006
- So Mr. Tongue has a name.
- I'm sorry about what happened.

710
00:50:59,214 --> 00:51:01,478
You don't have to hit me.
The deed was punishment enough.

711
00:51:01,783 --> 00:51:03,512
"Nej, nej, nej."

712
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:06,313
If we ever hook up again,
I want to show you.

713
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,115
- I can reciprocate.
- Reciprocate?

714
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,667
Hey, Nick!

715
00:51:56,872 --> 00:51:59,397
Hey, fresh meat.
Have a seat, Nick.

716
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:01,576
I can always use
a little extra spending money.

717
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:03,768
What the hell, I can use
a quiet game of poker.

718
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:08,609
Sorry I'm late, boys. I had trouble
squeezing into this pantyhose.

719
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:11,308
- So, what 's the game?
- Five card stud.

720
00:52:11,653 --> 00:52:14,986
- Very appropriate.
- Let 's play some cards.

721
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:21,119
- I'm tired. Are you tired?
- Yeah! Wait. One more.

722
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,465
Hector!

723
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:43,033
You've been on a boat before.

724
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:46,112
- Is it safe?
- Of course it 's safe!

725
00:53:46,314 --> 00:53:49,181
As long as you are responsible.

726
00:53:49,384 --> 00:53:51,818
You mean the storm?
Well, that I do not know.

727
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,188
Hector, let me ask you something.

728
00:53:57,392 --> 00:54:00,919
- How many cruises have you been on?
- Including this one?

729
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:02,892
That would make it...

730
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:07,828
one. You see, I only recently
came all the way out of the closet.

731
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,835
Recently, really?
I would've figured kindergarten.

732
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,167
No. Well, let me tell you.
It wasn't easy.

733
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,773
But it 's better to be true
to yourself...

734
00:54:16,978 --> 00:54:19,003
than to lie to the world.

735
00:54:20,615 --> 00:54:22,139
It must 've taken a lot of guts.

736
00:54:22,484 --> 00:54:23,576
It 's funny, you know?

737
00:54:23,785 --> 00:54:26,413
These guys I'm playing poker with.
Steven, Tom, Ron.

738
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:28,186
Steven's a doctor.

739
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,857
A gay heart surgeon.
Who would've thought?

740
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,555
Ron's a criminal defence attorney.
He represents some bad-assed dudes.

741
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:36,122
Tom's cross-dresser
and pastry chef.

742
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,926
Okay, I would have guessed that.

743
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:41,568
But still,
they're a great bunch of guys.

744
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,034
- So what are you saying?
- What am I saying?

745
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:49,142
What I'm saying is I kinda wanted
to hang out more with these guys.

746
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:54,748
But there was a part of me that
felt it was somehow wrong...

747
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,417
to be friends with gay men.

748
00:54:57,886 --> 00:55:01,583
And that...
makes me feel like a jerk.

749
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,327
Sit.

750
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,423
Come on, sit.

751
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:17,867
You know, my Papa, he used to
think that to be gay was "muy malo".

752
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,764
A big shame.

753
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:24,273
He no talk to me for 2O years.
His own blood.

754
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:29,140
Now he's sick, he's dying.
He asks for me. He say to me...

755
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:33,117
"Hector, I waste so much time.

756
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:39,760
We're all God's children.
I'm so sorry." He said so.

757
00:55:48,003 --> 00:55:51,803
You see, my Papi, he's like you.
A real jerk.

758
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,708
He just needed to learn.

759
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,241
You learn too, my friend.

760
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,086
I'm hurting.

761
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:11,885
It feels so good
to get off my feet!

762
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,261
I couldn't agree with you more.

763
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,061
You know what?

764
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:23,435
I've got to get out
of these clothes.

765
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:26,097
I couldn't agree with you more.

766
00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:31,607
Listen, would you mind doing me
a huge, huge favor?

767
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,914
Would you spend the night with me?

768
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:35,440
What?

769
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:37,683
Yeah, you know, it 's the storm.

770
00:56:37,886 --> 00:56:40,684
I wouldn't mind cuddling
under the covers with somebody.

771
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,755
You think Nick would mind?

772
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:49,153
Fuck Nick.

773
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:54,661
Is this storm getting worse,
or am I too drunk or...

774
00:56:56,338 --> 00:56:58,272
I have a theory.

775
00:56:59,007 --> 00:57:01,032
I think if we drank more...

776
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:03,802
we might be able to maintain
perfect equilibrium.

777
00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:09,177
I'll try that in the pursuit
of science.

778
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,045
I'll get us another round.

779
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:13,083
I have a better idea.

780
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,988
I have a fifty-year old bottle
of cognac in my room...

781
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,318
...and I'm gonna go get it.
- I'll go with you.

782
00:57:22,797 --> 00:57:25,357
I could use the exercise.

783
00:57:28,169 --> 00:57:30,467
Jerry, we can get out
from under the covers.

784
00:57:30,672 --> 00:57:33,766
I think the storm was over,
like, half an hour ago.

785
00:57:34,943 --> 00:57:37,639
It was one hell of a storm, though.

786
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:41,475
You know, I have something
you're gonna love.

787
00:57:43,184 --> 00:57:47,086
- Get ready to have an orgasm.
- What?

788
00:57:47,288 --> 00:57:48,983
Open wide.

789
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,084
- Good?
- Yeah.

790
00:57:58,032 --> 00:58:01,490
- Do me.
- You're so lucky I'm gay.

791
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,206
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

792
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,318
- How do you do it?
- Do what?

793
00:58:19,387 --> 00:58:22,015
- Give head.
- What?

794
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:27,056
A blow job. I mean, do you start
on the tip of his penis?

795
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,862
Or you stroke it
while you use your mouth?

796
00:58:30,064 --> 00:58:32,760
- Do you tickle the balls?
- Not everybody likes that.

797
00:58:33,902 --> 00:58:36,132
As a person who gives them
and receives them...

798
00:58:36,337 --> 00:58:38,771
you must know the perfect way.
Show me.

799
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:41,374
What?

800
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,040
Okay.

801
00:58:56,057 --> 00:58:57,888
You...

802
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,218
It 's a little small.

803
00:59:01,095 --> 00:59:02,585
You know, I got an idea.

804
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:06,824
Why don't you show me your
technique, and then I'll critique it.

805
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,695
- Okay.
- Okay.

806
00:59:11,306 --> 00:59:13,069
- Okay.
- Okay.

807
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:16,700
So look. First...

808
00:59:16,911 --> 00:59:21,644
I slowly lick the tip
with my tongue, right?

809
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,049
- Right?
- That 's good.

810
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,423
Then I gently go down
the shaft with my lips.

811
00:59:36,097 --> 00:59:38,861
And in time, I tickle the balls.

812
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:43,163
Then I twirl my tongue
all the way...

813
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:48,135
back to the top.

814
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,239
Then I wet my lips.

815
00:59:53,414 --> 00:59:55,644
I do a little playful nibbling.

816
00:59:58,786 --> 01:00:01,516
"Eso me encanta
porque es maravilloso."

817
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,621
"Eu te amo, te amo."

818
01:00:07,762 --> 01:00:10,094
How's that?
Jerry?

819
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:12,231
That 's fine!

820
01:00:16,337 --> 01:00:19,966
For goodness' sake, Lloyd.
At least kiss me first.

821
01:00:21,476 --> 01:00:24,536
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

822
01:00:27,515 --> 01:00:29,847
Now, where did I put that bag?

823
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:32,243
I'm just going to lay down.

824
01:00:37,992 --> 01:00:39,983
Got it.

825
01:00:41,829 --> 01:00:44,263
Now, before we go
back up with the boys...

826
01:00:44,465 --> 01:00:47,127
what do you say
we do a couple of shots?

827
01:00:48,369 --> 01:00:51,736
You're a goddamned genius.

828
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,498
Here you go.

829
01:01:48,129 --> 01:01:50,324
Oh...

830
01:01:50,531 --> 01:01:52,328
my...

831
01:01:52,533 --> 01:01:53,522
God!

832
01:02:03,478 --> 01:02:05,378
What are you doing?

833
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,945
I have a horrible taste in my mouth,
Jerry, and I can't get rid of it.

834
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:10,674
Did you eat something weird?

835
01:02:10,885 --> 01:02:12,284
Yeah.

836
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:15,681
- I did a bad, bad thing, Jerry.
- What?

837
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:18,749
You know how the sea air makes
you disoriented and there was...

838
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,329
the drinking and the partying
and I slept with a man, Jerry.

839
01:02:25,466 --> 01:02:26,558
Very funny.

840
01:02:27,602 --> 01:02:29,001
No, it 's not.

841
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:31,296
I just woke up in Ron's stateroom.

842
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:33,402
- With Ron.
- What?

843
01:02:35,777 --> 01:02:37,870
I've chased a lot of women, Jerry.

844
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,603
To be honest...

845
01:02:40,281 --> 01:02:43,717
I never actually scored with one
since I was a senior in high school...

846
01:02:43,918 --> 01:02:45,943
and then I had to promise
to marry her.

847
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,982
A fifty-one year old
coffee shop waitress.

848
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:51,887
And a stroke victim...

849
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,921
with a fake leg...

850
01:02:54,495 --> 01:02:56,224
and a lazy eye...

851
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:58,465
...and a mole with...
- I got it.

852
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:00,395
What I'm trying to say is...

853
01:03:00,935 --> 01:03:04,598
maybe I'm meant to do more than
just play cards with these guys.

854
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:09,740
I'm finally happy.
So happy.

855
01:03:10,778 --> 01:03:11,938
I'm gay.

856
01:03:12,146 --> 01:03:15,980
One, two, three, four...

857
01:03:16,184 --> 01:03:20,211
five, six, seven, eight.

858
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:24,016
And one, two, three, four...

859
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:27,524
five, six, seven, eight.
Good.

860
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,294
Good work, guys. Good work.

861
01:03:29,497 --> 01:03:31,624
Hector, try not shaking
your ass so much.

862
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:33,960
You mean in the dance,
or in real life?

863
01:03:35,236 --> 01:03:39,673
OK, guys. Thank you for coming. I'll
see you back here tonight at eleven.

864
01:03:39,874 --> 01:03:42,570
Jerry, you are looking
fierce up there.

865
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,645
I can't remember when
I've had this much fun.

866
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:50,144
You know, you're just great.

867
01:03:50,418 --> 01:03:51,680
Hey!

868
01:03:52,687 --> 01:03:54,746
- Are you gonna go to the island?
- I am.

869
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:56,355
Do you want me to be
your tour guide?

870
01:03:56,557 --> 01:03:58,115
I know the island very well.

871
01:03:58,326 --> 01:04:01,420
- That would be yummy.
- Yummy.

872
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,960
Let 's go.

873
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:17,299
Nicholas... I was beginning
to wonder about you.

874
01:04:17,578 --> 01:04:22,072
I'm glad to see you finally got that
luscious full figure frame of yours...

875
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:25,309
...in the right dinghy.
- It 's amazing.

876
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,616
A day ago I would've punched you in
the face for saying a thing like that.

877
01:04:29,891 --> 01:04:31,483
- This place is paradise.
- Oh, yeah.

878
01:04:31,692 --> 01:04:33,455
- We're gonna have an awesome time.
- I'll say.

879
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,653
I can already feel the men around here
undressing me with their eyes.

880
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:40,295
- Hungry? Want something to eat?
- Nope. I have a better idea.

881
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,696
- Let 's go exploring first.
- Great.

882
01:04:43,871 --> 01:04:46,772
Daddy, thanks so much for finding
out where Jerry is for me.

883
01:04:46,974 --> 01:04:49,033
Yeah, I'm sure things are gonna
work out, too.

884
01:04:49,243 --> 01:04:50,938
Bye-bye. Love you, Daddy.

885
01:04:51,546 --> 01:04:53,104
How do I get
to the Olympic Voyager?

886
01:04:53,314 --> 01:04:54,303
Right this way, madam.

887
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,313
Be careful with those bags. They're
worth more than you make in a year.

888
01:04:58,252 --> 01:05:01,551
Bon voyage... bitch.

889
01:05:02,924 --> 01:05:06,382
- Hi Nick. How you doing?
- Hey, fine.

890
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:08,619
I'm not sore, or anything.

891
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,559
Hey buddy, about last night...

892
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:14,596
I understand why it happened.
I mean, I'm pretty charismatic.

893
01:05:14,802 --> 01:05:18,795
If the moon hits me in just the right
way, I can look pretty damn tasty.

894
01:05:19,473 --> 01:05:23,967
You're okay too, but I just really
rather we stay friends.

895
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,437
Alright. Me too, Nick.

896
01:05:26,647 --> 01:05:27,636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

897
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:29,146
- Wow.
- Yeah.

898
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:31,511
If I had said that to a chick,
she'd be a total mess right now.

899
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:33,450
I'm starting to see the upside
to this whole thing.

900
01:05:33,654 --> 01:05:36,589
<i>You do what Sonya says</i>, <i>team</i>
<i>You do what Sonya says</i>

901
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,780
One, two, three, four.

902
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:41,291
<i>Woke upwith no tanning cream</i>
<i>Now you're off the tanning team</i>

903
01:05:41,495 --> 01:05:45,829
- One, two, three, four.
- Coach, it 's the Hawaiian Tropic team.

904
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,048
Hey, break it up, ladies! Come on!

905
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:07,847
Come on! Take it easy!

906
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,622
Break it up! Break it up!

907
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,655
Save it for the tanning competition!

908
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:16,626
Bad! You are bad.
Now everybody move out! Now!

909
01:06:23,004 --> 01:06:26,269
Okay, girls.
Get your heinies on the donkeys.

910
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,167
Now.

911
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,005
Nick.

912
01:06:32,313 --> 01:06:35,680
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I'm going to the airport now.

913
01:06:35,883 --> 01:06:39,182
Inga, it was great almost
knowing you.

914
01:06:39,387 --> 01:06:42,288
Nick, if you're ever near
Gettzemüllersteigen, Sweden...

915
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:46,551
...I would love to see you again.
- I don't think so, baby.

916
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,388
I don't think this is gonna work out.

917
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:51,692
But, I thought you liked me, Nick.

918
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:56,901
- I'm confused.
- So am I. You don't even know.

919
01:06:57,271 --> 01:06:59,899
You better hurry.
You have an ass to catch.

920
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,707
And you...

921
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:06,209
Hey.

922
01:07:09,016 --> 01:07:11,177
And go.

923
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:15,582
Oh, it feels good.

924
01:07:17,391 --> 01:07:20,451
Hey, Nick. About last night...

925
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,856
you don't think
anything happened, do you?

926
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:26,762
- What do you think happened?
- Nothing.

927
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:29,402
You and I drank too much
and then fell asleep.

928
01:07:29,603 --> 01:07:31,764
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

929
01:07:32,573 --> 01:07:35,064
Inga!

930
01:07:37,478 --> 01:07:39,469
Inga!

931
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,940
Well, I think we lost
that one forever.

932
01:07:42,149 --> 01:07:43,980
A lot of potential in that boy.

933
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,312
He could've been
one of the great ones.

934
01:07:46,988 --> 01:07:49,980
I saw in him
what I saw in Elton John.

935
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,493
Had your Vitamin C today?

936
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,661
You know, you really make me laugh.

937
01:08:10,478 --> 01:08:12,343
I'm so glad we met.

938
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:17,039
You know...

939
01:08:17,251 --> 01:08:21,779
it really is a shame
to let this place go to waste.

940
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:24,490
Just a friendly kiss?

941
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,694
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

942
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,997
I don't want to feel like I am...

943
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:36,601
pressuring you into doing something
you don't want to do.

944
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,266
I want to do this very badly.

945
01:08:39,473 --> 01:08:41,168
- Really?
- Yes.

946
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:43,907
So, let me be your guide.

947
01:08:44,812 --> 01:08:48,179
And I promise I'm gonna be gentle.

948
01:08:48,382 --> 01:08:49,940
I'm gonna be patient.

949
01:08:50,151 --> 01:08:54,178
And I'm going to take it
very, very slowly.

950
01:08:54,388 --> 01:08:56,117
Great.

951
01:09:23,651 --> 01:09:25,642
Jerry... Jerry...

952
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:28,954
You're a really quick stud.

953
01:09:30,357 --> 01:09:32,382
That 's enough foreplay.

954
01:09:34,428 --> 01:09:38,057
Excuse me. Could you ring
Jerry Robinson's room, please?

955
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:40,195
Certainly.

956
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:50,205
No one seems
to be answering, ma'am.

957
01:09:50,411 --> 01:09:52,003
Could you give me his room number?

958
01:09:52,379 --> 01:09:54,779
I'm sorry, we're not allowed
to divulge that information.

959
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,609
Would you like to leave a message?

960
01:09:56,851 --> 01:10:00,184
No, thanks.
I want to surprise him.

961
01:10:01,555 --> 01:10:03,182
Thank you.

962
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:15,826
You wanna have dinner
with me tonight?

963
01:10:17,571 --> 01:10:20,472
- No.
- Why not?

964
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:25,971
Because I'm falling in love
with you.

965
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:29,072
You are?

966
01:10:29,316 --> 01:10:30,943
Yes, I am.

967
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:35,646
Of all the dumb, boneheaded, romantic
moves I've made over the years...

968
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:39,155
...this will be the dumbest.
- Now wait a minute.

969
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,625
- This could work.
- How do you think it 's gonna work?

970
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,058
I cannot make you into something
you're not, Jerry.

971
01:10:45,266 --> 01:10:49,930
I do that with every man
I fall for and it has to stop.

972
01:10:52,106 --> 01:10:55,906
- Besides, you already have someone.
- No, I don't.

973
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,973
What about Nick?

974
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:04,413
That 's just physical.

975
01:11:05,186 --> 01:11:09,020
Listen, I have to accept
who you really are.

976
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,020
I really want to be alone right now.

977
01:11:46,961 --> 01:11:49,452
- Hi.
- Hi.

978
01:11:50,197 --> 01:11:52,631
It 's kind of nice
seeing another woman aboard.

979
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,232
Tell me about it.

980
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:57,165
All I've seen are men.
Most of them gay.

981
01:11:57,371 --> 01:11:59,134
Well, it is a gay cruise.

982
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,608
- What did you just say?
- You didn't know?

983
01:12:04,812 --> 01:12:08,339
No! I came on board to get back
together with my boyfriend.

984
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:12,178
I don't get it! Why in the world
would he be on a gay...

985
01:12:17,057 --> 01:12:18,888
Good luck.

986
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,927
Thanks.

987
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,626
We're just gonna put them
on the stage.

988
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:24,354
Hector!

989
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:28,901
- Have you seen Gabriella?
- No, I've been looking for her myself.

990
01:12:29,103 --> 01:12:32,266
Everything is falling apart.
The music is not ready.

991
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,465
Victor, the lead dancer, is seasick.

992
01:12:36,343 --> 01:12:40,643
And look at my costume!
It hangs. It 's supposed to drape!

993
01:12:41,248 --> 01:12:44,217
OK, if you see Gabriella, could you
give her this message for me, please?

994
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:49,113
How could I've been so blind?

995
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,587
I mean, the signs were right
in front of my eyes.

996
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:58,287
Foreign films... grab a convertible.
Gourmet mustards.

997
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:05,200
Wait... maybe he's only curious.

998
01:13:05,406 --> 01:13:07,966
I mean, there was that
one time when I was in college...

999
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:11,702
my roommate Bianca and I,
we shared a Jacuzzi.

1000
01:13:14,148 --> 01:13:16,616
That got kinda hot.

1001
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:23,723
- I got to go, pal. Keep the change.
- Thanks.

1002
01:13:26,393 --> 01:13:33,322
<i>Think twice before you</i>
<i>blow the man down!</i>

1003
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:38,501
Get everybody ready for the next
number. They have less than a minute.

1004
01:13:41,008 --> 01:13:42,407
What?

1005
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,944
Nobody told me Victor was too sick
to dance. Who's gonna be the lead?

1006
01:13:47,348 --> 01:13:52,149
<i>I' m coming</i>
<i>Comin' out</i>

1007
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:59,187
<i>I' m comin' out</i>

1008
01:14:00,094 --> 01:14:01,925
Oh, my God.

1009
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,288

<i>I think this time around</i>

1019
01:14:38,665 --> 01:14:40,326
<i>Like you never knew it</i>

1020
01:14:40,534 --> 01:14:42,798
<i>I' II make it through</i>

1021
01:14:43,237 --> 01:14:46,729
<i>The time has come for me</i>
<i>To break out of a shell</i>

1022
01:14:47,241 --> 01:14:50,540
<i>I have to shout</i>
<i>That I am coming out</i>

1023
01:14:51,178 --> 01:14:52,611
<i>I' m comin' out</i>

1024
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,248

01:14:58,886 --> 01:15:01,116

1028
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,618
<i>Got to let it show</i>

1029
01:15:07,094 --> 01:15:11,360
<i>I' m comin' out</i>

1030
01:15:14,835 --> 01:15:17,030

1032
01:15:19,673 --> 01:15:21,197
<i>Got to let it show</i>

1033
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:24,707
<i>I' m comin' out</i>

1034
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:26,903
<i>lwant the world to know</i>

1035
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,142
<i>Got to let it show</i>

1036
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:33,110
<i>I' m comin' out</i>

1037
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,455

01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,419

01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,158
<i>I' m comin' out</i>

01:15:41,361 --> 01:15:43,329
<i>lwant the world to know</i>

1041
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,828
<i>Got to let it show</i>

1042
01:15:51,705 --> 01:15:55,141
- Cocksucker!
- Felicia!

1043
01:15:58,111 --> 01:16:00,306
I was talking to him.

1044
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,379
Felicia!

1045
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:10,452
- Felicia! What are you doing here?
- Don't even talk to me.

1046
01:16:10,657 --> 01:16:13,683
- I feel so humiliated.
- Well, how did you find me?

1047
01:16:13,894 --> 01:16:15,521
What were you thinking about
when we were making love, Jerry?

1048
01:16:15,729 --> 01:16:18,357
- Cabana Boys?
- Hey, I am not gay.

1049
01:16:18,565 --> 01:16:21,159
And to think
I wanted to be your wife!

1050
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,336
What?

1051
01:16:24,004 --> 01:16:25,995
I really missed you, Jerry.

1052
01:16:26,306 --> 01:16:28,570
All the special times we had.
We complemented each other.

1053
01:16:28,775 --> 01:16:30,675
We could've built a life together.

1054
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:33,377
- Build a life together?
- Yes!

1055
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,016
- What about Andrê, the buffer boy?
- It was just a fling.

1056
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:40,618
A horrible, thoughtless,
insensitive mistake.

1057
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:43,186
But it showed me
what I really wanted, Jerry.

1058
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:46,154
A stable, decent man who would
always be there for me.

1059
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:49,086
And I thought that that was you.

1060
01:16:49,863 --> 01:16:51,797
What are you saying?
You want to get back together?

1061
01:16:52,099 --> 01:16:53,657
Well, I did.

1062
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,596
Before I found out
that you were gay.

1063
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,532
How could you think I'm gay?

1064
01:16:59,806 --> 01:17:02,570
You're standing there preening
like a gay peacock...

1065
01:17:02,776 --> 01:17:04,767
and you don't want me to think
you're tutti-frutti?

1066
01:17:04,978 --> 01:17:09,881
For heaven's sake, Felicia. I'm not
gay and I never have been gay.

1067
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,449
Then why the hell
are you on this boat?

1068
01:17:12,653 --> 01:17:16,419
Nick! Nick and I got on
this cruise by mistake.

1069
01:17:16,623 --> 01:17:20,024
And then I met this girl
and she assumed I was gay!

1070
01:17:20,227 --> 01:17:22,821
And then I stupidly went along
with it because...

1071
01:17:24,565 --> 01:17:25,964
She's behind me, isn't she?

1072
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:33,962
How could you?

1073
01:17:35,175 --> 01:17:37,006
Gabriella, I'm sorry.

1074
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:41,142
- I tried to tell you.
- You're an asshole, Jerry.

1075
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,548
Not again!

1076
01:17:52,326 --> 01:17:55,386
That was the girl
I was talking about.

1077
01:17:56,029 --> 01:17:59,294
Well, looks like you
had a dumb fling yourself.

1078
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:02,467
I'll tell you what.
If you can forgive me...

1079
01:18:02,669 --> 01:18:04,694
I can certainly forgive you.

1080
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,772
And we can get married
just like you always wanted, Jerry.

1081
01:18:09,176 --> 01:18:12,942
I love you, baby.
What do you say?

1082
01:18:15,282 --> 01:18:15,873
Great.

1083
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:19,575
Now one of the bride and groom
staring at each other lovingly.

1084
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,919
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1085
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:28,722
Why don't we both look beautiful?
Take out that earring.

1086
01:18:30,263 --> 01:18:32,231
Felicia is good for me.

1087
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:40,534
She planned this entire wedding,
all by herself.

1088
01:18:41,775 --> 01:18:44,369
Got me a great job
with her father.

1089
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:48,405
Got us a new apartment. Picked out
all the linens and plates.

1090
01:18:48,982 --> 01:18:52,577
And as a wedding gift, she gave me
an entire new wardrobe.

1091
01:18:55,255 --> 01:18:58,452
Yep, the only decision I have left
to make for the rest of my life...

1092
01:18:58,659 --> 01:19:01,253
is whether I want to be
buried or cremated.

1093
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:03,361
No. I take that back.

1094
01:19:03,764 --> 01:19:06,426
We're being buried side by side.
She told me this morning.

1095
01:19:25,452 --> 01:19:27,420
Hey, Jerry, I'm sorry I'm late.

1096
01:19:27,621 --> 01:19:29,816
I had a little bit of a
personal crisis this morning.

1097
01:19:30,023 --> 01:19:31,718
- Is everything alright, pastor?
- Fine, fine.

1098
01:19:31,925 --> 01:19:35,224
Just I had a few personal issues
I had to clarify, but...

1099
01:19:35,429 --> 01:19:37,329
It 's your big day.
Nothing's going to spoil it.

1100
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:39,396
Glad to see
you finally made it, reverend.

1101
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:42,692
I got a string quartet back at the
Hyatt about to go into golden time.

1102
01:19:42,969 --> 01:19:44,766
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

1103
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,635
- They're friends of yours, Jerry?
- Yes, sir.

1104
01:19:47,841 --> 01:19:49,365
I met them on the cruise.

1105
01:19:50,277 --> 01:19:52,711
So you accidentally hopped onto
the Guytanic, too?

1106
01:19:53,113 --> 01:19:56,310
- How's it going?
- I guess not.

1107
01:19:57,017 --> 01:19:59,884
Jerry, I'm gonna keep
my eye on you.

1108
01:20:01,054 --> 01:20:04,217
- What 's up, guys?
- Nick, come here. It 's important.

1109
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:10,721
There is no more sacred contract
than the bond of marriage.

1110
01:20:11,398 --> 01:20:16,461
And no more spiritual union than
that between a man and a woman.

1111
01:20:17,504 --> 01:20:19,836
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

1112
01:20:20,207 --> 01:20:25,907
to bring this man and this woman
together in the eyes of...

1113
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:30,083
in the eyes of...

1114
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:32,875
God?

1115
01:20:33,086 --> 01:20:36,214
- God, yeah, that 's what you say.
- No, that 's what you say.

1116
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:40,415
Yeah, well I used to
until recently. I mean...

1117
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:43,719
if there was a God would He
allow my wife to run off...

1118
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:46,330
with a non-union contractor who
overcharged me for a bay window?

1119
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:50,162
But that 's my problem, I'm sorry, and
it 's your day. I'm sorry. Where was I?

1120
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:54,067
A happy marriage is the
perfect human relationship.

1121
01:20:54,441 --> 01:20:58,810
A setting in which each partner
feels free to be as he or she is...

1122
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:01,446
under God's bountiful nature.

1123
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:05,448
That same nature that allowed
the number 547 PIN code...

1124
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:08,987
to screw me in a photo.
I'm sorry, where was I?

1125
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:14,719
If there's anyone present who feels
that these two people should not...

1126
01:21:14,928 --> 01:21:17,362
...be joined together in matrimony...
- Come on.

1127
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:20,590
...let them speak now,
or forever hold their peace.

1128
01:21:26,473 --> 01:21:27,633
Okay, fine.

1129
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:31,607
Jerry, then, if there's no objection,
turn to Felicia and repeat after me.

1130
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,611
I, Jerry...

1131
01:21:34,881 --> 01:21:36,405
take you, Felicia...

1132
01:21:36,616 --> 01:21:40,780
...to be my lawful-wedded...
- Stop! Wait! Time out! Time out!

1133
01:21:40,987 --> 01:21:44,923
- Nick! What are you doing?
- I have to say something.

1134
01:21:45,325 --> 01:21:47,793
If I didn't speak now,
I could never live with myself.

1135
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:49,988
A couple of weeks ago...

1136
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:53,064
Jerry and I took a cruise together.

1137
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:56,167
It wasn't the cruise
we intended to take, but...

1138
01:21:56,536 --> 01:22:00,905
it was good we got in the wrong boat
because it changed our lives forever.

1139
01:22:01,174 --> 01:22:05,838
Jerry, if you marry Felicia today,
it will end up in disaster.

1140
01:22:06,246 --> 01:22:10,046
You need to be with the person
you fell in love with on that boat.

1141
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:17,456
And I know it,
because that person is me.

1142
01:22:21,795 --> 01:22:24,025
How much of that pot
did you smoke?

1143
01:22:24,264 --> 01:22:26,255
I know where Gabriella is.
If you hurry we can catch her.

1144
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:29,935
Jerry?
What the hell is wrong with you?

1145
01:22:30,203 --> 01:22:34,503
You can't humiliate me like this!
My dad is gonna kill you!

1146
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:38,036
- Come on, Rocco! Come on, boy!
- Daddy!

1147
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:40,645
Come on, move! Move!

1148
01:22:41,615 --> 01:22:43,640
Daddy, do something!

1149
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,016
- Where's your car?
- We're not taking my car.

1150
01:22:48,221 --> 01:22:50,018
We'd never make it across town
in this traffic.

1151
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:53,986
Boys! Boys!

1152
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,663
- Hector! You're a fireman!
- Yes!

1153
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:05,335
I'm December in our calendar.

1154
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:10,741
Thank you, Ernie, dear.

1155
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:12,172
Call me!

1156
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,411
So where is Gabriella?

1157
01:23:19,686 --> 01:23:21,916
She signed up
to work another cruise.

1158
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:25,725
- When does she leave port?
- Two hours ago!

1159
01:23:26,059 --> 01:23:27,526
Two hours ago?

1160
01:23:28,028 --> 01:23:31,259
And how am I supposed
to find her in the ocean?

1161
01:23:37,103 --> 01:23:38,434
I can't do this!

1162
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:42,602
- I get motion sickness!
- Yes, you can. Come on, Jerry.

1163
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,709
You're about to be united
with the woman you love.

1164
01:23:44,911 --> 01:23:46,208
What do you think?

1165
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:52,046
Why don't you calm down?
You are in very, very good hands.

1166
01:23:52,585 --> 01:23:54,348
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

1167
01:23:54,754 --> 01:23:58,850
I know you only think of me
as a hard-partying old queen...

1168
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:03,223
but for your information, I spent
32 years in the Armed Forces...

1169
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:06,866
serving Her Majesty,
the real Queen.

1170
01:24:07,467 --> 01:24:09,833
I've seen action in five different
theaters of war...

1171
01:24:10,036 --> 01:24:14,132
I've made over 49O drops,
23 over hostile territory.

1172
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:19,369
I'm what you colonials might call
a bad-assed motherfucker...

1173
01:24:19,579 --> 01:24:21,638
who also happens
to be an expert...

1174
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:25,181
in the delicate art
of Japanese flower arranging.

1175
01:24:26,653 --> 01:24:28,416
Over the target, captain.

1176
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:30,913
Right! It 's now, or never.

1177
01:24:32,559 --> 01:24:35,426
Come on, Jerry, get out there!
Jump out!

1178
01:24:35,628 --> 01:24:36,617
I can't do this!

1179
01:24:37,063 --> 01:24:40,430
- Go get her, Jerry!
- This is a bad idea!

1180
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:48,003
Wait, I'm gonna be sick.
I mean it!

1181
01:24:49,976 --> 01:24:51,637
I felt that one.

1182
01:24:51,845 --> 01:24:54,336
Good Lord,
you're a crybaby.

1183
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:59,318
Five, six, seven, eight. Kick!

1184
01:24:59,519 --> 01:25:02,010
Back! Head, up, down.

1185
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,712
One more time.

1186
01:25:03,923 --> 01:25:06,949
Kick! Back!
Head, up, down.

1187
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,027
I want it sassy, now. Come on.
Kick! Pliê.

1188
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:12,992
Head, up, down.
And Kick! Pliê!

1189
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,134
I'm not a person
who likes heights!

1190
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:19,996
I don't feel so good.
I don't feel so good.

1191
01:25:22,475 --> 01:25:24,636
I hate this!

1192
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:29,707
What is that?

1193
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:32,516
- I don't like it!
- We're over the target.

1194
01:25:33,186 --> 01:25:35,381
- Prepare for release!
- Release!

1195
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:41,924
We did it!

1196
01:25:42,796 --> 01:25:44,263
I'm so excited.

1197
01:25:44,464 --> 01:25:48,332
If truth be told, I'm more
than a little excited myself.

1198
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,267
Unhook me, please.

1199
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:53,901
I don't believe this.

1200
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:55,631
Help, please.

1201
01:25:55,842 --> 01:25:57,707
This time, I'm gonna
let you drown.

1202
01:25:58,011 --> 01:25:59,842
You're gonna have to drag me
over to the deep end...

1203
01:26:00,046 --> 01:26:02,105
'cause it 's only about
three and a half feet over here.

1204
01:26:02,482 --> 01:26:03,710
What are you doing here?

1205
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:07,978
I was in the neighbourhood,
so I figured I'd just drop in.

1206
01:26:09,789 --> 01:26:12,952
- Goodbye.
- Gabriella, wait, please.

1207
01:26:18,198 --> 01:26:20,428
I thought I was being
reasonably clever...

1208
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:23,431
considering I just dropped
1,5OO feet out of an airplane.

1209
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,861
Why did you bother?

1210
01:26:38,384 --> 01:26:40,648
Because I love you.

1211
01:26:40,854 --> 01:26:42,344
Who loves me?

1212
01:26:42,555 --> 01:26:44,750
Gay Jerry as a friend?

1213
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:48,951
Or is this straight, lying,
deceitful Jerry?

1214
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,933
You've never met this Jerry.

1215
01:26:55,135 --> 01:26:57,660
This is the extremely sorry...

1216
01:26:57,871 --> 01:27:00,863
unbelievably heartbroken
because you left me...

1217
01:27:01,107 --> 01:27:02,938
who'll do anything to get you
to forgive me...

1218
01:27:03,143 --> 01:27:06,010
because I want to spend the rest
of my life with you Jerry.

1219
01:27:08,114 --> 01:27:10,048
Well, you listen to me, Jerry.

1220
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,275
Just because you dropped
out of the sky...

1221
01:27:12,585 --> 01:27:14,644
and made this grand,
romantic gesture...

1222
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:17,220
doesn't mean that I'm going to
automatically run into your arms.

1223
01:27:17,423 --> 01:27:19,220
Do you understand that?

1224
01:27:19,592 --> 01:27:20,650
- Yes.
- Good.

1225
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,663
Okay, I'm probably going to. But you
shouldn't automatically expect it...

1226
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:29,664
because if we're going to have
the kind of relationship...

1227
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:32,429
that one day you're going
to be making up these fantasies...

1228
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:42,311
Don't you ever,
ever lie to me again.

1229
01:27:42,515 --> 01:27:44,107
I swear.

1230
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:55,418
I'll never understand it.

1231
01:27:55,628 --> 01:27:57,596
Neither will I.

1232
01:28:16,182 --> 01:28:17,877
Inga!

1233
01:28:20,687 --> 01:28:22,052
Inga...

1234
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,813
Inga...

1235
01:28:24,023 --> 01:28:25,615
Inga...

1236
01:28:42,308 --> 01:28:44,902
My God! My God!

1237
01:28:46,813 --> 01:28:49,805
I'm Nick Ragoni.
I'm a friend of your daughter Inga.

1238
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:52,910
I've travelled 12 thousand miles
to surprise her.

1239
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:55,710
You poor thing. You look frozen.
Let me help you up.

1240
01:28:58,591 --> 01:29:00,354
Let me and my son help you up.

1241
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,494
- Johann, come over here.
- Ja.

1242
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:06,298
Come on.

1243
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,093
This man is obviously
a fan of smorgasbord.

1244
01:29:12,171 --> 01:29:13,570
Ingmar, what 's going on?

1245
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:16,901
Mother, he is an American friend
of Inga's.

1246
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:20,705
I hope you didn't go too much
trouble to get here.

1247
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:22,505
- Inga's not home.
- What?

1248
01:29:22,715 --> 01:29:25,206
She's gone to Italy
on a modelling assignment.

1249
01:29:25,418 --> 01:29:27,477
Won't be back for three months.

1250
01:29:27,687 --> 01:29:33,284
- Oh God, no. I can't believe it.
- You poor boy. You look so cold.

1251
01:29:33,559 --> 01:29:36,494
You'll join us for dinner.
Bridgit?

1252
01:29:36,696 --> 01:29:38,857
Get this man some soup
from the stove.

1253
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:44,762
Now this is Bridgit.
She wants to be a bikini model...

1254
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:47,405
...just like her big sister.
- Nice to meet you.

1255
01:29:48,408 --> 01:29:51,673
And Bridgit 's coach will be
joining us for dinner, too.

1256
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:01,987
Nicholas.

1257
01:30:02,588 --> 01:30:04,180
Hello.

1258
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:07,755
We meet again.
