1
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,308
What, Eve? What are you gonna do?
Gonna go run and tell M-M-Matthew?

2
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,310
You know she will, little tattletale.

3
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,880
- No, I w-w-won't.
- Stutterer.

4
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,816
Tattletale.

5
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:59,453
- Stutterer, stutterer.
- Please, stop it, please.

6
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,588
She's pathetic.

7
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:04,525
Last time she tattled,
I got grounded for a week.

8
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,329
Cool it, Donna, you too, Sandy.
Matthew's gonna go crazy.

9
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,332
No one is gonna believe
you over all of us.

10
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,367
Stop, Donna, that's enough,
she's scared.

11
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,804
- What... you in love with her, Tommy?
- What?

12
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,273
- Whose side are you on, Tommy?
- You're such a bitch.

13
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,543
I'd rather be a bitch
than a s-s-stutterer.

14
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,084
- Let's get her.
- Come on, let's get her, go.

15
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,929
M-M-Matthew, p-p-please! Help me!

16
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,099
I can't see anything in here.

17
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,767
Oh, shit.

18
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,037
Matthew, please, help me!

19
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,507
Eve, I'm over here!

20
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,209
Follow my voice!

21
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,978
Where's that little bitch?

22
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:02,283
Is that you, M-M-Matthew?
I hear you, Matthew.

23
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,819
I see her, I see her, let's get her!

24
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,089
Matthew! M-M-Matthew! M-M-Matthew!

25
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,362
Oh, my God.

26
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,533
Oh, my God. Eve!

27
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,839
Eve!

28
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,247
Eve, please. Please wake up,
please wake up.

29
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,983
Go get help... Please,
go get help, hurry!

30
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,451
Oh, my God.

31
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,785
Eve, please, please talk to me.

32
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,356
Eve, oh my God, what did we do?

33
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,919
Hey Gene, make sure you get all
four of those wagons ready tonight.

34
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,788
We're gonna need all of them, not just
the ones you finished up, all right?

35
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,721
Sure thing, boss.

36
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,596
Really, is that what
your mother taught you?

37
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,431
Stealing, first sign of
being a serial killer.

38
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,933
Wanna kill women,
that what you wanna do?

39
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,770
Hey, Tommy, really, with the cuffs?
You know how people talk around here.

40
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,806
But these punks, they fight
every inch of the way... relax.

41
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,409
- What did he do this time?
- Pocketed a bunch of candies.

42
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,810
- I was gonna repay Mr. Bates.
- Shut up.

43
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,545
Here, take my gloves,
help Eugene out, do something.

44
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,716
I have my own gloves because I'm a
professional, and obviously the only person

45
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:18,350
that cares about this place and
wipe that smirk off of your face.

46
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,091
I hope you end up in JV hall. Great.

47
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,193
- Thanks, Sarah.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,229
- Let him go, Tommy.
- What?

49
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,765
It's my place, I'm not gonna
push the issue, let him go.

50
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:36,470
Hey... you got three hours,
you hear me?

51
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,440
You pay me back or
I'll put you to work.

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,172
Thank you, Mr. Bates.

53
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,277
- Little shit.
- Hey, let it be.

54
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,748
Keep letting it be and these kids,
they're gonna run all over you.

55
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,323
Did you try on the other side?

56
00:05:56,423 --> 00:06:01,462
No, these are bags over here.
This is just like... they're all T-shirts.

57
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:06,431
- I know, did you check underneath there?
- I... I don't know, there's props, bags...

58
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,039
You scared the shit out of me, Gene.

59
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,677
Sorry, boss, I was cleaning the office.
Getting the booth ready for the tickets.

60
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,946
We're actually looking for a box
with the staff hoodies in it.

61
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,015
You haven't seen it, have you?

62
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,350
- Oh.
- Thank you, Rick.

63
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,486
No problem, boss.

64
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,222
- Oh.
- What, they look great.

65
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:32,359
You can't see that? I mean, honestly,
it's funny to you, isn't it?

66
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,095
It's not funny.
Who misspells "staff"?

67
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,165
Yeah, you know, give me a couple.
I'll take 'em to my brother and his friends.

68
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,268
That's a good idea.

69
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:44,105
- What a waste.
- All right, bye, boys.

70
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,304
Bye.

71
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,446
All right, look, Gene, I'm done.
Why don't you and Sarah finish up here.

72
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:56,548
I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go have
lunch, make a few phone calls, all right?

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,591
Yeah, just waiting for
that party tonight?

74
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,627
That's right, it's gonna
be a big-ass bonfire, man.

75
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,597
We're gonna get beer,
we're gonna get drunk off our asses.

76
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:10,965
Yeah!

77
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,600
Shit.

78
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,636
Yo, holla at your boy, bitch.

79
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,071
What?

80
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,735
All right, dick stick, we'll be there
in a bit, all right, calm down.

81
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:24,578
Douchebag! This son of a
fucking bitch right here.

82
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,549
He's just talking like, I don't know,
fucking creep-ass motherfucker.

83
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,543
Sounds like he's choking on...

84
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,655
Anyway, we gotta pick up
the tickets by the farm

85
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,922
before it gets too busy or some shit.

86
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,696
Don't you fucking move,
I swear to God.

87
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,239
What do I look like,
a hamster in a pet shop?

88
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,708
That's not very good
customer service.

89
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,977
Yeah, I reserve that kind of kindness
for actual paying customers,

90
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,780
not douchebags that
come for freebies.

91
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,049
I'm just having a thought here.
I'm thinking...

92
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,419
What if... what if she cut off her hair,
right, and took off those glasses.

93
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,156
Fixed up your face a little bit. You know,
you might actually be a hot piece of ass.

94
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,659
But I'm thinking, you might
have to go the whole way

95
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,094
and cut off your whole fucking head!

96
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:18,265
Oh, funny! You know what's even funnier?
I mean, even your boyfriends know,

97
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,468
the only vagina you've ever been
in is the one you came out of.

98
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,505
About nine months after about
a dozen other guys did.

99
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,241
It's so strange.
Everyone fucked your mom!

100
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,511
Fuck you, all right. Keep it up,
keep it up, that's funny.

101
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,080
- That's... fucking...
- Is there a problem here?

102
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,283
Yeah, this co-worker of yours is
being a real bitch about my ticket.

103
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,618
Really with this?

104
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,353
You look good down there...
like mother, like son.

105
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:43,090
Respect. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

106
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,227
But... whatever,
Donna Summers, all right?

107
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,629
Assholes!

108
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,365
It's Aretha Franklin,
you piece of shit.

109
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,967
Otis Redding.

110
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,702
It was originally an Otis
Redding song, "Respect."

111
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,670
The party's about to begin, boys.

112
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,871
- Show in five.
- Yes!

113
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,421
Eve.

114
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,160
What, what? What's going on?

115
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,962
They're laughing at...

116
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,298
Who's laughing at you,
who's laughing at you?

117
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:08,168
Sit down, okay, okay.

118
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,868
Making fun of me...

119
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,541
Who is making fun of you?

120
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,312
- They were looking through the window.
- I can't understand what you're saying.

121
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:22,115
They were by the window and
they were laughing at me.

122
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:26,387
- Out the window, who was out the window?
- I don't know.

123
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:31,823
And they saw your face, okay, okay.
Okay, that's okay.

124
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,261
Hey, what happened?

125
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,797
She said some guys were
outside the window.

126
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,932
They were making fun of her
when they saw her face.

127
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,368
Honey, you okay?

128
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,136
No.

129
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,337
- Which window, what...
- Over there, said there were guys out there.

130
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,310
What happened?

131
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,115
We're gonna find them, okay?

132
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,684
Look, I don't... honestly,
I don't see anything.

133
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,353
Hey, Gene, why don't
you go take a look?

134
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,489
Go around the left,
I'll go around the other way.

135
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,225
- We'll take a look.
- Okay.

136
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,692
Hey, be careful, okay?

137
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,133
- Find anything?
- No.

138
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,633
Shine the light here.

139
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,240
What are you guys doing?
I need help down there.

140
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,175
Somebody was looking at
Eve through the window.

141
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,578
- What?
- While she was getting dressed.

142
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:27,514
- Shit, who was it?
- Little bastards.

143
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,850
- What's going on?
- Do me a favor.

144
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,184
Go hold the store down
until we can get there.

145
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,620
- Yeah.
- Nicole might be out in a little bit.

146
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,789
- Matt, what's going on?
- Thanks, Gene.

147
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,294
Somebody was watching Eve through the
window while she was trying to get dressed.

148
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:43,398
- Eve?
- Yeah. Nicole's in there.

149
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,868
Listen, I'm gonna call
Dr. Young, okay, all right?

150
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,503
He's got the castings for your face.

151
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,472
We're gonna make a prosthetic
in a couple of days, all right?

152
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,580
But I look so ugly.

153
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,549
- And they saw me and...
- It's okay.

154
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,285
- And they saw... I'm ugly.
- It's all right, no, you don't.

155
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,787
Are you fucking kidding me?

156
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,508
This better be fucking good.

157
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,707
Yeah, who's this?

158
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:44,851
Oh yeah, of course, I'll be there.
I'm sorry for the attitude.

159
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:49,154
You sounded like some creepy
fuck I dated. Thanks.

160
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,374
Come in, door's open.

161
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:19,419
- Want some?
- Have I ever said yes?

162
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,154
- Then why do you continue to ask?
- Sorry.

163
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,193
Thank you.

164
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,899
Wasn't sure if I was gonna
be able to get them in time.

165
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,970
I don't get you. You had
all day for a pot break.

166
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,137
I guess I got a little
ahead of myself.

167
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,378
Now that you're here...

168
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,688
maybe you can stay
and hang out a bit?

169
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,891
Ash, please.

170
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,390
You know I'm with Kate.

171
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,465
You know the guy that...

172
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:07,198
called about the passes?

173
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,437
It was really, really creepy.

174
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,981
Does that turn you on?

175
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,657
Does it...

176
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:34,325
turn... you... on?

177
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:41,601
I guess the word "sister" means
nothing around here anymore.

178
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,504
What do you want me to say?
Joe asked me out.

179
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:48,175
You know damn well that
I still had feelings for him.

180
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,610
You could've thought about
your <i>sister</i> for once

181
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,180
instead of sneaking
around with my boyfriend.

182
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,857
He's not your boyfriend!
And he hasn't been for months...

183
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,486
Jesus Christ, you dumped him!
Or did you forget that?

184
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,022
- And who's sneaking around?
- You are... you are sneaking around.

185
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,846
- How long has it been?
- I was trying to tell you...

186
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:09,329
Why don't I just go ask Ashley.
She seems to know everything.

187
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,131
That slut needs to keep
her shit in her mouth.

188
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,031
Oh, so <i>she's</i> a slut?

189
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:20,373
Oh God, you're pathetic.
Was this your move?

190
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,808
Make this sound urgent?

191
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,448
Oh, please, like I wanted you
here alone in my bedroom.

192
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:38,291
I saw you with your little girlfriend's
sister at Rudy's last weekend.

193
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,827
We were talking, we're friends.

194
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:44,497
Sure... sure.

195
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,299
Why are you acting like
I did this on purpose?

196
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,035
I... I didn't mean for this
to happen, I swear to God.

197
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,471
All I was trying to do was
be a good friend to him.

198
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,109
- I... am your sister!
- I know.

199
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,245
Why don't you just go
back to your married men?

200
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,413
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

201
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,081
- Why would you say something like...
- Oh, what a...

202
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,920
Hello?

203
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,021
No, it's her sister.

204
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,856
- Give me the fucking phone.
- No.

205
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,322
Give it to me.

206
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,928
- Thanks.
- Who was it?

207
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,496
Your stupid fucking
farm friends, okay?

208
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,732
Your complimentary passes
are ready, princess.

209
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:22,833
You sure it wasn't one of
your elderly "gentlemen"?

210
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,508
We'll see who Joe
leaves with tonight.

211
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:35,348
You know... you always
do this shit. Always.

212
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,851
I mean, you could've picked up the
passes tonight when you got there.

213
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,320
I don't even know why
I'm still friends with you.

214
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,541
Don't flatter yourself.

215
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,385
I needed to pick up the passes

216
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,797
because that creep-o
guy from the farm...

217
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,379
Nice try.

218
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,497
I'll see you tonight.

219
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,137
Your loss.

220
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,890
Joe?

221
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,329
Shit.

222
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,233
Joe?

223
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,507
Christ, fuck.

224
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,685
Fucking window.

225
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,958
Thank you, Sarah, appreciate it.

226
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,505
Well...

227
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,434
Looks like it's bandages
through the weekend.

228
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,839
But we'll pick up your piece on
Monday, okay? I know, sweetie.

229
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,341
I know, I know, I'm so sorry.

230
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,877
- Hey, how is she?
- Hey.

231
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:13,917
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

232
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,186
It's all right. I think
it was that Rudy kid.

233
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:24,472
- It's okay. Eve.
- Okay.

234
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,764
- Okay.
- Eve, look.

235
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:33,300
- Eve, look, look.
- You remember your Penny doll?

236
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,268
And how much she meant to you?

237
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,664
Eve, it's gonna be okay, honey.

238
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,075
- I gotta head back up the store.
- Yeah, you go.

239
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,810
- You got her.
- I got her, go, go.

240
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,924
It's gonna be okay.

241
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,042
It's okay, I got her, go.

242
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:54,619
I think you're beautiful.

243
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,161
I need your help at the store, okay?

244
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:29,138
Someone's in the wrong decade.

245
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,594
The party has arrived!

246
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,464
Give them a beer! Give them
a beer, we gotta get drunk.

247
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,534
- Beer.
- Let's get it drunk.

248
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,735
- Would you like a beer?
- Yeah.

249
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,502
Thank you.

250
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,007
Give him a beer, we gotta get drunk!

251
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,676
Beer!

252
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,145
Really, guy? Why don't you
get your hands off her?

253
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,414
- Yo, I'm not gonna tell you twice.
- Come on, Joe, would you back off?

254
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,216
You need to have some respect for me.

255
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,852
If I see your hands on her again,
we're gonna have a problem.

256
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,354
Joe, can you sit down? Come on,
it's a party, just let her go.

257
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:05,358
- You can't show her a little respect?
- Relax, buddy, okay, relax.

258
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,594
She's a big girl,
she can take care of herself.

259
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:11,464
Yo, hey... can't we
all just get along?

260
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:13,634
- Cheers!
- That's what I'm saying.

261
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,969
Give me some of that, yeah.

262
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,638
Cheers.

263
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:19,839
Fuck yeah, booyah.

264
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,843
I'm fucking cold. Do you have a
sweater or a jacket or something?

265
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,476
- Please?
- Yes, all right... here.

266
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,684
- So demanding.
- Fuck off, Ashley.

267
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,088
- Nails come out on that one.
- You're such a whore.

268
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,690
- Here's a couple extra.
- Thank you.

269
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,392
Good thing your sister
fucked up the order

270
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:43,496
- and put staff with two "Ts" and an "F."
- Good call.

271
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,115
Isn't that how staph
infection is spelled?

272
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,002
Where the fuck is my weed?

273
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,503
Asshole.

274
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,406
Oh, the hostility, really?

275
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:56,409
I just smoked you out a little bit ago.
You should be nice to me.

276
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:59,712
Yeah, I will when I get my fucking shit.
I gave you 200 bucks for an ounce.

277
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,415
- Where the fuck is it?
- I didn't blow your money, all right?

278
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,751
My boy didn't show up yet.

279
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,486
Well, is he coming?

280
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,623
These are for him, all right?

281
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:12,859
- What, all those are for him?
- No, they're not all for him, douche.

282
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,859
- Douche?
- Ba-douche.

283
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,697
She wants me, man, she wants me.

284
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,999
Yeah, I'm sure, but listen.
When you're talking about the tickets,

285
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,634
can you please keep it on
the down low, all right?

286
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,137
Nicole will kill me if
she knew I took them.

287
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,507
- God, killing me with this, dude.
- I'm being serious, all right?

288
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:31,544
Why don't we all meet up at 11:30?
Go get our haunted hotel rocks off.

289
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,613
Yo, you did clear the party
with your sister, right?

290
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,416
Oh, yeah, this is cool, definitely cool.
They're not using us this year.

291
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:40,787
They're using the clown house. Next year
there's gonna be a pirate ship or something?

292
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:43,356
- It's good.
- Joe, what the fuck?

293
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,826
- What it... What's wrong with you guys?
- Keep touching her.

294
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,713
- Keep it up.
- Joe, what the fuck?

295
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,332
Hostility over here.

296
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:57,737
- Hey, come here, Ashley. Give me a hug.
- In your dreams.

297
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:01,241
Yeah, I'm gonna cut off your balls
until you get me my shit. I'm serious.

298
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,210
All right, hey, Tina! Your turn.

299
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,047
Baby doll, not in this lifetime.

300
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,445
I'll give you a kiss.

301
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:13,553
I knew you went both ways.
I don't doubt you'd make out with him.

302
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:16,856
But in the meantime, let's see some clowns?
So can we go see this new exhibit?

303
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,692
You guys can go ahead and have fun.
I'm terrified of clowns.

304
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,261
I thought it was midgets
that terrified you.

305
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:25,265
Everything freaks her out, clowns,
midgets. Belly button lint, you name it.

306
00:24:25,365 --> 00:24:27,297
All right, I got one.

307
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,036
A midget clown chasing a stray cat.

308
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,539
Oh, come on, Rudy, I like cats.

309
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:35,008
That was weird.

310
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,376
We outta here, so where we going?

311
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,012
Do you guys wanna go
check out the corn maze?

312
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,112
Where we going? Corn maze?

313
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,440
Fuck me, the cornfield maze.

314
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,575
It's a big dead cow, come on.

315
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,144
All right, yo-yo-yo, I'm gonna
sit this one out, all right?

316
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,313
- I got my boy rolling in right now.
- Are you serious?

317
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,782
- No, I'll meet up with you guys later.
- I'm coming with you.

318
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,651
You can't... you know...
Ashley, you know you can't come.

319
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,953
He's gonna split if I'm not alone.

320
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,123
Come on.

321
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,459
All right, you know what, hey,
let's burn one before I go.

322
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,328
- Now you're talking.
- There you go, right?

323
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:30,196
Losers.

324
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,398
Yeah, have fun on
the magic school bus.

325
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,599
Enjoy your date in hell,
go ahead, real scary.

326
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,475
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

327
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,277
Oh, my God!

328
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,927
I'm not afraid.

329
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:50,316
- Take her, she's all yours!
- Oh, my God!

330
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,654
- Don't you like clowns?
- She loves clowns, don't ya?

331
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,849
You're such an asshole!

332
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,694
Look at the awesome spot I got,
come, come, come, come.

333
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,614
Welcome.

334
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,003
Ashley, you will not believe
the shit that happened to me.

335
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,872
Fuck happened to you?

336
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,048
It was...

337
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,642
tonight... oh, careful.

338
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,049
I saw Eve tonight.
Fucking seriously scary.

339
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:27,420
I saw her without the mask thing.
Scared the shit out of me.

340
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,057
- You scared? I don't believe it.
- No shit, man.

341
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:36,496
I'm serious, man, I'm serious.
She had the whole half the face off.

342
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,732
You don't wanna do that, scary.

343
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:43,033
Matthew, like, hit her
with his tractor.

344
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,757
You know what's weird? Is...

345
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:56,149
They keep inviting us back every
single year. Why do they do that?

346
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,387
I don't fucking know.

347
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,954
I mean... yeah, it's weird.

348
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:10,303
Yeah, Ash, I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for Roy and you guys.

349
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,329
Oh, dude.

350
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:16,071
I gotta get going.

351
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:18,571
- Okay.
- You know why.

352
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,141
- Text me when you're done and...
- What?

353
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:25,578
And we'll meet by the greenhouse.
The thingy with the scary moss people.

354
00:27:25,678 --> 00:27:29,582
Scary moss people, they got moss
people there. Shit, I didn't even know.

355
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,084
I'm just gonna finish this up and I'm
gonna catch up with the other guys.

356
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,253
Lots of scary people,
I can stay with you.

357
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,755
- No need.
- No, no need?

358
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,390
- No, just meet me over there.
- All right.

359
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,260
- Get the good stuff.
- The good stuff, come on.

360
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,629
- I know, I'm just saying.
- I got what you need.

361
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:44,797
Sure.

362
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,632
- You doubt me for a second?
- Not for a second.

363
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:49,535
That hurts me. Deep down
in here... all right.

364
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:50,803
- Stay good, all right?
- Yup.

365
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,173
I'll meet you soon.
You're gonna miss me.

366
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:55,975
I already miss you, go!

367
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:59,042
Good, good, all right, I'm just
checking, I'm just checking.

368
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,339
Right up here.

369
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,742
Good shit, our boy is on the way.

370
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,878
A hook-up for a hook-up, baby.

371
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,779
- Yeah.
- Come on.

372
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,374
Hold on.

373
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,177
Come on, hold on.

374
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,338
Jerome?

375
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,037
- Shit!
- I scared the shit out of you.

376
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,972
- What the... oh, man.
- What's up, Rudy?

377
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,141
- How you doing?
- What the fuck is up?

378
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,144
It's my little cousin,
Marty, man, he's cool.

379
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,613
- Dap it up with him.
- What's up, dude?

380
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:11,017
Marty's becoming a man tonight.
I'm gonna get him high for the first time.

381
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,519
Oh, yeah, this man's getting high?

382
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,089
Yeah, man, off that kush.

383
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,691
Did you see this shit?
Aberzombie and Twitch.

384
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:20,860
- That's...
- Fuck, this place is lame.

385
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,263
I gotta sit the fuck down.
I just hit my leg on this dumb-ass...

386
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,732
He's like, yo, this is
where I got this shit.

387
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,869
- So what the fuck you been up to, Rudy?
- You know me.

388
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,271
I got this honey all up
on me, tonight, y'all.

389
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,609
- He's finally getting some pussy?
- Finally getting... get out of here.

390
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,444
'Bout time, motherfucker.

391
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:39,712
You got my weed?

392
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:42,581
Yeah, man, you know,
I'm the go-to guy.

393
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:45,785
- You know he's the go-to guy.
- The question is...

394
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:49,655
do you have the VIP tickets for
me and my cuz and the cash?

395
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,391
You doubt me,
do you doubt me, really?

396
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,632
- This 350?
- You said 300, dude, like...

397
00:29:59,732 --> 00:30:03,235
I'm just fucking with you.
Just trying to make a couple extra dollars.

398
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,738
- I got it.
- Right?

399
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,174
Some kush.

400
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:11,061
Oh, no shit. You are full of it.

401
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:13,346
Yo, man... Can I smell it?

402
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:17,516
He ain't gonna know the fucking
difference. Put that shit away.

403
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,751
Marty, Marty.

404
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:22,788
Yo, you should be honored to be on
the first joint of his first joint.

405
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,791
I feel privileged, Marty.

406
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,327
This is how you do it,
Marty, you watch me.

407
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,596
- Oh, my God.
- That's that shit!

408
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,901
Now you tell me that's some bullshit.

409
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,504
Exactly. Hits you
right there, don't it?

410
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,940
Now, I just like...

411
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,174
I already showed you
what the fuck to do.

412
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,978
Don't embarrass me... hit it,
then go... like your mom's coming.

413
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:47,713
Hit that shit.

414
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,054
Virgin lungs over here.
Give me the fucking joint.

415
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:58,093
Hit it one more time!
Hit it one more time.

416
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:00,059
- No.
- Fucking virgin lungs.

417
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,328
All right, all right, man,
I gotta go meet Ashley, dude.

418
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:05,665
- You gonna be at the party later?
- Yeah, listen. We're gonna...

419
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,266
We're gonna use these VIP tickets

420
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,169
and hit the fucking hayride and
see what this shit is all about.

421
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,171
- You'll love it, you'll love it.
- You call me later.

422
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,873
Marty, you ready?

423
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:18,108
Marty! Motherfucker's
high off one hit, Jesus.

424
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,747
- To the hayride!
- Yo, catch you later, man.

425
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,316
All right, call me!

426
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,045
Eve? I heard a noise,
what's going on?

427
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:57,014
Just some of the local kids.
They left.

428
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,221
Are you okay?

429
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,156
Listen, I know what happened tonight.

430
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,792
And I promise you,
I'm gonna take care of it.

431
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,365
Tommy, don't look at me.

432
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,137
Hey... I am looking at you.

433
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,546
You're the only girl
I've ever looked at.

434
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,052
Listen...

435
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:40,312
We need to have a talk with
Matt and Nicole about us.

436
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,262
Are you sure you feel that way?

437
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:46,563
I've never been more sure about
anything in my entire life.

438
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,900
Listen, I gotta go.

439
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,328
Oh, shit.

440
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,581
- That was so scary.
- You're so brave. Get over here.

441
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,484
What are we doing in here?

442
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,923
- We can't do anything in here.
- Stop it.

443
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,323
What if somebody sees us?

444
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,500
Oh, my God, that was crazy.
Did you see his face in there?

445
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,935
Oh, my God.

446
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:26,419
Oh, hey, hey, I gotta call Patrick.
He just texted me saying...

447
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,442
Oh, typical, real typical.
You have a boyfriend.

448
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:32,678
- Yeah, whatever.
- Whatever, these things are so cool.

449
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,146
I'm gonna be right back.

450
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:37,247
- Do I look funny?
- I gotta take a piss.

451
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,719
Oh, my God... Wait,
where'd you... come on!

452
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,752
What do you think you're doing...
that's my sister, you piece of shit!

453
00:33:53,852 --> 00:33:56,769
Joe! Joe, what the
fuck are you doing?!

454
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,375
Chill the fuck out!

455
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,144
That's enough!

456
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,012
This is the way you thank us?

457
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:10,113
We give you free tickets and you
come in here and act like a fool?

458
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,884
Nicole, we got a couple locals
fighting down here at the pig shack.

459
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,527
It's under control.
It's your step-brother again.

460
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,029
- I didn't do shit, I...
- Be quiet, Roy.

461
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,166
You know damn well if it wasn't
for Nicole, I'd call the cops.

462
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,366
- Touch her again, huh?
- Hey!

463
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,806
Yeah, man, I'm sorry.

464
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:35,507
What are you apologizing for?

465
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,511
My asshole brother came out
of nowhere and attacked you!

466
00:34:38,611 --> 00:34:44,016
Okay, he's your brother. He saw Roy
groping your ass. I don't blame him.

467
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,919
Fuck off, Tina, Jesus Christ,
you're just as stupid as he is,

468
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:49,388
and I hate this damn macho shit, God!

469
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,090
That's enough!

470
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,472
Eve, take Roy and his girlfriend up to the
store and get 'em cleaned up, all right?

471
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,105
Hey, boss, you all right?

472
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:00,695
Yeah, just a little scuffle.

473
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,704
- Keep an eye on this one.
- Will do, boss.

474
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:06,303
Get out of here!

475
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,854
Hi. Did you find Sarah?

476
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,690
Yeah, I did.

477
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,628
- I don't know how this keeps happening.
- Maybe she had to pee.

478
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,264
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about you.

479
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:36,302
I'm used to her disappearing.
Every year, it's something with you.

480
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,237
Honestly, Nicole,
it wasn't his fault.

481
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,239
We were just holding hands
and Joe freaked out.

482
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,709
You were just holding hands?
Seriously?

483
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,811
You wonder why Matt
has a problem with you.

484
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,247
- I'm sorry, Nick.
- I'm going to the car to get my phone.

485
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:51,951
- Hey, wait a second, I'll go with you.
- No, please just give me some time.

486
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,119
I need to find Joe, I need to
give him... cool him off...

487
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:58,390
- Hey, fuck that motherfucker, all right?
- Hey, hey! Really?

488
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,026
Your language... I got customers
on the other side of this wall.

489
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,528
Sorry.

490
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,629
- Fine, go, text me.
- All right.

491
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:10,970
I wanna go to the corn maze.

492
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,072
Okay. Just be careful and
take your flashlight with you.

493
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:18,678
Please, make sure Sarah's out there.

494
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,386
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

495
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:27,486
Do you wanna not tell my dad about this?
You know how he gets with me.

496
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,319
I'm not gonna say anything.

497
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:35,761
Don't tell his dad what?
What happened?

498
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:40,430
Nothing, just a big brother protecting
his not so innocent little sister.

499
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,768
Where's Eve?

500
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:46,672
Oh, she went to go look after Matt.
He broke up the scuffle.

501
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,141
I'm gonna go look for her.

502
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,110
You mean Matt.

503
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,978
- Yeah.
- Yeah... God.

504
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,344
Ashley?

505
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,594
Yo, come on. Rudy's got your weed?

506
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:34,586
You're gonna like what Rudy got you,
girl. This shit, oh my God!

507
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:41,360
Rudy, Rudy will not die
until dead pigs do fly.

508
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,898
Rudy, Rudy will not die
until dead pigs do fly.

509
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:50,769
Rudy, Rudy will not die
until dead pigs do fly.

510
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,074
Rudy, Rudy will not die
until dead pigs do fly.

511
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:59,078
Rudy, Rudy will not die
until dead pigs do fly.

512
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:03,513
Rudy, Rudy will not die
until dead pigs do fly.

513
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,053
All right, so you
witches like to party?

514
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:11,493
Yes.

515
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:14,294
Oh, big Rudy's got a party for you.

516
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:21,233
What's that I smell?
I like what I smell.

517
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:26,805
Smoking some weed, girls, without Rudy?
Without Rudy, there is no weed.

518
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,904
It's...

519
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:31,922
Ashley?

520
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,421
No shit, Ashley?

521
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,317
Damn.

522
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,352
Ashley.

523
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,851
What's up?

524
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,074
Rudy.

525
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,231
I've got a surprise for you, Rudy.

526
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:55,332
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

527
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,641
- I come from the other side, Rudy.
- Yeah, the other side?

528
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:04,307
Open your mouth, show me your tongue.

529
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,687
Relax. Can you really feel that?

530
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,663
Yeah, I feel that.

531
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,493
- Do you know how hot you are, Rudy?
- You like that?

532
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:25,428
I want you so bad.

533
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,236
How you feeling, Rudy?

534
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:32,471
Yeah.

535
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,474
My stuff's so much better than yours.

536
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,875
Yeah, take it off.

537
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,883
Feeling it now? Feeling it now, Rudy?

538
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:47,953
You could have any girl
in the world, Rudy.

539
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,789
- I'm right here.
- I want you.

540
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,088
- I'm right here.
- I want you.

541
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:58,094
Oh, you're so hot.
Rudy, you're so hot.

542
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,607
Ashley?

543
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,987
What the fuck, Ashley?

544
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,215
Ashley, where'd the fuck you go?

545
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,981
Oh, my God.

546
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,754
- Fuck, Ashley?
- Hi, Rudy.

547
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,690
You?

548
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,640
Ashley's heart belongs to Joe.

549
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:31,894
- What?
- Who needs Ashley when you have me?

550
00:40:33,196 --> 00:40:34,364
That's right.

551
00:40:37,195 --> 00:40:42,276
You've been a bad boy, Rudy.
Time to be fucking punished.

552
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,444
- You'll get punished.
- Punished?

553
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,346
- You wanna be punished?
- Yeah.

554
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:50,183
Yeah? Yeah?

555
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:52,681
Oh, yeah.

556
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:55,888
Yeah.

557
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,962
Ashley's heart belongs to Joe.

558
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:04,625
What the fuck?

559
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:08,732
Blood on Joe's head will flow.

560
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,295
Ashley loves and Ashley dies.

561
00:41:13,372 --> 00:41:17,008
Ashley's innards on the floor do lie.

562
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,352
What is wrong with you?

563
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,221
- Get in the car.
- Fuck.

564
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,890
- What is the matter with you?
- Joe is a fucking asshole, seriously.

565
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,229
He's fucking fighting with Roy again.
What the fuck is that?

566
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:36,995
- Joe again, you're always fighting with Joe.
- Well, it fucking pisses me off.

567
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,809
I don't know, is he trying to
impress me or Tina? Jesus Christ.

568
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:43,668
Geez, you need to calm down a little bit
and big Rudy's got a little something?

569
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,204
I mean, does he even like
me or does he like Tina?

570
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:47,773
- I don't know, I don't know shit about Tina.
- 'Cause it doesn't impress me.

571
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,575
Look, just take a little of this...

572
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,944
- I don't smoke pot.
- You don't smoke pot, you never smoke pot.

573
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,479
- You and your Christian parents...
- No, I never smoke pot.

574
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,115
...don't smoke pot,
'cause you're a good girl.

575
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,918
You're too good,
you're too good for Rudy.

576
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,489
- Yeah, I'm too good for Rudy, whatever.
- That's right, you follow all the rules.

577
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,091
Is there something wrong with you?

578
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,928
- It's nothing wrong with me...
- You're just high in a car by yourself.

579
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,231
Yes, I'm high in a car by myself,
oh, no, call the police.

580
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,201
I don't think I need to call them 'cause
they could just drive by any minute.

581
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,303
- I don't know why you're smoking in the car.
- Oh, I see, you know what?

582
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:21,940
- I could roll this up right here...
- Jesus Christ, what if Tommy comes by?

583
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,677
- Rudy, are you an idiot?
- Oh, please, enough with that.

584
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,145
- You know, really?
- No, seriously.

585
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,548
All right, you know what,
you want a little privacy?

586
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:33,752
You don't want this around?
You ever been on the hayride trail?

587
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,954
No, I've never been
on the hayride trail.

588
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,524
Oh, I see, so you never been
to the biohazard place.

589
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,593
No, I've never been to
the biohazard place.

590
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,662
So if you and me went
to the biohazard place,

591
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,565
- very secretly, very quietly...
- Very quietly.

592
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:50,168
- took a little taste, would you join me?
- Joe would kick your ass.

593
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,603
Joe wouldn't know about it
'cause I wouldn't tell Joe.

594
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,213
Fuck it, let's go smoke us some pot.

595
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:02,987
Let's go.

596
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,090
Goddammit, Rudy,
where the fuck are you?

597
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,590
Christ.

598
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:27,269
You scared me.

599
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:35,545
Okay, don't you have... someone
else to go scare now or something?

600
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,084
Hello?

601
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,458
Can you at least tell me where the
greenhouse is? I have to meet a friend th...

602
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:49,125
Very funny.

603
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,084
Somebody!

604
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:24,560
Somebody help me!

605
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,298
Please.

606
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:35,855
Please!

607
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,818
Help me, someone!

608
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:14,944
Rudy!

609
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:32,264
Now this is the perfect climate
to grow my weed in, bro.

610
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:34,766
- Perfect climate.
- Check it out.

611
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:36,301
Oh, shit!

612
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:39,304
Oh, shit!

613
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,940
This is a, Venus flytrap.

614
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,377
- I learned about this in school.
- It's like a penis flytrap.

615
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:50,415
- It's a giant fucking vagina.
- That's what it is, it's like a giant pussy.

616
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:55,184
A fucking man could get
lost in that thing. Jesus.

617
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,255
What the fuck?

618
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,993
- Please, help me.
- Is she real?

619
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:09,768
What are you doing? Hold on,
you crazy bitch, get off of him.

620
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,300
My new pants.

621
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,672
Is that her fucking intestines?

622
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,413
Oh, shit.

623
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,947
- Is he taking her the fuck away?
- Oh, shit.

624
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,752
Oh, my God,
what the fuck is going on?

625
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,224
- Yo, these actors here...
- Shit is real.

626
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:36,061
- ...they deserve Oscars.
- This shit is so fucking real.

627
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:38,296
Fantastic, let's go...
let's go get these guys.

628
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,252
Come on.

629
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,702
Jesus Christ.

630
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,840
It's a fucking mess.

631
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,825
- It's gonna be so fun.
- Hell, yeah.

632
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:09,294
Let's go, motherfuckers!

633
00:47:10,095 --> 00:47:11,830
Will you watch your language?

634
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,865
All right, I'll watch
my fucking language.

635
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,866
- Hey, why don't you watch your tongue?
- Watch your tongue.

636
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:31,282
Oh, yo, we gotta find Ashley.
Yo, I told her I'd meet up with her.

637
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,251
- She's gonna be pissed.
- Oh, no.

638
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,087
Better pissed off than pissed on.

639
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,323
- That's not even funny.
- I know.

640
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:41,357
- Like, you are so stoned.
- I'm so tired.

641
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,562
Hey, come on, yo,
we gotta find Ashley.

642
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:47,365
I texted her, you know how
she gets, she gets crazy.

643
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:51,288
- Again? My legs feel funny.
- She get crazy in the head.

644
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:54,572
- I know...
- I think I can fly.

645
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,442
- Really?
- Nope, didn't work.

646
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,508
You sure are gone?

647
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,549
Look, all right,
you clearly are incapacitated.

648
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,485
You stay here.

649
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:12,491
I'm gonna go find Ashley.
I will bring her back here.

650
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:15,293
So you stay put, all right?

651
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:19,197
Tell Joe to come. 'Cause he
has to try this, it's so cool.

652
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,199
Yeah, if I see him,
I'll tell him where you are.

653
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:22,300
Okay, thank you.

654
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,902
- You hold onto that.
- Okay.

655
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,170
In case, you know, you feel like

656
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,239
- smoking the marijuana.
- I will hold it.

657
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,807
I'll call you.

658
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,175
All right.

659
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:34,112
You be careful,
don't move, stay here.

660
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:37,148
Watch for the hayride tractors.
Don't cross the road.

661
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,582
- Look both ways.
- Okay.

662
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,418
Don't get hurt.

663
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,958
I'm so tired.

664
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:52,330
Joe... that was so fast.

665
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,233
I... oh, I s...

666
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,136
I was sitting here,
my friend was right there.

667
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:01,473
I was just tired, so I was
just resting my eyes.

668
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,875
Rudy!

669
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,651
Yo, Kerone. Damn pipe just
went right through her.

670
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,702
Look at this place.

671
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,879
- All right, they're not in here, let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

672
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:18,783
Maybe you could stay in here with me

673
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:21,086
- for a little bit.
- But they're...

674
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:25,487
No, I mean, just, I mean...
you and me.

675
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,019
What are you doing?

676
00:50:29,995 --> 00:50:31,728
I don't know.

677
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,371
- Come on, really?
- Whatever, you know...

678
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,985
Get this off.

679
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,599
Shit.

680
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:39,728
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

681
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,467
I can't.

682
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:45,803
But you were already doing it.

683
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:49,871
- What is your problem?
- I'm with Kate.

684
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,278
My sister is a fucking prude, okay?

685
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:57,112
Besides, we were together
long before you and her.

686
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,853
No. You don't wanna
date a jock, remember?

687
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:07,089
- You broke up with me.
- Oh, that was a long time ago.

688
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,707
Besides, some guy's
been calling her anyway.

689
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:15,600
When?

690
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,149
I don't know, right before we left.

691
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,705
He was all creepy.

692
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:24,609
And breathing hard on the phone.

693
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,111
She pretended she didn't
know him, yeah, right.

694
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:28,780
Wait.

695
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,447
- Get off.
- What?

696
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,905
Kate's with another guy?

697
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:37,176
What do you want me to say?

698
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:41,426
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

699
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:44,150
Hey, Joe, I didn't say he was here.

700
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,900
Fuck.

701
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,818
You came back.

702
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:22,934
I thought you would.

703
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:26,471
Just didn't think it would
take you this long.

704
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,171
All right, well...

705
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,092
What?

706
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:38,156
The cigarette? Fuck's sake,
Joe, I'm putting it out, okay?

707
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,119
Come here.

708
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:43,119
Let's resume.

709
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:50,962
Joe, stop it. Joe,
Joe, stop it, get off.

710
00:53:51,363 --> 00:53:54,032
Get off of me, Joe, stop!

711
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,770
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

712
00:54:33,738 --> 00:54:37,506
Oh, that was so realistic.
This is gonna be so...

713
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:51,089
- No, thank you.
- You sure? I got the good shit.

714
00:54:51,189 --> 00:54:53,391
I'm sorry, I just prefer not to.

715
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,694
Well, what would you prefer to do?

716
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:59,497
Hey, why don't you
leave the girl alone?

717
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:03,067
Relax, man, we're just having
a good time. Marty, come here.

718
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,603
Hey, why don't you
leave the girl alone?

719
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:08,103
Yo, man, chill the fuck out.

720
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:18,316
Hey, yo, Joe. Hey, man.

721
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:21,219
- Yo, Kate's looking for you.
- Where the hell is she?

722
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:25,256
No, we were just at... I mean,
all of us were just hanging out

723
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,658
by the biohazard place on
the hayride trail, man.

724
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,228
- Is she still up there?
- Yeah, man, I just left her, dude.

725
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:34,298
I'm gonna go find Ashley and we
are gonna smoke us up some more.

726
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:38,003
What... smoke what?
Is Kate smoking weed?

727
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:42,306
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- What, she's a big girl, dude.

728
00:55:42,406 --> 00:55:45,076
Listen, you stoner piece of shit.
If anything happens to her,

729
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,311
I'm gonna smash your ass
and smoke it, you hear me?

730
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,147
- Hey, man!
- What?

731
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:53,284
- What's going on?
- I don't know, dude's high-strung.

732
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:57,288
Said he wanted to smoke my ass.
I mean, what the hell is that?

733
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:01,192
- What are you on?
- What? No, I...

734
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:02,660
- I was looking for food.
- Shut up.

735
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,062
- And I was...
- Please, please.

736
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:09,133
- Please, just shut up.
- Guys. What's going on?

737
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:10,601
I don't know, maybe we
should call Tommy over

738
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,470
and see if we can figure out
what little Rudy's here on?

739
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,939
I didn't... I wasn't doing anything.

740
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,142
You didn't do anything. You're just
like your parents, you know that?

741
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:22,213
Total disregard for everything. Drinking,
smoking. It's all a joke to you, isn't it?

742
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,248
- No, I...
- Isn't it?

743
00:56:24,348 --> 00:56:27,218
- It wasn't, it...
- Hey, guys, come on, okay?

744
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,620
Seriously, come on, hey, babe,
go check on Eve, all right?

745
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,623
She went down to the wardrobe
trailer to check on Roy and Sarah.

746
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,490
I need the fresh air anyway.

747
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:38,660
- I'll see if I can find Sarah too.
- Okay.

748
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:43,468
- It's getting ridiculous.
- What, just...

749
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:45,761
What was that all about?

750
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:47,805
Nothing.

751
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:52,109
What do my parents have to do with this?
Is he gonna call my dad again, he can't...

752
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,712
Can you just calm down for a second?
He's not gonna call anybody, okay?

753
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:57,663
- He's just upset.
- What is he so upset about?

754
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,858
He's upset about Eve's accident.

755
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:06,157
Why is he upset about that?

756
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:11,596
Well, you and your friends' parents
weren't the nicest kids back then, okay?

757
00:57:11,696 --> 00:57:13,598
I didn't do anything.

758
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,735
You never do anything.
Did you do anything tonight?

759
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,470
I... I...

760
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,106
Get out of here.

761
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:24,806
- I... I...
- Get out of here.

762
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,876
Try to behave yourself, all right?

763
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:31,949
Where's Sarah?

764
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,579
Oh, she said she was gonna grab
some register tape from the shop.

765
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,082
Get the smoke machine, Sarah.

766
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:54,370
Get the tickets, kiss my ass.

767
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,236
Hello?

768
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,715
Somebody's in here.
Probably doing your fucking job!

769
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:07,418
Goddamn, it's so dark in this...

770
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,486
This is disgusting.

771
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:16,328
I should just do everybody's job here
because that's what I do... Fuck!

772
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:19,861
Are you guys serious?

773
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,968
I think I lost my glasses, thank you!

774
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,472
These stupid dummies aren't
even supposed to be in here.

775
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:30,138
They're just gonna get
dirty and fucked up.

776
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,515
Damn.

777
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,119
Oh, fuck.

778
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,560
Oh, come on.

779
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,807
Oh, God. I hate Halloween.

780
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:06,544
I'm gonna hit the Easter
bunny in the fucking head.

781
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,524
Biohazard.

782
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,696
What kind of hayride is this?

783
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,400
Ashley? Shit.

784
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,137
Ash, where you at?

785
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,146
Yo, Ash?

786
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:46,248
Yo, dude, come on, don't be mad,
all right? Look, I got hung up.

787
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,919
Fuck. Shit.

788
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:52,832
Damn.

789
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:03,344
Shit.

790
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:07,805
Joe, look, I didn't force her to smoke,
all right? She wanted to...

791
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:12,777
Hey, where is she, where's Kate?
And where's this biohazard place?

792
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:15,112
That's right, mister "hayrides suck"

793
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:17,882
doesn't know where he's going
'cause he can't ride on a wagon.

794
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,955
Would you shut up?
Look, when did you leave her,

795
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:24,221
and I swear if there's one hair wrong
on her head, I'm coming after you.

796
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:28,059
Just calm yourself down.
Did you call her?

797
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:31,128
Yeah, like, 50 times.

798
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:35,399
Well, maybe she passed out.
I mean, she did have a lot to smo...

799
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:37,201
She was tired and she...

800
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:40,238
- I swear, when I find you...
- Calm down, where are you?

801
01:00:40,538 --> 01:00:42,440
Like some church thing?

802
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,944
Oh, no shit! Did you see
the floating coffin guy?

803
01:00:47,044 --> 01:00:51,348
- Oh, I think he's kick-ass, dude.
- I'm gonna bad-ass you in a minute.

804
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:54,619
What's your problem, man? Come on.

805
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:56,887
All right, okay.

806
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,458
If you're looking at the...
church thing,

807
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,261
where the kick-ass
skeleton pallbearers, by the way,

808
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:06,931
that I wish I had in my
room 'cause they look...

809
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:09,366
- Look, Rudy.
- All right, whatever.

810
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:13,037
If you're looking at the church thing,
you wanna go to your right.

811
01:01:13,537 --> 01:01:14,803
So it's close?

812
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,777
It's a ways, dude,
just... keep walking.

813
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:23,747
All right, and watch out for those crazy
assholes driving the hayride tractors.

814
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,388
They drive like my mother.

815
01:01:25,488 --> 01:01:29,451
<i>I'm gonna meet up with you. I'm gonna
find Ashley, and I'm gonna come your way.</i>

816
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:34,723
Oh, yo.

817
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,730
Oh, shit.

818
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,669
Bloody chips.

819
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:46,434
This place is kick-ass every year.

820
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,005
Kate?

821
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,505
Kate?

822
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:03,405
Donna? Hi.

823
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:08,419
God, I haven't... seen you around
the farm since we were kids.

824
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:10,721
Yeah, I know.

825
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:14,291
My girls... I just wanna drop
these coats off for them.

826
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,994
They may have texted a little
while ago asking for them?

827
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:20,631
But they didn't tell me
where to meet them.

828
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,001
You know what, leave them with me,
it's okay. I'll give it to them.

829
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:28,005
- I'm sure they're gonna come this way.
- No, it's fine. I brought Kate's extra key.

830
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:32,176
Did you look in the back?
Maybe alongside the building?

831
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:34,209
Oh, okay.

832
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,550
Laura, I'm gonna go check
on my brother. Are you okay?

833
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,850
- Yeah, I'm fine, don't worry about it.
- Okay.

834
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,521
What the fuck are you doing?

835
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:55,499
Get the...

836
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,135
It's the end of the ride
for you two clowns.

837
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:02,805
Yo!

838
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:06,477
Driver, you can go now.

839
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:08,712
- Trash is off.
- Fuck you!

840
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,682
I'll see you when it
goes back around.

841
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:13,784
Fucking punk!

842
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,687
What the fuck was that about?

843
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:20,622
- I have no fucking idea.
- I'm gonna beat his fucking ass.

844
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,498
Damn, it's good.

845
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:30,365
Oh, a frickin' mess, though.

846
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,938
What have we got here?

847
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,178
No food?

848
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:44,345
That's a bunch of shit
like my mother would buy.

849
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:49,034
What?

850
01:04:49,953 --> 01:04:53,924
What... I'll pick up the trash, all right?
I just... that bag isn't even mine.

851
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:55,392
I didn't wanna buy that crap.

852
01:04:56,827 --> 01:05:00,731
Hey, I don't mean crap.
It's not crap.

853
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:03,300
I'm just saying, man.

854
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,570
I'll pick everything up, all right?

855
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:08,736
Damn, fine, just slow down, man.

856
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:14,144
Get away from me, all right,
get away from me. Somebody!

857
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,891
What are you doing?

858
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,088
Get away from me, all right?

859
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,955
What do you want?

860
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:36,333
Help!

861
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,069
Stay away... stay the
fuck away from me!

862
01:05:41,472 --> 01:05:44,875
What do you want?
What do you want from me?

863
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:48,443
Just get the fuck away!
Fucking crazy!

864
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,983
No, no, no, no.

865
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,320
No, no, no!

866
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:59,187
Help me, help me!

867
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,358
No, please, please, please...

868
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:43,901
- Shit was real as hell!
- It was so fucking real.

869
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:46,236
What the fuck is on your face, dude?

870
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:49,139
I don't know, it's part of the whole
fucking thing. This is awesome.

871
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:53,610
- This setup is fucking awesome, bro.
- This is so realistic.

872
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,513
- What the fuck is going on here?
- This is great.

873
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,348
This is fucking crazy.

874
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:01,649
Yo, does that look like
Rudy's jacket to you?

875
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,087
That is Rudy's fucking jacket.

876
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:11,295
Oh, he must work here.
That's how he got us the free passes!

877
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:14,729
- Oh, that's how we got in here.
- Rudy!

878
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,669
Hey, did you find the girls?

879
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:21,405
No, just... stopped for a breather.

880
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:25,442
Check the petting zoo, actually.
Just go up and around to the right.

881
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,342
- Thanks again.
- Sure, I'll see you.

882
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:41,491
Donna?

883
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,224
Beth.

884
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,463
It's so good to see you.

885
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,066
Oh, my goodness,
what are you doing here?

886
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,173
- The girls are cold.
- Ashley, too.

887
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,537
Haven't seen her since
the kids graduated.

888
01:07:53,637 --> 01:07:55,539
Yeah, she went off to college,
she's living in those dorms.

889
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:58,008
- Mine are still at home.
- Oh.

890
01:07:58,108 --> 01:07:59,441
How 'bout this place?

891
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:16,693
- My girls rave about it every year.
- I just don't get this horror th...

892
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,226
Beth?

893
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:29,373
Sorry about earlier. I...

894
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:31,906
I'm definitely feeling a lot better.

895
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,910
No, no, please, no!

896
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:39,717
Beth!

897
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:49,589
Hey, wake up. We gotta go,
we're closing up, get up.

898
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,332
Hey, what...

899
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:40,408
Help! Help me, please!

900
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:45,779
Oh, God, no! Leave me alone!

901
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:58,562
Donna? What's going on, it's Tommy.

902
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:02,063
Tommy. Where are my girls?

903
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,549
Can anyone help me?

904
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:35,423
God, my babies!

905
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,144
Why!?

906
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,865
What did they have to do with you?

907
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,406
Nicole, help!

908
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:52,674
Oh, my God.

909
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,473
Look what he's done... He's coming!

910
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:02,586
What is going on?!

911
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:05,920
He's gonna kill me, oh God!

912
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,427
You bastard!

913
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:14,064
- Matthew!
- You killed my babies!

914
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,765
Matthew!

915
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,647
Daddy...

916
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:39,947
No!

917
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,258
Here, take Penny.

918
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,331
No!

919
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,801
No!

920
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:12,458
All right, Miss Donna. I finished
my rounds and as promised,

921
01:13:12,558 --> 01:13:16,361
no more TV, okay? You need to rest.

922
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:21,831
I'm gonna give you
something for the pain.

923
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,666
All right, and this should
put you out, okay?

924
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,936
And there we go.

925
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:34,208
Everything's looking good.
Monitors look good.

926
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,817
Thanks for being so nice to me.

927
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:45,325
You're welcome, it's our pleasure.
Now try and sleep.

928
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:47,536
Good night.
