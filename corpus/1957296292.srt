1
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,519
- Hey, ya!
- Ew!

2
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,289
Can we just turn it down
a little bit?

3
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,723
You know that if you're driving,

4
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,058
you can do what you want,
bitch.

5
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,737
Hey, oh!

6
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,806
I can't hear myself think.

7
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,408
Babe.

8
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,509
Sorry.

9
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,677
We don't need to listen
to your comedy routine

10
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,978
the whole way there, do we?

11
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,079
Takes a lot of practice
to be this funny.

12
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,215
Doesn't just happen overnight.

13
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,386
Well, I think you're very funny.

14
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,187
Funny-lookin'.

15
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,425
Oh, why don't you leave
the jokes to me, okay?

16
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,192
I don't know.

17
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,060
I think I might be a natural.

18
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,496
It's not like
this is a big deal or anything,

19
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,500
it's just like
the biggest manager in LA

20
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,702
is gonna be in my show.

21
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,408
I got your back even
if I have to listen

22
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:03,210
to your routine over,
and over, and over,

23
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,512
- and over, and--
- Eyes on the road, please.

24
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,013
- Oh.
- Yeah.

25
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,717
Thank you.

26
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,184
Oh, cool!

27
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,886
Look, there's a ghost town.

28
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,954
Come on, babe, let's stop.
It'll be so--

29
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,423
No, are you kidding?
No!

30
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,223
Oh, come on!

31
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,024
Look, I just wanna stretch
my legs,

32
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,461
maybe get something to eat,
and check my text.

33
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,029
Your boyfriend can wait
a few hours

34
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,431
before hearing from you, okay?

35
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,601
We gotta get to LA ASAP,
so I can rehearse.

36
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,370
You could rehearse tomorrow.

37
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,538
Kyle.

38
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,246
Okay, off we go.

39
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,325
What the hell happened?

40
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,931
Oh!

41
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,767
Fuck, it's like 300 bucks.

42
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,405
Do you have any service?

43
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,478
What the hell are we gonna do?

44
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,990
There's someone coming.

45
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,028
Oh, babe, come on,
you gotta do better than that.

46
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,664
I mean like strut your stuff,
show some booty.

47
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,865
Come on.
Stick this out.

48
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,767
There you go, yes!

49
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,034
See?

50
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,838
You hang out with me
long enough, you become fierce.

51
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,306
Nailin' it.

52
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,207
Wooh!

53
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,610
We are gonna be saved!

54
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,054
Well, that didn't work.

55
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,624
Maybe I need some more
sexist tips.

56
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,459
Any other bright ideas, Kyle?

57
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:05,999
The ghost town.

58
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,401
We can walk to that ghost town.

59
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,537
Surely, someone's gotta have
a phone, right?

60
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,571
How far is it?

61
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,139
Said it was like what?
3 miles off the highway.

62
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,574
We should be able to get there
before dark.

63
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,243
Great, we won't die after all.

64
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,554
It's not your fault.

65
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:27,688
Oh, I know.

66
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,889
Okay.

67
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,323
Come on, I'm jokin', I'm jokin'.

68
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
Come on, wait.

69
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,030
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

70
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,568
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

71
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,937
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

72
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,441
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

73
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:11,765
Ah!

74
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,534
Sign says, "It's open".

75
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,107
Locked.

76
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,579
Julia, what are you doin'?

77
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,480
Oh, come on.

78
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:27,648
We didn't come all this way
for nothin'.

79
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,082
Well, we also didn't come here
to be shot either.

80
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,553
- Julia!
- Come on, baby.

81
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,448
Looks abandoned to me.

82
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,952
Hello?

83
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,489
Hello.

84
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,459
Hello!

85
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,928
Ow, motherfucker.

86
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,197
Jesus Christ.

87
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,169
Hello?

88
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:30,143
Damn it.

89
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,312
I don't think
there's anyone here.

90
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,452
Alright, well,
we're not givin' up yet.

91
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,400
This place is fuckin' strange.

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,003
Hey, there's a caravan
we can stay in.

93
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,571
It's actually a camper van.

94
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,706
Oh!

95
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,374
Yeah, it's an American thing,
you wouldn't get it.

96
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:11,351
Oh, look, babe, you get yourself
a pair of shoes.

97
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,220
Oh, yeah?

98
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,655
Cute.

99
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,725
Or your beard trimmed.

100
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,360
Hmm.

101
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,929
Hello?

102
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,331
Need a room.

103
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:25,833
Desperately.

104
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:28,902
Julia.

105
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:29,937
What do you think
of the resemblance?

106
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,905
Oh, so handsome.

107
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,006
Treat.

108
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:37,244
It's like a much younger
version of you.

109
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,712
Hmm.

110
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,551
Maybe you're right, Kyle,
this place is kind of weird.

111
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,556
Giving me the creeps.

112
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,232
So cool.

113
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,250
Ooh! Oh, God!

114
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,452
What is it?

115
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,420
D-- d-- don't-- don't--
don't worry.

116
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:21,989
Just um,
just a friendly visitor.

117
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,556
- No worries.
- What the hell is it, Kyle?

118
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,092
There's a creature
of the slithering kind,

119
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,093
but don't worry, it's fine.

120
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,328
Okay, saddle your horses,
we're leavin'.

121
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,263
You know,
how I feel about snakes, Kyle.

122
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,932
Okay, alright,
so then where to now?

123
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,233
I don't care!
Anywhere, but here.

124
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,803
I will strip down to my bra
to get us a ride

125
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:36,970
if I have to, okay?

126
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,739
Julia!

127
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,607
Oh.

128
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,575
- Julia!
- Mm-mm.

129
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,643
Julia!

130
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,679
No, we need to get out
of this creepy ghost town

131
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,647
before the ghosts come out!

132
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,690
Alright.

133
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,794
Alright, what'd you wanna do?

134
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,334
I think
that's someone's house.

135
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,472
I don't wanna go in in there.

136
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,141
Spooky.

137
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,276
Well, it's gonna get dark soon.

138
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,378
So what other option
do we have?

139
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,826
Fine.

140
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,533
I like this color.

141
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,811
Hello?

142
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,245
Hi, our--
our car just broke down.

143
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,546
We just wanna know
if someone's got a phone

144
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,849
that we can use.

145
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,650
Hello?

146
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,514
What's that smell?

147
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,517
I don't know.

148
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,353
I think it's you, babe.

149
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,554
What's that that
you're wearing?

150
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,589
Oh.
Hmm, Dior.

151
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,293
Beers.

152
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,565
Babe, so old.

153
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,368
Yeah.

154
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,046
Hmm.

155
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:07,254
Kyle, just don't.

156
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,899
What is wrong with you?

157
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,935
Babe, come on.

158
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,903
There's no one here.

159
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,695
Julia, there's someone in here.

160
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,203
What do we do?

161
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,676
Sir?

162
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,721
Sir?

163
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,560
I think you're gonna have
to do better than that.

164
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,695
Oh, well, the job's yours
if you want it, honey.

165
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,667
Excuse me.

166
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,402
Sir.

167
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,870
- Are you okay?
- He's not waking up.

168
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,172
I think he's dead.
I think he's dead.

169
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,640
He's not dead,
I can see him breathing.

170
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,707
He's not breathing.

171
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,010
I can see him breathing.

172
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,480
Wake up!

173
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,519
What the hell are you doin'
in my room?

174
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,754
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

175
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,256
We weren't trespassing,
it's just we-- we-- we-- we--

176
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,391
found this place,
and then we somehow ended up

177
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:55,062
in your room, and um,
w-- w-- we thought that um--

178
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,096
Well, we thought--

179
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,430
He thought you were dead.

180
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,531
Dead?

181
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,200
What are you doin' yellin'
at a dead man?

182
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:04,404
Or maybe injured or something,
Julia.

183
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,707
No, no, I was just takin'
my afternoon nap.

184
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,345
We're so sorry
to have woken you.

185
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,516
Um, um, Mr...

186
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,187
Name's Ray.

187
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,224
Hi, Ray.

188
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:24,958
Hi.

189
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,526
I'm Julia.

190
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,394
Nice to meet you.

191
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,797
And this is Kyle.

192
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,467
We don't get much company out
this way.

193
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,270
Yeah, well, um, the place
looks abandoned so...

194
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,573
Well, we're in the middle
of renovatin' um,

195
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,708
my brother and I, that is.

196
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,609
- Oh.
- Oh, your brother?

197
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,576
- Yeah.
- Mmhmm.

198
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,578
Is he sleep somewhere around
here, too?

199
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:55,288
No, uh, he's went off to town
for supplies.

200
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,660
Alright, sorry, um,
do you have a phone?

201
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,096
No, we don't have a phone here.

202
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,798
Do you have a um, um,
a spare tire?

203
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:06,933
W-- w-- we could give you

204
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,968
- some money for it.
- Yeah.

205
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,671
I probably got a couple
around here that might fit.

206
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,905
Ah, okay!

207
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,806
Terrific, right.

208
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,342
So if we could just um--

209
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,909
Maybe you could give us a lift
actually down there

210
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,145
and then we can just
put the tire on,

211
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,312
we'll be out of your hair.

212
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,681
Yeah, that would be
a bit of a problem,

213
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,185
'cause my brother's gone
with the only running vehicle.

214
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,820
Uh, okay.

215
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,757
- Could stay the night here.
- Hmm.

216
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,426
Make you some supper.

217
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,362
Uh, thank you, Ray, really,
thank you.

218
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,630
It's just um, the reason
we're on this trip is actually

219
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:41,968
Julia's got a really important
show tomorrow in LA.

220
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,304
Show?
What kinda show?

221
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,939
Uh, stand-up.

222
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,476
I am standing up.

223
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,612
No, um, stand-up comedy.

224
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,013
I'm a comedian.

225
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,285
Got you.

226
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,720
I like a good joke out here
every now and then.

227
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,989
Helps pass the time.

228
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,127
When did you say the show was?

229
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,663
Um, tomorrow night.

230
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:15,568
Well, he'll be back by mornin'
and it's about four hours to LA

231
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:20,240
from here, so should be able
to get you there by noon.

232
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,510
Ah.

233
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,877
It's good.

234
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,349
Well, let's go get that supper.

235
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,084
- Hey.
- Great.

236
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,557
Well--

237
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,359
Here we are.

238
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,761
This stew is from an old
family recipe

239
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,897
passed down by my grandma.

240
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,266
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

241
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,533
You're welcome.

242
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,947
Hey, Ray, what's um,
what's that?

243
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:38,385
Well, here, have a closer look.

244
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,621
That's a replica of an actual
raptor's claw.

245
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,290
Oh, treat.

246
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,324
Oh, I love that.

247
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,594
This whole area was a large hub
for all that.

248
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,503
Can you imagine dinosaurs
roamed on this very property

249
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,338
millions of years ago?

250
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,241
Oh, wow!

251
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,677
Hmm, you have quite
the collection here.

252
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,180
The whole backroom is full
of this stuff.

253
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,816
Got thousands of artifacts
and fossils.

254
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,351
Wow, thousands?

255
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,485
Mmhmm.

256
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,990
Who's joseph Thompson?

257
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,493
That's my brother
and these are his things.

258
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:25,097
So are you and your brother
fixing up the ghost town

259
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,467
to show to the public someday
or--

260
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,868
That's the whole idea,

261
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,504
and you can come and work
the front desk when we're done.

262
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,382
Oh, that-- that's a good one.

263
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,684
There he goes again.

264
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,018
That was funny.

265
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,155
If the comedy thing
doesn't work out, that is.

266
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,656
This place is so creepy.

267
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,394
Like people locked up in one
of these buildings or something.

268
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,737
Need a hand with those, Ray?

269
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,340
No, I can manage just fine.

270
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,075
Sure wish I would have had
some time to show you around

271
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,310
here before it got dark.

272
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,179
Perhaps, we'll have some time
in the mornin'.

273
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,515
Oh, what time will your--

274
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,152
What the hell was that?

275
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,921
Just restless spirits,
don't mind them.

276
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,155
No, really, Ray, what was that?

277
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,024
D-- does someone live
out there?

278
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,795
It's none of my business
who lives where.

279
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,329
Outhouse right over there.

280
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,031
Ray, Ray.
No, that was a strange noise.

281
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,800
Have you heard stuff
like that before?

282
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,368
I live in a ghost town, son,

283
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,770
I hear all kinds of
damn strange noises out here

284
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,838
at night.

285
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,507
Come on, let's get you
to your lodgings.

286
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:25,011
We're gonna get murdered tonight
for sure.

287
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,254
Oh, that oughta scare
the ghost away.

288
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,541
Well, I'll leave you to it.

289
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,876
Thank you so much, Ray.

290
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,277
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

291
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,344
- Thank you.
- Sweet, thank you.

292
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:33,780
You're so sweet, thank you.

293
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,349
Oh, babe.

294
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,819
Surely, there's a comedy bit
in all of this for you.

295
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,622
Oh, you think so?

296
00:24:15,722 --> 00:24:17,056
Show me somethin'.

297
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:17,924
Absolutely not.

298
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,291
No, no, no, come on.

299
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,426
Get up and show me something.

300
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,929
A little evening's
entertainment.

301
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,296
Maybe I can learn something
from you.

302
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,598
- Oh, babe.
- Yeah.

303
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:26,733
Fine.

304
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,301
Hmm.

305
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,103
Hmm.

306
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:36,943
Is this thing on?

307
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,244
Yeah.

308
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,179
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Laugh Factory.

309
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,448
Tonight, we're gonna speak
about caravans.

310
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:46,352
The uh, funny thing about
stayin' in a caravan is...

311
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:55,094
They-- mm...

312
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,463
They um, what?

313
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,498
Alright, security, security,
we got a heckler.

314
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:00,800
Get her out.

315
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,834
They--

316
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,176
Okay.

317
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,310
Fine, I don't know.

318
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,812
Fine.
I don't know.

319
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:13,780
No idea.

320
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,982
Not as easy as it looks, huh?

321
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:16,883
Alright, you put me on the spot.

322
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,618
- You try it.
- Oh, no.

323
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:19,786
No, no, no, no, no.

324
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:20,987
I have tons of stuff,

325
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,355
but you're just gonna have
to get me out of here alive

326
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,157
and then I can show you
at my next gig.

327
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,499
Seriously though,
don't you think this Ray guy

328
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,834
is strange?

329
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,569
Maybe a little odd.
Why?

330
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:41,173
I just feel like
he's hiding something.

331
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,143
Uh, he's probably just not been
around many people.

332
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,377
I mean look at this place.

333
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,581
Did you see the pill bottles
next to his bed?

334
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,653
What if he's a psychopath

335
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:57,690
and tries to kill us
in our sleep.

336
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:59,191
Oh, bitch, please!

337
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,267
Why would he wait
until we're asleep?

338
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,836
So we're less of a fight.

339
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,571
Okay, you need to stop
right now,

340
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,572
'cause you're gonna freak
yourself out

341
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:14,874
and we all know how you get,
so...

342
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,776
Okay.

343
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:17,844
Don't say I didn't warn you.

344
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:19,078
Oh, wait.

345
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,680
- Where are you goin'?
- I have to pee.

346
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,749
Alright, well,
I'll-- I'll come with you.

347
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,250
Why?

348
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,584
For protection.

349
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,020
I'm a man.

350
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,890
Right, for protection.

351
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:31,924
I'm so sorry.

352
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,592
- Um, ladies first.
- Let's go.

353
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,314
Come on, Mr. Bojangles,
come on.

354
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,419
Hey, there you go.

355
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,320
Come on.

356
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,889
Good boy, look.

357
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,674
How long does it take you
to pee?

358
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,343
Not much longer.

359
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,113
I'll just meet you back
at the caravan.

360
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,615
No, no, Julia, don't you dare!

361
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:04,884
Don't you dare.

362
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,689
I'll kill you.

363
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,862
So where are you?

364
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,463
You're dead!

365
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:21,968
Come on, let's go.

366
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,302
Damn it.

367
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,504
Insane.

368
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,572
I'll get you.

369
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,207
Come here.

370
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,642
You son of a bastard,
son of a...

371
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,345
I told you he was off.

372
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,383
This way.

373
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,486
Come on.

374
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,657
Mr. Bojangles, where are you?

375
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,527
Come on.

376
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:13,085
No, no, no, no, no, no.

377
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:14,720
I don't want,
"Here lies the hacked up body

378
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,088
of Julia Clark
who could have lived a long

379
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,890
and prosperous life
if only her friend Kyle,

380
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,225
who's buried next to her,
hadn't said,

381
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,259
'It'd be rude to leave, babe.'"

382
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:22,895
written on my gravestone!

383
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,196
Okay.

384
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:27,466
You're stressed and I get that,
but like I really think

385
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,935
there must be some
sort of explanation.

386
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,569
Well, I'm not sticking around
to find out.

387
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,770
I can't take your shit.

388
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,039
Well, I thought
he was quite nice, okay?

389
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:33,940
I can't imagine him
doin' anything that--

390
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:35,574
Hey!

391
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,209
Hey!
You guys!

392
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,444
Hey!

393
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,579
You guys, open up!

394
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,747
No, open up!

395
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:42,815
I'm tryin'
to tell you somethin'!

396
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,716
Back the fuck off,
I'm warning you!

397
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,318
Oh no, listen to me!

398
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,253
Hear me out!

399
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:49,788
Listen!

400
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,058
There's something
in the goddamn barn out there.

401
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:00,266
What?

402
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,440
I can't believe that
just happened.

403
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:09,575
What do we do now?

404
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,343
Let's go back to the house
and find a phone.

405
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,845
Come on.

406
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,581
What was that?

407
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,283
Who cares?
Let's go, we gotta go!

408
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:20,686
Did you hear that?

409
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,192
Holy shit, I think
there's someone in there.

410
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,026
We gotta go, come on!

411
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:27,493
I think there's someone
in there.

412
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,527
No, no, no.

413
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:31,197
Kyle.

414
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,331
Wait, wait, wait!

415
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,371
Hello?

416
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,329
Run!
Go, go, go!

417
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:12,638
What the fuck was that?

418
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,040
I don't-- I don't know.

419
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,874
Was that like a coyote
or something?

420
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,844
No, I think a lot more bigger
than that, than me.

421
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,046
I feel like I'm in some
sort of nightmare.

422
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,680
Okay, well,
get your shit together.

423
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,349
We gotta find a phone
or something.

424
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,196
Julia.

425
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,330
Yeah?

426
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,552
Fake.

427
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:03,122
Isn't anything fucking real
in this place?

428
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,628
Julia, there's not gonna be
a phone in the kitchen, alright?

429
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,762
Gotta try.

430
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:20,606
You've gotta be kidding me.

431
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,473
What?

432
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,412
He's a fucking liar.

433
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,779
His brother's not coming!

434
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,781
He never was.

435
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:32,651
For all we know, he killed him
and fed him to that thing

436
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,988
he's got locked up out there.

437
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,456
What in the hell is going on?

438
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,292
W-- we uh,
we don't want any trouble.

439
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,927
Where are you going?

440
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,795
We're just about to leave.

441
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:44,896
You can't.

442
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,265
It's not safe out there.

443
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,499
I got something trapped
in the shed

444
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,568
and I don't know how long
it's gonna hold.

445
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,003
What the hell is that thing?

446
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,438
I don't know.

447
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:54,240
I've never seen anything
like it.

448
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,008
Why don't we just hunker
down here

449
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,409
and wait till morning?

450
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,678
- My brother will be here--
- Oh, bullshit!

451
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,115
You lied to us,
you crazy old man.

452
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,183
What do you mean?

453
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:07,586
Your brother's not coming
for us tomorrow.

454
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,521
Or ever.

455
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:13,759
Why would you do that?

456
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:19,865
Because I wanted the company.

457
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,301
You don't know what it's like
bein' out here alone.

458
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,105
Ever since Joe died.

459
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,718
No more lies, Ray.

460
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,788
We gotta know
what's happening here.

461
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,523
And what's that thing
in the shed?

462
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:46,625
I told you I don't know.

463
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,531
Sorry about--

464
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,301
You know, I-- I did think
you were tryin' to kill us.

465
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,376
What is it?

466
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,877
I thought I saw something.

467
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,179
What was it?

468
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:08,714
I d-- I don't know.

469
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,989
Did you hear that?

470
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,591
Hell, it got out.

471
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,699
Mr. Bojangles, you're alive!

472
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,402
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

473
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:34,172
Ray, how long did you say that
the door would hold for again?

474
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,541
That wood plank
should hold it a while.

475
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,842
Why?

476
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,945
When I was at the shed,
when I fell backwards,

477
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,447
I think I knocked the wood
out of place.

478
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:48,786
But the door should hold it
for a little bit longer, right?

479
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,755
Wouldn't bet my life on it.

480
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:58,029
Mr. Bojangles.

481
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,798
Mr. Bojangles, come here.

482
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,799
Mr. Bojangles.

483
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,033
Come here.

484
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,243
Come on, get over here,
come on.

485
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,717
- Mr. Bojangles.
- Come here.

486
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:19,651
Come on, come on, come on.

487
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,489
Come on.

488
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,890
Come on, boy.

489
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:34,900
I'm gonna get my dog, damn it.

490
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,134
Ray?

491
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,803
Come here, boy, come on.

492
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,239
Come on, hurry up.

493
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,173
Come on.

494
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,512
Come on.

495
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,280
That's it, come on, come on.

496
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,493
Yeah, do it again.
Do it again.

497
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,962
Come on, Mr. Bojangles.
Come on, boy.

498
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,764
- Come.
- Come on.

499
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,765
Come on.

500
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,801
Come on, boy.

501
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,937
Come on.

502
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:13,539
Come on.
Here we go.

503
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,178
No!

504
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,983
No way!
No!

505
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,452
Oh.

506
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,288
- Ray.
- Mr. Bojangles.

507
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,122
This can't be real, this
can't be fuckin' real, okay?

508
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,991
I'm gonna wake up soon.

509
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,064
Get those out.

510
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,399
Get those out.

511
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,075
It knows we're in here.

512
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,879
But if we don't draw
any more attention to ourselves,

513
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,481
it might lose interest.

514
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,088
Shut those out.

515
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,195
Turn that lamp off.

516
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:15,401
Get down!

517
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:16,335
Down!

518
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,105
Down.

519
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,446
- Over here, come here.
- Julia.

520
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,558
We can't stay here,
it's gonna get in.

521
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,895
Listen, I can try to get
to the truck.

522
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,365
The batteries about shot in it,

523
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:49,301
but if I can get to the shed
and get the battery charger,

524
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,970
I might be able
to get it started, okay?

525
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,912
Here we are,
there's the saloon...

526
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:03,815
there's the shed.

527
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,588
You two get over the saloon
and go through it.

528
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:13,725
I'm gonna go out back,
get to the shed,

529
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:16,094
and then I'm gonna come around
this way,

530
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,263
and meet you over at the truck
by the saloon.

531
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,130
Okay.

532
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,098
Okay.

533
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,567
Here.

534
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,438
You're gonna need this.

535
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,475
Okay?

536
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,803
Here, you might need this.

537
00:38:57,869 --> 00:38:59,104
Thank you.

538
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,606
Okay, go.

539
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,239
It's right there.

540
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:36,902
Are you okay?

541
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,269
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

542
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:39,605
Did the light flash
in your eyes?

543
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:40,739
Listen, I'm fine, okay?

544
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:42,240
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

545
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,251
What's it doing?

546
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,489
Julia, Julia, Julia.

547
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:58,456
Ju--

548
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,661
Julia.

549
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,995
Julia.

550
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:14,973
It's just a statue.

551
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,075
It's a frickin' statue.

552
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,583
Just a frickin' donkey.

553
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:42,267
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

554
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,371
Come on.

555
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,219
Do you see anything?

556
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,021
No, nothin'.

557
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,465
I see Ray!

558
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,656
Oh shit, it's gonna get him.

559
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,258
- Ray!
- Ray!

560
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,426
Ray, watch out!

561
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,061
Ray!

562
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:48,166
- Ray!
- Ray!

563
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,034
Ray, watch out!

564
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:09,454
Ray!

565
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,389
Julia.

566
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:12,791
Julia!

567
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,960
Don't worry, stay here.

568
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:18,596
Julia!

569
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:29,307
Hey!

570
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,811
Hey, over here!

571
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:10,508
Come on, come on, come on!

572
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,743
Come on!

573
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,381
Yes!
Yes, I did it!

574
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:17,582
Yes!

575
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,501
Oh.

576
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,503
What's the matter, son?

577
00:45:38,603 --> 00:45:39,570
You o--

578
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,705
What's wrong?

579
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:51,116
- You okay?
- What's wrong?

580
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,899
Yeah, okay.

581
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:41,933
Just take it easy.

582
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,568
- Where's Julia?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

583
00:46:43,668 --> 00:46:44,402
no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

584
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:45,003
No, no,
we need to find Julia.

585
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:45,803
Come on, we will.

586
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,274
Just take it easy, okay?

587
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:50,575
- I'm fine, Ray.
- You sure?

588
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,643
- Hmm.
- You okay to sit up?

589
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,679
Yeah.

590
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,147
Okay.

591
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,949
Now you listen to me.

592
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:01,019
You stay right here,
and take it easy, and rest up.

593
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,488
I'll go get her.

594
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,190
You should be ready to get
the hell out of here

595
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,192
when we get back, okay?

596
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,015
Come on!

597
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,451
Ray!

598
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,033
Ray!

599
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,046
Ray.

600
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,013
Ray.

601
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:17,382
Ray.

602
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,491
What the hell is happening?

603
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:27,825
Fuck.

604
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,060
Ray.

605
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:42,807
Kyle.

606
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,378
Kyle, are you in here?

607
00:50:58,756 --> 00:50:59,824
Where is it?

608
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,192
It's in the backroom.

609
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,232
Ray didn't make it.

610
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,699
I know.

611
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,168
Uh, the car.

612
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,737
Uh, it's dead.

613
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:14,939
No!

614
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:22,247
Where do we go?

615
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,881
Far away from here.

616
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,956
Right, if we're gonna get
out of here alive,

617
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,793
we have to either kill
the fuckin' thing or trap it,

618
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,060
so...

619
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,632
Okay.

620
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,499
Okay, here's the plan.

621
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,938
One of us, get on the roof
and will distract it.

622
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:56,040
While the other's--

623
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,309
I think if we can in lure it,
we can close the door,

624
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:00,678
and lock it in that cage section
at the back.

625
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:03,281
Do you understand?
Okay?

626
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:09,954
Holy shit!

627
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:11,055
- Come here, come on.
- Whoa, okay.

628
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,223
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

629
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,525
I'll go on the roof,
you go get the horse food, okay?

630
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:15,493
- Okay.
- You with me?

631
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:16,461
- Yeah.
- Okay.

632
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,862
1.

633
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,163
- 2.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

634
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,298
- What?
- I have a question, okay?

635
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:21,366
- I have a question.
- What, what?

636
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,200
Okay, so--
so there's a horse truck, yeah?

637
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:24,702
For horses.
It's for horses,

638
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:25,803
not for this fuckin' pig!

639
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,137
You have a better idea?

640
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:29,407
- No! No!
- I love you.

641
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:30,408
You can do this.

642
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,041
- Ready?
- Yeah.

643
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,042
1.

644
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,077
2.

645
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:33,878
Let's go!

646
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,179
Go, go!

647
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,250
Run!

648
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,024
Kyle!

649
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,343
Hey!

650
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:37,141
Over here, you old fuck!

651
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,316
Kyle!

652
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:46,584
Julia.

653
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:47,652
Go.

654
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,620
No.

655
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,889
Now!

656
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:43,508
No, you die,
you piece of shit!

657
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:46,276
Come and get me!

658
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:09,126
* I rode into town

659
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:12,096
* About an hour ago

660
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,232
* I had to check my pressure

661
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:18,268
* My tank was running old

662
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:21,472
* Next thing I see

663
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:25,409
* Women in low-cut jeans

664
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,411
* Uh, that's a sweet little
honey sayin' *

665
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:31,381
* I sure like your truck

666
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,118
* I take off my hat

667
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:35,720
* And I smile...

668
00:57:38,756 --> 00:57:41,325
$20 gas.

669
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,493
Are you alright?

670
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:44,495
I'm fine, give me my change.

671
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,002
You're welcome.

672
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:55,973
Asshole.

673
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,735
Oh my God!

674
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:37,041
I thought you were dead.

675
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,208
I told you,
I wouldn't miss your show

676
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:40,177
for the world, hey?

677
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:52,056
So like--

678
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,257
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

679
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:57,895
Like-- like how the fuck
are you alive right now?

680
00:59:58,028 --> 00:59:59,529
I hid in the closet.

681
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,367
You were in the closet.

682
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,435
I've been in the closet
for 17 years.

683
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,240
You were in the closet.

684
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,877
Wow.

685
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,279
Shared trauma, baby.

686
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:16,914
We got shared trauma now.

687
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,548
What?
Yeah.

688
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,819
I mean what the fuck
just happened?

689
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,754
Oh.

690
01:00:23,888 --> 01:00:26,556
We forgot our backpacks.

691
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,792
Oh.

692
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,626
That's fine.

693
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,929
I don't need a backpack.

694
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,231
Oh, 3 miles back to the car.

695
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,800
I'm gonna call my mom now.

696
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,501
Yeah.

697
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,903
Phew.

698
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,104
I'm hungry.

699
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:41,906
- I'm hungry, too.
- Yeah.

700
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,141
- Let's go to Danny's.
- Danny's.

701
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,309
Oh, pancake.

702
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:46,777
Oh, waffles.

703
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:48,779
Oh, treat!

704
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,923
Okay, uh, this next comedian
coming to the stage,

705
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:00,424
she's hilarious.

706
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:03,761
Originally from Las Vegas,
now livin' here in Los Angeles,

707
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:07,865
please put your hands together
for the very funny Julia Clarke.

708
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:15,139
Hi guys.

709
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,140
My name is Julia.

710
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:17,975
Nice to meet you.

711
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,343
Uh, how's everyone doing?

712
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:20,978
- Are you doing good?
- Yeah.

713
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:23,347
Right, good?

714
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,381
Honestly, however you're doing,

715
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,650
you're probably doing better
than me.

716
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:27,818
I'm doing pretty bad.

717
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:31,388
I'm-- honestly,
let's be real for a second.

718
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,192
I'm still dealing
with the emotional trauma

719
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:39,730
from being attacked by a raptor.

720
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:42,900
A prehistoric dinosaur.

721
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,169
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

722
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,337
Yeah.

723
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,840
Actually,
I was almost literally dead,

724
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:52,409
but my fabulously handsome

725
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:56,380
and terrible at driving
best friend Kyle saved my life.

726
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,014
- Aw.
- Give him-- aw!

727
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:57,882
Ooh.

728
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:01,018
Yeah, it's me, bitches!

729
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:02,686
Ooh!

730
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,022
He's actually newly single,
by the way.

731
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:08,325
Uh, but ladies don't bother,

732
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,560
he just recently came
out of the closet, so...

733
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:11,561
Aw.

734
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:13,998
Where he was hiding
from the raptor!

735
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:15,933
Remember I was talking about
the raptor?

736
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,234
Yeah, I wasn't kidding
about that.

737
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,869
I wasn't kidding.

738
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:20,270
But also just some--

739
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,072
some genuine advice
for you guys.

740
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,075
If you ever find yourself
running from a raptor,

741
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,544
I suggest wearing comfy shoes,

742
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,847
because they are really
fucking fast.

743
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:33,250
And they're really smart, too.

744
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:35,085
While me and Kyle
were running you know,

745
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,554
Kyle's like,
"Oh, do you think he saw us?"

746
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:42,692
And I was like, "Yeah, Kyle,
he saw us,

747
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,762
and he's probably doing
our fucking taxes, too."

748
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:48,098
"He's really smart."

749
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:49,900
He's like, "Oh, Julia, I just-

750
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:53,637
I saw you spent $200
at IKEA in July.

751
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,806
We could probably claim that
back on work expenses."

752
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,707
"Oh my God, raptor, really?"

753
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,110
"That's like so cool.

754
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,145
Thank you so much."

755
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,246
"Yeah, of course, Julia.

756
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:03,713
Also, one more thing."

757
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:04,548
"Yeah, raptor?"

758
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:09,719
And then he eats me,
'cause he's a fucking dinosaur.

759
01:03:53,964 --> 01:03:56,033
Babe, what's goin' on?

760
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,835
What's goin' on?
You okay?

761
01:03:58,969 --> 01:03:59,636
Yeah.

762
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,371
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

763
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:02,439
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

764
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:03,273
Hey, don't be silly.

765
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,541
Come here.

766
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:07,811
So that nightmare again?

767
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:08,845
Yeah.

768
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:10,447
Hmm.

769
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,150
Not the one that I get eaten,
is it?

770
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:16,286
Maybe.

771
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:19,723
Hmm, right.

772
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,857
Sorry.

773
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,492
Okay.

774
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:23,961
Look, I get it, okay,
I really do,

775
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,862
but they found it, right?

776
01:04:25,996 --> 01:04:27,697
There's nothing to worry
about anymore, okay?

777
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:31,535
I know, but I just keep
thinking like w--

778
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:34,704
what if he made more, you know?

779
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,308
Babe, that's ridiculous.

780
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,743
- There's no way he made more.
- Is it?

781
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,046
He could have totally made more.

782
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,580
It's crazy that he made one.

783
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,215
There's no way, I promise you.

784
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,850
- You promise?
- Promise.

785
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,020
Don't worry.

786
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,072
They have earthquakes in LA,
right?

787
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:09,606
- Right, totally.
- You're fine.

788
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,041
Yeah.

789
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:12,009
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

790
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,711
See?

791
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:48,712
Nothin'.

792
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,439
Ready?
And action!

793
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:50,774
Now, you listen to me.

794
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:54,044
You stay right here
and rest up.

795
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,779
I'll go get her, okay?

796
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:56,846
Okay.

797
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,283
Just be ready to go
when we get back.

798
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,821
Oh, no, no!

799
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,829
Oh, God, no!

800
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,399
What?

801
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:16,700
Come on.

802
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:17,867
What are you guys laughin' for?

803
01:07:18,001 --> 01:07:19,069
You're supposed to say "cut".

804
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:26,176
You guys are gonna kill
my vocal chords.
