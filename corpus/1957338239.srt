1
00:00:02,688 --> 00:00:07,688
Swore I would never go back

2
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:13,176
didn't know what I had

3
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:27,452
that feels like home

4
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:55,756
own but I wound up lost

5
00:00:56,105 --> 00:01:01,105
to the foot of the cross

6
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:15,468
that feels like home.

7
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,306
Thank you, Lexi, for
sharing your beautiful voice

8
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,896
with us here.

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,296
A couple of announcements first.

10
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,776
A very special
announcement today.

11
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,646
One of our young people has
decided to serve our country.

12
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,599
Brandon, would you stand please?

13
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:17,047
Big on doubles.

14
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,906
Mr. Coleman just gave
me a hundred bucks.

15
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,946
No way, does he think
you're going on vacation?

16
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,970
- Yeah.
- Nice.

17
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:26,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,426
Super proud of you.

19
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,260
- Thank you, sir.
- Super.

20
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,516
And be safe, we're gonna
be praying for you.

21
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,376
And we'll be anxious

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,209
for you to get back.

23
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,233
Thank you.

24
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:42,123
"And if you're ever
feeling scared,"

25
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:44,007
"I will be right
there by your side."

26
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,341
Dad.

27
00:02:46,365 --> 00:02:47,326
Yeah, honey.

28
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,350
What's an IAD?

29
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,476
IAD?

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,973
A boy in my class said his
uncle was killed by an IAD.

31
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,070
Oh.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
You mean IED.

33
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,380
It's a homemade explosive
used by the bad guys.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,580
Will they use one on you?

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,103
Your dad is gonna
be really safe.

36
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,716
And I'm gonna have a
lot of people around me

37
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,423
helping keep everyone safe.

38
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,846
It's really important
that you know that.

39
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,276
I'm going because
I want to serve.

40
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,873
I want to serve my country.

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,113
You know, it's only
hitting me just now.

42
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,816
I knew this moment would
come, but I just can't.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,653
Hey, hey.

44
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,093
I'm gonna come back.

45
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,496
I really believe that this is
what God has called me to do.

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,816
And I can't explain how,

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,490
but I know he's
gonna protect me.

48
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,243
Oh ten-hut, hut, hut, hut.

49
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,199
Where's my bunk?

50
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,573
I have no idea.

51
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,340
- What's up, dawg?
- What's up?

52
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:36,869
Ten-hut.

53
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,286
What is this?

54
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,846
Take that horse crap off.

55
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,870
Suck it up.

56
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,916
What?

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,306
What is this?

58
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,830
Are you opening a candy
store, what are you doing?

59
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,876
What is this?

60
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,226
It's what I have,
Drill Sergeant.

61
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,556
What, are you laughing at me?

62
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,390
No, Drill Sergeant.

63
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,522
Do you find
something funny, son?

64
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,596
No, Drill Sergeant.

65
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,276
You know what I find funny?

66
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,986
You brought a tub.

67
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,416
You are Tubby.

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,643
That's it, Tubby.

69
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,686
And you, were you in
a motorcycle gang?

70
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,476
- No, Drill Sergeant.
- You're pretty boy.

71
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,433
You're pretty boy.

72
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:18,606
Get that off your head.

73
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,268
What is this, huh?

74
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,459
Whose is this?

75
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:25,323
- Who?
- Mine, Drill Sergeant.

76
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,270
What is this?

77
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,463
The Bible, Drill Sergeant.

78
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,274
Preacher, that's you.

79
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,108
Yes, Drill Sergeant.

80
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,283
I'm on to you, boy.

81
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,573
I got you later, boy.

82
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,757
Sergeant, take care of this.

83
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:42,881
Yes, Drill Sergeant.

84
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,503
What a mess, what a mess.

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,910
What are we gonna do with this?

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,526
You believe in this?

87
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,746
Yes, Drill Sergeant.

88
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,403
Turn to Jeremiah 5:20.

89
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,123
Read it.

90
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:08,116
"You are my war club,
my weapon for battle."

91
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,950
Louder.

92
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:11,276
"You are my war club,
my weapon for battle."

93
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,110
Louder.

94
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:14,413
"You on my war club,
my weapon for battle.

95
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,063
"With you, I shatter nations."

96
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:18,027
"With you, I destroy kingdoms."

97
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,860
Kingdoms, gentlemen.

98
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,786
We're gonna destroy
kingdoms, right?

99
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,296
Sir, yes, Sir.

100
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Put that in your
locker, Preacher.

101
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,626
Do you believe in God?

102
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,555
God?

103
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,969
Yeah, man.

104
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,326
Yeah, I guess.

105
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,396
Hey, preacher, why don't
you read us a story,

106
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,700
help pass the time, huh?

107
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,383
This one's from
Philippians 4:13.

108
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,507
"I can do all things in
Christ, who gives me strength."

109
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,006
You're gonna need
some of that strength

110
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,306
to get old Tubby over
that wall outside.

111
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,676
Yeah, yeah, all
right, very funny.

112
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,328
Come on, let's go.

113
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,843
Go, get up, get up, again.

114
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,094
Get down.

115
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,270
Down.

116
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:22,961
Up, down.

117
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:23,795
Up.

118
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,151
Tubby, down, up.

119
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,586
Stay, I said stay up.

120
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,396
Get up, down.

121
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,230
Up, down.

122
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:32,998
Up, get it moving.

123
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,282
Come on, Tubby, you got it.

124
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:36,546
Get down, get down, go, let's
go, next room, next room,

125
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,272
Tubby, move, next room.

126
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,527
What is your goal?

127
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,246
Might as well pass this.

128
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,270
Hey.

129
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,425
I got you.

130
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,810
And for the man.

131
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:59,471
Oh and it's still hot.

132
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:00,304
You're like his best friend.

133
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:01,138
I'm listening guys.

134
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:02,868
Hey listen, I like Tootsie Roll.

135
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:04,946
Homemade chocolate.

136
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,797
Watch this.

137
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:06,631
With a Tootsie Roll?

138
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,463
With a Tootsie Roll, yes.

139
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,971
He does this all the
time, believe me.

140
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:12,286
You hear something,

141
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,883
take it out of the paper.

142
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,015
Swirl it.

143
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,769
I have never seen this
before my entire life.

144
00:08:20,793 --> 00:08:22,195
You can be at that for hours

145
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:23,539
if you want that
to be chocolate.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,066
I'm just so exhausted here.

147
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,606
I really miss you.

148
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,440
Make sure the kids know

149
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:34,018
I miss being at their
soccer games, okay.

150
00:08:34,042 --> 00:08:35,007
Hey Daddy.

151
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,196
Hey sweetie, happy birthday.

152
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,366
How was the party?

153
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,496
It was good.

154
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,506
We took a lot of pictures
for mama to send you.

155
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,856
Oh that's great.

156
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,026
I really wish I could
have been there.

157
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,481
I got this new doll,
her name is Lily.

158
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:53,446
Then I also got this bike
helmet, the bikes outside,

159
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,934
but I can show you that later.

160
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,366
And I got this book
"A Little Princess."

161
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,086
I've been reading it to myself

162
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,576
and I'm on chapter three
and it's a great book.

163
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,406
And I love it.

164
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,966
Why don't you let me talk to
daddy for a little bit, okay.

165
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,876
Okay.

166
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,797
Bye Daddy, love you.

167
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:08,993
Yeah, I love you.

168
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,196
Hi Honey.

169
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,396
Oh, you look tired.

170
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,926
Yeah I am.

171
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,536
Last night we went
on a 3:00 a.m. run

172
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,233
then we went back to bed.

173
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:21,406
Yeah.

174
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,526
Listen, I have a
pretty good idea

175
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,700
of where they're sending
me when we finish.

176
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,040
I'll be rolling into
deployment like we thought.

177
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,526
I don't know what
communication's gonna be like

178
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,163
at that point, I'll
try to stay in touch.

179
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,586
I want you to know
how proud I am of you

180
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,076
and how proud your
father would be too.

181
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Thanks.

182
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,696
So tell me more about
life back there.

183
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,530
Anything new with.

184
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,696
Hurry up Preacher.

185
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,176
Hey, I just sat down.

186
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,576
Preacher.

187
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,365
Yeah, Drill Sergeant's
nickname for me.

188
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,526
It's kind of caught
on with the guys too.

189
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,116
I don't know if it's the fear
of war or the lack of sleep,

190
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,076
most everyone here wants
to know more about God.

191
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,386
Well, do you think I
could send some bibles?

192
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,206
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

193
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,063
I'd rather have the computer.

194
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,176
Ah, listen honey, I
better go, I love you.

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
I love you too.

196
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,546
Hey Preacher, I couldn't
help overhearing,

197
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,836
you told your wife you're
getting sent to the war.

198
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,731
That's the rumor, isn't it?

199
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:30,476
Well, yeah, but that's
just, it, it's a rumor,

200
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,950
there's nothing official yet.

201
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,916
Look, if it turns
out to be wrong,

202
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,366
I'll gladly call her back
and tell her the good news.

203
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,396
But until then, I don't
want to give her false hope.

204
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,976
Sometimes it helps to
prepare for the worst.

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,296
Sounds pretty cynical
for the bible guy.

206
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,126
Yeah, well, God doesn't
promise to do everything

207
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,836
the way we'd want him to.

208
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,886
All right, well then
what does he promise.

209
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,786
My wife's praying
for me to stay safe.

210
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,760
You think she should
just give that up?

211
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,613
Oh leave it alone, Tubby.

212
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,576
If you wanted a guarantee
of staying safe,

213
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
you really chose the
wrong line of work.

214
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,907
Fair enough, Captain.

215
00:11:21,038 --> 00:11:22,038
Chris.

216
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:25,562
Chris.

217
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,387
What's up?

218
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,042
What's up man?

219
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:30,317
Chilling, chilling.

220
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,956
How you doing?

221
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,206
Hey.

222
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,230
Yeah.

223
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,303
You know they sending
us tomorrow right?

224
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:42,446
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,318
You okay?

226
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:44,277
I'm good, I'm good.

227
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:45,301
I'm just.

228
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,376
You know I love you right?

229
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,341
Yeah.

230
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:53,983
What you talking about?

231
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,008
Just wanted to tell you,

232
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:55,842
tell you I love you.

233
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:57,877
I love you too man.

234
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:58,711
You okay?

235
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,484
I'm okay, I'm good.

236
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:32,997
And Al-Qaeda
terrorists trained men.

237
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,668
In Afghanistan.

238
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:18,993
You know, I feel
like I'm going crazy.

239
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,500
It's been two years and I
still, in the morning, rollover

240
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,340
and I go to say something
to him and he's not there.

241
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,646
Have you heard any more news?

242
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,096
Any more news?

243
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,226
I've heard no news.

244
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,226
It's, "Call this number."

245
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,603
Where's my husband?

246
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:45,246
"Call this number."

247
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,783
Can I get a hold of my husband?

248
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,476
"Call this number?"

249
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,303
Is he alive?

250
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:51,747
"Call this number."

251
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,194
I get it.

252
00:13:57,218 --> 00:14:00,363
I get it, it's war, but
I need to know something.

253
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,520
We're still praying for him.

254
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,306
Door rear to your left, one up.

255
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,707
Clear left, up one.

256
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,089
Bravo you hot?

257
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,306
Bravo, Stronghold,
head down the floor,

258
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,307
tell me when you're ready.

259
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:39,416
Bravo ready.

260
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,469
Alpha move.

261
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:41,493
Moving up.

262
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:51,866
Alpha set.

263
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,890
Bravo move.

264
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:02,573
Alpha, other side, move.

265
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:13,317
Get your butt up here.

266
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,013
Chris, where are you?

267
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,609
Chris?

268
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,710
Push forward.

269
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:07,345
Oh.

270
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:08,369
Oh please God, please.

271
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:14,685
Hello.

272
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,803
Daddy.

273
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,029
Clear.

274
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,053
Security check.

275
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,213
Tubby, check the body.

276
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:54,986
Clear.

277
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,886
One of our members
has returned to us.

278
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,910
And we are so grateful and
thankful to him for his service.

279
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,986
With thank him, we
thank his family.

280
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,586
He served our country
over two years

281
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,506
in Afghanistan and Iraq.

282
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,686
And we're so happy
to have him back.

283
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,274
Please stand Sergeant
Brandon Williams.

284
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,393
How you doing, sir.

285
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:48,076
Here you go, I'm so sorry.

286
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,310
Thank you.

287
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,206
Every third, Wednesday
of the month,

288
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,526
I gotta come up here to the VA

289
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,093
and talk to an expert
about my feelings.

290
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,883
All I really want is for
someone to listen to me.

291
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,070
That's not what happens.

292
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,763
Instead you go in there,
you pour your heart out.

293
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,846
And what they do is they
type on their computer,

294
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,693
print out some prescription
and they send you off.

295
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:27,857
They don't care.

296
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,213
They're not even listening.

297
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,089
This way, that way.

298
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:42,695
This way.

299
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,229
There you go.

300
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
Hey.

301
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,656
Can I get a round for the guys.

302
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Sure thing.

303
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,220
Did Dallas win?

304
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:15,494
I don't know.

305
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,186
Look at it there.

306
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,423
I had him two to one.

307
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
New member?

308
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,130
I don't know.

309
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:28,986
I just thought, I
served in Afghanistan.

310
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,010
Oh I can tell.

311
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,366
Fourth Infantry Division.

312
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,393
Air Force retired.

313
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,443
You guys just finished
a parade or something?

314
00:22:48,297 --> 00:22:50,726
You wanna join us?

315
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,847
I just kind of want
to be, you know?

316
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,310
Well.

317
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,990
Brandon, Brandon Williams.

318
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,906
Well, Brandon Williams,
stop by anytime.

319
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,930
Thank you.

320
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,068
Everybody get down.

321
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,690
Brandon, Brandon, it's okay.

322
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,756
Gary, get over here, Gary.

323
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,776
Tom, stop, what happened?

324
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,016
I been following him for miles,

325
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,486
he swerving all over the road.

326
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,646
Okay, I'm sorry, he's sorry,

327
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,537
he doesn't know what he's doing.

328
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:44,726
He's all messed up right now.

329
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,876
A warning, couldn't you
please just give me a chance

330
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,710
to talk to him?

331
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,883
He's going through so
much Tom, you know that.

332
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,083
I'll tell you what, if he's
serious about getting help,

333
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,204
have him give me a call.

334
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,756
Thank you.

335
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,776
Because he's gonna kill somebody

336
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,600
unless we get this
straightened out.

337
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,023
Hey, maybe after the game
we can go for a walk?

338
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah, a walk is good.

339
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,396
Amber, sweetie, did
you tell your daddy

340
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,776
about camp this summer?

341
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,316
Camp?

342
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,906
Yeah.

343
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,886
Church camp, she
finally reached the age.

344
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,996
Is it overnight?

345
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,977
Well yeah.

346
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:43,986
Absolutely not.

347
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,820
Dad.

348
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:45,896
Honey, you're way too young

349
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,390
to be going off to the
woods with whoever.

350
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:49,206
It's with the church.

351
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,462
I don't care who it's with.

352
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:51,296
Mom.

353
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,456
It's okay, honey, we'll
talk about it later.

354
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,816
We just talked about it.

355
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,126
The answer is no.

356
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,101
And what are you
doing with a phone?

357
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,568
What eight year old has a phone?

358
00:24:58,592 --> 00:24:59,592
Gimme that.

359
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:32,863
That we won't survive

360
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:39,601
laying our weapons down

361
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:56,534
the truth and the lyin'

362
00:25:57,696 --> 00:26:01,179
done and I need you

363
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:04,789
will come to my rescue.

364
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,197
What brings you to Texas?

365
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:34,446
You from around here?

366
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:39,470
No, my wife was
pregnant with my son

367
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,693
when I was in Afghanistan

368
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:43,283
and then decided she
wanted to be with her ex.

369
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,183
Took my son to Tahoe and my dog.

370
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,146
Took everything that I
had spent three tours

371
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,520
going up to the house with.

372
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,653
All my money in my
bank account gone.

373
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:59,706
I'm on my way back to Kentucky
to be close to my son.

374
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,576
But nothing.

375
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,926
Coal trucks, coal mines,
drugs and alcohol back there.

376
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,496
My buddy told me to stay at
his house down here Texas

377
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,120
and that didn't work out either.

378
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,493
Yeah, can you tell me
that your time overseas.

379
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:23,499
Did you ever feel like
you saw the explosion

380
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:25,126
and the tracer rounds coming?

381
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,053
Hey, I'm gonna stop you there.

382
00:27:28,456 --> 00:27:29,407
I don't talk about
that stuff man.

383
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:31,629
Yeah, there was one time
that we were in this camp.

384
00:27:31,653 --> 00:27:32,770
Look man, I asked you.

385
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,646
Just came in so
fast and it started.

386
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,176
All right.

387
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,366
I appreciate what
you're doing, man.

388
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,913
I really do, but I'm not into
the whole counseling bit.

389
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,850
Adam, wait.

390
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,260
Sorry for pushing you, man.

391
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,616
Listen, love to have
you over for a hot meal,

392
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,366
take a hot shower.

393
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:01,593
We can throw a ball game on
and just hang out, two Vets.

394
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,460
You gonna eat that burger?

395
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,270
Take it man, it's all yours.

396
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,370
Maybe.

397
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,230
Thank you.

398
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,986
Tubby, you got the rear?

399
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,583
Yeah, I got it.

400
00:28:34,607 --> 00:28:36,569
Gamma, go pull security on rear.

401
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:37,893
Alpha, we got inventory.

402
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,294
Let's move.

403
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,504
We got a live one.

404
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,945
Take him, take him, take him.

405
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:10,218
Who are you?

406
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:25,727
- Hey, good to see you.
- Hey.

407
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:27,159
Yeah.

408
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:31,071
I am sorry to just
come by like this.

409
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:32,346
If you wanna do a different day.

410
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,770
No, it's fine, come on in.

411
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,727
You sure?

412
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,706
Absolutely, come on.

413
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,563
Honey, look who it is.

414
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,463
Oh, hi, hi, I'm Nancy,
nice to meet you.

415
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Come on in.

416
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:53,021
Come on.

417
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,806
You know what, let me go
get Amber, she's outside.

418
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,116
That's a good idea.

419
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,336
Oh yeah, you can
meet my daughter.

420
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Daughter.

421
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,856
You didn't tell me
you had a daughter.

422
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,246
How old is she?

423
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,599
I might send her.

424
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,746
She's eight going on 15.

425
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,170
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

426
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,257
Well, any case you have
a bathroom or something,

427
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:19,636
where I can freshen up?

428
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,470
Oh, I'm sorry, yeah,

429
00:30:20,494 --> 00:30:22,346
it's right down there to
the right, help yourself.

430
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,370
Sure.

431
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:45,036
- Hey.
- Hey.

432
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,870
Where's Adam.

433
00:30:45,894 --> 00:30:48,216
Oh he's in the bathroom,
he'll be right back.

434
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Okay.

435
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:51,396
Honey.

436
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,988
Don't worry, he's a good guy.

437
00:30:54,012 --> 00:30:54,979
I know.

438
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:58,106
I just wish you would have
told me he was coming.

439
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,926
Well, I didn't even
know he was coming.

440
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,483
I mean, I invited him, but.

441
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,090
Look, he's been through a lot

442
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,423
and he doesn't have anyone
to help him like I do.

443
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,971
Oh, oh Adam.

444
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:22,716
Please take a seat, I'm
gonna get dinner started.

445
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,240
Yeah, man, come one, gives
us more time to talk.

446
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,423
Hi, I'm Amber, nice to meet you.

447
00:31:37,712 --> 00:31:38,712
Hi.

448
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:41,196
Where do you live?

449
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,198
Amber.

450
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,032
What?

451
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:44,663
No, it's all right.

452
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Well I guess the easiest
way to explain that is,

453
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
outside.

454
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,826
It's kinda like
camping, every night,

455
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,113
I get to look at the
stars, look for planets,

456
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,266
lightening bugs,
crickets and birds

457
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,866
and listen to them all nice.

458
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,023
It's pretty cool.

459
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,663
I wish I could go camping.

460
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:17,606
Maybe your dad will
take you one day.

461
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,036
I was supposed to go to
church camp this summer

462
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,685
but dad says I can't go.

463
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:25,448
Hey, we said, we'll
talk about it.

464
00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:27,576
We said, we'll talk about it?

465
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,606
- You said no.
- Well,

466
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,796
I'm still thinking about it.

467
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,913
Why your dad's just
trying to protect you.

468
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,376
Hey, my dad did the
same thing to me.

469
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,236
I was your age, we had this big
tree in the backyard, right,

470
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,836
and I wanted to climb it so bad,

471
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,626
dad didn't want me to
get hurt, told me not to.

472
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,036
I came home from school one day

473
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,566
and he was late
getting home from work.

474
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,733
You know what I did?

475
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:53,796
You climbed the tree.

476
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,809
All the way to the
top, all the way.

477
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:59,476
But I was too scared
once I got up there,

478
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,536
I couldn't get back down.

479
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,726
Then how'd you get down?

480
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,770
The easiest way
possible. I fell.

481
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,626
Hit most of the branches
on the way down too.

482
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,446
I didn't break any
bones or anything,

483
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,976
but my dad didn't
have any trouble

484
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,943
keeping me out of
the tree after that.

485
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:07,722
No, seriously thank you
guys for everything.

486
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,530
Absolutely, it was our pleasure.

487
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,726
Hey, the offer still stands,

488
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,593
you sure you don't
want to stay the night?

489
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:26,621
I'm good.

490
00:34:26,645 --> 00:34:28,837
I got it, I'm okay, thank you.

491
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
- Anytime.
- Bye.

492
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,383
Have you been gonna
those meetings with Tom?

493
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,653
I missed the last one.

494
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:14,833
And the one before that.

495
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,677
Have you been going
to any at all?

496
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:29,506
- Listen.
- No, you listen Gary,

497
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,646
you can't keep doing this.

498
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,020
It's not good for the kids.

499
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,103
I'm trying to stay
away from them.

500
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:37,127
What?

501
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:40,104
No, that's not what they want.

502
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:42,776
Gary, they don't want you
to stay away from them.

503
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,656
We miss you.

504
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,363
We want you to be with us.

505
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,453
Fight for us,

506
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:52,033
like You fought for our country.

507
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,143
Is it too much to ask you to
come to the game next week?

508
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,890
It's the first of the playoffs.

509
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,903
Could you at least call
Tom about the meetings?

510
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,187
- It might actually help.
- Listen, I'll go.

511
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,323
I'll go to the game next week.

512
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,440
It wasn't like a charm or
anything to protect us.

513
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,353
It was just a reminder
that God was with us.

514
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,830
Whatever you gotta
do to get through it.

515
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:43,747
Oh, I'm sorry,

516
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:46,826
I know you didn't want
to talk about this stuff.

517
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,650
Can I ask you if
you believe in God?

518
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,163
You could ask, but
I couldn't say.

519
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,666
I mean, I've had moments

520
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,690
where everything's just falling
into place and I thank God.

521
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,303
Like most people
would say, I guess.

522
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,293
I've had other times where,

523
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:20,580
I swear it was like, God
was just out to kill me.

524
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,593
I guess what you call
God, I call luck.

525
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,773
It's not predictable,

526
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,513
it doesn't discriminate,

527
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,336
it doesn't care about anyone

528
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,187
or anything it
touches or breaks.

529
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,703
What's that picture
up there, man?

530
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,173
My squad, second
tour in Afghanistan.

531
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,823
See that guy third
from the right?

532
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:20,286
Yeah.

533
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,310
That was Mikey.

534
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,850
Amazing man.

535
00:38:26,925 --> 00:38:29,173
He had a beautiful
wife, three kids.

536
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,743
One night, we were
out on a night patrol,

537
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,393
we were ambushed from all sides.

538
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,593
Somehow I found some cover.

539
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Mikey didn't.

540
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,010
Everything in this world
is black and white.

541
00:38:57,267 --> 00:39:02,033
Everything is
either good or evil.

542
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,966
Nobody realizes that they've
seen the things we've seen

543
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,673
and done the things
that we've done.

544
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:24,876
I was in the Shah Joy District

545
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,343
in the Zabul Province
of Afghanistan,

546
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,390
that night we went on patrol
and I stepped on an IED.

547
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,330
It coulda killed everybody.

548
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,396
I'm not a bomb maker, I
don't know what happened,

549
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,436
but it went off but
it didn't explode.

550
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,713
We were you're just
covered at HME powder.

551
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,666
And so many guys that have lost,

552
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,596
that had wives and kids
and dogs and families

553
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,196
and the rest of the rest
of their life to live

554
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,093
and I shoulda died
over there man.

555
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Hey.

556
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,546
Maybe the fact that
the IED didn't explode

557
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,853
means God has a bigger
purpose for your life.

558
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,393
A second chance.

559
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,200
And I'm sure that us
meeting was no accident.

560
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,646
You sound like a preacher man.

561
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,574
Well, that's what they
called me in the army.

562
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,476
If you wanna hear
someone, who's way better,

563
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,056
you should come to
our church tomorrow.

564
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,230
Everyone there would
love to have you, man.

565
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,130
No pressure,

566
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,093
it's just an offer.

567
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,806
In recent weeks, we've
examined the themes of courage,

568
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:07,736
love and sacrifice, as
seen in the life of Jesus.

569
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,760
As I've said, in many ways,
Jesus was like a soldier.

570
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,436
This world was enemy
territory that he entered into

571
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,793
knowing what would
happen to him.

572
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,226
But he gave his life, not
only for those who loved him,

573
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,416
but for those who hated him,

574
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,273
including the very ones who
nailed him to the cross.

575
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,070
Think about that.

576
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,023
Paul writes in Romans 5,

577
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:42,403
"Very rarely will anyone
die for a righteous person

578
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:44,413
"though for a good person,

579
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:47,873
"someone might
possibly dare to die.

580
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:51,223
"But God demonstrates his
own love for us in this."

581
00:41:52,117 --> 00:41:57,057
"While we were still
sinners, Christ died for us."

582
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,133
But the story doesn't
end there, does it?

583
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,716
On the third day
after his death,

584
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,416
Jesus rose again.

585
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,736
And what that means is that
we can be raised to new life,

586
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,556
forgiven our sins and
made right with God.

587
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,856
If we simply turn
to him in faith,

588
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,996
turn away from our
sins and trust in Jesus

589
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,450
instead of ourselves

590
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,313
and God will heal us no
matter how broken we are.

591
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,247
Hey, your right, in your right.

592
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,267
Clear.

593
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:08,919
Keep it together Tubby,
keep it together.

594
00:44:08,943 --> 00:44:13,943
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Okay.

595
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:27,576
Hey sweetie, what are you doing?

596
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,876
I'm baking cookies
for the picnic.

597
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,196
I see that.

598
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,956
And that's a great thought,

599
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,556
but why don't you let
Mommy take over from here

600
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,176
and then you can
help me frost them.

601
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,116
I hope Adam's gonna love these.

602
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,596
I know he will have those.

603
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Let me do this and.

604
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:47,175
You're getting it
all over Mommy.

605
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:02,746
Hey Pastor, how's it going?

606
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,273
Brandon, hi, it's.

607
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,963
I'm not sure how to tell
you this, it's about Adam.

608
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,346
Well, what about him?

609
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,903
He's dead.

610
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,036
I have a good friend
who's a police officer,

611
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,906
they found him late last night.

612
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,930
And it looks like he
took his own life.

613
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,053
I'm so sorry, Brandon.

614
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,273
Damen right, Damen Mudrick?

615
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,856
You served one tour to
Iraq, two to Afghanistan.

616
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,876
Yes, sir.

617
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,526
Oh, based on your last mission,

618
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,106
you were awarded
the Bronze Star.

619
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,223
Congratulations.

620
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,366
I think it's fair to
say that you've fallen

621
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,626
on some hard times haven't you?

622
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:12,650
It's fair to say.

623
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,290
Do you know this man?

624
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,396
He was handed over
to us by the Iraqis.

625
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,146
They say he's Al Qaeda.

626
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,166
He says that you
gave him something,

627
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,606
something very important.

628
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,230
Sergeant, what did you give him?

629
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,170
We lost a few guys outside
the city to these RPGs,

630
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,393
coming inside this warehouse,

631
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,570
they doused the
building with gunfire.

632
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,060
My team took the top floor.

633
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,310
We were only there

634
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,313
to make sure that there
were no survivors.

635
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,386
Tubby you got the rear?

636
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,916
Yeah, I got it.

637
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,236
Gamma, go pull security on rear.

638
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,717
Alpha, we got
inventory, let's move.

639
00:48:06,741 --> 00:48:08,837
Captain, we got aa live one.

640
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:11,444
Take him, take him, take him.

641
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,476
He was in bad shape.

642
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,823
We figured it die so.

643
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:22,543
So what?

644
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
So we left him.

645
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,243
Sergeant, this man should
have been a prisoner.

646
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,803
Sergeant, what did you give him?

647
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,775
We gotta get outta here.

648
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,757
Hurry, hurry.

649
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:55,293
I gave him a bible.

650
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:57,896
An English bible.

651
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:23,936
Hey.

652
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:26,889
Hey, good morning, Pastor James.

653
00:49:26,913 --> 00:49:27,983
Good morning, may I?

654
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:28,817
Absolutely.

655
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,658
A bus picks her up
down the corner.

656
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:32,970
Is Brandon here?

657
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:33,804
Yeah, yeah.

658
00:49:33,828 --> 00:49:35,106
It's okay, if I speak
with him for a moment?

659
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:35,976
Come on in.

660
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Thank you.

661
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,183
Brandon, there's no way
he could have known.

662
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:06,576
I have heard so many stories

663
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,363
of people who seemed
completely fine.

664
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,720
You just don't know.

665
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,863
There's nothing you
could have done.

666
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,600
But you knew you could
have done something?

667
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,600
God.

668
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,346
God was there.

669
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:30,620
Just watching when Adam
picked up that knife.

670
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,306
He was watching as he
slit each of his wrists

671
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,883
and he didn't do a
thing to stop it.

672
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,296
God was there when Adam
was in Afghanistan,

673
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,516
seeing people's
limbs get blown off,

674
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,076
children get shot,

675
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,486
but he didn't stop it.

676
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,736
No, all he did was stop
the bomb from going off

677
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,336
just to make sure Adam lived
a little bit longer to suffer

678
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,933
before he died anyway.

679
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,960
That's the God I preached
to dozens of soldiers

680
00:51:02,918 --> 00:51:05,563
and said he loved them and
wanted the best for them.

681
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,206
Meeting you was the best thing

682
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,103
that could've ever
happened to Adam.

683
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,826
God used you to
help save his soul,

684
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,050
even if none of us could
help save his life.

685
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,913
So that's it.

686
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,953
That's all he promises.

687
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,513
Nothing for this life.

688
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,266
Ella we made it to the playoffs.

689
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,207
Emma was great.

690
00:51:45,231 --> 00:51:48,703
I know, Angela didn't
even miss one goal.

691
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,686
What is the matter with you?

692
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,116
You coulda hurt me,
don't you pay attention

693
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,017
to what you're doing?

694
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,133
What is going on?

695
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,603
I'm sorry.

696
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,736
I was laying on the.

697
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,714
I was just, I was trying
to, I'm sorry listen.

698
00:52:03,738 --> 00:52:04,702
Go to your room.

699
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:05,776
Go to your room.

700
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,650
Right now, go, go,
it's okay, go, go.

701
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:10,943
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

702
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,073
Gary, you need help.

703
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,940
Help, yeah okay.

704
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:20,156
I'm gonna go see Tom
in his bible friends

705
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,226
so that they can
quote cliches at me

706
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,763
and tell me what a
horrible person I am.

707
00:52:23,787 --> 00:52:25,888
You're not a horrible person.

708
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:28,853
But you need help, but I can't
give it to you, I have tried.

709
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,126
Gary, you listen
to me right now.

710
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,093
I will not let you
hurt our children.

711
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,387
Even if it means I take
them away from you.

712
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,229
Get the medic, come on.

713
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:38,761
Chris, Chris, come on man.

714
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:40,359
Chris please look at me.

715
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,193
Look at me.

716
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,693
- Come on, come on.
- We can make it.

717
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,729
Gotta come on.

718
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:45,955
Hang in there, hang in there.

719
00:53:45,979 --> 00:53:49,397
We can stay here, we can't
stay here, man, come on.

720
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,000
He believed you, you know,

721
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:08,890
we all did.

722
00:54:10,387 --> 00:54:12,003
Damen, I'm so sorry.

723
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,180
Strangest thing though,

724
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,823
this mission, when
we first started out,

725
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,040
had to clearest feeling
that I was gonna die.

726
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,673
Can I see your bible, I
don't have mine anymore.

727
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,670
Read that.

728
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,790
Verse four.

729
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:04,223
"He will wipe away every
tear from your eyes.

730
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:09,247
"There will be no more death
or mourning or crying or pain"

731
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:12,757
"for the old order of
things has passed away."

732
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,710
Chris found that
one the other day.

733
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,763
He always liked to read
from the end of the book.

734
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,270
Do you want to
know what's better

735
00:55:28,294 --> 00:55:29,930
than having every
tear wiped away?

736
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,693
Never having to cry
'em in the first place.

737
00:55:57,154 --> 00:55:58,087
I just want to go.

738
00:55:58,111 --> 00:55:59,723
I need to see my family again.

739
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,743
Tom, it's Gary.

740
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,843
What time did you say
that meeting was again?

741
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,406
Welcome everyone,
I'd like to thank you

742
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,756
for coming to today's meeting.

743
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,016
I know it's time away from
your family, but we are family,

744
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,776
we have a bond of brotherhood

745
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,486
and it's great that
you can come here

746
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,394
and share time with us.

747
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:22,586
It's a safe place to
talk about things,

748
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,726
if you feel like
talking about it

749
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,626
or listen to the
experiences of others.

750
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,050
Thanks again for being here.

751
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,370
So I did a two tours in Iraq

752
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:40,810
and when I come home,
life's never been the same.

753
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,233
I have anger issues and
these demons in my head,

754
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,676
it's hard to sleep at night

755
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,033
and I know I'm
hard to live with,

756
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,263
with all the issues
that I deal with.

757
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,723
My wife left me.

758
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,010
She couldn't deal
with it anymore.

759
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,406
I don't have a
relationship with my kids.

760
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:10,430
It's just me,

761
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:12,703
me and the demons.

762
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,790
His first assignment was in Iraq

763
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,433
and he said, "Honey,
you stay home"

764
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:24,347
"and plan the wedding while
I go and defend our country."

765
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,046
So off he went

766
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,523
and I went home and started
planning the wedding.

767
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,463
But Daniel never came home.

768
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:43,306
And there was no wedding.

769
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,426
He called us one day and he said

770
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,920
that they were shipping
him out to Afghanistan

771
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,233
and he promised
me, he'd be back.

772
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,093
I'm gonna tell you I prayed
every single day for him.

773
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,103
As a mom, I was never so scared.

774
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,383
I remember the day
sitting in that chair,

775
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,743
right in front of that
flag-draped casket.

776
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:21,373
And I said, there is no way
that my son is in that casket.

777
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,163
They didn't even have
much to identify.

778
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,460
I know the government
made a huge mistake

779
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,763
and my son is gonna come home
to me, just like you promised.

780
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,136
- You said 12:30.
- Around 12:30.

781
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,503
12:30 again.

782
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,310
So you off next week.

783
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:54,820
You guys just open a Walmart?

784
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,520
We're the Honor Guard.

785
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,203
We conduct military service
for a fallen brothers.

786
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,367
And this is Doug,

787
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:10,083
we just slewed his casket today.

788
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,326
Doug was the comrade
here at the VFW Post 573.

789
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,250
I've known him ever
since I was a kid.

790
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,326
We do about a hundred
funerals a year.

791
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,350
A hundred?

792
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,223
I'm so sorry guys,
I didn't know.

793
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,043
That's what we do,
we continue to serve.

794
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:37,303
And we're always
looking for new members.

795
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,943
Hi, my name's Thomas.

796
01:00:47,403 --> 01:00:48,953
I'm not really here for myself,

797
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,673
I'm here for my
father, these were his.

798
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,756
Every 4th of July, we would all

799
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,466
watch the fireworks together
as family, you know.

800
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,093
And after he came back,

801
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,536
he didn't want to watch
'em with us anymore.

802
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,343
You said they
scared him too much.

803
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:20,063
The other night my
father took his own life.

804
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,540
Now I gotta explain
to my little brother

805
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,060
why his daddy's not
gonna be around anymore.

806
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:33,816
How do you explain
to a 12 year old kid

807
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,990
that his dad's not
gonna be around anymore?

808
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,686
I appreciate everyone sharing.

809
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:46,396
Thank you for being here,
it means a lot to everyone.

810
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,283
Before we close, does anybody
else have anything to add?

811
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:56,270
Yeah, I got something.

812
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,263
My name is Gary
Newhouse, sergeant, Army.

813
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:11,616
My friends are well,
my fellow soldiers,

814
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
they call me Tubby.

815
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:17,616
I joined the military
because I needed change,

816
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,113
I needed a direction.

817
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:22,563
And I did get change.

818
01:02:27,192 --> 01:02:30,266
You know, my unit,
we had this idea

819
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:34,646
that if we carried Bibles
with us everywhere we went,

820
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:37,323
we would be safe,
we'd be protected.

821
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:42,033
But obviously that didn't
do us too much good.

822
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:47,856
We were stationed up on a
fob in the Kunar Valley,

823
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,713
small ambushes day and night.

824
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,783
And I'd find myself asking,

825
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,483
where's God in all of this?

826
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,043
But I know now, I know
that God is with me,

827
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,183
he's the only reason I'm here.

828
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,196
Are you sure you
want to do this?

829
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,220
Yes sir, I am.

830
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,156
This is very serious.

831
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,426
You want to see it from a
different perspective, son?

832
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:24,393
You hand a flag to a
wife or a daughter,

833
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,530
you watch their hearts break
at the playing of, "Taps."

834
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,913
I know how hard it is.

835
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,320
But you have another chance.

836
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,576
Just don't let
your mind go dark.

837
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,773
'Cause when you do,

838
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,250
it's over.

839
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,966
Well, there they are.

840
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,340
You want me to go with you?

841
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,597
No, I got to do this
myself, thanks though.

842
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:45,927
Shine your light on me

843
01:05:55,008 --> 01:05:59,587
know you don't need me.

844
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:53,750
Hello.

845
01:06:53,774 --> 01:06:55,145
Preacher.

846
01:06:55,169 --> 01:06:57,639
Damen, what's going on man.

847
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,096
I tried calling
since we got back,

848
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,766
but the number you
gave me doesn't work.

849
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:02,863
Yeah, yeah.

850
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:07,626
Hey listen, do you
remember that mission

851
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:10,723
at the warehouse
right before Chris?

852
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,536
Anyway, that wounded guy,

853
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,626
you remember I
gave him my bible?

854
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:17,666
Yeah.

855
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,176
You're not gonna believe this.

856
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,406
I can barely believe it,
I can barely believe it,

857
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:21,480
but he's still alive.

858
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,842
If it wasn't for you, none
of this would have happened.

859
01:07:25,866 --> 01:07:28,996
What, what wouldn't
have happened?

860
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,826
He took that one bible,

861
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:31,946
and over the last two years,

862
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:34,283
he's been planting
churches all over Iraq.

863
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,976
He wasn't even a terrorist,

864
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,886
they were holding
him against his will.

865
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,266
And he's been.

866
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,690
What are the odds of that?

867
01:07:44,816 --> 01:07:45,627
I don't know about you,

868
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:49,253
but I left Iraq thinking
that God was nowhere in it.

869
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:52,356
But because of what you did,

870
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,381
hundreds of people ain't
saved over there right now.

871
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,993
And that's not all,

872
01:07:57,017 --> 01:07:59,736
Yasin, that's his
name, Pastor Yasin.

873
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,716
And I got to meet him.

874
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,936
The government granted
him asylum here.

875
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,076
He tried to thank me
for saving his life.

876
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,496
But I told him that you were
the one that gave me a bible.

877
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,033
He'd like to meet
you if that's cool.

878
01:08:10,057 --> 01:08:12,636
Well great, I'd like
to meet him too,

879
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,016
and see you again.

880
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,133
Where are you guys?

881
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:35,093
After we last met in Jalalabad,

882
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,213
they put me in the military.

883
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:41,627
I refused to join

884
01:08:43,517 --> 01:08:45,283
and they called me terrorist,

885
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:48,876
sympathizer to American.

886
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,176
They put me back in the prison.

887
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,263
After that, they traded
me to your government.

888
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,923
I have this for years now.

889
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,653
I have read it many, many times.

890
01:09:06,697 --> 01:09:08,843
And this is what I
come to know about it.

891
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:15,433
God always will finish
the work he has started.

892
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,040
I think it's awesome,

893
01:09:44,064 --> 01:09:45,966
he's gonna get
housing assistance.

894
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:48,463
I just wish more homeless
veterans would get that.

895
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:51,763
Yeah, I tried for it but.

896
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,853
Look, when I got back home,

897
01:09:57,852 --> 01:10:00,056
I didn't even wanna
stay at my old place,

898
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,180
Chris and I shared it.

899
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,353
Everything just reminded
me of him, you know.

900
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,260
So where do you live now?

901
01:10:09,146 --> 01:10:11,176
Well, I mean, I got some money.

902
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,550
The government wasn't
totally without sympathy.

903
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,816
I'll be all right.

904
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,090
I'll get back on my feet.

905
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:40,330
Of wrong in my life

906
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:58,694
in our bed tonight

907
01:12:05,322 --> 01:12:08,691
took one to figure out

908
01:12:43,262 --> 01:12:46,391
it's just you and me

909
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,538
eye and I can't seem to see

910
01:12:57,562 --> 01:13:02,562
so blind it almost sees.

911
01:13:21,169 --> 01:13:24,340
I know they're just fine

912
01:13:24,364 --> 01:13:28,324
and our dreams tonight

913
01:13:35,788 --> 01:13:40,771
me and see everything

914
01:13:45,948 --> 01:13:50,948
when daddy is home now
