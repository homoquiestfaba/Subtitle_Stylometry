00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,958
and coming to your wedding.

167
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,666
Isn't that nice? It's very nice!

168
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,101
- [Owen] Yes, it is! Thanks, Mom.
- [Parker] Yeah. Super nice.

169
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,791
[whispers] She hasn't
seen her parents for a very long time.

170
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,708
I know. I know.

171
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,250
- How come they're not showing up?
- They live in a cave in the jungle.

172
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,416
- Like Bin Laden?
- A little like Bin Laden, right.

173
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,791
- [Owen] Um, that's... That's not it.
- It's okay, I got it.

174
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,541
- Can I see your tattoos again?
- Oh, um, not right now.

175
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,708
Your Aunt Margie
isn't the biggest fan, so, shh.

176
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,351
She said you got them so you
could get bigger tips when you strip.

177
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:05,125
- Uh, once again, I'm not a stripper.
- My boyfriend's gonna get a tattoo.

178
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:08,125
- [Parker] Oh, yeah? Of what?
- My name across his lower back.

179
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,916
- [exclaims]
- Hey, cuz!

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,041
Jesus! Hi, buddy. Well, don't...

181
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,333
How come I wasn't
invited to the, uh, bachelor party?

182
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,333
- You know I'm, like, an EMT now, right?
- [mutters] I do know that, yeah.

183
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, well, I'd love to give you
a ride in the ambulance.

184
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,000
- You know, hit the siren, zip around town.
- [Owen's father] That's fun.

185
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,250
Yeah, maybe, uh, flatline you in the back,
go to the other side.

186
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,166
Ask Grandpa Seymour
what it was like dying by, you know...

187
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,333
[imitates choking and grunting]

188
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,125
[Owen's father] Okay, stop it. All right.

189
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,934
- [Owen] Why is he doing that?
- [Owen's father] That was a rumor. Stop.

190
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,791
No, man. She walked in on it.
She was so sad when she found him.

191
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,375
Guy's a legend, died beating off.

192
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,017
- [Owen's mother gasps]
- [phone ringing]

193
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,561
I'm getting a phone call. Lucky for me.
I didn't even plan this.

194
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,375
This just happened coincidentally.
Hey, storage space!

195
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,208
Ah, thanks for returning my call!

196
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,083
- This is Owen Browning again.
- What the fuck do you want?

197
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,625
Well, I'm getting married in a week,

198
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,083
so I'm putting together
a little photo montage.

199
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:05,458
But here's the thing, I don't have
any photos of my fiancée's family.

200
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,208
And rumor has it that they actually
have a unit in your storage facility.

201
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,875
Um, it should be under the name McDermott.

202
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,458
- [sinister note plays]
<i>- Do... Do you have the locker?</i>

203
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,901
- [Owen's mother] Oh, my God!
- [Owen's father] I'm on fire!

204
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,875
- [man] EMT!
- Oh, shit.

205

209
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:33,208
Yeah. You told me to call if anyone
asked about the McDermott locker.

210
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,875
[woman] McDermott locker?

211
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,583
Yes.

212
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,041
Do you have a name?

213
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,541
Owen Browning.

214
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,000
These diamonds are shit.

215
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,666

[exhales softly]

217
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,708
What is it?

218
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,916
It's silly. I thought that...

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,500
[laughs] I thought that button was
a trap door to a shark tank or something.

220
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,375
[laughs] Trap door? No!

221
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,000
I just wanted someone
to come clean up this mess.

222
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,916
- What mess?
- You.

223
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,416
[softly] "Shark tank."

224
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
Call the aquarium!

225
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,250
Does your dad always keep
an extra shirt in the trunk of his car?

226
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,791
[Owen] Ha! Yeah, well...

227
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,642
It's not the first time
he caught on fire in a restaurant.

228
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,375
And then how about
when your niece asked me

229
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,333
if my neck flaps in the wind
when I ride a bicycle?

230
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,375
Thank you for not being offended.

231
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,375
They are truly disturbed people.

232
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,500
Ugh, God. Now, you're gonna
have to meet my family.

233
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,416
- Are you worried they won't like me?
- No, not at all. Are you?

234
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,166
No! Mmm-mmm.

235
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,208
Not liking you
is like not liking Mr. Rogers.

236

The Notorious F-R-E...

237
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,375
D.

238
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,291
- When do they come into town?
- Not until the night before the wedding.

239
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,041
Oh! That gives me just enough time.

240
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,750
Oh, yeah? Time for what?

241
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,875
[muffled] I've got
something special planned.

242
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,666
Oh! Is that right?

243
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,916
- Love it.

Okay, yeah, yeah.
Do that thing you like to do.

- [Parker] Really?
- [both agreeing]

Uh, just a little ditty
that I was doing in private.

313
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,625
Didn't know it was, uh,
in front of my future in-laws.

- The door was unlocked.

That is weird, 'cause
I never forget to lock the front door.

Are you calling my wife a liar? Huh?

Is that it?

318
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,166

00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,750
There's one thing you need to know
about me, my family has hip issues.

329
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,541
And, obviously, wanted to get ahead of it.

330
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,208
Went to the doctor.
She said, "Have you tried yoga?"

331
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,000
- [Billy chuckles]
- [Owen] Got a coupon.

332
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,958
Went to my first yoga class...

333
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,875
- It was my class.
- [laughing]

334
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,333
I was teaching the class!
I mean, what are the odds?

335
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,416
- Crazy!
- Right?

336
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,958
[chuckles] That's amazing.

337
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:29,041
So then I noticed that halfway
through the class, Owen's in child's pose.

338
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,833
Yep. Okay, so get this.

339
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,791
Okay, I'm in child's pose.

340
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:37,208
And while I'm in child's pose,
I pass out, but no one notices. Look.

341
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,166
[laughing] Look.

342
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,392
If I was unconscious right now,
you couldn't even tell.

343
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,856
- [Parker] Right?
- [Billy] Oh, yeah.

344
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,000
So then everyone leaves, class is over,

345
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,416
and I notice that
Owen's still in child's pose.

346
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,625
And I think to myself,

347
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:52,125
"Oh, fuck. This guy just died.
He's dead. He's a goner."

348
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,541
- Mmm-mmm. But I didn't.
- [Parker] Nope.

349
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,333
Then, when Parker unfolded me,
and I came to,

350
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,583
I looked up at her big, beautiful smile,
and I realized...

351
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,458
"This is the woman
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with."

352
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,583
- And you were right.
- Yes, I was.

353
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,125
Aww.

354
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,708
- And then you asked her out.
- No, actually.

355
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,591
I went to her class for a year and a half
and she finally asked me out.

356
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,041
[big band music playing]

358
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,958
<i>♪ Honey dew, honey dew, honey dew ♪</i>

359
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,041
[scoffs] I can't find anyone
to cover my class,

360
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,458
so I'm just gonna have to cancel.

361
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,501
- [Owen] Mmm-mmm.
- Make sure my parents are okay.

362
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,583
I'm not gonna
let you get in trouble at work.

363
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,208
I have 178 sick days already saved up.
I already called in.

364
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,208
- It's not about... No... Actually, babe...
- I got you, don't worry about it!

365
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,500
- Don't worry, I got it! Oh, hey!
- [Lilly] Aw!

366
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,708
- Good morning, future family.
- [Parker] Hi!

367
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,666
- Good morning! Morning, Dad.
- [Billy] Nice to see you. Good morning.

368
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,458
So I have to go into work today,
but Owen is taking his first day off

369
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,981
since he started at the bank,
he's gonna show you guys around.

370
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,500
- Right, babe?
- [Owen] Exciting!

371
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,333
- [hooting wildly]
- [laughing]

372
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:04,791
I don't like my tushy touched,
and she finds it hilarious.

373
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,958
- I do!
- It scares me... something about it.

374
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,583
- All right, well, I'll see you tonight.
- Okay. Bye.

375
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,875
- You two, behave. All right? Be nice.
- [Billy] Bye, bye, darling.

376
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,601
- [Parker] It means a lot to him. Be good.
- Love you. We'll be good.

377
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,000
- [Owen] Bye! Love you!
- Bye!

378
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,958
Okay! Oh! You want some OJ?
Good. Good, good, good.

379
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,875
[Billy] I do.

380
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,541
So, hope you guys are hungry,

381
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,875
because I've got...

382
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,875
baked eggs Florentine.

383
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,083
We have some roasted... [hooting wildly]

384
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,708
[laughing] Got in there deep.

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,125
Okay, uh... Well, enough about breakfast.

386
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,666
I hope you're ready to have some fun
because I got us tickets

387
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,375
to a South American pottery exhibition.

388
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,833
Why?

389
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:53,708
Because you guys were living
with the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon...

390
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,666
Oh! Oh, yeah.

391
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,416
...who obviously are
known for their exquisite pottery.

392
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,250
We spent so many years with that tribe
that we're all potteried out.

393
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:05,333
All right, well, let's go
to the next step of our adventure.

394
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,791
The Holocaust Museum!

395
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,875
Honestly, I've been there, like... I would...
They've got an amazing food court!

396
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,125
[groans]

397
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,916
Okay!

398
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,916
Look, we're not into pottery
and we're not into Holocaust awareness.

399
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,083
Fine. What do you guys want to do?

400
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,791
- [hard rock music playing]
- [screaming]

401
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,708
[Owen screaming] Pull the chute!
Pull the chute!

402
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:34,125
[Billy] Not until you convince me
why I should let you marry my daughter!

403
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:38,708
[Owen] Oh, God!
She's my best friend, and I love her!

404
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,583
Oh, God! Oh, God!

405
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,833
- I dog sit! I tip 20%!
- Not good enough!

406
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,208
[Owen dejectedly]
I'll never have sex with her again.

407
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,833
- [Billy] Keep going!
- I'm pulling the cord!

408
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,416
[Billy] That's my cock, you idiot!

409
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,166
[hard rock music continues]

00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,083
[tattoo guns humming]

411
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,500
You know, I was thinking
about choosing a Shrek character,

412
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,708
because it's my favorite,
but I don't know,

413
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,666
this moon is really speaking to me, right?

414
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,041
Okay. That looks pretty...

415
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,166
[shrieking]

416
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,333
Ow! What? What...

417
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,333
Ahh!

418
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,875
Ahh!

419
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,750
- [upbeat music playing]
- [Owen] Whoo!

420
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,000
[laughing]

421
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,333
[grimacing comically]

422
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,541
Let's go! Oh, man.

423
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,166
Could you guys believe I got a tattoo?

424
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,416
[laughing] Who even am I right now?
This is a tattoo, it's a moon.

425
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,041
[imitates howling] I'm like a wolf.

426
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,333
[howling]

427
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,875
Bill, why don't you get us another round?
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

428
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,500
That's a good idea, Lilly.

429
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,791
I'll come with! Let's go!

430
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,875
[foot scuffling]

431
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,791
Mind the shoes, Owen.

432
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,625
My bad, Mister Dad. [laughing]

433
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,541
- [foot scuffling]
- [Owen exclaims]

434
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,958
Okay, that one was a little on you,

435
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,416
'cause you didn't turn around
that quickly. That's okay.

436
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,541
- [Billy] Sit!
- Yeah.

437
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:04,625
Stay.

438
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,666
Okay!

439
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,875
- I'll be right back.
- [Billy] Oh, no.

440
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,833
I'll go. You keep him company. All right?

441
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,750
[Owen] God!
He is just the coolest, isn't he?

442
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,833
It is so awesome
that you get to have sex with him.

443
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,916
- Really?
- And he smells so good!

444
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It smells like...

445
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,166
sandalwood and...

446
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,083
and danger.

447
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,083
- It's Stetson. Cologne.
- Is that what that is?

448
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,000
[sniffing]

449
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,833
How you doing, big fella?

450
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:50,458
Nice to see you again, Billy.
You look hella fine.

451
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,250
Ah, if you say so.

452
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,916
So tell me, what does
a bank manager do, exactly?

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,625
What does a bank manager not do?

454
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,583
I manage all of the employees.

455
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,833
And we have 12.

456
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,000
Really?

457
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,541
And I handle all the security,
the whole dang bank.

458
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,875
- How did you find us?
- That little cunt over there.

459
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,041
- [Billy laughs]
- He called about the storage locker.

460
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,416
- Did he?
- New colleague?

461
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,958
Uh, no, he's just a family friend.

462
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:23,458
He's an idiot.
Doesn't know what's going on.

463
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,666
He looks like a fucking idiot.

464
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,166
- Yup.
- [Owen] Billy!

465
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,458
That guy rocks!

466
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,875
[howling]

467
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,791
[vomiting loudly]

468
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,083
Yuck.

469
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,708
Jesus, there you are.
Oh, you smell like my stepdad's car.

470
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,750
[man] So, uh,
how did it go with your in-laws?

471
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:58,541
Was it regular bad,
or like really, really terrible?

472
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,708
It was incredible.

473
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,250
I've never met anyone
like these people before.

474
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,208
We went skydiving.

475
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,708
We got very drunk.

476
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,208
I did a little dancing.

477
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,458
I finally felt like I was
part of the cool crowd in high school,

478
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,958
like I'm a skateboarder,
or like I vandalize stuff or something.

479
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't, but it feels like I could.

480
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,416
It was fun. It was almost too much fun.

481
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,750
Let's just pray to the banking gods
that we have a nice, chill day.

482
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,500
[robber distorted] Everyone,
on the ground, now!

483
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,041
Ground! Let's go!

484
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,875
- Move!
- [yelling]

485
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,625
[robber] Go.

486
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,791
You, hurry up.

487
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,291
Get down! Get down!

488
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,416

[tense music playing]

491
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,291
[robber] Two minutes.

492
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:04,458
[sputtering] Look, listen, listen.
I am fully cooperating in every way.

493
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,041
And in that spirit, I have to let you know

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,041
Why are you so nervous, Owen?

661
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,166
So, I know this might sound crazy,

662
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,458
but I think Parker's parents

663
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,208
might be criminals.

664
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,541
- Yeah!
- Well, of course they're criminals.

665
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,945
Why do you think
they're skipping their daughter's wedding?

666
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,541
They're coming
to the fucking wedding! Okay?

667
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,541
[sputtering] They're literally coming!
We're...

668
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,250
Okay.

669
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,791
I think that they are the people
that robbed my bank.

670
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,125
- No! How do you know?
- I don't.

671
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:13,458
But I'm not gonna turn Parker's life
upside down unless I do know for a fact,

672
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:14,666
so I need your help, okay?

673
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,958
Okay, okay, here they come.
Do that thing you guys do.

674
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:17,916
What thing?

675
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,208
That thing where you ask highly-invasive,
inappropriate personal questions.

676
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,666
Hmm? Okay, come on!

677
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:25,416
[loudly] Hi, guys! Hey!

678
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,875
Honey. You sure you're up for this?

679
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,718
- Yeah, you?
- Oh, yeah. I took a weed gummy.

680
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:33,791
Smart! Billy and Lilly McDermott,
meet my parents Neil and Margie Browning.

681
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,083
- Pleasure to me you, Neil.
- It's my pleasure.

682
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,916
- You're very attractive.
- Oh, thank you.

683
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
That's not a compliment.
For me, it's too much.

684
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,750
[Lilly] Well, hi, there.

685
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:55,875
- Hi, hello.
- [Margie] Hi.

686
00:32:56,666 --> 00:32:58,208
[Lilly] Mmm! Oh, wow!

687
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:02,958
Speaking of attractive,
you have absolutely flawless skin.

688
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,625
What do you use?

689
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,708
Soap.

690
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,500
- Perhaps we should have some cocktails?
- [Lilly] Yeah, cocktails.

691
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,083
The sun is still out.

692
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,291
[laughs nervously] Okay, we got a table.
Let's sit down.

693
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,708
It's gonna be fun!

694
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:19,875
- [McDermotts laughing]
- And then I said,

695
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,833
"We don't need a gondolier!"

696
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,125
Lilly, she pushes
the wee fella off the boat,

697
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,291
and we start paddling up the Grand Canal.

698
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,875
[all exclaiming and laughing]

699
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,666
So, Billy, Lilly,
let me ask you something.

700
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,750
[Billy] Yeah, shoot.

701
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,833
- Have you ever committed a felony?
- [Owen gags] Mmm-mmm.

702
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:37,916
[Margie] No, no, no!

703
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,583
Now, if we're gonna be family,
we need to know if they're criminals, so...

704
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,458
- [Owen] Stop. Don't.
- Give me that. Are you criminals?

705
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,250
My parents aren't criminals.

706
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,875
No, that's okay, baby.

707
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:51,958
I'm sure our lifestyle seems a little,
um, unconventional to the Brownings.

708
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:56,166
Well, yeah, I mean they live
in the jungle with the edamame people.

709
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,333
[Owen] No, that's a bean.

710
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:59,250
- [Neil] What's the name?
- Yanomami.

711
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,166
What'd I say?

712
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,291
You said edamame,
like at a Japanese restaurant.

713
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,625
They are the people
of <i>waitheri, totihi, peheti.</i>

714
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,041
What is that now?

715
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,958
It's a common Yanomami phrase.
I'm sure you've heard it.

716
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:14,666
- Honey, what are you doing?
- Nothing! Just striking up a convo.

717
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,416
[laughs nervously]

718
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,625
Owen, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were quizzing us.

719
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:22,875
No! It's just... You lived
with the Yanomamis for two years.

720
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm sure you know what the phrase
<i>"waitheri, totihi, peheti"</i> means.

721
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,416
It means courage...

722
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,541
beauty, and truth.

723
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,916
And if we seem a little confused,
it's because your accent is so atrocious,

724
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,958
it's an affront
to the Yanomami people and their god!

725
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:51,041
Owen, what the hell is wrong with you?

726
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:55,000
Anyway!
[laughing] The Amazon is a wondrous place.

727
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,875
You two would love it.

728
00:34:56,958 --> 00:35:01,541
Well, we don't travel.
Um, Neil has traveler's diarrhea.

729
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:04,666
- It's not just when I travel.
- [Billy] Yeah.

730
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,416
Oh, Margie,
I bet under that cautious exterior,

731
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,541
there's a bubbling free spirit
waiting to get out.

732
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:17,125
Oh, no doubt this one
was really wild back in the day.

733
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:23,708
Uh, well, once,
before I was pregnant with Owen, I, um...

734
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,333
Well, I participated in an orgy.

735
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,416
[laughing]

736
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,166
- What?
- Yeah! [laughs]

737
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,916
- Mom, an orgy?
- Yeah!

738
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,041
[shouting] An orgy?

739
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,333
- [Margie] Yes!
- Yep.

740
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:34,958
I'm probably saying it wrong,

741
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:38,541
but it's that thing where you go
and you just fuck everybody.

742
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:42,208
- Oh, yeah, that's an orgy, all right.
- I had a lot of orgies.

743
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:44,916
- [all laughing]
- That's where she met Dan Marino!

744
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,916
- The football player?
- Yeah!

745
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,458
Well, it was either there or JCPenney.

746
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:53,041
Dan Marino doesn't shop at JCPenney.
He's a Hall of Famer.

747
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,291
You met Dan Marino at the orgy.

748
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,416
- Oh, Jesus Christ! So is Dad my dad?
- Of course I'm your dad!

749
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,250
Don't be ridiculous! Why do you think
you have the Browning lower back hair?

750
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:07,500
I've seen you play sports,
I know sure as shit it wasn't Dan Marino!

751
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,208
- [Owen] Wait, what?
- [Neil] Dan Marino!

752
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,500
- Here's to Danny boy.
- [Margie] Danny!

753
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,041
- [all toasting]
- [Lilly] To Danny boy!

754
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:18,791
Whoo! Touchdown! [laughing]

755
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:32,000
Hey. Okay, look.
So here's me, here's my dad.

756
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,083
The nose, the same beady,
little dead eyes.

757
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,250
It's the same, right?

758
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:40,500
- And the lower back hair.
- Sweetie, I've seen your back hair.

759
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,333
Okay, of course,
but you haven't seen my dad's.

760
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,833
- Should we FaceTime him?
- [laughs] No. Can we just talk for a sec?

761
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,791
Yeah!

762
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:53,875
Everything okay?

763
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,125
What was that at dinner?

764
00:36:56,208 --> 00:37:00,041
Oh, I don't know, just the fact
that Dan Marino fucked my mom.

765
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:03,291
Yeah, I... I know.
I know, and your bank got robbed.

766
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,541
And he's a big man.

767
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,416
He is. That's true. Um...

768
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:12,875
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
and that's extremely traumatic,

769
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,250
both things,

770
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,625
but is there something else going on?

771
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,916
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

772
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,666
I won't get mad.

773
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:23,833
[whispers] Okay?

774
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,458
Okay, all right.

775
00:37:27,416 --> 00:37:29,375
- [doors close]
- [Owen] All right.

776
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,333
So the reason I've been acting weird...

777
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,291
I think your parents robbed my bank.

778
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,541
[chuckling]

779
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,666
[Parker laughs] What?

780
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,833
- You're being serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious!

781
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,583
- One of the robbers knew my name.
- It's on the bank website.

782
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,666
But when I stepped on his heel,
he turned back,

783
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,375
and he looked at me just like your dad.

784
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,750
You said they had masks on.

785
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,000
Yes, they were wearing masks,
but it was the same

786
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,250
very specific disdain of me.

787
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,833
It's a vibe thing, you know? And...

788
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:05,875
And they knew that
"She left me roses by the stairs"

789
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:07,918
was the voice activation code
to get in the vault,

790
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,392
which I'm pretty sure
I told your mom about when I was wasted.

791
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,125
Right, okay.
Well, does anyone else know the code?

792
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,208
Just a couple... Just... Yeah.

793
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,875
Tyree, Gary, Marisol.

794
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:22,750
I think I told my therapist once,
but I don't think she listens to me.

795
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,208
- Wow!
- Okay.

796
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,416
You were the one
who said that they're a lot.

797
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,458
I meant that they have big personalities,
not that they rob banks.

798
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,708
[whispers] I'm not saying
that they are bank robbers!

799
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,958
I'm saying that there's a possibility
that they're bank robbers.

800
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:38,250
I'm just floating the idea out there.

801
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:42,416
Well, now, I'm just floating the idea
that you've lost your fucking mind.

802
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,291
- [intriguing music playing]
- [door opens]

803
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,541
[Billy] I can't believe
we have to take this shit box.

804
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:06,750
- [engine revving]
- Bank robbing son of a bitch!

805
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,416
[Owen grunts in frustration]

806
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:16,416
[suspenseful music playing]

807
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,083
Oh, Jesus Christ, this thing moves.

808
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,416
[tires squealing in distance]

809
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,750
[horn honks loudly]

810
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,125
Sor... Sorry!

811
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,583
Sorry.

812
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,541
[suspenseful music continues]

813
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,583
- [cars honking loudly]
- [brakes screeching]

814
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,250
- [honking continues]
- Okay, yep! Sorry!

815
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,958
[cars honking]

816
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,416
[Owen muttering]

817
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,416
- [honking continues]
- [man]...the fuck up!

818
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
- [honking continues]
- [tires squealing]

819
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:03,125
- [honking fades]
- [engine revving]

820
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,375
Whoo!

821
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,083
Okay. Oh, that was scary.

822
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,583
[intriguing music playing]

823
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,000
- Thank you, OnStar.
- [automated voice] <i>Happy to help.</i>

824
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,125
The prodigal son has returned,
and bearing gifts.

825
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:34,583
My God. You look like a snack.

826
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,708
I could eat your dick
like corn on the cob.

827
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,625
[intriguing music continues]

828
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,875
Is this Scarface's house? God dang.

829
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:54,875
Okay.

830
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:57,666
[grunting]

831
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,458
Ow! Come on!

832
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,000
- [thump]
- [groans] Okay.

833
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,000
Now I know why rich people have these.

834
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:09,333
- [squealing]
- [growling softly]

835
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,833
[squealing and blowing]

836
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,458
Can we get on with this?

837
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,750
[chuckling]

838
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,875
See, I just don't see
any reason why we can't be civil.

839
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:22,541
Besides, if anyone
has a right to be angry, it's me.

840
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,833
I was the one who was betrayed, right?

841
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,125
[suspenseful music playing]

842
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,416
- [dog growls]
- [exclaims]

843
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,166
- [dog yelps]
- [loud thump]

844
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,250
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry, little buddy.

845
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,125
[dogs growling and barking]

846
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,416
No, no, no, no, no!

847
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,166
There's just under a million in there.

848
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,708
Bravo. Now you just owe me five more.

849
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,375
- [dogs barking]
- [Owen] Oh, God!

850
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,458
Mini ones? What, are they cheaper?

851
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,000
We took one million, not six.

852
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,333
And have you forgotten how this works?

853
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,000
While you were running, so was the vig.

854
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:15,041
- [dogs barking]
- I'm sorry I kicked your friend!

855
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,958
- [Owen yelps]
- [barking continues]

856
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,166
Oh, look at you little guys.
You guys are adorable from up here.

857
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,708
If only you were a wee bit taller.

858
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,791
- [branch snaps]
- [Owen] Ow! Why?

859
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,208
Five million's gonna
take us some time, Rehan.

860
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:34,583
Do I look like an unreasonable woman?

861
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,541
No. You have till end of week.

862
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:41,833
[grimacing] I'm sorry. Does that interfere
with your daughter's wedding?

863
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:44,458
Oh, shit!

864
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:47,208
Are you surprised that I am aware
that you have a daughter?

865
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:48,291
And she...

866
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,958
Let's hypothetically call her,
I don't know, Parker?

867
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:53,291
...is getting married on Saturday.

868
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:54,916
If you don't get me

869
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,250
my five million dollars
before the wedding, then Parker...

870
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:01,666
is marrying the Grim Reaper.

871
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,416
- Meaning she'll be killed.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it.

872
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,666
[Rehan] I know you got it, darling.

873
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,708
Did I mention I have a new shark tank?

874
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:15,833
Maybe your daughter
could test it out for me.

875
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,583
[Rehan chuckling]

876
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,875
Those fuckers are hungry.

877
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,166
- [growling quietly]
- Shh!

878
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,083
- [phone line ringing]
- Pick up, Parker!

879
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:29,375
- Parker, pick up!
- [automated voice] <i>Thank you for...</i>

880
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:30,625
- Son of a...
- [siren whoops]

881
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,666
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

882
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:35,291
Oh, God!

883
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,583
- Okay.
- [tense music playing]

884
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,083
Hey, officer, how can I help you?

885
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,958
License and masturbation, please.

886
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,291
- Okay, good morning.
- [laughing] You look like shit.

887
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,416
And that's coming from a guy

888
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,791
who uses his sock
as a filter for his coffee.

889
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:55,916
No, I'm doing great.

890
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,500
- Thanks for asking.
- Mmm.

891
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,666
There appears to be
a dog gnawing on your leg.

892
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,958
[growling]

893
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,416
Yeah, that's just my little buddy.
My little bud.

894
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,708
We just took a walk in the woods.

895
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:10,083
You know, it's funny,

896
00:44:10,875 --> 00:44:12,833
the Ghost Bandits knew precisely

897
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,000
how to circumvent
the security system in your bank.

898
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,750
And when I called SunRidge
to find out who designed the system,

899
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:22,333
you know what they said?

900
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,666
[scoffs] Are you insinuating
that I had something to do with it?

901
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,083
Do you mind popping the trunk?

902
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,541
- Pop the trunk.
- Okay, this is insane.

903
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,208
I'll say that. I mean, this is ridiculous.

904
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,500
I haven't committed a crime
in my entire life.

905
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,125
[Oldham] Uh-huh.

906
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,750
First time for everything!

907
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:42,500
- [metal door slams]
- [Oldham] Let's see.

908
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:44,375
We got a couple burner phones,

909
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,833
two boxes of nine mil, and...

910
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,625
[distorted]...voice modulator.

911
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:51,416
Someone put this stuff in my trunk.

912
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,833
[distorted] Who, Owen?
Who are you working with?

913
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:56,041
[growling]

914
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,958
- [distorted] Who, Owen?
- I...

915
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:00,416
I don't... I don't know.

916
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,083
Okay, look, I get it.
I forget things too sometimes.

917
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:10,416
So how about a nice, long weekend
in a jail cell to help jog your memory?

918
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,625
I'm...
I'm supposed to get married this weekend.

919
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:16,416
You know, I was married once,
to a beautiful woman named Sheryl.

920
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:20,000
- You know where she is now?
- Is she dead?

921
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:22,125
I wish.

922
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,916
No, she lives in Key West
with her new husband.

923
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,750
Former Navy SEAL.

924
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:31,625
Rock-hard abs,
and a cock you can land a 747 on.

925
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,958
That's a big plane.

926
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,750
It's a wide plane.

927
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:39,833
Anyway, I became so obsessed
with catching the Ghost Bandits

928
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,125
that it cost me my marriage.

929
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,208
Hmm?

930
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,583
My house.

931
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,125
Maybe even my sanity.

932
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:50,458
I mean, after a while,
I started wondering if the Ghost Bandits...

933
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,791
you know, were real ghosts.

934
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,666
Hey! Let's funnel this energy
into getting Sheryl back!

935
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,833
Right? I can make a photo montage.

936
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:05,958
Don't let this guy
with this giant cock win over you!

937
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,625
- [sighs] Lock him up.
- Wait, no! My wedding!

938
00:46:08,708 --> 00:46:10,583
Oh, you're gonna have a wedding,

939
00:46:10,666 --> 00:46:13,875
and quite the bachelor party
in D block this weekend.

940
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,125
It wasn't me.

941
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,333
It was my in-laws.

942
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:23,666
They robbed my bank,
and I did not help them.

943
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:24,750
They used me.

944
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,666
Damn, boy, you flip quick.

945
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:30,250
Prove it.
Put on a wire and get 'em to confess.

946
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:34,416
- You want me to be a rat?
- I want you to do the right thing, Owen.

947
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:38,916
Clear your name,
and help me catch the Ghost Bandits.

948
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:42,625
And also, yes, be a little bit of a rat.

949
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,333
[menacing music playing]

950
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
[whispers] Parker.

951
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,583
- [door closes]
- [whispers] Parker! Hey, Parker!

952
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,601
- [Parker] There you are! Where you been?
- We have to talk.

953
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:55,892
- Why are you pinching your chest?
- Because I'm wearing a...

954
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:59,083
[nervously] Whoa, gosh!
A... soft shirt! Whoa!

955
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,291
Feels like my fingers are at a finger spa.

956
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,375
- Really? Looks pretty starchy...
- Don't touch me!

957
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm sorry. It's just...

958
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,916
the in-laws aren't supposed
to touch the groom before the wedding.

959
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,166
- That's horseshit.
- Are you high right now, Owen?

960
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,500
I don't do illegal things,
unlike other people.

961
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,666
Other people do... illegal things,
and I'm cool with that too.

962
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,830
And if we want to talk about that
and just sort of get things off our chest...

963
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:25,083
Okay, uh, we gotta go,
'cause we gotta be at the bakery.

964
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,750
The bakery! Yep!

965
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,041
Okay, I think me and you
should just go to the bakery,

966
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,000
just because our baker died,
we gotta get a new cake.

967
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,375
Perhaps we should all just go together.
One big happy family.

968
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,000
You guys don't wanna run errands.

969
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:40,000
I do.

970
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,333
Of course we do.
Who doesn't like desserts?

971
00:47:42,416 --> 00:47:47,083
Well, they're vegan desserts,
and we all know that they taste like shit.

972
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:50,125
I'm sorry, Parker,
but I'm being honest with you.

973
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,583
They taste like shit, okay?

974
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:56,000
So you guys should stay,
we should go eat the shit. Come on.

975
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,750
[Parker on mic] <i>As long as we leave now.</i>

976
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,000
[Owen] <i>Oh, we're all going. Cool, good.
All right! Okay!</i>

977
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:06,750
[singsong] Okay! Oh, we're tasting cakes
at 1308 Grant Avenue!

978
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:09,083
You know, when I go on a trip,
I usually take two bags.

979
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:10,833
I have a carry-on, then I check one too.

980
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:13,291
- [on mic] <i>I check one, two.</i>
- Schmuck.

981
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:16,541
[Owen] <i>You're driving!
Billy McDermott is driving! Cool.</i>

982
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:20,833
<i>Hey, do you want to play
Never Have I Ever?</i>

983
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:24,000
<i>Never have I ever worn
a scary mask when it wasn't Halloween.</i>

984
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:25,125
<i>Now your turn.</i>

985
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:30,291
[Owen] <i>We have arrived.
I am one click south of the door.</i>

986
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,625
<i>You guys sure you don't wanna wait
in the car? No? Okay.</i>

987
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,166
<i>We are zero clicks from the door.</i>

988
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,458
<i>- I am opening the door.</i>
- [bell ringing]

989
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:40,416
- [Owen] Right this way, come on in.
- [Billy] Go ahead. Smells good.

990
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,958
Nice. Yep, that's cake.

991
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:45,791
Welcome to Vegan Divas.
Where you can get your cake...

992
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:49,083
- [door opens loudly]
- And eat it too! I'm Kay.

993
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:50,750
And this is my sister Ida.

994
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:55,250
She's the vegan and I'm the diva.

995
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:59,500
Thank you so much
for fitting us in last minute.

996
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:01,041
- Yep.
- Don't even worry about it.

997
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:04,416
I totally get last minute.
I'm never on time for anything.

998
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,666
Are you sure about this? [laughs]

999
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,710
[whispers] Our wedding
is at a very specific time.

1000
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,291
No, it's okay. The reviews were great.

1001
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,976
- This is just their shtick.
- [head bangs]

1002
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
[Billy] Oh!

1003
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,125
[Kay on mic] <i>Why do I keep doing that?</i>

1004
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,848
[Ida] <i>Hey, I think you might be bleeding.</i>

1005
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,267
- [Kay] <i>Ida!</i>
- [Ida] <i>Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

1006
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,125
- [Kay] <i>Cake! Hurry!</i>
- [Ida] <i>Okay.</i>

1007
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:25,416
So this is our Better-Than-Sex
red velvet cake

1008
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,041
that Ida makes from scratch.

1009
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,208
And that name is no lie.

1010
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,708
I've compared them both.

1011
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,125
Mmm! And this is vegan?

1012
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:34,166
Oh, yeah.

1013
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,250
Hmm.

1014
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,791
[softly] Parker, can I speak with you
in private real quick?

1015
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,375
What's wrong?

1016
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,125
- I like to concur...
- What? Sure.

1017
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:45,333
...about, you know, important life decisions
before we make them.

1018
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,208
- You know? Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

1019
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,976
- You have a little something here.
- What's that, sweetheart?

1020
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,833
What the fuck?

1021
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,416
I'm sorry!
I didn't know you guys were together!

1022
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,125
[laughs] Owen, what's going on?

1023
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:07,750
Okay, I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but the FBI thinks

1024
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,041
- I had something to do with the robbery.
- What?

1025
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,476
- They made me wear...
- [doors open]

1026
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,875
Oh! What a lovely little bakery.

1027
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:16,333
- You must be Parker!
- Hi.

1028
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,625
- [Parker yelps]
- [all clamoring]

1029
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:22,166
- [loudly] Ah! Nobody make a scene!
- You're the one with the gun, Rehan.

1030
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,708
Yes, you are the one with the gun
holding hostages right now...

1031
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:28,166
- [on mic] <i>...inside of the bakery.</i>
- [gags] Oh, hostages!

1032
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,083
- What the hell is going on?
- Listen, Rehan.

1033
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,875
- We told you we'd get you the money.
- Oh, yes. No, you did.

1034
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,708
But then I remembered you are liars.

1035
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,958
Just in case you were planning
on slithering away into the shadows again,

1036
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,916
I thought I'd come here for a little...

1037
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,666
- insurance.
- [Parker yelps]

1038
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,166
[laughing]

1039
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:51,875
- [Rehan] Come along, Parker.
- Hey, hey, hey! Just take me instead.

1040
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:52,958
Take me!

1041
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,916
You little Build-A-Bear?
You think you're hostage material?

1042
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,708
No one here gives two shits
whether you live or die!

1043
00:50:58,791 --> 00:51:01,708
Look at them and check in with them.

1044
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,250
Oh! Zero shits given.

1045
00:51:04,833 --> 00:51:07,166
I don't understand. Was Owen right?

1046
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,875
Just do what she says.

1047
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,958
Stay calm, baby. Just stay calm.

1048
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:15,166
So emo! Getting choked up.

1049
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,666
- Dad? Dad?
- I like getting choked, though.

1050
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,041
You can eat my cake anytime!

1051
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:23,916
Please, God, save my fiancée who is
exiting the back of the bakery right now.

1052
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,958
FBI! Freeze!

1053
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,375
God'll save you, Parker!

1054
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,875
[dramatic music playing]

1055
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:33,000
[music building and stops]

1056
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:40,041
[whining loudly] Please!
God, please! Please! Please, God!

1057
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,166
- [epic music playing]
- [guns firing]

1058
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,458
Ahh! Oh! Oh, shit!

1059
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,791
- [all clamoring]
- [gunfire continues]

1060
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:56,958
Come on, Roger! You got this, Roger!
Be a man, you dickhead!

1061
00:51:57,041 --> 00:52:00,166
- [glass shattering]
- [gunfire continues]

1062
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,458
Ahh! Ahh!

1063
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:08,166
[gunfire continues]

1064
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:21,916
[exclaiming]

1065
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,833
- [whining]
- [gunfire continues]

1066
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:30,583
[both shrieking]

1067
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,791
- [shrieking continues on mic]
- God, man!

1068
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,666
- [Parker] Fuck you!
- [Rehan] Go on, take her!

1069
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,458
Get the fuck in! Get in the car!

1070
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,708
[epic music continues]

1071
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:44,625
I'm going after her.

1072
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,083
What the fuck? Oh, son of a bitch.

1073
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,375
Everything's fucking cake in here!

1074
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,375
I'm going after her!

1075
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:55,041
No! You're gonna get yourself killed!
Get down! Get down!

1076
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:03,166
You're really fuckin' getting on my tits!

1077
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,041
- [music building]
- [shrieking]

1078
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,166
- [music stops]
- Shut up!

1079
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,833
Lilly! Lilly, the front!

1080
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:14,750
Let's go.

1081
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,750
[dramatic music playing]

1082
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,750
Go for the tires.

1083
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:24,958
[Rehan] Get me my fucking money!

1084
00:53:25,958 --> 00:53:27,166
Ah, shit.

1085
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,208
I fucking love this job!

1086
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,583
- [loud bang]
- [Rehan] Motherfuckers!

1087
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,666
[Oldham] Freeze!

1088
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:34,458
[Billy] What?

1089
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:35,875
Put your guns down.

1090
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,000
Put 'em down now.

1091
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,500
- They got our daughter.
- Don't move!

1092
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:43,458
[screaming]

1093
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,333
- [Billy] Motherfucker!
- [groaning]

1094
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,166
You! You were supposed to protect her!

1095
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,583
This is why people
don't trust the federal government.

1096
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,625
This is on you! Hey! Hey!

1097
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,625
Let me in! Hey, let me in!

1098
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:04,625
No, no, no, no, no!

1099
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,916
Let me in! Let me in!

1100
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,541
- Okay, I committed. [grunting]
- [engine revving]

1101
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,333
[Owen screaming faintly]

1102
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:20,958
[Owen screaming loudly]

1103
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,333
What happened?

1104
00:54:24,291 --> 00:54:25,833
[grunting] Ahh!

1105
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,541
- [Billy] Oh, Jesus.
- [Owen] Ow!

1106
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,541
[Billy] Come on, get your ass out here.
There you go.

1107
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,583
Ahh! Why are we stopped?
We gotta go after her!

1108
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:37,958
- I know where that woman lives!
- Rehan has houses everywhere.

1109
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:39,625
We have no idea where she took Parker.

1110
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,666
[Billy] Even if you did,
what were you gonna do?

1111
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,916
Sneak into the bushes

1112
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,375
and get chased up a tree
by a pack of tiny dogs?

1113
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:47,500
Parker is in the wind.

1114
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:50,291
- I'm sorry.
- Well, what are we gonna do now?

1115
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:53,416
The first thing we're gonna do is
you're gonna take that fucking wire off.

1116
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,708
[Billy] You little shit bag.

1117
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,541
I knew you were a coward
but I didn't take you to be a rat.

1118
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,041
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna take the fall for you guys!

1119
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,541
We never asked you to.

1120
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,750
No! You just framed me!

1121
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,833
You put bank-robbing evidence
in the trunk of my car!

1122
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,845
He wouldn't have
been convicted of anything!

1123
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,583
It was just enough to tie him up

1124
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:14,750
and save Parker from making
the biggest mistake of her life.

1125
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,666
[yelling] She just got kidnapped
because of you!

1126
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:23,125
Before you came back in her life,
the worst thing that happened to Parker?

1127
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:26,166
She burned the roof of her mouth
on a home-made flatbread.

1128
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:29,291
I would've blown on it, but I couldn't.
I had a cold.

1129
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:33,333
How could you guys
possibly know what she wants?

1130
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:35,208
Or needs? You weren't there!

1131
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,125
Because we were trying
to fucking protect her, that's why!

1132
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:39,625
Rehan used to be our partner.

1133
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:41,508
She would choose the bank
and clean the money.

1134
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:43,333
And then she started to fuckin' lose it!

1135
00:55:43,416 --> 00:55:46,041
We were afraid
she would find out about Parker.

1136
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,750
So on the last job,
we just took the money and ran.

1137
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:51,166
I don't give a shit.
I don't care what happened, okay?

1138
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:54,583
- I just care about getting Parker back.
- Oh, yeah, you and me both.

1139
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:01,291
You need five million in two days.
So you're gonna rob another bank, right?

1140
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,708
Wouldn't hurt to have
a bank manager on the team.

1141
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:10,500
Someone who knows the bank's weaknesses,
which ones have excess cash holdings,

1142
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,500
when and where they move that cash.

1143
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:15,916
He gets nervous cracking an egg.
You think he can rob a bank?

1144
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,541
If it's to save Parker?
Fuck yeah, I'll rob a bank!

1145
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:24,041
[sighs softly]

1146
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,625
We always knew they were criminals.

1147
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,083
[whispers] They drink during the day.

1148
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:33,416
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, and the daughter...
is a yoga instructor.

1149
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,333
I'm not saying anything,
but, you know, connect the dots.

1150
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:37,416
[Oldham] Mmm.

1151
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:40,250
Do you have any idea
where they might've gone?

1152
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:41,333
[Neil] Mmm-mmm.

1153
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:45,041
Does Owen have any access
to a family cabin or anything like that?

1154
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,000
A, um, a vacation home...

1155
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,375
Vacation home? What, are you kidding me?

1156
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,833
Who do we look like, The Jeffersons?

1157
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,083
[sighs heavily]

1158
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:57,666
Here's a list of all the banks
within a 100-mile radius,

1159
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:02,041
arranged by on-site cash holdings,
from ValueBank all the way up to...

1160
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,500
Atlas Reserve, 20 million dollars.

1161
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,833
- One-stop shopping.
- Hmm! Easy.

1162
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,458
[laughing] Yeah, I wish!

1163
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:09,375
- [Billy] No?
- No.

1164
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,083
We can't rob Atlas Reserve.

1165
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,541
Phoebe King has that place on lock.

1166
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:14,708
Who's Phoebe King?

1167
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:18,250
I thought you guys were the Ghost Bandits.
You don't know who Phoebe King is?

1168
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:22,166
<i>- She pioneered bandit barriers.</i>
- [upbeat music playing]

1169
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:25,416
[Owen] <i>Every inch of her bank
is triple secured.</i>

1170
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,833
I'd fuck me.

1171
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,083
And her vault?

1172
00:57:28,166 --> 00:57:31,500
<i>I'm talking biometrics,
weight sensitivity,</i>

1173
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:34,166
not to mention randomized time locks!

1174
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,583
[laughing] Okay?

1175
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,541
When did you make this?

1176
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,226
When I walked to the vending machine,
got a Diet Squirt.

1177
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,041
Weirdly, I had a lot of it in my pockets.

1178
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,285
So, let me get this straight.

1179
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,458
You made a model
of a bank we're not gonna rob?

1180
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,541
Oh, wow. There's another one.
He made two.

1181
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,625
I made 12. Only two are presentable.

1182
00:57:51,708 --> 00:57:53,375
See, we don't want a Phoebe King.

1183
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:57,000
What we need is Victory Union,
a bank whose manager is lazy.

1184
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,125
A total turd.

1185
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:03,583
- What we need is a Vince Millen.
- [upbeat music continues]

1186
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,583
Vince lost his right testicle because,
one time,

1187
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,875
he sat on his nuts too hard.

1188
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,333
[screaming]

1189
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,892
[Owen] <i>The reason he got hired
is 'cause his dad owns the bank.</i>

1190
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:13,916
[man] Okay.

1191
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,666
[Owen] <i>The most important thing
about Vince is that he cuts corners.</i>

1192
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,083
Federal regulations limit

1193
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:23,208
how much cash a branch can hold
for security and insurance purposes.

1194
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,750
<i>When you go over the limit,</i>

1195
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,625
<i>a manager has to arrange
for a cash pick-up from the vault.</i>

1196
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,458
[Vince] Yo, lock up for me.
I got paintball.

1197
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:34,541
Now, the armored truck is supposed to
take the cash directly to the repository,

1198
00:58:34,625 --> 00:58:36,666
but Vince hates paperwork.

1199
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,166
So he has the same armored truck

1200
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,875
collect cash
from all three branches he manages

1201
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,208
before going to the repository.

1202
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:48,958
So if we hit that truck
after the pickup from the third branch...

1203
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:51,625
- It's like robbing three banks in one.
- [Owen claps]

1204
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,541
- We just need disguises.
- [Owen] Yep.

1205
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:54,708
And I need a gun.

1206
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:57,875
- What? Oh, my gosh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1207
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:59,583
Whoa!

1208
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:00,583
[laughs]

1209
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,833
- It's way lighter than I thought it'd be.
- It's a water gun.

1210
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,583
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

1211
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:08,916
Do I still look cool?

1212
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,875
Yeah, you look like James Bond.

1213
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:13,000
Which one?

1214
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,083
- Five.
- Oh, that was a good one.

1215
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:17,333
[expectant music playing]

1216
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,833
[expectant music continues]

1217
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,333
- [gun firing]
- [crowd shrieking]

1218
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,958
Everybody on the ground, now!

1219
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,625
- Don't be a hero!
- [vault door opens]

1220
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,000
Hey, Donkey!

1221
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:23,750
[groaning]

1222
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,291
Oh, God! That was really violent!

1223
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:29,458
How'd you like my accent?
Did it sound Irish or Scottish?

1224
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:32,166
It was supposed to sound Scottish
but I think it came out Irish.

1225
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,250
Don't tell Billy.

1226
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,250
[Lilly] Focus! We're robbing a bank here.

1227
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:38,625
And remember, you're in charge.

1228
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,541
[dramatic music playing]

1229
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:44,208
That's right! I'm in charge, okay?

1230
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:45,958
So no one try to be a hero.

1231
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,000
I will cap a motherfucker!

1232
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,916
I will cap your ass!

1233
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,958
[dramatic music continues]

1234
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,000
Everybody, stay down, all right?

1235
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,791
You guys like <i>Shrek?</i>
Who's your favorite character?

1236
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,125
Mine's Shrek.

1237
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:13,041
What are you doing? Don't get up.
Do not get up!

1238
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,208
[nervously] Okay, and you did.
But stay right there, all right?

1239
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:20,083
Do not come towards me.
Do not come tow... Don't rush towards me!

1242

Easy breezy.

1244

- [man yelling]
- [crowd gasps]

1246

What the fuck?

1247
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:48,583
Freeze!

1248
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:51,083
Nice and easy, boy-o. I gotcha.

1249
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,583
[groaning]

1250
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,666
Put the gun down. Put it down.

1251
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,000
That's very good.

[tense music playing]

1264
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:51,583
[Lilly] Come on, kid,
where the fuck are you?

1265

[Billy] About time, Shrek.

1269
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,708
Sorry, a big guy that looked like
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's character

1270
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:14,791
from <i>Moana</i> had a heart attack,
so I had to give him CPR.

1271
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:15,958
How's your part going?

1272
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,875
- [Lilly] Three against two. Drop 'em.
- [guard] What do we do?

1273
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:20,625
- I don't know.
- You drop 'em.

1274
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,916
Can we hurry up?
[yells] Can we hurry this up?

1275
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,500
Okay, all right, just put 'em down.

1276
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:34,583
Easy down now.

1277

[water dripping]

1278
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,500
What the fuck?

All right, yeah! We're doing this.

You know, I always wanted
to be a school bus driver.

The money!

1295
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,625
The money, the money!

1296
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,416
Oh, no, no, no. That's not good.

kick your green ass, Shrek!

mourn during this time...

was buried in here.

01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,125
- Oh, shit!
- [alarm chiming]

1324
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,642
- [Owen] God.
- What the fuck is that?

1325
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:51,250
My Go-Gurts! Snack time.
Gotta keep the blood sugar up.

1326
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:53,309
- [Lilly] Give me that.
- You want to pick a flavor?

1327
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,458
- [Lilly] Fucking Go-Gurts!
- [Billy] Snack time!

1328
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,541
- [officer] Shit!
- [exclaiming]

1329
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,083
[rock music fading]

1330
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,708
[Billy] Oh, shit.

1331
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,333
[sighs]

1332
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,208
[Owen] How much did we clear?

1333
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,500
Sixty bucks.

1334
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,083
Sixty bucks.

1335
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:25,583
Okay, that's a building block.

1336
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,416
[upbeat music fading in]

1337
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,000
[upbeat music playing]

1338
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,625
I'm sorry. What the fuck is this?

1339
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:47,958
You don't know him? This is Babayan.

1340
01:07:48,041 --> 01:07:52,000
He's like the Kanye
of the former Soviet Bloc.

1341
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,083
Is the Kanye here?

1342
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,458
Shut the fuck up and dance!

1343
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:59,833
Do my parents rob banks?

1344
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:01,458
Do I have a magical pussy?

1345
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,541
The answer is yes.

1346
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:07,166
Your parents,
they are magnificent bank robbers.

1347
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,833
I mean, when they disappeared, I felt...

1348
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:11,666
betrayed.

1349
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:14,291
[Rehan] You try to run?

1350
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,041
Ahh!

1351
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,458
[Rehan] Stupid bitch.

1352
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,958
Now, pay attention.

1353
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:22,250
Babayan is about to do his grand finale.

1354
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:25,208
- [upbeat music continues]
- [Rehan] Hoorah, Babayan!

1355
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:27,916
Hoorah, Babayan!

1356
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:35,958
- [explosion]
- [Owen exclaiming]

1357
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:39,250
I think I left my phone in there.

1358
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,458
Okay, guess Uber's out of the question.

1359
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,166
CPR?

1360
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:48,000
You stopped to give someone CPR?

1361
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:51,000
- My training kicked in.
- You foolish gobshite!

1362
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:55,125
Okay, stop it! We have less
than 24 hours to get that money.

1363
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,958
Oh, forget about the money.

1364
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,708
We need to rescue Parker first,
then leave the country.

1365
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:02,125
We are not running this time.

1366
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:04,458
Parker made a real life for herself here.

1367
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:07,750
- It's what's best for her.
- No, that's what's best for us.

1368
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:12,875
I... I have an idea.

1369
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,083
We could rob Atlas Reserve.

1370
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:20,791
What happened to,
"One does not rob Phoebe King?"

1371
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,625
One doesn't, but maybe three does?

1372
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:27,750
I don't know. I just... I know a way in.

1373
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,875
I just don't know we could get out
once the police show up.

1374
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,458
Well, maybe we can
get a little help there.

1375
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:38,166
Ghost Bandits on three.

1376
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,250
Three...

1377
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:43,416
Okay, that was gonna be a cool moment.
Hey, guys, wait up!

1378
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,958
<i>Earlier today, a man dressed
as the popular animated character Shrek</i>

1379
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:53,625
<i>attempted to rob Victory Union Bank,
but he soon discovered that it's not so...</i>

1380
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:58,125
That's 100% Owen in a Shrek costume.
I could recognize his giant ass anywhere.

1381
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,125
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

1382
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,375
Damn, he's going nuts.

1383
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,041
Why is he on TV?

1384
01:10:03,125 --> 01:10:04,625
I'm gonna call him again.

1385
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,250
[phone ringing]

1386
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,541
- Hello?
- It's Billy.

1387
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:09,708
Oh, it's Billy.

1388
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,708
- Okay...
- You listen to me.

1389
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,541
You touch one single hair
on my son's back, and I swear to God...

1390
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:17,458
Shut up and listen,
I'm not gonna touch your son's back hair.

1391
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,541
But I am gonna use him to rob a bank.

1392
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:23,166
If you don't want to see him go to prison,
we're gonna need getaway drivers.

1393
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:26,708
Wait, hold on!
You want us to be getaway drivers?

1394
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:29,375
So be at Owen's bank tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

1395
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,791
- And keep the engine running!
- [whispers] Let me talk! Let me talk!

1396
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:36,083
[crying] Mom? Dad?
I'm so scared! I'm so scared! Please...

1397
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,958
Please, if you love me at all,

1398
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:40,791
don't tell Agent Oldham
at the FBI anything.

1399
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,625
Honey, I swear.

1400
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,416
We will tell no one!

1401
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,041
No one!

1402
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:48,000
[intriguing music playing]

1403
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,750
- What time did they say?
- 10:00 a.m.

1404
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,333
Why does your clock say 8:00?

1405
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:01,500
Oh, I took a business trip
to Phoenix once, I never changed it back.

1406
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,166
Something's not right here.

1407
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,208
[suspenseful music playing]

1408
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,166
[Owen] Good. Coast is clear.

1409
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:16,375
Told you they wouldn't
be an accessory to a crime.

1410
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,333
Owen, you better take this.

1411
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:22,416
Whoa, heft.

1412
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,833
That's not tap water. It's lead.

1413
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:27,208
Do not under any circumstances...

1414
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:28,291
Oh, Jesus.

1415
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,208
Do not pull the trigger.

1416
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
[exhales heavily]

1417
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:36,250
All right. Game time.

1418
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:38,791
Await my signal.

1419
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:45,500
Just think of how many
terrible decisions we had to make

1420
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,250
to get to this moment in time,

1421
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,291
with everything riding
on this pasty little goober.

1422
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,416
We're so fucked.

1423
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,416
Yeah, well, this pasty little goober

1424
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,458
is about to rob his second bank
for our daughter.

1425
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I like him.

1426
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:05,333
[Owen] I'm sorry,
but I don't know what I'm doing.

1427
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:08,416
My bank got robbed
and I didn't do anything to stop it.

1428
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,208
I suck! I suck so bad!

1429
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,666
First off, stop crying.

1430
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,500
Whenever I hear babies cry, I lactate.

1431
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:17,875
Can't ruin another suit.

1432
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,333
Look, I need your help.

1433
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:23,392
Can you show me your vault so I can see
what a real security system looks like?

1434
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,958
- So you want to see inside my vault?
- Yeah.

1435
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:29,083
Remember when I told you a Butterball
turkey could break into your vault?

1436
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:31,375
- Yeah, I remember.
- Make that sound.

1437
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:35,125
If I do, would you let me into the vault?

1438
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,291
Do it!
[imitates turkey gobbling] Come on!

1439
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,392
- [imitates gobbling]
- With your throat.

1440
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,666
- [both gobbling]
- Louder.

1441
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,291
- [gobbling loudly]
- There you go.

1442
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:47,416
[gobbling continues muted]

1443
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:51,458
Let's go.

1444
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:53,916
[suspenseful music playing]

1445
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,333
[Owen] Wow!

1446
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,041
- Pretty heavy duty.
- [Phoebe] Yeah, you like that, huh?

1447
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:04,083
[giggles] It's a decoy!

1448
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:07,125
I'm not gonna have a safe this pathetic.
What am I, you?

1449
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:11,708
[mockingly] "I'll just put one big circle
on the front and that's what locks it."

1450
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:12,791
Freak.

1451
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,041
- Don't look.
- Okay.

1452
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,416
[keypad beeping]

1453
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:22,166
The last numbers are irrelevant.
That's how I masturbate.

1454
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,916
[keypad beeping]

1455
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,791
[snorts]

1456
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:28,916
That feels good.

1457
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
- [lock whirring]
- [joyous classical music playing]

1458
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,083
[softly] Phoebe King.

1459
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:45,208
You know it, bitch.

1460
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,458
Is that...

1461
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,583
Triple-enforced titanium with digital,
manual, and combination locks?

1462
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,250
Pussy.

1463
01:13:59,125 --> 01:14:01,000
Don't tell me
when I can take a fuckin' break.

1464
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,833
I take a break
when I fuckin' feel like it.

1465
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:06,208
[laughs] Shit! You know what I mean?
I don't care if it ain't...

1466
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:11,625
That Owen's parents?
The fuck are they doing at the job?

1467
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:14,458
Mr. and Mrs. Browning!
What's going on with y'all?

1468
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:16,000
[laughing] How y'all doing?

1469
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,416
Why y'all look like that?
Y'all look real stiff and kinda paranoid.

1470
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,458
Real statuesque, like you...
you in a wax museum or something.

1471
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,541
[chuckling]

1472
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:27,101
- Hey, is that a cop in your backseat?
- [Oldham] I'm not a cop.

1473
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:30,500
I'm an agent.
And could you please keep your voice down?

1474
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,708
First of all,
what's the fuckin' difference, okay?

1475
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:35,125
You don't run nothing here!
This ain't your jurisdiction!

1476
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:37,500
- [whispers] Tyree! Tyree! Shh!
- What?

1477
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:40,583
Don't tell anybody,
but your bank's about to be robbed.

1478
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:43,541
What do you mean, don't tell nobody?
They about to rob the bank again?

1479
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:45,105
- Shh!
- [yelling] What the fuck, man?

1480
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:48,125
Damn it! Man, I haven't even...
I left some shit in the microwave!

1481
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,166
- Shh!
- Fuck! I haven't even taken my lunch yet!

1482
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,416
No, you don't shush me!

1483
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,125
- Fuck this! I'm out.
- [Oldham] Ugh!

1484
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:56,125
- [Tyree yells in distance] Fuck! The fuck...
- Why did you say that?

1485
01:14:56,208 --> 01:15:00,041
- I told you not to say anything.
- [Tyree faintly] This job fucking sucks!

1486
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:02,750
[softly] Just like Owen
told you not to say anything.

1487
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,208
It's a setup! It's a setup!
They're going after a different bank!

1488
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:11,291
- [Oldham groans]
- [thrilling music playing]

1489
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:14,125
- [grunts] Get out, I'm taking the car.
- Not a chance.

1490
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:17,208
It's taken me years
to get this seat exactly the way I like.

1491
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:18,458
Oh, God!

1492
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,583
God damn it!

1493
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:24,833
- Where to?
- Atlas Reserve! They're desperate.

1494
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:27,583
- [thrilling music stops suddenly]
- [Oldham] Come on! Come on!

1495
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:32,333
Little faster, please?

1496
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:35,541
- [intriguing music playing]
- [keypad beeping]

1497
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,625
And now for the money shot.

1498
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:42,083
Synchronized manual locks.

1499
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,041
Ah! Ah! Tss! Oh!

1500
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Yeah.

1501
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:50,500
[hooting wildly]

1502
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:54,708
[car alarm chirps]

1503
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:57,625
- It's not the most discreet signal.
- [chirping continues]

1504
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:01,250
- [chirping continues]
- Jesus, Owen, we got it.

1505
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:04,166
Shut the fuck up! If this kid
makes it out alive, I'm gonna kill him.

1506
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,010
- [car alarm wailing]
- [Billy] Fuckin' hell!

1507
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:09,875
Three, two, one, and release.

1508
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,500
[moans]

1509
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,500
[grunting exaggeratedly]

1510
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:23,750
[grunting exaggeratedly]

1511
01:16:25,041 --> 01:16:29,583
[grunting extremely loudly]

1512
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:31,208
- [vault door hissing]
- Pull.

1513
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:33,666
[thrilling music playing]

1514

- [bystanders clamoring]
- [guards groaning]

1515
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,000
[Billy] This is a robbery!

1516
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:46,333
- Everyone on the ground now!
- [people screaming]

1517
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:48,666
What the fuck is that? Oop!

1518
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,250
I'm sorry! I'm a coward!

1519
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:54,708
I suck at bank managing!
I can't believe I pulled it off.

1520
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,791
[Phoebe muted] Owen, you fucking coward!

1521
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,791
[Phoebe gobbling]

1522
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,000
[Phoebe] Great, now I'm lactating.

1523
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,083
[thrilling music continues]

1524
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:04,625
Yes! Yes!

1525
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,458
- [gun firing]
- [people screaming]

1526
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,125
[thrilling music continues]

1527
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,208
- [Lilly yells]
- [guard groans]

1528
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:18,708
[people shrieking]

1529
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:22,083
I'm coming for you, Parker.

1530
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
Nope! That didn't go as planned.

1531
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,625
[thrilling music continues]

1532
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,458
Oh, my God.

1533
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:40,875
Oh, my God.

1534
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:43,000
[shrieking]

1535
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,750
- No! No!
- [Billy] Come on, sunshine, out you get.

1536
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:48,833
[dispatch on radio] <i>All units, we received
an alarm from Atlas Reserve Bank.</i>

1537
01:17:48,875 --> 01:17:51,416
<i>- Robbery in progress.</i>
- I knew it. Let's go, Neil, faster.

1538
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,750
- I drive smart, I don't drive fast.
- [angrily] At least do the speed limit!

1539
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:56,666
Your son's life depends on it!

1540
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,833
- [Margie] Faster!
- All right! All right, here goes!

1541
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:00,291
With your permission?

1542
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,541
[engine revving]

1543
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,875
- [both shrieking]
- [tires squealing]

1544
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:11,500
You're kind of reminding me
of Dan Marino right now.

1545
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:13,041
Dan Marino?

1546
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,625
I met him at an orgy once.

1547
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,625
Ha! You think his arm was big? Whoa!

1548
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,291
I wouldn't know. I was in the car.

1549
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:27,541
All right, emergency escape latch.
Every vault has one.

1550
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,333
[vault door hissing]

1551
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:33,083
How can Gary never find this?

1552
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,166
[tense music playing]

1553
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,625
[siren whoops]

1554
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:49,416
[on loudspeaker] Hey, cuz, did somebody
order a bank robbery getaway driver?

1555
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,416
[imitates siren] Yo! Hey, what up?

1556
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,125
- How'd the robbery go?
- Shut up!

1557
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:57,875
Yo, man, I got morphine in the back
if you want to do a little drip...

1558
01:18:57,958 --> 01:19:00,166
- Let's go, come on!
- Yeah, let's go!

1559
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,166
- [yelling] Drive!
- Yeah, of course.

1560
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,500
- [bystanders screaming]
- [tense music continues]

1561
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:11,208
- [Oldham yelps]
- [intriguing music playing]

1562
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:22,791
- [parents] Was that them?
- Get out! Get in the back, I'm driving!

1563
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:24,458
You know what? I get sick in the back.

1564
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:26,291
Margie,
would you mind gettin' in the back?

1565
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,625
No! I don't want to get in the back.
It smells like eggs.

1566
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,000
[yelling] Come on, let's go!

1567
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:31,750
- [Neil] All right!
- Okay, I'm going.

1568
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,666
- Fine. All right.
- [Neil] Here we go. Okay.

1569
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:37,708
You know what? If you just get out
and walk around, it's faster!

1570
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:39,416
[Neil] No, no, no! It's easier this way.

1571
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,208
- No!
- [Neil] I'm moving. I'm in too deep.

1572
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,333
I made the commitment.

1573
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:45,875
Just... Okay, all units,
suspects fleeing northbound on Elm.

1574
01:19:45,958 --> 01:19:47,833
All right, come on, go, go, go!

1575
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:49,666
[tires squealing]

1576
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,416
[Neil] Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!

1577
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,750
[rock music playing]

1578
01:19:57,958 --> 01:20:00,358
[Rehan] This is the first time
I've seen you look attractive.

1579
01:20:00,416 --> 01:20:04,416
This is the dress that I was going to wear
when your father finally came around.

1580
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,375
It's sexy. It's tasteful.

1581
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,833
I look like a meth-head lottery winner

1582
01:20:09,916 --> 01:20:12,708
marrying Machine Gun Kelly
at a cruise boat casino.

1583
01:20:12,791 --> 01:20:15,083
I love Machine Gun Kelly.

1584
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,708
He has that skinny dick energy.

1585
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:18,791
[siren whooping]

1586
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:21,458
[Owen on loudspeaker]
Hey, we got that cash delivery!

1587
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:23,541
Bitches!

1588
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:27,041
Finally. Interesting choice of vehicle.

1589
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,750
Don't forget to give me five stars.

1590
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:31,833
[laughing]

1591
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:32,791
Uber?

1592
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:35,916
[tense music playing]

1593
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:46,666
It's okay.

1594
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,458
[Owen grunts]

1595
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,333
It's all right there. Five million.

1596
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,125
Where are Billy and Lilly?

1597
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:58,875
They're off distracting the police.

1598
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:01,875
[siren whooping]

1599
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,892
- [siren continues]
- Aw, shit. It's not the volume. Sorry.

1600
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:06,958
- [siren stops]
- Sorry! Just... Sorry, my bad.

1601
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:11,708
Parker! What's up? It's RJ.
Remember Roy's Teppanyaki?

1602
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:13,000
- [RJ laughs]
- Wow.

1603
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:16,291
Owen... you did it!

1604
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:19,125
Bravo! Very well done!

1605
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:20,875
Well, look.

1606
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:24,375
My debt is paid, you're free to go.

1607
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,125
I think we should just
split this money 50/50,

1608
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,541
as a wedding present.

1609
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:32,416
I'm joking! I'm going to
kill the shit out of both of you.

1610
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,833
Nope! Freeze, all right?
Stay right where you are!

1611
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:36,833
[Rehan laughing]

1612
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:37,916
I got you now!

1613
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:39,500
Let her go.

1614
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:42,500
Oh, Owen, you're so sweet!
Put that gun down, you man-child.

1615
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:44,375
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1616
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:48,291
Did they give me
a fuckin' water gun again?

1617
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:49,708
[Rehan yelps]

1618
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,666
- [Owen] Oh!
- [Parker shrieks]

1619
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,375
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fucking shit!

1620
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:59,666
[RJ muted] Whoa!
My cuz is a straight-up murderer!

1621
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:02,916
Oh! Oh, God! Parker.

1622
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,267
- Owen, are you okay?
- Parker, Parker, Parker! Oh, my God.

1623
01:22:05,291 --> 01:22:07,166
- [Parker exclaims]
- Parker! Are you okay?

1624
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:08,970
- [Parker] Yeah.
- Are you okay? Oh, my God.

1625
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:14,083
- Oh, you...
- [car approaching]

1626
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,875
- My God, what happened?
- [Owen] I don't know.

1627
01:22:20,958 --> 01:22:23,333
I got sweat on my gun
so I thought it was a squirt gun.

1628
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,416
- It wasn't. It was a bullet gun.
- What?

1629
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,041
What the fuck? You guys are bank robbers?
You've been lying to me my entire life?

1630
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:32,250
We're trying to protect you, baby.
That's why we don't see you.

1631
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:35,000
- We're trying to keep you safe.
- And what about Owen, huh?

1632
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,333
You dragged him into it.
What if he'd gotten killed?

1633
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:40,000
You... You couldn't
have held him back if you tried.

1634
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:41,083
Really?

1635
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:44,541
You're the most important person
in the world to me, so...

1636
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:45,708
[Billy clears throat]

1637
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:51,041
He's a top man, he... he did really well.

1638
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,125
I've...

1639
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:54,125
I've grown fond of you.

1640
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,333
You did good.

1641
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:57,125
Here you go.

1642
01:22:58,375 --> 01:23:00,583
Nah, put that hand away.

1643
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:02,125
- We're family.
- What?

1644
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:04,166
- [Billy squealing] Hey!
- [Lilly] Oh!

1645
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,541
- I didn't use tongue.
- I did.

1646
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,476
- [sirens wailing]
- Uh-oh. Here we go, showtime.

1647
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,958
We dragged every cop in the city here.
Go on, skedaddle.

1648
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:13,208
You don't want to be in jail
on your wedding day.

1649
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:14,708
- Move it.
- [Owen] Love you.

1650
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,291
- [RJ] Ow!
