00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,277
[police radio chatter]

4
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,097
[man] Gentlemen!
Lock and load!

5
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:49,566
[police radio chatter]

6
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,842
[man] Connie Kaminski, you're under arrest.
Show me your hands. Show 'em!

7
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:01,110
[Connie] <i>Yep, that's me.
Connie Kaminski.</i>

8
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,579
[chuckling]
<i>And holy shit, that was scary.</i>

9
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,748
<i>I mean, I almost wet the bed.
I don't know why they didn't just knock.</i>

10
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,819
<i>I mean, this is a story about coupons.
Little old coupons. They j...</i>

11
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:13,189
<i>You know what? I should probably
start from the beginning.</i>

12
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,559
<i>Hiya. Me again.</i>

13
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:19,229
<i>Okay, yeah. This is
the perfect place to start.</i>

14
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,400
<i>Here's a fun fact:</i>

15
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:27,537
<i>I'm a three-time gold-medal-winning
Olympic racewalker.</i>

16
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:30,406
<i>And you know what that's worth
out in the real world?</i>

17
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:32,876
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

18
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:35,745
<i>Did you know most Olympic
athletes aren't famous?</i>

19
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:37,881
<i>And they sure as heck
aren't rich.</i>

20
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:42,185
<i>Go ahead, look it up.
I mean, not now, but, you know, later.</i>

21
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:45,555
<i>And, yeah, I may have retired,
but I don't quit.</i>

22
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,825
<i>I figure no matter what you
do, give it all you got.</i>

23
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,095
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola,</i> Mrs. Flores.

24
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,163
Do you have my coupons?

25
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,665
[speaking Spanish]

26
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:00,837
Oh. Super-duper.

27
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:05,942
Hey.

28
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,386
- [speaking Spanish]
- You know what,

29
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:19,289
you can never have
too much toilet paper, right?

30
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,291
- [chuckling]
- Okay, enjoy.

31
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:28,665
You might wanna pack a jacket.
The weather showed rain in Cleveland.

32
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:33,436
Oh, um, hey, did I just see you giving
the paper lady a bunch of stuff for free?

33
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,538
Rick, she's barely getting by.

34
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:37,941
Yeah, but at least
she has a job.

35
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,577
And you are spending money
that we don't have.

36
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:43,780
I am not spending money.
I am saving us money.

37
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:45,648
- [Connie] <i>This is my husband Rick.</i>
- You literally are.

38
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:47,984
<i>He works for the IRS.</i>

39
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,420
<i>And his job is to look
for people's mistakes.</i>

40
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:51,588
I'll get it.

41
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:53,389
What's this? Is this new?

42
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:55,959
There's, like,
50 jugs of Tide.

43
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,226
- [Rick sighs]
- [Connie] It's couponing 101.

44
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:02,231
When Tide hits a six-month stock-up
price, you stock up, okay?

45
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:06,336
That's 400 dollars' worth of
detergent that I got for $57.

46
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,338
My mom used coupons...

47
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,607
[Connie] <i>We didn't always
argue about money.</i>

48
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:13,343
<i>It was only after we tried
to start a family.</i>

49
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:16,679
<i>And we tried.
And we tried.</i> [sighs]

50
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:18,615
<i>And we tried.</i>

51
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,818
<i>And then, it finally happened.</i>

52
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,288
<i>We were going to have a girl.</i>

53
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,858
<i>But I just couldn't get
to the finish line.</i>

54
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:35,732
<i>After that, for a while we
didn't argue about anything.</i>

55
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,968
<i>Then Rick discovered
he could travel more for work.</i>

56
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,904
<i>Now he's gone three weeks
out of every month.</i>

57
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,406
<i>But that's okay.</i>

58
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>'Cause if that didn't happen,</i>

59
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,443
<i>I might not have met
my best friend, JoJo.</i>

60
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,381
Yo, yo, yo!
It's time to save with JoJo.

61
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,884
Here is the thing
I love about coupons.

62
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,354
I control my time,
I control my income,

63
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,056
I control my life.

64
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,659
So, JoJo's deal of the week
is right here...

65
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,895
You sure as shit doing a good
job controlling your income.

66
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,731
- Mom.
- [chuckles] 'Cause you ain't got no money.

67
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,900
Stop. Mama, no. Stop it!

68
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:13,936
You know I'm just... I'm over
here busy trying to build my brand

69
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,972
as a successful entrepreneur.

70
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,474
[chuckles] I'm my own CEO.

71
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:22,312
CEO! What the F are you talking about?
[chuckles]

72
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,547
You nothing but a saleswoman
that don't make no sales.

73
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:27,483
Yeah, Mama, that's a business.
Sometimes you don't make sale...

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,885
You ever heard of Steve Jobs?

75
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,787
What do you know
about a job?

76
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,489
Okay, Mama. You be like that.
I'm going next door.

77
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,892
Why you gotta spend
so much time with that girl?

78
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,561
You and her carting around
all them food stamps.

79
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:40,697
They're not food stamps.
They're coupons.

80
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,598
White people use them.
Why can't we?

81
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,867
Oh, so if white people
were jumping off a bridge...

82
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:46,502
Oh, my gosh. Again.

83
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,071
No, if white people
were jumping off a bridge,

84
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,506
- I would not jump off a bridge.
- Why you got such a damn attitude?

85
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,076
You're always talking about white people!
Like, no, of course not!

86
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:54,911
- Get on my nerves.
- [door slams]

87
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,085
Oh, hallelujah, praise the Lord.
Look who's here.

88
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:04,754
- The savior of savings.
- What up, Rick Dick?

89
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,689
Oh, hey,
I had a question for you.

90
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,358
Um, has anybody
ever been happy to see you?

91
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,128
Like, have you ever walked into
a room and someone's gone like,

92
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:15,465
"Hey, everybody, look!
My cool IRS auditor just walked in"?

93
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,100
- Yeah, they don't have to be happy.
- Oh, okay.

94
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,068
I'm respected. I'm valued.

95
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,536
[JoJo] Mmm.

96
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,105
- I'm leaving.
- There you go.

97
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,073
Those are the two words
we love to hear you say.

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,975
All right, now. Bye, Rick.

99
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,010
- Hey, Rick, I had one more question.
- [Rick] Don't slam...

100
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,147
- Hey, girl.
- Hiya, JoJo.

101
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:35,418
All right,
I have got some stuff for you.

102
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:36,886
- Look at all these.
- Oh, my gosh.

103
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,821
- Big day.
- Big day.

104
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,896
- [gasps] Buy one, get one.
- BOGO!

105
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,998
Rick should be happy
I taught you how to stockpile.

106
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,801
- Yeah, he doesn't get any of this.
- [sighs]

107
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:55,471
[gasps] Oh, lookee. I only need
one more Colgate proof of purchase

108
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,740
- to get a free AT&T gift card.
- You see that?

109
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,544
You think Rick knows how to pay
a phone bill with toothpaste? No.

110
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,613
You're winning.

111
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,616
Hey, did you know that winning actually
changes the way your brain works?

112
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:09,619
Like, every time you win,
you get a teensy bit smarter.

113
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,487
They call it
the winner effect.

114
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:15,124
You know, basically, the more you
win, the more you will win.

115
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,759
Winning becomes habit.

116
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:19,896
I really need a win.

117
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,035
[garbage rustling]

118
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:32,542
Yes!

119
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:55,097
You doing okay today, Greg?

120
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,736
You know,
I read that if you're lucky,

121
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:04,207
you only get about 30,000 days
on planet Earth.

122
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:05,875
- Right.
- That's not a lot.

123
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,878
Maybe you should try
to make every day count.

124
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,047
Total is $138.55.

125
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:13,983
Is it?

126
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,652
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

127
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,690
It's like
a thousand coupons, man.

128
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,260
[register beeping]

129
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,173
[beeping intensifies]

130
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,916
Well, good for you, lady.
You saved $122.10.

131
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,986
It is good for me, Greg.
It is good for me.

132
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,855
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

133
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:55,258
- All right.
- Sorry about the wait.

134
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:57,526
Don't be.
That was impressive.

135
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,228
Change.

136
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:02,765
Your trophy.

137
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,830
[Connie] <i>"Dear General Mills,</i>

138
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,799
<i>I recently purchased
a box of Wheaties cereal</i>

139
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,335
<i>from my local A&G Family Mart
here in Phoenix.</i>

140
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:43,706
<i>When I opened it, I discovered,
to my chagrin, that the cereal was stale.</i>

141
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,143
<i>As a former Olympic athlete,
I was very disappointed.</i>

142
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,578
<i>'Breakfast of champions'?</i>

143
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,949
<i>With cereal this stale,
it's more like 'breakfast of chump-ions.'"</i>

144
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:56,252
No shade, but, um, we both know
the before we were working with.

145
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,321
But why don't you
take a little look

146
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:01,924
- at the after! [chuckles]
- Oh, my God!

147
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,627
- Wow.
- Yes, girl! Look at you!

148
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:08,297
Who is that?
Is that Halle Berry from 2002?

149
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,665
[both chuckle]

150
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:11,067
So what I've used here

151
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,003
is the Back-2-Black
executive package.

152
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,239
I try to tell people, like, that
white-girl makeup does not work for us.

153
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,374
You know what I mean? Okay.

154
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,176
- Mm-hmm.
- You need your own stuff.

155
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:23,346
So, do we have a sale?

156
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:24,947
Do you take credit cards?

157
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:27,116
Unfortunately,
I can only accept cash.

158
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,685
I have a history
with identity theft.

159
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,988
- What?
- [chuckling] No. Girl. No, no, no.

160
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:34,757
No, I did not steal
anybody's identity. No way.

161
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,859
I had my identity stolen.
[sighs]

162
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,894
My credit's trash.
I can't even walk into a bank.

163
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,396
- Mmm.
- It's a whole thing. You don't even need

164
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,398
to worry
about that right now, so...

165
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,034

331
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,910
I am, uh, Ken Miller.

332
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,645
I'm the loss prevention
officer

333
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:19,515
for all the A&G Family Marts
across the Southwest.

334
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:22,217
You're lucky I was here today
to spot this little guy.

335
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:25,354
Take a look here.
See that expiration date?

336
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,890
Does that look familiar
to you? November 31st?

337
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:31,426
It shouldn't. There's only 30
days in the month of November.

338
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:33,629
So whoever tried to replicate
this little guy,

339
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,497
clearly, they didn't look
at a calendar.

340
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:36,932
Probably out of China.

341
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,501
You know, they screw up the dates
all the time. There's always a flaw.

342
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:41,937
You know, if you know what to look
for, it's easy to spot.

343
00:18:42,004 --> 00:18:44,373
Well, can you just make
an exception?

344
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,842
I mean, we could just honor
it, Ken, this one time.

345
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,711
She's been coming here
for, like, 150 years.

346
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:52,748
Yeah, I don't care if she's
Dame Judi Dench, Dave.

347
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,883
You leave the food out,
the critters will get it.

348
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,885
This is how this starts.
I'm just saying.

349
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,288
Sorry to compare you to rodents, ma'am.
I didn't mean that.

350
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:02,524
I just mean to say that rules are rules.
But if it helps, I...

351
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:05,427
If it helps? [scoffs]
I have hemorrhoids.

352
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,430
You know what helps, honey?
Preparation H.

353
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,666
Well, we're happy to sell
it to ya at full price.

354
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,401
[sniffs] Well,
then why don't you buy it?

355
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,369
Because you're
a giant asshole!

356
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:19,408
That's a good one, ma'am.

357
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:22,578
But as Dave will attest,
I've been told that before.

358
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,112
[exhales]

359
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,915
You should put that in the burn pile.
See you, Dave. I'll be back next month.

360
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:34,256
Hey, sorry. Um, would you mind if we
switched seats, just for this last part?

361
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,925
She really likes to watch
out the window as we land.

362
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,628
- And it helps calm her down.
- [chuckles] Mmm. Yeah.

363
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,930
No, even if
I wanted to switch,

364
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:46,768
I think it's more important that your
daughter learn a valuable lesson.

365
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:50,906
That's not how the world works, you know.
You don't always get your way.

366
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:54,910
[woman scoffs] Are you for real, dude?
[scoffs] Okay.

367
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,246
[breathing heavily]

368
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:06,822
[Ken sighs]

369
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,401
[sighs]

370
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:21,770
[whistles]

371
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:37,052
[yells] Fuck!

372
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,455
Fuck.

373
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,891
- [male singer sings indistinctly]
- [sighs]

374
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,502
So, what, we're just gonna
eeny, meeny, miny, mo,

375
00:20:53,568 --> 00:20:57,406
pick some random dude and be
like, "Could you steal for us?"

376
00:20:58,373 --> 00:21:00,942
Yeah.
We need someone on the inside.

377
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,045
We need an inside man.

378
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:06,415
[JoJo] Ooh, what about that guy? He
looks like that badass dude from <i>Machete.</i>

379
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,917
- Too sketchy.
- We want sketchy.

380
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,920
We want him to help us,
not chop us up into tiny pieces.

381
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:14,790
[JoJo] What about this Cesar
Millan-looking motherfucker?

382
00:21:15,457 --> 00:21:16,525
Too square.

383
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:21,863
We need that guy.

384
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,332
[JoJo] That guy?
Why that guy?

385
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,601
[Connie] 'Cause he's already
bending the rules.

386
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,471
[exhales]

387
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,641
Look at that. We got two
for the price of one.

388
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:35,343
- BOGO. [chuckles]
- BOGO.

389
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,879
Are you interested in a way
to make some more money?

390
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:40,415
No, that sounds creepy.
Just be like, "Oh, hey, we have a"...

391
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:41,983
- We have a business opportunity for you.
- Yes, yes.

392
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,552
- Okay. That's better.
- That's it, that's it.

393
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,089
[in Spanish]

394
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,759
- Okay. Here goes nothing.
- All right.

395
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:51,993
- [inhales sharply]
- [grunts]

396
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:54,930
[in Spanish]

397
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,399
Why is she running?

398
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,134
- Shit! Shit, shit.
- Oh, my God. Wait!

399
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,503
[in Spanish]

400
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,371
We have money. Money.
Dinero. Dinero. We have it!

401
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:05,774
[in Spanish]

402
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,043
No! Dinero. We have dinero for you.
We have it.

403
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,911
- [in Spanish]
- For you, yeah.

404
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:11,880
- For me? Oh.
- Yeah, man. Yeah.

405
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:12,914
[breathing heavily]

406
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,416
[tires screeching]

407
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,420
[grunting]

408
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:21,389
What is she doing?

409
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,391
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- [Alejandro] Oh, no, no, no!

410
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,927
- [screams] Stop! What... [gasps]
- [in Spanish]

411
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,429
Alejandro!

412
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,397
These women
are trying to help us.

413
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,967
[speaks Spanish,
groaning]

414
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,668
- Uh.
- It's okay. It's okay.

415
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:35,403
- [gasps]
- Oh!

416
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,673
[vomiting]

417
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,542
- Okay, here we go.
- [groans]

418
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,478
- Hi.
- Mmm. [speaks Spanish]

419
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:47,816
Okay, here we go.
You good? Okay, here we go.

420
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:54,890
You never trail someone
in Mexico. Ever.

421
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,158
You <i>estúpida.</i>

422
00:22:56,224 --> 00:22:58,660
[insults in Spanish]

423
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,562
[grunts, groans]

424
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,832
My... My wife is angry.
But she's right.

425
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:05,700
- [Rosa vomits]
- She is angry.

426
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,436
And also... pregnant?

427
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:11,873
- It is very early. But yes. [chuckles]
- Oh, wow.

428
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,942
Minimum wage
is only two dollars an hour.

429
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,077
Do you really have a way
for us to make some money?

430
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,915
Wait, your wage is two dollars an hour?
[scoffs]

431
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,150
That's a crime.
You gotta talk to somebody about that.

432
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:24,052
I should talk to my boss
and ask for a raise?

433
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,587
- Yes.
- Yes.

434
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,889
Yes, you should definitely
talk to your boss.

435
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:30,659
Are you crazy?
This company's American.

436
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,728
They only moved here so they
could take advantage of us.

437
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,164
That's all the more reason
you should hear us out.

438
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,504
These coupons. They all come
from your factory, yes?

439
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,806
<i>Sí, sí,</i>
we make all kinds of coupons.

440
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,476
We don't need all kinds.
Just the ones for free stuff.

441
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:49,778
Can you get more of these?

442
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,814
Are you asking me to steal?

443
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:59,688
Again, everyone is making it sound so
[stammers] bad, but it's... [stammers]

444
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:01,223
- Technically, yes.
- Yeah.

445
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:03,258
- Uh. [chuckles]
- [JoJo] Okay, okay.

446
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,126
It's like Robin Hood, okay?

447
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,996
You are gonna take these
coupons from this company

448
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,998
that pays you chump change,

449
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,601
and then we're gonna get them to
families who really need them.

450
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,670
She's right. Do you have any idea
how expensive diapers are? [scoffs]

451
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:18,240
And, obviously,
you would be sharing in the profits.

452
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:20,609
- [JoJo] Yeah.
- <i>La puta's</i> right.

453
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:25,013
But we don't need your Robin Hood.
We have Jesús Malverde.

454
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,816
He took from the rich
and gave to the poor families.

455
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,151
We will follow
in his footsteps.

456
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,722
Okay, yeah. Go with him. I mean,
this dude is dope as hell. I love it.

457
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:34,990
Rosa, no.

458
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,660
[both speaking Spanish]

459
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,039
A wise man once said,

460
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:55,777
"Family is not an important thing.
It is everything."

461
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:58,013
Was that Jesús Malverde
as well?

462
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,683
It is the words
of Michael J. Fox.

463
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,084
Michael J. Fox?

464
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,054
The damn actor?

465
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,790
- Like, Marty McFly?
- Doesn't matter who said it, JoJo.

466
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:09,858
He's right.

467
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:12,294
Michael J. Fox is right.

468
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:15,797
[sighs]

469
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:22,837
Okay. [chuckling]

470
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,339
- Yes.
- Yes?

471
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,974
- I will do it.
- [Connie] You will?

472
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,077
For real?
Like for... Oh. Oh, wow.

473
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:31,947
I mean, 'cause it took me a while
to get on board, and I know her.

474
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,082
- You are ready, huh?
- [breathes heavily]

475
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:36,017
And here is how we will do it.

476
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,721
[Alejandro] <i>The factory is split in two.
Printing and redemption.</i>

477
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,792
<i>And the right hand does not
know what the left hand does.</i>

478
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,728
<i>Rosa works on
the coupon redemption side.</i>

479
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,999
<i>All day counting used coupons,
very tedious.</i>

480
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:53,268
<i>And I work on the print side.</i>

481
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:57,005
<i>It is man's work.
Heavy lifting, dangerous.</i>

482
00:25:57,072 --> 00:26:00,675
- Just get to the point.
- Don't boss me. [inhales sharply]

483
00:26:01,443 --> 00:26:03,244
Anyway. [chuckles]

484
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,015
<i>With each coupon we print,
there is always extra.</i>

485
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:10,018
<i>Even with the free coupons.</i>

486
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:14,055
<i>It is normal for us to destroy
these extra coupons.</i>

487
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,058
But no more.

488
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,728
Oh, Alejandro,
you very sexy right now.

489
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,062
[inhales]

490
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:23,398
[Alejandro] Instead,
I will send them to you.

491
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,368
<i>Our trucks ship coupons
all across the US.</i>

492
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,270
<i>And as for the border,
this is no problem.</i>

493
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,774
<i>They stop drugs because
there is a war on drugs.</i>

494
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,343
<i>But who cares about coupons?</i>

495
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:37,679

[chuckles]

500
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:50,425
Okay, Mama,
just please be quiet, okay?

501
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:53,294
[Mama Josie] I ain't saying a word.
[chuckles]

502
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,931
Yo, yo, yo.
It's time to save with JoJo.

503
00:26:56,998 --> 00:27:00,068
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

504
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:01,770
- [chuckles]
- [Mama Josie] It's you.

505
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,005
I have to start again now!

Whoa, look at that. Free!

513
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:42,143
Okay.

[corporate executive 2] <i>There's
been a run on Schick razors.</i>

527

<i>In the past month,
this one counterfeit coupon</i>

528
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:56,217
<i>has cost us hundreds of
thousands of dollars.</i>

529
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:59,521
[corporate executive 3] <i>Uh, we've
had, uh, several of your A&G stores</i>

<i>attempting to redeem this counterfeit
coupon for Huggies diapers.</i>

531

<i>these redemption numbers,</i>

533

calling on all LPOs</i>

<i>The key was finding discounts that
matched the coupons in question.</i>

542
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,053
<i>It was no small task.</i>

543
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,356
Aha! Yes! [crying]

544
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:37,559
[Ken] <i>Then, accessing
our financial database,</i>

545

I was able to trace the credit

And here we are today.

547
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,599
But you're not a detective.

548
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:47,368
'Cause you sort of look
like a detective.

549
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:50,104
Detective...
Do I look like a detective?

550
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,341
Huh. I'll pocket that
compliment for a rainy day.

551
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:57,111
I, uh, no,
I work for A&G Family Mart.

552
00:29:57,178 --> 00:30:00,048
Anyways, let's cut to
the Chevy Chase here.

553
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,584
If I ask a question,
just assume I know the answer.

554
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,953
So, stick to the facts,
would you, ma'am?

555
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,121
Spill it.
Where'd you get the coupons?

556
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,123
Uh, okay.

557
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,127
Well, a friend sent me this video
of this Black woman going on and on

558
00:30:13,194 --> 00:30:15,129
about all this stuff
she got for half off

559
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:18,533
with these coupons
from some website.

560
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,101
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna stop you there.

561
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:23,037
You purchased these coupons
off a website?

562
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:26,241
Do you have any idea how many
Cheerios a one-year-old goes through?

563
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:27,976
Well, what's the name
of this website?

564
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:32,280
Uh, Super Snappy Saver?

565
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:35,149
Super Snazzy something.

566
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:37,418
- Snazzy Super Saver.
- Uh... [sighs]

567
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,921
I remember thinking,
"What a dumb name."

568
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,457
Yeah. Sp-Speedy Shopper?
Could that be it?

569
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:44,225
Speedy Shopper?
No. That's not even close.

570
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,027
Well, I'm trying
to be helpful.

571
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,595
- You said you already knew the answers.
- [baby crying]

572
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:49,964

- One minute.

573
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:00,541
[Crystal] Savvy!

574
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,244

[Crystal] Savvy Super Saver.

576
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,914
Savvy, is that one V or two?

577
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:10,018
Oh, no, I guess one would be
"savy." So it's two. Two V's.

00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,236
We're filling
hundreds of orders a day.

583
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,705
Don't you feel like this is
all happening way too fast?

584
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:33,374
No, fast is good. Fast is...

585
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,177
- Oh, crap.
- What?

586
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,347
Frozen? No. No.

587
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:42,583
Connie, I told you this
is all happening too fast!

588
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,552
I'm like,
"Whoop, whoop, whoop!"

589
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,521
Alarm bells
are just going off in my mind.

590
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:47,955
- Let me refresh it.
- So just...

591
00:31:48,022 --> 00:31:49,390
Okay, close the page.
Start again.

592
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:50,658
Did we lose all that money?

593
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,660
- I don't know.
- Fuck!

594
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:54,962
- [sighs]
- [Connie] Uh-huh.

595
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,632
- Uh-huh, yep. So...
- [sighs]

596
00:31:57,699 --> 00:32:02,403
Abnormally large amounts of money
in the account. Right. [chuckles]

597
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,640
- [sighs]
- Okay, and... and how do we unfreeze it?

598
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,577
[Connie] Uh-huh.

599
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:12,747
Oh, so we just have to prove
that it's a legitimate business.

600
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:15,983
Okay. Got it.

601
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,752
- Yes.
- [exhales deeply]

602
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:21,022
All good. Okay. Okey dokey.
Thanks so much. Bye.

603
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,991
I knew this was
too good to be true.

604
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:25,526
Is it though? [inhales]

605
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:28,496
The PayPal rep
made it seem simple enough.

606
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,199
We just need someone who's had
experience with this sort of thing.

607
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:34,635
Like selling stolen shit for
abnormally large amounts of money.

608
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,337
- Like that sort of thing?
- Exactly.

609
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:39,540
Oh, okay. [sighs]

610
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,776
What about that girl
who stole your identity?

611
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:44,345
Tempe Tina? Really?

612
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:48,182
You wanna go to the little
brat who ruined my entire life?

613
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:51,319
- [sighs]
- JoJo...

614
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,554
- Girl, this is unnecessary.
- I know, but we need her.

615
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:54,455
What the fuck
is this about?

616
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:56,290
Just to clear the air,

617
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:59,026
the shit I did to you as a
kid, that was a side gig, okay.

618
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,795
I dabble in the dark web.

619
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:04,565
Okay, well, just to clear the
air on my side, just so you know,

620
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:07,668
after that little stunt you
pulled, I went to the police.

621
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,470
- They didn't help me.
- That's true.

622
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:11,606
I went to social security.
They didn't believe me.

623
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,608
And I went to my bank.
And guess what?

624
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:15,610
Those motherfuckers
didn't trust me.

625
00:33:15,676 --> 00:33:18,579
[JoJo] Girl, you know,
I had so much debt because of you.

626
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:20,481
I had to move back home
with my mama.

627
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:24,085
You know how embarrassing that shit is?
I'm a grown-ass woman.

628
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,653
I'm really sorry about that.

629
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,655
I-I really... I had no idea.

630
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:29,157
[JoJo] Yeah, well, okay.

631
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,059
- Electric car?
- What?

632
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:35,329
Is this an electric car?
It's just so quiet, isn't it?

633
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:37,198
I mean, I've never been
blindfolded before,

634
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,066
and it's true what they say.

635
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,436
All your other senses
are so heightened.

636
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:44,338
[JoJo] Ooh...

637
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,207
- Did we just go over train tracks?
- I felt that.

638
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,742
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

639
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,111
- They are heightened, I...
- [chuckles] That's so weird.

640
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,647
Are you eating Juicy Fruit?
The gum. Is that what you eatin'?

641
00:33:52,713 --> 00:33:54,615
You smell that?
Oh, I love Juicy Fruit.

642
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:57,318
- Oh, I haven't had it in forever.
- Me either. Me either.

643
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:58,786
Can you guys
just shut the fuck up?

644
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,154
[JoJo] Okay, rude.

645
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,123
My specialty
is cybersecurity.

646
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,559
You guys have any idea
what that means?

647
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,860
- No. Not a clue.
- No.

648
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,463
Okay. Governments
and global corporations

649
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:11,332
deal with security attacks
every single day.

650
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,302
My job is to identify 'em,
prevent 'em,

651
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:18,139
or, if they pay me enough,
to create 'em.

652
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,342
- Humblebrag.
- [chuckles]

653
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:28,649
[Tempe Tina] How the fuck did you
make this kind of coin from coupons?

654
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:29,750
Take 'em off.

655
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,320
- Whew.
- [sighs]

656
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:34,222
You can't have this much money
flowing in a single account.

657
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:36,657
I can unfreeze this for you,
but we gotta spread this shit out.

658
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:39,694
I'm talking MoneyPak, PayPal,
Venmo, Google Pay.

659
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,363
[scoffs]

660
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,432
Okay, wow. [chuckles]

661
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,567
You're cashing in
with this craptacular site,

662
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:48,169
Savvy Super Saver?

663
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,471
- It was a template.
- Right.

664
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,241
And the site isn't savvy,
the shoppers are.

665
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,408
There we go. That part.

666
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,610
The site is registered

667
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,712
to a Charles Barkin
from Hackensack.

668
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:01,148
Charlie Barkin. It's from
<i>All Dogs Go to Heaven.</i>

669
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:04,485
- And the address is a Petco in New Jersey.
- Boom.

670
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:08,556
Well, look at you. We got ourselves
a couple of queenpins in the making.

671
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:11,425
- Damn, you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,661
- We queenpins, bitch. [chuckles]
- [giggles]

673
00:35:13,728 --> 00:35:16,397
[Tempe Tina] Relax, 'cause it's still
way too easy to trace back to you.

674
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:19,667
Is there anything else
I should know about?

675
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:22,436
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
It's time to save with JoJo.</i>

676
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:24,839
<i>You know what makes your booty
so fine?</i>

677
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:28,910
<i>Half-off booty
from savvysupersaver.com.</i>

678
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,580
Seriously?

679
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:34,415
You see, my YouTube's
a part of my brand, so...

680
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:36,684
<i>That's 48 real rolls,
okay, y'all?</i>

681
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,953
<i>Head over to Savvy Super Sa...</i>

682
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:44,458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Where you go, girl?

683
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,295
Trust me, nobody gives a bag
of dicks about your brand.

684
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:49,764
What you guys need
is a front for your business.

685
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,965
All of this money is dirty,

686
00:35:51,032 --> 00:35:53,467
so don't go spending dough
on shit you can't write off.

687
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:54,902
Give it six months,

688
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,538
and make sure it ain't
Alarm-ageddon out there.

689
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:01,309
You got that? And to start,
we need aliases, and lots of 'em.

690
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,412
From there, we open up bank
accounts, apply for credit cards,

691
00:36:04,478 --> 00:36:07,381
and don't be doing this shit
at home.

692
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,383
Rent a stash house, okay?

693
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,253
And from now on, use this.
It's an IronKey.

694
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,655
It's military-grade encryption.
Just stick it in your USB.

695
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:18,326
Uh, for my help, I take 10%
of everything you make.

696
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:19,827
Girl, what?

697
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:21,262
Well, I'm worth it.

698
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,297
- [sighs]
- The good news is, ladies,

699
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,399
is you are entering
a real growth industry, okay.

700
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:28,402
Pink-collar crime,
it's fly as fuck right now.

701
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:31,405
We get you square,
and this coupon hustle,

702
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:33,674
it's gonna pay off
in a big, big way.

703
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,678
Could you say it all again
and, like, much slower?

704
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,847
I don't know what half
those things you said were.

705
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:42,316
- And do you have a pad and pen maybe?
- Pen and paper, yeah.

706
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,418
Or give me my phone back.
I'll take notes.

707
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,887
- Just to write it down.
- No. No.

708
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,956
- We don't got it, but we got it.
- We will wing it.

709
00:36:58,032 --> 00:36:59,734
[Ken] <i>Yeah, I mean,
you and me are...</i>

710
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,969
We're standing on the tip
of the iceberg here.

711
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,772
Ah, it's probably just...
[sighs] ...China.

712
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:07,808
Oh. Can't be China.

713
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,610
Why not China?

714
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:12,380
Ah, no, China's just...
You gotta trust me on this one.

715
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,682
I mean these...
these are gall-damn perfect.

716
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:17,718
You know this...
China couldn't pull this one off. No.

717
00:37:17,785 --> 00:37:19,687
These... It's all
in the file folder.

718
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:21,589
- I mean, the, uh, coupon warning sheets...
- Yeah. Okay.

719
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,557
...the website,
the interview with the mother.

720
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,793
- It's... It's... It's a real bombshell.
- Yeah.

721
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,597
Don't say bombshell
in an FBI building.

722
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,933
- I thought maybe don't say bomb.
- Don't say bomb anything.

723
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,835
- Sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

724
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:38,606
No, I just... I'm trying to
relay the severity of the case.

725
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,807
I just, uh...

726
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,709
This is a crisis
at a national level.

727
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:44,311
- This is my Pelican Brief.
- Okay. Okay.

728
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,380
- Okay. Ken? Ken, okay.
- Yes, sir.

729
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,850
Ken, you have my attention.
You have her attention.

730
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,452
Oh. Hey.

731
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,056
I think we should run this
up the chain to HQ.

732
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:59,427
- That's, uh, it's good to hear that.
- Yeah.

733
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,362
'Cause, I mean,
that's great.

734
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,963
Uh, we're gonna need a whole
team working on this thing.

735
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,498
Yep, yep. Mm-hmm.

736
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,635
- Is... Do you do tours?
- Uh, we d... We don't.

737
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,603
Well, you got my card.
I gave you my card and that.

738
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,638
Yeah, we got your card.

739
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,039
- We got your email.
- Email.

740
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,375
We got your... your snail mail.
We got everything.

741
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,876
- [chuckles] Trust me, trust me.
- [Ken] That's good.

742
00:38:15,943 --> 00:38:17,878
You're going to be hearing
from DC real soon. Yeah.

743
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:20,514
- Okay. Thanks so much, guys. This is fun.
- Thank you.

744
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:22,450
- Appreciate it, uh...
- We'll do it again.

745
00:38:22,516 --> 00:38:24,118
Ken. See you, Ken.

746
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:31,692
Who the fuck let that kook in here?
I mean, come on. Coupons? Coupons?

747
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,928
Dealing with
national security, terrorism,

748
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:36,363
and this nutbag
is babbling on about coupons.

749
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,698
I can't... Just... Here.

750
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,602
Why don't we let that shit
get lost in DC?

751
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:45,072
[Ken] <i>This is Ken Miller.</i>

752
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:48,442
<i>Salt Lake City referred
my coupon case to HQ.</i>

<i>All right. Ken Miller.</i>

757
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,595
- Looking for someone?
- [clerk] I was told to find

758
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,064
the lowest rung on the ladder.
Is that you?

759
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:11,932
[sighs]

760
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:17,705
- [clerk] This is for you.
- Thank you.

761
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,773
Mm-hmm.

762
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:46,834
- Nice truck!
- Nice new house!

763
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:49,937
- So big!
- Thank you. [chuckles]

764
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,806
Had to rent it

<i>I am sitting here waiting.

<i>The "I" still stands for
investigation, right?</i>

776

- [pants] It's been six months!
- [chuckles] I know.

777
00:40:42,723 --> 00:40:47,761
Today's the day we finally
get to spend our money!

778
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:50,831
I know. Hey, I added up
everything in all of our accounts.

779
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,666
- Mm-hmm.
- You wanna know what we've got?

780
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,501
[clears throat]

781
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:57,104
- 5,230,000...
- What?

782
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,772
...and 55 cents.

783
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:00,241
- We're millionaires!
- I know! [laughing]

00:41:00,307 --> 00:41:03,077
- We're filthy fucking rich!

791
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,162
Didn't Tempe Tina say
that all the money is dirty?

792
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,099
- What?
- [sighs] We still have to clean it.

793
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,735
- Fuck!

794
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,938
Did she? Wha... [sighs]
Call her ass up.

795
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,706
[sighs]

796
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,744
[voice recording] <i>We're sorry.

<i>If you feel you have re...</i>

799
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,983
Think she's using
a burner phone?

800
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:45,319
What do we do now?
I'm a multimillionaire

801
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:46,987
and I can't spend
any of my money?

802
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:48,255
That's fucking bullshit.

803
00:41:48,322 --> 00:41:50,257
Wait a minute.

804
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,326
- Rick.
- What about him?

805
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:55,296
Rick is always griping to me

806
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,765
about how these different
companies hide their money.

807
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:00,868
They funnel money through, like,
offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands.

808
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,304
Honestly, I try to tune out
all of the audit talk,

809
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:08,142
but there was this one story about this
comptroller guy in Tacoma, Washington,

810
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:10,077
who embezzled $25 million.

811
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:14,281
And the only reason I remember
is because his name was Guy Rich.

812
00:42:14,348 --> 00:42:16,150
- Guy Rich?
- That's what I said.

813
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:18,052
Rick was like, "Yeah."

814
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:22,356
Anyway, he said that Guy's
stupidity actually helped him.

815
00:42:22,423 --> 00:42:24,792
'Cause he didn't know anything
about the Cayman Islands account.

816
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:27,895
So what he did instead
was bought a bunch of stuff.

817
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,863
And then he went out
and sold it,

818
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,600
and whatever he made
from selling it was clean.

819
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,870
JoJo, we need to get all of our money
out of these different bank accounts,

820
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:40,607
buy a bunch of expensive stuff
and then sell it.

821

00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:04,611
I called the FBI, and I said,
"Can you help me out?"

986
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:07,814
They said, "Sure, boots on the ground."
And then they brought me a postman.

987
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:12,319
All right, Ken, I tell you what.
You seem to know a lot about coupons.

988
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:17,190
So, why don't you order some off the
website, and they'll come in the mail.

989
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:19,226
And then we can all see
where they're from.

990
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:23,296
But, uh, just to be clear so
there's good boundaries in place,

991
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:24,798
we're not partners.

992
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:28,802
[inhales sharply] But what
about you making me, uh,

993
00:51:28,869 --> 00:51:31,671
some sort of a deputized
citizen or something?

994
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:33,573
Just from
a placard standpoint.

995
00:51:34,975 --> 00:51:37,577
- A deputized citizen?
- Yeah.

996
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:39,880
So what am I doing?
Am I forming a posse here?

997
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:41,915
No, I'm sorry. It's...

998
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:44,784
What's your action item?

999
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:48,255
- My... My actionable item?
- What is your action item?

1000
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:51,258
Action item is to order
the coupons off the website.

1001
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,929
That's a good i...
That was a good idea too.

1002
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,635
Oh, yes.

1003
00:52:04,271 --> 00:52:06,373
Guns? No. No way.

1004
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,875
Not happening. Never.

1005
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:11,478
We can go to Shake Baby after
and get a milkshake.

1006
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:16,283
What has
the best resale value?

1007
00:52:16,349 --> 00:52:18,818
We're looking for
a good investment.

1008
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,555
All right, well,
that'd probably be this here.

1009
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:24,858
This is a KelTec
KSG tactical shotgun.

1010
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:27,460
It's pump-action. Right?

1011
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:29,829
Now y'all seen <i>John Wick,</i> right?
John Wick movies?

1012
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,765
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:33,333
There ain't
no better commercial for a gun

1014
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,834
than a John Wick movie.

1015
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,838
The moment Keanu
used this sexy bad boy,

1016
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,874
the price just went
straight through the roof.

1017
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,343
Is it cheaper
if we buy them in bulk?

1018
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,478
[both slurping]

1019
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,583
- [swallows] Ah.
- Mmm.

1020
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:51,718
Mmm.

1021
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,520
That probably shouldn't
have been that easy.

Oh, okay.

1037
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:37,430
Um, I'm gonna pay off
Mama Josie's mortgage...

1038
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,666
- Mmm, mm-hmm.
- ...hire her a live-in housekeeper,

1039
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:41,935
and then, I don't know.

1040
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:45,271
I wanna go somewhere exotic.
Like somewhere with a beach.

1041
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:46,840

- Mmm.

What are you gonna do with your share?

1043
00:53:48,742 --> 00:53:50,777
Well...

1044
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,814
- Okay. You want to hear something crazy?
- Always.

1045
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:58,952
I made an appointment
at the fertility clinic.

1046
00:54:00,453 --> 00:54:02,288
And I know it's a long shot,

1047
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:04,691
but I just figured, why not?
You know?

1048
00:54:04,758 --> 00:54:07,994
Yeah, okay. [chuckles]
Uh... What did Rick say?

1049
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:10,330
I didn't tell Rick.

1050
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:12,932
I was kinda hoping
you'd go with me.

1051
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,671
Connie. Of course!
You know I gotta go.

1052
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,806
- You will? [chuckles]
- Yes!

1053
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:22,475
'Cause when this little girl asks her
auntie JoJo the story of her life,

1054
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:25,845
I'm gonna say, "Girl,
this all started with a coupon."

1055
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:27,580
[chuckles]

1056
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:32,752
Okay, so what we got here
is a address for a pet store,

1057
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,054
a Petco in Kansas.

1058
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,622
I Google Mapped it.

1059
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,091
The nearest airport
is Kansas City, Missouri.

1060
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:41,695
So I took the liberty of booking us
a little red-eye flight over there.

1061
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,663
Booked us? Okay.

1062
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:46,633
Ken, we are not doing this.
We are not...

1063
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,669
Kansas, huh?
Did you check the postage?

1064
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:52,839
- What, like the stamp?
- Well, there is no stamp.

1065
00:54:52,906 --> 00:54:55,108
They're using
an online postage service,

1066
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:57,444
which also means
there's no postmark.

1067
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:00,613
- Okay, so...
- Okay, so the zip code on the postmark

1068
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,349
and the zip code on the return
address, well, they don't match.

1069
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:06,720
So, the return address, well,
that's Kansas, anything starting with 6-6.

1070
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:09,456
And the postage, 8-5-0-1-3,

1071
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:11,691
anything starting with 8-5,
that's Arizona.

1072
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:15,028
And the last three digits,
0-1-3, that's Phoenix.

1073
00:55:15,095 --> 00:55:17,097
So screw
what the return address says.

1074
00:55:17,163 --> 00:55:18,765
These things were mailed...

1075
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:21,134
Mailed from Phoenix.
That's impressive. Holy shit.

1076
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:22,569
[stammers] I'm sorry.

1077
00:55:22,635 --> 00:55:24,704
Did you actually memorize
the zip code

1078
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:25,872
for every city in the country?

1079
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:28,007
I'm a postal inspector, Ken.

1080
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,477
And all things being equal,

1081
00:55:30,543 --> 00:55:32,746
the simplest explanation
tends to be the right one.

1082
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,447
Oh, my God.

1083
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:35,749
So if those things
were mailed out of Phoenix,

1084
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:37,484
then the criminal outfit
behind these are...

1085
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,952
- From Phoenix.
- ...also in Phoenix.

1086
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:40,954
Yeah, that's... You gotta
let me in on this thing.

1087
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,490
I'm Mr. Phoenix.
I'm there every month.

1088
00:55:43,556 --> 00:55:45,925
There's nine A&G stores
in the area. I can help.

1089
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:48,461
- Ken, we've been through it.
- Please, come on.

1090
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:55,168
All right.
I shouldn't be doing this.

1091
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:57,637
- What are you...
- Okay.

1092
00:55:57,704 --> 00:55:59,639
Put your left hand on my badge
and raise your right hand.

1093
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:02,575
- Oh, holy shit. Yes, yes, yes. Okay.
- Repeat after me.

1094
00:56:02,642 --> 00:56:04,644
I, Ken Miller,
do solemnly swear...

1095
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:06,713
I, Ken Miller,
do solemnly swear...

1096
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,181
That I'm being fucked with.

1097
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:10,917
That I'm being...
Oh, fuck you, man. Come on!

1098
00:56:10,984 --> 00:56:12,552
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- I don't know.

1099
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,054
I don't have the power to make you a
deputy on anything. We've talked about it.

1100
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,957
Thought you might give me a chance.
I thought maybe you would... [sighs]

1101
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:20,460
Okay, listen. Y-You're right.

1102
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:24,831
Fifteen years I've spent tracking lowlifes
shoving shit in their pockets. I get it.

1103
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:28,468
But it's a real case.
I... I... [sighs]

1104
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:31,604
I thought you'd give me a chance at
doing something that actually mattered.

1105
00:56:33,873 --> 00:56:36,676
I... Oh, shit.

1106
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,912
Maybe you can help.

1107
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,513
You do know Phoenix,
and you already gave me

1108
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,015
a really good lead
with those coupons.

1109
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:43,983
And I don't want you
to feel bad.

1110
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,186
ATF, DEA, FBI,

1111
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:48,955
most of those assholes would already
be on a plane to Kansas by now.

1112
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:51,858
But you can't cheat the mail.

1113
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:53,760
[Dr. Girard] <i>And you
can't cheat Father Time.</i>

1114
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,130
There is a price to pay for all
your training over the years.

1115
00:56:57,197 --> 00:57:01,801
[inhales deeply] I hate to say it.
This is... [sighs] ...your last shot.

1116
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,171
Well...

1117
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:07,640
- I'm egg-cited to give it a go.
- [chuckles]

1118
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:11,044
Egg humor. [chuckles]
Well, here's one for you.

1119
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,612
Uh, last time we tried this,

1120
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:16,082
your average yield
was only four or five eggs.

1121
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:18,251
Whew. [clears throat]
Damn, girl.

1122
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:20,620
But the good news
is that we still have

1123
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,755
some of Rick's sperm
from last time. So...

1124
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:26,092
Uh, do we have to use
his sperm?

1125
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,263
[chuckles] Well, no, but...

1126
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:33,166
I mean, he is your husband.

1127
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:36,903
Yeah, I think
we'd like to shop around.

1128
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,973
- Okay, so there's no photos?
- [nurse] No photos.

1129
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,908
- It feels like a huge flaw in the system.
- [nurse] Aw.

1130
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:45,178
- What about that one?
- Oh. Well, let's take a closer look.

1131
00:57:50,016 --> 00:57:51,651
Geez.

1132
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,888
This donor was very active.
We have over 400 vials.

1133
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:57,523
- 400?
- [nurse chuckles] Yeah.

1134
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,225
6'2", high IQ,

1135
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:01,561
- extremely high motility levels.
- Ooh.

1136
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:03,630
His little guys
are like Olympic swimmers.

1137
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:05,832
- Olympic?
- [nurse] Uh-huh.

1138
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,967
- Hello, Mr. Baby Batter.
- [chuckles]

1139
00:58:08,034 --> 00:58:10,837
[gasps] You know what?

1140
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,640
I bet a lot of women can't
afford high-quality sperm.

1141
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:16,075
[Connie] We could get it to
them at a discount price.

1142
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:17,977
Do you take cash?

1143
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:27,887
Did we just spend $330,000
on one man's sperm?

1144
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:30,089
[chuckles]

1145
00:58:30,156 --> 00:58:33,026
You know, I bet we'll be the first
people to launder money selling semen.

1146
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,594
- [cell phone buzzing]
- Right?

1147
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:36,562
[chuckles] I don't know.

1148
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,731
[Connie] Getting a call
from Switzerland.

1149
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:39,832
Weird.

1150
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:41,834
Hello?

1151
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:44,837
Oh, hey, Tina.

1152
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:46,306
Are... Are you in Switzerland?

1153
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,776
Oh, no, right. You're here.

1154
00:58:49,842 --> 00:58:51,277
Oh, you're here, here.

1155
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:54,080
Yeah, okay.
Uh, we'll be out in a jiff.

1156
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:57,050
- She's here.
- Oh.

1157
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:07,860
Tempe, Juicy Fruit?

1158
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:20,807
[Tempe Tina] Any idea
why I brought you guys here?

1159
00:59:20,873 --> 00:59:21,941
- No.
- No.

1160
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:23,910
Where the fuck
is all your money?

1161
00:59:24,744 --> 00:59:26,879
- Oh, that. We...
- Oh.

1162
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:29,649
- [Connie] Um, relax.
- [JoJo] Girl, we got it.

1163
00:59:29,716 --> 00:59:31,918
We took care of everything.
I mean, we're self-starters.

1164
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,721
- We're queenpins. Remember you said?
- That's who you're looking at.

1165
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:36,222
- You said it.
- "Queenpins." [chuckles]

1166
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:37,657
We're cleaning it!

1167
00:59:37,724 --> 00:59:41,060
Okay. And, uh,
why are you cleaning it?

1168
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:45,198
- Because it's... dirty.
- It's dirty, Tina.

1169
00:59:45,264 --> 00:59:48,768
You don't have any dirty money.
Do you know why?

1170
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:52,705
'Cause your front company
Back-2-Black's sole purpose

1171
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:54,240
is to clean your money.

1172
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:57,210
So, you're...
you're telling us that w...

1173
00:59:58,478 --> 00:59:59,512
- Wait.
- That we don't...

1174
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,914
- All the fucking money is already clean?
- Oh, my God.

1175
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,783
I'm just, like, over you guys.

1176
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,852
- Can I be honest?
- Yeah.

1177
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:07,754
- I wish you would've let me write...
- That's what I'm saying.

1178
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,789
You didn't let her write it
down, so we didn't know.

1179
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,325
I asked for a pad. You said it was dirty.
I got home. I...

1180
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:14,927
All right. You're gonna go to
the bank every couple of days.

1181
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:17,063
Just take the money
in small increments. Okay?

1182
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,731
And put it in the bank
in small increments.

1183
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:20,666
Can you do that?
And not fuck that up?

1184
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:23,036
We can...
That's something we can totally do.

1185
01:00:23,102 --> 01:00:25,171
We st...
We, um... [stammers]

1186
01:00:25,238 --> 01:00:28,141
We still have
some of it left, but...

1187
01:00:29,142 --> 01:00:30,877
We bought a few things.

1188
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,413
[Tempe Tina] A few things?

1189
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:37,683
You guys said a few things.
This is not a few things.

1190
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,220
This is a big red flag.
You need to sell this shit now.

1191
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:42,922
Okay. Yeah.

1192
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:44,457
We also bought
a bunch of guns.

1193
01:00:44,524 --> 01:00:47,393
[Tempe Tina] Guns?
Where are you gonna sell guns?

1194
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:50,029
We're gonna
figure that out.

1195
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,165
Or eBay.

1196
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,134
- Or eBay.
- Was my first thought.

1197
01:00:56,436 --> 01:00:58,805
There's nothing more
important than the mail, Ken.

1198
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:02,175
People put pen to paper
with their innermost thoughts.

1199
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,111
And then they seal it in an
envelope, and they put a stamp on it.

1200
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:07,413
They trust us with their
secrets, and we deliver.

1201
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,015
Yeah, no, I guess...

1202
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,417
I have a hard time
believing anybody gives a hoot

1203
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:13,719
when they get a letter
in the mail.

1204
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:16,089
[scoffs] Yeah.

1205
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:26,299
I have a feeling
that Leo F. Sullivan

1206
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:28,734
gave a hoot about getting
a letter in the mail.

1207
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:35,942
Marked October 16th, 1918.

1208
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:37,743
[clears throat]

1209
01:01:39,378 --> 01:01:41,280
"Dear Mary,

1210
01:01:41,347 --> 01:01:44,217
I received two of your
letters a couple weeks ago,

1211
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,019
and they brought the usual
amount of good cheer.

1212
01:01:47,086 --> 01:01:50,223
Those letters made the trip
with me to the front,

1213
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:54,127
and now all I have to do
is put my hand in my pocket,

1214
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:55,761
and there you are.

1215
01:01:55,828 --> 01:01:57,830
I spoke to
Father Tom Holbrook

1216
01:01:57,897 --> 01:02:00,766
about my big desire within
to return to you

1217
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:05,338
and the ache in my heart to meet our
little Irene and hold her in my arms.

1218
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:07,874
I took my last confession

1219
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,977
and now head out to battle
with a clear conscience

1220
01:02:11,043 --> 01:02:15,448
and a heart full of thoughts
of you, my dear, sweet Mary.

1221
01:02:15,515 --> 01:02:19,485
As ever I remain,
Leo F. Sullivan."

1222
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:24,357
[breathes deeply]

1223
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:29,262
I think some people do care
about getting a letter, Ken.

1224
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,134
- Wait, wha... what happened?
- What do you mean what happened?

1225
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:36,536
Did he make it?

1226
01:02:36,602 --> 01:02:39,805
You know, did he, um...
did he survive the battle?

1227
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:42,108
Doesn't matter if Leo made
it or Leo didn't make it.

1228
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,878
What matters is that the letter survived.
The letter made it.

1229
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:47,980
And it's something
that we take very seriously.

1230
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:50,950
Yeah, I get that. I just...

1231
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,819
It's hard not to think
about the Sullivan family.

1232
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:56,956
What... Whatever happened to Mary?
Did she become a widow?

1233
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,058
Ken. Ken, it was
a hundred years ago.

1234
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,960
All the Sullivans
are probably dead.

1235
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,063
I wonder.
Did he ever get to hold Irene?

1236
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:06,299
Are these relatives
of yours? Are they...

1237
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,968
I think we're all related
in some ways. Don't you, Ken?

1238
01:03:09,969 --> 01:03:10,970
Hmm?

1239
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,038
[alarm chirps]

1240
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:13,839
[Ken] Welcome to Phoenix.

1241
01:03:13,906 --> 01:03:17,610
5,000 square miles of hot-as-shit
desert, suburban sprawl.

1242
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:20,613
Yeah, well, some haystacks
are bigger than others,

1243
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,982
but the bad guys
are out there.

1244
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:24,383
Trouble for them,

1245
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,286
they decided to do bad things
through the mail.

1246
01:03:27,353 --> 01:03:29,855
Now we're gonna handle this
the post office way.

1247
01:03:29,922 --> 01:03:32,124
Yeah, I kinda wish you
hadn't read me that letter.

1248
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:34,994
I can't stop thinking
if that guy survived or not.

1249
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,230
Oh, Ken, you're missing
the point of it.

1250
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:41,167
[captain] <i>...where the temperature is
currently 89 degrees, southwest winds...</i>

1251
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,338
[door opens]

1252
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:50,910
[door closes]

1253
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,399
Hey. What's going on
around here?

1254
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:18,037
Did we get a new TV?

1255
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,374
[chuckles]
I can't get anything past you.

1256
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,175
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

1257
01:04:23,242 --> 01:04:26,312
You know,
you telling me to get a job

1258
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:29,115
was exactly the push I needed
to realize I could do better.

1259
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,584
So I marched out there,
and I got a job.

1260
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:33,586
A job doing what?

1261
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:36,555
Sales.
Just a boring old sales job.

1262
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,425
You know, filling orders
and stuffing envelopes mostly.

1263
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:42,261
And the couponing?
What's going on with that?

1264
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:44,463
Oh, I don't use coupons
anymore.

1265
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:45,464
You're shitting me.

1266
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:47,166
I hope you don't mind.

1267
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:49,969
I used my first paycheck
to buy you your 4K TV.

1268
01:04:50,036 --> 01:04:52,371
Why would I mind?
I mean... [chuckles]

1269
01:04:52,438 --> 01:04:56,175
...got a brand-new TV
and a brand-new wife.

1270
01:04:58,377 --> 01:05:01,047
Yep. Connie 2.0.

1271
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:02,281
Enjoy.

1272
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,320
Are you sure you don't wanna
discuss this with your husband

1273
01:05:07,386 --> 01:05:09,322
before I implant the embryos?

1274
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:11,557
Remember,
I can't un-bake the cake.

1275
01:05:11,624 --> 01:05:14,193
Dude. It's her body.
It's her choice.

1276
01:05:15,728 --> 01:05:17,163
No.

1277
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:19,365
We didn't use
any of his ingredients.

1278
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:21,701
He doesn't deserve
a piece of my cake.

1279
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:25,304
[store manager] You all know Ken
Miller, the store's LPO.

1280
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:28,507
And with him
is Simon Kilmurry.

1281
01:05:28,574 --> 01:05:30,743
He's an FBI agent
who wants to ask you...

1282
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,179
- A postal inspector.
- What's that?

1283
01:05:33,245 --> 01:05:35,348
I'm a US postal inspector.

1284
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:39,251
Oh. He's a postal inspector,
whatever that means.

1285
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:42,388
We're just looking for any customers
with strange coupon habits,

1286
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:46,992
any irregular coupon activity,
uh, frequency of use,

1287
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:50,363
any customers who have
unusually high savings.

1288
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:53,999
First of all, people literally
forget you're even a human being.

1289
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:57,136
Then she's gonna lecture me on how
plastic bags are killing our planet

1290
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,238
like I'm the asshole
who invented plastic.

1291
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:02,174
We call her the "Oh, wait.
I have a coupon" lady

1292
01:06:02,241 --> 01:06:06,145
'cause she only remembers she has a
coupon in her hand after she's paid.

1293
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,215
We call him "Mr. Bullshit" 'cause he
makes you check in the back for stuff.

1294
01:06:09,281 --> 01:06:14,153
And every time we tell him we're out,
he always screams out, "Bullshit!" Yeah.

1295
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,123
Well, I guess that's it.
Hope it helps.

1296
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:19,692
Oh, wait.
We do have one other cashier.

1297
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:22,695
I call her
the "Crazy Coupon Lady."

1298
01:06:22,762 --> 01:06:25,197
Got this smile
plastered across her face,

1299
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:28,300
ridiculous amount of coupons
in her hand every time.

1300
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:32,405
And, of course, everybody's backed
up, waiting, waiting, waiting.

1301
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:36,575
And they're getting pissed
at me. At me! [chuckles]

1302
01:06:36,642 --> 01:06:38,210
- And the worst part...
- Okay.

1303
01:06:38,277 --> 01:06:40,713
...she had this fucking
catchphrase, okay,

1304
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,750
this little saying she would spew
at me every time before she left.

1305
01:06:44,817 --> 01:06:46,519
"Watch the pennies,

1306
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,354
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah." And I'm like...

1307
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,456
I'm sorry, I gotta
back you up there.

1308
01:06:50,523 --> 01:06:52,458
Did you say...
Was the phrase,

1309
01:06:52,525 --> 01:06:56,162
"Watch the pennies, and then the
dollars will take care of themselves"?

1310
01:06:56,796 --> 01:06:59,098
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it.

1311
01:06:59,165 --> 01:07:01,467
Okay, we're connecting then now.
We're connecting here.

1312
01:07:01,534 --> 01:07:04,203
So let me ask you this. What is her name?
What is this woman's name?

1313
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,805
I don't know her name, man.
I fucking hate her.

1314
01:07:05,871 --> 01:07:08,207
But you've done the transactions.
You see the card.

1315
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,743
- I'm sure you got her name, right?
- Crazy Coupon Lady.

1316
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,646
- Description. What does she look like?
- She's, like, three feet tall.

1317
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:15,281
- Call a sketch artist!
- Okay.

1318
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:17,216
We gotta have somebody
down here.

1319
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:19,185
Can you stay there
for a second?

1320
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:21,554
Ken, Ken. I'd like to talk
to you for just a minute.

1321
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,656
This is good.
Don't forget the...

1322
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:25,424
- Remember where we were at.
- Come on. Let's go.

1323
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:27,226
You can't be
screaming at him.

1324
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,495
What did you scream at the
guy, "Call a sketch artist"?

1325
01:07:29,562 --> 01:07:32,465
- Yeah, I...
- Who do you think she is, Keyser Söze?

1326
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:34,467
Ken, just take it
down a notch.

1327
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:38,571
- Slow it all down. Okay?
- I'm slowing it down,

1328
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:42,475
and I'm going to slowly tell
you exactly what happened there.

1329
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:46,712
He gave us the seed that's gonna
become the fucking branches, okay?

1330
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:48,481
- That lady, that's the gal.
- What does it...

1331
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:50,749
That's the gal! That phrase.
Did you not hear it?

1332
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:53,853
"Watch the pennies. Dollars take
care of themselves." That's...

1333
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:58,624
I mean, that is literally plastered
on the Savvy Super Saver website.

1334
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:03,496
Okay. Well, that is interesting.
That's helpful.

1335
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,767
And did you know that
your average shopper

1336
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:13,506
travels 2.27 miles to their
nearest local grocery store?

1337
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:16,609
- Is that true? Are you right about that?
- Yeah. That's a fact.

1338
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,612
If you are, that means our haystack
just went from 5,000 square miles

1339
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,814
- down to a two-mile radius...
- We're shrinking it.

1340
01:08:21,881 --> 01:08:24,283
...and we should get boots
on the ground. Look at me.

1341
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,384
[sighs]

1342
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:28,587
- That's good, Ken. That's great.
- [sighs] Thanks.

1343
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:30,556
Now do it without
the screaming, okay?

1344
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,825
It's just passion.
I'm a passionate man.

1345
01:08:32,892 --> 01:08:34,793
You can be passionate
without being an idiot.

1346
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:36,595
[camera clicking]

1347
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,200
Whew.

1348
01:08:41,267 --> 01:08:43,536
- [JoJo] Hey.
- Hi.

1349
01:08:43,602 --> 01:08:45,271
Ugh, girl, eBay is a bust.

1350
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:47,540
It's just too much.
I can't sell it fast enough.

1351
01:08:47,606 --> 01:08:51,277
What are we gonna do? It's not like we
can have a yard sale for all this shit.

1352
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,849
[chattering]

1353
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,585
We are investigating
a counterfeit coupon ring

1354
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:03,222
that we believe is operating
somewhere within your postal routes.

1355
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:05,758
Now, the mail that's being
picked up is primarily envelopes

1356
01:09:05,824 --> 01:09:09,628
with a Kansas return address
and marked "Savvy Super Saver."

1357
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:14,266
Suspect is a Caucasian female,
late 30s, approximately 5'1".

1358
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:18,637
One witness described her as overly
cheerful with a superiority complex.

1359
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:21,907
She may or may not
have accomplices.

1360
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:25,878
Hey, Earl, what about that gal
you won't stop blabbing about?

1361
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:28,781
Um, not sure I know
what he's talking about.

1362
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:31,584
You know, the girl.
She makes all these coupon videos.

1363
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,419
I'm sorry.
Did you say "coupon videos"?

1364
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:36,822
[chuckles] I don't know
nothing about nobody, uh...

1365
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:39,592
The girl. Yeah, she lives over
on, uh, Clayton Avenue.

1366
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:43,395
What's her name? Uh, Coco? JoJo?
It's JoJo, right? Or is it Coco?

1367
01:09:43,462 --> 01:09:46,665
Hold on. You said she's Caucasian?
Whoopsie-daisy. Never mind.

1368
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:50,269
She's a Black gal.
A Black woman. Lady. So...

1369
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,539
Oh, shit. Look.
These open carry dudes.

1370
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,807
[woman]
Hi. Do you have oat milk?

1371
01:09:54,873 --> 01:09:56,442
[barista]
Oat milk is over there.

1372
01:09:56,508 --> 01:09:58,711
- [sighs]
- Oh. Maybe they want to buy our guns?

1373
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:01,847
- [barista] Morning. What can I get for you two?
- [man 1] Hey, what's up, baby?

1374
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:05,651
- Let me grab a skinny caramel macchiato.
- [JoJo whispering] Connie.

1375
01:10:05,718 --> 01:10:08,954
- [man 2] Large coffee. Black.
- [whispering] What are you doing?

1376
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:10,789
- Mmm.
- [JoJo sighs]

1377
01:10:10,856 --> 01:10:12,324
Nice.

1378
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:16,996
Couldn't help but notice. Are you
fellas part of some sort of gun club?

1379
01:10:17,062 --> 01:10:19,498
Just practicing
our right to bear arms...

1380
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:21,500
- Oh, okay.
- ...while we pick up coffee.

1381
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:25,738
- I got two macchiatos for Stephanie.
- Oh, that's me.

1382
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:27,940
- Stephanie. Hiya. And you are?
- Hey.

1383
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:29,408
I'm Rattlesnake.

1384
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:31,677
That's catchy.
Rattlesnake.

1385
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:33,712
- Sandman.
- That's a good one too.

1386
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:37,750
Hey, I was wondering...

1387
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,051
We don't know where we're going.
We don't know who these people are.

1388
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:41,654
Yes, we do.
He dropped me a pin.

1389
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,555
- Oh, he dropped you a pin.
- Yeah.

1390
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:46,058
- So we know... We're good now. That's it.
- JoJo.

1391
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:49,028
What do you want me to say? It's not
like we can have a yard sale, okay?

1392
01:10:49,094 --> 01:10:52,031
And you just do what you do on your
sales calls, like you taught me.

1393
01:10:52,097 --> 01:10:53,732
You make the customer
the hero.

1394
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:55,401
- The hero?
- Yeah.

1395
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:57,936
These guys could be KKK,
Aryan Brotherhood, anything.

1396
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,039
[grunts] And you want me
to make them the heroes?

1397
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:04,076
I highly doubt that, okay?
Did you see what Rattlesnake ordered?

1398
01:11:04,143 --> 01:11:06,779
A caramel macchiato
doesn't sound very KKK to me.

1399
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:10,315
Am I in any kind
of trouble here, or...

1400
01:11:11,116 --> 01:11:14,053
Well, it's kind of
up to you, Earl.

1401
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:16,088
You gonna dance
with the tiger?

1402
01:11:17,056 --> 01:11:19,525
- You gonna play some ball?
- I'm sorry...

1403
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,661
I'm not quite sure who the tiger is that
someone would be dancing with, Earl.

1404
01:11:22,728 --> 01:11:24,530
- Are you? [chuckles]
- [chuckles] No, sir.

1405
01:11:24,596 --> 01:11:26,398
- It's about cooperation.
- Do you mind if I call you Earl?

1406
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:27,866
Oh, no. No problem.

1407
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:30,402
Earl, how long have you been
with the post office?

1408
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:33,539
- Oh, well, it's going on eleven years now.
- Eleven years.

1409
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:35,074
And have you had
the same route for most of it?

1410
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,942
Oh, yes, sir.
That's how I like it.

1411
01:11:37,009 --> 01:11:40,045
Okay. And probably getting pretty
close to your pension here?

1412
01:11:40,112 --> 01:11:41,680
Oh, you bet. Yes.

1413
01:11:41,747 --> 01:11:43,849
Who's the Earl, girl?

1414
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,017
[grunts]

1415
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,655
- Who's the girl, Earl?
- Whoa, am I under arrest here?

1416
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,825
No, you're not under arrest.
God, that was loud. It scared me too.

1417
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,426
But we need some answers.

1418
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:57,396
The guy out there is
talking about coupon videos.

1419
01:11:57,463 --> 01:11:59,665
You seem to not know
a darn thing about it.

1420
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,468
That had nothing to...
I don't know what he was talking about.

1421
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:05,704
You might want to talk to Adam,
'cause I have no idea about any girl...

1422
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:07,840
- Adam. What's his last name?
- Phillips.

1423
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,842
Adam Phil... Two L's?

1424
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,744
You're not giving me
enough here!

1425
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:13,879
I think it's pretty clear that
Earl doesn't know anything.

1426
01:12:13,946 --> 01:12:16,582
I think your coworker must have
got his signals crossed somehow.

1427
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:19,985
- Yes, sir.
- Unfortunately, there is one kind

1428
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:22,154
of uncomfortable question
pertaining to this.

1429
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:23,522
Yes, sir.

1430
01:12:25,057 --> 01:12:26,725
Have you ever danced
with a tiger?

1431
01:12:26,792 --> 01:12:28,761
[both laugh]

1432
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:30,162
It was his joke.
It wasn't...

1433
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:32,898
- Tiger dance.
- What are you... Don't dance.

1434
01:12:32,965 --> 01:12:34,933
Anyway, thank you so much.
I appreciate you.

1435
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,002
- Sure thing. No problem.
- Sorry about the confusion.

1436
01:12:37,069 --> 01:12:39,338
- Oh, no. It's cool.
- Have a good time out there.

1437
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:46,879
The hell was that?
I had him on the ropes.

1438
01:12:46,945 --> 01:12:48,947
Screaming at somebody doesn't
make 'em tell you the truth.

1439
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:51,450
He could've been sweating bullets.
I had him bent, man.

1440
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:53,786
Let's agree to disagree.
We're gonna go for a ride.

1441
01:13:04,496 --> 01:13:05,664
[Mama Josie] Hey, Earl!

1442
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:08,634
Oh, hey! [chuckles]

1443
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,736
There you go. Yeah.

1444
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,472
Uh, that top one right there for JoJo
is real, real important, Ms. Johnson.

1445
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,108
Oh, that girl
been up to something.

1446
01:13:16,175 --> 01:13:18,777
You just gotta promise that she
get that letter, Ms. Johnson.

1447
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:21,847
Oh, yeah, yeah, you the mailman.
Now, I get how this shit works.

1448
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:24,950
[stammers]

1449
01:13:26,919 --> 01:13:28,887
[Ken] Yeah,
I don't know about that interaction.

1450
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:31,156
And now
he's just standing there.

1451
01:13:31,223 --> 01:13:35,127
The DMV database lists
two names at 1579 Clayton.

1452
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:37,830
Josephine Johnson,
60 years of age,

1453
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:40,566
and Joanna Johnson,
33 years of age.

1454
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:42,134
Joanna Johnson.

1455
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:43,202
[rumbling]

1456
01:13:43,268 --> 01:13:44,970
The fuck's that sound?

1457
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:49,241
It's 120 degrees.
Car's overheating, and the fan's dying.

1458
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:53,679
Go ahead. Roll down your windows,
and, uh, I gotta kill the engine here.

1459
01:13:53,745 --> 01:13:56,081
[sighs] That's no good.

1460
01:13:57,616 --> 01:13:59,751
Ooh. Okay.

1461
01:14:00,786 --> 01:14:06,191
Joanna Johnson.
Joanna John... JJ. Jo...

1462
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:08,894
Oh! JoJo?

1463
01:14:08,961 --> 01:14:12,664
We must be crazy. Oh, my God.

African-American woman going on and on."

01:31:01,973 --> 01:31:05,276
I think you understand this
woman more than I do, so yeah.

1791
01:31:08,045 --> 01:31:09,780
Okay.

1792
01:31:25,329 --> 01:31:26,864
Connie, this is Ken Miller.

1793
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:28,866
This is the, uh,
loss prevention officer

1794
01:31:28,933 --> 01:31:32,003
that was pivotal
in tracking you down.

1795
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:35,873
- For starters, let's talk coupons.
- [Connie] Okay.

1796
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,277
What do you wanna know?

1797
01:31:39,343 --> 01:31:42,280
I mean, most people
undervalue coupons.

1798
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:45,082
I don't undervalue coupons.

1799
01:31:45,816 --> 01:31:48,886
No. I guess you don't.

1800
01:31:48,953 --> 01:31:51,155
I suppose that's why I'm here.

1801
01:31:51,222 --> 01:31:53,024
But, you know, most people do.

1802
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:57,295
Well, here's what I think.
I think you preyed on people.

1803
01:31:57,361 --> 01:32:02,667
I think nobody understands better than
you that people use coupons to save money

1804
01:32:02,733 --> 01:32:05,803
or to buy things that they need,
and I think you took advantage of that.

1805
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:08,039
No. No, you're wrong.

1806
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:09,774
Tell me how I'm wrong.

1807
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,642
- That's not really why...
- That's not what...

1808
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:14,211
That's not really why people
use coupons. [chuckles]

1809
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:18,916
It's not about what you buy.
It's about the, uh... the feeling you get.

1810
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:20,952
They've done studies.

1811
01:32:21,018 --> 01:32:23,788
When folks use coupons,
their oxytocin levels,

1812
01:32:23,854 --> 01:32:27,325
they kinda spike and they get
that little tingly sensation.

1813
01:32:27,391 --> 01:32:29,894
They call it
the "coupon high."

1814
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:34,832
Supposedly, it's better than intimacy
with another person, or so I've been told.

1815
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:39,370
Sorry, I... I'm unclear.
Did you...

1816
01:32:39,437 --> 01:32:42,139
Have you not used a coupon
or have you not had sex?

1817
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,109
T... What happened?

1818
01:32:45,176 --> 01:32:49,613
No, that's... [stammers] Oh, no.
This is not about me. This is about you.

1819
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:53,050
You... you had...
You had a good life, Connie.

1820
01:32:53,117 --> 01:32:56,087
You had the nice house
and loving husband.

1821
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,389
Wha... Why... Why would you risk
losing all of that?

1822
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,396
I knew I was worth more.

1823
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:07,131
And what do you know
about my life?

1824
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:09,400
Just 'cause you've watched me
from a distance

1825
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:11,702
does not mean
you really know me.

1826
01:33:12,737 --> 01:33:15,706
You happy with the life
that you're living?

1827
01:33:15,773 --> 01:33:18,809
Haven't you ever wanted just
a little bit more out of life?

1828
01:33:21,312 --> 01:33:23,848
[sighs] Maybe we just value
different things.

1829
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:28,052
Well, I'll tell you what I value, Connie.
I value the law.

1830
01:33:28,119 --> 01:33:30,654
Just because you want
a little more out of life

1831
01:33:30,721 --> 01:33:33,124
does not give you an excuse
to break those laws.

1832
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,960
Now, it is not my job
to judge you.

1833
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,062
[chuckling] And you seem
like a nice enough lady.

1834
01:33:38,129 --> 01:33:40,231
But I want to make sure
that you are grasping

1835
01:33:40,297 --> 01:33:43,000
the gravity of the situation
that you're in.

1836
01:33:43,067 --> 01:33:47,104
It is one year
for every $100,000 of fraud.

1837
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:50,674
So, with what you've stolen,
your sentencing is off the charts.

1838
01:33:50,741 --> 01:33:53,811
You are facing
40 years to life.

1839
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:55,813
What?

1840
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:00,217
- Uh...
- Thank you.

1841
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:09,460
You should, uh, probably get
yourself a really good lawyer.

1842
01:34:09,527 --> 01:34:13,230
And if I were you, I would
pay full price for this one.

1843
01:34:17,101 --> 01:34:18,102
[door closes]

1844
01:34:22,106 --> 01:34:24,008
[crying, sniffles]

1845
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:25,709
[Connie]
<i>They said 40 years to life.</i>

1846
01:34:26,844 --> 01:34:28,813
Forty years to life?

1847
01:34:28,879 --> 01:34:32,917
But they said that if I took full
responsibility for starting all of it,

1848
01:34:32,983 --> 01:34:34,218
they would go easy on you.

1849
01:34:34,285 --> 01:34:36,120
No, Connie.
What about you?

1850
01:34:36,187 --> 01:34:38,856
I'm up a creek either way.
It doesn't...

1851
01:34:40,124 --> 01:34:41,926
I did rope you into it,

1852
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:45,262
and if I can make it easier
on you, then...

1853
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:47,798
Can you believe they are
calling what we did fraud?

1854
01:34:47,865 --> 01:34:49,500
I know, that's so stup...

1855
01:34:49,567 --> 01:34:51,735
- It's like, we didn't defraud anybody.
- No.

1856
01:34:52,903 --> 01:34:55,473
- Now, theft... Maybe. A little.
- Maybe theft. Maybe.

1857
01:34:55,539 --> 01:34:57,141
[guard] Joanna Johnson?

1858
01:34:57,208 --> 01:34:58,476
That's me. Hi.

1859
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:00,277
You made bail.
Let's go.

1860
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,348
Mama Josie.

1861
01:35:05,983 --> 01:35:09,520
- [chattering]
- [gate buzzes]

1862
01:35:09,587 --> 01:35:11,722
- [guard] Connie Kaminski?
- Ooh! That's me!

1863
01:35:13,891 --> 01:35:16,160
- I made bail too?
- No. You got a visitor.

1864
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:21,832
What the fuck, Connie?

1865
01:35:23,434 --> 01:35:25,503
I told you
that I stopped using coupons.

1866
01:35:25,569 --> 01:35:28,539
I just didn't tell you
that I started selling them.

1867
01:35:28,606 --> 01:35:30,274
Look, it's a good job.

1868
01:35:30,341 --> 01:35:31,976
It's not a job!

1869
01:35:32,042 --> 01:35:34,411
Would you...
Would you just bail me out?

1870
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:36,514
Oh, you don't have
a coupon for that?

1871
01:35:40,017 --> 01:35:42,086
Rick, next time
you walk into a room

1872
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,321
and you think everyone there
is sorry to see you,

1873
01:35:44,388 --> 01:35:46,257
just know it's not 'cause
you're an auditor.

1874
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:48,392
It's 'cause you're an asshole.

1875
01:35:49,426 --> 01:35:51,328
I'd like a divorce.

1876
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:57,368
[scoffs]

1877
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,008
[sighs]

1878
01:36:09,914 --> 01:36:11,515
[birds twittering]

1879
01:36:12,316 --> 01:36:13,517
Earl?

1880
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:16,187
- Hey!
- Hey.

1881
01:36:16,253 --> 01:36:18,455
- [whispers] These are for you.
- I... Oh, thank you.

1882
01:36:18,522 --> 01:36:20,524
I thought you
were my mama, so...

1883
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:23,928
Yeah, well, I think your mama's
cooperating with the authorities.

1884
01:36:24,595 --> 01:36:26,997
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

1885
01:36:27,064 --> 01:36:30,067
- Well, thank you. This is nice.
- You're welcome.

1886
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:32,536
How you doing?

1887
01:36:32,603 --> 01:36:36,407
- Um... [sighs] I'm doing. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1888
01:36:36,473 --> 01:36:38,042
Better days.

1889
01:36:38,108 --> 01:36:39,610
Just got the official tally.

1890
01:36:39,677 --> 01:36:43,180
Over 40 million dollars' worth
of counterfeit coupons.

1891
01:36:43,247 --> 01:36:45,216
We traced it back
to a facility in Mexico,

1892
01:36:45,282 --> 01:36:47,618
a US company
called Advanced Solutions.

1893
01:36:47,685 --> 01:36:50,087
It's the same place that makes
the real coupons, yeah.

1894
01:36:50,154 --> 01:36:52,189
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Used to be up in Michigan.

1895
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:55,960
Moved down to Mexico to save some money.
They got a factory overseas too.

1896
01:36:56,026 --> 01:36:57,628
We know who their
Mexican counterparts were?

1897
01:36:57,695 --> 01:37:00,431
Uh, yeah.
Advanced Solutions employees

1898
01:37:00,497 --> 01:37:03,200
Alejandro and Rosa Diaz,
husband and wife.

1899
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:06,637
[Park] <i>One of Kaminski's
aliases would wire money orders</i>

1900
01:37:06,704 --> 01:37:10,541
<i>totaling well over a million
dollars, and that's a lot of pesos.</i>

1901
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:12,376
Mexican government
gonna pursue 'em?

1902
01:37:12,443 --> 01:37:14,245
Nope.
Trail's gone cold.

1903
01:37:14,311 --> 01:37:16,981
Uh, when news of the arrests
broke, these two disappeared.

1904
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:19,883
They're probably sitting on a
beach somewhere drinking mai tais.

1905
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:22,987
[Connie narrating] <i>My lawyer,
this super expensive fella,</i>

1906
01:37:23,053 --> 01:37:25,155
<i>sure had an interesting way
of looking at things.</i>

1907
01:37:25,222 --> 01:37:27,992
All you did was take
advantage of a loophole.

1908
01:37:28,058 --> 01:37:31,428
These corporations you're accused of
exploiting use loopholes all the time

1909
01:37:31,495 --> 01:37:33,197
and take advantage
of a broken system.

1910
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,132
<i>He always liked to say...</i>

1911
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,002
Just because someone says
something, doesn't make it true.

1912
01:37:38,068 --> 01:37:40,170
<i>The funny thing is,
whenever he said it,</i>

1913
01:37:40,237 --> 01:37:42,406
<i>most everyone
took it to be fact.</i>

1914
01:37:42,473 --> 01:37:47,911
My client is just following the
lead of a successful corporation.

1915
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:50,247
Will the defendants
please rise?

1916
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:56,053
Through all this,
I've learned more about coupons

1917
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:59,256
and America's shopping habits
than I ever cared to know.

1918
01:37:59,323 --> 01:38:04,628
The court has considered the nature
and circumstances of the offense

1919
01:38:04,695 --> 01:38:09,500
in arriving at a sentence for Ms.
Johnson and Mrs. Kaminski.

1920
01:38:11,235 --> 01:38:14,071
The court sentences
the defendant Joanna Johnson

1921
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:19,043
to ten days in jail suspended
and one-year probation.

1922
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:20,377
[people murmuring]

1923
01:38:20,444 --> 01:38:23,347
As for the defendant,
Connie Kaminski,

1924
01:38:23,414 --> 01:38:27,418
she will be incarcerated in the
Arizona Department of Corrections

1925
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:32,690
for a term of 11 months,
with the possibility of parole.

1926
01:38:32,756 --> 01:38:34,725
- [judge] That's all.
- [gavel thuds]

1927
01:38:34,792 --> 01:38:36,026
[JoJo] Oh, my G...

1928
01:38:36,627 --> 01:38:38,128
Well, lookee there.

1929
01:38:38,195 --> 01:38:40,964
First time in history
a Black woman gets off

1930
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:43,734
and a white woman gets to do
some time. [snickers]

1931
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:46,036
[Connie] <i>That loss
prevention guy was right.</i>

1932
01:38:46,103 --> 01:38:47,738
<i>You get what you pay for.</i>

1933
01:38:47,805 --> 01:38:49,573
<i>Not 40 years to life. Just...</i>

1934
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,142
Eleven fucking months!

1935
01:38:52,209 --> 01:38:55,245
All right. Look,
you didn't hear this from me,

1936
01:38:55,312 --> 01:38:59,416
but we may have received multiple
phone calls from numerous corporations,

1937
01:38:59,483 --> 01:39:02,086
saying, you know, uh,
"We don't want our logo on the news.

1938
01:39:02,152 --> 01:39:04,021
- Our shareholders... Keep it quiet."
- [sighs] Oh, God.

1939
01:39:04,088 --> 01:39:06,323
Bottom line, they just
want this to go away.

1940
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,559
The damage she's done, we're gonna
throw the rules out the window?

1941
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:12,329
They don't matter?
She cost P&G alone $80 million.

1942
01:39:12,396 --> 01:39:15,466
For P&G and for every other
company, this was just a write-off.

1943
01:39:15,532 --> 01:39:18,068
And, uh, it'll probably be
eight with good behavior.

1944
01:39:18,135 --> 01:39:19,770
Oh, God.

1945
01:39:19,837 --> 01:39:22,740
Oh, my God.
I-I just... I don't get it.

1946
01:39:22,806 --> 01:39:26,310
So, uh, you're telling me that's it?
Move on, it's over?

1947
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:28,379
Well, that's all there is.
That's law enforcement.

1948
01:39:28,445 --> 01:39:31,782
You just do the best that you can, Ken.
You try to be fair.

1949
01:39:31,849 --> 01:39:35,652
You follow the law and if everything
goes well, you get to go home safe,

1950
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:39,256
and hopefully to someone
that you love. [chuckles]

1951

"My dearest Leo,
when word arrived from Pastor Holbrook

that your injuries
were not life-threatening,

1960
01:40:11,655 --> 01:40:14,491
and that you were on your way
back home to us,

1961
01:40:14,558 --> 01:40:16,693
my heart leapt from my chest.

1962
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:22,433
Our little Irene could not decipher
my tears as those of pure joy.

1963
01:40:22,499 --> 01:40:26,603
My only hope now is that you receive
this letter before you depart,

1964
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:29,840
and that my words
will accompany you

1965
01:40:29,907 --> 01:40:31,809
on your arduous journey
back home.

1966
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:35,479

faith and love. Mary."

1969

Oh... Not the letter.
[stammers] You can't separate the letters.

1970

What good would the letters be
if they weren't together?

1971
01:40:49,893 --> 01:40:51,728
- Right.
- The letters are kind of archival.

1972
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:54,198
What I mean is that
this lesson is for you.

1973
01:40:55,265 --> 01:40:57,301
- The lesson's for you, Ken.
- [chuckles]

1974
01:40:57,935 --> 01:40:59,636
You're a good man.

1975
01:40:59,703 --> 01:41:01,538
I enjoyed working
alongside you.

1976
01:41:03,707 --> 01:41:06,643
Don't go searching for too much.
You're pretty great the way you are.

Yeah. Give her a discount.
