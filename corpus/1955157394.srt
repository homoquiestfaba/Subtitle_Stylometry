1
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:43,610
I love you.

2
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,245
Yeah, same same!

3
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,646
Stop saying that!

4
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:48,114
Why, it's true.

5
00:00:48,147 --> 00:00:49,583
It doesn't sound real.

6
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,584
It's real.

7
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:52,385
How do you know for sure?

8
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:54,419
Because I feel it!

9
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:57,123
Then say it, say
it to me properly.

10
00:00:59,257 --> 00:01:01,126
Okay, I love you.

11
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,064
Is he ready?

12
00:04:59,797 --> 00:05:00,632
Get down, get down!

13
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,669
Don't move.

14
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,838
Or I'll blow your head off.

15
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,511
Remember.

16
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,783
Remember, remember...

17
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,319
Get him!

18
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:24,884
Go!

19
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:53,840
Hey, no ticket!

20
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:55,908
You give me the money, money!

21
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,476
I don't have any money!

22
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,744
Money, money, money, money!

23
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:00,412
There, there's your ticket.

24
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:04,816
Go come on, go!

25
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,321
Go!

26
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:22,634
Go!

27
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,414
Damn it!

28
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:36,015
Go on, move!

29
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:51,056
Hey, hey!

30
00:09:51,622 --> 00:09:52,758
Over here.

31
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,026
How are you feeling?

32
00:09:58,729 --> 00:09:59,998
Come and find me.

33
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:01,666
Find you?

34
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,838
You'll know where to look.

35
00:10:40,572 --> 00:10:43,742
Pharmaceuticals is a
risky market, Michael.

36
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:45,877
Especially in the current
financial climate.

37
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,880
I beg your pardon?

38
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,849
Alan Williams, United Kingdom
Foreign & Commonwealth

39
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:51,850
Office.

40
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,218
We'd like to have a chat.

41
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:55,687
Then call my secretary.

42
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,623
I have a morning
meeting to prepare for.

43
00:10:57,655 --> 00:10:58,991
A meeting?

44
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,260
To discuss your
company's disappointing

45
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,229
last quarter losses?

46
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,964
Who the hell
have you been talking to?

47
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:15,840
We know about your
research facility in Asia.

48
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,810
What of it, that facility
isn't doing anything illegal.

49
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:21,780
Clinical opportunities
in emerging markets?

50
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:25,718
Like it or not, we operate
within all local laws.

51
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,821
Michael, if the public
knew you were using

52
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,857
an offshore lab to
conduct clinical trials

53
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:33,992
on the poor!

54
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:38,064
I hardly think the
legal position matters.

55
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,800
Mister, what was it?

56
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,734
Williams.

57
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:46,237
Don't you guys have terrorists
to catch or wars to start

58
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:50,275
or something, instead
of harassing taxpayers?

59
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:54,146
So you want to
shut us down?

60
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,083
Actually, we'd like
to offer you a contract.

61
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:01,219
But it would be
good for you to know

62
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:02,720
where we stand.

63
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,523
A contract for what?

64
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:07,025
There is a product we
would like you to develop

65
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,294
for us.

66
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,076
We'll be in touch.

67
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,048
By the way.

68
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:31,050
You will need to
improve the security

69
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,252
at that laboratory, good day.

70
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,798
Get down, get down!

71
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,368
Don't move.

72
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,069
Don't move.

73
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:26,771
Or I'll blow your head off.

74
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,144
Remember.

75
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,317
Remember, remember...

76
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:40,852
Get him!

77
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:46,951
Where the hell did he go?

78
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,119
This way!

79
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,034
It should be quiet today.

80
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,836
Yeah.

81
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:10,569
Drop your weapons
and stand down.

82
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,505
Don't even think about it.

83
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,876
I don't give a damn
what else is going on.

84
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:20,078
I'm only here for him, get him.

85
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:22,948
Don't move.

86
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,131
What's that?

87
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,103
Get back.

88
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,838
Yeah.

89
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:53,538
Hey man, this
is my father's restaurant!

90
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,112
Then
tell him it's closed.

91
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,550
Keep
quiet, he's coming.

92
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:07,653
Don't
worry, I know kung fu.

93
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:38,417
He's on the roof!

94
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:46,524
Hey asshole, watch the ride.

95
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,362
Alex, what are you doing here?

96
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,629
Alex, then you know me?

97
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:27,566
What, you can't be serious.

98
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:29,166
You disappear for a month,

99
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,702
and you think you can just
show up outta nowhere?

100
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,472
I'm sorry, but do you know me?

101
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,309
Of course I know you,
what's wrong with you?

102
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,745
I really need your help.

103
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,482
Please.

104
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:44,515
Come on.

105
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,184
Can you cover for me?

106
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:47,084
Yeah.

107
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,425
So, where have you been?

108
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:55,026
I don't know, I just...

109
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:56,560
People are chasing me.

110
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,264
What people Alex,
what's going on?

111
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:02,601
Military or something, I
don't remember anything clearly.

112
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,703
Military, what on earth
have you gotten yourself

113
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,070
mixed up with?

114
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,673
I don't know, I don't
know anything, okay?

115
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,475
But they're gonna kill me.

116
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:14,378
Calm down, it's gonna be okay,

117
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:15,780
we'll work it all out.

118
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,151
Here, go to my room, 406,

119
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,551
I'll meet you up in a bit.

120
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,128
Yes, Dr. Garideb?

121
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,698
Do you have the file?

122
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,268
Great, yes meet me downstairs.

123
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,668
Okay.

124
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:44,709
Until what?

125
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:47,512
Hey.

126
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,715
How are you feeling?

127
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,519
All messed up,
like I'm drowning

128
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,722
in a sea full of oxygen.

129
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:59,790
Well at least no one's
come looking for you.

130
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:01,358
I think you're safe here.

131
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:16,875
We'd like your
help with locating

132
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,676
one of our missing patients.

133
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,381
We know he's in the area, and
is very confused right now.

134
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,818
And why do you
think he'd be here?

135
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,619
We're just taking
precautionary measures.

136
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,655
Letting people know
to look out for him.

137
00:21:30,687 --> 00:21:32,723
Everyone's safety is
our primary concern.

138
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,727
Is he dangerous?

139
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,829
Dangerous, yes.

140
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,865
He's a delusional schizophrenic.

141
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,599
He escaped from
a secure facility

142
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,768
earlier this morning, he
has actually assaulted

143
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,636
several people already.

144
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,606
Well,

145
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,841
I've never even
met the guy before.

146
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,776
Yes, I'm sure.

147
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,744
Nevertheless, if you do see him,

148
00:21:53,778 --> 00:21:55,413
don't approach him.

149
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:58,482
Or talk to him, because
you might say one thing,

150
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:00,885
and he might hear something
entirely different.

151
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:02,753
You don't know what
kinds of crazy things

152
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:04,756
these people can
get in their heads.

153
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:05,824
Just call us.

154
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,126
Can I see some ID please?

155
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,828
Yes, of course.

156
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:15,199
Dr. Garideb?

157
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:18,136
Garideb yes, and
this is Dr. Parsons.

158
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,705
Prevara, I've
never heard of it.

159
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:22,607
It's on the outskirts of town.

160
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:23,941
As you can imagine,
our patients require

161
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:26,544
a certain amount of isolation.

162
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,248
Well, if I see or hear
anything I'll be sure

163
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:32,518
to let you know.

164
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,821
You cut yourself.

165
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,223
Yeah, I'm such a klutz,

166
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,626
I was cutting vegetables.

167
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:43,928
You should really be
more careful next time.

168
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:46,798
Have a good day.

169
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,409
Who are you?

170
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,713
Jane, your girlfriend.

171
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:04,883
Well, ex-girlfriend.

172
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,352
Who am I?

173
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,755
What the hell have
they done to you?

174
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,491
Wait, this is yours.

175
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:19,463
A memberships for
a place called Jaika.

176
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,769
Jane we don't have much time.

177
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,340
You know where he is

178
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,309
Tell me where he is.

179
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:32,578
Okay...

180
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:35,646
Wait here.

181
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,757
Can I help you please?

182
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,460
This is a residential area.

183
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:03,808
Get out!

184
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,909
Where is he?

185
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:44,376
Hey.

186
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,677
Thanks for that.

187
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,713
It was really, sweet.

188
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,081
What's happening?

189
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,483
I don't know.

190
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,553
But we need answers.

191
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:55,853
Find them.

192
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,757
Where do I look?

193
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,727
We have a clue.

194
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,028
The doctors?

195
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,730
They're not real doctors.

196
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:06,831
So that was all a lie?

197
00:26:07,531 --> 00:26:08,699
A part of the truth.

198
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,703
There was
something else.

199
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,639
My arm.

200
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:17,475
Are you in pain?

201
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:18,876
Yeah.

202
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,748
Yes, I am.

203
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:35,553
Check her out.

204
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:37,856
Hey sexy, where are you going?

205
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:39,457
My house is that way.

206
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,793
I've got this, I've got...

207
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,030
Save your breath,
you'll need it later

208
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:48,165
to blow up your doll.

209
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:19,030
Hey, what's going on?

210
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,770
Are you all right?

211
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,885
What are you doing out
at this time anyway?

212
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,020
Did you go to a nightclub?

213
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,987
No, I waitress
just down the road.

214
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,723
That's good to know.

215
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:46,925
I didn't think you
had any friends.

216
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,561
Stop it, and
there was I thinking

217
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,062
you were such a nice guy.

218
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,730
I normally get a lift back.

219
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:53,865
Boyfriend?

220
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:55,934
Yeah, he's amazing actually.

221
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:59,036
Tall, strong, handsome.

222
00:28:59,069 --> 00:28:59,971
All right.

223
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:00,838
Good at ducking.

224
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:04,642
And sometimes his
boyfriend picks me up.

225
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,044
They're my flatmates.

226
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:11,982
We should go from this place.

227
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:13,952
Those guys will be back.

228
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:15,752
You're probably right.

229
00:29:15,786 --> 00:29:16,888
Let me drop you home.

230
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:49,287
Get down, get down!

231
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:52,122
Don't move.

232
00:29:52,155 --> 00:29:53,724
Or I'll blow your head off.

233
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:56,360
Remember.

234
00:29:58,828 --> 00:29:59,963
Remember, remember...

235
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:01,732
Get him!

236
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:05,664
Put it down.

237
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,564
Or you're dead.

238
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,898
Out of the way.

239
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:08,892
Get him!

240
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:26,376
Goddammit, he's gone!

241
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:27,845
He can't escape.

242
00:32:27,877 --> 00:32:29,213
Come on!

243
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,521
Alex, I thought that was you.

244
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,155
What was that chasing about.

245
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:14,492
Kelly, I'm a
member here right?

246
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:16,359
Well you work here.

247
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:19,130
But it's been a month or
so since you went off.

248
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,498
Where do I live?

249
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:22,833
How the hell should I know?

250
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,970
The computer, what
address do you have for me?

251
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,006
Do you have your card?

252
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:44,856
Number 47, yeah, I
know where that is.

253
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,890
It's the road that
comes around the back.

254
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,425
With the derelict buildings.

255
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:51,361
What is wrong with you?

256
00:33:52,229 --> 00:33:53,331
Where's the back exit?

257
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,598
Over there.

258
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,345
Alex, what are you doing here?

259
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:08,446
I haven't seen you for a month.

260
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,580
Mate, buy me some time.

261
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:11,216
There are people chasing me.

262
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:14,918
He's gotta be
somewhere around here.

263
00:34:21,457 --> 00:34:23,861
Excuse
me, can I help you?

264
00:34:24,995 --> 00:34:26,364
There he is.

265
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,032
Hey buddy, I'm gonna
need to see some ID okay?

266
00:36:05,028 --> 00:36:06,496
What the hell?

267
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,666
Pre...

268
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:13,370
Prevara?

269
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,019
What does it mean?

270
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,754
We're getting closer.

271
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:31,688
To what?

272
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,058
The answers are at home.

273
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,095
I long, as does
every human being,

274
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,497
to be at home wherever
I find myself.

275
00:36:42,598 --> 00:36:43,767
Shut up.

276
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,126
Three months is a long time.

277
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,294
I'm gonna miss you like crazy.

278
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:12,729
I told you when
we started dating

279
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,766
that I'd have to go back
at the end of the summer.

280
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:17,667
My parents haven't
seen me in years.

281
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,736
What's it like out there?

282
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,705
It's smaller, less busy.

283
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:24,075
A lot hotter.

284
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:26,209
Why don't you come with me?

285
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:28,679
I can't just drop
everything and leave.

286
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:29,847
What about my job?

287
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:31,749
Working in the
gym is not a job.

288
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:33,283
There are gyms everywhere.

289
00:37:33,316 --> 00:37:34,684
We can find you one out there.

290
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:39,522
Well, I'm sure someone
will need protecting.

291
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:41,758
Defenseless, delicate
girl like yourself.

292
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,127
Really?

293
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:09,787
Get down, get down!

294
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:18,328
Don't move.

295
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,665
Or I'll blow your head off.

296
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:22,466
Remember.

297
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:23,533
Remember, remember...

298
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,304
Get him!

299
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,713
Come on, get up!

300
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:27,851
Hello?

301
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:30,653
Yeah, all right
I'll check it out.

302
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:24,068
What?

303
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:25,568
Hey Sam?

304
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,981
Commander, we've seen
something happening,

305
00:43:38,013 --> 00:43:39,482
now, come on!

306
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:00,631
Sounds like
you're out of luck.

307
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:05,836
I won't need bullets.

308
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,116
They're
dangerous people, Alex.

309
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:54,785
Why are they chasing me?

310
00:45:55,785 --> 00:45:56,720
I don't know.

311
00:45:57,586 --> 00:45:58,521
But why would a
team of armed guards

312
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,723
be chasing a lone guy
around a backwater town?

313
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:06,296
I have something they want.

314
00:46:06,896 --> 00:46:08,631
Or something they want back.

315
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:11,568
Why don't I remember anything?

316
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:15,772
Maybe that's a part of it.

317
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:16,265
Hi, I'm Manny.

318
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,336
You said you had some
news about my sister.

319
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:21,738
Have a seat.

320
00:47:23,872 --> 00:47:25,274
My name's Brink.

321
00:47:25,774 --> 00:47:28,244
I've been working as a
doctor at the local hospital.

322
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:32,116
Gathering information about
what's been happening there.

323
00:47:37,386 --> 00:47:38,856
So she was there?

324
00:47:43,158 --> 00:47:45,396
Three people were
brought in from a car crash.

325
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:50,900
Two guys, and a girl.

326
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:03,781
That must be her.

327
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:06,415
She's a taxi driver.

328
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,728
They're all in
pretty bad shape.

329
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,262
Unconscious.

330
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:21,231
But not life threatening.

331
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,934
They should've made
a full recovery.

332
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:25,769
I'm really worried.

333
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:27,771
First they told me that
she'd never been there,

334
00:48:27,803 --> 00:48:29,372
and then that she was dead.

335
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,076
I can't straight get
answers out of anybody.

336
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,912
I don't have all
the answers yet.

337
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:38,781
But I know where she is,

338
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:41,718
and who's responsible.

339
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:44,421
Where,
I need to see her.

340
00:48:44,453 --> 00:48:46,356
Don't worry,
we'll get her back.

341
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,158
We'll get them all back.

342
00:48:49,825 --> 00:48:51,160
It's gonna take some planning,

343
00:48:51,794 --> 00:48:52,896
and some time.

344
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:13,983
Get down, get down!

345
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:22,292
Don't move.

346
00:49:23,859 --> 00:49:25,162
Or I'll blow your head off.

347
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:26,830
Remember.

348
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:27,330
Remember, remember...

349
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:31,799
Get him!

350
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:21,644
Move it!

351
00:51:26,716 --> 00:51:27,617
A disturbance
has been reported

352
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:29,251
at the train market.

353
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:31,221
With sounds of possible gunfire.

354
00:51:31,687 --> 00:51:33,323
The suspect has fled the area,

355
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,124
and is believed to
be a Caucasian male,

356
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,928
mid-20s, wearing a gray overall.

357
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:45,561
Alex, my name is Brink.

358
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,696
And if you're watching this,

359
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,164
then I guess they got to me.

360
00:52:48,196 --> 00:52:49,598
If it's not you, not to worry,

361
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,300
I'm long gone by now.

362
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,702
Now pay attention.

363
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:55,405
This video will erase
itself after just one play.

364
00:52:56,738 --> 00:52:58,474
Now your memory is
either returning,

365
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,544
or by a chance, you
found your way home.

366
00:53:00,776 --> 00:53:02,144
You and several others
have been held in

367
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,247
a military compound for
the last four weeks.

368
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,249
And this morning, we
managed to get you out.

369
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,252
During your time in
captivity, you've been fed

370
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:11,521
a drug which is
extremely powerful.

371
00:53:11,553 --> 00:53:13,322
You've been sedated,
and the drug causes

372
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,758
memory loss.

373
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,160
Now you'll be feeling the
withdrawal symptoms of this.

374
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,095
Which are confusion,
headaches and fragmented

375
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,098
memory retrieval.

376
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:25,035
The effects can last
up to 30 minutes.

377
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:29,638
We have managed to obtain
a few samples of these,

378
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,707
the pill they have
been giving you.

379
00:53:32,408 --> 00:53:34,277
Analysis has shown it to contain

380
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,179
biochemical agents.

381
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,680
Which we know are
linked to the military.

382
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:11,748
Thanks.

383
00:54:33,468 --> 00:54:35,237
Jane, you're okay.

384
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,707
Alex, what
are you doing here?

385
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,776
I need to talk
to you, right now.

386
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,711
You can't be serious.

387
00:54:41,743 --> 00:54:42,778
You think you can
just come waltzing in

388
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,681
after disappearing for a month?

389
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,883
How dare you!

390
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:48,551
Do you know what that did to me?

391
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:52,354
Two minutes.

392
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:54,823
Can you cover for me?

393
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:55,791
Yeah.

394
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,466
Let's hear it.

395
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:04,334
We need to get out of here

396
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,502
as soon as possible.

397
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,304
What?

398
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,638
I'm in some sort of trouble.

399
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:10,874
People are after me,
it's not safe here.

400
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:11,774
What are you talking about?

401
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:13,176
Where have you been?

402
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,312
I can show you.

403
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:23,752
Damn it!

404
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:25,688
It was all on here.

405
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,289
What was?

406
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,459
Okay, this is
gonna sound crazy.

407
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,728
But I think I'm
part of some sort of

408
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,496
military, pharmaceutical
experiment or something.

409
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,732
Are you kidding me?

410
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:36,665
No.

411
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:37,566
You think you can just show up

412
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,668
with some bullshit excuse

413
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,502
and I'm just gonna let
you walk back in my life?

414
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:41,703
It's true.

415
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:43,706
I don't care if it's
true, you left me!

416
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:46,642
Jane, they're
going to kill me.

417
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:49,211
Well why did you come here?

418
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,314
Because I need your help.

419
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,151
And I wanted to see you.

420
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:57,486
Okay.

421
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,722
Go to my room, 406,

422
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:01,524
I'll meet you in five minutes.

423
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,643
Yes, put me through
to Dr. Parsons

424
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:22,279
at once please.

425
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,781
There's been talk of a
disturbance at the lab,

426
00:56:25,814 --> 00:56:27,650
what exactly is going on there?

427
00:56:28,584 --> 00:56:29,386
What?

428
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:31,221
We have a situation.

429
00:56:31,854 --> 00:56:33,522
We're not sure.

430
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:36,492
Well we'll probably pick
him up on the street

431
00:56:36,524 --> 00:56:38,327
somewhere, dazed and confused.

432
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,696
Well, that is unless
he's collapsed already.

433
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:44,201
That is unlikely.

434
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,745
Prevara.

435
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:06,722
There are some people
that are asking questions

436
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:07,857
on the street.

437
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,995
Jane, we don't have much time.

438
00:57:13,595 --> 00:57:14,563
Wait here.

439
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:26,809
Can I help you please?

440
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:37,319
Where is he?

441
00:57:42,658 --> 00:57:43,627
I love you.

442
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:45,495
And I remember.

443
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:49,979
They'll be here any second.

444
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,098
Come on, come on, up,

445
01:01:09,131 --> 01:01:10,133
let's go!

446
01:01:15,803 --> 01:01:17,773
Come on, and you, come on!

447
01:01:18,173 --> 01:01:19,876
Move, go!

448
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:21,544
This way, go!

449
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:25,047
And you, move!

450
01:01:27,883 --> 01:01:29,752
Come on, now, go!

451
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:39,028
Go, move!

452
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:43,665
Go, go, go!

453
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,809
Go, go, the door's over there!

454
01:02:08,856 --> 01:02:10,225
Come on, just go!

455
01:02:29,944 --> 01:02:31,747
Come on, this way.

456
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:03,746
Come on!

457
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,036
Come on!

458
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,805
Here, plan B, put these on.

459
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:37,366
We need to get out of
here, get lost in the town,

460
01:05:37,399 --> 01:05:38,768
it's our only chance.

461
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:41,203
Where do I go?

462
01:05:41,803 --> 01:05:44,539
You keep running, in
about another 10 minutes,

463
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,408
your memory's
gonna return, okay?

464
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:48,010
Then you find your way home.

465
01:05:50,979 --> 01:05:51,981
You take these,

466
01:05:52,013 --> 01:05:53,448
it's the pills, the evidence,

467
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,350
just in case I don't make it.

468
01:05:57,952 --> 01:05:58,953
What do they do?

469
01:05:58,986 --> 01:06:00,255
They affect your perception,

470
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,457
it's some form of
biochemical agent.

471
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,294
It taps into your hyper
conscious awareness.

472
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,064
Is that why I don't
remember anything?

473
01:06:09,097 --> 01:06:10,832
No that's the side effect,

474
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:12,534
or possibly a safety measure.

475
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,805
It confuses you, it stops
you guys from escaping.

476
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:19,908
So whatever these
are, they're pretty

477
01:06:19,941 --> 01:06:21,309
damn powerful.

478
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:23,912
Dangerous in the wrong hands.

479
01:06:24,946 --> 01:06:27,048
We think it's an
experimental weapon,

480
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:29,085
being developed by
the British military.

481
01:06:30,017 --> 01:06:31,586
Hence all the security measures.

482
01:06:41,396 --> 01:06:42,430
Get out.

483
01:06:43,598 --> 01:06:44,566
Move it!

484
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:47,502
Out!

485
01:06:51,138 --> 01:06:52,307
Get out!

486
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:56,945
My orders are to
recover you unharmed.

487
01:06:57,511 --> 01:06:59,080
To continue our work.

488
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,952
Unless you have become aware
of the nature of that work.

489
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:06,588
In which case, I'm
gonna kill you.

490
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,574
Enough running.

491
01:08:32,606 --> 01:08:34,443
I'm tired of being chased around

492
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:36,979
like some sick animal in a lab.

493
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,580
So if you want me...

494
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:42,050
Here I am.

495
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:45,721
Just remember, sometimes,

496
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:48,156
a sick animal bites back.

497
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,716
The sick animal always dies.

498
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,779
It's me Brink.

499
01:10:18,245 --> 01:10:19,515
How the hell did you do that?

500
01:10:19,547 --> 01:10:21,349
You knew every move
before he made it.

501
01:10:21,783 --> 01:10:24,352
That pill I took, it's like

502
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,655
I can see the future,
or versions of it.

503
01:10:28,256 --> 01:10:29,458
But that's not possible.

504
01:10:30,691 --> 01:10:32,194
When we were fighting,

505
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:35,131
all the events played
out in my mind,

506
01:10:35,763 --> 01:10:37,800
like an echo of the future.

507
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:40,668
It was so real, I could
almost get lost in it.

508
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:42,771
Almost.

509
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:45,141
What a weapon.

510
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:47,542
Now I understand what
the memory blockers do.

511
01:10:47,809 --> 01:10:49,544
If you can't remember
where you are,

512
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,180
then you won't find
a path out of there,

513
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:52,146
while they're testing you.

514
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,082
There they are!

515
01:10:53,114 --> 01:10:53,648
Come on, they're coming,

516
01:10:53,681 --> 01:10:54,782
let's go, let's go.

517
01:10:54,815 --> 01:10:55,583
Stop!

518
01:11:26,914 --> 01:11:28,450
I'm gonna kill him.

519
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:30,151
Let's go

520
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:38,727
Come on Alex, let's go, quick!

521
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:41,330
My head.

522
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:42,830
Now come on, try and remember.

523
01:11:42,864 --> 01:11:44,165
Remember?

524
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,701
The pill, the evidence.

525
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:49,305
Look, here, take my watch.

526
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:52,440
Try to remember in 30 minutes,

527
01:11:52,473 --> 01:11:53,641
everything will be clearer,

528
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:56,645
now run straight, I'm gonna
create a diversion, now go!

529
01:12:43,624 --> 01:12:44,726
Back here again.

530
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:46,928
Everything that's
happened since,

531
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,696
has played out in your mind.

532
01:12:49,763 --> 01:12:51,800
The boats, the buildings,

533
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:52,835
the gym.

534
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:55,171
It's all simulation.

535
01:12:57,739 --> 01:13:00,576
The drug, that's how it works.

536
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:03,811
See you in the real world.

537
01:13:40,748 --> 01:13:42,016
Don't move.

538
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,485
Or I'll blow your head off.

539
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:47,822
Goodbye my friend.

540
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:50,492
Remember.

541
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:50,926
Remember, remember...

542
01:13:53,528 --> 01:13:55,530
Remember, remember...

543
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,415
Hey, asshole!

544
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,717
I need your help.

545
01:14:48,749 --> 01:14:50,686
-Please.
-What?

546
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,387
Meet me here.

547
01:14:52,419 --> 01:14:53,821
What the hell are you doing?

548
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:54,923
In 13 minutes.

549
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:56,925
-Why?
-I'll fix your roof.

550
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:30,459
Jane, I'm so glad I found you.

551
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,660
Alex, what
are you doing here?

552
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:33,962
I really
need your help.

553
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:37,766
Come on.

554
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:39,868
Can you cover me?

555
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:40,935
Yeah.

556
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:44,740
Here.

557
01:15:44,772 --> 01:15:47,476
Go to my room, 406, I'll
meet you up in a bit.

558
01:15:48,476 --> 01:15:49,111
Wait.

559
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:08,730
There are some people asking
questions in the street.

560
01:16:08,762 --> 01:16:09,631
Tell me where he is!

561
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:10,898
You know where he is

562
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,803
Jane, we don't have much time.

563
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:18,906
Wait here.

564
01:16:40,561 --> 01:16:41,863
Can I help you please?

565
01:16:43,064 --> 01:16:44,633
This is a residential area.

566
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,781
There's no one here,
whoever you're looking for,

567
01:17:00,815 --> 01:17:02,951
there's no one here, just...

568
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:04,618
Get out!

569
01:17:04,651 --> 01:17:05,787
Where is he?

570
01:17:39,954 --> 01:17:41,857
My roof, are you crazy?

571
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,695
Alex, Alex are you okay?

572
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,636
Go, they're going to kill us.

573
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,851
This road looks so familiar.

574
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,086
I feel like I've
been here before.

575
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:46,688
When?

576
01:18:46,721 --> 01:18:48,790
I don't remember, a
long time ago perhaps.

577
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:01,029
No!

578
01:20:15,943 --> 01:20:17,244
Someone...

579
01:20:18,178 --> 01:20:19,247
Someone!

580
01:20:19,913 --> 01:20:20,848
Help!

581
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,718
Help!

582
01:20:38,432 --> 01:20:39,767
The drug!

583
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:40,901
That's how it works.

584
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:41,870
Fragmented.

585
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:42,704
Simulation.

586
01:20:42,736 --> 01:20:43,370
Memory.

587
01:20:43,404 --> 01:20:44,039
Remember!

588
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:44,939
Retrieval.

589
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:04,693
I feel like
I've been here before.

590
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:05,761
When?

591
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,796
Remember.

592
01:21:42,329 --> 01:21:43,731
I love you.

593
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:45,033
Yeah, same same.

594
01:21:45,065 --> 01:21:46,834
Stop saying that!

595
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:47,802
Why, it's true.

596
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:49,704
It doesn't sound real.

597
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:51,271
It's real.

598
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:52,207
How do you know for sure?

599
01:21:52,973 --> 01:21:54,175
Because I feel it.

600
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:56,912
Then say it, say
it to me properly.

601
01:21:58,913 --> 01:21:59,981
Okay.

602
01:22:00,914 --> 01:22:01,882
I love you.

603
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:07,021
And I'll always love you.

604
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:10,225
Until the end of time...
