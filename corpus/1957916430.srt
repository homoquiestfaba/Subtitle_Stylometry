1
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,656
<i>That night started
simple enough.</i>

2
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,701
<i>It was a launch party for the video
game "Werewolves Awaken Online."</i>

3
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,787
<i>And I was the lead programmer.</i>

4
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,791
<i>The infamous tech mogul Brian Fenris
brought me in right out of school</i>

5
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>and proclaimed me
his star protégé.</i>

6
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,631
<i>The event was the start of a big
marketing push to create some buzz.</i>

7
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:51,634
<i>Brian wanted me to be the poster
boy, the face of his company.</i>

8
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:56,139
<i>All the media bigwigs, corporate
honchos and celebrities were there.</i>

9
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>I hated crowds,
and I really hated parties.</i>

10
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,648
<i>But I did my job,
and I showed up.</i>

11
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,444
<i>I thought I had everything
under control.</i>

12
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,529
<i>We were in a very different
game that night.</i>

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,157
<i>We were the game.</i>

14
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>We were the prey
waiting to be slaughtered.</i>

15
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,662
Hey, Padre!

16
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,498
I got a confession for you.

17
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,629
You're dead, August.

18
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,299
August? I said you're dead.

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,759
See?

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,386
I told you,

21
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,387
I'm not the werewolf.

22
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,894
<i>Totally unaware of what's
really going on.</i>

23
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:27,981
<i>I'm anxious because I'm about to
face the media any minute now.</i>

24
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,941
<i>Let's get introduced
to the players of the game.</i>

25
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:34,321
If August isn't the
werewolf, that means...

26
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,406
<i>That's Veronica
in the red dress.</i>

27
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,907
<i>She's Brian's lawyer.</i>

28
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,661
<i>Veronica is a God-fearing
conservative</i>

29
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:43,246
<i>who has brought her
Bible-thumping husband Luke</i>

30
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,582
<i>and sister Betty to the party.</i>

31
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,417
<i>There's this awkwardness in the way
they communicate with one another,</i>

32
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,879
<i>but I just stayed out of it.</i>

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,422
Brian? Brian's the werewolf?

34
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,259
No, I'm not.

35
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,929
The narrator runs the game,
he's never the werewolf.

36
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,349
<i>This is my boss, the creator of the
game and founder of Supermoon Media.</i>

37
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,017
<i>Brian Fenris.</i>

38
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,812
<i>He's as intelligent
as he is eccentric.</i>

39
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,022
<i>The lady that he's with
is Nikki.</i>

40
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,612
<i>She's Brian's assistant
and current fling at the moment.</i>

41
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:18,322
I thought you'd know the rules to the game
that your wife has been working on, Luke.

42
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,782
Oh, really, Nikki?

43
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,453
So you know who
the werewolf is, then?

44
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:26,039
It's easy.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,958
It's me.

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,922
And me.

47
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,426
And you thought I was the wolf.

48
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:41,012
Well, darling, anybody could
be hiding as the werewolf.

49
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,806
My husband,

50
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,976
or even my sister.

51
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:48,896
Besides, you seemed like
you had something to hide.

52
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:52,024
Yeah, I was hiding the fact

53
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,901
that I knew who the werewolves
were the whole time.

54
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,321
You knew it was Betty and Nikki?

55
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,656
Oh, no.

56
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,658
No, I thought it was you, too.

57
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,996
Everything ready?

58
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,414
You're on, team.

59
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:10,501
<i>Here we have Remy,
our publicist.</i>

60
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:14,421
<i>His job is to ensure that Brian's
shenanigans stay out of the headlines.</i>

61
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,589
<i>He's banking
on my squeaky clean image</i>

62
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,092
<i>to deflect the focus around
the allegations against Brian.</i>

63
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,093
Excellent.

64
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,682
So, you get the gist of how
to play the game, Natasia?

65
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,771
Well, on the night turns, the
werewolves choose a player to kill,

66
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:33,439
and on the day turns, everyone,
including the werewolves,

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,567
votes to execute someone
trying to kill the werewolf.

68
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,736
<i>Natasia the blogger.</i>

69
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:42,074
<i>Brian hired her to do his tell-all
story from his perspective, of course.</i>

70
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:45,702
<i>It's another strategy
to shift Brian's bad boy image.</i>

71
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:48,707
<i>But that wasn't the only reason
he hired Natasia.</i>

72
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,001
Paranoid, murderous fun.

73
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,796
Of course, it's usually played
with a larger group than this,

74
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,547
that's why it'll be
such a hit online.

75
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,967
I just can't believe that
August didn't show you the

76
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,721
original playing cards
for your feature.

77
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,556
No, he didn't.

78
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,684
Well, you stick with me, and
I'll get you some great footage.

79
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,062
And a private interview.

80
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,482
All right, let's lead
with the stars of the spot.

81
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,402
Nikki and August...

82
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,696
Where are you, man?

83
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,656
Let's go, August.

84
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,407
- I'll see you later?
- You better.

85
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,784
All right.

86
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:28,411
Remy, really, is this necessary?

87
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,539
Up front, you're the man
of the hour.

88
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,752
Go, August.

89
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,544
- Awesome gameplay, August.
- Thanks.

90
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,004
- Awesome.
- Thanks.

91
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,881
I love you, August.

92
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,632
Dude, that's great.

93
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,217
August, I love the beta.

94
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,802
Cool.

95
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:31,057
Smile harder, August. Social
engineering takes more than one person.

96
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,601
I prefer software
engineering, Remy.

97
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:37,981
Yeah, I get that, but I've been branding you
up against Brian's dominant personality.

98
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:40,651
Is this... honestly,
is this really necessary?

99
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,902
Okay, can you get August
out on stage?

100
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,655
- Yeah, of course.
- Show me your teeth.

101
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,657
All right, folks...

102
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,869
He's not kidding about
Brian's personality.

103
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,871
And I can speak from experience.

104
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,873
God knows, sometimes
I just wanna...

105
00:06:58,627 --> 00:06:59,877
- Hi, Stan.
- Stan?

106
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,797
- How'd you know it was me?
- Stan?!

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,217
<i>This is my buddy Stan.</i>

108
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>Wet met back in college while he
was working on his fourth degree.</i>

109
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:13,682
<i>He's the smartest guy you'll ever
meet who believes Big Foot exists.</i>

110
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,852
<i>Although he's much older,</i>

111
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,646
<i>I'm definitely
the responsible one.</i>

112
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,689
<i>But he cracks me up.</i>

113
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,151
<i>And he's the only person
I really trust.</i>

114
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:24,237
Now I have to go clean this up.

115
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,074
She's a wild one.

116
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,826
But seriously,
how did you know it was me?

117
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,912
Your glee is radiant,
Stanley, radiant.

118
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,789
Yeah, so is your misery,
cupcake.

119
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,582
Hey, you wanna see
something cool?

120
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,294
Where are you reaching to?

121
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,089
Original first edition
werewolf playing cards.

122
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,841
- Do you know how rare these are?
- No.

123
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,884
- Dude, they're rare.
- Okay.

124
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,846
Look, you may not know this, but this...
this is a party for our game.

125
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,682
It's not our game,
we just worked on it, remember?

126
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,809
Sure, Brian's game then.

127
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,646
Well, we're not entirely sure
it's Brian's game either.

128
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,731
Look, I just pick the
winners, all right, August?

129
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,567
I don't make excuses
for the losers.

130
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,819
Well, it's Brian's excuses
in front of a jury

131
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,654
that has Veronica
so worried right now.

132
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,322
So you think he stole it too?

133
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,242
I don't know.
I don't really want to know.

134
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:14,577
I'm just a bit
overwhelmed right now.

135
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,996
A month ago I'm at work, and
none of us even know each other.

136
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,082
Yeah, good times, buddy.

137
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,042
Then suddenly Brian shows up
with buckets of money

138
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,212
and brings a bunch
of strangers online together

139
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,756
through his social engineering.

140
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:28,591
So, what's wrong with that?

141
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,217
- You know what I don't get?
- What?

142
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,011
How he introduced himself.

143
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,721
Sends me a Facebook gift.

144
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,097
- He sent you a gift?
- Yeah.

145
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,891
All he did was poke me.

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,809
You know what poking means.

147
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,938
I can't sit down,
I can't walk straight.

148
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,232
But seriously, who does this?

149
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,192
After four weeks we're just
gonna launch the game with this?

150
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,904
It's a little much,
don't you think?

151
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,072
Yeah, and on time, too.
Last night of the hunter's moon.

152
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,700
Brian's not gonna miss a
marketing opportunity like that.

153
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,252
God damn it, Stan!

154
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,798
Yann?

155
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,968
What the hell
are you doing here?

156
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,346
Winning you back.

157
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,057
<i>I'm not sure how Yannick
even got into this party.</i>

158
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,852
<i>But everyone at work
had heard about this guy.</i>

159
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:24,147
<i>Brian would lose it on Nikki
whenever Yannick was brought up.</i>

160
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:27,024
<i>He's Nikki's ex,
and Brian's a jealous man.</i>

161
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,111
I'm not some goddamn trophy
for you to win, Yannick.

162
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:33,322
If Brian sees you,
he'll kill you.

163
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,659
Remy, too. Hell,
I should kill you myself.

164
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,243
Uh... Nikki!

165
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,172
Give me one reason why I
shouldn't set security on you

166
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,132
and have your ass
dragged back to France.

167
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,676
And make it a good one.

168
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,262
I want you back, Nikki.

169
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,764
I'm with Brian now.

170
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,141
Really?

171
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:01,102
Does Brian know this?

172
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,187
We have an understanding.

173
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,857
Well, understand
that I love you.

174
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,359
And I know that you
still love me, too.

175
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,696
Not the way you
speak to me sometimes.

176
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:15,073
I've gotten help, Nikki.
Real help.

177
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,286
You threatened me, Yannick.

178
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,622
But I never did
any of those things.

179
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,167
Can we just talk?

180
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,088
Take off that stupid suit.

181
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,177
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

182
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,444
With the caliber of stunts
Brian can pull off,

183
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:56,364
this... this is kind
of... shame.

184
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:00,117
Agile development, virtual
companies, viral launch parties,

185
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,202
that's how business
is done today.

186
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,372
Welcome to the future.

187
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,249
Yeah, but who are
all these people?

188
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,210
I don't know,
look at this douche bag.

189
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,254
You got the viral video invite:

190
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,342
"An intimate gathering with some
of my most intimate friends."

191
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,804
He always has that
angry look on his face.

192
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,222
Leave it to Brian to mix
viral and intimate.

193
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,936
A surefire recipe for genital
crabs meets genital warts

194
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,354
on a dark and rainy night
of chlamydia.

195
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,272
Enough,
you're taking it too far.

196
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,899
- What, you never had crabs before?
- You always take it too far.

197
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,776
- Listen...
- No, I didn't have crabs.

198
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,152
The way he's dragging
you around tonight,

199
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,113
I wouldn't be surprised
if you get

200
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:39,031
some intimate friends
of your own tonight.

201
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,867
Boom-chaka-boom-chaka
boom-chaka...

202
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,371
Shut up! You're so loud.

203
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,956
Hey, despite your
miserable attitude,

204
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,317
I think we got a chance with
those two hot skanks over there.

205
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,796
I love a girl with a hat.

206
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,341
- Shh! Shh! She's here.
- Wait, you know those muffins?

207
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,136
- Dude, introduce me.
- No, shut up. Not them.

208
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:01,138
- Is my breath okay?
- Not them. Her.

209
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,482
Don't look, don't look.
You can't be looking.

210
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,567
Why can't... You point,
what am I supposed to do?

211
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,986
- Stop looking.
- It's hard not to.

212
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,987
You're pointing at her and you're
telling me to look over there.

213
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,824
Plus, she's hot.
How do you know her?

214
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,242
She's that girl that
follows me online.

215
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,494
She's your internet stalker?

216
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,121
Shh!

217
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,956
How'd she get in here?

218
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,832
I invited her.

219
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,001
You invited your internet
stalker to the party?

220
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,002
Well, she's not a stalker.
We've been talking online.

221
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,587
Dude, that takes balls, man.

222
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,966
She's really hot for a stalker.

223
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,843
She's not a stalker.

224
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,860
Yann?

225
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,988
Yann, is that you?

226
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:06,036
Oh, it's you.

227
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,203
You scared the shit...

228
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:24,053
You're gonna
have to do that again.

229
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,330
That's a pretty awesome looking
shirt you got going on there.

230
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,187
You gotta be kidding me.

231
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,064
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,066
This job brings out
the worst in you, darling.

233
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,651
And what, pray tell,
is the worst in me?

234
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,320
Intemperance.

235
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,572
"But put on
the Lord Jesus Christ

236
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,032
and make no provisions
for the flesh

237
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,659
to grant its desires."

238
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,952
Romans 13:14.

239
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,541
Oh, we're gonna talk about
resisting desires?

240
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,334
Let's ask Betty to join
in our little discussion

241
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,002
about sins of the flesh.

242
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,921
Shall we?

243
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,591
"And let he who is without sin
cast the first stone."

244
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,218
John 8:7.

245
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,971
Are we quoting scripture?

246
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:11,017
Because I don't think that our Lord and Savior
would approve of your workplace, Sister.

247
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:15,104
"Be sober-minded, be watchful.

248
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,274
You adversary, the Devil, prowls
around like a roaring lion,

249
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:21,277
seeking someone to devour."

250
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,405
Peter 5:8.

251
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,283
Yeah, it's time for
another one, please.

252
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,327
Ladies and Gentlemen...

253
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,121
Okay, shush. Brian's on.

254
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,081
Introducing...
the prankster supreme,

255
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,626
the technology guru,

256
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:41,964
The CEO of Supermoon Media
and all-around lycanthrophile,

257
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,633
Mr. Brian Fenris.

258
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,971
Thanks, Remy.

259
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,974
Remy Lisel, everyone,

260
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:53,309
the man who put "social"
in "social engineering."

261
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,978
Let's hear it for Remy.

262
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,487
I think a lot of you know
August, my lead developer

263
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,991
and my code-monkey prodigy,

264
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:11,994
who, without him,
this game would not be possible.

265
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,997
Let's hear it for August.

266
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,332
For those of you
who don't know me,

267
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,295
I am Brian Fenris.

268
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,261
Well, today
is full circle for me.

269
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:32,431
Or full moon, if you will.

270
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:36,769
I started Supermoon Media
by printing

271
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,522
"Werewolves Awaken" card games
in my garage.

272
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,151
But today, thanks to August,

273
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,154
and others,

274
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:50,658
I can announce the launch of
"Werewolves Awaken Online."

275
00:15:55,163 --> 00:16:00,417
360 interactive on your
browsers, your mobiles.

276
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,712
Each week you can be

277
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:06,174
one of the villagers
trying to survive,

278
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,426
or you could be the werewolf,

279
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,137
secretly hunting and preying,

280
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,639
and eliminating the other
players one by one.

281
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,642
Ahh!

282
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,312
Stan Bachman, everyone.

283
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,232
Maybe the only man who knows
more about werewolves than I do.

284
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,570
Now, I'm sure we all have
questions for Mr. Fenris.

285
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,741
Would you care to discuss
the ongoing litigation

286
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,411
over the lack of credit to the original
"Werewolves Awaken" co-creator?

287
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,706
We're not here to talk
about that tonight.

288
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:40,582
Melanie, how can you
get any work done

289
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,584
when you're always
flirting with me?

290
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,129
You know, if you lose your job,

291
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,589
I can't support you,
now that you've migrated from

292
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,177
my bedroom to the newsroom.

293
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,765
Hi!

294
00:17:01,147 --> 00:17:03,856
So...

295
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,276
So...

296
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:09,111
- So that's how it's gonna be?
- How what's gonna be?

297
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,614
I'm finally here...
in person.

298
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,826
There's no computer screen.

299
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,414
And that is how you're
gonna say hello to me?

300
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:22,207
Well, I guess you showed how
little all that time meant to you.

301
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,292
What?

302
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,630
Oh, hi.

303
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,176
Hi, I'm Stan.

304
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,802
I'm friends with August.

305
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,638
Hello, Stan.

306
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,809
So, Cheyenne, what do you do?

307
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,897
Turns out she's a cam girl,
I just found out.

308
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,817
- A what?
- She...

309
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:50,320
I take my clothes off
on the internet for money.

310
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:56,159
Lots of money.
And I'm not ashamed of it.

311
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,577
- Why were you hiding it from me?
- I wasn't hiding anything from you.

312
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,581
So you just forgot to mention what
you do for months and months on end?

313
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,707
Wait a minute!

314
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,501
Are you Sololady23?

315
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,586
I am.

316
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,296
Toehugger1337.

317
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,589
What?

318
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,882
- Yeah!
- No way.

319
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,717
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

320
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,844
You gotta be kidding me.

321
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,596
That's okay.

322
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,556
And do you know why it's okay?

323
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,724
Because I look amazing naked.

324
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,767
Dude, she looks
so awesome naked.

325
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,479
Yeah, see? It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

326
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,689
I don't think it's bad, I just...

327
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,609
I just... this is just
all really weird right now.

328
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,695
Abomination!

329
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,741
You've brought
an abomination on us all!

330
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,661
This land was ours
before you arrived.

331
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:41,454
Our honored dead
claimed the land in blood.

332
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,872
It's they you insult,

333
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,584
desecrate with this abomination.

334
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,794
Not again.
How'd he get in here?

335
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,297
I don't know.
Uh, Father...

336
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,257
Don't you "Father" me, young pup.
You helped bring this upon us all.

337
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:58,471
But, Father, surely my generous
weekly donations to the church...

338
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:02,224
Cannot buy back your soul for
being part of this den of sinners.

339
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,811
This sin, or any other,

340
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,774
the Lord shall flay
thy wolfish visage.

341
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,652
You have truly marked
yourself for the Beast.

342
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,534
Well, the game keeps
coming alive all night long.

343
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,412
The priest character
is part of the

344
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,372
exclusive expansion pack

345
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:29,417
that will be a gift to all
my special guests tonight.

346
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,754
Get Argus working on patch
to add that skin

347
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,341
as soon as possible.

348
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,634
All right,
how about some drinks?

349
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,469
How about some champagne?

350
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,514
Weak stunt.

351
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,683
That dude is terrible
casting for a priest.

352
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:49,480
Okay, I'm gonna check
on this PR guy.

353
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,862
Stan, can you show her around?

354
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,751
Yeah, Toehugger,
that makes sense.

355
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:11,294
Well, you know,
if you got big toes.

356
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:14,296
If you got big toes...

357
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,341
- So this is where August works?
- And me.

358
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:19,342
Brian has us both sequestered
here under his watchful eye.

359
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,887
- So, Brian's pretty controlling, you know?
- I've heard.

360
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,764
And what I'm about to
show you, only he,

361
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,807
August, and I have ever seen.

362
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,809
Whatever you do,
you can't tell Brian,

363
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,519
because if he finds out,
he'll kill me.

364
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,855
Okay.

365
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,697
the panic room!

366
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,785
So, you're saying
these are all real?

367
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,497
Real silver, every one.

368
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,962
Just like the silver bullet
around my neck.

369
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,677
Now, if a real werewolf
ever attacked me,

370
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,847
he better watch out.

371
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,934
As you can see tonight,
I'm all about

372
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,979
genuinely immersive games.

373
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,522
There's nothing I love more
than being inside

374
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,693
a visceral experience.

375
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,362
Really?

376
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,907
Really.

377
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:31,541
Hey.

378
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:34,001
Hey, August.

379
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,044
I thought I'd check in
after that whole mess.

380
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,962
Everything okay?

381
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,716
Yeah, Father's just always
like that, fire and brimstone.

382
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,052
Father, as in, the priest.

383
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,054
Right. That dude
was pretty intense, man.

384
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,726
Yeah, no worries. You're
coming to the post-party game?

385
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,894
Uh, actually I was gonna...

386
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,731
That was a statement,
not a question. You're coming.

387
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:56,399
Bring your date.

388
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,067
My date?

389
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,696
Yeah, the hot babe
that Stan's dragging around.

390
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:03,489
No, no, no, she's not my date.

391
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,742
Like Stan could ever
get a girl like that.

392
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:10,663
Anyways, it's good geek chic sex
appeal for Natasia's feature.

393
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:27,137
Hey, you're August, right?

394
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,891
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you created the game.

395
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,851
Well, Brian did, so.

396
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,977
Oh, the old guy, yeah,
he looks like my dad.

397
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,606
He said you created it.

398
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,691
No, well, I did
the interactive game.

399
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,442
He did the original game, so.

400
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,152
Oh, so he's the money guy.

401
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,781
You know, I have a lot of
really great ideas for games.

402
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,699
We could do one.

403
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,744
That's more of a Brian thing.

404
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,996
But you could
introduce me, right?

405
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:54,957
I... I guess I could, I mean.

406
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,669
You know, it's a lot
of hard work, coding.

407
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,797
A game engine's
based on a framework

408
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,757
that encompasses
a library of modules

409
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:06,552
that configure
and manage gooeys...

410
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:09,221
Gooey? What's a gooey?

411
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,682
Uh, it's not important.
It's fine.

412
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,809
You're funny.

413
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,812
You know, I have a lot
of really great ideas for games.

414
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,731
You should introduce me
to your boss.

415
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,484
Uh...

416
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,486
Tell you what.

417
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:27,697
I want you to see my gooey.

418
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:31,201
Um... I... I gotta go.

419
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:36,164
I-I should... I should really go.

420
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,916
Yeah.

421
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,711
What?

422
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,046
Well, I'm just kind
of with somebody,

423
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,802
you know, so we have a thing...

424
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,899
Okay...

425
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,277
Cheyenne,

426
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,529
you're the... you're the best.

427
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,866
You're the best.
You're the most beautiful,

428
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:14,871
smart, incredible,
amazing girl I've ever met,

429
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:17,790
and... Ugh! That's horrible.
That's shit. Come on.

430
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,312
Hello?

431
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,691
I-I wanted us to be honest
with each other. You know?

432
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,942
Like, do your parents even know?

433
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,737
Are they concerned?

434
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,989
That's horrible.

435
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,785
Hey, what's going on back there?

436
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,122
Okay...

437
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:05,087
I know you, okay?
And if we're together,

438
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,341
you don't have to feel like you
need to do this type of stuff.

439
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:11,092
Stupid.
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

440
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,845
Okay.

441
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,808
I'm sorry.

442
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,020
Cheyenne, I'm sorry.

443
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,820
Are you taking a number 2?

444
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,663

- Save it. I know how you work.

I did not appreciate

but you can't control me.

Brian, may I introduce
Richard, my trainer.

Melanie and I were just
discussing an exclusive.

we all love so much.

470
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,872
I can guarantee you
one-on-one time

Have a safe drive.
Take care, man.

478
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,316
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

479
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:31,275
Appreciate the love, man.

480
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,110
Take care.
Thank you.

If the have-nots ever want
to tear down Brian's empire,

482
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,784
he can hole up here for months.

483
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,412
He's got bed, food,
a urine filtration system

484
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,747
that turns your piss
into drinkable water,

485
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,916
kind of like a flat champagne.

486
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,917
- Really?
- Not that I tried it or anything,

487
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,921
but yeah.

488
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,257
- Does he have any guns?
- No, Brian's not into guns.

489
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,051
Too random for him.

490
00:27:57,052 --> 00:28:00,762

and do a few more rounds
for the news piece,

511
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,839
so I was thinking maybe
you should head in soon.

512
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,382
For sure.

513
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,596
So, maybe you can... head in?

514
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:25,847
Oh, yeah. Oh, of course.

- Yeah.

Um, listen,

00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,152
I'm... I'm sorry about before.

519
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:42,197
I'm just not so sure
about people anymore.

520
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,574
Yes, you mentioned that.

521
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:48,496
And I don't think
what you do is bad.

522
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:51,206
Well, I didn't think
that you would.

523
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:54,209
I mean, you dated a stripper.

524
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,213
Um... a stripper?

525
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:03,009
Remember when you told me
that you dated a stripper?

526
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,889
Oh, yeah. That.

527
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,057
- I made that up.
- You made it up?

528
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,061
- Yeah.
- I mean...

529
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,522
you make this big stink
about how I make a living,

530
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,526
and then just go
making up stuff?

531
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,902
I was trying to impress you.

532
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,656
- Oh.
- Let's just... Can we just drop it?

533
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:26,574
Okay.

534
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,579
The sooner we can get out of
here, then we can just talk.

535
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,081
Really... really talk.

536
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,417
But just for the record,
I was completely aware

537
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,086
that you were lying
about the stripper thing.

538
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,254
It was very ridiculous.

539
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,882
- Mm.
- Okay.

540
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,468
Cool.

541
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,944
Shouldn't we see what those
screams were about?

542
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,487
Nah, that's just how Brian
runs his games.

543
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,491
Bastard always has to take it
to the next level.

544
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:09,577
He just doesn't know
how to relax.

545
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,205
Are you nearly done?

546
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,292
Just one more thing.

547
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,127
What are you doing?

548
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,463
Causing some real damage.

549
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,596
Now for the fuel line.

550
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,137
Hey!

551
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,267
Ah.

552
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,154
Melanie's question,
Father Roman's outburst...

553
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,281
I don't feel confident.
Do you feel confident?

554
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,993
Is Nikki back?

555
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,668
God!

556
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,601
That's Nikki?

557
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,395
- Oh, my God. No.
- Sweet Jesus.

558
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,618
Go on! Go!

559
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,544
All right, everyone,
let's get inside right now.

560
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:45,382
Hey, buddy... Who are you, man?

561
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,013
Let's go.
In the house, now.

562
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:04,233
Okay, just calm down.

563
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,112
Brian? What the hell, man?

564
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,282
I know this piece of shit!
I'd know Yannick anywhere!

565
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:15,744
- Yannick?
- Shut up, you goddamn murderer!

566
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,371
- I didn't do it!
- You abusive piece of shit!

567
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,582
I loved her!

568
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,836
Like hell!
You fucking killed her!

569
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,755
Everyone is inside
asking questions.

570
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,469
- It's him.
- Is that Yannick?

571
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,764
What does it look like?

572
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:38,641
Stop, we don't even know
what happened here.

573
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,770
Let's get him up
and call the cops.

574
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:48,276
And no one touch anything
until the cops get here.

575
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,697
Stan, get him up.

576
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,246
Come on, you don't
need to be here.

577
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:00,790
Come on.

578
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,779
- Hey, what's going on?
- What is going on?

579
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,491
Who is this?
Did he do that to Nikki?

580
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,742
That's Yannick, Nikki's ex.

581
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,662
He said he found her
a few seconds before we did.

582
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:43,874
Okay, look, everyone,

583
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,251
obviously something
terrible has happened.

584
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,337
WE don't know exactly
what it is, but...

585
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:52,507
We're calling the cops and we're
gonna wait here until they come.

586
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,717
They're not coming.

587
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,886
I can't reach them,
the line's dead.

588
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,807
What?

589
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:11,859
Okay, I'm going out
to the junket box.

590
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,362
August, I want you
to keep everybody here.

591
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,531
Nobody leaves!

592
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,742
Remy, come with.

593
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,287
Wait. Wait, where's Melanie?

594
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,541
Melanie and her guy?

595
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:29,586
They were walking out the
front door before the screams.

596
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,713
Where did they go?

597
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:15,882
Two murders, Melanie in shock.

598
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,842
The phone's out,
and we're down to one car.

599
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:21,012
So we're gonna play this smart.

600
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,847
I'm gonna hold the fort,
you're gonna go for help.

601
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,307
What are you gonna do
about Yannick?

602
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,602
Now don't worry, he's not the killer.
I know that.

603
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,771
He was with us the whole time.

604
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:32,357
But I wanna see him sweat a bit.

605
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,694
So, I've got the emergency
flares from the panic room.

606
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,779
I want you to take
Stan and your girl

607
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,781
and get out of here.

608
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:42,784
I can't believe this shit.

609
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,369
We're gonna go to the top
of the hill,

610
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,622
we're gonna try and reach a
signal with the cell phones,

611
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:50,374
we're gonna call the cops,
you guys just stay inside.

612
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,503
Okay? This shit's fucked!

613
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,637
Guys, I'm really worried about
everyone back at the house

614
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,724
because this is the video game
coming to life.

615
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:09,394
I don't know who it is, but it's got
to be someone connected to the game.

616
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,687
So, I'm pretty sure
it's a werewolf.

617
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,441
Stan.

618
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,067
I'm sorry, but come on.
Full moon, we're cut off.

619
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,611
And did you see those bodies?
They were shredded.

620
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:21,573
Is anyone getting a signal?

621
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,327
- Eyes on the road!
- What the hell is that?

622
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,871
She has a gun!

623
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,956
Yeah, I have a gun.

624
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,584
I own guns, I like to shoot guns.
It relaxes me.

625
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,627
Does it have silver bullets?

626
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,506
Can you hear yourself?

627
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:40,592
Who have I been talking to
this whole time?

628
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,062
Look out!

629
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,552
Oh, God.

630
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,514
Okay, just calm down,
everybody. Calm down.

631
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:29,807
But the lights are out!

632
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:33,437
I can see that the lights
are out, Veronica.

633
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,857
Where's your
generator, Brian?

634
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,735
In the shed.

635
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,447
Now just relax, all right?

636
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,951
You can't mean to have us go out
there with a killer on the loose.

637
00:38:47,952 --> 00:38:49,703
Or leave us in here with one.

638
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,373
Relax!

639
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,709
Remy, keep everyone here. I'm gonna
go out to start the generator.

640
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,627
And you're coming with me.

641
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:00,421
- What...
- Come on, Yannick.

642
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,923
Come on!

643
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,758
Cheyenne? Cheyenne!

644
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,679
Cheyenne? Hey!

645
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,224
Are you okay?

646
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,812
Yeah? Come here.

647
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,027
Holy... Oh-oh-oh!

648
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:06,863
What's...

649
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,453
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my God.

650
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,707
I don't know what that was,

651
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,959
but we're not far
from the house,

652
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,544
so let's get going.

653
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:24,797
It just ripped
her whole spine out, man.

654
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,509
- Shut up, Stan.
- That is not a human thing to do.

655
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,719
- Stan, shut up.
- There's no way we're dealing with a regular human here.

656
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,096
Will you listen to yourself?

657
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,931
Is this guy an ordinary killer?

658
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,892
He's not an ordinary guy.
He's a psycho killer.

659
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,729
But, August, what about that thing
you crashed your car trying to avoid?

660
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,064
- Large, furry...
- Deer. Goat.

661
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,567
Werewolf.

662
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,777
Calm down.

663
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,196
- Calm down. You're okay.
- I'm okay?

664
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,906
- You're okay.
- Are you sure?

665
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:53,076
- Yeah.
- Guys.

666
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:55,244
This is Yannick's shirt.

667
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,748
We gotta get back now.

668
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:40,999
Shut it down now!

669
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,752
August!

670
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,255
Remy!

671
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,802
- Damn. You really know how to use that gun.
- Yes, I do.

672
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:55,346
She's got a gun?

673
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:58,307
She's got 12.

674
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:01,227
So, did you guys
bring back help?

675
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,729
We didn't get far
before the crash.

676
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,982
Melanie, she's dead.

677
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,277
- From the crash?
- From the werewolf.

678
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,612
There is no werewolf.

679
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,697
Wait, what?

680
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,076
Melanie's dead,
but not from the accident.

681
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:17,578
She was murdered.

682
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,749
What the hell happened in here?

683
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,127
I mean, we were attacked.

684
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:28,713
- By the werewolf?
- Veronica: By the devil!

685
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,844
Brian took Yannick with him to
go and start up the generator

686
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,723
while the rest of us waited.

687
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,726
Our flare was dying.

688
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,896
Remy was about to start
another one when...

689
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:47,272
that's when it struck.

690
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,317
We could hear it come in.

691
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,818
It knocked out Remy.

692
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:55,281
<i>My brave Luke tried but failed,</i>

693
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,325
and it made its way
to my sister.

694
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,163
And I always look after
my little sister.

695
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,252
I have seen sin.

696
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,005
So much.

697
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,050
And my sin...

698
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,345
my sin has been suppressing it.

699
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,807
Keeping it all quiet.

700
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,102
Brian's thievery.

701
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:28,939
My sister
and my husband's infidelity.

702
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,028
And no one is blinder
then she who will not see.

703
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:41,245
And so God saw fit to take my eyes from
me so that I might see more clearly.

704
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,755
But he did grant me
one more mercy.

705
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,217
The light that
chased away the evil

706
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:58,637
also showed me its face.

707
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:02,389
Father Roman spoke the truth.

708
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,225
We are cursed
for what we've done.

709
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:10,732
God showed me the truth.

710
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:19,031
Remy, what did you see?

711
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,242
I don't know.
I was out of it.

712
00:44:21,243 --> 00:44:23,244
I don't know what I saw.

713
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:25,454
Luke?

714
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:29,751
- It was a demon.
- Luke, seriously?

715
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:33,379
If Veronica says it was a demon,
it was a demon.

716
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,756
Don't any of you guys get it?

717
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,342
There's a monster here,
all right, but it's only a man.

718
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:41,221
- Yannick.
- No, it's not Yannick.

719
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,432
Think about it.
Who's still missing?

720
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,769
You don't...

721
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:49,812
- Brian?
- He's finally lost it.

722
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:52,022
- It's gotta be Brian.
- But Brian...

723
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,191
I mean, it does make sense.

724
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,236
You all know he's crazy.

725
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:59,362
But not that kind of crazy.

726
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,951
- No, this is absurd.
- Remy, think through it.

727
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:06,121
Who's been killed so far?
Brian's ex-girlfriends...

728
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:07,831
Melanie and Nikki.

729
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:09,416
And both the guys
they had on the side.

730
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:11,292
- Yeah, but how?
- Simple.

731
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,128
He starts off with Nikki.

732
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:17,006
Sets up the body.

733
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:19,132
<i>Then he comes in
like he hasn't seen her.</i>

734
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,136
Is Nikki back?

735
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:24,179
Leaving Yannick to find the body
and cause all the suspicion.

736
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,267
Then when he goes to check the phone
lines, he takes care of Richard.

737
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,229
And we were away
for like an hour.

738
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,316
He had plenty of time to leave
with Yannick, take care of him,

739
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:38,069
finish off Melanie,
then try for you guys.

740
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,571
- But what about what Veronica saw?
- The devil.

741
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,116
Yeah, Stan,
where's your costume?

742
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:45,826
- Costume?
- That stupid werewolf costume you were scaring everyone with.

743
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,162
- The utility shed.
- The utility shed,

744
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,956
where Brian went with Yannick.

745
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:53,835
- It's so obvious.
- I don't know, August.

746
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:58,172
- Why would he do this?
- Because he's a short-tempered,

747
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:01,177
werewolf-obsessed,
control-freak psychopath, Remy.

748
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,846
Come on, Remy.
It makes sense.

749
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:07,347
But not with
what we know about him.

750
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,518
We've known him
for like a month, tops.

751
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:14,147
Maybe...
maybe Brian is a werewolf.

752
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,363
Brian's an insane killer
and we've got one gun.

753
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:25,032
We've got these.

754
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:28,244
It's not a goddamn werewolf.
Silver's not gonna help.

755
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,871
Dude, werewolf or not,

756
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:35,042
you stick the pointy end of
one of these into somebody,

757
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,211
you win.

758
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,213
Grab everything.

759
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,528
Stay.

760
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,091
Turn around, Brian.

761
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:48,717
It's over.

762
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,513
Step aside, or I swear...

763
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,687
Shut up and lose
the stupid costume, psycho!

764
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,735
- Where's Remy?
- He saw something in the woods and ran off.

765
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:56,453
Guys, uh, guys.

766
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,248
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

767
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:15,804
I want you to know
that Luke and I were so...

768
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,432
so sorry.

769
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:21,561
- I got 'em!
- Beatrice.

770
00:50:21,562 --> 00:50:24,773
- Yes?
- The curse approaches.

771
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,318
You son of a bitch.

772
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,282
You maniac.
I got him!

773
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:37,285
Damn it, August.
I knew it had to be him.

774
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,748
It's Yannick.

775
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:53,134
Remy, damn it.
What are you doing?

776
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,802
He can't possibly be the killer.
There's no way.

777
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:58,139
- Why the hell not, August?
- He has no motive.

778
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,224
Motive?!

779
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:03,186
This monster has been abusing
Nikki for the past three years.

780
00:51:03,187 --> 00:51:04,311
Christ!

781
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:07,231
You'r genious Brian
theory was hanging by a thread

782
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:09,232
and you dragged us out
in the goddamn darkness for it.

783
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:12,527
- What? Where's Brian?
- He's dead.

784
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,572
Cheyenne and I found him dead.

785
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:20,369
- But that doesn't mean Yannick...
- Yes, actually, I think it does mean Yannick.

786
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,664
- Bring me that chair.
- No, no. Remy, listen.

787
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:26,667
Listen to me. We found these
cards on all the bodies.

788
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:28,837
What does that tell you?

789
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:36,342
- That Yannick is a crazy psycho.
- No.

790
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,679
It has to be someone who knows
the game as well as you.

791
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,516
Or you. Or you, Stan.

792
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:45,519
- Stan, you're hearing me, right?
- I don't know, August.

793
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,356
I mean, we found him naked
in the woods covered in blood.

794
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,484
Classic werewolf M.O.

795
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:53,527
Bela Lugosi, 1941.

796
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,404
December 12th to be exact.

797
00:51:55,405 --> 00:51:58,949
Even a man who's pure of heart
who says his prayers at night...

798
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,867
Remy...

799
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,787
what are you doing?

800
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,247
What we should've done
a long time ago

801
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,667
when we found
this little monster.

802
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:11,713
Remy, you don't plan on
killing him in cold blood?

803
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:15,717
No, I don't.

804
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:22,723
But Veronica will.

805
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,235
I am the instrument of God.

806
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,904
He is my eyes.

807
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:39,949
And I am His hand.

808
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,701
Jesus, Remy.
What the hell, man?

809
00:52:41,702 --> 00:52:43,244
This is sick!

810
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:45,579
By Your will, oh, Lord,

811
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,249
I shall cleanse us
of this curse.

812
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,334
Guide my hand

813
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,382
and restore us unto Your grace.

814
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:07,268
Nobody goddamn well moves,
you hear me?

815
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:11,606
- Cheyenne...
- No, August.

816
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:14,275
- Cheyenne.
- I said no, August!

817
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,986
Hey, I don't know you.

818
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:19,404
Not really.

819
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,783
You know me like I know you.

820
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:26,245
I do know you.

821
00:53:26,705 --> 00:53:30,957
I know your dad's
favorite advice to give is,

822
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,378
"You die now,
or you die later."

823
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,344
And if we stick together,

824
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:44,638
no one else is
gonna die, Cheyenne.

825
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,648
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

826
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,949
It's gonna be okay.

827
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,659
It's gonna be fine.

828
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,953
Murderer!

829
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:15,462
- Betty!
- Stan: No!

830
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:29,683
Oh no. Oh no.

831
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,608
Betty... Betty.

832
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:43,029
No.

833
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,574
Please.
No one else is gonna use it.

834
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:48,035
Just lay it down on the ground.

835
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,728
Mm. Imported.

836
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:38,461
Smart man.

837
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:40,796
Smart but...

838
00:55:40,797 --> 00:55:42,631
not smart enough.

839
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,841
You monkeys never are.

840
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,928
I mean, you build all this...

841
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,767
the cottages, electricity,
the Internets.

842
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,728
You light up the darkness.

843
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:01,107
And now we talk about
the social media.

844
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:03,486
Bringing the world together.

845
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:05,529
How many friends do you have?

846
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,492
Who's following who?

847
00:56:10,202 --> 00:56:13,537
But all you've really done
is digitize

848
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:16,123
the most basic function of
any successful species...

849
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,960
the tribe.

850
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,092
But you forgot
the most basic function.

851
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:31,722
To keep the wolves out.

852
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:35,892
Why?
Why are you doing this?

853
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,687
The only reason...

854
00:56:38,688 --> 00:56:41,064
the hunt.

855
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,149
I mean, sure,
the hunger drives it,

856
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,905
but really the hunt is
its own delicious reason.

857
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:51,784
The chase.

858
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:53,869
The herding.
The playing.

859
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,997
That's why.

860
00:56:56,915 --> 00:57:00,834
- How long you been planning this, you sick bastard?
- Plan? No, no, no, August, no.

861
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:04,087
There's no fun in planning.

862
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:07,508
But why here?
Why now?

863
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,011
I know what you want.

864
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:13,764
A reason.
An explanation.

865
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:15,891
But...

866
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:17,851
I have already given you
the only reason

867
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:19,937
that has ever mattered
between species.

868
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,525
Predator...

869
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:28,028
and prey.

870
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,116
The rest is just natural course.

871
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,286
So what now?
You gonna kill us?

872
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:38,038
Have you been listening at all?!

873
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:52,720
The hunt is on.

874
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:56,014
And for the sport of it,

875
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,727
I am going to give you
a head start.

876
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,855
So...

877
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:06,525
run!

878
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:11,907
Whoa.

879
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:25,042
Betty! Betty!

880
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,004
Come on, come on.

881
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,840
Come on.

882
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:41,309
Hurry! Come on!

883
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,061
Come on!

884
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,231
I love you.

885
00:58:45,232 --> 00:58:48,693
Come on, you son of a bitch.

886
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,825
No!

887
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:14,134
No. Oh, no. No.

888
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:16,802
No. No, no.

889
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,931
Okay.

890
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:20,767
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

891
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,062
It's a werewolf.

892
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,276
- So what do we do?
- Stan: What?

893
00:59:30,277 --> 00:59:32,986
What do we do now?
How do we stop it?

894
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:36,697
- How the hell should I know?
- You're the goddamn werewolf expert.

895
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,951
- It's...
- You always know everything!

896
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:42,287
- You always know everything!
- How the hell should I know what to do?

897
00:59:42,288 --> 00:59:44,164
Huh?! Tell me!
What are we supposed to do?

898
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:45,416
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- Hey! Hey!

899
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:46,917
August, stop it!
Stop it!

900
01:00:04,102 --> 01:00:06,811
I just really need
your help right now

901
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,940
because I don't think I'm as
prepared as you are to accept this.

902
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:15,194
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, bro.
- Sorry.

903
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,407
Seriously, I think
we're safe in here.

904
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:24,247
- Oh, he's in the shed.
- Maybe we can use something to shore it up.

905
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,376
The shelves.

906
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:32,337
Oh, yes, excellent, because a few
assemble-it-at-home tables and shelves

907
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:35,458
are gonna be able to stop a monster that
can smash through a fucking steel door.

908
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,055
Well, it'll slow 'em down
so we can get to the...

909
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,133
Feel better?

910
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:15,857
I know I do.

911
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,735
Oh, you don't know
how good this feels.

912
01:02:20,572 --> 01:02:22,990
The hunger...

913
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:27,370
My hunger is gone.

914
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,164
First time in 200 years.

915
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,917
The hunger is gone.

916
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:44,262
My turn is over.

917
01:02:47,265 --> 01:02:49,225
But the hunt is eternal.

918
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,852
Father taught us that.

919
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:55,229
Forever and ever,

920
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,775
a hunt without end.

921
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:04,990
The predator's predator.

922
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:15,543
Father is still hungry.

923
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,884
Stan: August,
what was he talking about?

924
01:03:23,885 --> 01:03:25,887
It doesn't matter.

925
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:32,184
- No, we're missing something.
- He was messing with us.

926
01:03:32,185 --> 01:03:33,894
He loved this whole twisted
rampage the whole way through.

927
01:03:33,895 --> 01:03:36,896
No, there's something more
to what he said.

928
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,150
We're missing...

929
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,070
You...

930
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,200
Oh, it's you.

931
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:54,290
Me.

932
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,932
Oh, Remy.

933
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:17,563
He so liked playing
with his food.

934
01:04:22,277 --> 01:04:25,028
And I love all my children.

935
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:29,533
No matter
how childish they may be.

936
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,288
You were so young.

937
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:42,462
What was the point of
killing my best friend?

938
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:43,964
Killing all those
innocent people?

939
01:04:43,965 --> 01:04:45,465
For what?
For some high?

940
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:52,137
I'm afraid I'm too old
and too wise

941
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:56,142
to play the games
of my young pups.

942
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:59,063
Oh, well, in that case...

943
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,650
Come on.
Go, go, go!

944
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:04,378
Here we go again.

945
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,595
How long did Stan say that
that door is gonna last?

946
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,725
Not long enough.

947
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,662
Do we have any silver left?

948
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,380
Lost it all.

949
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,595
Except...

950
01:06:58,265 --> 01:06:59,767
What are you doing?

951
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,232
Brian's silver bullet.

952
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,443
He always wore it.

953
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:14,782
Where's your gun?

954
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,785
It's by the car outside.

955
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,622
Here's the plan...

956
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:24,792
I'm gonna use that back door...

957
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,126
gonna grab the gun,

958
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:29,462
you're gonna load this bullet,

959
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,214
you're gonna shoot him
in the heart.

960
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:35,218
August...
August, this is crazy.

961
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:39,306
How do you even know
that this is gonna work?

962
01:07:39,307 --> 01:07:41,350
You can do this.

963
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:47,648
You die now, or you die later.

964
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:14,217
Hey, Padre!
I got a confession for you!

965
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:57,694
August...
August, come on.

966
01:09:57,695 --> 01:09:59,613
August...

967
01:10:24,347 --> 01:10:30,477
I love all of my children.

968
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,820
Cheyenne...

969
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,783
Cheyenne.

970
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:50,330
Cheyenne.

971
01:10:56,087 --> 01:10:58,463
You did it.

972
01:11:04,512 --> 01:11:06,680
You did it.

973
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,851
Die now...

974
01:11:11,852 --> 01:11:13,728
or die later.

975
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,942
No.

976
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,696
No, not now.
Not now, Cheyenne.

977
01:11:23,697 --> 01:11:26,033
Not now.
Not now, Cheyenne.

978
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,412
Stay with me.

979
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:13,162
<i>My wounds had completely
healed by the morning</i>

980
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:15,789
<i>and fur started to grow.</i>

981
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,460
<i>I hadn't learned
how to control it yet.</i>

982
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:24,131
<i>Roman's bite had passed on
the disease.</i>

983
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:27,844
<i>That night consumes me.
It's my obsession.</i>

984
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:30,680
<i>I have it in me.</i>

985
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,977
<i>Now, I'm the monster.</i>
