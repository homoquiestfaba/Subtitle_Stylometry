106
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,685
Took me over an hour

all those broken ornaments

108
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,720

- Hey.

(chuckles)

110
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,097
You know, yelling too loud can cause
phonotrauma and vocal fatigue.

111
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:06,695
Sorry about that, buddy.
I thought you were downstairs.

112
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,728
Hey, don't forget
about lunch, okay?

113
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,399
I won't.

114
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,432
Now, I know on Mondays
you prefer ham,

115
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,775
but I made you
a turkey melt on rye.

116
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,577
Ooh, with homemade
dill mayonnaise, I hope.

117
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,412
- Is there any other kind?
- Mmm-mm.

118
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,419
You'd better take a shower
when you're done.

119
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,853
- What for?
- So you don't smell like old socks.

120
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,220
-( laughs )
- I can't take care of you forever, Dad.

121
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,247
One of these days
it would actually be nice

122
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,524
if you would, you know,
date a girl.

123
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,395

I will when you will, okay?

124
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,593
Okay. Gross.

125
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,861
Phonotrauma?

126
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,340
Is that even real?

127
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,366

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,846
Winter break, finally.

129
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,052
This is gonna be an even better
Christmas than last year.

130
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,589
No.

131
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,861
One-- you're never supposed
to be in the house,

132
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,927
and two-- you're never, ever ever
supposed to be in the house all wet.

133
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,202
Dad's gonna ground both of us
until we're as old as Dad.

134
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,767
And in dog years that's like, 300.

135
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,801
You need to dry off first.

136
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,007
(whines)

137
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,214
Oh, no.

138
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,333
Bobby, please tell me
you're leaving for the bus.

139
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,363
Right away, Dad.

140
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,591
( Spitting )

141
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,634
Oh, Chilly.

142
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,001
Oh--!

143
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:32,410
We should have named him
Destructo-Dog.

144
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,176
Argh.

145
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,475
Bobby's voice:
First, don't panic.

146
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,116
Chilly is keeping his name.

147
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,853
Qkay.

148
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,328
This is when my Christmas story
begins to get interesting.

149
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,126
But before we get to that,

150
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,463
you should probably meet
my best friend Caps.

151
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,490
I know, weird name, right?

152
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,526
You'll see.

153
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,561
Hey, Carl.

154
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,904
Hey, Caps, nice hat.

155
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,543
Do you mean nice for real,
like, "Wow, cool hat,"

156
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:12,044
or sarcastic nice, like,
"Wow, you're embarrassing me."

157
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,026
No, really.
I think it's really...

158
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,755
Lame?

159
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,820
If there was a Super Bowl
for stupid hats,

160
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,355
you would be
a world champion.

161
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,390
'Morning, Kizzy.

162
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,767
Tell him, Bobby,
that thing on Caps' head

163
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,703
is a bully magnet
for the Mahoney brothers.

164
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,198
Don't worry, Kizzy.
I can take care of us.

165
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,539
I'm pretty heroic.

166
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,773
Oh, you mean your dad's
pretty heroic.

167
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,882
If anyone's gonna take care of us,
it's gonna be me.

168
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,818
How many black belts in karate
do you two have?

169
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,186
Hmm-mm-mm.

170
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,350
Either way,
I've got a game today

171
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,417
and you're throwing off
my mojo.

172
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,191
She's scary.

173
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,993
You know,
I heard she bites too,

174
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,057
like a dog.

175
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,431
She does not.

176
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,231
Yeah?
Well, ask Timmy Johnson.

177
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,398
He borrowed her pencil
and forgot to return it

178
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,272
and she lashed onto his leg
like a hungry pit bull.

179
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,576
She called me Bobby.

180
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,176
That's your name, genius.

181
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,118
I know. I just didn't know
she knew it.

182
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,953
Oh my gosh, you like her?

183
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,390
No.

184
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,020
Uh-huh.
Advice-- she's a biter.

185
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,759
If I were you, I'd start carrying around
lots of Band-Aids.

Good morning, buddy.

Hey, I'm not sharing
Bobby's sandwich with you,

191
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,816
if that's what this is about.

192
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,954
What is going on around here?

193
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,833
'Morning, Lieutenant.

194
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,766
Mind telling me
what's going on around here?

195
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,599
- You didn't hear?
- Hear what?

196
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,538
Obviously we all remember
Detective Cole

197
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,008
catching a suspect
on the FBI'-s most wanted list.

198
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,942
Oh, come on, they don't want
to hear that story again.

199
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,640
Ah, but there's more.

200
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,377
I have something for you.

201
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,851
It's from the FBI.

202
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,952
"Dear Detective Cole,
once again,

203
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,050
the Federal Bureau of Investigation
is grateful for your acts--"

204
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,788
yadda, yadda, yadda--

205
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,228
"offering you the position
of Special Agent

206
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,631
leading the Robbery Task Force
in New York City field office."

207
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,794
( cheering )

208
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,771
"To take over a major investigation,
we need you immediately,

209
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,398
no later than December 28th

210
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.
I didn't say I was taking the job.

211
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,237
Are you crazy?
This is the FBI.

212
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,613
If you don't take this job,
I will fire you

213
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,879
- and then you will have to take it.
- Ha, that's funny.

214
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,909
Look, it's not just me.
I've got a son-- Bobby.

215
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,252
- I mean, you know, Chilly--
- The dog?

216
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,155
He poops, he eats,
he sleeps all day.

217
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,888
Come on, you don't need
to worry about him.

218
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,419
(Chilly whining)

219
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,650
(fast music playing )

220
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,956
Do you feel lonely?

221
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,986
Do your friends and family
sometimes leave you behind?

222
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,126
The new PX-35 diet and workout
make the perfect Christmas gift.

223
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,363
Eat and exercise your way

224
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,339
to better and positive energy.

225
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,637
And everybody
will want you around.

226
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,869
Remember, a high-protein meal
is important.

227
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,616
Don't be afraid to use
an exercise ball.

228
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,936
And keep your body clean.

229
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,274
And after your PX-35 workout,

230
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,339
you'll have the time to do the things
that make you feel great.

231
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,122
(trickling )

232
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,216
And isn't feeling great
what life is really all about?

233
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,926
Look, I was born
in Sunshine Beach.

234
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,456
I mean, that house has been
in my family for three generations.

235
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,230
Look, they're paying
for your whole move.

236
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,431
They even rented you an apartment
in Midtown.

237
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,531
All the memories of Bobby's mom
are here.

238
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,372
I mean,
it's just such a big move

239
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,934
in such a short amount
of time.

240
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,968
Look, change is good.

241
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,948
You need it.
You've outgrown this place.

242
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,315
And the only job left for you to take
is mine, and I'm not going anywhere.

243
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,254
It's definitely a big salary bump.

244
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,158
I could take advantage and put
a college fund together for Bobby, but--

245
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,183
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.

246
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,787
Maybe?
You know I'm right.

247
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,661
I'm always right.
That's why I'm the boss.

248
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,724
But he's lucky.
He's got a good dad,

249
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,134
got someone to look up to.

250
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,628
I just hope I'm making
the right decision.

251
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,165
Lieutenant: You know what my dad
used to always say?

252
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:36,043
"Bravery is not the absence of fear.
It is the action in the face of fear."

253
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,413
You must be Lieutenant Stone.
I'm Detective Jasper Harris.

254
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,611
I just transferred from
the Santa Barbara Police Department.

255
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,450
Detective Cole, meet your
new replacement Detective Harris.

256
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,082
Replacement? What made you think
I was gonna take the job?

257
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,251
Oh, please. I said if you didn't,
I was gonna fire you.

258
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,262
I know your record well, Detective.
I'm stoked about taking over.

259
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,592
That's great.

260
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,895
Here's your last case.

261
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,662
Dognappers?

262
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,673
Are you serious? This is the case you
want me to go out on-- a poodle pincher?

263
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,800
Somebody's been stealing
rare breeds of dogs

264
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,707
worth thousands of dollars
from kennels.

265
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,643
It's a good case for Junior here
to get his feet wet.

266
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,443
Jasper, ma'am. It's Jasper.

267
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,278
Why don't you go pull the car around
for you and Detective Cole?

268
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,618
You got it.

269
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,681
I'm gonna miss this place.

270
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,989
I might even miss you
a little bit, Stone.

271
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,358
It's the right decision
for you and for Bobby.

272
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,696
Now go on, go get me
one last bad guy.

273
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,095
Hey, I'm stoked.

274
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,941
Man: The thing you need to know
about me, Mr. Gribbling,

275
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,611
is that I deliver results,
period, guaranteed.

276
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,847
As a matter of fact,
I believe my colleagues

277
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,015
have secured some new
merchandise as we speak.

278
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,047
Excuse me. Well?

279
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,391
We had to break a window to get in.
I cut myself. It's not like the movies.

280
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,455
Not to worry, Mr. Quarterman.
We got the package.

281
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,933
(whines)

282
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,958
Merchandise in hand.

283
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,267
We'll have the rest of the items
on your list within a week

284
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,102
and we'll make the flight
on Christmas Day.

285
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,666
Michael Quarterman
always gets his dog.

286
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,974
Idiot.

287
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,815
( Horn honking )

288
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,913
( barks)

289
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,075
Winter break-

290
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,513
no school and no homework.

291
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,539
And no teachers.

292
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,312
Nothing's gonna stop this
from being the best Christmas ever.

293
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,494
( Rumbling )

294
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,626
(engine stops)

295
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,660
All right.

296
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,606
Looks like we got
a blowout, kids.

297
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,075
So everybody, sit still.

298
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,476
Oh, great-

299
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,917
only one block away
from freedom.

300
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,579
What else could go wrong?

301
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,723
Oh, no.

302
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,559
Shane and Jake-
the Mahoney brothers.

303
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,707
Don't they own any shirts
with sleeves?

304
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,252
Caps, the hat--

305
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,152
take off the hat.

306
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,453
I thought you liked the hat.

307
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,955
Bobby, not the hat.

308
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,454
Hey, somebody hit my brother
with a hat.

309
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,228
No, they didn't.

310
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,497
- Oh, I thought you said "with a cat."
- No.

311
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,097
Was it one of you?

312
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,573
Uh...

313
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,884
-( liquid trickling)
-( Chilly barks)

314
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,890
You even touch these geeks,
you half-brain bullies

315
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,631
are gonna get kicked
in the roasted chestnuts.

316
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,469
Dude, your girlfriend here
is tougher than you are.

317
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,475
Yeah, jeez, Cole, aren't you
supposed to be the one

318
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,135
with the big hero cop dad?

319
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,169
Yeah, come on, save the day.
Who are we gonna punch?

320
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,978
Um, may we propose
an option

321
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,314
- where no one gets punched?
- Yeah.

322
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,512
No.

323
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,350
I think I'll start
with you, Cole.

324
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,685
(Chilly barking. growling)

325
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,194
You know, I don't speak
dog language,

326
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,790
but I'm pretty sure
that's Chilly'-s way of saying

327
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,494
to back off his friend

328
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,629
or he's gonna bite you
on the roasted chestnuts.

329
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,401
Hey, this ain't
no pet store, man.

330
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,845
No dogs on the bus.

331
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,815
I'm sorry.
We'll all walk from here.

332
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,010
Come on.

333
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,861
♪ Sun, comin' down... ♪

334
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,873
Man, I've never seen
the Mahoney brothers

335
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,069
come close to peeing
their pants before.

336
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,411
I gotta admit, Bobby, I didn't think
you'd have a dog this cool.

337
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,074
Don't call Chilly a dog.

338
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,143
Then he's a freakishly
large hamster.

339
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,586
To Bobby,
Chilly'-s not just a dog.

340
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,556
Chilly'-s his best friend.

341
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,252
And you had my back, pal...

342
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,588
as always.

343
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,724
Maybe once I could be
the one saving you.

344
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,031
Yeah, right.

345
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,610
- Clumsy enough?
- Sorry.

00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,241
Whatever.

349
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,221
I just didn't want to get blood
on my new basketball jersey.

350
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,917
Are you seriously
gonna eat that?

351
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,089
Mm-hmm.

352
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,326
Aww, really?

353
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,632
We'd better clean up
before your dad comes home.

354
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,332
It's Friday.
His shift doesn't end till 6:00,

355
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,637
which gives us plenty of time.

356
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,668
Cole:
I'm home, buddy.

357
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,841
Quick, clean up.

358
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,875
(all overlapping )
Come on, hurry, get the pizza.

359
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,581
What are we gonna do?
Come on, Bobby, we gotta hurry up.

360
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,283
Hurry up, hurry up.
Wait, Bobby, stop.

361
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,054
Come on, there's so much.

362
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,820
Hurry, come on, guys.

363
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,527
Come on, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry.

364
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,127
Bobby's dad's coming.
Hurry.

365
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,832
No, no, Chilly, get off the table.

366
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,636
No, Chilly.

367
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,267
Chilly, Chilly.

368
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,869
Chilly, come on.
He's coming.

369
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,846
Chilly. Come on, Chilly.
Hurry, you guys.

370
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,009
Oh, no.
Chilly, come on, stop eating.

371
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,680
Not the ice cream, Chilly.
Not the ice cream, no.

372
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,896
Vanilla bean.

373
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,160
It's pretty good.

374
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,734
Come on, Tiger, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

375
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,762
(seagulls cawing )

376
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:24,305
Bobby: So when you were my age,
were you, like, you know, heroic?

377
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,338
Cole: When I was your age,
I was much smaller,

378
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,373
much skinnier...

379
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,683
and I was afraid of everything.

380
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,711
Bobby:
Really?

381
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,524
Cole:
But then my dad told me

382
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,290
that even a hero is just as afraid
as cowards.

383
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,627
Bobby:
What's the difference?

384
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:45,226
Cole:
Well, a hero steps forward

385
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,601
and a coward steps back.

386
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,006
So, speaking of
stepping forward,

387
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,605
I have something important
I need to discuss with you.

388
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,641
Okay, I didn't know Chilly peed
in your shoes until it was too late.

389
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:05,416
Okay-- two important things
to discuss with you.

390
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,050
But first, I was offered a job

391
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,286
to run the Bank Task Force
for the FBI today.

392
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,317
- I accepted it.
- Cool.

393
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,193
Okay, now we're federal agents.

394
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,290
I mean, technically you are,

395
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,234
but me and Chilly are too,
since we're all part of the family.

396
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,531
We are, right?

397
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,561
Of course we are.

398
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,596
It's just that...

399
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,802
this field office
isn't in Sunshine Beach, son.

400
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,834
It's in New York--

401
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,245
Manhattan, to be exact.

402
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,046
So we're moving?
When?

403
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,519
The day after Christmas.

404
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,544
What about Chilly?

405
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,650
Well, we're probably
gonna be living

406
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,059
in a small apartment, son,

407
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,085
in a high-rise

408
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,327
with no yard
and no place to run.

409
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,663
Dad...

410
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,500
Look,

411
00:24:54,526 --> 00:25:00,306
Chilly is a huge Sapsali, okay?
He's not a baby Chihuahua.

412
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,835
He's meant to be outside,
running.

413
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,008
- That's what makes him happy.
- He'd be happy in an apartment.

414
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,075
He's in our house for 60 seconds
and he destroys half the place.

415
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:12,247
There's just-- there's just no way
we can take him.

416
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:15,121
I promise you we'll find
a great home for him,

417
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:19,561
somebody to adopt him
that will love him.

418
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,428
There's just no way
he can come with us.

419
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,600
(computer chirping )

420
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,417
Hey. Got your text.

421
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,690
Sorry about the move.
Does Chilly know?

422
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,596
Yeah, he knows.

423
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,829
Let's face it-- your dad's right
Chilly'-s no indoor dog.

424
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,097
Yeah, but Chilly would like
New York.

425
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,401
And I bet he'd totally
love the snow.

426
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,068
Actually, it snowed
in Sunshine Beach,

427
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,134
but only once in history.

428
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,704
Caps, me and Chilly are not in the mood
for one of your geek-o-rama jokes.

429
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,080
Seriously, in 1950.

430
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,382
The mayor's three-year-old son Sammy
lost his dog.

431
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,413
On Christmas morning, it snowed for
the first time ever in Sunshine Beach.

432
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,756
Sammy was able to follow
the footprints in the snow

433
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,227
and it led him
right to his lost dog.

434
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,561
They called it the "Sunshine Beach
Christmas Miracle."

435
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:06,057
That's what Chilly needs-
a Christmas miracle.

436
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,332
Your dad knows
how much Chilly means to you.

437
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,569
He's not gonna move until he's sure
you have found a home for him.

438
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,511
Yeah, Dad did say we'd find Chilly
a loving owner.

439
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,447
That's it.

440
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,882
That's it. That's it.

441
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,389
Who's it? What's it?
How's it?

442
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,585
If we cannot find somebody
to adopt Chilly,

443
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,992
we can't go.
He promised.

444
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,089
So all we have to do is make sure
that nobody adopts Chilly.

445
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,566
Interesting plan, has potential.

446
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,126
The question is, will it work?

447
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,704
It has to work.

448
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,040
Bobby's voice:
So that was the plan.

449
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,807
If Operation Christmas Miracle
was to be a success,

450
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,815
I'd have to make sure
nobody adopted Chilly.

451
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,785
It was time to begin
phase one--

452
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,418
what we kids like to call
"sucking up to your parents."

453
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,258
Wow, something
smells awesome-

454
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:10,892
omelet, delicious
cinnamon rolls, bacon.

455
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,993
Everything's better
with bacon, right?

456
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,594
What's the occasion?

457
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,300
Occasion?
Who needs an occasion?

458
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,707
Like I need a reason to make
the best dad a guy could ask for

459
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,871
a breakfast he deserves?

460
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,041
( Chuckles )
Okay, I suppose not.

461
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,948
Even when
I was spending hours

462
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:31,044
hand-making cinnamon roll batter
from scratch,

463
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,556
all I could think about
was how amazing it is

464
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,048
to have a heroic dad
who is the most heroic police officer

465
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,221
in the history
of law enforcement.

466
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,321
You know, it's illegal
to bribe a police officer.

467
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,127
I'm not trying to bribe you.

468
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,498
- Is it really?
- It is.

469
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,198
Now, son, listen to me.
Chilly'-s gonna get a great home.

470
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,572
I mean, I've already looked
at a pet adoption website online. Look.

471
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,506
We've got some potential new owners
coming by this afternoon.

472
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,571
Unfortunately,
I have to get going.

473
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,981
I got a call about another
kennel break-in.

474
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:04,111
Do me a favor, brush Chilly
so he looks nice and clean

475
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,588
for the prospective owners
that are coming by later, okay?

476
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:10,081
I want him to look good.
And thank you for this breakfast.

477
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,595
- I'll call you later.
- Have a good day, Dad.

478
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,129
Bobby, come here, please.

479
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,226
So I've reprogrammed
the motion detectors

480
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,170
and the door and window alarms.
So if anything funny happens,

481
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,230
I'm gonna get an alert
right to my phone.

482
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,741
( Beeping )

483
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,641
Oh, and on top of that,
Mrs. Hepacott

484
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,542
is gonna keep an eye on you
from next door.

485
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,810
Dad, I don't need a babysitter,
especially her.

486
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,942
She's really old
and she smells like cheddar cheese.

487
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:38,011
Ugh, she does kind of smell
like cheddar cheese, doesn't she?

488
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,578
I know, right?

489
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,232
Jasper: The break-in
was on Ocean Drive and 5th.

490
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,398
- We're two minutes out.
- Cole: Copy that.

491
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,101
- Can I turn on the siren?
- I don't think so.

492
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,706
Do you have a list of the dogs
that were stolen, Mr. Schmidt?

493
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,271
Yes, sir, Detective.

494
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,715
I knew you would be needing one.
Got one right here.

495
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,582
( Police radio chatter)

496
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,554
Oh, yeah. I recognize
some of these rare breeds

497
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,648
from the other two
crime scenes in the file.

498
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,125
- Valuable?
- Yes, sir. They fetch top dollar,

499
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,890
thousands even.
Even more if they're sold overseas.

500
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,922
This wouldn't happen to be your glove,
would it, Mr. Schmidt?

501
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,628
No, no, no,
way too fancy for me.

502
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,467
I use canvas-
works better on dog slobber,

503
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,734
urine, fecal matter-

504
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,039
- you know, doggy potty.
- Yes, sir, we got that.

505
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,442
How do we know
it wasn't your glove?

506
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,002
I don't think we need
to hear that.

507
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,879
You hesitated, Mr. Schmidt. I can tell
from the veins on your forehead

508
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,248
that your heart rate's
just increased by 22%.

509
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,844
Perhaps you're plotting what to say,
you're formulating an alibi.

510
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,878
Look, excuse us for a second.

511
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,913
Can I talk to you outside, please?

512
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,521
- What are you doing?
- What?

513
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,501
This is Sunshine Beach, not "CSI."
You need to lighten up a little bit.

514
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,231
I'm sorry
if I came on too strong.

515
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,263
It's just wearing down the perp
is how I caught the Cycle Stalker.

516
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,571
- Who's that?
- He stole over 100 motorcycles.

517
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,636
I chased him down 14 blocks on foot
and then I tackled him.

518
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,305
- 14 blocks?
- Yeah.

519
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,543
I was captain of the track team
in high school.

520
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,313
It's probably one of the reasons
why they wanted me to replace you.

521
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,218
I'm like the younger version
of you.

522
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,780
( Ringtone beeps )

523
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,620
- Something wrong, sir?
- No. Maybe.

524
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,631
A potential owner for my son's dog
is gonna be in my house.

525
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,963
If you want, you know, I can go down
to the station and analyze

526
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,526
the fingerprints on the gloves
while you deal with family business.

527
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,902
Whatever you need,
I'm there.

528
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,407
Whatever I need? Hmm.

529
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,237
( Knocks )

530
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,046
My dad called.
You must be Detective Juniper.

531
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,312
Jasper.

532
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,978
Ready to meet
Chilly Christmas?

533
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,011
Delighted.

534
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,688
Here he is.

535
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,035
This is how you want
your dog to look?

536
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,568
Look, nothing against your
canine fashion sense, kid,

537
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,410
but no one's gonna want a dog
that looks so...

538
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,347
- Ridiculous?
- Dorky?

539
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,648
Both. Your dad put me in charge.
Lose the outfit.

540
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,025
(whines)

541
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,514
(whines)

542
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,127
You too, come on.
Whoo! Feel the burn.

543
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,787
(giggling )

544
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,355
Come on, arms up.
Arms up. Arms up.

545
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,231
Come on, guys.

546
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,794
Down on all fours.

547
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,211
(Chilly whines)

548
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,747
(sirens wailing)

549
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,361
Anything yet?

550
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,327
Well, I got a partial fingerprint,
but not enough to make a match.

551
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,362
- Dead end?
- Not exactly.

552
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,568
What do you mean?

553
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,134
This glove
is an Enzo Vattagio,

554
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,147
men's size extra-large.
They run about $3000 a pair--

555
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,844
not the typical accessory
you'd find on a dog thief, however.

556
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,945
So the question is, where is this guy?
He's probably 200 miles away.

557
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,048
No, I don't think so.
I don't think he's finished yet.

558
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,083
In fact, I think
he's right under our noses.

559
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,790
Caps:
Good job, Chilly.

560
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,895
Bobby:
Chilly, we did it.

561
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:26,306
Good afternoon. I'm here about
your Internet post on canine adoptions.

562
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,071
I would like nothing more
than to give

563
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,443
your rare Korean Sapsali
a warm, loving home.

564
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,778
You have the wrong house, sir.

565
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,715
This isn't 35 Bay-side Ridge?

566
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,686
Oh. Um, no.

567
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,154
- No, it's not.
- But it says so right there.

568
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,157
Sorry, Bobby.
He's good.

569
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,636
I'm sorry. Allow me to save you
from their juvenile antics.

570
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,007
So you're interested
in adopting the dog?

571
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,534
Absolutely.

572
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,808
Since our sweet little dog
Pickles passed on,

573
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:08,181
my three-year-old daughter Rebecca
has cried herself to sleep every night.

574
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,550
So do you like Chilly?

575
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,413
He's perfect.

576
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,221
We live on a beautiful,
huge farm

577
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,592
with lots of room for dogs
to run and play.

578
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,723
And of course I would pay you
handsomely for Chilly.

579
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,131
Jasper: Tell you what-- how about
I contact the owner right now,

580
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,103
and you can meet him.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

581
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,231
- Mr...
- Oh, my name? Uh, Nickels.

582
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:33,174
- Jasper Harris.
- So are you a neighbor?

583
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,110
Oh, no, I'm his replacement at
the Sunshine Beach Police Department.

584
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,774
He's moving to New York City next week
to join the FBI.

585
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,579
Wow, the FBI.
That's impressive.

586
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,177
Whoa, look at the time.

587
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,882
I gotta take my daughter Leticia
to a piano lesson.

588
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,084
Wait, I thought your daughter's name
was Rebecca.

589
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,992
You're a very observant little boy,
aren't you?

590
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,656
Of course I was talking about
my other daughter.

591
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,961
Well, it's been a pleasure
meeting you guys.

592
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,990
I'll be in touch.

593
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,398
( Door closes )

594
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,839
That guy was weird.

595
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,536
That's for sure.

596
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,317
What was the inside
of their house like?

597
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,755
Oh, did they have, like, a really big
Christmas tree or anything?

598
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,816
Where's the dog?

599
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,385
Complications,
to say the least.

600
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,227
The father of the house
is a constable.

601
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,255
Constable-

602
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,064
you know,
I had that too once.

603
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,730
I couldn't get off the toilet seat
for, like, an hour. It was terrible.

604
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,173
"Constable" in this case means
"Federal lawman," Mr. Hale,

605
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,542
the same way that "Hale"
means "idiotic fool."

606
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,511
So what's next?

607
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,846
Well, when I was on Wall Street,

608
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,079
and someone wouldn't
sell their company,

609
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,917
we'd do a hostile takeover.
So, gentlemen...

610
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,588
I guess it's time
to get hostile.

611
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,328
So you mean to tell me
that none of the prospective owners

612
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,631
- were any good today?
- Nope.

613
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:09,035
- Not even a little bit?
- Nada.

614
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,562
- Did you give them a chance?
- Nope.

615
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,597
- Aha!
- Dad, that wasn't fair.

616
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,407
You used that Jedi-mind-trick
detective interrogation thing on me.

617
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,038
That's right.

618
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,549
Are you sure you don't want
any help with that?

619
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,278
Cooking's not exactly
your thing.

620
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,048
I think you're right, buddy. I gotta
learn how to take care of myself.

621
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,885
Hey, you know something?
When you were little,

622
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,016
your mom used to prepare
a food theme

623
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,684
every night of the week
during Christmas.

624
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,717
- What kind of themes?
- Well, you know,

625
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,788
like she'd make a pear tart
for "partridge in a pear tree."

626
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,597
Or for "three French hens," we'd have
Cornish game hen, that kind of thing.

627
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,194
So what's the theme
for tonight?

628
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,330
( Hissing )

629
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,863
Whoa.

630
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,605
Clearly, tonight's theme is "seven
swans a-swimming in a grease fire."

631
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,511
You really miss her,
don't you, Dad?

632
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:59,009
Yeah... I do.

633
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,421
But you know what?
I'm lucky,

634
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,085
because I get to see her every day
when I look at you.

635
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,686
Oh!

636
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:12,224
I am making one heck of a mess.
You'd better take over, sport.

637
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,065
That's a good idea.

638
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,061
( Rapping )

639
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
Cole:
It's Lieutenant Stone.

640
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,114
- Hey, come on in.
- Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

641
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,743
I have a list of the stolen dogs
from the last kennel.

642
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,582
I tried to call you
on your cell phone, but--

643
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,610
Hey, Lieutenant Mel.

644
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,645
Hey, Bobby.

645
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,250
Anyway"
( sniffs )

646
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,283
Are you-- are you cooking?

647
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,854
Yeah, yeah, that's--

648
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,332
that's my attempt.
Are you busy right now?

649
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,768
- Come, come, come, come.
- Yeah, it smells really, really bad.

650
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,335
(whimpers)

651
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,144
So tell me how a tough cop like you
became an Iron Chef.

652
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,809
Stone: You don't know
that story?

653
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,116
My parents owned the most popular
restaurant in Little Italy.

654
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,588
It was their life.

655
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,613
Cole:
Now you're telling me this?

656
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,560
I would have had you come over
to prepare dinner a long time ago.

657
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,790
I love Italian.
I'm Italian.

658
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:22,264
Shh. Not a sound, Chilly,
or we're both in trouble.

659
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,276
So why didn't you become a chef
like your parents?

660
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,073
When I was 19,

661
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,081
thieves broke into my parents'
restaurant and stole everything.

662
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,016
And they couldn't afford to rebuild it,
so they had to close it.

663
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,350
And a week later I enrolled
into the police academy,

664
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,550
because I was gonna catch
those guys no matter what.

665
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,287
- Did you catch them?
- Not exactly.

666
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,818
But my partner tracked them down
and got the arrest.

667
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,626
You mean my mom.

668
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,654
I mean your mom.

669
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,692
I told you, Bobby, your mom was
a much better cop than I ever was.

670
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,670
Don't tell my new
partner that, okay?

671
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,502
Jasper? He's kind of weird.

672
00:39:57,528 --> 00:39:59,474
Jasper's a little weird,
but he's a good guy

673
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,374
and everybody needs
a partner sometimes, huh?

674
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,401
- ( barks)
- ( coughs)

675
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,040
Sorry, I have a barking cough.

676
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,880
It's going around school.
( coughs )

677
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,682
You're on winter break, son.

678
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,017
It lingers.

679
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,579
( Barks)

680
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,649
What?

681
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,183
Aww. Oh, you're so cute.

682
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,492
Do me a favor, take Chilly
outside right now, okay?

683
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,897
Oh, for crying out loud,
let Chilly stay inside.

684
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,663
- He'll destroy everything.
- That's an order, Detective.

685
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,668
I like it
when she does that.

686
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,832
Hmm.

687
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,668
There you go.

688
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:40,682
Wow, I've never seen you
like this before, Stone--

689
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,706
gourmet chef, dog lover.

690
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,380
I always wanted a dog, but, you know,
puppies are so much work.

691
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:46,911
Mm-hmm.

692
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,355
What?

693
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,484
Well, I mean,
he's not a puppy anymore.

694
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,859
And he needs a loving home
with a loving person.

695
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,694
Are you suggesting
what I think you're suggesting-

696
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,927
- that I take Chilly with me?
- Dad.

697
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,958
It'd be like keeping him
in the family, right?

698
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,834
Besides, it'll make Bobby
so happy

699
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,363
knowing that he's with somebody
that really loves him. Right, Bobby?

700
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,467
- Well, sure, but--
- Stone, come on.

701
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,603
Clearly, you love the dog.
And he loves you.

702
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,614
Just take him, please.
It'll make our Christmas.

703
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,479
Huh?

704
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,644
Okay, okay.

705
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,517
Of course I will, Patrick,
of course.

706
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,988
Oh, I love you.
Thank you.

707
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,651
Bobby, is that the greatest
Christmas present in the world? Right?

708
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,683
We got a new home for Chilly.

709
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,451
It's great.

710
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,432
It's horrible.

711
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,765
So your dad decided to give Chilly
to Lieutenant Mel?

712
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,703
And now we're going
to New York.

713
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,533
I'm never gonna see my best friend
ever again.

714
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,177
Some Christmas miracle, huh?

715
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,206
Cole:
Bobby, I'm leaving.

716
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,914
So I'll be back later, buddy.
Do me a favor,

717
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:56,390
could you pack a little bit
until I get home, please?

718
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,415
- I will.
- And remember...

719
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,952
You and Mrs. Hepacott
are watching me. I know.

720
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:14,136
Too bad Chilly'-s an outdoor dog
too messy for inside.

721
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,166
Yeah.

722
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,702
Wait a minute.

723
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,648
Wait a minute.

724
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,651
Wait a minute.

725
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,950
If Chilly learns how to behave
in a New York apartment,

726
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,651
get his food and his exercise
and keep everything clean,

727
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,682
Dad would have to
take him with us.

728
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,252
But he can't do those things.

729
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,066
- We'll have to retrain him how.
- Are you kidding?

730
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,434
To be a dog trainer,
you have to be tough.

731
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,461
You have to be fearless.

732
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,203
You literally have to think
like a dog.

733
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,972
We don't know anyone
like that.

734
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:50,774
Maybe we do.

735
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,077
( Chuckles )
You said it yourself-

736
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:55,344
she bites like a dog.

737
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,444
Dude, don't even think about

738
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:02,150
thinking about
who I know you're thinking about.

739
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,791
You think?
(chuckles)

740
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,386
Oh.

741
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,730
-( Beeping )
- Okay, alarm and motion detector

742
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,031
deactivated.

743
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,538
Your dad's phone won't pick up
a single thing.

744
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,665
Awesome, Caps.

745
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,108
Okay, ladies, gentlemen,

746
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,044
- thank you for coming.
- Don't get excited.

747
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,742
I'm here 'cause you told me
I get a free lunch.

748
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,977
Caps: Yeah, and all
you gave us so far

749
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,145
are carrot sticks.

750
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,177
Without ranch dressing.

751
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,884
I don't do carrots
without ranch.

752
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:41,385
I will give you guys some
ranch dressing, okay? I promise.

753
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,955
But will you get us lunch?

754
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:47,128
Because carrots
and ranch alone

755
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,763
are technically an appetizer.

756
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,943
Welcome to Operation Christmas Miracle,
phase two.

757
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,972
What happened to phase one?

758
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,644
( Whistles )

759
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,381
( imitates explosion )

760
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,411
Our job..

761
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:11,620
Turn Chilly Christmas
into an indoor dog.

762
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,890
Uh-huh, and how are you gonna
pull that one off?

763
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,954
We will accomplish this task

764
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,398
by identifying
and teaching Chilly

765
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,424
the four main components

766
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,494
of a successful indoor dog.

767
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,473
Since we will not have
a huge yard outside,

768
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,636
Chilly will have to learn
how to exercise indoors.

769
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:32,808
(slurping )

770
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,806
All right, I'm out of here.

771
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,387
( Beeps )

772
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:49,158
Okay, so taking into account
the square footage of your property

773
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,223
and how many meters per second
Chilly can run,

774
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,531
I've preprogrammed
a workout regimen

775
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,935
which can keep him
at the exact same level

776
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,961
of cardiovascular conditioning

777
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,407
he can sustain
if living outdoors.

778
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,269
What's all that supposed
to mean?

779
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,745
I turned it on.

780
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,476
Then why isn't he moving?

781
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,508
The treadmill will begin
with the forward velocity of the user.

782
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,178
Meaning, he has to run.

783
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:18,023
Jeez, does anyone here pay attention
during science class?

784
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,391
No.

785
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:23,788
Bobby, I think there's a better way
of doing this.

786
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,960
Okay, Chilly,
on the count of three.

787
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:30,335
One, two, three.

788
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,238
Run, dash, sprint!

789
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,508
(whines)

790
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,644
Since all meals will be indoors,

791
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,917
Chilly will have to learn
how to access food and water

792
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,550
on his own,
without making a mess.

793
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,860
I call it
the Canine Cuisine-inator-

794
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,094
the ultimate self-feeding
and watering device

795
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,366
- for the discriminating doggie.
- Wow, Caps, I'm actually impressed.

796
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,635
- Well, thank you, thank you.
- You built this in one day for Chilly?

797
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,268
Well, not exactly.

798
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:11,472
I built it for my grandpa
for whenever we leave the house,

799
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,745
except for him it's filled with
warm milk and mashed potatoes.

800
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,215
So how does it work?

801
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,722
Simplicity in itself.

802
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,351
Chilly wants water-- he simply
taps his paw against the step here.

803
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,797
And same with the food.
One foot on the step,

804
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,099
take it off-- and pre-measured
amount of doggie diet.

805
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:38,873
Okay, Chilly.
Your turn, Chilly.

806
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,842
You thirsty, boy?
You thirsty?

807
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,239
He's doing it. It works.
Come on, boy.

808
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,213
Uh, that's enough
water, Chilly.

809
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,947
Chilly, just move your foot.

810
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,388
Bobby, I think there's a better way
of doing this.

811
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,392
Move your foot, Chilly.

812
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,959
- I'll disconnect it.
- Wait, no. Watch out for the--

813
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,794
- Aghh!
- (crashes)

814
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,823
...water.

815
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,260
I have to warn you,

816
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,773
this next lesson
might be kind of...

817
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,833
- Dangerous?
- ( giggles)

818
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,141
No, more like
kind of gross.

819
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,044
There's no way
you're getting me

820
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,212
in that bathroom
with that dog.

821
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,586
(Caps snickers)

822
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,984
Kizzy, we need it.

823
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,633
I'm no expert scientist
on dog pooping,

824
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,199
but shouldn't that
toilet seat be up?

825
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,679
Patience.

826
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,047
I just want to make sure that he
gets used to sitting up there first.

827
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,211
And then I'll teach him
how to use the tissue.

828
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,346
Just make sure
you teach him how to flush.

829
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,378
Never thought I'd say this,

830
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,085
but this makes me
miss school.

831
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,459
What if he does his business

832
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,761
on top of the toilet seat?

833
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,460
He won't.

834
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,661
(whines)

835
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,928
Oh, gross.

836
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,309
And now the final lesson.

837
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,519
And most important of all,
Chilly will have to learn

838
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,751
how to maneuver
around the house

839
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,555
without breaking stuff.

840
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,756
Yeah, right.
This I'd like to see.

841
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,026
( Both chuckle)

842
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,056
Bobby:
I've set up what I'd like to call

843
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,501
the 100-yard doggie dash.

844
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,472
Chilly has to get through
all six obstacles

845
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,304
without breaking
any of the ornaments

846
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,402
and then-- boom!
right on through to the finish.

847
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,538
( Whistle tweets )

848
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,071
Kids: Go, Chilly!
Go. 90. 90. 90. 90!

849
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,742
Oh.

850
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,754
-( Crashing )
- Oh, no. Oh.

851
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,687
Bobby:
Chilly-- oh, no.

852
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,423
No. no, no, no.

853
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,485
Careful.
Watch out for that--

854
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,429
-( clattering )
- Come on. Oh.

855
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,220
Hey, Sam.
Thanks for meeting us.

856
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:51,726
( Police radio chatter)

857
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,501
(toy squeaks )

858
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,740
Boy, they really
picked this place apart.

859
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,774
All right, rookie,
let's break down the crime scene.

860
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,804
What do you have?

861
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,115
Well, based on the deep scratch marks
on the door frame

862
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,953
and the fact that this is a Clark-370
deadbolt with a five-pin tumbler,

863
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,322
I'd say the perps used
a tension wrench,

864
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,691
anchoring a secure piece
of slump metal.

865
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,697
Then they bypassed the alarm system
using a wave jammer.

866
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,596
It's definitely a professional
break-in-

867
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,560
( grunts softly )

868
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,629
That's impressive, Detective,

869
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,662
very impressive.

870
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,700
Unfortunately,
you're completely wrong.

871
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:39,611
While the front is indeed
a five-pin tumbler,

872
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,775
the back door is a simple
two-pin lock

873
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,411
which you'll find on any ordinary
apartment door.

874
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,682
Those can be opened
by a simple turn of the key.

875
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,917
So they had the key?

876
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,947
The rest was just for show.

877
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:54,360
The suspects wanted everybody to think
this was a high-tech job.

878
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,386
So the perp didn't want anyone
to know he had a key

879
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,425
because the perp was the one
most likely person with a key.

880
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,066
A locksmith.

881
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,734
You have potential, Jasper.

882
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,606
Get some ice on that.

883
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,542
( Moans )
I'm okay.

884
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,019
(whines)

885
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,020
I don't mean to be
a pessimist here-

886
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,120
Uh, what's a pessimist?

887
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,131
Somebody who thinks
we're doomed.

888
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,495
Be a pessimist.
We're doomed.

889
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,768
(whimpers)

890
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:43,005
Some winter break.
I'd rather go out and play.

891
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,408
Hey, what are you doing?

892
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,681
I didn't do that.

893
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,848
This is no time
to play games

894
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,551
unless you're-

895
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,719
(whimpers, barks)

896
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:08,065
Play games.

897
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,430
What are you doing?

898
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,670
I knew there was a better way.
Don't you get it?

899
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,179
That's the answer to
Operation Christmas Miracle-

900
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,680
Play games.

901
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,344
( Machine buzzing )

902
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,652
(door chimes jingle)

903
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,851
( phone ringing )

904
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,592
Excuse me.

905
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,623
Sorry to bother you.

906
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,227
I have been in and out of locksmiths'
all day long.

907
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:46,105
I'm Detective Cole.
I'm looking for a Mr. Quartermain.

908
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:48,370
Quarterman.
Michael Quarterman.

909
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:51,174
Nice to meet you, Detective.
What can I do for you today?

910
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,203
Did you lock your keys
in your patrol car?

911
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,238
( laughs)

912
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,684
That's funny because it's true.
I have done that.

913
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:02,087
But no, I have a couple questions
I'd like to ask you if you don't mind.

914
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,490
I believe you have a contract

915
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:06,391
with the Sunshine Beach Plaza.
Is that correct?

916
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,918
Indeed I do.

917
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,862
And you have access
to several stores-

918
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:13,766
a women's shoe store, a card store
and a pet store, I think.

919
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,497
My brother handles
that job for me.

920
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,096
I'm not a big fan of pets-
you know, the mess,

921
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,540
the lack of discipline,
the disgusting odor.

922
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,977
I gotta ask you, if given a choice,
who really wants to clean up poop?

923
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,810
( laughs )
I'm not gonna argue with that.

924
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,282
But, you know, pets,
dogs in general-

925
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,809
they're pretty good companions,
I'd say, especially for kids.

926
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,185
Well then, I'm not overly fond
of children either

927
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,781
for pretty much
the same reason.

928
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,621
Listen, I got a busy
afternoon, Detective.

929
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:39,320
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

930
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,158
No, no, that's gonna be it.

931
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,460
I guess I'll let you get back
to locksmithing.

932
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,961
But before I go,
I'm moving to New York

933
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,369
and I'd like to get that sophisticated
big-city look that you've got going.

934
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,670
And would you happen to know
where I could buy one of these?

935
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,699
It's about your size, isn't it?

936
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,043
It's a Vattagio, very nice.

937
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,050
I don't shop locally,
so I'd have no idea.

938
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,074
Okay.

939
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,713
Well, thank you very much,
Mr. Quarterman.

940
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,245
Thank you.

941
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,724
- Merry Christmas.
- It's gonna be.

942
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,619
(door chimes jingle)

943
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,528
It's me.

944
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:21,661
Your boss. Who did you think
it was-- Santa Claus?

945
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,433
You probably did.
Listen, you got sloppy at the pet store

946
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,463
now everything's escalated.

947
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:29,272
That cop's dog is worth more
than the other dogs combined.

948
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:32,041
I need to know the status
immediately.

949

Kizzy: We are going about this
all the wrong way.

951
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:46,016
Why does Chilly tear everything up
while he's inside?

952
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,394
Scientists say high brain functions
in canines are underdeveloped-

953
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:52,457
Bzz-zz. Wrong.

954
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,265
It's because
he likes to play games.

955

( Barks)

956
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,238
I think she's right.

957
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,765
Duh. Of course I'm right.

958
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,473
Anyway, we turn all these
lessons into a game,

959
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:09,473
and bing, bang, boom!
you've got an indoor dog.

960
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:13,719
Kizzy, you're brilliant.

961
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,381

the five, four, three, two, one. ♪

1025
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,822
(toy squeaking )

1026
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,320
We're supposed to be working,
not playing with toys.

1027
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,630
This is all the stuff
we stole from the pet store.

1028
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:49,068
I thought the dogs could
play with it on the flight.

1029
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:50,935
Oh, check this out, man.
It's a dog whistle.

1030
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,735
Can you hear anything
on that microphone?

1031
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,708
I can't tell what those kids
are up to in there.

1032
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,540
Well, yeah.
Bobby and Kizzy and Caps

1033
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,239
are teaching Chilly
a bunch of new tricks

1034
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,714
so he could be an indoor dog
so Bobby could take him to New York.

1035
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,683
Wait, you even know
their names?

1036
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,447
Well, yeah. Keeping Chilly
is Bobby's Christmas miracle wish.

1037
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,250
I really hope it comes true.

1038
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,154
You idiot,
we're gangsters.

1039
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,852
It's our job to make sure
the kid's wish doesn't come true.

1040
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,589
You mean in this scenario
we're the Grinch?

1041
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,961
If that kid talks his dad into
bringing that mutt to New York,

1042
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,899
then we can't steal it.
Then we don't get our money.

1043
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:21,903
That's not to mention
all the nasty things

1044
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,963
Quarterman will do to us
if we screw this deal up.

( laughs)

1051
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,320
Now that's odd.

1052
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,355
Hey, blow the whistle again.

1053
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,958
But it doesn't make a sound.
Hello.

1054
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,903
It makes a sound at a frequency
only dogs can hear.

1055
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,599
Just blow it!

1056
00:59:58,628 --> 00:59:59,800

- What? What is it?

1060
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,916
Oh, I think I found a way

1061
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,791
of making our little
Christmas miracle come true.

1062
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,798
It's not even Christmas Eve.
Why are we making a fancy dinner?

1063
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:33,705
Because we are
gonna be spending

1064
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,176
most of our Christmas Day
packing up for the move, buddy.

1065
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,941
And I wanted to spend some
quality time with my favorite guys.

1066
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,845
Gosh, thanks, Lieutenant.

1067
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,781
Well, not you--

1068
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,046
you're welcome, Detective.

1069
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,917
Actually, I'm glad
everybody's here.

1070
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:49,048
Bingo, by the way.

1071
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:52,525
After dinner I've got some
pretty cool things to show you guys.

1072
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,688
A pretty cool thing, huh?
I can't wait to see that.

1073
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,901
( Barks)

1074
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,952
Everything points
to Quarterman.

1075
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,978
Former New York
stockbroker,

1076
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,013
then a suspect
in a bank fraud scheme.

1077
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,993
He lost everything
and yet he can still afford

1078
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,858
a millionaire's wardrobe
as a locksmith.

1079
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,727
He had access
to the pet store.

1080
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:32,130
We have no prints,
no physical evidence.

1081
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,365
- This guy looks familiar.
- Only two more days.

1082
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:39,601
- You're gonna be missed, Cole.
- You too, Stone.

1083
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,631
( Door opens )

1084
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,541
Hey, hey, Bobby, come on,
you know the rules

1085
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:46,069
- about bringing Chilly into the house.
- Not to worry, Dad.

1086
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,241
You're talking about
the old Chilly Christmas.

1087
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,741
But now I'd like to introduce to you
the new Chilly Christmas-

1088
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,776
indoor dog.

1089
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,723
- Prepare to be amazed.
- Oh, yeah.

1090
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,956
Hand me the dog whistle.
If it does what you say it does,

1091
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,934
he'll probably send him right to
the pound and for $5 we'll get him out.

1092
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,063
It's almost Christmas Eve. Isn't there
another way we could do this?

1093
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,370
Indeed there is. I could stroll
in there, identify you two

1094
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,899
as the thieves that broke into
three dog pounds and a pet store.

1095
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,344
You'll be arrested
and I'll bring in two new blokes

1096
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,473
who are complete imbeciles.
Would you prefer to do it that way?

1097
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:25,953
And now for the ultimate demonstration
of indoor Chilly'-s talents...

1098
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:28,717
He will maneuver himself
through the entire living room,

1099
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,282
full speed, without breaking
a single thing.

1100
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:34,090
That's it, Bobby.
You did it.

1101
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,996
No, Kizzy, we did it.

1102
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,672
I have a feeling
this is gonna be fun.

1103
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,074
( Whistle tweets )

1104
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,503
( high-pitched whistle
squeals )

1105
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,175
- Stone: What's wrong with him?
- Come here. No.

1106
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:58,014
All: Chilly, where are you going?
Chilly?

1107
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,815
Come on, calm down.
Chilly, Chilly.

1108
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:01,844
Cole: Okay, I think he wants
to go outside.

1109
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,449
Kids: Come on, Chilly.
Chilly, where are you going?

1110
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,823
No, Chilly, no.

1111
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,992
-( Squealing continues)
- All: Chilly, no. Chilly.

1112
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,725
Cole: All right, all right,
I got him. I got him.

1113
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,359
Wait, I don't got him.
I don't got him.

1114
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,236
(all shouting )

1115
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,207
- Bobby: Chilly, no.
-( crashing )

1116
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,142
- Oh.
- Bobby: Oh, no.

1117
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,339
Not the trophy.

1118
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:27,439
Perfect.

1119
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,284
(Chilly whimpers)

1120
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:38,650
Cole: And this is why I think
it's better if he stays outside.

1121
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:45,997
Mission accomplished.
Let's go.

1122
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,840

Quarterman.

Wait, the plane's coming now?
That's too soon, sir.

1136

Understood.

1137

Good news?

1138
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,832
The plane leaves
in two hours.

1139
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:37,367
We have to get the Cole dog now
or the whole deal's off.

1140
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,402
Now? It's Christmas Eve.

1141
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,381
That detective is gonna be
at home with the dog.

1142
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:43,441
And detectives have guns.
I saw it on TV.

1143
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,782
Detective Cole will not be home.

1144
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,412
How?

1145
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,116
Who are you calling?

1146
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,749
The police, of course.

1147
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:59,625
Bobby, we just got
an anonymous call

1148
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:02,568
that the dog thieves are gonna
hit up another kennel downtown today,

1149
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,832
so I-.

1150
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,033
What's the matter, buddy?
Sit down.

1151
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,774
You did your best.
Chilly knows that.

1152
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:21,047
I know. I just...

1153
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:26,250
wanted to save him.

1154
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,058
You know? Be a hero...

1155
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:31,622
like you.

1156
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,592
Well...

1157
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,333
you don't got to be anything
but yourself.

1158
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:43,733
( Cell phone beeps )

1159
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:50,009
Look, I gotta go. okay?

1160
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,144
Make sure
you lock the door, please?

1161
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:57,421
( Door opens, closes )

1162
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,704
(dogs barking within )

1163
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,455
There's a kid and a dog.
It's easy.

1164
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:31,424
Lock the kid in the closet if you
have to, grab the dog and get out.

1165
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:34,257
And don't even think of
coming back here without him.

1166
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,058
- The kid?
- The dog!

1167
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,195
You had to open your mouth.

1168
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:43,396
I was just clarifying.
What's wrong with clarifying?

1169
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,428
(dogs barking. Whining)

1170

Stone:
Anything?

1172
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,252
Not a peep.

1173
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,483
All clear.

1174
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,250
What is it?

1175
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,763
I don't know.
Something just doesn't feel right.

1176
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,824
Jasper, call the office
and see if you can get a trace

1177
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,699
on who called in
that anonymous tip.

1178
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,930
I'm on it.

1179
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:22,606
( Sighs )
It's our last lunch together, pal.

1180
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,634
You should have
something good.

1181
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,048
( Gate creaks )

1182
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,646
I'm sorry, pal.
I really thought this could work.

1183
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,819
I wanted this to be
our Christmas miracle,

1184
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,058
like the time it snowed
for the first time in Sunshine Beach.

1185
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,156
I'm really sorry.

1186
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,499
(whines)

1187
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,008
More than anything,
I really wanted to show you

1188
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:01,446
that I could be as good a friend to you
as you've been to me.

1189
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,654
Claus-sen:
That takes care of the alarm.

1190
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:11,680
And that takes care
of the phone.

1191
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:30,668
Come on, Chilly.

1192
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,727
Wow, now this is a beautiful
Christmas tree.

1193
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,759
Shh.

1194
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:02,406
Oh my gosh, it's one of those
plastic Wiffle ball bats.

1195
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,570
I've always, always wanted
one of these,

1196
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,602
but my mom
couldn't afford it.

1197
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,879
She probably wouldn't be
too proud of me right now.

1198
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,908
For the last time,

1199
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:16,355
can I please do the job
I've been hired to do

1200
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,291
without being subjected
to your romantic ramblings

1201
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:22,694
about a stupid holiday
centered around a fat man with a beard,

1202
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:26,530
when all I want to do
is steal the flipping dog from the kid?

1203
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,966
( Clatters )

1204
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,798
Uh, Merry Christmas?

1205
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,872
Come on, Chilly, run!

1206
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,936
Get him!

1207
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,970
Jasper: All right,
did you say 7th Street?

1208
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,005
All right, copy that.
Thank you very much.

1209
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,040
The tip came
from a cell phone

1210
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,021
somewhere around the 500 block
of 7th Street downtown.

1211
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,750
500 block of 7th Street?

1212
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:52,520
That's about four blocks
from Quarterman's locksmith office.

1213
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:55,051
Hey, do you still have
that file on Quarterman?

1214
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,086
Of course.
It's in the car.

1215
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,964
Is that a dog whistle?

1216
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,067
Yes, sir.

1217
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,100
We use them
for silent commands.

1218
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,307
How would that affect a dog
that wasn't used to working with one?

1219
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,247
Depends on the breed, sir.

1220
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,842
Do you mind if I see it
for a second?

1221
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,185
Sure.

1222
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,213
Thank you.

1223
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,989
(dogs barking within )

1224
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,395
What's going on over there?

1225
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:37,267
A dog whistle.

1226
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,603
I think that's why
Chilly was going crazy last night.

1227
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,369
Somebody was blowing
a dog whistle.

1228
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,240
I remember this guy.

1229
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,508
The picture's a little old, but he's
the guy that came to your house.

1230
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:48,947
- Who?
- Quarterman. He tried to buy Chilly.

1231
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,008
Bobby.

1232
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,107
Come on, let's go.

1233
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,686
(toilet flushes )

1234
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,718
It's the kid.

1235
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,892
How do you know
it's not just the dog?

1236
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,699
Well, unless he's a magic
toilet-flushing dog from the circus,

1237
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:13,070
I'm pretty sure it's the kid.

1238
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:16,338
Boss said secure the kid first.
You go down to the end of the hallway,

1239
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,606
- stop the dog from escaping.
- Okay.

1240
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,341
I'm coming in, kid.

1241
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,378
Behave yourself
and nobody gets hurt--

1242
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,890
well, not much anyway.

1243
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:49,237
(whimpers)

1244
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,002
Now I've seen everything.

1245
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,848
(grunts)

1246
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,152
-( barks)
- (gurgles)

1247
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,658
Come on, Chilly.

1248
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:11,094
- Hale: Hey, hey, come here, come here.
- Bobby: Chilly.

1249
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,656
Hale:
Stop running.

1250
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,766
Hey, come here,
you little-- oh!

1251
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,701
Bobby:
Run, Chilly, run.

1252
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,970
Jasper: I should have recognized
Quarterman earlier.

1253
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,344
It's my first case
and now your son's in danger.

1254
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:28,939
I don't think I'm gonna be
much of a replacement.

1255
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,644
Don't worry.
We're gonna save my son.

1256
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,709
(siren wailing)

1257
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,384
Um...

1258
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:43,619
Chilly, do you remember
the obstacle course, buddy?

1259
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,822
One, two, three, go!

1260
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,372
( Waltz music plays )

1261
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,982
How difficult is it
to grab a dog?

1262
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,952
Come on.

1263
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,627
(thumps)

1264
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:32,477
( crashes )

1265
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,574
Oh, no. We're trapped.

1266
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,249
Chilly, what are you doing?

1267
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,127
( Clatters )

1268
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,362
Way to go, Chilly.

1269
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,870
( Panting )

1270
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:04,468
I'm really sorry
about all this.

1271
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,342
I think you two
better get going.

1272
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:10,407
Hey, here's hoping
your Christmas miracle comes true.

1273
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,019
Christmas miracle?
I don't think so.

1274
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,293
Come on, Chilly, run!

1275
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:31,429
Cole: To all available units,
all available units,

1276
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,804
we are code four
to the location on your screens.

1277
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,002
Suspects are to be considered
armed and dangerous.

1278
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,068
- ( Tires screech )
-( crossing bells ringing )

1279
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,773
We are stuck.

1280
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,913
- I have a confession to make.
- Now?

1281
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,944
I'm not a hero.

1282
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:52,789
L-- I didn't tackle
the Cycle Stalker.

1283
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:55,920
I tripped and I fell on top of him
and I knocked us both out cold.

1284
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,488
You weren't on the track team
either, were you?

1285
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,557
I was on the chess team.

1286
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:03,759
It's all right, Jasper.

1287
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:06,136
You're a good cop.
You're gonna save my kid.

1288
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,540
This is Cole.
We're blocked in right now.

1289
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,603
We need about 60 seconds.

1290
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:17,811
- Make that 30.
-( siren wailing)

1291
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,043
Um...

1292
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,925
- You'd better stop.
-( Chilly growling)

1293
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,260
You're making Chilly mad.

1294
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:31,787
I'm walking out of here
with that dog.

1295
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,757
Sometimes in life
we must accept failure,

1296
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,395
so my advice to you--

1297
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,872
lock yourself in the restroom
after the dog and I leave.

1298
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,000
That way you could tell everyone
that you're a hero

1299
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:45,637
and no one will ever know
that you're just a scared little boy.

1300
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,875
- ( Growls )
- Time to go, doggie.

1301
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:57,554
Gotcha.

1302
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,293
(screaming)
No!

1303
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:22,341
Listen, you stay away
from my friend.

1304
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:25,942
Police department!
Nobody move!

1305
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,982
Officers, secure the two
in the kitchen.

1306
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,927
Good job, rookie.

1307
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:37,931
- Thanks, Dad.
- It was courageous what you did.

1308
01:17:37,953 --> 01:17:40,490
-( Chilly barks)
- My partner needed me.

1309
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:44,129
Looks like you're gonna have to
get used to another hero in the house.

1310
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,548
That's an amazing dog.

1311
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,717
It's not just a dog.
It's his friend.

1312
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,318
Bobby's voice:
My best friend.

1313
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:13,162
By the time Christmas Day
rolled around a few hours later,

1314
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,658
Sunshine Beach had the second
Christmas miracle in history...

1315
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,262
with a fresh blanket

1316
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:19,863
of new Christmas snow.

1317
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,998
This year, it seems,

1318
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,375
everybody got the perfect present.

1319
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,883
Christmas. It's go time.

1320
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:39,756
( Barks)

1321
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,726
What's this?

1322
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:51,636
And every man needs one of these
on Christmas morning.

1323
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,662
Thank you very much, Chilly.

1324
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,039
What happened to your bat?

1325
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,635
Well, it's sort of a long story.

1326
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,045
-( laughs )
- Stone: Merry Christmas.

1327
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,743
Hey, hey, Merry Christmas.

1328
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,351
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi. Bobby.

1329
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:09,377
I'm glad you're here.
I got you something.

1330
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,413
You didn't have to
get me anything.

1331
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:15,223
No, no, that is a must.
I had to get you this.

1332
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,996
You got me confetti.

1333
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:29,532
Actually, that's my
resignation letter

1334
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,511
for the Sunshine Beach Police.

1335
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,438
- You're staying.
- Yeah, I am.

1336
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:39,213
Dad, what about the FBI?

1337
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,653
I told them I needed
another year to think about it.

1338
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:44,919
I mean, it's the FBI, right?
They're not going anywhere.

1339
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,222
Neither am I.

1340
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:53,090
Bobby:
Yuck.

1341
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,362
(Cole laughs)

1342
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:56,562
Gross.

1343
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,703
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
