1
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,370
We are moments away
from the long awaited

2
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:24,760
verdict in the murder trial

3
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,011
of Labor Leader, Tommy Stompanato,

4
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,221
who the media has
labeled the Gucci Goombah

5
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:31,017
for his dapper style of dress.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,992
Straw polls give better
than three to one odds

7
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,009
in favor of his being found
guilty of ordering the murder

8
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:37,300
of his former live-in girlfriend,

9
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:39,409
actress/model Rhonda McCormick.

10
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:56,340
I'm being told that the jury
is back in the courtroom.

11
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,196
We'll bring you the live footage now.

12
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:07,810
All rise.

13
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,237
Court is now in session.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,570
The Honorable Judge Hamilton presiding.

15
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:14,991
Be seated.

16
00:01:24,853 --> 00:01:25,853
We better...

17
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:37,169
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury.

18
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:39,387
So as not to prolong an
already lengthy case,

19
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,303
have the people reached a verdict?

20
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,634
We have, Your Honor.

21
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:02,743
Let the record show

22
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,856
that the verdicts have been signed

23
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,856
and properly formatted.

24
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:15,647
How say you?

25
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:17,946
In the matter of the people versus

26
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,073
Thomas Francis Stompanato,

27
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,979
on the charge of conspiring to murder

28
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:24,040
Rhonda Diane McCormick,

29
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:27,236
we the people find the
defendant, not guilty.

30
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:30,767
Oh my goodness, no.

31
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,303
That's insanity.

32
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,860
What, how could that be?

33
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,402
You son of a bitch.

34
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:44,652
Oh,
better luck next time, kid.

35
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:48,143
So say one, so say you all?

36
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,541
Oh,

37
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:55,923
my God.

38
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,281
I can't believe it, this is incredible.

39
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:11,272
Yeah, I told ya that
was a piece of cake.

40
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:12,381
Hey.

41
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:14,547
Congratulations, Tommy.

42
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:17,117
You always were lucky.

43
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,167
Drop the gun.

44
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,140
The gun, lady.

45
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,709
[James O'Keefe) Hello.

46
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:59,125
Yeah, I just reviewed the tape you sent.

47
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:01,634
No, she's perfect.

48
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,730
I'll handle it from here.

49
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:27,471
Miss McCormick, I'm James O'Keefe.

50
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,025
Excuse me if I don't shake.

51
00:06:30,108 --> 00:06:31,525
You're excused.

52
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,945
Have a seat, I don't bite.

53
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,028
I might.

54
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,487
Guard.

55
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,779
That won't be necessary.

56
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,695
That'll be all please.

57
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,366
Let's see,

58
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,587
McCormick, Tara V.

59
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,584
For Victoria, very pretty.

60
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,656
Five years as an LAPD street cop.

61
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,447
Second into SWAT.

62
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,325
First female to be team element leader,

63
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:07,807
that's very impressive.

64
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,590
Joined DEA in 1993 and terminated

65
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:13,663
after the shooting of a
Columbian drug informant,

66
00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:17,717
who just happened to be a child molester.

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,294
You've been reading my diary?

68
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:20,710
Oh no, not me.

69
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,589
Let's see, you've got a 15 year stint here

70
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:28,137
to pull for the attempted
murder of Tommy Stompanato.

71
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,194
Now just between you and me,

72
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:31,961
I think it's a shame
that the man survived.

73
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:32,862
Who the hell are you?

74
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,102
You don't sound like FBI.

75
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:37,996
Oh, just a overworked,
underpaid civil servant,

76
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,350
at your service.

77
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,724
If you really are a damn spook,

78
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:43,835
why don't you tell me why
Stompanato killed my sister?

79
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,918
You don't know either?

80
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:47,957
No.

81
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,670
Just that he did it.

82
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,115
What, your secret decoder
ring couldn't figure it out?

83
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,424
That's very funny.

84
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,781
No, it didn't.

85
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,396
Look, I'll cut to the bone.

86
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,559
You finish what you
started with Stompanato,

87
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,034
and we wipe the slate clean.

88
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,367
Give you a full pardon and relocate you

89
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,468
to any spot on the map you wanna go.

90
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,856
And I bet if I'm killed or caught,

91
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,294
I'm on my own, right?

92
00:08:10,377 --> 00:08:11,302
Naturally.

93
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:12,441
The problem with you spooks is that

94
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:16,211
you're never around
when the lights come on.

95
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:17,294
Forget it.

96
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,505
Okay, have it your way, Miss McCormick.

97
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:22,976
But if I were you, I'd be more concerned

98
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:26,295
with what goes on around
here when the lights go off.

99
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:29,581
I'm sure I'll be seeing you again.

100
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,109
Help him out.

101
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:52,893
Now get your hands off me.

102
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,550
Whataya think, I'm a
cripple, or something?

103
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,499
Well, what are you waiting for?

104
00:08:57,514 --> 00:08:59,181
Go on, get the bags.

105
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:05,624
Good to be home, huh?

106
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:06,848
It'll work.

107
00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:10,105
I think gotta take a little time off

108
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:12,688
before we go back to business.

109
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,729
Alright Ryker, let's you and me talk.

110
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:27,284
Ah, I thought we outta

111
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,895
wait for a more appropriate time.

112
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,478
Ah, no,

113
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:31,561
right now.

114
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,471
Well, I thought maybe you'd wanna get

115
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,678
settled in before we got back to business.

116
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:38,031
I know what you thought.

117
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:39,998
Wendy, come here.

118
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,081
Come here.

119
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,608
Ah, look at that face.

120
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:48,493
That's a young
lady you're looking at.

121
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:50,602
It means she knows when to keep her eyes

122
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:54,606
and her ears and her mouth shut, right?

123
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,654
Tommy, are you crazy?

124
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:59,538
No women knows how to keep
their mouth shut, for chrissake.

125
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,143
Yeah, but you can learn a lot

126
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:04,627
from a face like that, can't you Frank?

127
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,939
Alright, let's talk.

128
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,901
- Excuse me, Mr. Stompanato?
- What?

129
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,668
You're supposed to take your medication

130
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:14,751
the moment you get home.

131
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:18,945
Alright,

132
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:20,804
half an hour, huh.

133
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:32,920
Do you want me to put the bags away now?

134
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,486
No, why don't you
stand there for a week.

135
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,736
Take the bags.

136
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,712
It's time for you to strip, McCormick.

137
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:30,593
I said,

138
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,079
strip.

139
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,837
I say dance, you better
dance me an Irish gig.

140
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,670
Are we clear on that?

141
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:50,504
This is my favorite part.

142
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:11,187
Now let's see, on the
east side, Ramirez delivered

143
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,611
a 20% increase in the
sale of drugs and weapons.

144
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:17,889
On the south side, Poole
showed a 25% profit

145
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,530
over and above the usual in prostitution,

146
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:23,440
and 20% on drugs and 15 on guns.

147
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:26,976
Chung, on the west side,
stayed pretty much the same.

148
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,702
What am I gonna do with this chink?

149
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:32,005
That's what you get for
dealing with foreigners.

150
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:33,075
Yeah, well, I tell you what,

151
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,027
why don't you send a
couple boys over there

152
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,784
and explain things to him, alright?

153
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,189
I think he'll get the picture.

154
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,098
Yeah, I'll have Big
Apple and Skinny Louie

155
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,173
rework the menu.

156
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:44,077
And as you're aware, today's the first day

157
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,312
of Tara McCormick's term in the pen.

158
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:50,179
Hmm, our eyes and ears ready?

159
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:52,429
Just waiting for orders.

160
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:57,605
Ah, I've
been dreaming about this

161
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,881
since the day I was shot.

162
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:03,321
You know what I'm gonna do to that lady?

163
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,012
I'm gonna gouge her eyes out,

164
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:07,287
and I'm gonna tear her
arms out of the socket,

165
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,683
and I'm gonna tie her
tits in a granny knot.

166
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:11,702
And then I'm gonna get mad.

167
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:12,950
I'm gonna strip her clothes off,

168
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,195
and I'm gonna make her crawl
a mile through broken glass

169
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:16,859
just to kiss my ass,

170
00:13:16,942 --> 00:13:17,960
to beg me

171
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,466
to kill her.

172
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,476
I think that about covers everything.

173
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,271
Remember what the doctor
said, you shouldn't get upset.

174
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:32,362
I just remembered, you got one week

175
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,855
to bust a cap in her ass, capiche?

176
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:38,406
Yeah?

177
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:40,456
Tommy.

178
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,471
Yeah.

179
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:46,611
It's time for your massage.

180
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:47,694
Yeah.

181
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,957
Well boys, let the lady do her handy work.

182
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,790
What do you say, get out of here.

183
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:54,586
Oh,

184
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,601
Frank.

185
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:58,364
One week.

186
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:00,651
Capiche.

187
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,014
Ready?

188
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,070
As I'll ever be.

189
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,381
Ah, now, now, careful,

190
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:24,949
you know, I'm still kinda hurt.

191
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:40,403
Private nurses,

192
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:42,362
You gotta love'em.

193
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:48,690
(inmates mumble

194
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:14,654
Hey ladies.

195
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:21,793
Girl, you go girl.

196
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:30,170
Hey, baby.

197
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:31,286
Hey, girl.

198
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:47,865
I brought you girls a new chew toy.

199
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:51,705
Sure hope you make friends easy.

200
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:52,938
Hey, I know you.

201
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,021
I saw you on TV.

202
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,112
McCormick, right?

203
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:57,750
Yeah.

204
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,273
I'm Josie.

205
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:00,523
That's Spider.

206
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,283
That's my bunk.

207
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,317
That's my bunk, too.

208
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,501
Then you must have a very big ass.

209
00:16:31,335 --> 00:16:32,957
Smart mouth bitch.

210
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,910
Hit her.

211
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:06,747
Yeah.

212
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,830
Get her.

213
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:25,546
Now, that's your bunk.

214
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,356
What the hell is this?

215
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,918
You haven't been in here five minutes.

216
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,774
Just making new friends, chief.

217
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,623
Who started it?

218
00:17:41,706 --> 00:17:42,706
She did.

219
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:45,555
Can it, I'm talking to Williams.

220
00:17:47,057 --> 00:17:48,846
Just like she said, boss.

221
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,864
Uh-huh, alright.

222
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:54,660
You only get one hot
shot and this one's it.

223
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:55,743
Go get her.

224
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:01,817
Come on sister, let's
get you looked after.

225
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:05,490
What hit me?

226
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:13,803
Is this okay?

227
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,039
Hey, Terminator, you
put'em where you want.

228
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:19,605
Thanks for helping me
out with Broom-Hilda.

229
00:18:19,688 --> 00:18:20,872
No problem.

230
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:23,249
That was some pretty nasty stuff.

231
00:18:23,332 --> 00:18:24,966
Was it like judo?

232
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,185
A little of this, a little of that.

233
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:29,744
So did you like take
a class, or something?

234
00:18:29,827 --> 00:18:30,774
My dad was in the service.

235
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,894
He taught me a few things.

236
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:33,823
Cool.

237
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:37,195
So will you teach me some of it?

238
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:38,278
Yeah.

239
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,256
Sharrisse,

240
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:08,599
you're looking good.

241
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:09,682
Mr. Ryker.

242
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,410
Gotten any letters from home lately?

243
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:18,831
Sure, mom's in the
hospital, another stroke.

244
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:22,062
She's paralyzed down the left side.

245
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,145
Ah damn, that's rough.

246
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:26,857
Who's paying the bills?

247
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,278
Government mainly.

248
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:29,456
She's probably gonna
have to sell the house

249
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,920
to pay the rest of'em off.

250
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,933
What about your little girls?

251
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:35,025
Staying with Aunt Ruth.

252
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,997
She's not so good with kids, you know?

253
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,100
Yeah, neither am I.

254
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:40,160
I'll look in on'em.

255
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:41,317
Make sure they get food on the table

256
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,994
and clothes on their back, okay?

257
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,955
You don't have to do that.

258
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,121
Yeah, I do.

259
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:50,200
You came in here instead of turning

260
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:52,455
state's evidence against us.

261
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,093
We never forget a favor.

262
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:55,850
Consider it done.

263
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,933
Thanks.

264
00:19:57,957 --> 00:19:59,028
You didn't come all the way out here

265
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,281
to talk about my family.

266
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:03,531
Get right to point, huh?

267
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:10,140
What's new in your neighborhood?

268
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:11,282
Ah,

269
00:20:11,365 --> 00:20:12,865
the shooter bitch.

270
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:18,460
You want her to have a little
visit from the welcome wagon?

271
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:20,332
Okay.

272
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,243
My pleasure.

273
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:26,971
Thanks, I'll give
the kids a kiss for ya.

274
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:01,413
You girls having a good
time playing with yourselves?

275
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:02,888
Not as much fun as
you'll be having later

276
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,536
with Mr. Billy Club, I'll bet.

277
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:07,952
Lights out in three minutes, wise ass.

278
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:16,159
You wanna stop?

279
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,909
Nah, let's finish
this hand, I feel lucky.

280
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:30,916
Lock it up.

281
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,832
- Goodnight.
- Shut up.

282
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:41,669
What are you in for?

283
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:43,252
You hurt somebody?

284
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:46,062
Yeah, kinda.

285
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:48,628
I killed a guy.

286
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:51,449
My husband.

287
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,104
You?

288
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:58,492
This one night he came home drunk.

289
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,633
Just like every other night that week.

290
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:03,149
He had knocked me around a couple of times

291
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:04,649
the night before.

292
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:09,096
But this night he took off his belt.

293
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,144
No.

294
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:13,748
There was blood everywhere.

295
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:14,831
Mine.

296
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:22,622
Got me across the head a
couple times with the buckle.

297
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:25,739
And then he started to rip my clothes off.

298
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:29,655
He didn't even care that
they were all bloody.

299
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:35,284
Before I knew it, we were in the bedroom.

300
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:38,669
He started to take his pants off,

301
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:42,085
and I reached over and grabbed his .357.

302
00:22:44,246 --> 00:22:48,072
He looked at me like I was
pointing a butter knife at him.

303
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:50,905
Then he called me a stupid bitch.

304
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,577
So I shot his dick off.

305
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:57,765
You don't mess around, do you?

306
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:00,980
Hey, when I said until death to us part,

307
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,221
I meant his part.

308
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,002
That's lights out.

309
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,085
Okay.

310
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,533
Hey,

311
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:13,616
gin.

312
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:18,719
I think I've been hustled.

313
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,722
Night, Tara.

314
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:35,096
Night, Jessie.

315
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,978
Thanks for listening.

316
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:39,812
Lot a girls don't like to
hear some parts of the story.

317
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,562
No problem, kiddo.

318
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,235
Night.

319
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:45,418
Night.

320
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:23,935
Hear that?

321
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,780
Those birds are really creeping me out.

322
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:28,629
I don't know why the boss keeps them.

323
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:30,795
Yeah, me neither.

324
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:38,595
Jesus.

325
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,891
Dammit Tommy, those
things are gonna kill ya.

326
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,806
Yeah, yeah, so talk to me.

327
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:59,894
We handled the little bitch in prison.

328
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:00,860
Good,

329
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:01,879
good.

330
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:02,806
We wouldn't want anybody out there

331
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:05,424
thinking they could put a bullet
in me and get away with it.

332
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:08,191
Be bad for business.

333
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,605
Although the papers, they loved it.

334
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:16,219
Alright, I got off the phone with Amele.

335
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:18,847
He wants that shipment
of stingers a week early.

336
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,798
So make sure you get'em all
gift wrapped real pretty, huh?

337
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:25,511
Tommy, Jesus, we can't make, you know,

338
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:26,594
the delivery that soon.

339
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:28,209
I mean we barely got
rid of the Army trucks

340
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:31,419
we hijacked them off of, look at that.

341
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:34,607
You think I fell off of one
of those trucks myself, Ryker?

342
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,106
I mean get this shit outta here.

343
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:39,094
Well, the reason we're doing this

344
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:42,094
is because he's paying us $75 grand

345
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,410
for the rush shipment.

346
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:47,998
See time is money,
and he respects that.

347
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,666
Dammit, I don't know, Tommy.

348
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:53,193
He seems to be in too much of
a rush, you know what I mean?

349
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:57,491
Well, why don't you
take a couple of boys,

350
00:25:57,574 --> 00:26:01,157
bring a few undeclared
favors to the party.

351
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,455
You see anything that
even looks like a badge,

352
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:06,172
you put a rocket in his pocket.

353
00:26:06,255 --> 00:26:07,617
Smart bomb, huh?

354
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,956
Uh-huh.

355
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,998
Now, get outta here.

356
00:26:11,081 --> 00:26:12,639
Before I start liking ya.

357
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:20,956
Yeah.

358
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,203
Hey, fight.

359
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:27,700
Oh, yeah, woo!

360
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,560
Yeah, get her.

361
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:33,881
Everybody, fight.

362
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:08,126
Come on, blondie.

363
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:12,104
See what you're made, huh?

364
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:23,652
You like that, huh?

365
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,902
You like that?

366
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,150
Come on, bitch.

367
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:31,997
Come on, bitch.

368
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:48,678
Are you okay?

369
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,000
Yeah, are you?

370
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,459
Yeah, I'll be fine.

371
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:02,603
Either one of you
moves, you both get shot.

372
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:03,943
Control, Russell here.

373
00:29:04,026 --> 00:29:08,335
We need emergency med team
Block D, Cell 106, staff.

374
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:10,659
Is this the way your
people watch over us?

375
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:12,787
Nobody on my team is on the take.

376
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,259
So shut up.

377
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:16,405
Then how do you explain this.

378
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,506
Stuff a cork in it, girlie.

379
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,804
Not here even a day and you damn near kill

380
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:23,635
the most popular girls on the cellblock.

381
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:26,084
I guess we better get you
measured for a rubber sack

382
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:27,736
while we still got a chance.

383
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:28,819
Let's go.

384
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:45,032
Five minutes, McCormick.

385
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:48,365
And you're damn lucky to get that much.

386
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,788
Are you here for a reason
or just to play cute?

387
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:59,647
I don't know, maybe both.

388
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,425
Um, I'm here to offer you that same deal

389
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,605
that you walked out of before.

390
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:05,688
Deal.

391
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:08,265
Well, that was a lot easier

392
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,285
than I thought it was gonna be.

393
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:13,535
I want the same deal for
cellmate, Josie Williams.

394
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:17,167
Full pardon and relocation for both of us.

395
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,543
I'm sorry, I'm not authorized
to make that kind of deal.

396
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:22,242
Then find somebody who is.

397
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,094
Otherwise it's not going down.

398
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:26,906
Okay, I think I can work it out.

399
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:28,883
Meanwhile, I want you
to go back to your cell,

400
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:30,184
get yourself ready to travel,

401
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:32,738
and be discreet, and I'll
get the necessary paperwork

402
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:37,054
to get this ah, Josie Williams,
put into a protected cell

403
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:38,666
until you get the job done.

404
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:40,809
And I'm just supposed to trust you?

405
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:45,059
Of course, I work for
government, why wouldn't you?

406
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:48,993
Look, go back to your cell,
get your suitcases packed.

407
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:50,291
Okay?

408
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:54,920
You my dear, just had the
shortest sentence on record.

409
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:59,170
McCormick,
I'll see you on the outside.

410
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:18,838
Yo, O'Keefe here.

411
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,743
I gotta status report on McCormick.

412
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:21,766
Yeah, well, we got her.

413
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:22,890
Oh yeah.

414
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:25,380
No, well, there's just one little glitch.

415
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:26,987
She demanded the same
deal for her cellmate,

416
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,285
a Josie Williams, and I okayed it.

417
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:33,477
Hey, there didn't seem to
be any other way to get her.

418
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,005
Yeah, look we need her a whole lot more

419
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:39,005
than she needs us and she knows it.

420
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:49,748
By the way, that con you
nearly killed last night

421
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:52,657
is gonna live, not that you care.

422
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
Nice call.

423
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,523
I need to talk to you.

424
00:32:07,606 --> 00:32:08,463
What's going on?

425
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:11,497
In a little while, you're
going to get moved out of here.

426
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,009
My guess is they'll stick you in solitary.

427
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:15,337
Solitary?

428
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Shh,

429
00:32:17,688 --> 00:32:18,771
keep it down.

430
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:22,893
Look,

431
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:25,619
a guy came to talk to me.

432
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:29,056
It's the second time since my conviction.

433
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:32,614
He offered me a full pardon
if I agreed to help him.

434
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:35,693
What, like testify against
somebody or something?

435
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:38,109
Yeah, something like that.

436
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:44,499
They're gonna move you to
a safe, protected cell.

437
00:32:44,582 --> 00:32:48,749
After I've done my part,
you come out a free woman.

438
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:51,931
You did that for me?

439
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:53,827
Why?

440
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:08,396
Let's just say you remind me of someone.

441
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,785
I don't know what to say.

442
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,618
Don't say anything.

443
00:33:13,697 --> 00:33:17,530
Just act cool when the
time comes, keep quiet.

444
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:19,595
You got it.

445
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,056
So who was this guy with anyways,

446
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:22,999
the government or something?

447
00:33:23,082 --> 00:33:26,249
Yeah, your tax dollars hard at work.

448
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:36,703
Be careful, Tara.

449
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:37,985
Yeah.

450
00:34:22,596 --> 00:34:25,446
Farino,
where the hell's Tommy?

451
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:26,885
He's upstairs.

452
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:29,655
You wanna be back on the
east side runnin' numbers?

453
00:34:29,738 --> 00:34:31,571
Let's get it together.

454
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,913
Alan, get the hell outta here.

455
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:41,770
What's with him?

456
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:44,377
Ah, he's got a bug up his ass.

457
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,793
See you later.

458
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:07,481
It is going to be a...

459
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:12,443
What?

460
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:14,235
Ryker.

461
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:15,378
What you want?

462
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,758
I need to talk to you.

463
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:17,841
Oh, What, now?

464
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,861
No, next week.

465
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:20,768
Of course now.

466
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:25,056
How am supposed to get
any work done around here?

467
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,863
Alright, alright, come
on, come on, come on in.

468
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,082
Nap time, why don't you got take one,

469
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:34,430
and I'll only talk to this
man for a little bit, alright?

470
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:49,038
This better be good.

471
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:50,353
According to our information,

472
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:53,630
McCormick was transferred out
of Diablo around noon today.

473
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,675
Where'd she go?

474
00:35:57,758 --> 00:35:59,162
Nobody knows.

475
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:01,071
They were moving her to Terminal Island,

476
00:36:01,154 --> 00:36:03,222
but the bus never arrived.

477
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:06,516
I wanted that broad whacked,
didn't I tell you that?

478
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,244
Huh? And you were supposed
to take care of her, Ryker.

479
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:10,446
What am I supposed to do, get up,

480
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:13,623
go out and get a gun and
get the broad myself, huh?

481
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:16,256
Look, take it easy, Tommy.

482
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:19,192
Okay, my people told me
that, uh, she had her friend,

483
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,775
here name was, ah,

484
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,728
Williams,

485
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:25,573
got moved to solitary right
after McCormick got on the bus.

486
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,656
She's under heavy guard.

487
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,505
I'm getting the picture.

488
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:34,805
Yeah, Feds, I think
they made a deal with her,

489
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:38,907
and I think McCormick's
little bitch was part of it.

490
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,558
What's the bottom line here, Ryker?

491
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:41,843
Don't worry, whatever
they're cooking up,

492
00:36:41,926 --> 00:36:45,178
McCormick won't be too quick to cooperate

493
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:47,921
if we've got her little bedmate,

494
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:49,757
and the guard's on our payroll.

495
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,285
Do it.

496
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:56,031
But meanwhile, you find
that broad, you understand?

497
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,004
We know every flea-bitten safe
house they got in this town.

498
00:36:59,087 --> 00:37:00,875
So you get her, you break her in half

499
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,396
and you bring me the pieces.

500
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:04,454
Which pieces you want, Tommy?

501
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:05,916
The top or the bottom.

502
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:06,999
Do it!

503
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:11,521
I'll need some of the boys.

504
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,604
Fine.

505
00:37:13,456 --> 00:37:15,539
Take as many as you want.

506
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:20,606
Oh, and Ryker, don't upset me again.

507
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:24,439
I'm not a well man.

508
00:37:58,097 --> 00:37:59,097
I know it's not the Ritz,

509
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,998
but it is the most secure and discreet

510
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,176
safe house on the West Coast.

511
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:04,926
I can hardly wait.

512
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:14,984
Uh, this is it.

513
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:18,857
What a palace.

514
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,067
Miss Prince, you are looking delectable.

515
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,650
Can it, O'Keefe.

516
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:28,934
Ladies first.

517
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:36,173
Alright.

518
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:38,646
Okay.

519
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:39,661
My turn.

520
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,374
Ooh, careful there.

521
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,413
May I?

522
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:49,095
Of course you may.

523
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:57,499
Ouch.

524
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:59,148
Was that as good for you as it was for me?

525
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:00,981
Ah, better for you.

526
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:05,223
You know, a lot of people tell me that.

527
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:08,518
Anyways see, under the house,
well we have a workout room,

528
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:13,114
a sparring setup, and a fully
soundproof small arms range.

529
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,632
Yeah, sure.

530
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:16,545
No really, we do.

531
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:19,479
Alright, let's get you
all set up here, okay?

532
00:39:19,562 --> 00:39:21,812
Come on, time is our enemy.

533
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,649
It doesn't look like much.

534
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:44,060
Farino, you schmuck, it's
a damn company safe house.

535
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:45,983
Underneath that Betty Crocker exterior,

536
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:48,448
you can expect to find
three inch armor plate,

537
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,252
Armalite bullet proof glass,

538
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:52,161
not to mention enough gun
ports to give you a good look

539
00:39:52,244 --> 00:39:53,972
at that linguine you had for lunch.

540
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:55,722
Hey, DeLuca, don't touch me there.

541
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,458
Hey, sorry man, I won't do it again.

542
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,611
So, what do we do now?

543
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:02,298
Well, we got people
watching all the safe houses.

544
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:03,592
But she might not even be in there,

545
00:40:03,675 --> 00:40:05,942
this could be a waste of time.

546
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:08,666
Well, I guess we'll have to wait.

547
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,243
See what you got.

548
00:40:43,283 --> 00:40:44,101
You know, McCormick,

549
00:40:44,116 --> 00:40:47,866
Helen Keller could have
seen that one coming.

550
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:03,336
Feel better?

551
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:04,351
No.

552
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:07,577
Come on.

553
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:17,065
Now I'm happy.

554
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:22,020
Okay, playtime is over.

555
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,035
Do it again.

556
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,801
O'Keefe,
time for your briefing.

557
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,710
Time to go, thanks, Chief.

558
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:42,381
Okay, this is Tommy
Stompanato's California mansion.

559
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:43,728
He maintains two other residences

560
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:44,679
here in the United States,

561
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:45,807
there's one in Miami Beach, Florida,

562
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,147
and one in Aspen, Colorado,

563
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,361
but this is his primary residence

564
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:51,741
Our intelligence places him
here as of yesterday evening,

565
00:41:51,824 --> 00:41:53,557
so we know he's still there.

566
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,820
Now, he lives in a
private, gated community

567
00:41:55,903 --> 00:41:57,621
which has it's own private security force.

568
00:41:57,704 --> 00:41:58,960
You are under no circumstance to harm

569
00:41:59,043 --> 00:42:00,613
anyone within that patrol
group, it that understood?

570
00:42:00,696 --> 00:42:02,187
I'm not in grade school, O'Keefe.

571
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,075
I used to do this for a living, remember?

572
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,769
I'm just covering all my bases.

573
00:42:05,852 --> 00:42:06,828
May I continue?

574
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:08,498
The perimeter around his house

575
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:13,271
is controlled by a three-man,
roving team, alright?

576
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:14,272
Now they have eight hour shifts

577
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:16,449
so that gives us approximately 10 men

578
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:19,032
on site at any one given time.

579
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:22,069
Wow, that's a lot.

580
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,037
Now once you're inside that perimeter,

581
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,320
you're gonna encounter
electronic security measures,

582
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:31,394
ah, such as pressure pads, motion sensors,

583
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:33,167
and electronic I-beams.

584
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,549
Now you're gonna wanna find a control box,

585
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:35,450
- so you can reroute...
- I'm gonna need to

586
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,222
reroute circuits to computer pathways

587
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,314
to disable them.

588
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:40,224
Since they're probably
on a dual fail safe,

589
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,603
meaning they're triggered
by an interruption

590
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:43,106
of their power source,

591
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:44,890
I'll need to take a small battery along

592
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:48,265
and hard-wire it in prior
to the rerouting process.

593
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:49,348
Very good.

594
00:42:50,374 --> 00:42:51,374
Thank you.

595
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:00,149
I knew you were the
right person for the job.

596
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:01,535
I just didn't realize how right.

597
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:03,384
What kind of weapons do you have?

598
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:04,523
Oh,

599
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,338
we got the usual assortment

600
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:08,870
of rifles, pistols, shot
guns, submachine guns,

601
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,844
whatever you want.

602
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:11,824
Okay, this looks feasible.

603
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:13,696
Why don't you get me a pencil and paper.

604
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:15,156
For what?

605
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:18,077
I'm gonna make you a shopping list.

606
00:43:23,013 --> 00:43:25,513
Hey, Steve, you got a light?

607
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,662
So how's it going?

608
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:29,897
Ah, it's real quiet tonight.

609
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,903
You know, real quiet.

610
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:33,257
You heard anything yet?

611
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,986
No, nothing yet.

612
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:36,550
If I don't hear from them
in a couple of hours,

613
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:39,974
I'm gonna check it out personally.

614
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:42,653
Stay awake.

615
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,279
Ryker.

616
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:54,547
I trust you have good news for me.

617
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,630
Yeah, Tommy, I wanted to bring you

618
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,815
up to speed on a couple of things.

619
00:43:58,898 --> 00:44:01,876
That armed shipment for, um...

620
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:02,959
Amele.

621
00:44:03,011 --> 00:44:04,011
Amele, yeah, it's ready.

622
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:05,906
All we gotta do is wait for confirmation,

623
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:06,989
that he's transferred the money

624
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,763
into our Cayman Island account.

625
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:09,846
Alright.

626
00:44:11,336 --> 00:44:12,586
Tara McCormick.

627
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,599
No sign of her yet, but I
got the boys working on it.

628
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:18,742
Shit.

629
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:21,938
Alright, $20 grand to
the guy who nails her.

630
00:44:22,021 --> 00:44:24,438
I'll pass the word.

631
00:44:25,982 --> 00:44:28,356
That is unless, I get
a hold of her first.

632
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,607
In that case, well, I'm
gonna take my own...

633
00:44:36,445 --> 00:44:38,112
sweet time about it.

634
00:44:41,266 --> 00:44:42,266
Sweet time.

635
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:47,670
I understand you're bringing
me a house tonight, huh?

636
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:49,753
I believe I am, Tommy.

637
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,755
Now, I'm gonna take care of it personally.

638
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,088
Ah, you be sure and wake me, alright?

639
00:44:58,122 --> 00:45:00,161
Cause I don't wanna miss this one.

640
00:45:09,258 --> 00:45:10,180
Quarter Master is pretty impressed

641
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:11,963
with your shopping list.

642
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:13,525
Gotta bring the right tools for the job,

643
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:14,941
ask any plumber.

644
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:32,306
That's not bad.

645
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:34,391
Lousy, my grouping sucks.

646
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:36,573
If you get hungry, we got some

647
00:45:36,588 --> 00:45:38,857
Chinese food coming a little bit later.

648
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,962
This is a government safe house

649
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:42,410
and all you can afford is takeout?

650
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:44,173
Can you say the word, budget?

651
00:45:44,256 --> 00:45:47,286
Can you say the words, stir crazy?

652
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,739
Come on, let me out, just once.

653
00:45:49,822 --> 00:45:51,138
No can do, McCormick.

654
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:53,911
The agency would have my ass.

655
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:09,455
Come on, O'Keefe.

656
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:10,632
Between county jail, the pen,

657
00:46:10,715 --> 00:46:13,745
and this damn place, I'm going nuts.

658
00:46:13,828 --> 00:46:15,356
Just one night.

659
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,355
No way, not without an escort.

660
00:46:17,438 --> 00:46:19,779
Well then escort me.

661
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,518
What if Stompanato's men see us?

662
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,533
I'm sure if we stay away
from Italian restaurants,

663
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:24,783
we'll be fine.

664
00:46:26,258 --> 00:46:30,155
Okay, but we have to smuggle you out.

665
00:46:30,238 --> 00:46:32,738
Okay, let's go, I'm starved.

666
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,810
Trunk time.

667
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:48,641
Does she have to go with us?

668
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:50,765
Of course she does, she's our driver.

669
00:46:50,848 --> 00:46:52,595
What, do we need a chaperone?

670
00:46:52,678 --> 00:46:54,041
It's one of the rules.

671
00:46:54,124 --> 00:46:57,081
Field agents always have backup.

672
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:59,164
Oh, I feel much safer.

673
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:04,013
Hey, you've never seen
Miss Prince in action.

674
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:06,429
Alrighty, watch your head.

675
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:09,271
There ya go.

676
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:10,286
Comfy?

677
00:47:10,346 --> 00:47:11,346
Yeah.

678
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:13,916
I'm going to send you
guys my dry cleaning bill.

679
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:17,511
Does she ever shut up?

680
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:18,594
I don't think so.

681
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:29,419
Hey, look at that.

682
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
That her?

683
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,762
No, it's just a couple of badges.

684
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:39,776
Well, maybe we should follow them.

685
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:41,901
Hey, maybe we should
just do what the boss said.

686
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,184
Just lay low and wait 'til she comes out.

687
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:46,350
What do you say, goombah?

688
00:47:54,857 --> 00:47:59,024
Damn girlfriend, you
can't even win if you cheat.

689
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:09,347
What's up?

690
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,286
You scream and you're dead.

691
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,619
You understand?

692
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:28,032
Now we're gonna walk out
of here nice and easy like.

693
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:31,123
If you do anything to attract attention,

694
00:48:31,206 --> 00:48:32,820
I'm gonna put you on
death row permanently.

695
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:39,044
Now we're gonna be a nice,
little bitch, aren't we?

696
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:01,361
The van's waiting outside.

697
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:05,170
That's good, are you girls ready?

698
00:49:05,253 --> 00:49:07,626
Yeah, you got our money.

699
00:49:07,709 --> 00:49:08,754
No.

700
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:21,618
It's a jailbreak darling.

701
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:25,868
Those stupid prison guards,
they always get killed.

702
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:37,406
So where the hell are
you taking me, you bastard?

703
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:39,157
This is what I call the good news,

704
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,480
bad news part of the game.

705
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,234
The good news is you're out of the joint.

706
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:46,900
The bad news is you're with me.

707
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:52,639
Life's a bitch, ain't it bitch.

708
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:33,990
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

709
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:37,438
Go on, I don't wanna hear it

710
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:39,117
Let me show you how
it's done, okay Chief?

711
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Go on.

712
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,111
Here ya go.

713
00:50:49,194 --> 00:50:50,194
Thanks.

714
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,280
So how long have you
been with the company?

715
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:01,156
Since just before the
Berlin Wall came down.

716
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:02,848
Were you there when it happened?

717
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:05,722
No, I missed the big party.

718
00:51:05,805 --> 00:51:07,603
I was damn near permanently late.

719
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:09,093
What happened?

720
00:51:09,176 --> 00:51:10,942
Well, my team was sent in

721
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:15,220
to extract this Czechoslovakian
nuclear scientist,

722
00:51:15,303 --> 00:51:16,549
and in the middle of the operation,

723
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:18,454
the bean counters back in Washington

724
00:51:18,537 --> 00:51:20,604
decided to pull the
plug on the whole thing.

725
00:51:20,687 --> 00:51:23,778
So we had to body slam our
way back to the border.

726
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:25,340
Yeah, out of a team of 12 men,

727
00:51:25,423 --> 00:51:26,948
only two of us survived.

728
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:28,480
Just my C.O. and myself.

729
00:51:28,563 --> 00:51:31,555
My dad experience a
similar situation in Panama.

730
00:51:31,638 --> 00:51:32,638
Yeah, who's your dad?

731
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:35,083
He was the C.O. of Seal Team Seven.

732
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,298
McCormick,

733
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:38,659
now your dad wasn't ole
Blackjack McCormick, was he?

734
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:39,742
Did you know him?

735
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:41,173
Well, only by reputation.

736
00:51:41,256 --> 00:51:43,671
Hell, he was one of the
original Peck's bad boys.

737
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:44,837
That's him.

738
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:48,463
Our administration had been
using Noriega's resources

739
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:50,089
to fight the communists.

740
00:51:50,172 --> 00:51:52,605
After the general had
outlived his usefulness,

741
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:55,593
my dad took in a Seal
Team Seven to bring him in

742
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:56,794
one way or the other.

743
00:51:56,877 --> 00:51:58,489
Nobody's quite sure what happened,

744
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:01,322
but they weren't as lucky as you.

745
00:52:02,525 --> 00:52:04,442
They all got wiped out.

746
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,037
Pay up.

747
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:18,249
That's gotta sting, Bubba.

748
00:52:18,332 --> 00:52:19,437
You're next.

749
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,853
Good, I can use the money.

750
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:25,907
Well, getting a little late here,

751
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,467
we should get outta here.

752
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:28,550
Okay.

753
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:35,830
That was good, huh?

754
00:52:35,913 --> 00:52:38,540
Bitch cost me $20 bucks in my pool game.

755
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:41,868
I think $40 outta cover it.

756
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:42,894
It'll take a whole lot more than $40

757
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,324
to cover you there, junior.

758
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:47,410
Hey, cash machine's this way.

759
00:53:42,856 --> 00:53:47,256
Didn't anybody ever teach you
people proper table manners?

760
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,672
McCormick, O'Keefe, outside.

761
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:56,374
Now don't anybody move.

762
00:53:56,457 --> 00:53:59,924
This guy spilled my beer.

763
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:01,214
Alright, show's over.

764
00:54:01,297 --> 00:54:03,297
Who wants another drink?

765
00:54:09,534 --> 00:54:10,921
It's midnight, all is clear.

766
00:54:11,004 --> 00:54:13,630
Just wish my shift was
over, I'm getting tired.

767
00:54:58,781 --> 00:55:00,000
Hello, pretty face.

768
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,083
Bite me.

769
00:55:02,724 --> 00:55:07,198
You know,
a lady shouldn't spit.

770
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:13,002
I know you.

771
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:16,211
Everybody knows me.

772
00:55:16,294 --> 00:55:18,586
Big question is are you gonna
tell me what I wanna know?

773
00:55:18,669 --> 00:55:20,774
Well, what do you wanna know, dirt bag?

774
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:23,057
Must be tough
to get a good education

775
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,642
when you grew up in prison, huh?

776
00:55:24,725 --> 00:55:26,944
Go to hell, you stupid guinea.

777
00:55:32,483 --> 00:55:35,705
Look, I know that you and
this Tara chick made a deal

778
00:55:35,788 --> 00:55:39,738
with somebody and I wanna know who it was.

779
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:40,821
Tommy,

780
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:42,766
Tommy.

781
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:45,900
No, no, honey, it's
alright, it's alright,

782
00:55:45,983 --> 00:55:47,118
just come on, come on in.

783
00:55:47,201 --> 00:55:48,340
Oh, like hell I am.

784
00:55:48,423 --> 00:55:49,707
Ryker.

785
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:00,292
Now you see?

786
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:04,542
That can happen to you just
like that.

787
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:13,322
Now I wanna know, what is
this bitch Tara planning?

788
00:56:15,147 --> 00:56:16,561
Okay, I'll tell you.

789
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:17,704
Good.

790
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:18,949
She said she's gonna hunt you down

791
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:20,872
and stick a red hot poker up your ass,

792
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:22,372
you sick bastard.

793
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,042
See that wasn't so hard, was it?

794
00:56:31,814 --> 00:56:32,814
Gentlemen,

795
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:38,130
I think I, ah,
feel a song coming on.

796
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:04,278
This is fun.

797
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:28,291
I'm telling you man, that stuff's gonna

798
00:57:28,374 --> 00:57:30,777
twist up your veins
tighter than a nun's BVD's.

799
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,490
Hey, lay off, wise ass.

800
00:57:32,573 --> 00:57:33,617
I'm just trying to help you.

801
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,636
Well, if you wanna help then shut up.

802
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,140
I've been up all night, I gotta eat.

803
00:57:37,223 --> 00:57:39,104
Well hurry up and eat
then, I wanna get some sleep.

804
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:41,289
Now we got something in common.

805
00:57:41,372 --> 00:57:42,903
She might not even be in there.

806
00:57:42,986 --> 00:57:44,903
If I whacked Tommy Stompanato,

807
00:57:44,986 --> 00:57:47,528
I'd get a six change and move to Bolivia.

808
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:49,841
Well, you're already pretty weird.

809
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,699
Jesus, Mary, mother of God,
would you look at that?

810
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:04,259
No way.

811
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,480
Let's get her, man.

812
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,560
There she is, man, let's get her.

813
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:24,780
There's one dead chick.

814
00:58:27,663 --> 00:58:28,663
Hey, hey.

815
00:58:41,906 --> 00:58:42,906
Dammit.

816
00:58:47,452 --> 00:58:49,390
Swerve the girl off, man.

817
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,144
Ah, shit.

818
00:59:40,961 --> 00:59:42,711
She's getting away.

819
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:47,604
What the?

820
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:53,978
I can't believe you, McCormick.

821
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:54,879
What the hell is wrong with you?

822
00:59:54,894 --> 00:59:57,925
Are you deliberately trying
to get yourself killed?

823
00:59:58,008 --> 01:00:00,126
Do you have any idea
who those guys were?

824
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:03,327
Yeah, my guess would
be Stompanato's men.

825
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,602
I thought we were in the most secure

826
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,608
safe house in California.

827
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:07,691
Yeah, well you know sometimes

828
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:11,926
there's a few rats in the
in the ole cheese cupboard.

829
01:00:14,256 --> 01:00:15,777
Well, I'm not staying here.

830
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,444
Now don't worry, you won't have to.

831
01:00:17,527 --> 01:00:18,942
So what's next?

832
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:21,025
What's next is plan B.

833
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,470
Plan B?

834
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:26,746
And what's plan B?

835
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:29,164
Plan B is what comes after plan A.

836
01:00:29,247 --> 01:00:30,344
Now go upstairs and get your gear together

837
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:32,775
so we can get the hell out of here.

838
01:00:32,858 --> 01:00:33,858
Go.

839
01:00:55,329 --> 01:00:57,845
Okay, McCormick, here it is.

840
01:00:57,928 --> 01:00:59,655
You jump ship one more time,

841
01:00:59,738 --> 01:01:02,260
and I'm gonna send your ass
right back to prison, okay?

842
01:01:02,343 --> 01:01:04,130
Fine, but I think it's time you told me

843
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:05,916
why the company wants Stompanato's head

844
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,663
in a trophy case so badly.

845
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:09,300
Fair enough.

846
01:01:09,383 --> 01:01:11,391
Seems that lately,
Stompanato's gotten himself

847
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:15,097
into international arms
dealing, especially with Syria.

848
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,381
The mob is pretty patriotic.

849
01:01:17,464 --> 01:01:18,877
Hm-hm.

850
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,533
Well, Stompanato's breaking
traditions left and right.

851
01:01:22,616 --> 01:01:24,510
It seems some of his
fellow capos have decided

852
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:27,254
to put a little hit out on him.

853
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:28,611
Be nice if they could
take the heat for this

854
01:01:28,694 --> 01:01:30,162
little party of ours.

855
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:36,062
Be a minute.

856
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:39,774
Yeah, it's O'Keefe.

857
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:41,139
Yeah, I know.

858
01:01:41,222 --> 01:01:44,916
No, two of Stompanato's
men made the safe house.

859
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:46,297
Yeah.

860
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,380
What?

861
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:49,814
Oh, when?

862
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:54,742
Ah, son, why am I always the last to know?

863
01:01:54,825 --> 01:01:56,322
No, no, you take care of it.

864
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:57,405
Yeah, now.

865
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:00,652
Great.

866
01:02:00,735 --> 01:02:01,985
Who was that?

867
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,822
It's my prison contact.

868
01:02:04,905 --> 01:02:07,571
Your cellmate, she got snaked
out of her cell last night.

869
01:02:07,654 --> 01:02:09,487
Two guards got killed.

870
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,578
Josie?

871
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:13,990
Yeah.

872
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:16,454
You can bet Stompanato caught
wind of your disappearance,

873
01:02:16,537 --> 01:02:17,537
put two and two together and figured out

874
01:02:17,617 --> 01:02:18,621
we were behind it.

875
01:02:18,704 --> 01:02:21,733
Goddamn it, I hate it when
innocent people get involved.

876
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:23,363
I should scrub this
goddamn mission right now.

877
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:27,788
I just wish there was some
other way to handle it.

878
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:29,704
I'm going after her.

879
01:02:32,076 --> 01:02:33,076
Alright.

880
01:02:34,523 --> 01:02:36,981
We'll get some rest, and
we'll hit'em at daybreak.

881
01:02:37,064 --> 01:02:38,568
What's this we crap?

882
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:39,529
I'm your back up.

883
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:41,937
Oh, this is getting better all the time.

884
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,344
What, I'm not in grade
school there McCormick.

885
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,555
Remember, I do this for a living.

886
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:48,122
Wise ass.

887
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:50,020
You better take first sleep.

888
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:51,662
If I don't take a shower soon,

889
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:53,763
the trash collector will be after me.

890
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:54,846
Good idea.

891
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,050
Mind if I join you?

892
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:03,443
I thought you were
supposed to be sleeping?

893
01:04:03,526 --> 01:04:04,344
Well, you know, there's still water

894
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:07,356
conservation in this state.

895
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:08,439
Turn around.

896
01:06:53,796 --> 01:06:54,796
O'Keefe.

897
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:01,539
O'Keefe.

898
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:04,135
O'Keefe.

899
01:07:06,197 --> 01:07:07,493
O'Keefe!

900
01:07:27,107 --> 01:07:30,630
Get your clothes on, let's
get the hell out of here.

901
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,880
O'Keefe, you really know how
to show a girl a good time.

902
01:07:45,003 --> 01:07:46,503
What's in the bag?

903
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:49,769
Toys for Tots.

904
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:54,019
Why don't you take a look,
see what Santa brought ya.

905
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:04,430
Pretty cool stuff, huh?

906
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:07,326
Yeah, it'll do.

907
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:10,873
Yeah, I got everything
on your shopping list,

908
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:12,775
plus I threw in a few extra goodies.

909
01:08:39,132 --> 01:08:41,715
I didn't know you had a tattoo.

910
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:47,475
Ouch.

911
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:19,828
Now we got more trouble, Tommy.

912
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:24,556
What is it now?

913
01:09:24,639 --> 01:09:27,448
She wasted DeLuca and Big Apple.

914
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,447
Did you verify this?

915
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:31,697
I checked it personally.

916
01:09:33,714 --> 01:09:36,975
It's that damn broad.

917
01:09:37,058 --> 01:09:38,100
I sent the rest of the boys over

918
01:09:38,183 --> 01:09:40,605
to the safe house they were watching.

919
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:42,021
It was deserted.

920
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,292
What the hell is she up to?

921
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,124
My guess is the Feds are gonna keep her

922
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:51,582
moving around until she
can turn state's evidence.

923
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:52,665
Nah, nah,

924
01:09:53,663 --> 01:09:56,195
nah, not another trial.

925
01:09:56,278 --> 01:09:58,310
You've walked on three raps.

926
01:09:58,393 --> 01:10:01,283
Even if we don't find her and
she ends up turning evidence,

927
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:03,735
our lawyers can beat this case hands down.

928
01:10:03,818 --> 01:10:06,803
No, no, no, no, no, the law
of averages is against me now.

929
01:10:06,886 --> 01:10:08,303
I don't follow.

930
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,946
You ever read, Frank?

931
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:17,814
See this book right here?

932
01:10:18,827 --> 01:10:21,586
All the great criminal minds of history

933
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:23,167
are right in that book.

934
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:27,540
And every one of them
has two things in common,

935
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,892
they were the best in their field.

936
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,167
Yeah.

937
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,417
And they all got caught.

938
01:10:36,731 --> 01:10:40,612
It's not gonna happen to
me, Frank, you understand?

939
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:43,808
My pictures not gonna be in this book.

940
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:45,573
Cause you're gonna find her.

941
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:48,498
If you have to turn over
every rock in this town,

942
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:50,482
and kill every blonde that crawls out,

943
01:10:50,565 --> 01:10:54,146
you are going to find this
broad, do you understand me?

944
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:57,157
No bitch has ever beaten us yet, Tommy.

945
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,598
This one just takes a little more time.

946
01:10:59,681 --> 01:11:02,598
Time.

947
01:11:04,228 --> 01:11:06,478
Well, time is at a premium.

948
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,169
Bobby, you still around back?

949
01:11:47,252 --> 01:11:48,198
Yeah, what-a-ya need?

950
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:49,433
Can
you come up and relieve me?

951
01:11:49,516 --> 01:11:51,418
I gotta get some coffee.

952
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:53,116
You got it.

953
01:12:36,821 --> 01:12:39,175
Hey
Kenny, you still on the radio?

954
01:12:39,258 --> 01:12:40,076
Yep.

955
01:12:40,091 --> 01:12:40,909
You've got five minutes left

956
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:43,516
on your shift, then head back inside.

957
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:46,016
Okay, could use some sleep.

958
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:23,235
Man, will you pipe down
with that greaseball shit?

959
01:13:23,318 --> 01:13:25,265
This is America, speak
something I can understand.

960
01:13:25,348 --> 01:13:27,351
I said, I gave that chick such a smack

961
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:30,418
to the head she didn't feel
anything, she didn't flinch.

962
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:31,923
Excuse me.

963
01:13:32,006 --> 01:13:33,173
Is Tommy home?

964
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:43,982
I'll take that as a yes.

965
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:54,999
Congratulations, kid.

966
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:56,206
You made the grade.

967
01:14:56,289 --> 01:14:57,330
Shut up.

968
01:14:57,413 --> 01:14:58,917
Where's Josie?

969
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,762
Josie?

970
01:15:01,845 --> 01:15:02,845
Josie.

971
01:15:03,818 --> 01:15:05,068
Oh yeah, Josie.

972
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:09,475
Well, that's for me to
know and you to find out.

973
01:15:09,558 --> 01:15:11,475
I intend to find out.

974
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,140
Alright, I'll tell you what,

975
01:15:16,919 --> 01:15:18,586
I'll make ya a deal.

976
01:15:19,647 --> 01:15:22,447
You let me live, and I
will take you to the girl,

977
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:25,329
and you can both walk outta here.

978
01:15:25,412 --> 01:15:26,427
Now what ya say?

979
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:28,053
Fine, take me to Josie.

980
01:15:28,136 --> 01:15:29,136
Ah,

981
01:15:30,757 --> 01:15:31,757
deal?

982
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:33,924
Deal.

983
01:15:36,569 --> 01:15:38,459
Help me up, will ya?

984
01:15:41,316 --> 01:15:44,649
Jesus, you did a hell of job on me, kid.

985
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:48,035
I can't, I can't make it.

986
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:49,945
Here, give me your hand.

987
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:51,136
Get up, you piece of shit.

988
01:15:57,528 --> 01:15:58,528
Ah.

989
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:02,133
Up bitch.

990
01:16:06,544 --> 01:16:07,850
That's right.

991
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,540
Uh, uh, uh.

992
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:12,777
Get'em up.

993
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,027
Nice and high.

994
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:17,610
You know, you always
said that I was lucky.

995
01:16:17,693 --> 01:16:20,541
And as much as I would like

996
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:21,649
to just

997
01:16:21,732 --> 01:16:22,667
stick around

998
01:16:22,682 --> 01:16:23,660
and

999
01:16:23,675 --> 01:16:25,008
kill you slowly,

1000
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:30,842
I gotta go.

1001
01:16:32,849 --> 01:16:36,016
So, do you have any last words, bitch?

1002
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,237
Only two.

1003
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:43,383
Die, motherfucker.

1004
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:02,009
Tara, Tara in here.

1005
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:10,997
Oh my God.

1006
01:17:12,217 --> 01:17:13,217
Hold on.

1007
01:17:14,355 --> 01:17:16,432
There, I'm so sorry, this
never would have happened

1008
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:17,947
if it wasn't for me.

1009
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:21,030
Hey, at least I'm out of solitary.

1010
01:17:28,441 --> 01:17:29,458
Tara, look out.

1011
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:32,473
Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's me.

1012
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:35,227
Don't point that thing at me.

1013
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:36,552
Did you get all the bad guys?

1014
01:17:36,635 --> 01:17:39,974
Yeah, I think I got everybody.

1015
01:17:40,057 --> 01:17:41,140
Missed one.

1016
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:46,798
Surprise, surprise.

1017
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:50,255
All clear,

1018
01:17:50,338 --> 01:17:51,338
come on up.

1019
01:17:56,017 --> 01:17:59,100
Oh, you're a nasty lady, McCormick.

1020
01:18:00,085 --> 01:18:02,280
Too bad you're on the wrong side.

1021
01:18:02,363 --> 01:18:03,898
What the hell, O'Keefe.

1022
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:06,001
They make you a better
offer at the last minute?

1023
01:18:06,084 --> 01:18:08,491
O'Keefe and I are on the same team.

1024
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:11,016
Remember that story I
told you about Berlin?

1025
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:14,359
About my C.O. and I were
the only ones to escape?

1026
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:16,959
Well, I'd like you to
meet Captain Frank Ryker.

1027
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:21,226
My friend, mentor, and all
around partner in crime.

1028
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:23,320
Thanks for the assist.

1029
01:18:23,403 --> 01:18:25,810
You play a good game, girl

1030
01:18:25,893 --> 01:18:27,893
but you're too trusting.

1031
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:31,369
All of it, everything,

1032
01:18:31,452 --> 01:18:32,331
a set up?

1033
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:33,346
Afraid so.

1034
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,307
Well, there were a couple of glitches.

1035
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:37,840
Like you slippin' out of the safe house

1036
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:39,495
and the motel last night.

1037
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:43,002
Oh, by the way, thanks
for saving my ass on that,

1038
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,519
but all in all, went off without a hitch.

1039
01:18:45,602 --> 01:18:49,269
It's funny, how you
tried to save her life

1040
01:18:50,315 --> 01:18:53,184
but only ended up getting her killed.

1041
01:18:53,267 --> 01:18:56,654
But what the hell,
you'll both die together.

1042
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,544
Why go to so much trouble?

1043
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:00,461
Tommy Stompanato,

1044
01:19:00,544 --> 01:19:03,294
a peacock trapped in his own zoo.

1045
01:19:04,256 --> 01:19:06,075
He put his brains on
hold and tried to rule

1046
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:08,132
his kingdom the wrong way.

1047
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:09,836
Now it's my turn.

1048
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:12,296
Hey, Frank, out of all the coup d'etats

1049
01:19:12,379 --> 01:19:13,928
that we've arranged with the company,

1050
01:19:14,011 --> 01:19:15,398
this had to be the easiest, huh?

1051
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:17,090
Just like knocking over dominoes.

1052
01:19:17,173 --> 01:19:19,184
Keep a stiff upper lip, little soldier.

1053
01:19:19,267 --> 01:19:22,191
Who knows, you two might meet again,

1054
01:19:22,274 --> 01:19:23,274
in heaven.

1055
01:19:33,151 --> 01:19:36,388
Okay, both of ya, turn around.

1056
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,221
Come on, turn around.

1057
01:19:41,326 --> 01:19:43,909
It was a lot of fun, McCormick.

1058
01:19:45,508 --> 01:19:46,508
Eeny,

1059
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:48,888
meeny,

1060
01:19:48,971 --> 01:19:49,971
miny,

1061
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:52,608
Williams.

1062
01:20:11,537 --> 01:20:13,446
If he moves,

1063
01:20:13,529 --> 01:20:14,529
kill him.

1064
01:20:26,831 --> 01:20:28,703
Well, Williams,

1065
01:20:28,786 --> 01:20:32,370
Hey, I know we can work something out.

1066
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,609
You moved.

1067
01:20:54,053 --> 01:20:55,476
Soldier.

1068
01:21:02,236 --> 01:21:03,738
You know, McCormick, you should have

1069
01:21:03,821 --> 01:21:06,809
walked away when you had a chance.

1070
01:21:06,892 --> 01:21:09,678
Get married, have some kids,

1071
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:12,028
spend a little time in the kitchen.

1072
01:21:12,111 --> 01:21:14,559
Why don't you stick
your head up your ass.

1073
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,709
Now that had to hurt.

1074
01:21:49,010 --> 01:21:50,676
You don't pass out on me,

1075
01:21:50,759 --> 01:21:52,009
we're not done.

1076
01:22:04,384 --> 01:22:07,217
If you kill me, it will be murder.

1077
01:22:08,196 --> 01:22:10,946
Finally, something we agree on.

1078
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,457
You alright?

1079
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:44,450
Nothing that a case of bourbon

1080
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:48,285
and a year in intensive
care wouldn't cure.

1081
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:49,701
Can we go now?

1082
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:53,313
Who's gonna stop us?

1083
01:23:15,624 --> 01:23:18,012
Hello, is Mr. Stompanato home?

1084
01:23:18,095 --> 01:23:19,687
Yeah, he's in the house.

1085
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:21,249
Who are you?

1086
01:23:21,332 --> 01:23:23,249
I'm his trial lawyer.

1087
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:28,270
I don't think you'll be
