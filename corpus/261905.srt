545
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,499
I'm sorry.

546
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:44,129
- Lf you want to go, go.
- I don't want to go.

547
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,162
I don't understand you.
You're acting strange.

548
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:49,903

- I don't want to go home.

560
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,188
- I want to get them together.
- Who?

561
00:50:09,222 --> 00:50:12,350
- Max and Rita.
- Max and Rita? I don't think so.

562
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:15,759
Let me try. Come on.
Saunter me over there.

563
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:17,991
This isn't sauntering.
This is pulling.

564
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,796
Max, there's somebody here
who's dying to meet you.

565
00:50:22,836 --> 00:50:24,428
Rita Fishman.

566
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,332
She's single,
and she just caught my bouquet.

567
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:29,899
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

568

we've tried to find out...

569

where he's been hiding...

570
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:35,007
- Yeah?
- He's been seeing somebody.

571
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:37,915
- Why didn't you bring her?
- She was busy.

She's a rich client, right?

your lady friend.

- Electricity's out.
- How come?

I could've written you a check.

589

592
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,333
Why don't you take
that pretty bouquet...

593
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,032
and put it in some water?

594
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,703

NORA: They turned it out
when I was at work,

598

so I had to sit in the dark
when I come home.

I'm afraid of the dark.

600

Maybe I forgot to tell you
how I'm afraid of the dark.

601
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,730

and got your mother's number.

00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,225
JUDY: Now, there are many strong
forces at work in your life.

713
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,752
Yeah, I'd say so.

714
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,767
You're so intelligent and...

715
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,429
imaginative.

716
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,937
Come here.

717
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,946
JUDY: You're not satisfied
in your work.

718
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,949
You're a teacher.

719
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,055
I was.

720
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:10,119
Well, you're
going to teach again.

721
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,455
You need more faith.

722
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,767
Your life is heavily
influenced by women.

723
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,474
I see an older woman.
It's your mother.

724
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,302
She's a hard-working woman.

725
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,306
Yes.

726
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:33,816
I see Nora.

727
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,983
You're trying to make
a place for Nora.

728
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,988
I see someone else.

729
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,497
There's another woman
in the way...

730
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,768
someone on the other side.

731
00:59:53,806 --> 00:59:55,000
There's...

732
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,834
There's something wrong
with her neck.

733
00:59:58,878 --> 01:00:00,175
It's broken.

734
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,847
How did you know that?

735
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,311
What, honey?

736
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:08,684
MAX: How could you know that?

737
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,484
Know what, honey?
Don't be afraid.

738
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,016
Come on.
There's no evil here.

739
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,827
You got to have faith
in the unknown,

740
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,958
and then you'll
come to know it.

741
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,528
Honey.

742
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:38,509
NORA: Anybody here
want a drink?

743
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:40,178
JUDY: Oh, heavens, no.

744
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,687
I gave that up years ago.

745
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,349
You're not drinking
too much, are you?

746
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,550
NORA: Ha ha!

747
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,862
JUDY: I want to hear all about
your life these days.

748
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,363
NORA: My life's just fine.

749
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,888
Oh, I think
that's just wonderful.

750
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,894
How about your job?

751
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:59,200
Are you still in, what,
food preparation?

752
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,398
Yep.

753
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:06,067
And I can see how
your romantic life is going.

754
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,280
I believe the stars
are in your favor.

755
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:14,048
NORA: Judy.
JUDY: Hmm?

756
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,714
Max doesn't want to hear
about that shit.

757
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,052
MAX: That's OK.

758
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,250
See?

759
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,055
Not everybody is as negative...

760
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,927
about the influence of the stars
as you are.

761
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,590
Come on. I want to know
how you two met.

762
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:35,399
I picked him up in a bar.
How's that?

763
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,746
I was drunk,
and she was drunk,

764
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,910
and I liked her looks,

765
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,921
so I convinced her
to let me bring her home,

766
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,947
and I seduced her
on the sofa bed,

767
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:53,925
and it was magic,

768
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,292
and I keep coming back
for more.

769
01:01:59,766 --> 01:02:02,291
JUDY: That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

770
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,463
This man loves you.

771
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,624
Thanks, Max.

772
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,634
A lot going on
behind those eyes, huh?

773
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,795
I thought you were fake.

774
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,637
Well, the proof's always
in the pudding, isn't it?

775
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:43,471
Besides, nothing to be
afraid of, you know.

776
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,842
I never tell people what they'd
be better off not knowing.

777
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,175
You know, I try and stay on
the positive side.

778
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,851
I see something negative,
I just keep it to myself.

779
01:02:56,189 --> 01:03:02,185
I gave Nora a reading
when Charlie was just a baby.

780
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,194
I saw right then
how he'd end up.

781
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,826
I never told Nora, of course,

782
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:11,701
but I just had to carry
that secret all those years...

783
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,536
because I saw him, you know...

784
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,001
lying right there in that
section of the river Des Peres,

785
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,209
right where they found him
14 years later.

786
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,842
Everybody thought
it was an accident,

787
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:29,218
but he was full of whiskey,
full of drugs.

788
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,053
Maybe she thought that boy
might be her finest hour...

789
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,686
but given fate
and a son-of-a-bitch husband...

790
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:42,231
her own not believing
in herself...

791
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,064
she lost in life again.

792
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,734
I think maybe she gave up trying
anything after that...

793
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,904
maybe till you.

794
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,624
Well, bye.
I got to go.

795
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,397
I got to be in New York City
by Thursday.

796
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,766
I'm cooking a turkey
for my friends.

797
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,956
[Door opens and closes]

798
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,767
NORA: Did she go?

799
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:53,965
Yeah.

800
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,657
How come you never
told me about her?

801
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,328
Because she left me
a long time ago.

802
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,999
She loves you.

803
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,507
She wants her family.

804
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,011
I don't know
about family anymore.

805
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,190
Are you and I family?

806
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,366
Yes.

807
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,211
MAX: "Mushrooms."

808
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:15,343
Yeah, um, "asparagus,
basil, olive oil,

809
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,549
coffee, toilet paper."

810
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,351
Wait. I forgot parmesan.

811
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,519
No. I got it.

812
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,686
Where?

813
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,889
I'll be right back.
We need Reggiano.

814
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,204
Quarter pound
of Reggiano, please.

815
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,676
P. A: Produce, pick up
the line for a price check,

816
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:39,905
register two.

817
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,884
Max Baron, shame on you.

818
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,552
Where have you been?

819
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,390
We can't reach you anywhere.

820
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:59,057
I just left my millionth
Thanksgiving invitation...

821
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,224
on your machine.

822
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,893
Rachel, thank you.
How are you?

823
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:05,597
Super. Now, I want you to bring
your mystery lady, too.

824
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,573
Hi there.
How are you?

825
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:09,767
Fine.

826
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,072
I'll be right back.

827
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,445
OK.

828
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:26,523
P. A: We need a price check
on register two, please.

829
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,288
Price check on register two.

830
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:31,591
RACHEL: You never call me
anymore.

831
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,756
MAX: Remember last Thanksgiving?

832
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,823
RACHEL: I know,
but it won't be that bad.

833
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:38,428
No, I promise...
I won't let it, OK?

834
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:02,283
I'm in sort of a hurry, Rachel.

835
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,955
I'm counting on you.

836
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,793
I want to see
your beautiful new friend,

837
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:07,799
and I want you to see
my beautiful new house.

838
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,301
I'm not sure we can make it,
but I'll call you tomorrow.

839
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,462
Max.

840
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,133
CASHIER: $129.14, please.

841
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,334
What?

842
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:21,510
- How much?
- $129.14.

843
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,515
P. A: Cleanup on aisle 7 A.

844
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,014
MAX: Sorry. Here's some cheese.

845
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,323
What took you so long?

846
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,989
I ran into a woman.
I forget her name.

847
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,657
She's a big talker.

848
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:40,995
How we doing?

849
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,193
Fine.

850
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:53,837
How about a drink?

851
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,039
How about it?

852
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:00,545
It's so quiet here.

853
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,682
What do you have to pay
to live here?

854
01:09:04,723 --> 01:09:07,021
MAX: You know,
rents are high these days.

855
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,720
NORA: So what do you pay?

856
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,059
MAX: A lot.

857
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,526
Wait a minute.
We get naked with each other...

858
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,365
and touch each other
and you get inside me,

859
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,701
and you can't tell me
how much rent you pay?

860
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,036
Your landlord knows.
You're not even fucking him.

861
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,201
MAX: I pay $1,200.
So what?

862
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,074
NORA: So nothing.
That's my point.

863
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:31,379
You read all these?

864
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,044
MAX: Most of them.

865
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,382
You ever heard
of Arthur Miller?

866
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:35,887
Yeah.

867
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,718
He was real good to Marilyn.

868
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:39,883
He kept her going
when she was coming apart.

869
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:43,417
Except for him, she would have
died a lot earlier.

870
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,560
She was in real trouble,

871
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,429
trouble nobody knew
anything about.

872
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,099
She wasn't afraid of Arthur.

873
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:55,907
I think Marilyn was afraid
of everybody, don't you?

874
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,432
- Why do you say that?
- I just guess she was.

875
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,946
Why'd you cover up
the message machine?

876
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:12,613
I didn't c...

877
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,434
[Beep]

878
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,273
Hello, Max.
It's your mother.

879
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:33,778
Suddenly I was invited...

880
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:35,939
to the Horowitzes'
for Thanksgiving.

881
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:39,473
So why not to their wedding?
So are you going to take me?

882
01:10:39,518 --> 01:10:41,110
Let me know.

883
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:42,950
Where are you?

884
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:46,788
I have a funny earache.
Why aren't you home anymore?

885
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:47,951
[Beep]

886
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,621
Hello, Max Baron.
This is Corrine Miller.

887
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,632
Remember me? Creative Director
at Corwin, Hiller, and Greene?

888
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,293
Let's have breakfast sometime.

889
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,961
418-3586.

890
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,299
[Beep]

891
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:02,967
Maxie, it's Heidi Solomon,
and you don't call me back.

892
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,476
Is it true you have
a lady in your life?

893
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,978
Oh, well. Give me a call.

894
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,138
[Beep]

895
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,477
Max, it's Rachel.

896
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,483
I invited your mother
for Thanksgiving.

897
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,814
Was that so bad of me?

898
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,148
You still haven't told me...

899
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,654
if you're bringing your mystery
woman for turkey dinner...

900
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,816
I mean, unless you'd like
to bring Rita Fishman.

901
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:20,654
She'd die to come with you.

902
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,820
This is my millionth
message, Max,

903
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,329
and in case the word isn't out,
I'm pregnant.

904
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,093
Call us.

905
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:28,292
[Beep]

906
01:11:28,334 --> 01:11:31,826
NEIL: Missing pal, what goes?
You don't live there anymore?

907
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,168
Look, Rachel got crazy, invited
your mother to Thanksgiving.

908
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,538
Don't blame me.
Call me, OK?

909
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:39,074
So were you going to invite me?

910
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,010
I don't know if I want to go
to the Horowitzes' myself...

911
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,241
for Thanksgiving.

912
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:46,251
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

913
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,847
NORA: I know I'm a big secret
to your friends.

914
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,755
Well, if I go, you're going.
Are you up to it?

915
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:54,190
Screw the Horowitzes.

916
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:55,853
Truth is,
I'm working Thanksgiving.

917
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,885
You are not working
Thanksgiving.

918
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,394
We are going to go
to the Horowitzes'.

919
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,233
NORA: This is her, huh?

920
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,906
That's her.

921
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,908
Hey, Janey.

922
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,582
What do you think
we should do, huh?

923
01:12:25,124 --> 01:12:26,386
Should we go
to the Horowitzes',

924
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,586
or should we just eat
at White Palace?

925
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,889
Maybe we should have some turkey
with Heidi Heidi Ho...

926
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,056
or cranberry sauce...

927
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:35,589
with Corin, Borin,
Storin, and Fishface.

928
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,096
Do you think we should do...

929
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,753
Here's what we're going to do.

930
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:07,095
We're going to go and have
Thanksgiving dinner...

931
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,793
at the Horowitzes'.

932
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:12,433
You up to it?

933
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,870
Absolutely.

934
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,132
They're expecting another Janey.

935
01:13:18,177 --> 01:13:19,474
Janey's dead.

936
01:13:27,786 --> 01:13:30,448
I'm going to go in there.
I'm going to say,

937
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,957
"Hello. My name is Nora, and you
can all go fuck yourselves.

938
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:34,458
I'm not Janey."
How's that?

939
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,653
Perfect.

940
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:50,301
Except I think I made a big
mistake with these shoes...

941
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:51,468
and maybe my hair.

942
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,341
Nora, your hair is fine.

943
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,845
You're not going to all be
talking Jewish, are you?

944
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:05,486
I was going to make
a sweet potato pie,

945
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:08,357
but then I thought,
everybody loves noodle pudding.

946
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,794
What is that?

947
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:12,990
MAX: She's a friend of mine.
Her name is Nora.

948
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,194
You be nice, Mother, or I'll
beat the shit out of you.

949
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,994
Come on.
Nora, this is my mother Edith.

950
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,370
NORA: Nice to meet you.

951
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,002
Do you mind if I sit
in the front?

952
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,705
I get carsick
if I sit in the back.

953
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,348
No, no.

954
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,549
MAX: Sorry.
NORA: It's OK.

955
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,024
She's no spring chicken.

956
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,551
Just get in the car.

957
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,539
Come on in.

958
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:03,707
BOY: Whee!

959
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,216
Hey, no running.
No running.

960
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:06,740
BOY: Hi there, Max.

961
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,752
Honey! Rach, Max is here!

962
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,381
Rach? Honey, Max is here.

963
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:15,757
RACHEL: Oh, coming!

964
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:24,235
Hello. I'm Rachel Horowitz.

965
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:26,066
Hello, Edith.
I'm so happy you could come.

966
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,072
EDITH: I brought you
my noodle pudding.

967
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:31,234
RACHEL: Thank you, Edith.
You didn't have to do that.

968
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,743
Rachel, this is Nora Baker.

969
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,747
Welcome to our home, Nora.
Let me take your coat.

970
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:38,409
Thank you, Max.
What would you like to drink?

971
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,940
Oh, do you drink?

972
01:15:39,985 --> 01:15:42,078
Sometimes. Yeah.

973
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,247
Um, do you have
vodka and tonic?

974
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:46,086
RACHEL: We have everything.
And scotch for you, Max?

975
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:48,115
MAX: No. I'll have
a vodka and tonic, too.

976
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,422
Really? Hmm.

977
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,089
Neil, would you fix
two vodka and tonics?

978
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,427
Two vodka tonics!

979
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,933
Now, Max knows everybody,
I think.

980
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,435
Sherri? Sherri?

981
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:59,266
WOMAN: I'm right here.

982
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,272
This is Sherri Klugman.

983
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,432
Sherri, Nora Baker.

984
01:16:02,474 --> 01:16:04,271
Hello, Nora.
Lovely to meet you.

985
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,776
NORA: Thank you. Same here.

986
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,278
- Hi, Max.
- Hey, Sherri.

987
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,109
Two vodka tonics.

988
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:12,275
RACHEL: Nora, this is
Neil's father Sol Horowitz.

989
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,114
This is Nora Baker, Dad.

990
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:15,278
Hello, Max.

991
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,617
RACHEL: Sol, you know Max.

992
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,282
One of my favorites.

993
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:21,451
Uh, would you excuse me?
I have to check the kitchen.

994
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,654
I have a cranberry problem.

995
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:26,289
OK.

996
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:27,662
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

997
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,335
Go easy. We have the whole day
ahead of us.

998
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,671
You sure you're all right?

999
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,972
Stop asking me that.

1000
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,171
WOMAN: Max!

1001
01:16:40,212 --> 01:16:42,339
Darling! Oh!

1002
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:44,982
It's so good to see you.

1003
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,315
Oh, darling,
can you believe it?

1004
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,819
I'm going to be
a grandmother.

1005
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,481
I know. How about that?
How are you doing?

1006
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:55,391
Oh, well, Sol took me to Italy
for my birthday.

1007
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,192
That's how I'm doing.

1008
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,327
Oh, isn't this house terrific?

1009
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,162
Is Rachel one lucky girl?

1010
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,326
Ha ha!

1011
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:04,995
Oh, and, Noreen...

1012
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:06,163
- Nora.
- Nora!

1013
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,671
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1014
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:10,004
Little Maxie.

1015
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,670
This is Rachel's mother.
Nora Baker, Sophie Rosen.

1016
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:13,837
EDITH: Aah!

1017
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,005
[Crash]

1018
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:16,514
Oh, I'm sorry!

1019
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,516
It was an accident.
I'm sorry.

1020
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,347
I didn't mean to get it
on your carpet.

1021
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:21,852
Don't worry about it.

1022
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,184
Just relax, darling.

1023
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:25,212
It's no big deal.

1024
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,685
- Hello.
- Hi.

1025
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,524
- You're Max's lady.
- I'm with him.

1026
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:32,359
I'm Larry Klugman.

1027
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,194
Max and I went
to high school together.

1028
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:35,392
Nora Baker.

1029
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,094
Oh! Your glass is empty.

1030
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,565
What are you drinking?

1031
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,436
Vodka, straight.

1032
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,237
What do you think of our boy?

1033
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,377
Nice boy.

1034
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,379
Here we go.

1035
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,582
Vodka, straight.

1036
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:00,383
Thanks.

1037
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:03,394
Honey, can I see you
a second, please?

1038
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,055
I want to show you
the kitchen chairs.

1039
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,224
They're exactly what
we've been looking for.

1040
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:08,391
LARRY: Sure.

1041
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,559
Excuse us, please.

1042
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,398
Sure. You better get a peek
at those chairs, Lar.

1043
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:12,562
Hey, huh?

1044
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:13,730
Yeah.

1045
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,239
WOMAN: Edith,
don't worry about it.

1046
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,935
EDITH: Please. I did it.
I want to clean up.

1047
01:18:18,977 --> 01:18:20,410
Edith, you're a guest
in the house.

1048
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,413
I know, but I want
to get this spot out.

1049
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:23,914
- Just sit down.
- I did it.

1050
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,507
Just relax.

1051
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,249
EDITH: I feel so embarrassed.

1052
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:32,279
WOMAN: Lt'll come out.
Believe me, it'll come out.

1053
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,086
RACHEL: Neil!

1054
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,459
NEIL: In a minute!

1055
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,438
WOMAN: Pamela!

1056
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:48,700
SECOND WOMAN:
How are you, Doreen?

1057
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,324
MAX: Nora.

1058
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,659
MAX: Nora.

1059
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:30,314
Oh! I'm terribly sorry.
It wasn't locked.

1060
01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:31,645
No, it's all right.
I was just leaving.

1061
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:33,844
I was putting on my lipstick.

Yeah.

You work in town?

1072

Yeah, I do.

What's your work?

1074
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,009
I'm in, uh, food preparation.

1075

1076
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:05,012
That's interesting.

1078

I'm a waitress.

1079

01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,419
Where?

1081
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,526
White Palace.
It's a hamburger restaurant.

1082

SHERRl: Oh.

1083
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:22,256
What do you do?

1084
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,725
I'm a decorator.

Isn't it subtle?

1087
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:32,740
Oh, very subtle.

1088
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:39,346
So... how did you meet Max?

1089
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,786
He came in for a burger. Ha ha!

1090
01:20:43,822 --> 01:20:45,756
How romantic.

You know, he's quite a catch,
our Max.

How did you ever do it?

1093
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:58,368
I give a good blow job, I guess.

in this house,

1099

but no one is mad at you,

1100

and we don't want to judge you,
and I don't think...

1101
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:27,955
you should be so fast to judge
other people's blow jobs...

sometimes.

1203
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,179
Yeah, sometimes
I think Charlie did it...

1204
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,378
to get back
at his father and me.

1205
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,678
We weren't the best parents,

I'm sorry

1234
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:13,954
Oh, well, I like photography,

1235
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:16,789
and they have these
photographic safaris.

1236
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,023
Did you take
the pictures over there?

1237
01:30:19,063 --> 01:30:20,621
Yeah. Can you believe it?

1238
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,997
MAX: They're very good.
You should be a professional.

1239
01:30:23,034 --> 01:30:26,993
Well... well, I certainly felt
professional when I took them.

1240
01:30:27,038 --> 01:30:29,131
Can you believe that I was
this close to that hippo...

1241
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:30,470
as to that wall?

1242
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:32,237
You really should make the trip.

1243
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:39,013
So, what kind
of camera do you have?

1244
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,482
Um... Nikon.

1245
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,953
What do you use?

1246
01:30:43,988 --> 01:30:45,649
A Canon E-X,

1247
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,659
and I just bought
a little Olympus.

1248
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,183
Do you take a lot of pictures?

1249
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:54,164
I'm more into music.

1250
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:56,632
Oh. Well,
I knew that about you.

1251
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:58,658
I tried to get you
to a concert, you rat.

1252
01:30:58,703 --> 01:30:59,829
MAX: Oh. Right.

1253
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:00,997
You never called me back.

1254
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:03,666
Excuse me.
The Goodmans are here.

1255
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:04,834
We almost got lost.

1256
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:06,207
Hi. How are you?

1257
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:17,816
NEIL: Hi there.

1258
01:31:17,855 --> 01:31:19,516
RACHEL: Hi, sweetie.
MAX: Hi.

1259
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,684
NEIL: Oh, Maxie.

1260
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:25,526
So, what was Miss Solomon
telling you?

1261
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:26,860
Uh, about Africa.

1262
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,195
Uh-huh.

1263
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,359
She took the pictures
on the wall.

1264
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:31,698
Ooh.

1265
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:32,862
Talented.

1266
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,701
She's a gorgeous girl, huh?

1267
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,037
Huh? Gorgeous? Gorgeous?

1268
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:38,701
Gorgeous? Huh?

1269
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:40,040
She cooks.

1270
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:41,874
She travels.

1271
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:44,040
She's a perfect hostess.

1272
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,049
Beautiful.

1273
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:47,414
How do you know?

1274
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:49,909
- Well, just...
- What?

1275
01:31:51,088 --> 01:31:53,579
How do you know
who's right for each other?

1276
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,061
Well, you...

1277
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:00,086
I mean, the Goodmans
or the...

1278
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:03,589
or the Clarks or...

1279
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:06,395
Andie and Jasper?

1280
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:09,406
I mean, we all said
they're perfect for one another,

1281
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,771
and they didn't last a year.

1282
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:13,903
Larry and Sherri?

1283
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,073
I've never heard Larry say
a decent word about his wife.

1284
01:32:17,114 --> 01:32:20,948
Hey, hey, Max.
What are you talking about, huh?

1285
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,125
There's no dust
in her Dustbuster.

1286
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,427
What?

1287
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:40,130
There's no dust
in her Dustbuster!

1288
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,266
WOMAN: What did he say?

1289
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:45,138
Something about a Dustbuster?

1290
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,819
RACHEL: Max,
where are you going?

1291
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:03,042
[Buzz]

1292
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,014
JUDY: Yes?

1293
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,853
It's Max.

1294
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,382
JUDY: Oh, my God. Don't move.

1295
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:30,539
How are you, Judy?

1296
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:33,049
She told you not to come.

1297
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,244
Where is she?

1298
01:34:35,252 --> 01:34:39,245
I knew something was on the way,
but, oh, my God.

1299
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,425
You've given up resistance.

1300
01:34:45,129 --> 01:34:46,756
Tell me where she is.

1301
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:16,586
NORA: Here you go.

1302
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:17,753
You all finished?

1303
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:19,422
Uh, yeah.
Maybe a piece of...

1304
01:35:19,463 --> 01:35:20,589
OK, I'll bring you the menu.

1305
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,098
MAN: I'll have cheesecake,

1306
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,328
and he's going to have
a slice of chocolate cake.

1307
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,810
MAN: Lady, I'm in the middle
of ordering!

1308
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:47,954
WOMAN: Table for one, sir?

1309
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,823
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

1310
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:55,659
WOMAN: Have a nice meal.

1311
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,632
I asked you not to follow me.

1312
01:36:02,673 --> 01:36:03,970
MAX: I need to tell you
something.

1313
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,270
Go away.

1314
01:36:05,309 --> 01:36:07,641
I just want you to listen to me.

1315
01:36:07,745 --> 01:36:11,181
Nora, I've been selfish
and careless.

1316
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,643
I've been stupid.

1317
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:14,981
I don't belong in your life.

1318
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,782
You're wrong.
You do belong.

1319
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,986
I've got a new life.
I feel good about myself.

1320
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,514
I can't go back.

1321
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:28,825
You get yourself a...
a nice young girl...

1322
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:32,996
with a college education
who won't embarrass you.

1323
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,834
You're not
an embarrassment to me.

1324
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,863
I'm an embarrassment to me.

1325
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,041
NORA: I just got this job.
I don't want to lose it.

1326
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:45,512
I thought that you
didn't fit into my life,

1327
01:36:45,549 --> 01:36:47,210
but it was me who didn't fit.

1328
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:49,678
Go back to St. Louis.

1329
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,551
MAX: I don't live
in St. Louis anymore.

1330
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,850
I left St. Louis.

1331
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:56,018
I quit my job,
and I quit the city.

1332
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:00,224
I just looked at a room to rent
over at 49th and 9th Avenue.

1333
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:04,701
It has a little stove
and a little refrigerator...

1334
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:07,226
and a view of the trash cans.

1335
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,904
All I need now is a job.

1336
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:13,877
I'd like to go
back to teaching.

1337
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:20,379
Max, people just
don't change overnight.

1338
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:21,611
MAX: People discover things...

1339
01:37:21,652 --> 01:37:22,880
about themselves in life,
don't they?

1340
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,888
And they only hope
that it isn't too late.

1341
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,890
I don't want
a nice young girl.

1342
01:37:26,924 --> 01:37:28,585
I had a nice young girl.

1343
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:30,753
I want you.

1344
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:40,263
I love you, Nora.

1345
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,112
Come on, buddy.
Are you going to order or what?

1346
01:37:57,788 --> 01:37:59,278
What will you have?

1347
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,230
You got any Oak Ridge Boys?

1348
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:16,799
Honey, I got
everything you need.

1349
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:38,318
[Cheers and whistles]

1350
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,800
NORA: So how's your mother?

1351
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:52,832
[Max and Nora laughing]
