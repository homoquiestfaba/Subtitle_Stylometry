Junior prom is the sacred rite
of every human teenager.

36
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,261
As a kraken who is barely
pulling off

37
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:39,761
this whole human thing,

38
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,932
I need to be there
so that I can blend in.

39
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:44,333
And, as a proud mathlete,

40
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,202
I know that to find
a potential solution,

41
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,137
I have to evaluate the problem.

42
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,771
Now, I know the rules.

43
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:52,041
Our family is not allowed
in the ocean, ever.

44
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,209
For any reason.

45
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,609
And I love rules.

46
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,611
I do. I really, really do.

47
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,614
But the prom boat
is on the water,

48
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,217
not in the water.

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,652
"What if there's a storm?"
you might ask.

50
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,221
Well, I've analyzed
weather trend data,

51
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:07,689
and my trusty friend,
the Internet,

52
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:10,359
has assured me that it will be
smooth sailing on prom night.

53
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:14,964
And lastly, this is the captain
of said prom boat.

54
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:16,365
Look into those eyes.

55
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:18,301
Tell me he hasn't seen it all.

56
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,735
I trust him with my life,
and so should you.

57
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,206
And that is why I,
Ruby Gillman,

58
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,873
should go to prom. Thank you.

59
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:27,709
Please, please, please,
please, please!

60
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,112
Strong presentation.

61
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,913
I like the energy,
but it's still a no, honey.

62
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:33,849
But, Mom, evidence,
science, Internet.

63
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,319
Trust me, Ruby,
I know what's best for you.

64
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:38,720
And what's best
is to always stay on land.

65
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:39,721
That's why we moved here.

66
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,157
It's much safer for us.

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,992
Sorry, Tadpole, Mom's right.

68
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,860
Sam, breakfast!

69
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,396
Hey, didn't you say
that prom was a postbolognal...

70
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,398
Postcolonial
patriarchal construct. It is.

71
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:51,200
But we would go as a group.

72
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:52,401
As a form of protest.

73
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:54,437
Wow. So brave.

74
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,938
What do you think?

75
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,140
I had these printed
for my big launch party.

76
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:58,740
I think I'm in love.

77
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:01,676
-Blech. -Do you still
need me to be there?

78
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,878
Yes. This is a make-or-break
moment.

79
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,779
I'm selling
an entire development.

80
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,149
But, Mom, you're...

81
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:08,750
Agatha Gillman,
and I slay the competition.

82
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,653
She got us our dream home,
and I'm not asking how.

83
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:14,924
Well, I just want
to show potential buyers

84
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:17,193
what a happy Oceanside family
looks like.

85
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:20,296
I'll be closing my shop for
the day so I can man the grill.

86
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,365
From chill man to grill man.

87
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:24,833
Ooh, Arthur,
you should think about

88
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:26,335
hiring someone to help you.

89
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,905
Business has been booming
since you started <i>Bottled Up.</i>

90
00:04:28,938 --> 00:04:29,671
Hey there.

91
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,474
Welcome back to <i>Bottled Up.</i>

Wow, you two are quite
the power couple.

95
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:43,186
You think that's great?

96
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,421
You're looking at
the undefeated dodgeball champ.

97
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:52,061
He's a legend. Ooh.

98
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:54,463
Yeah, yeah.
You guys are all crushing it.

99
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,399
Oh, Ruby,
don't sell yourself short.

100
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:57,866
You're amazing at math.

101
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,834
I am the reason
Connor's passing algebra.

102
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:01,170
Oh, Connor.

103
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,905
-So dreamy.
-Sam.

104
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,473
Ow. You're the one
in love with him.

105
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,409
Hey, hey. Stop.
You each landed one.

106
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,743
<i>Marine Biologist Quarterly?</i>

107
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:10,947
Oh, Ruby.
You're still reading this trash?

108
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,349
Humans don't know everything
about the ocean.

109
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:14,816
Mom, there's a whole world
down there

110
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,018
that I have never seen.

111
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,954
Jellyfish, plankton,
coral reefs...

112
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,122
But what else lives there?

113
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,790
I know. Monsters.

114
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:24,160
And those monsters
want to hurt krakens like us.

115
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,996
This is where we belong.
Oceanside is our home.

116
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,099
Then help me fit in
by letting me go to prom.

117
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,268
Ruby, the answer is no.

118
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:34,836
Time to go.

119
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,272
-Mom.
-Gillman dishes to Gillman.

120
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:37,806
The fadeaway at the buzzer,

121
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,975
-and it's good!
-Yeah.

122
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:39,841
Woo-hoo!

123
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:40,977
Limb up, everyone.

124
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,079
Let's all have
a very human day.

125
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:46,015
Does it bother you guys that we
lie to everyone all the time?

126
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:49,085
Oh, we're not lying.
We're just omitting.

127
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:50,152
Yeah, okay.

128
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,520
And remember...

129
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:54,123
If anyone asks,
we're from Canada.

130
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,269
Whoa, what's happening?

131
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:08,137
-Are we supposed to be stopped?
-Is our tour over?

132
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,540
Apologies for the unplanned
interruption, folks.

133
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:14,843
Well, look what the tide
dragged in, Davey.

134
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,513
Ahoy, Mr.--
Captain Gordon Lighthouse, sir.

135
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,282
Aren't you one
of them Gillmans?

136
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:20,283
Guilty.

137
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,552
Just kidding. Not guilty.
Totally normal.

138
00:06:23,586 --> 00:06:26,555
-Is she blue?
-I'm from Canada... eh.

139
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,293
Oh...

140
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:31,527
That totally makes sense.

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,463
I've got my eye on you,
Gillman girl.

142
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,898
And my other eye, too!

143
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:41,003
Our tour begins
where 15 years ago,

144
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:44,839
I swear I saw the monstrous
giant kraken.

145
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:47,143
And to your right, Oceanside's
best saltwater taffy.

146
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:49,578
Ask for the Gordon Lighthouse
discount.

147
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,380
Hey, guys.

148
00:06:51,414 --> 00:06:53,349
-Yo. -Greetings.
-So, how did it go?

149
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:55,418
Yes. I'm dying to find out.

150
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:57,620
Same. I've been stress-gaming.

151
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,955
Well, it's official.
Mom won't let me go to prom.

152
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:01,524
And I know it's not
what we wanted,

153
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:03,926
but we still have plan B,

154
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,162
our very cool anti-prom party.

155
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,198
And what is the most
liberated food out there?

156
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,233
Guys, I'm talking fondue.

157
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,905
Ruby, um, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

158
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,540
Kayla asked me to the prom.

159
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,642
-Oh.
-And, uh,

160
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,210
I said carpe diem.

161
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,411
Aka, I said yes.

162
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,946
-What?
-I said yes.

163
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,383
No, I got that. Loud and clear.

164
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:32,388
Okay, Margot has torn our hearts

165
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,622
into a million tiny pieces,

166
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,191
and that's fine.

167
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:37,159
More fondue for the rest of us,
right, guys?

168
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:38,494
Yeah, uh,

169
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,229
once Margot was going
with Kayla,

170
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,531
Trevin said, "Oh, well,
should we just go together?"

171
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,233
And I agreed.

172
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,635
So Trevin and I are going
to the prom together.

173
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:48,137
As friends.

174
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,672
Yeah, only as friends.

175
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,307
What?

176
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,308
What?

177
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,609
Sorry, Ruby.

178
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:55,144
We promised to always
stick together.

179
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:58,247
Does squad solidarity
mean nothing to you?

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,515
Well, of course it does.

181
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:00,983
Which is why
you should come with us.

182
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:02,318
You'll be on a boat.

183
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:03,652
You'll be completely safe.

184
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:05,621
Unless there's
a tragic accident.

185
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:08,124
-Bliss, no catastrophizing.
-Sorry.

186
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:11,260
You guys know my mom,
and that is why we made plan B.

187
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,496
Margot, just bring Kayla
to our anti-prom party.

188
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,264
We will watch bad movies.

189
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:16,499
We'll dip Swiss.

190
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:17,600
Enough with the fondue!

191
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:20,369
We eat a lot of cheese.

192
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:21,670
Wheels of it.

193
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,472
Think about how many events
we've missed

194
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:25,107
in squad solidarity

195
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,576
because of your mom's
irrational anti-ocean rule.

196
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,245
I guess a few.

197
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:31,514
What? There was the field trip
to the submarine museum.

198
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,149
The school beach day.

199
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,084
-All-county surf contest.
-The Grunion Fun Run.

200
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:36,452
The Oceanside
Festival of the Bard.

201
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:38,053
My grandmother's
beach birthday party.

202
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,555
Kayla's beach birthday party!

203
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,956
Any birthday party but Bliss's.

204
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,024
You're always welcome
at the graveyard.

205
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:44,593
But this isn't just any party.

206
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,228
This is prom.

207
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,364
And I really want
to be a part of it.

208
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,399
We all do.

209
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,034
Yeah. No, I get it.

210
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,569
You guys should go without me.

211
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:55,538
It's one thing for my mom
to ruin my life.

212
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:57,039
She doesn't have to ruin yours.

213
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,408
Uh, what if you don't tell her?

214
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,010
Gasp of exclamation!

215
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:03,045
Trevin's right.
Your mom doesn't have to know.

216
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,080
Deception. I'm on board.

217
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:06,449
Come on, Ruby. Do it.

218
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:08,017
Do it.

219
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,152
I want to,
but if my mom finds out, uh...

220
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,221
Oh, life is not
a dress rehearsal.

221
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:17,460
It's time for you to go big
and go to prom.

222
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:18,594
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

223
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,763
You're right.

224
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,665
Okay, I'll do it.

225
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:25,234
-I'll go to prom.
-Yes!

226
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,304
And I'm gonna ask Connor.

227
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:29,605
Connor?

228
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,207
Okay, that's a...
that's a big swing there.

229
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,075
Whoo. But we are here for it.

230
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:36,111
Step one, you're going
to need a prom-posal.

231
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:38,113
Blue-sky with me, people.
Any ideas?

232
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,748
Maybe I can ask him with
something epic,

233
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:42,651
like an advanced
quadratic equation.

234
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,355
And when I solve it,
the answer is...

235
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:48,023
prom.

236
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:53,395
Ruby, my sweet, wide-eyed,
dumbest smart person ever,

237
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,265
you cannot ask Connor to prom
with homework.

238
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:58,601
But look how it graphs.
It's cool.

239
00:09:58,634 --> 00:09:59,802
It is not cool.

240
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,137
A good prom-posal is art.

241
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:03,506
Showmanship is the name
of the game

242
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,208
in this hormone-fueled
benchmark of adolescence.

243
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,143
A ritual that embodies
the ultimate

244
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:10,246
in high risk, high reward.

245
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,515
-Now, you get one shot at prom

246
00:10:12,548 --> 00:10:16,452
and one shot at persuading your
Romeo that you are his Juliet.

247
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:20,222
With stakes this high,
the only option is to go big.

248
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:23,125
Everyone,
don't forget to RSVP for prom,

249
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:25,794
the most important day
of your lives.

250
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:28,197
I almost asked Connor to prom
with homework.

251
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,132
We got you, Ruby.
There are so many other options.

252
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:33,102
Here, this is the first draft,
but with this script

253
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,137
and my favorite prop
from clown school...

254
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,206
Mm, I don't know. Do you have
something a little smaller?

255
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:40,109
Tone down the drama, you say?

256
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:41,410
-I know just the thing.
-What's that?

257
00:10:41,443 --> 00:10:43,445
A commercial-grade
DJ confetti cannon.

258
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,382
You just ask Connor to prom,
push this button,

259
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:49,652
and the confetti will rain down
like closing night on Broadway.

260
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,787
Uh, maybe I abandon this whole

261
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,856
"ask your dream guy
to prom" thing.

262
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:01,697
♪ I really, really wanna get
to know ya ♪

263
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,865
Connor.

264
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,867
♪ Hello, hello ♪

265
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,437
♪ I really, really wanna get
to know ya ♪

266
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,105
♪ Hello, hello... ♪

267
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,174
Connor, would you do me
the honor

268
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,310
of going to human prom with me?

269
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,312
Oh, Ruby, yes.

270
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:20,583
Oh, you've made me the happiest
guy on dry land, Ruby.

271
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:22,851
-Connor.
-Ruby.

272
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:25,287
Ruby?

273
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:27,856
Hi.

274
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,658
Connor's here.

275
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:32,595
Uh, yeah. Connor's here.

276
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,465
Oh! Oh. Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

277
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:37,866
Uh...

278
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,569
we're still on for our tutoring
sesh later, right?

279
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,837
Oh.

280
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,140
Oh, yeah, Connor.
We are on like polygons.

281
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:47,576
All right. Team math.

282
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,877
I'll see you later.

283
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:51,347
You know it.
Anything for my alge-bae.

284
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,449
-Your what now?
-I mean bro.

285
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:54,817
A-Alge-bro.

286
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,218
Like you're my brother.

287
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,620
You're my math brother.

288
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:02,324
You know, I think I liked
the first one better.

289
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,431
Give me that confetti cannon.

290
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,499
Yes!

291
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,401
You gotta practice.

292
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,370
The trick is to reject
the concept of gravity.

293
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,238
It doesn't exist.
It's not real.

294
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:17,640
All right. Peace out.

295
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,575
Yo, hit me up later.

296
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,480
-Hey, Connor.
-Hey, Ruby.

297
00:12:24,513 --> 00:12:25,581
What's up?

298
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,516
Um, hey.

299
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,419
So, I was wondering,

300
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,187
did you see, like,
all those prom-posals

301
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,622
around school this morning?

302
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,290
-Yes.
-Hmm.

303
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:36,792
They kind of weird me out.

304
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,327
Just ask someone.

305
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,896
It doesn't have to be
this big proposal.

306
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,264
It's crazy, right?

307
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:45,267
Oh, yeah, I hear that.

308
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,469
And besides,
prom is a postcolonial

309
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:49,538
-patriarchal construct.
-Patriarchal construct.

310
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,539
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

311
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:57,579
It could be fun to go
with the right person, though.

312
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,749
Oh.

313
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:02,718
Yeah. Totally.

314
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:06,455
-Ruby... Oh.
-Connor... Oh, sorry.

315
00:13:06,488 --> 00:13:08,824
-Ruby... Oh, hey.
-Connor... Oh, you go.

316
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,559
-No, you go.
-No. You go.

317
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,428
Yeah, no, you go. I go.

318
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:15,664
Wait. Okay, no. But seriously,
what-what did you want to say?

319
00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:19,301
Um, Connor, I...

320
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,203
I...

321
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:23,305
-...think I'm gonna be sick.
-Whoa.

322
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:24,807
Hey. Are-are you okay?

323
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,542
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

324
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,677
I get seasick sometimes
when I'm next to the ocean.

325
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:30,345
It's genetic.

326
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,915
You know, my sisters do this
grounding technique thing.

327
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,383
Ooh. Whoops. Wait, what's this?

328
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,318
-Hah. Oh. That?
Never seen that before. -Whoa.

329
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,721
-Is this a kaleidoscope?
-Maybe put it down.

330
00:13:38,754 --> 00:13:40,723
It's party time!

331
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:46,695
Connor!

332
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,464
Connor, are you okay?

333
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:55,337
Connor, grab this!

334
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:58,373
Son of an anglerfish!

335
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:04,847
Connor!

336
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:10,886
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

337
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,999
What just happened?

338
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:34,336
Connor.

339
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,841
-The new girl
saved Connor. -Connor?

340
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:39,909
-She's a hero.
-Connor.

341
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,376
Ruby, there you are.

342
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,711
You missed the story
of the year, girl.

343
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,713
-Connor almost drowned.
-I didn't mean to.

344
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,115
I mean I-I didn't do it.

345
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,816
Gosh, that's crazy.

346
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,484
And surprising.

347
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,486
Because it definitely didn't
have anything to do with me.

348
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,089
Are you feeling all right?

349
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:54,924
Why are you wet?

350
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:00,029
Connor. Are you okay?

351
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:01,730
Yeah. It was crazy.

352
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:05,400
I just remember there was smoke
and glitter.

353
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,436
And then the next thing I knew,

354
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:09,939
I was saved by the new girl.

355
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:11,406
The new girl?

356
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,443
The new girl.

357
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,880
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Whoo!

358
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:18,982
New girl.

359
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:20,482
She's going to say something.

360
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,185
-Shh.
-Picture this,

361
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,753
me, stunning but approachable,

362
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,156
on my first day of school.

363
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,624
I'm lost and confused,

364
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,994
struggling to find
my first class.

365
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,628
When suddenly----

366
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:35,898
I spot little mister skater boy
here barely above water.

367
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,900
-I'm just lucky that...
-Oh.

368
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,735
Shush, shush. Ooh. My story.

369
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:43,505
Now, I'm not much of a swimmer,
but in that moment,

370
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:46,875
I remembered what my mother
always told me:

371
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,844
"You are gorgeous."

372
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,446
Also, "Big risk, big reward.

373
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,548
Always go big."

374
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:58,654
And what is bigger
than saving a life?

375
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,091
Yes, queen. Get it.

376
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,993
I love you so much.

377
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:05,661
Love you, too, rando.

378
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,796
She pointed at me. I'm Rando.

379
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,501
Oh, no. What's happening?

380
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,702
-Watch it.
-Ah. Excuse me.

381
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,204
Wait.

382
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:16,672
We haven't met.

383
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:19,574
I'm Chelsea,
Chelsea Van Der Zee.

384
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:22,544
-It's Dutch. <i>Kusjes!</i>
-So exotic.

385
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:23,679
I love you.

386
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,547
-And you are?
-I'm, um...

387
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,916
I'm Ruby Gillman.

388
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,784
It's Canadian... eh.

389
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,254
Okay, maybe it's the whole
"don't look at me" vibe,

390
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:33,256
but there's something different
about you.

391
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,959
I-I really gotta go now.

392
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:42,831
-Uh, are you good?
-What's wrong with her?

393
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,866
Yeah, you might need
to lie down for a little bit.

394
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,169
Yeah, that's awkward.

395
00:17:46,202 --> 00:17:47,971
What's her deal?

396
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,571
Is she gonna barf?

397
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,707
Freaking out.

398
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,808
Are you okay?

399
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:55,078
You really look like
you've been through something.

400
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:57,846
Yeah. I really got to go. Now.

401
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,549
All right, everyone.

402
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:03,752
Show's over.
Let's get back to class.

403
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,231
Welcome to your new home,

404
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:16,598
if I may be so bold.

405
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,001
-Ooh.
-This is incredible.

406
00:18:18,034 --> 00:18:20,103
Oh, you've picked a great place
to raise a kid.

407
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:21,904
It's so safe here in Oceanside.

408
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:25,741
Moving my family here was
the best decision I ever made.

409
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:27,542
Doug actually grew up here.

410
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:29,245
We're moving back so that
we can be closer to his folks

411
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:30,879
when the little one comes.

412
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:32,281
Hello, free babysitting.

413
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:34,883
How nice.

414
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,651
Just be careful
they don't tell you

415
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,854
how you should live your life
and raise your children.

416
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:42,125
I mean, it'll be so nice
to have family nearby.

417
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:44,559
You're very lucky.

418
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,909
Oh, why am I glowing?

419
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,110
Glowing is not good.

420
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:02,811
I will never go into
the ocean again.

421
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,147
Lesson learned.

422
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,614
Call Mom.

423
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:07,050
Video call Connor.

424
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,085
What? I didn't say that.
Call Mom.

425
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:10,286
Ruby, where'd you go?

426
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,787
Whoa. Hey.

427
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,122
End call, end call, end call.

428
00:19:13,156 --> 00:19:14,190
Wait, I wanted
to ask you some...

429
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:14,924
I'm going through a tunnel.

430
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:16,192
Call Mom.

431
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,927
No, I can't call Mom.

432
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,262
She's gonna kill me.

433
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:22,165
Mm?

434
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:25,935
There's three of them?

435
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:28,304
Oh, this is a nightmare.

436
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,209
No!

437
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:34,277
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

438
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,116
Hello?

439
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:46,788
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

440
00:19:46,822 --> 00:19:48,790
You're a long way from home.

441
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:52,061
What are you doing
in True Crime?

442
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,143
Shh.

443
00:20:19,821 --> 00:20:21,756
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

444
00:20:27,997 --> 00:20:29,731
A lot of you have been asking
about my beard regimen.

445
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:30,866
Do you see that?

446
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,268
-Kraken!
-What is that?

447
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:34,203
-Kraken ahoy! She's back!
-Oh, my goodness.

448
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,105
Oh, she's coming for me.

449
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,172
-Oh. Look at this view.
-Wow.

450
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:12,275
Holy migoli, this is amazing.

451
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:13,775
What do you think, boo?

452
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:16,445
I think... we're sold!

453
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,914
Oh. Fantastic.

454
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,415
Well, I'll get
the paperwork started,

455
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,983
and we'll make this quick
and easy

456
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:22,784
so you can focus
on your little one.

457
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:24,120
-I can't believe this is ours.
-Look at this house.

458
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:25,887
-This is beautiful.
-Honey, you were saying

459
00:21:25,922 --> 00:21:28,090
you wanted a built-in grill,
and that is built-in.

460
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:30,259
Oh, man, I get
to be grillmaster again.

461
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:32,827
You make sure you enjoy

462
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:34,463
every minute of quiet
you have left

463
00:21:34,497 --> 00:21:36,232
because once the baby comes,
it is going to blow up

464
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:38,301
-your whole life.
-Okay. Okay.

465
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,205
Look around.
Get a feel for the place.

466
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:44,407
Just leave the key in
the lockbox when you're done.

467
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,807
Or-or keep it.

468
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,944
Whatever. Talk soon.

469
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,981
<i>Pick up, Ruby. Pick up.</i>

470
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:54,417
Oh, pick up, Ruby. Pick up!

471
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,817
Okay.

472
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,154
Agatha, you can figure this out.

473
00:21:58,187 --> 00:22:00,022
Everything is gonna be fine.

474
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:02,325
Son of an anglerfish!

475
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:10,099
It's probably
just a traffic cone.

476
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:13,302
Oh, no.

477
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:18,007
Hello?

478
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:29,285
Heya, sis.

479
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:32,854
Good old Uncle Brill's here
to see his favorite niece Ruby.

480
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,258
-What? Brill?
-Heya.

481
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,426
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

482
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,995
Why wouldn't I be?

483
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:40,529
I just hit you with a car.

484
00:22:40,563 --> 00:22:42,365
How do you guys deal with
the gravity here on land?

485
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:43,933
It's crazy, right?

486
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:46,569
Anyway, I came
to say congratulations.

487
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:49,005
Ruby's all grown-up
and turned into a giant...

488
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:51,407
Shh, shh, shh. Not so loud.

489
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,942
-Come on.
-Whoa.

490
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,277
I see you still got that
upper body strength, huh?

491
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,146

We felt the pulse.

503
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:20,503
So Mom knows?

504
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:21,870
Uh, yeah.

505
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,439
She sent me to get Ruby.

506
00:23:23,472 --> 00:23:26,542
This is exactly why she wasn't
supposed to go into the ocean.

507
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,177
Uh, then why would you
live next to it?

508
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,979
-We needed to stay moist.
-Ew. Moist.

509
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:31,347
Where is she? Where is she?

510
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,049

-Whoa.

511
00:23:33,082 --> 00:23:34,917

519

Ruby Gillman, come out here.

520
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,975
We need to get you home
right now.

521
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:02,611
But...

522
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:06,215
I'm a... a monster.

523
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,585
Oh, honey,
you're not a monster.

524
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:11,454
Not even close.

525
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:16,058
I don't want to yell.
Can we just talk?

526
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,130
Please, just...
just talk to me.

527
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,181
Hey, there's my girl.

528
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:42,118
Please don't be mad.
I should have listened to you.

529
00:24:42,151 --> 00:24:43,586
But I kind of

530
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:45,388
-went into the ocean.
-Went into the ocean?

531
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:48,524
I know. But right now I just
want to keep you safe, honey,

532
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:49,658
and that means
getting you home.

533
00:24:49,692 --> 00:24:52,094
Mom, look at me.

534
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:56,465
I won't even fit
inside our house anymore.

535
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,134
-Mom.
-Hey.

536
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,702
Hey, hey. Shh.

537
00:24:59,735 --> 00:25:02,605
You'll get small again.
It just takes a little time.

538
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:04,507
I'm here. I'll wait with you.

539
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,674
I'm not going anywhere.

540
00:25:07,176 --> 00:25:09,478
I'm really glad
you're here, Mom.

541
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,617
Do you remember when you found
that whale on the beach?

542
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:18,487
You mean
Clarence J. Whifferton?

543
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:19,722
How could I forget?

544
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,690
Clarence J. Whifferton.

545
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:24,560
You stood next to him
with a hose for seven hours

546
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:26,028
until the tide came back in.

547
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,997
Oh, yeah.

548
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,298
I asked you
if I could keep him.

549
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,033
Where would we even
have put him?

550
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,568
We had a hose. A garage.

551
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:35,404
Come on. I would have
taken care of him.

552
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,139
I know you would have.

553
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:47,483
Yes. I'm normal.

554
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:50,186
Well, almost normal. Thank you.

555
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:53,122
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

556
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:54,623
Aw...

557
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,062
Ooh, I see you got
your mom's arm strength.

558
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,698
Mom, what is happening?!

559
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,737
Hey, Tadpole. What's up?

560
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:10,606
How would I know?
No one tells me anything.

561
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,041
Ruby went into
the ocean, Arthur.

562
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:13,676
-Oh, no!
-And you didn't die?

563
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:15,478
-Die? Why would she die?
-Oh, no.

564
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:16,745
-Who's this guy?
-Who's this kid?

565
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,147
Uh, that's our son, Sam.

566
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,616
Son? As in,
I'm an uncle? Again?

567
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:22,251
I've never had an uncle before.

568
00:26:22,284 --> 00:26:25,087
And I've never had
a nephew before.

569
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:31,126
Ruby, take a deep breath.

570
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:33,362
Let me explain.

571
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:36,298
You see, when you went
in the ocean, it triggered...

572
00:26:36,332 --> 00:26:37,766
Uh, it released...

573
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,368
The kraken!

574
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:45,741
What Brill means

575
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:49,311
is you turn into
a giant kraken.

576
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:53,115
I know this is a lot
to process, Ruby,

577
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:55,284
but you're not alone.

578
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:00,523
I turn into
a giant kraken, too.

579
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,193
What? What?

580
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:05,628
You knew?

581
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:09,331
So, I'm this?

582
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:11,267
The horrible stereotype
of krakens

583
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,168
that you said humans made up.

584
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:15,271
-I'm offended.
-It sells.

585
00:27:15,304 --> 00:27:16,805
So what else is true
about me, Mom?

586
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,675
Do I sink ships now?
Do I terrorize sailors?

587
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,343
No. No, honey. Not at all.

588
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:23,846
All this time, you told me
we were hiding from monsters,

589
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:26,415
and it turns out
I'm the monster.

590
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:27,683
You lied to me.

591
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,685
Think of it more as
a tiny omission.

592
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:31,554
Come on. Turn giant.
I'm recording.

593
00:27:31,587 --> 00:27:32,821
Sam, put it away.

594
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,557
But this is
the coolest thing ever.

595
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,191
It is not cool.

596
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:38,627
I was already a little weird,
but this?

597
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,629
-I can't hide this.
-Yes, you can.

598
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:42,164
You don't get it, Mom.

599
00:27:42,197 --> 00:27:45,701
Every single day,
I make sure no one notices

600
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:47,369
all the ways
that I am different.

601
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:49,338
I push my hair
in front of my gills,

602
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:51,440
and I stand
like I have a spine.

603
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:55,110
It's hard,
but this is impossible.

604
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:57,179
No, because you can
control it, Ruby.

605
00:27:57,212 --> 00:27:59,415
Just like I have
for all these years.

606
00:27:59,448 --> 00:28:02,751
Yeah, but you didn't have to go
to high school with tentacles.

607
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:04,386
Do I get tentacles, too?

608
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,222
Sorry, son. Only the women
in our family turn giant.

609
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,791
The men just become older,
rounder versions of ourselves.

610
00:28:08,824 --> 00:28:09,825
It's not great.

611
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,460
Ruby, listen.

612
00:28:11,493 --> 00:28:12,861
The ocean triggers
the transformation.

613
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:14,129
But if you stay on dry land,

614
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:15,598
you'll stay small
and on two legs.

615
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,800
Cool. Everyone at school
is talking about the monster

616
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:20,235
that destroyed the library.

617
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,871
As long as no one figures out
it was you, we're safe.

618
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:24,707
Your body is going
through changes.

619
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,542
Think of it as blossoming.

620
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:27,843
Ugh, Dad.

621
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,478
Do your tentacles ooze poison?

622
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,180
-Sam! -How is this even
happening right now?

623
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:32,348
As long as you stay
out of the ocean...

624
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:33,882
Your body is a flower.

625
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,218
-Do you grow any extra arms?
-Blossoming.

626
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:37,753
-Women are so lucky.
-Things will go back to normal.

627
00:28:37,786 --> 00:28:40,656
Can everyone just stop?!

628
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,627
Dad, this isn't a good thing.

629
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,496
Sam, I'm going to strangle you
with my tentacles.

630
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:48,831
And, Mom, I can't.

631
00:28:48,864 --> 00:28:50,399
I just can't right now.

632
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:54,503
Ah, she forgot to do me.

633
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,472
I don't even know you!

634
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,281
Well, why can't we
just talk about it?

635
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:07,951
Because it doesn't matter.

636
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,284
Keep it down, Brill.

637
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:10,386
Sis, if I could find you,

638
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:11,787
then it's only a matter of time

639
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,956
before the rest
of the ocean can, too.

640
00:29:12,989 --> 00:29:14,924
I can handle this on my own.

641
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,892
Just come home and talk to her.

642
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:18,527
She wants to help Ruby.

643
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,329
She never just helps, though,
does she?

644
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,531
At least tell Ruby
the whole truth.

645
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:24,400
Ruby's life
is on land now, Brill.

646
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,869
I know you mean well,
but you need to stop.

647
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:29,338
Go home and let me take care
of my daughter.

648
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:31,507
Aggie...

649
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:41,450
I can't believe Mom is still
hiding things from me.

650
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:46,889
Nessie, you tiny genius.

651
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:49,792
That guy can't hide anything.

652
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,600
Oh, put those on ice.

653
00:29:58,634 --> 00:29:59,903
Good idea.

654
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,470
I can do both for you.

655
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:04,573
Wha...

656
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:05,874
Lock your doors!

657
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:07,911
The kraken has returned!

658
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,678
Brill?

659
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,582
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

660
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:24,994
-Brill? -Get off me,
you feathery demons.

661
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:27,463
Ow! You winged dopes.

662
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,364
Ow, hey, hey.

663
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:32,001
Save yourself.
It's too late for me.

664
00:30:32,035 --> 00:30:33,502
Forget the corn dog.

665
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:35,704
Did you see that?
They took my stick snack.

666
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:37,040
Uncle Brill, focus.

667
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:38,640
-I need to know.
-Mm-hmm?

668
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,609
Who sent you here?

669
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:42,411
Mmm. No. No, no, no. No.

670
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:43,879
Please don't ask me things.

671
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:45,714
I'm so bad at keeping secrets.

672
00:30:45,748 --> 00:30:47,349
Just talk to your mom.

673
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:49,451
-Mom won't tell me anything.
-Well, neither will I.

674
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,754
She should be the one to tell
you about your grandmother.

675
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:53,856
-My what?
-Nothing.

676
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:55,390
I didn't say grandmother. What?

677
00:30:55,424 --> 00:30:57,927
Uh, I said landlubber. Ahoy?

678
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:00,063
-I have a grandmother?
-No, no, no.

679
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,430
Please, uh, don't listen to me.

680
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:02,932
I don't know what I'm saying.

681
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,700
-I'm hungry, and I'm
traumatized from before. -Wait.

682
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,368
-It's the birds... -If only
the women in our family

683
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,504
turn into giant krakens,

684
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:11,040
then she's a giant kraken, too.

685
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:13,442
Uh, let the record show
I kept that part a secret.

686
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:14,978
-Is she here?
-What? No.

687
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:16,913
Your grandmother would never
leave the ocean.

688
00:31:16,946 --> 00:31:18,915
Honestly, I don't know how your
mom did it all these years.

689
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:22,684
Land is not built
for a giant kraken.

690
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:24,988
-You're right.
-Mm-hmm.

691
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:27,389
It's not.

692
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:32,461
I don't know the first thing
about being a giant kraken.

693
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:34,663
But it's not fair
to keep me in the dark.

694
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:35,464
Nope. Not at all.

695
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:38,500
I can't keep waiting
for answers.

696
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:49,078
I need to take control
of my own life.

697
00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:50,412
You go, girl.

698
00:31:50,445 --> 00:31:51,814
-I'm a kraken.
-Preach.

699
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:53,116
And if I want answers,
then there's only one person

700
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:54,883
-who can help me.
-Your mom.

701
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,019
My grandmother.

702
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:57,086
Yeah. No. What?

703
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,554
I can't let you do that.

704
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:00,422
Your mom will kill me.

705
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:04,726
Uncle Brill...

706
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,896
you have been more helpful
than you can imagine.

707
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,471
You know, this is the first hug
we've had in 15 years.

708
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:20,709
Then I'm really sorry.

709
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:22,711
-For what?
-This.

710
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,915
Oh! A stick snack.

711
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,155
Help!

712
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:16,465
Real clever
with the stick trick.

713
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:19,102
I admit that, but... Whoa.

714
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:22,038
Yeah. It's kind of amazing.

715
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:23,538
So, there's no way
I'm getting you

716
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:25,574
out of the water now, is there?

717
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,977
Well, follow me.

718
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:30,013
Wait, Uncle Brill.

719
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:31,780

is more wonderful
than anything I could imagine.

That was wild.

750
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:58,134
Welcome to
the Kingdom of the Krakens.

751
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:34,303
Whoa.

752
00:35:34,337 --> 00:35:36,039
Yeah,
I know what you're thinking.

753
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:37,173
It's a little over the top.

754
00:35:37,206 --> 00:35:39,242
But you know royals.

755
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,309
Royals?

756
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:41,310
You mean my grandmother's a...

757
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,212
A queen!

758
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:45,148
A warrior queen,

759
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,116
Ultimate Lordess,

760
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,252
Ruler of the Seven Seas,

761
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,120
et cetera, et cetera.

762
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:52,255
Give me a hug.

763
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,357
So tight.

764
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,259
-Oh.
-Not now, Brill.

765
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,692
It's Ruby's time now.

766
00:35:57,726 --> 00:35:59,828
You said you'd be okay
with it, huh?

767
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:00,662
Of course, Mamah.

768
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:01,931
I'm not that needy, so...

769
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:04,200
I can't believe
you're my grandmother.

770
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:08,371
Please, call me Grandmamah.

771
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,206
You seem surprised by the level

772
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,675
of general majesty
and royal splendor.

773
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,745
I definitely wasn't expecting
the whole queen thing.

774
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:19,949
Your mother never told you
you were royalty?

775
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:22,251
I guess it was another
tiny omission.

776
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:24,153
Tiny omission?!

777
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:26,022
Agatha!

778
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,727
Don't worry.
I go to therapy now.

779
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:35,364
I see a wise hammerhead shark
on Wednesdays and Fridays,

780
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:37,033
and I've let my rage go.

781
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,834
Away, rage.

782
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,735
Ah, cookies.

783
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:43,672
Help yourself, Ruby.

784
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:46,242
Mmm. They're really...
they're really good.

785
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:47,642
A little mushy.

786
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:49,644
I made someone
make them myself.

787
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:52,381
Now, talk to your grandmamah.

788
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:54,050
Tell me everything.

789
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:57,220
Was it horrible living among
the hairy crust dwellers?

790
00:36:57,253 --> 00:36:58,887
You mean people?

791
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:01,656
Even the word makes
my tentacles squirm.

792
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,126
People are kinda nice,
actually.

793
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,327
I have a couple of friends.

794
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,894
I asked a boy to prom,

795
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:07,896
but, you know,
it... it did not go great.

796
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,732
Well, deary, you can put
all that behind you.

797
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:13,002
You're made for bigger things.

798
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:14,669
Come with me.

799
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:20,675
I see her. It's Ruby.

800
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:22,145
Whoa. It's Ruby.

801
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:24,380
-It's her.
-Look, it's the princess.

802
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:25,881
Is this actually her?

803
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:27,250
Aw. Thank you.

804
00:37:27,283 --> 00:37:28,683
Is that Ruby?

805
00:37:28,717 --> 00:37:30,153
Look, look. It's her.

806
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:31,387
She's so pretty.

807
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,756
Hi, Ruby.

808
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,728
Fellow krakens,

809
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:43,299
here at last
is my granddaughter.

810
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:45,700
After 15 years,

811
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:48,404
Princess Ruby has finally
returned home

812
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:52,008
to be my successor.

813
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:57,446
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

814
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,148
I'm gonna be a, a what now?

815
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,983
Ruby, you're a princess.

816
00:38:01,017 --> 00:38:02,784
Address the crowd.

817
00:38:06,355 --> 00:38:09,225
I think...

818
00:38:09,258 --> 00:38:12,361
I am having a panic attack!

819
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,997
Panic attack!

820
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:37,220
So, Grandma...

821
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:38,820
Uh, "Grandmamah."

822
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:40,755
It goes up on the second "mah."

823
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:43,226
Oh, sorry. Um, Grandmamah,

824
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:44,826
um, you have the wrong person.

825
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:47,829
I'm just Ruby Gillman,
normal teenager.

826
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,432
Normal according to who?

827
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:50,967
The women in our family

828
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,269
have been gifted
the mighty power

829
00:38:53,302 --> 00:38:55,837
to turn into giant kraken.

830
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,909
You are only one of three giant
krakens on this Earth, Ruby.

831
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:03,212
We must protect the ocean
and its creatures.

832
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:06,148
But many monsters have coveted
our position

833
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:09,518
and have tried to seize
the throne for themselves.

834
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:12,989
Brag alert,
they never succeeded.

835
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:14,390
The Leviathan,

836
00:39:14,423 --> 00:39:15,992
Umibozu,

837
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:19,128
and the most power-hungry
and dangerous of them all...

838
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:21,397
The mermaid?

839
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,466
Yes, the mermaid!

840
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:25,268
But people love mermaids.

841
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,403
Of course they do.

842
00:39:27,436 --> 00:39:29,138
People are stupid.

843
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:33,242
Mermaids are selfish,
vain narcissists

844
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:34,577
with mediocre hair,

845
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,514
and their queen, Nerissa,
the worst of them all.

846
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:40,249
She wanted to control the ocean

847
00:39:40,283 --> 00:39:44,420
and force its creatures
to serve her and her alone.

848
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:48,291
Normally, mermaids would be
no match for us giant kraken--

849
00:39:48,324 --> 00:39:49,959
much too puny--

850
00:39:49,992 --> 00:39:53,162
but their queen found
an ancient weapon,

851
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,364
the Trident of Oceanus.

852
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:59,535
The only weapon powerful enough
to defeat a giant kraken.

853
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,870
We formed the front lines
against her,

854
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:03,973
and for that...

855
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:07,876
...we paid a terrible price.

856
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,313
Frankly, I suppose
we'd all be kelp toast

857
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:13,182
if it wasn't for your mother.

858
00:40:13,215 --> 00:40:14,383
No way.

859
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,551
That's my mom?

860
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,919
Was she actually cool?

861
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:18,454
She was our greatest warrior.

862
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:20,456
I mean, of course she was.
I taught her everything I know.

863
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:24,060
She engaged in a great battle
with the tyrant mermaid

864
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:26,462
and wrested away the Trident.

865
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:29,398
I called it
her "queen-making moment."

866
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:31,467
It was glorious.

867
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,603
Nerissa fled in disgrace.

868
00:40:34,637 --> 00:40:38,074
We had a chance
to crush the mermaids forever,

869
00:40:38,107 --> 00:40:40,209
but your mother did
the unfathomable.

870
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:41,977
She hid the Trident away,

871
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,313
left her kingdom,
left her kind,

872
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:47,083
all to play human?

873
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:50,986
Whoa.

874
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,355
You have laser eyes?

875
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:55,391
Well, it's electrically charged
bioluminescence,

876
00:40:55,424 --> 00:40:57,927
but, yeah,
they do pack a wallop.

877
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,562
You have the powers,
too, you know.

878
00:40:59,595 --> 00:41:02,897
Besides growing big
at super awkward moments?

879
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,967
You're special, Ruby.

880
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,137
You feel it
in the core of your being.

881
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,972
Let me teach you.

882
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:12,641
But my mom told me that
if I stay out of the ocean,

883
00:41:12,675 --> 00:41:14,243
I won't turn into a...

884
00:41:14,276 --> 00:41:15,211
A giant kraken?

885
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:18,447
You are not a human
who turns into a kraken.

886
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:22,618
You're a kraken
hiding as a human.

887
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:24,520
Once you know
what you're capable of,

888
00:41:24,553 --> 00:41:26,989
you'll want to be
the next kraken queen.

889
00:41:27,022 --> 00:41:28,958
It's your birthright.

890
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:32,128
And fight as you might,
fight as you will,

891
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:35,598
you can never outswim
your destiny.

892
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,400
I don't know, Grandmamah.

893
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,702
I like math and Connor.

894
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:43,305
You know, teen stuff.

895
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,208
Very well.

896
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:50,079
I loved spending this time
with you, Ruby.

897
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:51,981
Me, too.

898
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:54,016
Thank you for telling me
the truth.

899
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:56,919
Until we meet again.

900
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:01,524
Wait. You're just gonna
let her go?

901
00:42:01,557 --> 00:42:03,058
She'll be back.

902
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:05,227
A kraken always
answers the call.

903
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:08,397
That's what you said
about Agatha.

904
00:42:19,542 --> 00:42:21,177
Bye, Clarence.

905
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:34,523
Kraken ahoy!

906
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,330
Davey, hard to port.
Full power!

907
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:54,243
Fly. Fly, me beauties.

908
00:42:56,045 --> 00:42:58,013
Wha...

909
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:01,650
Let's get a closer look at ya.

910
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:07,356
Laser eyes, go!

911
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,258
Laser eyes, go!

912
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,092
Laser eyes?

913
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,495
Hold her steady, Davey.

914
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:25,174
Bit of a spicy tuna, aren't ya?

915
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:28,043
-Wait. Is that...?
-The new girl.

916
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:29,745
Oh, my gosh. Hey.

917
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:32,214
Chelsea?
H-How are you even down here?

918
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:37,653
Because
I'm a motherflippin' mermaid.

919
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:39,188
I figured I owed you
an underwater rescue

920
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:43,058
since I kinda, sorta, 100%
got credit for yours.

921
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:45,394
Time for the Gordon special.

922
00:43:45,427 --> 00:43:48,264
Surprise. It's a bomb!

923
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:52,268
We should get going
or, like, die. Your call.

924
00:44:05,514 --> 00:44:07,550
Don't say it, Davey.

925
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,485
You're such a naysayer.

926
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:14,189
Okay.

927
00:44:14,223 --> 00:44:15,791
I still can't believe
you're a...

928
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:17,693
A ten with a fin?
A fish come true?

929
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:20,229
A mermaid?

930
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:22,431
Ooh, I can't believe I can
finally have a friend

931
00:44:22,464 --> 00:44:24,166
to share things with.

932
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:26,569
A super sea-girl bestie.

933
00:44:26,602 --> 00:44:29,438
Look, Chelsea, thanks for what
you did back there,

934
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:33,342
but I started this day thinking
that my biggest issue was prom.

935
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:36,679
And now, I got
a whole lot more going on.

936
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:38,447
So I just need to go home,

937
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,584
get some sleep and pretend
this day never happened.

938
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:44,887
Look, I just thought
we had a lot in common,

939
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:49,525
but if you're gonna be salty
about it, then bye-bye.

940
00:45:12,514 --> 00:45:13,882
Okay, Ruby, you got this.

941
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,818
You just need
to make it to school

942
00:45:15,851 --> 00:45:18,520
and have a completely,
totally ordinary day.

943
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:20,689
Huh?

944
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:27,863
Honey,

945
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:30,366
you've gotta stop
beating yourself up.

946
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:31,467
Oh, Arthur.

947
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,769
I can't believe I didn't
tell her any of this sooner.

948
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:35,304
I mean, what was I thinking?

949
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:37,606
You were thinking about
protecting her,

950
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,908
like you always have.

951
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:40,743
What if she drops out
of school?

952
00:45:40,776 --> 00:45:42,912
I mean, what if she doesn't get
a job and runs away like I did?

953
00:45:42,946 --> 00:45:46,849
What if she hates me
like I hate my mom?

954
00:45:46,882 --> 00:45:48,784
It's a slippery slope, Arthur.

955
00:45:48,817 --> 00:45:50,552
Hate's a strong word.

956
00:45:50,586 --> 00:45:51,720
And she loves you.

957
00:45:51,754 --> 00:45:53,522
She'll never run away.

958
00:45:59,294 --> 00:46:00,964
Huh. This doesn't help my case.

959
00:46:00,997 --> 00:46:02,966
Ruby, hey. How are you feeling?

960
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,801
Did you sleep okay?
Everything back to normal?

961
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:07,670
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Totally fine.

962
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:09,939
Are you sure?
Oh, you look a little flushed.

963
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:12,574
Mom, I'm fine. Really.

964
00:46:16,845 --> 00:46:19,815
Ruby, is that salt water
on your breath?

965
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:21,550
Salt water? What?

966
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,885
No. I really gotta go.

967
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:24,853
Good. Okay.
Well, if you do want to talk,

968
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:26,321
I'll be right here.

969
00:46:26,355 --> 00:46:27,890
I just... I just really
want you to know

970
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:29,825
that you never have
to hide things from me.

971
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:31,827
-Hmm, like you?
-What did you say, honey?

972
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,629
Nothing. Bye, Mom.

973
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:35,631
Love you. Make good choices.

974
00:46:41,737 --> 00:46:43,872
♪ High ♪

975
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:46,241

976
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:48,277

977
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,313
It destroyed the YA Zombie
Romance section.

978
00:46:51,346 --> 00:46:54,249
The YA Zombie Romance section!

979
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:55,451
-Eric.
-Yeah.

980
00:46:55,484 --> 00:46:57,252
-Take a look at this.
-Nonfiction?

981
00:46:57,286 --> 00:46:58,587
Mom, I changed my mind.
I want to be homeschooled again.

982
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,023
I never liked that
library anyway.

983
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:01,590
We have a library?

984
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:03,026
Godzilla could not beat
that thing in a fight.

985
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:04,259
A tentacled freak
from the deep shows up,

986
00:47:04,293 --> 00:47:05,828
and I'm supposed to learn math?

987
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:06,930
So gross.

988
00:47:06,963 --> 00:47:08,464
There you are!

989
00:47:08,497 --> 00:47:09,966
Why'd you stop answering
our texts last night?

990
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:11,667
I was worried
that monster got to you.

991
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,470
I carved us each a whistle
out of juniper wood.

992
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:16,005
Blowing it could give you
precious seconds

993
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,873
to abscond with your lives.

994
00:47:17,907 --> 00:47:19,042
Sick. Juniper wood
has been known

995
00:47:19,075 --> 00:47:20,910
to have kraken-defeating powers.

996
00:47:20,944 --> 00:47:22,344
What? Kraken?

997
00:47:22,377 --> 00:47:23,746
Why would you say that?

998
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,915
Ev-Everyone knows that krakens
aren't real, so...

999
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:27,483
Behold, a plot twist.

1000
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:30,819
15 years ago,
you all laughed at me.

1001
00:47:30,853 --> 00:47:32,488
Sorry. Not you, Davey.

1002
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:34,423
You're right,
you always believed me.

1003
00:47:34,456 --> 00:47:38,660
But now I finally have proof
that krakens exist.

1004
00:47:38,694 --> 00:47:41,363
A lot of you have been asking
about my beard regimen.

1005
00:47:41,396 --> 00:47:42,731
Kraken!

1006
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:44,800
Kraken ahoy! She's back!

1007
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:48,037
Oh, she's coming for me.

1008
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:51,040
Davey,
get the picturephone.

1009
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:54,043
Do you see it?

1010
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:56,378
With your help,
we will drag this abomination

1011
00:47:56,411 --> 00:48:01,583
into the light and finally
reveal what it truly is.

1012
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:05,788
Can't help
but root for that guy.

1013
00:48:05,821 --> 00:48:10,559
A great darkness has risen
from the depths to claim us all.

1014
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,929
And this time,
she is not catastrophizing.

1015
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:14,797
I mean, this is wacky Gordon.

1016
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,032
You can't take him seriously.

1017
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:18,333
He only has, like,
ten subscribers.

1018
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:19,701
-For now.
-Huh?

1019
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:21,737
Trevin is sharing it across
all of his socials.

1020
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,472
-He's what? -What? You've never
heard of my channel?

1021
00:48:23,505 --> 00:48:24,706
A lot of people watch
my gaming live streams.

1022
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,042
How many is a lot?

1023
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:28,011
About a hundred and forty...
thousand.

1024
00:48:28,044 --> 00:48:31,080
And... video posted.

1025
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:32,614
-There, it's out there
forever now. -Wait.

1026
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:34,483
Kraken! Kraken! Kraken ahoy!

1027
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:35,818
Dude, can you believe it?

1028
00:48:35,851 --> 00:48:37,586
-Kraken! Kraken!
-That old boat dude was right.

1029
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,888
-Kraken ahoy!
-That thing is legit a monster.

1030
00:48:39,923 --> 00:48:41,590
A real-life monster.

1031
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:43,892
Ruby? Cue Ruby.

1032
00:48:44,961 --> 00:48:46,662
Bliss, get the smelling salts.

1033
00:48:48,031 --> 00:48:49,698
Where are you going?

1034
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:51,100
You forgot your whistle!

1035
00:48:51,134 --> 00:48:52,868
Kraken! Kraken!

1036
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:54,436
Kraken ahoy!

1037
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:56,471
Kraken! Kraken!

1038
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:58,607
-Kraken ahoy!
-No running in the halls.

1039
00:49:08,952 --> 00:49:10,886
With a kraken running loose,

1040
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,487
you could use a bodyguard.

1041
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:13,522
Aw, you're sweet.

1042
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:14,756
The monster could be lurking

1043
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,824
around any corner.

1044
00:49:15,858 --> 00:49:16,993
I'd fight it for you.

1045
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:18,393
Chelsea?

1046
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:19,628
Can I talk to you?

1047
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:21,730
Okay, everyone out.

1048
00:49:21,763 --> 00:49:24,366
Private talk time. Bye.

1049
00:49:24,968 --> 00:49:26,735
So, what's up?

1050
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:28,905
Chelsea, about last night,
I am sorry that I ran...

1051
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:31,473
Oh. Apologies are so corny.

1052
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:34,043
Just skip to the part
where you tell me everything.

1053
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:36,012
Look, I...

1054
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:39,015
You are here on land one day,
and you already fit in.

1055
00:49:39,048 --> 00:49:42,784
I've been here all of my life,
and I still feel like a freak.

1056
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:46,923
I-I just want to be
Ruby Gillman, normal teenager.

1057
00:49:46,956 --> 00:49:49,993
Oh, boo.
Where's the fun in that?

1058
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:51,793
Ruby, you're a giant kraken.

1059
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:54,496
Don't you think you could aim
a little bit higher

1060
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:57,166
than "normal teenager"?

1061
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,104
Oh, my cute little, floppy,
baby guppy girl.

1062
00:50:01,137 --> 00:50:02,906
You know what you need?

1063
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:04,640
Great hair and a mermaid tail?

1064
00:50:04,673 --> 00:50:07,043
No, but it would help.

1065
00:50:07,076 --> 00:50:09,045
What you need, Ruby Gillman,

1066
00:50:09,078 --> 00:50:12,048
is to see how great
your life could be.

1067
00:50:12,081 --> 00:50:15,817
You need a super sea-girl
ditch day!

1068
00:50:16,752 --> 00:50:18,887
Okay. Let's do it.

1069
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:21,224
Yay!

1070
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:23,792
Just four more days until prom,

1071
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:25,627
the last evening of joy

1072
00:50:25,661 --> 00:50:28,164
before entering the drudgery
of adulthood.

1073
00:50:35,238 --> 00:50:37,006
-♪ I bought a ticket to life ♪
-Woo-hoo!

1074
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,573
-♪ Rose-colored eyes ♪
-Whoa!

1075
00:50:38,607 --> 00:50:42,145
♪ Made a home
in halls of mirrors ♪

1076
00:50:42,178 --> 00:50:44,680

1077
00:50:44,713 --> 00:50:49,953

00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:53,588

00:50:53,622 --> 00:50:57,626
♪ The less that I know

00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:01,830
♪ Was riding the carousel
up and down... ♪

1081
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:03,099
This day's been amazing.

1082
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:04,833
I mean,
seven seas in seven hours?

1083
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:06,768
And don't get me started
about how wrong they got

1084
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:09,105
the crystal jellyfish in the
<i>Marine Biologist Quarterly.</i>

1085
00:51:09,138 --> 00:51:11,773
Sorry.
Am I geeking out too much?

1086
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,775
No.

1087
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:22,584
I still can't believe your mom
hid all of this from you.

1088
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:25,221
"Hiding is surviving."

1089
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:26,788
That's the Gillman
family motto.

1090
00:51:26,822 --> 00:51:28,958
Mottoes are stupid.
That's my motto.

1091
00:51:28,992 --> 00:51:30,159
I hate hiding.

1092
00:51:30,193 --> 00:51:31,961
But you're crushing it
at school.

1093
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:33,262
Everyone loves you.

1094
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:35,164
You really do have everything.

1095
00:51:35,198 --> 00:51:36,798
No, I don't.

1096
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,135
Ever since
the Battle of the Trident,

1097
00:51:39,168 --> 00:51:41,636
all us mermaids
have been in hiding.

1098
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,605
I couldn't take it anymore.

1099
00:51:43,638 --> 00:51:46,943
I felt trapped, so I ran away.

1100
00:51:46,976 --> 00:51:51,047
But when I ended up
at Oceanside High, I was alone.

1101
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,849
No one could see the real me.

1102
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:58,754
And then I found you,
my super sea-girl bestie,

1103
00:51:58,787 --> 00:52:01,157
and now everything is right
in the world.

1104
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,759
If it wasn't for this whole
mermaid versus kraken war,

1105
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:07,030
you and I could be this free
all the time.

1106
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,597
Oh, sure. Yeah.

1107
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,035
But, I mean, two teenage girls
can't fix history.

1108
00:52:12,068 --> 00:52:15,271
Wait. What's the first rule
of being a mathlete?

1109
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:17,940
Hmm. Never talk about
being a mathlete?

1110
00:52:17,974 --> 00:52:20,943
No. We have to evaluate
the problem.

1111
00:52:20,977 --> 00:52:22,677
Chelsea, come on.

1112
00:52:22,711 --> 00:52:24,780
There must be some way
to end this war

1113
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:26,648
so you won't have to hide
from the krakens

1114
00:52:26,681 --> 00:52:28,784
and I won't have to become
a prophesied princess warrior

1115
00:52:28,817 --> 00:52:30,153
of an interspecies vendetta.

1116
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:34,023
Well, there is one way.

1117
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:35,757
Picture this:

1118
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:38,794
Chelsea Van Der Zee
and Ruby Gillman save the seas

1119
00:52:38,827 --> 00:52:41,730
by finding
the Trident of Oceanus.

1120
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:43,698
That giant fork
my grandma's so obsessed with?

1121
00:52:43,732 --> 00:52:46,369
Yes. The Trident.
Stay with me.

1122
00:52:46,402 --> 00:52:48,037
Once we have the Trident,

1123
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:50,339
we can show that there doesn't
have to be a war anymore.

1124
00:52:50,373 --> 00:52:54,709
It can be a symbol of peace.

1125
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:56,812
Then my grandmother wouldn't
have to train me for battle.

1126
00:52:56,845 --> 00:53:00,316
I can live in the ocean
and on land as the real me.

1127
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:01,951
No more fighting.

1128
00:53:01,984 --> 00:53:04,853
And the mermaids wouldn't have
to live in fear anymore.

1129
00:53:04,886 --> 00:53:06,089
No more hiding.

1130
00:53:06,122 --> 00:53:07,722
-No fighting.
-No hiding.

1131
00:53:07,756 --> 00:53:12,361
No fighting! No hiding!
No fighting! No hiding!

1132
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,297
I'm nervous about the barbecue.

1133
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,897
Oh, Carol, come on.

1134
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:18,367
No one knows what happened
exactly to the library.

1135
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:20,169
Sam, no headphones
at the table.

1136
00:53:20,203 --> 00:53:22,171
-It's completely gone.
-It could have been a gas leak.

1137
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:25,674
Trust me, your buyers are gonna
love Oceanside's tranquility.

1138
00:53:25,707 --> 00:53:27,110
Tranquility
has turned to terror

1139
00:53:27,143 --> 00:53:29,378
here in Oceanside
as more and more witnesses

1140
00:53:29,412 --> 00:53:31,847
report having seen
the giant kraken.

1141
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,250
Knock, knock. Who's there?

1142
00:53:34,283 --> 00:53:36,352
It's Uncle Brill.
I'm already inside.

1143
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:37,786
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

1144
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:39,922
Just one second, Carol.

1145
00:53:39,956 --> 00:53:41,690
What are you doing here?

1146
00:53:41,723 --> 00:53:43,825
When I came back empty-handed,
Mom hit the roof.

1147
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,428
I need a place to crash
till she cools down.

1148
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:47,196
A few months, a couple years.

1149
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,132
Century, tops.

1150
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:50,665
Um, hon, uh, this isn't good.

1151
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,868
I'm here
with Captain Gordon Lighthouse.

1152
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:55,138
Now, Mr. Lighthouse, you
allegedly claim to have seen...

1153
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:56,405
The face of death!

1154
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:58,274
Allegedly.

1155
00:53:58,307 --> 00:53:59,741
-Ow, ow, ow. Ow.
-You out there,

1156
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:02,744
I need any able-bodied man,
woman or child

1157
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:04,247
-to help crew my vessel
-Get off. Ow! Ooh.

1158
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,282
and capture the kraken!

1159
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:08,184
That guy's terrifying,

1160
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:09,885
and I live with a warlord.

1161
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,753
Aggie, he's got her on video.

1162
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:13,289
Agatha, are you still
there? What's going on?

1163
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:14,723
No, it's nothing.

1164
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:16,325
Bring your buyers Saturday.

1165
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:17,960
Uh-oh.

1166
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:19,794
-She's got that look.
-The one where she wants us

1167
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:22,431
to do something
we don't want to do.

1168
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:25,434
I've been searching for kraken
me entire life.

1169
00:54:25,468 --> 00:54:27,904
And it cost me dearly.

1170
00:54:27,937 --> 00:54:29,305
Oh, fine, yes.

1171
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:30,940
But if it wasn't
for the kraken,

1172
00:54:30,973 --> 00:54:32,408
I wouldn't have bought the boat,

1173
00:54:32,441 --> 00:54:34,043
and without the boat,
I wouldn't have

1174
00:54:34,076 --> 00:54:35,411
mortgaged my house, and if
I didn't mortgage my house,

1175
00:54:35,444 --> 00:54:37,446
Tammy wouldn't have left me.

1176
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,048
Huh. Been there.

1177
00:54:39,081 --> 00:54:40,849
Are we still
talking about krakens?

1178
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:42,817
Gordon, if it's from the ocean,
I'm your man.

1179
00:54:42,851 --> 00:54:44,987
And I can wield this baby,
no problem.

1180
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:47,290
He knows this should
only be handled

1181
00:54:47,323 --> 00:54:48,790
by a responsible adult.

1182
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:51,194
-Ooh, pointy.
-And who might you be?

1183
00:54:51,227 --> 00:54:52,962
Name's Brill. Born of the dirt,
live in the dirt,

1184
00:54:52,995 --> 00:54:55,730
will be buried in the dirt.
Don't like water.

1185
00:55:03,072 --> 00:55:04,407
Hmm.

1186
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,108
We call him Buckethead.

1187
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:08,477
He's not too bright, but he can
take a lot of punishment.

1188
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:11,180
Impressive.

1189
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:12,881
You're hired!

1190
00:55:12,915 --> 00:55:14,317
Buckethead, you're with me.

1191
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:17,987
Ah, now, don't be jelly, Davey.

1192
00:55:21,257 --> 00:55:23,092
Whoa.

1193
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,460
What is this place?

1194
00:55:24,493 --> 00:55:26,828
The Well of Seas.

1195
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:29,932
The source of all
the ocean's energy.

1196
00:55:29,966 --> 00:55:32,535
That's where your mother hid
the Trident of Oceanus.

1197
00:55:32,568 --> 00:55:35,037
She did? How did you know that?

1198
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:38,107
Because she took it from
my mother, the mermaid queen,

1199
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,308
and hid it in there.

1200
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:42,411
My mom died
trying to get it back.

1201
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:43,778
I am so sorry.

1202
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:45,248
It's not your fault.

1203
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:47,250
They were enemies.

1204
00:55:48,951 --> 00:55:50,519
So how are we supposed
to get it?

1205
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:53,822
Each current has its own force,
its own power.

1206
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,824
You have to swim through
all of the currents

1207
00:55:55,857 --> 00:55:58,827
to get to the center
where the Trident is hidden.

1208
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,364
Only a giant kraken
can survive it.

1209
00:56:01,397 --> 00:56:04,166
It has to be you, Ruby.

1210
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:06,402
Okay.

1211
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:09,038
It's just an underwater
volcano of death.

1212
00:56:09,071 --> 00:56:13,309
So, step one:
Evaluate the problem.

1213
00:56:30,192 --> 00:56:32,028
Okay. The problem is bad.

1214
00:56:32,061 --> 00:56:34,030
It's really bad.

1215
00:56:34,063 --> 00:56:37,933
Uh, we might need some help.

1216
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:44,040
Ruby. Oh, what a surprise.

1217
00:56:44,073 --> 00:56:45,541
Show me how to use my powers.

1218
00:56:45,574 --> 00:56:48,477
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

1219
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:53,149
Okay, where do we start?

1220
00:56:53,182 --> 00:56:55,318
-Laser eyes? -Before you fly
through the ocean,

1221
00:56:55,351 --> 00:56:56,919
you must first learn to swim.

1222
00:56:56,952 --> 00:56:58,254
You know my swimming
is pretty good,

1223
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,056
so maybe I could skip ahead

1224
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:02,925
and we could
unleash my laser eyes.

1225
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,994
Pew, pew. Pew, pew.

1226
00:57:05,428 --> 00:57:07,496
Whoa.

1227
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,632
You must accept
your "kraken-ness"

1228
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:12,834
and leave your land self behind.

1229

No. And yes. But no.

1376
01:03:38,754 --> 01:03:39,989
Ruby, you have to listen to me.

1377
01:03:40,023 --> 01:03:42,257
You don't understand

We left the ocean

1379
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,328
Don't worry.
She's not like her mom.

-Her mom?
-The mermaid queen.

1381
01:03:48,363 --> 01:03:50,766
She's the mermaid queen's
daughter?

1382
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,401
Yeah, but she's my friend.

1383
01:03:52,434 --> 01:03:54,436
She is not your friend.
She is dangerous.

1384
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:56,472
You sound like Grandmamah.

1385
01:03:56,505 --> 01:03:59,341
I'm sorry. I sound like who?

1386
01:03:59,374 --> 01:04:00,944
Grandmamah.
She's been training me.

1387
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:02,946

1388
01:04:02,979 --> 01:04:04,813

01:04:04,847 --> 01:04:08,350
Mom, don't you see? This is

1391

You do not know
the whole story.

1392
01:04:12,421 --> 01:04:13,856
And whose fault is that?

1393
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:15,290
Hey, I tried to talk to you.

1394
01:04:15,324 --> 01:04:16,391
I wanted to tell you
everything sooner,

1395
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,027
but I also needed
to keep you safe

1396
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,595
and give you a normal life.

1397
01:04:19,628 --> 01:04:22,031
Normal? Normal isn't hiding

1399
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:26,435

1402
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,641
Brill!

1403
01:04:33,642 --> 01:04:34,843
Distraction.

1404
01:04:34,877 --> 01:04:38,313
Hey, everybody. Um, watch how
high I can throw my nephew.

1405
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:42,384
Where'd he go?

1406
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:47,790
Ta-da!

1407
01:04:50,425 --> 01:04:53,896
We are gonna change the world
with or without you.

1408
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,664
Ruby, I get it. You're angry.

1409
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:56,365
You want to fight.

1410
01:04:56,398 --> 01:04:58,034
So did I when I was your age.

1411
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:00,103
But trust me,
this is the wrong fight.

1412
01:05:00,136 --> 01:05:01,670
You're on the wrong side.

1413
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:03,572
You can't tell me
how to live my life.

1414
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:05,808
Oh, yes, I can.
I am still your mother.

1415
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:08,011
You are forbidden
from going in the ocean again.

1416
01:05:08,044 --> 01:05:09,979
Now go home and calm down!

1417
01:05:20,856 --> 01:05:23,358
Agatha, are you okay?

1418
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:30,599
What happened?

1419
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:32,568
Ruby's made friends
with Nerissa's daughter.

1420
01:05:32,601 --> 01:05:33,435
Oh, no.

1421
01:05:33,468 --> 01:05:36,039
And my mother
has been training her.

1422
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:41,911
15 years, and she still
has her tentacles around me.

1423
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:42,979
What about Ruby?

1424
01:05:43,012 --> 01:05:44,948
Oh, she hates me right now.

1425
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:46,916
Go find her.

1426
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,952
Make sure she's safe.

1427
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:51,753
I'm gonna deal with my mother.

1428
01:05:59,095 --> 01:06:00,729
Ruby, wait.

1429
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:03,398
Are you okay?
What happened back there?

1430
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:05,601
My mom just wants things
to stay the same.

1431
01:06:05,634 --> 01:06:08,037
She wants me to stay the same.

1432
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:10,907
But this time,
I'm not turning back.

1433
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:24,519
Mother!

1434
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:31,027
And here I thought I knew
how to make an entrance.

1435
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,562
Stay away from my daughter.

1436
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:35,464
You mean my granddaughter?

1437
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:37,900
The princess?
The heir to the throne?

1438
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:39,501
Still trying to get your way.

1439
01:06:39,534 --> 01:06:41,637
Some things never change.

1440
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:42,939
You're trying to force
your daughter

1441
01:06:42,972 --> 01:06:45,041
into a life she doesn't want.

1442
01:06:45,074 --> 01:06:47,210
Now, where have I heard
that before?

1443
01:06:47,243 --> 01:06:49,913
The difference is
I didn't raise my daughter

1444
01:06:49,946 --> 01:06:51,647
to be a reflection of my glory.

1445
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,082
Well, that's certainly true.

1446
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:55,784
You raised her to run away
and hide.

1447
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:58,087
You still think
I was scared to fight.

1448
01:06:58,121 --> 01:07:00,189
You think it was easy
to start over?

1449
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,790
To risk everything?

1450
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,792
I never stopped fighting.

1451
01:07:03,825 --> 01:07:05,794
I fight for my family.

1452
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:07,529
I fight for who I love.

1453
01:07:07,562 --> 01:07:08,797
You?

1454
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,465
You just love to fight!

1455
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,102
She's just a kid.

1456
01:07:13,136 --> 01:07:15,138
A sweet, naive kid.

1457
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:17,073
And now she's in trouble.

1458
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:19,008
She made friends
with a mermaid.

1459
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:20,209
-What?
-Yes.

1460
01:07:20,243 --> 01:07:21,710
The daughter
of the mermaid queen.

1461
01:07:21,743 --> 01:07:24,013
Daughter? Nerissa never
had a daughter.

1462
01:07:25,181 --> 01:07:26,682
Ruby.

1463
01:08:10,293 --> 01:08:12,527
We did it.

1464
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:17,934
I've waited 15 years for this.

1465
01:08:19,302 --> 01:08:23,739
15 years of waiting to get
revenge on your mother...

1466
01:08:23,772 --> 01:08:24,407
What?

1467
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,641
...dethrone your grandmother

1468
01:08:26,675 --> 01:08:29,778
and lay waste
to the kraken kingdom.

1469
01:08:29,811 --> 01:08:30,812
Chelsea?

1470
01:08:30,846 --> 01:08:34,083
Oh, there is no Chelsea.

1471
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:38,154
I am Nerissa.

1472
01:08:38,187 --> 01:08:40,023
What's...
What's happening to you?

1473
01:08:40,056 --> 01:08:41,890
Surprised?

1474
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:43,759
I'm a flippin' mermaid.

1475
01:08:45,194 --> 01:08:48,864
And you're just
a dumb teenager.

1476
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:54,203
All that rah-rah-rah
was so that you could free this

1477
01:08:54,237 --> 01:08:55,905
for me, me, me.

1478
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:58,307
My super sea-girl bestie.

1479
01:08:58,341 --> 01:09:00,243
I trusted you.

1480
01:09:00,276 --> 01:09:02,912

Hello?

1496
01:10:32,135 --> 01:10:34,103
Is Mrs. Gillman home?

1497
01:10:34,137 --> 01:10:36,339
Knock, knock!

1498
01:10:36,372 --> 01:10:38,773
Hey! That house was in escrow!

1499
01:10:38,807 --> 01:10:40,742
-Run! Run!
-To the boat, Davey.

1500
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:42,345
There's kraken to kill.

1501
01:10:42,378 --> 01:10:43,845
-Wait!
-Gillman.

1502
01:10:43,879 --> 01:10:45,348
Are you here to help me
kill the monsters?

1503
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:47,716
-No. That's my wife.
-What?

1504
01:10:47,749 --> 01:10:50,886
But if she is a...
and-and you're her...

1505
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,721
that means...

1506
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:55,724
Please don't kill me,
kraken monster.

1507
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:57,293
Pull yourself together, man.

1508
01:10:57,326 --> 01:10:58,760
We've got a mermaid to hunt.

1509
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:01,030
Thanks. I needed that.

1510
01:11:01,063 --> 01:11:02,864
Where is my daughter?

1511
01:11:02,898 --> 01:11:04,866
Oh, we already said
our goodbyes.

1512
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,038
But not before
she gave me this.

1513
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,442
The greatest warrior
in the sea,

1514
01:11:13,476 --> 01:11:16,045
hiding amongst humans.

1515
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:17,779
What a waste.

1516
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:21,284
No one talks to my daughter
like that.

1517
01:11:21,317 --> 01:11:23,186
Except me.

1518
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:25,254
You've grown older, Queen.

1519
01:11:25,288 --> 01:11:27,356
Older and meaner.

1520
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,226
Lucky for me,
mermaids don't age.

1521
01:11:30,259 --> 01:11:33,795
Well, I hope you both put up
more of a fight than Ruby.

1522
01:11:37,366 --> 01:11:40,869
Ruby? Ruby?

1523
01:11:43,339 --> 01:11:45,241
Ruby!

1524
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:48,311
Don't worry.
I'll get you out of here...

1525
01:11:48,344 --> 01:11:50,279
...slowly.

1526
01:11:50,313 --> 01:11:52,949
I will get you out
of here slowly.

1527
01:11:55,084 --> 01:11:56,751
Oh, no.

1528
01:11:56,785 --> 01:11:59,088
What happened?

1529
01:11:59,121 --> 01:12:01,991
Getting the Trident was
supposed to make things better,

1530
01:12:02,024 --> 01:12:04,427
but all I did
was ruin everything.

1531
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,229
My mom was right.

1532
01:12:06,262 --> 01:12:08,998
I should have just gone home
like she said...

1533
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:12,034
...gone back to hiding
and stayed small.

1534
01:12:12,068 --> 01:12:15,071
What? No. Ruby,
that's not what your mom meant.

1535
01:12:15,104 --> 01:12:16,372
I promise.

1536
01:12:16,405 --> 01:12:17,974
You weren't there.

1537
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:19,841
Well, I may not know a lot
about a lot,

1538
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:21,510
but I know my sister.

1539
01:12:21,544 --> 01:12:24,480
Growing up, I was so proud
to be her brother.

1540
01:12:24,513 --> 01:12:26,848
She was powerful, confident.

1541
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:28,384
Everyone loved her.

1542
01:12:28,417 --> 01:12:30,819
But then she left,

1543
01:12:30,852 --> 01:12:32,388
and I could never understand

1544
01:12:32,421 --> 01:12:34,856
why she chose to leave
the ocean

1545
01:12:34,889 --> 01:12:38,561
until I saw the awesome life
she created on land.

1546
01:12:38,594 --> 01:12:43,266
And I realized,
your mom chose her own path.

1547
01:12:44,267 --> 01:12:46,768
She chose you.

1548
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:18,900
It's time to destroy
that Trident once and for all.

1549
01:13:18,934 --> 01:13:21,270
Yeah! Go get her, kiddo!

1550
01:13:23,139 --> 01:13:24,940
Whoa!

1551
01:13:29,612 --> 01:13:32,214
I'll be right there.

1552
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:36,285
Don't wait up, though.

1553
01:13:45,928 --> 01:13:48,397
Oh, it feels
so good to be back.

1554
01:13:48,431 --> 01:13:49,965
And this time,

1555
01:13:49,999 --> 01:13:53,868
I'm getting rid of you
for good.

1556
01:13:56,472 --> 01:13:58,307
Stay away from my mother!

1557
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:00,376

Pause. Rewind. Ruby?

1559
01:14:04,347 --> 01:14:06,215
You should be dead.

Ruby, behind you!

You'll never win, Ruby Gillman.

1588
01:16:04,733 --> 01:16:07,203
You're just a dumb teenager.

1589
01:16:07,236 --> 01:16:10,005
You know what's really pathetic?

1590
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:11,740
That you thought someone like me

1591
01:16:11,774 --> 01:16:15,644
could ever be friends
with a monster like you.

1592
01:16:15,678 --> 01:16:18,547
I am not a monster.

1593
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:20,115
I'm a kraken.

1594
01:16:28,257 --> 01:16:31,093
Mom, we need to shoot
the Trident together.

1595
01:16:31,126 --> 01:16:32,795
No, it-it can't be destroyed.

1596
01:16:32,828 --> 01:16:34,363
That's... that's why I hid it.

1597
01:16:34,396 --> 01:16:37,233
We can do it if we join together
at the same time.

1598
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:40,035
It's the exponential
growth formula.

1599
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:42,605
We've got to shoot it more
and longer.

1600
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:44,507
Trust me, I'm a mathlete.

1601
01:16:56,585 --> 01:16:58,621
It doesn't have to end
like this.

1602
01:16:58,654 --> 01:17:00,789
Just give up the Trident.

1603
01:17:00,823 --> 01:17:03,526
You'll never get this
away from me.

1604
01:17:03,559 --> 01:17:06,795
Maybe I can't, but we can.

1605
01:17:24,313 --> 01:17:27,550
No!

1606
01:17:40,696 --> 01:17:42,831
Woo-hoo!

1607
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,734
Go, Ruby!

1608
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:50,706
Woo-hoo!

1609
01:17:50,739 --> 01:17:53,809
Now, that's a successful
monster hunt.

1610
01:17:53,842 --> 01:17:55,844
We got us
a little mermaid, Davey!

1611
01:17:55,878 --> 01:17:57,446
Please. Please, please, please.

1612
01:17:57,479 --> 01:17:59,114
I'm not evil.

1613
01:17:59,148 --> 01:18:01,116
I'm just pretty...

1614
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,685
and misunderstood.

1615
01:18:04,553 --> 01:18:06,355
Now, what about the mermaid?

1616
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:09,325
-Everyone likes fried fish.
-No.

1617
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:10,726
Away, rage.

1618
01:18:10,759 --> 01:18:12,628
Teenagers.

1619
01:18:12,661 --> 01:18:14,597
Away, rage.

1620
01:18:15,598 --> 01:18:18,767
Ruby, I'm sorry.

1621
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:20,269
I was wrong.

1622
01:18:20,302 --> 01:18:23,339
I should have trusted you
with the truth,

1623
01:18:23,372 --> 01:18:26,475
and so from now on,
no more lying.

1624
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:29,111
And no more hiding.

1625
01:18:33,248 --> 01:18:36,285
I think you can still make
the last dance.

1626
01:18:42,191 --> 01:18:44,793
Now, let's talk about
her coronation.

1627
01:18:44,827 --> 01:18:46,729
Mom, don't start.

1628
01:18:46,762 --> 01:18:50,299
Fine. A mother knows best.

1629
01:18:51,634 --> 01:18:52,735
Brill's here.

1630
01:18:52,768 --> 01:18:55,371
Mamah! What are you doing here?

1631
01:18:55,404 --> 01:18:56,271
And with Agatha?

1632
01:18:56,305 --> 01:18:57,806
Are-are... are you okay?
Is everyone okay?

1633
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,908
Is Ruby okay?

1634
01:18:58,942 --> 01:19:02,244
It's Brill's time now.

1635
01:19:03,712 --> 01:19:05,414
Oh.

1636
01:19:05,447 --> 01:19:08,851
I've waited 15 years for this.

1637
01:19:08,884 --> 01:19:11,253
Oh, who's crying?

1638
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:15,190
You're crying.

1639
01:19:32,909 --> 01:19:34,743
You're our hero.

1640
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:38,480
I love you so much!

1641
01:19:44,386 --> 01:19:46,722
-Yeah!
-Ruby for prom queen.

1642
01:19:46,755 --> 01:19:48,290
You really saved us.

1643
01:19:48,323 --> 01:19:50,893
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
everything sooner,

1644
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:52,795
and I'm sorry for ditching you.

1645
01:19:52,828 --> 01:19:54,396
I shouldn't have lied to you.

1646
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:57,900
Ruby, my sweet, magnificent,
giant-sized best friend,

1647
01:19:57,934 --> 01:20:00,569
you never ever have to hide
things from us.

1648
01:20:00,602 --> 01:20:02,972
Yeah, we will always
be by your side,

1649
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:06,308
even when you almost
ended life as we know it.

1650
01:20:06,341 --> 01:20:07,843
Sorry, no catastrophizing.

1651
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:11,513
Kraken, Canadian or otherwise,
we'll always love you, Rubes.

1652
01:20:12,514 --> 01:20:13,816
Squad solidarity?

1653
01:20:13,849 --> 01:20:15,784
Squad solidarity.

1654
01:20:22,524 --> 01:20:23,993
Hey, you.

1655
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,395
Ruby. H-Hey.

1656
01:20:26,428 --> 01:20:28,630
So, that was you out there?

1657
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:30,466
Guilty.

1658
01:20:30,499 --> 01:20:32,601
-Connor...
-Ruby... Oh, you go.

1659
01:20:32,634 --> 01:20:33,902
No, you go.

1660
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:36,005
Okay, I go.

1661
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,374
Connor, will you go
to prom with me?

1662
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:48,517
Wait. Connor, are these
quadratic derivative graphs?

1663
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,453
Let's just say
I had a good tutor.

1664
01:20:53,655 --> 01:20:56,025
Whoa.

1665
01:20:56,059 --> 01:20:57,493
