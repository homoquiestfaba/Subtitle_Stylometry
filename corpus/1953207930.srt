at a talent show/audition.

17
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:40,172
I remember I had my cross colors on.

18
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,807
I had this huge yellow shirt.

19
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,844
It was like 17 sizes too big,
with some green pants

20
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,382
and my entire set
was about roaches, uh,

21
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,684
Michael Jackson, and bad breath.

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,686
Why is it that people with bad breath

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,955
always got so much to say?

24
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,424
[Laughter]

25
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,460
I was a little nervous,
but I left out of there

26
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,629
with a standing ovation,
and from that moment,

27
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,364
I was like, this is what
I want to do with my life.

28
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,132
By the time I was 15 years old,

29
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,785
I was a professional comic.

30
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,487
So I'm 30 years old

31
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,374
and I'm doing my first
stand-Up comedy special.

32
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,775

what's the one thing

34
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,263
that I haven't gotten a chance to do

35
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:22,598
in the world of entertainment?

36
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:24,266
And it's my stand-up special.

37
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,702
It's really getting out there
and letting people know

38
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:28,937
that I'm a comic at heart.

39
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:32,925

I used to do stand-up,

being on the road,

Nah, no, homo is like a term we use

152
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,049
in the Hip-Hop community,
'cause, you know,

153
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,268
we can be a little homophobic
at times in Hip-Hop.

154
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,955
So, "no homo" is like
a "get out of gay free" card.

156
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,342
It allows two heterosexual men

00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,710

00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,679
without their being any confusion.

159
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,447
I could be like, "hey, Todd, man,

160
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,283
"I really like how that shirt
looks on you.

161
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,401
No homo."

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,735

163
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,237

164
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,239

Exactly.

165
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,676
But then there's just some stuff
that "no homo" don't work on.

166
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,743
You know what I mean?

167
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,845

00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,113
Look at
the old-school player.

183
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,632
"No, you ain't married
to no damn Mariah Carey."

184
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,067
[Laughter]

185
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,202
"I be a monkey's uncle

186
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,838
if you married
to Mariah Carey."

187
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,890
That's for real.
People still don't believe it.

188
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,858
<i>"Hell, nah.
Little boy from drumline?</i>

189
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,344
Hell, nah, man."

190
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,346
I tell ya, I can't blame
y'all though, man,

191
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,182
'cause I probably wouldn't
believe it either

192
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,668
if it wasn't me.

193
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:29,271
Oh, for real, 'cause that's...
That's kind of hard to believe

194
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,073
when you think about it,
you know what I mean?

195
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,641
That's like somebody coming up to me

196
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:33,809
and being like, "hey, man, you heard

197
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,477
Halle Berry married
Soulja boy?"

198
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,312
[Laughter]

199
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:39,314
Yeah, this nigga, man.
Him. This...

200
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:43,785
[Laughter]

201
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,637
And the thing about being married

202
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,206
to one of the most famous
people in the world,

203
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,442
it's beautiful,
but people just feel like

204
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,211
they can come up to me and say
whatever they want to say

205
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,114
about my wife to my face.

206
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,650
"Man, oh, shoot,
you married to Mariah?

207
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,870
Shoot, you don't know
what to do with all that."

208
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:04,322
[Laughter]

209
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,374
"Dude, if it was me, I'd have Mariah

210
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,027
hitting high notes
every night."

211
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,162
[Laughter]

212
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,947
"Like, dang, dad."

213
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,783
[Laughter]

214
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,619
"Separating y'all
at the family reunion."

215
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,338
[Laughter]

216
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,840
It's beautiful, though, man.

217
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,242
And it never cease to fail,
every day, though,

218
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,978
I get the exact same question.

219
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:31,633
Be like, "how in the world
did you get Mariah Carey?"

220
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,984
Nigga, I don't know.

221
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,803
[Laughter]

222
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,139
I don't.

223
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:38,390
It's like my life turned out

224
00:07:38,441 --> 00:07:42,010
like a really good game of mine.

225
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,512
Y'all remember mine,

226
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,815
the little junior high school
notebook paper game?

227
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,818
Remember mansion,
apartment, shack, house?

228
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:53,822
Then you do the little thing
in the middle with the paper.

229
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,874
Yeah, you know what
I'm talking about.

230
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,093
Then you had to, like,
pick, like, you know,

231
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,761
the cars that you wanted,

232
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,062
the four cars when you grew up.

233
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:02,931
You start off all aspirational.

234
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:06,968
Lamborghini, Ferrari.

235
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:11,756
Then you got your little more
realistic Nissan Sentra.

236
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:13,875
Yearlong bus pass.

237
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,277
[Laughter]

238
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,612
And then you have to pick
the four fantasy people

239
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,015
you want to marry when you grow up.

240
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:23,518
Number one on my list, Mariah Carey.

241
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,187
[Cheering]

242
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:26,771
I won.

243
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:29,107
[Laughter]

244
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,876
But then you had to have backups too.

245
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,077
Remember that?

246
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,545
You know, you had to have backups

247
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,781
so, you know, my second one
was Tyra Banks.

248
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:39,234
Oh, yeah, I was into that,
big forehead and all.

249
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,204
<i>Just, America's next top forehead.</i>

250
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,372
I was...

251
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:47,959
And then number three, Rudy Huxtable.

252
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,227
[Laughter]

253
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,445
Oh, yeah, shoot, in the '80s,

254
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,579
I know I ain't the only one.

255
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,797
She'd be sittin' on Bill's lap,

256
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,299
I'd be fantasizing like I was bill.

257
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,051
[Imitating Bill Cosby]
like, "oh, Rudy."

258
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,269
[Laughter]

259
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,137
"Come give me a Zerbert."

260
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,507
[Laughter]

261
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,828
And then number four
was Rosie O'Donnell.

262
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:09,764
[Laughter]

263
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,166
No homo.

264
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,001
[Laughter]

265
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:17,072
Nah, honestly,
I honestly have to say,

266
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:20,175
my wedding day was
the happiest day of my life.

267
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,577
[Cheers and applause]

268
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:25,180
'Cause that's the day that I came up!

269
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,631
Cha-Ching!

270
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,167
[Laughter]

271
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,235
We gonna keep it real tonight.

272
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,903
Mariah got me.

273
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,104
[Laughter]

274
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,006
We are recession-proof.

275
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,658
[Laughter]

276
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:37,642
Shoot.

277

I'm tellin' you,
keepin' it real tonight.

280
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,923
I know y'all were shocked on that day

281
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,991
y'all heard about it.

282
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,293
Shoot, I was shocked.

283
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,313
Shoot, I was walkin'
down the aisle, shocked.

284
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,484
[Laughter]

285
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,987
About to have sex with Mariah Carey!

Wet dreams do come true.

[Laughter]

291
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,084
That day was an amazing day, y'all.

292
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,385
I loved my wedding day.

293
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,787
The only thing
is that we weren't able

294
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,990
to invite everybody
that we wanted to invite,

295
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,625
'cause it just happened so fast

296
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,827
and, you know, we got
so many friends and family.

297
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,595
And, you know, like,
my friends and family,

298
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,330
some of 'em just don't
know how to act.

299
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,000
Can't take 'em nowhere.
You know the type.

300
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:39,287
Like, I wanted to invite
my friend kanye West.

301
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,956
[Laughter]

302
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:45,193
'Cause you never know what
Kanye gonna do, right?

303
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,295
Kanye would probably
show up to the wedding

304
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,180
in a glow-in-the-dark
Teddy bear costume

305
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,200
with some video hos.

306
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,952
Kanye would probably jump on stage,

307
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,754
right in the middle
of the ceremony, right?

308
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,356
Like, "hey, yo, friend!"

309
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,960

"Hey, yo, Nick,
I'm really happy for you!

"And I'm gonna let you finish!

313
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,607
"But Jay and Beyonce
had the greatest wedding

314
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,442
of all time!"

315

you broke, nigga!"

Man.
It's beautiful, though.

323
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,699
People are finally starting
to embrace our marriage now,

324
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,734
so it's cool, you know,
'cause for the longest,

325
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,586
<i>They thought this was the
longest episode of punk'd ever.</i>

326
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,921
[Laughter]

327
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,091
Like, when is ashton coming out?

328
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,044
Nah, but because, you know,
my wife is pregnant with twins,

329
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,181
so we getting all type
of congratulations and stuff.

330
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,249
Yeah!

331
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,385
Everybody congratulating us, man.

332
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,187
See, y'all know it just...

333
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,022
Just caught me
all the way off-Guard.

334
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,557
I had no idea.

335
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,960
Denzel washington came
and hollered at me.

336
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,261
Yeah!

337
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,581
I didn't even know Denzel
knew who the hell I was.

338
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:16,785
It was kind of strange too,
because Denzel came up to me

339
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,503
and tried to give me marital advice

340
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:20,622
in the middle of a nightclub.

341
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,457
But you kinda got to listen

342
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,926
'cause it's Denzel Washington, right?

343
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,461
And he came up to me smooth.

344
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,062
Like, you know,
straight out of a movie.

345
00:12:28,097 --> 00:12:30,064
Just like...

346
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,099

I'm telling you, black folks,
we need to do something.

I don't know. It's kind of
confusing to me.

'Cause when you think about it,

443

They is, but I figured it out.

448

I figured it out.
I know what it is.

449
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,350

know how to have meetings.

It's crazy how I knew that, right?

472
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,702
But we gotta learn from
the white folks, y'all.

473
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,071
They organized. They know
how to have meetings.

474

Black folks, we show up
late for everything.

475

Shoot, even think
about the government.

That's just one big meeting.
That's all that is.

Congress?
A big meeting.

482
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,841
That's probably how they got us
over here in the first place.

483
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,361
Oh, yeah, black folks,
we was probably over in Africa

Yo, y'all know black folks.

538
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,102
Shoot, they gave us the scraps.

539
00:19:48,136 --> 00:19:49,170
Y'all remember.

540
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,605
But we just put a little
seasoning on it.

541
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,773
We know how to make something
out of nothin', right?

542
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,308
[Cheers and applause]

543
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,394
That's what it was.
Shoot.

544
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,396
They gave us pig intestines,

545
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,632
and we made it taste like da shit.

546
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,767
[Laughter]

547
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,001
That's how they got they name.

548
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,921
Chitlins.

549
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:11,826
"Them the chitlins
right there, girl."

550
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,828
Yeah, even breakfast food.

551
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,830
They gave us grain.

552
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:19,500
We made grits.
Yeah!

553
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:21,219
Shoot, you know,
that's exactly right.

554
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,221
White people capitalized off of that.

555
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,723
Probably early one sunday morning,

556
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,009
Master was walking past the cabin.

557
00:20:28,043 --> 00:20:29,827
[Laughter]

558
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,063
[Sniffing]

559
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,598
"Meeting!"

560
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,800
[Laughter]

561
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,934
"I don't know what in the world

562
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,286
"aunt Jemima's in there cooking,

563
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,954
but we need to box it!"

564
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,273
[Laughter]

565
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,677
"While we're at it, uh,
grab her uncle too, Ben.

566
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,746
He's amazing
with the rice."

567
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,966
[Laughter]

568
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,435
Oh, yeah, we need to have
some meetings, man.

569
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,237
Matter of fact, we're gonna
have a meeting here tonight.

570
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,539
It's gonna be the first meeting,
black folks, all right?

571
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,992
[Cheers and applause]

572
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,476
White people, y'all invited.

573
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,029
Just keep quiet.

574
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,481
We do, man, just 'cause I don't
like to get too deep,

575
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,350
but this is a true statistic
right here, y'all.

576
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,153
In 1865, when slavery was abolished,

577
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,023
black people were less than 1%
of this nation's wealth.

578
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:21,562
Today, in 2011,
black people are less than 1%

579
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,764
of this nation's wealth.

580
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:27,267
We need to have a damn meeting!

581
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,836
We do!

582
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,471
Seems to me they try
to fool us, though.

583
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,506
They try to fool us
with the little Oprahs

584
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,942
and, you know, the jay-Zs,
Michael Jordan.

585
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:37,111
Think we got paper?
Mm-Mm. Shoot.

586
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:39,847
For every oprah, there's
two million broke-Ohs...

587
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,749
[Laughter]

588
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,151
Eating okra.

589
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:45,886
[Laughter]

590
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,971
We're gonna have some meetings.

591
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,973
Even reparations.

592
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,241
Who signed up for that?

593
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,575
Who negotiated that?

594
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,177
We didn't get it.

595
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,314
With the big 40 acres and a mule.

596
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,848
I can't put no rims on a mule.

597
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,351
What does...

598
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,969
I wish they would have did us

599
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,704
like they did the indians.

600
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,807
You know, give me some casinos.

601
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,125
Keep the 40 acres.

602
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:10,961
Shoot, you imagine if
black folks had a casino?

603
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,881
It'd be called canegroes.

604
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,199
[Laughter]

605
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,584
The only games black people
know how to play?

606
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,586
- Spades.
- Spades.

607
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,038
[Cheers and applause]

608
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,807
Dominoes.

609
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,443
Bid whist, Tonk.

610
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,579
Red light, green light.
Red light, green light.

611
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,248
[Laughter]

612
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,384
Pit bull fights.

613
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:34,919
[Laughter]

614
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,587
'Cause, you know,
the indians did it right.

615
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,322
They got they casinos
and they named them

616
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,392
after all of them
beautiful indian names.

617
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,762
You know what I'm saying?
Like Borgata, the Aztec.

618
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,598
Black people, we'd have to
do the same thing.

619
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,950
"Hey, dog, I'm about to go down
to the Shaniqua."

620
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:51,285
[Laughter]

621
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,521
Shit, I hear they got
All-You-Can-Eat sunflower seeds

622
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,139
down at the Taj Jamal.

623
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:59,093
[Laughter]

624
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,945
Probably wouldn't even have
no air conditioning

625
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,947
up in there, right?

626
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,132
Just be a bunch of old ladies
passing out church fans.

627
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:10,137
"Just play the game.
Just play the game."

628
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:11,522
Probably wouldn't even have...

629
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:13,441
Wouldn't even have no slot machines.

630
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,709
Just be a bunch of crackheads
lined up next to each other,

631
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:18,696
talking about, "pick a hand,
dog, pick a hand."

632
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,730
[Laughter]

633
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,856
Gotta get our money right, y'all.

634
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,024
We do.

635
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,492
Have some type of meetings
or something.

636
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:34,061
That's why I don't let
none of this go to my head.

637
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,797
None of this fame and money
and stuff like that.

638
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,798
Uh-Uh.

639
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,933
I was taught to, you know,

640
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,901
always stay grounded
and keep god first,

641
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,302
You know what I'm saying?

642
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,588
Never change the way you were raised.

643
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:45,589
[Applause]

644
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,757
That's real talk, y'all.

645
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:49,026
That's why I had the same
broke mentality

646
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,694
that I grew up with, for real.

647
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,763
I called it "hood habits."

648
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,498
That's right.
Say it with me, y'all.

649
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,901
All: hood habits.

650
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,838
Tammy, you didn't say it.

651
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,973
[Laughter]

652
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,326
Tammy, I know it's probably
a little confusing.

653
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,778
Hood habits.
Let me translate it for you.

654
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,547
Trailer park tendencies.

655
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,015
[Laughter]

656
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,284
Now you know what I'm talking
about, right, Tammy?

657
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:17,354
Give me some.
Here all night, baby.

658
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,790
'Cause it's the same thing.

659
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,026
Hood habits, trailer park tendencies.

660
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,694
Same thing.
I still do the same stuff.

661
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:24,829
It don't matter.

662
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,765
I still be putting batteries
in the freezer.

663
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,066
[Laughter]

664
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,852
It make the remote
work longer, right?

665
00:24:31,886 --> 00:24:33,938
Hood habits.

666
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:35,940
Shoot, if I walk past a pay phone,

667
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,658
clank, clank, clank, clank,
I'm checking.

668
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:39,693
[Laughter]

669
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:44,215
You never know when you might
need an extra 35 cents.

670
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,583
It's real talk.

671
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,986
Shoot, I still be sneakin' food
into the movie theatre.

672
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,120
[Cheers and applause]

673
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,772
You know?

674
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,207
Yeah, I'll show up
to movie premieres,

675
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,608
I'll be in there popping soda cans.

676
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:55,676
Spish!

677
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,761
[Laughter]

678
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:00,214
Was that a soda can?

679
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,215
[Laughter]

680
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,883
My wife, she's classy.

681
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,618
She's trying to help me through
all of this, man.

682
00:25:04,653 --> 00:25:07,888
She takes me to all of these
fancy restaurants.

683
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,925
Hate them foo-Foo,
chi-Chi ass restaurants.

684
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,793
For real, 'cause I can't
order nothin'

685
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:15,963
off the damn menu without
having to use a rosetta stone.

686
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,231
[Laughter]

687
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,632
It is, it's embarrassing.

688
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,000
I can't pronounce none of that stuff.

689
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,436
Even the desserts is hard to say.

690
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,806
A dessert to me is
a good piece of wonder bread

691
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,942
with some cinnamon and some sugar

692
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,477
and some butter on that bad boy.

693
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:34,448
And you put it in that thing
up under the oven,

694
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:37,051
that's a dessert!

695
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:39,920
Shoot, you call that
cinnamon nigga-Crunch.

696
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,255
[Laughter]

697
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,524
Ooh, I love
cinnamon nigga-Crunch.

698
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:44,775
[Laughter]

699
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:45,793
I'm telling you, man.

700
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,228
I don't know if this is
a hood habit or not,

701
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,696
but it's something that I've noticed

702
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,863
since I've been married.

703
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:53,200
Women, y'all have a lot of products.

704
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,852
Oh, man, what, y'all, ladies,

705
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,337
y'all got all the products?

706
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:57,338
[Cheers and applause]

707
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,606
Damn, my wife, shoot.

708
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,075
Her bathroom wall
just look like rite-Aid.

709
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,343
[Laughter]

710
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:04,261
She be putting on all
these creams at night,

711
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,312
before we go to bed,

712
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,081
like we about to box or something.

713
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:08,182
[Laughter]

714
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,017
I just be grabbing stuff
and squeezing it.

715
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:11,885
I don't care.

716
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,153
Picked up this stuff the other day.

717
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:14,288
This stuff was amazing.

718
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,489
Y'all might have heard of this stuff.

719
00:26:15,523 --> 00:26:17,824
Uh, conditioner?

720
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,209
[Laughter]

721
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,961
No, for real.
I asked my wife.

722
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:22,363
She's like, "yeah, baby,
that's conditioner.

723
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:23,597
"You could use that.

724
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:25,516
"That's for the coarse areas
of your hair.

725
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,185
You put it on there
and it makes it softer."

726
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,219
[Laughter]

727
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,445
[Cheering]

728
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,315
So I put it on
the coarsest hair that I got.

729
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,617
[Laughter]

730
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:46,754
And let me tell you, let me tell you!

731
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:49,490
My man bush is silky smooth.

732
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,091
[Laughter]

733
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,426
[Cheering]

734
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,396
Oh, yeah, I got good hair
down there now, y'all.

735
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,831
Oh, yeah. I'm light-Skinned
down there, too.

736
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,733
Matter of fact, I even put
a part in the middle.

737
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,535
Just...

738
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,204
Looked like louis farrakhan
down there.

739
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:06,206
"My brother,
my brother."

740
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:10,194
[Laughter]

741
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,496
'Cause we didn't grow up
with no conditioner

742
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,499
and shampoo and all of
that stuff, did we?

743
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,135
We wanted to wash our hair,
what would we use?

744
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,104
- Soap.
- Dishwashing soap!

745
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,271
[Laughter]

746
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,673
Shoot, dishwashing liquid

747
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,876
was a multi-Purpose product
in my household, y'all.

748
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,397
Shoot, you'd use it
as shampoo, bubble bath...

749
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,582
[Laughter]

750
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,801
Car wash.

751
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,169
Mouthwash.

752
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:37,571
You'd go to school smelling
like lemon and plates.

753
00:27:37,605 --> 00:27:41,141
[Laughter]

754
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:42,526
I make fun of my mom,

755
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,695
but she did the best
with what she had.

756
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,863
[Woman cheers]

757
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,581
Man, don't scream for that.

758
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:51,035
That just means she cheap as hell.

759
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,586
She is. I know I ain't
the only one.

760
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,721
Y'all have some cheap moms?

761
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,239
Clap if you have some cheap moms.

762
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,507
[Cheers and applause]

763
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,342
Okay, I know I ain't
the only one in here.

764
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:02,346
Tammy and Todd, you guys
are not clapping.

765
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,266
"Like, we have no idea what
you're talking about, negro."

766
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,435
[Laughter]

767
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,271
"We have mutual funds."

768
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:14,141
[Laughter]

769
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:16,527
I tell you as I see, that's
probably 'cause y'all grew up

770
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,512
with all type of luxuries
and stuff, right?

771
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,447
- For real?
- No.

772
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,616
No, you say no, but I bet you
your definition of a luxury

773
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,251
is different from mine.

774
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,953
Like, you guys probably had luxuries,

775
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:27,955
like milk.

776
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,189
[Laughter]

777
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,875
Right? You had milk
in your cereal, right?

778
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,877
Yeah. Now, what'd we have?

779
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,281
- Water.
- Water.

780
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,200
See, and you probably had all
them fancy cereals and stuff.

781
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,770
Cereals with the famous
characters on it.

782
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,705
They had slogans
and commercials and stuff.

783
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,041
Shoot, my mom bought cereal
with characters on it

784
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,427
ain't nobody ever heard of.

785
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,212
They were just bootleg characters.

786
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,465
Like, what are some of
the cereal characters

787
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,933
that y'all grew up with?

788
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,067
[Audience shouting]

789
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,936
Cap'n crunch.

790
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,405
Not me.
I had sergeant soggy.

791
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,906
[Laughter]

792
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,843
Just ol' discharged from the army.

793
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,611
Lost one arm in vietnam.

794
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,581
Crunch berries falling
all out of his pockets.

795
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,099
[Laughter]

796
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,467
What's some other ones?

797
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,534
[Audience shouting]

798
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,086
Tony the tiger?

799
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:20,207
Shoot, I had tyrone the tiger.

800
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,976
And you know, tony the tiger
was real enthusiastic

801
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,977
about his job.

802
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,095
He was happy to go to work

803
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,214
at the frosted flakes
commercial, right?

804
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,315
He'd come out there and be like,

805
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,684
"they're grrrreat!"

806
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:33,787
Tyrone was like,
"nigga, they a'ight."

807
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,457
[Laughter]

808
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:38,659
"Grrr nigrrr."

809
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,194
[Laughter]

810
00:29:40,228 --> 00:29:43,130
I'd rather have me some grrrits.

811
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:44,715
[Laughter]

812
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,217
For real, just cheap
for no reason, man.

813
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,552
Mom bought me...

814
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,822
And she would never, like,
buy me toys that I wanted.

815
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,358
It was always, like,
the bootleg version of the toy.

816
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,794
'Cause my mother used to
travel far and wide

817
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,462
for a bargain.

818
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,130
This is true.
This is no joke.

819
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,999
We lived in san diego,
so my mother used to go

820
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,869
all the way down to Mexico
to buy my toys.

821
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,154
[Cheers and applause]

822
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,573
Don't clap for that.

823
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:12,209
For real, just... And man,
I didn't find out

824
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,829
till one day she bought me
a see n say.

825
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:17,631
Y'all remember the see n says?

826
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:20,167
In the '80s,
that was the toy to have.

827
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:23,353
It was educational.
It was blue or red.

828
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,090
I was so excited when
she got home from tijuana.

829
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,592
Oh, I was, man.

830
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,162
Shoot, I grabbed that thing,
took it out of the box,

831
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,864
pulled the string.

832
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,166
It started spinning
and it landed on a cow.

833
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,935
<i>That thing said, "la vaca."</i>

834
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:39,052
[Laughter]

835
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,856
<i>"La vaca dice, 'moo, moo.'"</i>

836
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,890
[Laughter]

837
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:55,235
I was going to the zoo,
confused as hell.

838
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,970
Like, "that ain't no cow.

839
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,273
<i>"That's a la vaca.</i>

840
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,242
<i>Dice, 'moo.' Let's go."</i>

841
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,961
[Laughter]

842
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,212
Yeah, I know, I know.
Shut up.

843
00:31:05,246 --> 00:31:07,281
There was cows in the zoo
in my neighborhood.

844
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:08,982
[Laughter]

845
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,201
It was a tough neighborhood.
Cows and pit bulls.

846
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,736
It was tough.

847
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,338
[Laughter]

848
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,440
I make fun of my mom, but honestly,

849
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,141
I wouldn't be standing
on this stage tonight

850
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,228
if it wasn't for the sacrifices
that my mother made, so...

851
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:22,896
[Cheers and applause]

852
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:24,064
She worked hard.

853
00:31:24,098 --> 00:31:26,333
She had me while she
was still in school.

854
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:28,435
Worked several jobs while raising me,

855
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,803
and I know it was hard
raising me too,

856
00:31:29,837 --> 00:31:30,871
'cause I was bad, y'all.

857
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:32,973
I was a bad kid.
Real bad, shoot.

858
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:36,243
Second grade, they diagnosed me
with a.D.D.

859
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:39,746
A.D.H.D. Shoot,
I was the high-Def version.

860
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:42,199
[Laughter]

861
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,751
[Laughs] for real, I was bad, y'all.

862
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,319
I was just bad for no reason.

863
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,005
Like, if you guys were
ever bad in school

864
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,957
and then your mom,
like, threatened you to, like,

865
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,025
"I'll come up off my job
and come up there

866
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,343
"and embarrass you
in front of your kids.

867
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,461
"Don't make me come from my job

868
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,796
and come up
at that school."

869
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,180
Shoot, my mom was so young,

870
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,099
she used to come from
her school to beat me.

871
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,801
[Laughter]

872
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,454
"I got P.E. Next period!

873
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,057
Messing up
both our educations."

874
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,492
[Laughter]

875
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,261
Principal come over there,
send us both to detention.

876
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,196
[Laughter]

877
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,015
"Your fault, mama."

878
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,067
[Laughter]

879
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,853
"Quit bullshitting
and pass me a lunchable."

880
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,489
[Laughter]

881
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,559
It's true, though, man,
and I actually have

882
00:32:25,593 --> 00:32:27,961
so much more respect and admiration

883
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,296
and appreciation for my mom.

884
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,098
Now that I'm getting ready
to become a father,

885
00:32:31,132 --> 00:32:33,400
'cause just thinking about
all the emotions

886
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:37,070
and the mental things you have
to go through with that, man.

887
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:38,372
'Cause I ain't gonna lie
to y'all, man.

888
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:42,643
I am horrified. Scared,
y'all, of being a father.

889
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:43,810
And it probably ain't even a reason

890
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:45,646
why y'all think I should be scared.

891
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,265
I'm scared that...
I hope they don't get

892
00:32:48,316 --> 00:32:51,568
that badass gene that run
through my family.

893
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,655
Nah, 'cause all the kids
in my family are bad.

894
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:55,989
Just bad for no reason.

895
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,758
Y'all got bad kids in y'all family?

896
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,359
[Cheers and applause]

897
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,561
Oh, okay, I was checking, too,

898
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:01,762
you know, 'cause that mean y'all got

899
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:03,130
some badass kids at home right now,

900
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:04,497
then you don't even
care if they are there

901
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,400
when you get back type bad.

902
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:08,335
Like, "I was at the comedy show,

903
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,437
and Jesus just took him
in his sleep."

904
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:12,939
[Laughter]

905
00:33:12,974 --> 00:33:16,076
I'm telling you, y'all,
just bad for no reason.

906
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,178
You ever meet them kids so bad
that you want to just give 'em

907
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,280
nothing but bad advice?

908
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:23,417
Like, "strangers got
the best candy."

909
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:26,887
[Laughter]

910
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,290
"Why don't you go play hopscotch
on the freeways?

911
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:34,194
Good for your agility."

912
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:37,748
It's no joke, y'all, because
I got a four-Year-Old niece,

913
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,201
She is the devil reincarnated.

914
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:43,253
Her name is Juicy.

915
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,254
[Audience ohs]

916
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,455
Yeah, exactly.

917
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:47,624
Just destined for
the stripper pole, right?

918
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:49,259
[Laughter]

919
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,061
What else you gonna be
with a name like Juicy?

920
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:54,331
It ain't gonna be
congresswoman Juicy.

921
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,466
Gonna be coming to the stage,

922
00:33:56,517 --> 00:33:59,136
doing something strange
for some change,

923
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,856
Juicy!

924
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,324
And see, the first problem is,

925
00:34:04,358 --> 00:34:06,793
her mama named her Juicica.

926
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:09,196
Yeah, that's horrible.
We'll come back to that later.

927
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,697
That's...

928
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,467
But see, she don't want you to
call her by her full name.

929
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,969
You'll be like, "hey, Juicica,
how you doin'?"

930
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:20,407
"My name is Juicy!

931
00:34:20,441 --> 00:34:22,976
It just come out your mouth
so loosely."

932
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,579
It's like, "you only four years old!

933
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:28,365
"Why you got little slut rhymes?

934
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,217
At four?"

935
00:34:30,251 --> 00:34:31,752
Oh, y'all should see her, too.

936
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:32,803
Yo, I can't stand her.

937
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,337
She's still wearing a diaper,

938
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:35,622
just bowlegged
and pigeon-Toed,

939
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,924
all at the same time.

940
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:40,327
Just hair pulled up
in little plastic barrettes,

941
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:43,330
just hear her coming,
just crsk-Crsk-Crsk-Crsk.

942
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:46,266
Crsk-Crsk-Crsk.
Sound like a ghetto rattlesnake.

943
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,136
Just crsk-Crsk,
crsk-Crsk-Crsk.

944
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,703
[Laughter]

945
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,055
'Cause you can't even
take her nowhere.

946
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:54,340
Can't take her out in public

947
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,577
'cause her little inner-Stripper
want to come out.

948
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,579
Y'all know the type of kids
I'm talking about?

949
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:01,681
Little kids that just like to
get naked for no reason

950
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:04,684
and be all in
the grocery store, just...

951
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,387
just naked all around the produce?

952
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:10,640
Like, what is up?
I don't understand that.

953
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:15,011
Like, we tried to take Juicy
to church last easter.

954
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:17,013
Oh, and you black folks, you know

955
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,317
when we go to church on easter,
we go to church.

956
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,220
You know, we go get new outfits.

957
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,056
You know what I'm saying?
Get your hair done.

958
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,924
You know, the little kids be onstage,

959
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,926
doing they Easter speech.

960
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,212
Here come Juicy.

961
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,981
Crsk-Crsk-Crsk-Crsk.

962
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:37,217
Crsk-Crsk-Crsk.

963
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,886
And I gotta give it to her,
'cause she started off great.

964
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,671
She came out there in her
cute little pink dress.

965
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,240
She was like...

966
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,059
[Laughter]

967
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,930
"Jesus is the reason
for the season."

968
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:51,464
[Laughter]

969
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:53,033
"♪ Ain't your mama pretty ♪

970
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,503
[Singing indistinctly]

971
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:58,271
♪ Ain't your mama pretty? ♪"

972
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,540
"Get your bad ass
off the stage, Juicy!"

973
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,676
[Laughter]

974
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,711
Deacons was trying to tip her.

975
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,882
[Laughter]

976
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,402
Get the dollar out of
the diaper. She's only four.

977
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,404
[Laughs]

978
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:18,208
I know. Why's she still
wearing a diaper?

979
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,910
That is a shame.

980
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:23,413
Man, I hope my kids don't
hang around Juicy.

981
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,049
They will not be allowed,
I'll tell you.

982
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,817
[Laughter]

983
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,319
I want to be a great father,

984
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,722
'cause I got some good male
role models in my life.

985
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,192
Even the bad ones are good.

986
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,760
For real, like my grandfather.

987
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,595
I wish I could introduce
y'all to my grandfather.

988
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:42,616
Ooh, he is
a 75-Year-Old thug.

989
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,951
Just real bent to the
penitentiary and everything.

990
00:36:44,986 --> 00:36:47,254
He's got that penitentiary
swole still.

991
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,056
It look like he poppin'
viagra and steroids

992
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:51,591
all at the same time.

993
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,426
Just big for no reason.

994
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,996
One of them old-School players
from down south.

995
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,148
Always got his hand in his pocket.

996
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,650
You don't know if he gonna pull
out a peppermint or a pistol.

997
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:01,685
[Laughter]

998
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,320
Just... Just gangsta.

999
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,521
And you know what?

1000
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,722
He don't care about my money,

1001
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,090
he don't care about fame,
none of that.

1002
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,892
He can't stand me, y'all.

1003
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,145
'Cause I ain't gangster enough
to be his grandson.

1004
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,380
He'll tell you, too.

1005
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:15,198
He'll be like, "oh, shoot,
shoot, nuh-Uh.

1006
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,816
"What, dude, uh, Nick Cannon?

She was mixing my red bandanas
in with the whites.

1125
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:58,398
I was showing up to school
in pink khakis, boy.

1126
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:02,468
They thought I was gangbanging
for breast cancer awareness.

1127
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:04,504

I did.

1134
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:19,185

[Laughter]

1136
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:22,088
I don't know if y'all
know this or not,

1137
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,890
But, like, mexican gang members,

1138
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:27,093
the harder they are,
the slower they walk.

1139
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,595
You ever notice that?

1140
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:33,099
[Laughter]

1141
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,400

'cause he wasn't going nowhere.

1147
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,212
He was like a statue.

1148
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,413
[Laughter]

1149
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:49,082

00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,165
That's what you supposed to do, baby.

1408
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,433
That's what jokes are all about.

1409
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:37,769
We too uptight in society
right now, y'all.

1410
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,605
We are.
We gotta loosen up.

1411
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:41,273
We gotta laugh a little bit.

1412
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,309
Matter of fact, with, like,
the whole "n" word thing.

1413
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:46,078
- Are we over that yet?
- No.

1414
00:52:46,112 --> 00:52:47,179
White people are like, "yeah,"

1415
00:52:47,213 --> 00:52:48,614
and the niggas are like,
"hell nah."

1416
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,217
[Laughter]

1417
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,221
"Shoot, I'm still looking for
mel gibson's ass.

1418
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,624
<i>Got rid of all
my lethal weapon tapes."</i>

1419
00:52:58,658 --> 00:53:00,359
Come on, y'all, it's 2011.

1420
00:53:00,393 --> 00:53:02,962
Can we get over this racism stuff?

1421
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:03,963
[Cheers and applause]

1422
00:53:03,997 --> 00:53:05,564
Please!

1423
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,300
We should end it.

1424
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:08,984
Matter of fact, we could
end it right here tonight.

1425
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,019
It would be historical.

1426
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,820
Y'all want to end racism tonight?

1427
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,489
[Cheers and applause]

1428
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:16,242
Tammy and Todd.

1429
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,813
[Laughter]

1430
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:22,848
You better answer this shit right.

1431
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:24,950
[Laughter]

1432
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,269
The black people over there
are like, "hey, hey, hey."

1433
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,139
[Laughter]

1434
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,726
Todd, do you want to end racism?

1435
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,894
Absolutely.

1436
00:53:34,928 --> 00:53:37,446
He answered that quick
as hell. "Absolutely.

1437
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,565
[Laughter]

1438
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,767
It's simple, man. It can be
an historic night.

1439
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:45,304
All you gotta do is one thing, Todd.

1440
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,655
Let me have your wife.

1441
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,376
[Laughter]

1442
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,245
He's like,
"go ahead, I'll trade you."

1443
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,148
We'd wife-Swap
like 'em all, right?

1444
00:53:56,182 --> 00:53:57,383
[Laughter]

1445
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:58,717
Nah, I'm jo... I'm playin'.

1446
00:53:58,752 --> 00:54:00,252
In all seriousness, all serious,

1447
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:01,420
you only gotta do one thing, man.

1448
00:54:01,454 --> 00:54:04,423
Stand up, Todd.
Stand up, all right?

1449
00:54:04,457 --> 00:54:05,858
[Cheers and applause]

1450
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:08,294
Give me a hug, Todd.
Come here, man.

1451
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:10,863
[Cheers and applause]

1452
00:54:10,897 --> 00:54:12,031
All right, now,

1453
00:54:12,065 --> 00:54:13,032
Get off me.

1454

[Laughter]

1455
00:54:14,401 --> 00:54:15,935
Y'all give it up for Todd.

1456
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:17,036
[Cheers and applause]

1457
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,538
Todd and tammy for being
such good sports.

1458
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:21,340
[Cheers and applause]

1459
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:22,975
I appreciate y'all.
Really, I do,

1460
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:28,981
because I tried that same joke
last week down south,

1461
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:32,384
And that shit did not work.

1462
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:35,354
Oh, no, man, oh, mm-Mm.
Now, shoot, where was I at?

1463
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:38,207
Uh, shoot-A-Nigger,
tennessee.

1464
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:40,192
[Laughter]

1465
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,544
Shoot-A-Nigger, chattanooga,
something like that.

1466
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,481
It was... It was dangerous.

1467
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,517
So, no, it was very,
it was very dangerous.

1468
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:50,386
And I was working hard too, y'all.

1469
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,488
I was out there,
doing all my impressions.

1470
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,391
Tried to do the hug the white
guy in the audience joke.

1471
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,059
All of a sudden, the lights go out.

1472
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:58,727
Shoooo.

1473
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,646
You know me. I ain't
but a buck 65.

1474
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,031
I jumped in my karate stance.

1475
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:06,302
I was... I was focused.

1476
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:10,139
And all of a sudden,
a dude got up in the background

1477
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,242
and he was like, "hey there,
colored boy up there

1478
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:19,281
<i>"on the stage from
that movie 'drumstick, '</i>

1479
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,568
"we don't think you're funny, boy,

1480
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:24,870

00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:33,112
[Laughter]

1484
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:35,848
"Shoot boy, you look, when
your kind come around here,

1485
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:38,384
"we'll hang 'em out back.

1486
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,187
"But boy, if you can do
an impression of the king,

1487
00:55:42,222 --> 00:55:44,323
"shoot, we'll let you go
and you can have

1488
00:55:44,357 --> 00:55:47,292
all the watermelon
and barbecue you want to."

1489
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:48,410
[Laughter]

1490
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:49,728
I was like, "the king?
I can do the king.

1491
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,963
The king is easy."

1492
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:54,366
He was like, "go on, boy,
and do the king."

1493
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:56,368
So I got out there and I said,

1494
00:55:56,403 --> 00:56:01,623
"and we'll speed up that day
where all god's children,

I'm like, "Elvis?"

1510
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,011
Man, black people don't do Elvis.

1511
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,997
So I'm grabbin' all my stuff,
trying to keep my dignity,

getting ready to leave,

1513
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,733
all of a sudden I hear
some doors lock,
