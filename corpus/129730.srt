Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,399
I'm X-ray Cat. I've got super powers.

3
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,837
I can see through wooden doors
with my X-ray vision. Wooden doors.

4
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,195
I can see the criminal on the other side.

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,919
He can't see me, and he's committing crime.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,790
I come along and say "I can see you. He says
"You can't." I say "Yes, I can with my..."

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,836
X-ray...

8
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,911
X-ray Cat.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,959
"You can't get me. You can't get me."
"Yes, I can. Yes, I can."

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,031
"Yes, I can. Yes..."

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,111
The bananas.

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,431
I know a banana who applied for a job
as a telephone repairman.

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,799
Guy came and said "You want a job here?"
And he said "Yeah, I wanna get a job."

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,678
"You got the job!
You got the job, buddy!"

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,351
And then the beavers came. The beaver
started yelling at the other beaver.

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,072
The beaver started yelling at the other beaver.
He said "You stupid beaver!"

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,151
"You stupid..."

I'm so sad you're leaving me.

Why are you moving to Los Angeles
to work in a cheese factory?

40
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,913
I'm not gonna just work in a cheese sandwich
factory. I'm gonna shop my drawings.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,719
- I'm gonna be like Charles Schulz.
- You'll be fine.

- No, I'm gonna be like Charles Schulz.
- That's my boy. Confidence.

You're a big man now.
You've got a job, a goddamn real job, Gord.

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,035

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,433
Mom, stop it. Stop it.
Mom, I'm a 28-year-old man.

51
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,433
Hey, baby. He's a 28-year-old man.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,634
Yeah, I'm a 28-year-old man.

55
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,474
- Son, wait.
- What?

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,552
You're not taking that bus to Los Angeles.

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,838
You bought me a ticket
on this bus to Los Angeles.

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,070
That's not all we bought you.

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,874
Jeez. A convertible.

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,719

That's me. I'm the number one son.

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,638
- What about me, Mom?
- You're number one son, too.

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,678
Then how come
Gord gets a LeBaron and I don't?

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,991
- Cos they love me more than they love you.
- No. No, they don't.

I don't see two LeBarons.

- Where's your LeBaron, Freddy?

71
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
- Boys! Boys!
- How many LeBarons are there? Two?

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,997
Shut up!

73
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,198
Gord, this car is more than a gift.
It's...

74
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,874
It's kind of an investment in you.

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,599

- Oh, my God.

149
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,994

Probably best I tell him.

- I'm...

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,112
I'm Quincy. I'm with the Coroner's Office.
I'm like a police officer.

152
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,760
So I should see Mr. Davidson
cos I'm a police officer.

153
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,035
OK. I...

154
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,071
He'll be at that restaurant.

155
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,272
- He'll be devastated.
- OK...

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,270
God, he loved Linda.

157
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,638
- He did love Linda.
- I know.

158
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,996
I think it's wonderful
when two people love one another, and...

159
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,676
...even though there's a chance one of
those two people will die a horrible death...

160
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,275
...that doesn't make me fear love.
I'm not afraid of love.

161
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,194
Could I be your boyfriend? I love you.

162
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,557
- Get outta here!
- No, no, no. I was just thinking...

163
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,393
A woman is dead. Linda is dead!

164
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,439
I thought we could grieve together
over the dead Linda, over the dead woman.

165
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,112
Fuck off!

166
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,316
You're a skinny loser!

167
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,431
- Someone call Security.
- Don't.

168
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,317
Shit!

169
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,034
- Security!
- Don't call them, OK? I gotta go.

170
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,550
Tell Hanna-Barbera to go fuck themselves.

171
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,918
I got twelve Korean teenagers in a tiger cage
that can draw a fucking dog wearing a cape.

172
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,793
OK. I'm looking for a Mr. Dave Davidson.

173
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,472
- Are you Dave Davidson?
- No.

174
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,391
- David Davidson?
- My name's Peter.

175
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,153
- I'm looking for a David Davidson.
- I'm a woman.

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,832
- Did I ask what sex you are?
- No.

177
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,799
- Did I ask if you were David Davidson?
- My name is Cheryl.

178
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,997
- I'm Dave Davidson. Is there a problem?
- You're Mr. Davidson?

179
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,516
- Yeah, officer. Is there a problem here?
- I'm not really a cop.

180
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,713
My name's Gord, and I want
to show you my drawings.

181
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,439
Your drawings? Are you kidding?

182
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,832
Mr. Davidson, I'm an animator. I've got
this idea I wanna pitch to you. It's a cartoon.

183
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,992
It's a cat with super powers.
It can see through wooden doors.

184
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,039
He solves crimes, he can fly.
My friends and I think it's hilarious.

185
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,350
He flies like this. It's great.

186
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,119
Right, well, I'm glad
your friends enjoy it, OK?

187
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,316
Tell me something, what do you want?

188
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,073
I want you to help me make it
into a TV show.

189
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,073
You just barge into a restaurant
dressed like a fucking English bobby...

190
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,276
...and expect someone to give you a TV show?

191
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,351
Uh, I don't know. Um...

192
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,349
- Yeah.
- Do me a favor? Leave me alone.

193
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,032
- Please, please...
- Valet?

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,351
- Please, just look at my drawings.
- Yeah, OK. Fine.

195
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,352
It's X-ray Cat, but instead of seeing through
everything, he can only see through wood.

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,194
So if there's something on the other side
of a wooden door... See the criminal?

197
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,671
- I see the criminal. I see the door.
- He sees the criminal and saves the day...

198
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,356
...to the dismay of the police cos they hate it
when people take the law into their hands.

199
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,830
- Like a Batman.
- Like a Guardian Angel. What's that called?

200
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,232
- Like a vigilante.
- Like a vigilante! He's like a vigilante...

201
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,311
...uh, cat.

202
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,072
It's a cat who's a vigilante.
A cat who is a vigilante.

203
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,154
I got that, Gord. Listen, your drawings are
pretty good, but it doesn't make sense, OK?

204
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,037
It's fucking stupid. OK?

205
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,516
What you need here is elevation.

206
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,355
There has to be something that happens
that's funny. What the fuck's happening here?

207
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,908
- OK. That's a banana...
- I see the banana, Gord.

208
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,877
- With string.
- I see the string.

209
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,669
With a bag of eyes on the other end,
ba-ba-baboon eyes...

210
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,149
...with sauce...

211
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,599
...uh, dripping.

212
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,035
Dripping sauce and a baboon.

213
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,277
You see what I mean?
It doesn't make any sense, Gord.

214
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,239
It sucks! The drawings are pretty good,
but the characters are lame.

215
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,676
God. The characters are lame.
I'm a loser. I wish I was dead!

216
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,593
Gord, listen! Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

217
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,592
I'm trying to give you
a piece of advice. Will you stop?

218
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,831
You gotta figure these animals out.
You gotta figure them out.

219
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,469
You gotta get inside the animals. OK?

220
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,949
Figure them out.

221
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,837
Take that out. I can't understand.

222
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,515
- I gotta get inside the animals?
- Get inside the animals.

223
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,996
- You mean I shouldn't blow my brains out?
- No. No, you shouldn't blow your brains out.

224
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,072
Wanna play in the big leagues?
You gotta work on it 24 hours a day.

225
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,311
You gotta give it weeks and weeks
and months and months and years!

226
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,234
And <i>then</i> if it doesn't work out, Gord,
<i>then</i> blow your fucking brains out.

227
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,552
But, sir, I can't work on this all day.
I got a job at the cheese sandwich factory.

228
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,279
The cheese sandwich factory? That's funny.

229
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,352
No, it's true. I gotta make cheese sandwiches.

230
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,670
- I got rent and...
- Gord, listen.

231
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,548
If you really wanna be an animator,
you should quit the shitty cheese job.

232
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,631
Think about it, all right?

There we go.

255
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,438
Hello?

256
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,798
Now listen, Gordie's gonna be a little upset
about being back home, so just be nice.

257
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,871
I'm home.

258
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,433
- Gordie, sit down. We're having roast beef.
- Why do you guys always have roast beef?

259
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,277
Boo-hoo! Little Lord Fauntleroy's tummy
hurts cos there's too much roast beef in it.

260
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,669
It's just boring.

261
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,355
- I'm eating a chicken sandwich.
- You're not!

262
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,718
This is crazy. I'm 28 years old. I should
be able to eat a chicken sandwich if I want.

263
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,072
He's 28 years old and he can eat
a chicken sandwich. Very impressive.

264

Mike Fitzgibbon's son

...and my son can eat a chicken!

266
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,311
Jim, no!

267
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,712
You can either eat that goddamn roast beef,
or you can go to bed.

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,631
Good.

269
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,072
Sh. Gord! Gord!
Don't hammer 'em so loud. Jeez.

270
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,038
It's late. You're gonna wake up your parents.

271
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,396
- You're right. I'll use the electric nail gun.
- Yeah.

272
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,513
Sh. Sh. Gord. Gord!

273
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,353
- What?
- Oh, boys!

274
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,157
Will you two faggots stop making
so fucking much noise? We're sleeping.

275

Sh!

276
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,950
Goddammit!

277
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,110
It's three in the morning!

278
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,510
- Stop the fucking hammering!
- Jim, I got a kid over here. OK?

279
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,196
- Gord, are you almost done over there?
- Yeah, nearly, Mr. Malloy.

280
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,750
Hey, Gord.
Can I play on your ramp tomorrow?

281
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,513
Sure, Andy. Any time.

282
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,948
Has your dad got, like, bowel problems?

283
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,636
- Let's skate this thing.
- Don't you think it's kinda dark, Gord?

284
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,312
I gotta work tomorrow.

285
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,713
You mean to say we're finished now and you
are not gonna enjoy the fruits of your labor?

286
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,112
I don't have the right shoes on.
They're slippery and they got no sole.

287
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,675
- Just enjoy the fruits here.
- Don't say "the fruits".

288
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,599
OK.

289
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,751
Holy shit.

290
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,234
Dirty little shit! You think that's funny?
I gotta work in the morning.

291
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,912
Argh!

292
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,472
- Dad, what the fuck? He hurt his leg.
- He shouldn't have been screaming out here.

293
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,869
Oh, Jesus Christ.

294
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,515
Oh! Oh, Christ! Oh, God!

295
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,397
Get him a job!

296
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,870
Get him an ambulance!
You get a job. He's got a job.

297
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,515
What the hell are you doing?

298
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,232
- Hi. I'm looking for my friend Darren.
- Sh.

299
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,513
Wow. That's a...
Oh, that's a neat trick you do there.

300
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,512
Yeah! Yeah, my record's seven in a row.

301
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,752
Oh!

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,833
Wow. Are hospitals always this fun?

303
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,799
No. Sometimes... Sometimes
people here die of cancer.

304
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,115
- Cancer, huh?
- Yeah.

305
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,872
Hi, I'm Gord.

306
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,791
Hi. I'm Betty.

307
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,479
Uh...

308
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,758
- That creamer game's fun.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's my hobby.

309
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,236
- Yeah. My passion is...
- Creamers?

310
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,278
No! No. Not just the creamers.

311
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,828
Physics. Flight, actually.

312
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,198
I'm kind of a rocket scientist,
to tell the truth. Yeah.

313
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,352
Well, OK, amateur. Amateur rocket scientist.

314
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,113
- It's still pretty crazy.
- Yeah. I know.

315
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,072
- What do you do?
- Me, uh...

316
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,630
Investments. I do investments.

317
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,793
Um... Consulting in the business... business.

318
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,918
Um, analyzing stocks.

319
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,755
Uh... NASDAQ, Dow Jones,
<i>Wall Street Journal...</i>

320
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,277
...uh, New York City, CNN.
- Oh, wow. Wow. You must be rich.

321
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,355
Yeah. You know, they have creamers
in places other than hospitals.

322
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,318
And I thought...
If this is forward, just tell me...

323
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,710
...but maybe we could go to
one of those places, like a restaurant.

324
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,678
We could flip them together there sometime.

325
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,955
Uh...

326
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,235
That'd be fun. Here's my number.

327
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,912
OK. Call me.

328
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,437
Oh, gotta run. I'll talk to you soon.
Call me, Gord.

329
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,837
Bye!

330
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,671
Have you seen that girl, the doctor?

331
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,116
No. I haven't exactly been able
to get up and wander around, Gord.

332
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,988
OK, well, it's weird cos I asked her out
on a date and she said yes.

333
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,356
- Yeah, that is weird.
- Excuse me. Could you keep it down?

334
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,635
This is a hospital room and I'm pregnant.

335
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,156
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't realize that you were pregnant.

336
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,313
So anyway, that girl I asked out on a date,
see, I thought she could walk.

337
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,679
- She's handicapped? Is that what you mean?
- She's in a wheelchair.

338
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,311
Could you please just shut the fuck up?!
I am fucking pregnant!

339
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,109
- You saying you hate people in wheelchairs?
- I don't hate them.

340
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,476
I think it's clear what you're saying.
You hate the handicapped.

341
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,518
I don't. You're handicapped.
I don't hate you. See?

342
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,997
You're handicapped. You're handicapped.

343
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,277
- You bastard!
- My baby's coming! My baby is coming!

344
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,112
Help.

345
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,955
Help. My baby is coming.

346
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,439
Oh, no.

347
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,317
No, no, no.

348
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,391
Oh! Oh!

349
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,958
- Are you OK, ma'am?
- My baby is coming. My baby is coming.

350
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,032
- Call the doctor, you fucking asshole!
- It's OK. I'm a doctor.

351
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,236
No, get me a real doctor.

352
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,834
I am a real doctor. See? I'm a real doctor.

353
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,034
Get away from me!

354
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,514
- Here. Spread your legs for me, OK?
- No! No!

355
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,194
What are you doing? What are you doing?!

356
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,631
- I see the problem here.
- Don't.

357
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,271
There seems to be a little baby
inside your body.

358
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,874
Here. Give me your head, little fellow.

359
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,032
Give me your head, little fellow.
Here, little fellow.

360
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,075
I got you. I got you. I got her. I got her.

361
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,435
I got her. I got her. I got her. I got her.

362
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,031
Put it back, Gord.

363
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,352
You gotta cut the cord.
You gotta cut the cord.

364
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,556
Jeez, do I have to do everything?

365
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,235
Oh, God. Help me.

366
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,194
Why isn't it crying?

367
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,191
Uh, it's sleeping?

368
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,159
- Give me my baby, you fucker!
- I'll wake up your baby.

369
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,198
- Gordie!
- Wakey-wakey! Wakey-wakey!

370
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,831
Wakey-wakey! Wakey-wakey!

371
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,431
I saved the day.

372
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,231
Thank you.

373
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,231
I saved the day.

374
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,109
I saved the day.

375
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,393
My pretty baby girl.

376
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,708
- Don't ever come back. Ever.
- I saved the day.

377
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,314
- You did not save the day.
- What's going on, Gord?

378
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,871
I saved the day. Don't touch
my shoulder, OK? I saved the day.

379
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,633
Seems like they got
a problem with heroes around here.

380
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,109
I saved the day, Betty.

381
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,430
- I'll call you tonight.
- OK.

382
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,832
Hey! Come on in. Just got four in a row.

383
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,478
- What?
- Creamers. Four creamer flips in a row.

384
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,949
- Come watch.
- Oh, cool.

385
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,431
Whoo! I got another one.

386
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,879
- No way. Are those actually rockets?
- Uh-huh.

387
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,748
- I'm designing a rocket-powered wheelchair.
- Really?

388
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,308
- That's incredible. Does it work?
- No.

389
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,677
No, I haven't been able
to quite figure it out yet.

390
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,115
Don't you feel like a stupid dummy?

391
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,799
- Excuse me?
- You tried to make it work, but it doesn't.

392
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,111
- It must make you feel like a stupid dummy.
- No.

393
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,392
I didn't expect to master the intricacies
of rocketry on my first attempt. It's a process.

394
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,076
- You sort of learn from your mistakes.
- Hm. Never thought of it like that.

395
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,877
Besides, they don't let me
work on it at the hospital.

396
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,635
They don't think handicapped people
should go fast, but it's bullshit...

397
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,075
...cos I like going fast and I like rockets...

398
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,869
...because they're hot...
and hard... and long.

399
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,153
Actually, I thought we could
kinda go to a movie or something.

400
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,951
Uh, hi.

401
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,237
How are you?

402
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,633
Be a lot better if you'd spank my legs
with this bamboo.

403
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,790
Um...

404
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,074
What?

405
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,990
Just whack it against my shins
as hard as you can, OK?

406
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,071
Uh... I guess.

407
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,350
Um...

408
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,035
How's that?

409
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,429
Come on, Gordie.
You can do better than that.

410
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,715
What are you, a little puss?

411
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,837
- A puss? A pussy?
- Come on.

412
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,390
- Come on, pussy. You can do better.
- Pussy? I don't know...

413
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,789
- How's that?
- Come on, pussy, pussy!

414
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,954
Don't be shy, little pussy.

415
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,350
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

416
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,349
Oh, come on, I wanna see them bleed!

417
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,509
Oh, yeah! I felt a tingle!

418
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,154
Oh, don't stop! Oh, yeah!

419
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,832
Oh! Oh!

420
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,031
You wanna get another tingle?

421
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,793
Ow! Gord, what the fuck?

422
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,828
Not my face! It's not my face
that's paralyzed, you fuck!

423
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,675
Sorry. I...

424
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,832
I've never really caned anyone before.

425
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,236
It's OK.

426
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,515
It's your turn now.

427
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,359
OK.

428
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,034
Don't do it too hard, though.

429
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,509
I've got sensitive knees.

430
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,870
Oh, I'm not gonna whack your legs
with the bamboo, Gord.

431
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,198
I'm gonna give you a blow job.

432
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,794
Betty, it's only our first date. We should go
do romantic stuff first, like walk in the park.

433
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,316
- I can't walk.
- Maybe I could take you out for a roll.

434
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,111
I'd rather stay here and suck!

435
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,674
The thing is... I think... OK.

436
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,710
Come here, Gord.

437
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,670
Uh...

438
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,352
Hm.

439
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,312
Um...

440
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,911
That's my umbilical cord.

441
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,395
Oh? Didn't you ever have that removed?

442
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,959
Um...

443
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,235
It's taped. It's just for fun.

444
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,269
I taped it there for fun.

445
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,637
Uh...

446
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,195
OK. I can work around it.

447
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,550
Wait... wait... wait...

448
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,108
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

449
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,119
OK.

450
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,671
- Hello, Father.
- Hey, Freddy!

451
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,709
- How are you, son?
- I'm working hard, just like you taught me.

452
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,156
- You moving back home, Freddy?
- What? No, no, no.

453
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,993
No way, Mother. I'm a man now.

454
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,993
I'm all grown up and I'm out on my own
and I'm earning a good living.

455
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,352
- Is it gonna be a busy day at the bank today?
- Well, I sure hope so.

456
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,676
Is that, um...?

457
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,117
Your big brother. He couldn't handle the
complexities of making a cheese sandwich...

458
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,476
...so now he's back home with us.
- Wow.

459
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,348
Jeez, is that idiot still in the shower?
Shit, how much water is he gonna use?

460
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,556
Yeah, how much is he gonna use? All of it?

461
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,200
He should save some for the fish. Huh, Pop?

462
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,597
Gord!

463
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,831
I'll fix him.

464
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,310
How's the water? Cold enough for ya?

465
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,274
Dammit. Don't tell me you're so stupid, you
can't tell the difference between hot and cold.

466
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,512
- What the fuck is going on?
- I'm underwater. Look, I found a treasure.

467
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,833
- A treasure? That's soap on a rope.
- Sh. I'm pretending it's a treasure.

468
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,117
Get out of my goddamn scuba gear,
you imbecile.

469
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,755
Oh, no, the treasure!
It went into that underwater cave.

470
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,391
Get out of that toilet!

471
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,112
Get out of that toilet!

472
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,033
Father, you saved me
from the giant barracuda.

473
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,079
But, look, I salvaged the treasure.
We can live like kings.

474
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,993
- We can live like kings!
- Forget that fucking soap.

475
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,108
Clean up this mess and get your ass
out that door looking for a job, you retard.

476
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,071
He's driving me insane.

477
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,632
No. No, you're driving him insane.

478
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,712
You're older than me
and you still live at home.

479
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,030
I have a job, you know. I pay my own way.

480
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,557
- You work in a bank. Should I be dazzled?
- Well, at least I don't live at home.

481
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,315
No, you live in a tiny shithole
and you come here to eat for free.

482
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,312
Whatever. Listen, I'm off to work now, OK?

483
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,551
Me and Dad have jobs.
We're doing something with our lives.

484
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,950
It's time for you to grow up.
Good luck with that job hunt, OK?

485
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,952
All right. Let's cross our fingers.
OK, Freddy?

486
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,077
Let's cross our fingers
and hope I get a job. I'm serious.

487
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,117
Just cross your fingers.

488
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,191
All right! Fingers crossed.

489
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,236
I hope I get a jobbie, Freddy.
I got my fingers crossed.

490
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,835
- I hope I get a job. I got my fingers crossed.
- Goodbye, Gord.

491
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,593
I got my fingers crossed.

492
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,070
Crossed. Crossed. Cro...

00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,114
No, I got a job working nights
at a computer company.

521
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,398
I was borrowing one of your suits till I could
get enough money to buy one of my own.

Are you kidding? You can keep that suit.

Oh, Gord, I knew you had it in ya.
You're just a late bloomer, that's all.

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,957
Yeah, I just bloomed late.

Hey, can I borrow 50 bucks
or something? For supplies.

526
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,748
For, like, pens or Liquid Paper
or a Trapper Keeper...

527
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,628
...or one of those little compasses
that you put the pencil in...

- Am I doing it wrong?
- Oh, no!

542
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,949
Oh, that was incredible.
Time for your blow job, Gordie.

543
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,110
Oh, not right now, Betty.

544
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,272
- Oh, Gordie, come on.
- I thought we could have a nice evening.

545
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,669
- Don't you want me to suck it?
- No, no, no.

546
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,228
- Betty, let go. Betty, just let go.
- No, no.

547
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,838
- What, Gordie? Come on!
- Betty! Betty! Betty! Betty, come on.

548
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,512
- Betty, stop it.
- What?

549
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,591
Stop it!

550
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,510
Why are you yelling?

551
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,674
It's crazy. This is the second date we haven't
gone out on yet, and if you do this again...

552
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,230
...you'll have sucked 200% more times
than we've gone out on dates.

553
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,472
And I just think if we went out on at least
one date and you didn't do any sucking...

554
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,680
...that'd make the whole sucking-to-date
ratio far more balanced, you know?

555
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,951
Yeah. OK. Let's go out then.

556
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,191
Good. Good.

- Thank you. That was yummy.
- I'm so glad you liked it.

Andy, would you like a piece of cake?

00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,108
Am I really allowed a piece of cake, Daddy?

564
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,078
Of course you can have a piece of cake.

...is your job really hard?

It's not hard, no. I mean,
you have to be smart, really smart.

- And I like to see when they're low.
- That's interesting.

572
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,269
Sometimes they're really high.
Sometimes they're very high.

573
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,998
That's high!

574
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,517
That's when you wanna sell.
You buy them when they're down very low.

575
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,592
Yeah. I have some graphs I can show you.

576
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,958
If you pay attention to these patterns here,
you can see. I made these on my computer.

Oh, boy. I need to spill some urine.
Where can I do that?

578
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,076

- Yeah. That kid of mine is something else.

- Dad.

- You've got the problem.

You're telling me to shut up?!

657
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,513
Life's hectic. I'm having trouble
concentrating, with all the skateboarding...

658
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,068
...and you sucking my penis all the time.

659
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,754
Oh, my ear popped. My ear just popped.

660
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,108
- I think I heard it.
- When I laughed, my ear popped.

661
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,516
Well, Gordie, maybe
you're concentrating a little too hard.

662
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,751
Maybe you just need to relax while you draw.

663
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,277
You know, eat some food, play some music.

664
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,672
I only have two hands, Betty.
How am I supposed to do all that?

665
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,558
- What?
- Eat food and play music and draw?

666
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,718
- What?
- At the same time?

667
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,231
Oh... yeah.

668
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,150
# Sausages, sausages, sausages
Sausages, sausages, sausages

669
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,837
What in the name of
sweet breakfast meats are you doing?

670
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,115
For your information, I'm being creative.

671
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,556
Betty told me this is what
I need to do to become an artist.

672
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,756
Oh, yeah? Is it working?

673
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,953
I don't know. I can't think of
anything to draw because I'm so stupid!

674
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,712
# I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid

675
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,076
# I'm so stupid, I'm stupid,
I'm stupid, I'm stupid, I'm stupid...

676
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,118
Shit. Hey, this is kinda funny, Gord.

677
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,312
- Yeah?
- Maybe you can't see it cos he's your dad...

678
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,358
...but he's a character, your dad.

679
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,757
- He is?
- Yeah.

680
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,276
- He's a character?
- Shit. It's your dad.

681
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,309
- # He's a real character, he's a real character
- Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Brody. Goodbye.

682
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,797
- # Sausage, sausage...
- Oh, look, honey. Our boy's a genius.

683
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,078
He's rigged a pulley system so he can eat
sausage and work on his stupid drawings.

684
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,716
I'm being creative. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I still have some work to do.

685
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,954
# Daddy, would you like some sausage?
Daddy, would you like some sausages?

686
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,158
# Daddy, would you like some sausage?
Sausages? Sausages?

687
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,037
Ow! Ow! Ow!

688
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,190
Now, you just get outside
and you just cool off!

689
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,397
If this were Pakistan, you'd have been sewing
soccer balls when you were four years old.

690
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,153
Miserable, deadbeat punk.

691
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,549
I bust my ass working for my family.

692
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,393
You take his side every time.

693
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,076
You want me to cool down?
All right, I'm gonna show you a cool down.

694
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,549
Oh, just keep kissing his ass.

695
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,439
Cool down!

696
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,830
Hey? How's this for a cool down? Agh!

697
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,473
I feel better already.

698
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,352
Aaaagh!

699
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,391
My ramp... Why?

700
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,029
- He's such a stupid loser.
- He's not stupid.

701
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,669
We shouldn't put up with the way
he treats us. I wouldn't stand for it.

702
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,878
If I were you, I would show him
that I deserve respect.

703
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,710
- If I were you, I would go out. I'd have sex.
- Oh, honey. No.

704
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,033
If I were you, I'd go out.
I'd have sex with strange men.

705
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,714
I'd have sex with basketball players.

706
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,950
I'd have sex with Greeks.

707
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,270
Men from Greece.

708
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,396
I'd satisfy my urges.

709
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,950
I'd satisfy my sexual desires.

710
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,679
Gordie, honey, come on.
Let's go in the house.

711
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,918
Come on.

712
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,191
Come on.

713
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,352
- That's my ramp.
- I know.

714
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,273
- He wrecked my ramp.
- I know. It's OK.

715
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,352
- My skateboard ramp.
- I'm sorry.

716
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:11,890
I had the sausages on my fingers.
I was trying to play piano.

717
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:16,170
I had the sausages.
I had the sausages and the string.

718
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:20,609
I was playing the organ,
and then he smashed my half-pipe.

719
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:23,331
Jim, do you hear what Gord is saying here?

720
00:48:23,412 --> 00:48:27,644
I hear him boohooing about his broken
wheelie-board ramp. Is that what you mean?

721
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:30,849
Yes, Jim. But do you
<i>understand</i> what he's saying?

722
00:48:31,212 --> 00:48:34,727
Sounds to me like he just wants you
to accept him as your son.

723
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:37,645
To approve of him
and what he wants to do with his life.

724
00:48:37,772 --> 00:48:39,808
How does that make you feel?

725
00:48:39,892 --> 00:48:42,804
First of all, I don't give a rat's ass
what this punk wants.

726
00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:46,487
As long as he lives in my house
and eats my food, I make the rules.

727
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:48,847
- I wanna eat chicken burgers.
- You prick.

728
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:51,526
Jim, don't hurt my baby. Now, sit down.

729
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,641
You're an embarrassment to my family.

730
00:48:57,492 --> 00:49:00,564
Oh, yeah? Well, at least
I don't touch Freddy.

731
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:03,247
- Say what?
- Excuse me?

732
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:09,005
Yeah, he touches my little brother. He takes
him behind the furnace and touches him.

733
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:11,765
- See the insanity I put up with?
- He's embarrassed.

734
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:14,286
- Jim!
- He touches my little brother.

735
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:16,442
He...

736
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:18,682
He... He fingers him.

737
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:22,321
- You're a goddamn liar.
- Jim! Do you touch him?

738
00:49:22,812 --> 00:49:24,848
Do you finger our boy?

739
00:49:24,932 --> 00:49:27,844
Don't get wacky on me.
What the fuck are we talking about?

740
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,002
Mr. Brody, this is very serious.

741
00:49:30,212 --> 00:49:34,569
Based on what I've heard here today,
I am required by law to notify the authorities.

742
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:37,530
You hear that, Dad? You're gonna pay!

743
00:49:38,372 --> 00:49:42,285
He's a molester. He's a child molester!

744
00:49:42,372 --> 00:49:43,964
Agh!

745
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:54,965
You'd better run, you li-aaaaaaar!

746
00:49:55,452 --> 00:50:00,924
<i>... so then we placed a retractor.</i>
<i>This holds the abdominal wall open.</i>

747
00:50:20,332 --> 00:50:22,482
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Uh, yes, you can.

748
00:50:22,572 --> 00:50:24,802
We're here for little Freddy.

749
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:27,643
I'm Freddy.

750
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:29,930
Oh.

751
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:32,162
Well, um...

752
00:50:32,252 --> 00:50:35,085
...Freddy, I'm a doctor.

753
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:37,163
And we need to take you with us.

754
00:50:38,212 --> 00:50:40,009
What?

755
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:44,202
- What did I do wrong?
- No. No, you didn't do anything wrong.

756
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,284
That's the most important thing
for you to remember.

757
00:50:47,372 --> 00:50:50,125
It's not your fault your dad fingered you.

758
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:53,891
What are you talking about?
My dad doesn't finger me.

759
00:50:53,972 --> 00:50:58,045
- Come on, son. We'll take you outta here.
- No! No, I'm not going anywhere.

760
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:02,444
- My father does not finger me.
- It's over, Freddy.

761
00:51:02,532 --> 00:51:06,969
We'll take you someplace where
your dad won't be able to hurt you any more.

762
00:51:07,052 --> 00:51:09,361
- Officer.
- Come with me, son.

763
00:51:09,452 --> 00:51:12,364
Guys, my dad doesn't finger me.
Are you crazy?

764
00:51:12,452 --> 00:51:14,727
It's OK, Freddy. It's OK.
You'll be safe now.

765
00:51:14,812 --> 00:51:17,007
I'm 25 years old.

766
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,891
Dad?

767
00:51:19,972 --> 00:51:21,166
Dad!

768
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:23,607
- Dad!
- What are you doing with my boy?

769
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:25,967
- Help.
- I'll get you a lawyer.

770
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:28,407
Freddy, no!

771
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:32,324
- I've never been fingered!
- It's OK, Julie.

772
00:51:32,572 --> 00:51:37,600
Your husband's deeply disturbed and we
won't let him hurt your little boy any more.

773
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:40,643
I didn't do anything.

774
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:44,491
What are you looking at, bitch?

775
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:46,725

822
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:30,284

00:54:30,372 --> 00:54:34,490

824
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:35,971
<i># Oh, lordy...</i>

825
00:54:36,892 --> 00:54:39,167
Oh, shit.

826
00:54:43,932 --> 00:54:47,129
Oh, the hypergolic propellants aren't mixing.

827
00:54:58,172 --> 00:55:01,084
Ah, of course. It's the oxidizer.

828
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,362
Too bad it didn't work, huh?

829
00:55:03,452 --> 00:55:06,649
Oh, hey, Gord. How are
the animations coming along?

830
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:11,001
Well, see, there's been a change in plans.

831
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:15,768
I figured, instead of following my dream
of being an animator, I'm just gonna give up.

832
00:55:15,852 --> 00:55:17,490
Why?

833
00:55:17,572 --> 00:55:19,164
Because.

834
00:55:19,252 --> 00:55:21,766
- Because why?
- Cos why shouldn't I?

835
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:24,525
My dad was right all along. It is stupid.

836
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:29,447
It's time I grow up and get a job,
instead of acting like a little baby all the time.

837
00:55:30,612 --> 00:55:33,080
But you're not a baby. You cant just quit.

838
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:35,402
Shut up, Betty. Just shut up.

839
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:40,807
I've as much a chance of being an animator
as you have of getting this chair to work.

840
00:55:40,892 --> 00:55:43,201
Can't you see we're both just stupid idiots?

841
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,408
- Gord...
- "Gord!"

842
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:47,329
"Gordie!"

843
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:51,927
I'm so close to getting this rocket to work.

844
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:54,810
Rockets! Rockets!
"I'm gonna get my rockets to work!"

845
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:56,723
It's always about the rockets.

846
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,803
It's always about the rockets.

847
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:14,007
<i>(# "Girls and Boys Come out to Play")</i>

848
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:18,721

<i>The moon is shining bright as day</i>

00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:22,725

<i>Come to your playfellows in the street</i>

<i># Up the ladder and down the wall</i>
<i>A penny loaf will serve us all</i>

852
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:34,563
You got fingered?

853
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:37,724
No. OK?

854
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,763
It's OK.

855
00:56:42,452 --> 00:56:44,443
I know.

856
00:56:46,452 --> 00:56:50,365
<i>Now I'll tell you once more.</i>
<i>Stop trying to act so grown up.</i>

857
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,807
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, moron.

858
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:08,407
I ordered a cheese sandwich
and there's hardly any cheese in here.

859
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:10,483
That's no good, is it?

860
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:13,928
Here, give me your sandwich.
I will fix it for you.

861
00:57:15,812 --> 00:57:20,044
You can't have complaints there's not
enough cheese in the cheese sandwiches.

862
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:24,887
I mean, if there's no cheese in a cheese
sandwich, that's just two slices of bread.

863
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:28,851
If word of that were to get out,
well, I could lose my job.

864
00:57:28,932 --> 00:57:30,888
I could lose all of this!

865
00:57:30,972 --> 00:57:32,963
And we wouldn't want that, would we?

866
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:34,520
Would we?

867
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:36,046
Would we?

868
00:57:36,132 --> 00:57:38,043
Huh?!

869
00:57:40,212 --> 00:57:44,683
- What the fuck am I gonna do with that?
- You could stick it in your bum-bum.

870
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:50,088
You can put the cheese in your bum.

871
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:55,642
- <i>... go on upstairs to your room.</i>
- <i>OK. If that's what you want.</i>

872
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:58,328
Julie!

873
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:00,403
Sweetheart, wait.

874
00:58:01,332 --> 00:58:03,129
Let's talk, sugar.

875
00:58:03,212 --> 00:58:07,091
There's nothing to talk about.
I can't be with you another second.

876
00:58:07,172 --> 00:58:09,402
Wait. What about our dreams, baby doll?

877
00:58:09,492 --> 00:58:13,167
I'm sure you'd rather find
some young boys instead of me.

878
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:17,882
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I saw what you were doing downstairs.

879
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:20,611
Whatever you saw
was completely out of context.

880
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:24,208
I just told him to fuck me
because Gord said "Fuck you, Dad."

881
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:28,524
Don't you get it? Fuck you, fuck me.
Fuck you, fuck me. Fuck you, fuck me.

882
00:58:31,692 --> 00:58:34,889
And I never fingered Freddy!

883
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:58,364
<i>And now over to Phil,</i>
<i>who has a special-interest story. Phil?</i>

884
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:03,685
<i>We've heard of electric wheelchairs, but</i>
<i>have you heard of one powered by rockets?</i>

885
00:59:03,772 --> 00:59:09,005
<i>A girl by the name of Betty Menger may not</i>
<i>be able to walk, but it hasn't slowed her down.</i>

886
00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:14,928
<i>She's a scientist who designed a wheelchair</i>
<i>that does 0 to 60 in under four seconds.</i>

887
00:59:15,772 --> 00:59:17,364
She did it.

888
00:59:22,252 --> 00:59:24,243
<i>Look at her go!</i>

889
00:59:28,412 --> 00:59:30,403
Way to go, Betty.

890
00:59:31,012 --> 00:59:32,604
Yeah, hi.

891
00:59:33,252 --> 00:59:37,689
Do you think that I pay you to stand
around watching TV? Get back to work.

892
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:41,607
- Sorry, kid. I don't think this'll work out.
- Don't call me kid.

893
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:45,651
Sir, although I respect your authority here
at Submarine Supreme...

894
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:48,246
...and I admire your position of power...

895
00:59:48,332 --> 00:59:52,405
...I regretfully am going to have to again
bow out of the sandwich industry...

896
00:59:52,492 --> 00:59:55,882
...because in reality I am an animator.

897
00:59:56,812 --> 00:59:59,610
I'm an animator, OK?

898
01:00:05,212 --> 01:00:06,645
See ya.

899
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:10,327
- Where the hell d'you think you're going?
- To get a job, Dad. OK?

900
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:12,926
- You must think I'm a damn idiot.
- Uh... yes.

901
01:00:13,012 --> 01:00:14,968
Bullshit, you're getting a job!

902
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:17,520
You're a liar. You're grounded, you liar.

903
01:00:17,612 --> 01:00:21,048
- Grounded? I'm 28 years old.
- I don't care! Go to your room.

904
01:00:21,132 --> 01:00:24,647
Bye-bye, Daddy. Bye-bye, Daddy.
I'm going to get a jobbie!

905
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:27,644
No, you're not!
Not in this damn car you're not!

906
01:00:27,732 --> 01:00:31,441
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Fuck you! Thief! Thief! Thief!

907
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:38,680
- Where the fuck is he?
- Mr. Brody?

908
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:41,286
- Where's my son?
- What?

909
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:42,964
Where is he?

910
01:00:43,052 --> 01:00:45,725
Mr. Brody, please! I don't know. Agh!

911
01:00:45,812 --> 01:00:48,610
Are you gonna tell me, you little punk-ass?

912
01:00:50,812 --> 01:00:53,565
He's in Hollywood, selling his cartoons.

913
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,731
Aaaaagh!

914
01:01:11,612 --> 01:01:14,206
Japan 4!

915
01:01:15,812 --> 01:01:17,211
OK. Davidson for four...

916
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:23,050
Mr. Davidson, I have
something you need to see.

917
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:26,124
- Is there a bomb in there, Gord?
- It's not a bomb.

918
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:30,531
I did what you told me. I quit my shitty
cheese job, moved in with my parents.

919
01:01:30,612 --> 01:01:34,241
I worked really hard and
I came up with a concept. It's called:

920
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:36,449
..."Zebras in America". OK?

921
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:38,648
It's about a family who move to America.

922
01:01:38,732 --> 01:01:42,441
It's a classic fish-out-of-water story,
except it's not fish...

923
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,127
...it's, uh, zebras... out of water.

924
01:01:46,212 --> 01:01:51,047
- Zebras don't live in water, but I understand.
- I know. That's what I'm talking about.

925
01:01:51,132 --> 01:01:54,283
The zebras aren't in the water.
It's like <i>Splash.</i>

926
01:01:54,372 --> 01:01:59,366
I saw it. I loved it. But is this the father
character with a goatee like you? Is that him?

927
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:02,728
- Yeah.
- Just seems a little unrealistic, that's all.

928
01:02:02,812 --> 01:02:04,211
- Unrealistic?
- Yeah.

929
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:09,964
- He's a centaur, like a half-man, half-zebra.
- Right. <i>Clash of the Titans.</i> I saw it. I get it.

930
01:02:10,052 --> 01:02:12,361
Half-man, half-zebra, mutant. He's a...

931
01:02:12,452 --> 01:02:15,922
- The myth. The myth.
- It's a myth. It's like a Greek myth.

932
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:18,526
It's like a Greek myth, except African.

933
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:21,172
- African...
- African-American-Greek...

934
01:02:21,252 --> 01:02:22,571
- Myth.
- Yes.

935
01:02:26,132 --> 01:02:28,202
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, you can, miss.

936
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,601
Get off your ass and tell me where my son is.

937
01:02:30,692 --> 01:02:33,411
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Get the fuck out...

938
01:02:33,492 --> 01:02:35,289
Argh!

939
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:41,728
- But the father is real.
- Nobody does this shit. I don't buy it.

940
01:02:41,812 --> 01:02:43,928
- It doesn't seem real.
- Here you are...

941
01:02:44,012 --> 01:02:47,800
...you goddamn lying,
car-thieving, doodling time-waster!

942
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:54,329
- What's so fucking funny, you little prick?
- You're funny.

943
01:02:54,412 --> 01:02:58,849
You think it's funny to brainwash my kid,
so he sits around with his fingers up his ass?

944
01:02:58,932 --> 01:03:00,888
I'll show you what's funny.

945
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:05,966
- Mr. Davidson, run!
- Don't hurt me, big daddy. Don't hurt me(!)

946
01:03:07,132 --> 01:03:11,091
This is my son here. I'm the father here.

947
01:03:11,172 --> 01:03:14,767
I'll get you. Goddamn you, Gord.
You son of a bitch!

948
01:03:15,172 --> 01:03:16,969
You too, you little prick!

949
01:03:17,052 --> 01:03:19,850
Ow! That hurt. Hey. Ow.

950
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,289
Great job. Nice show.

951
01:03:22,372 --> 01:03:25,569
Where d'you get this guy?
Central Casting? He is fucking great.

952
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:28,086
It was hilarious, Gord. That's great shit.

953
01:03:28,732 --> 01:03:31,644
Mr. Davidson, I'm sorry.
That's my father. He's crazy.

954
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:35,805
Gord, whatever. Do me a favor,
stop the act. Let me tell you something.

955
01:03:37,092 --> 01:03:39,560
I've been doing this job, OK, for six years.

956
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:42,803
I have never seen a more
creative or exciting pitch than that.

957
01:03:42,892 --> 01:03:47,044
I wasn't even thinking about writing
a cheque today, but with such creativity...

958
01:03:47,132 --> 01:03:50,522
...I'm comfortable
green-lighting this fucking project.

959
01:03:50,612 --> 01:03:56,050
I'm gonna write you a cheque right now for,
I don't know, how's $1 million sound to you?

960
01:03:57,052 --> 01:03:59,202
Oh... Uh...

961
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:02,090
- Sound good?
- Sounds...

962
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:04,531
Hi, my name is Harry.

963
01:04:06,132 --> 01:04:08,044
Do you hear the funny sound?

964
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,045
It's my hooves. It's my hooves.

965
01:04:12,212 --> 01:04:15,602
<i>In Africa, the humans hated us</i>
<i>because of our zebra lower bodies.</i>

966
01:04:15,692 --> 01:04:18,604
<i>And zebras hated us</i>
<i>because of our human upper bodies.</i>

967
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:22,526
<i>So my family moved from Africa</i>
<i>to start over in America.</i>

968
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:25,206
<i>But life in America wasn't perfect.</i>

969
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:30,290
<i>Especially for zebras who are</i>
<i>used to living in fields, not houses.</i>

970
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:34,531
My hooves. My hooves.

971
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:39,170
My dad was weird in Africa,
but America made him crazy.

972
01:04:39,532 --> 01:04:44,242
I'm not getting a stupid job, Dad.
I never had a part-time job in Africa.

973
01:04:44,332 --> 01:04:46,448
How dare you!

974
01:04:49,212 --> 01:04:53,171
How do you like that, fucker?
How do you like that, fucker? Huh, fucker?

975
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:57,165
You fucker. You fucker.
Fucker! Huh, fucker? Fucker!

976
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:58,486
Check us out.

977
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:03,965
You'll love how simple misunderstandings
get us into a whole heap of trouble. It's crazy.

978
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:06,805
Listen to my hooves.

979
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:08,962

- No, not just how to whack off an elephant.

1103

1104

things differently, but I got that from you...

no matter what other people think.

1106
