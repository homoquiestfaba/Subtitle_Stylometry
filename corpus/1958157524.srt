1
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:58,452
<i>The formal garden</i>

2
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,689
<i>imposes geometric strictures</i>
<i>on plants.</i>

3
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>Circles, squares, triangles.</i>

4
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:08,462
<i>These are also known</i>
<i>as French gardens.</i>

5
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:10,397
<i>Informal gardens,</i>

6
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,667
<i>also known as British gardens,</i>

7
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,770
<i>were popularized</i>
<i>in the 18th century</i>

8
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:19,373
<i>and adhere to the shapes</i>
<i>and contours of nature.</i>

9
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,078
<i>A third type, the wild garden,</i>

10
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,346
<i>only appears to be wild.</i>

11
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,382
<i>It contains a seemingly</i>

12
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,351
<i>random variety</i>
<i>of plants and shrubs</i>

13
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,354
<i>which supports</i>
<i>insects and wildlife.</i>

14
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,126
<i>Gardening is a belief</i>
<i>in the future.</i>

15
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,229
<i>A belief that things will</i>
<i>happen according to plan.</i>

16
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:47,334
<i>That change will come</i>
<i>in its due time.</i>

17
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,865
Okay.

18
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,369
We have officially begun

19
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,840
the timeline for this year's
Spring Charity Auction.

20
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,711
Charles Grow and Company
have begun the event logistics.

21
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:32,714
No doubt you've been following
the design schema.

22
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:36,316
I don't envisage there's going
to be any changes,

23
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,152
so we're locked and loaded.

24
00:03:38,853 --> 00:03:41,022
Xavier and I are going
through the assignments

25
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:42,422
and after this,

26
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,392
Maggie and Xavier will head over
to the main greenhouse.

27
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,529
Last year's Charity Auction,

28
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:52,365
uh, collected 150,000
for Meals on Wheels.

29
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,469
This year,
I would like to exceed that.

30
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,740
Not just for the community,
but for...

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,909
Ms. Haverhill herself.

32
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:04,311
When you're ready.

33
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,695
<i>The angel wings</i>
<i>have recovered.</i>

34
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,263
Mm,
that was quite a scorching.

35
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:24,932
I don't know
what I was thinking.

36
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,636
You can't spreadsheet nature.
It'll only surprise you.

37
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,139
They'll recover
in the gate garden.

38
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,508
Mm, more beautiful than ever.

39
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,878
For the visitors,
they'll be "a moment."

40
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,613
Mr. Roth?

41
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,481
We got a message
from the Gracewood house.

42
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,416
Ms. Haverhill
would like you to drop by.

43
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,452
- When?
- Whenever you have a chance.

44
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,088
Nothing urgent.

45
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,456
Well, we all know
what that means.

46
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,589
- Janine.
- Narvel.

47
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,257
Take a seat on the porch.

48
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,992
Ms. Norma will be out
in a moment.

49
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,365
Hello, hello.

50
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,577
Narv.

51
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,179
Sweet Pea.

52
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,750
- Shall I go and change?
- No, porch is just fine.

53
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:56,423
I love the early morning rain.

54
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,359
It's very, uh...

55
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,263
What's the word?

56
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,431
Nitrogen oxide.

57
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,768
Soulful.

58
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,904
Yes, that's it.

59
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:11,973
Move over.

60
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,210
You know I named him Porch Dog
when he was just a pup.

61
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,213
I knew that was all
he'd ever be good for.

62
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,850
Now, how's the event coming?

63
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,286
Oh, very good.

64
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,488
I'll walk you through
the garden preparations.

65
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,091
Thanks, Ronnie.

66
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,163
Last year's show
had a wonderful reception.

67
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,598
- Hmm.
- This year,

68
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,001
we're going
to ramp up the auction a bit.

69
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:43,804
A dozen variegated
monstera cuttings,

70
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:46,908
our crème de la crème
Princess Irene bulbs,

71
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:49,944
and this year,
thanks to Yong Nursery,

72
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,213
- a slipper orchid.
- Hmm.

73
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,581
It's always fun

74
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,149
to watch grown men
in pastel pants

75
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:57,151
outbid each other over a flower.

76
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,025
But that's not the reason
why you asked me to join you.

77
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,763
What is it, Norma?

78
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,999
- I have a favor to ask.
- What is it?

79
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,104
My sister Betty's daughter
had a daughter.

80
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,640
That makes her my grandniece.

81
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,709
Well, my sister's been long gone

82
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,644
and last year,
her daughter died.

83
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,981
And it's been hard
on my grandniece, so I hear.

84
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,849
She's mixed blood.

85
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,818
When she was a child,

86
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,787
she would come to Gracewood
with her mother.

87
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,090
One summer,
they came every week.

88
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:40,528
And Maya, that's her name,
was enchanted.

89
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:42,997
Enchanting...

90
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,733
just to see her play
in the gardens.

91
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,468
Here's a picture.

92
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,276
When her parents broke up...
He was a bum...

93
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,078
...they moved away.

94
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,647
You know,
how she ended up with him.

95
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,882
No accounting
for people's taste.

96
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,884
It was okay with me, of course.

97
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,120
And then she got cancer.

98
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,590
Like my sister before her.
Tit cancer.

99
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:13,728
Well, Maya's life apparently
hasn't turned out so well.

100
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,197
She got in a funk,
dropped out of school,

101
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,667
and then lifestyle choices,
I believe they call them.

102
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:21,469
A bad crowd.

103
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,437
It was only a matter of time.

104
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,673
I felt I should do something.

105
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,043
I would like you
to take Maya on

106
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,277
as an apprentice.

107
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:34,882
I will provide transportation
and minimum wage

108
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,385
with adjustments.

109
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,354
You will teach her
how to tend a garden

110
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,792
as well as classes
in horticulture and so forth.

111
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,694
What age is she?

112
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,529
I'm not sure.

113
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:49,997
Twenty?

114
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,999
No, more.

115
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,535
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

116
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,437
I haven't.

117
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,972
That's your job.

118
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,107
She's family.

119
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,476
Gracewood is family.

120
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:05,446
And you would like me
to respond how?

121
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,051
I was hoping you'd say,
"Norma, it would be a pleasure

122
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,486
to be of assistance
to your grandniece."

123
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,922
Norma, it would be a pleasure

124
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,526
to be of assistance
to your grandniece.

125
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:18,692
Good.

126
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,529
Now, let's see
about that garden.

127
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,796
Hmm.

128
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:23,464
Come on, boy.

129
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,835
Come on.

130
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,773
There's a few variations
this year,

131
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,776
some practical, some seasonal.

132
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,679
You know what they say, Narv?

133
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,781
Money is the best manure.

134
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,917
- Hmm.
- The better the money,

135
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,885
the better the manure.

136
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,121
<i>She went on to explain</i>

137
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,824
<i>that aesthetic gardens</i>
<i>were a recent development.</i>

138
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:53,562
<i>In colonial times,</i>
<i>gardens were utilitarian.</i>

139
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:57,765
<i>A cross between</i>
<i>a grocery store and a pharmacy.</i>

140
00:09:58,466 --> 00:09:59,867
<i>In the Gilded Age,</i>

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,403
<i>they became</i>
<i>an entrance to high society,</i>

142
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,306
<i>a place of conspicuous display.</i>

143
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:08,409
At Gracewood,
we have the best of both worlds.

144
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,712
Four generations
of curated botany,

145
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,882
horticulture, and display.

146
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,351
Now...

147
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,653
where were we, Sweet Pea?

148
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:23,257
You were wondering
which color dress would be best.

149
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,194
You wore the emerald green
last year.

150
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,865
With white frill
on the sleeves and neck.

151
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,299
That's right.

152
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,968
I looked pretty good.

153
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,803
Yes, you did.

154
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:39,840
Porch Dog, come.

155
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:41,442
You silly.

156
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,414
<i>The soft yellow</i>
<i>autumn minaret daylilies</i>

157
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:51,952
<i>begin their long season first,</i>
<i>the second week of July.</i>

158
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,188
<i>A week later,</i>

159
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,824
<i>a profusion of sunset cosmos</i>
<i>follows.</i>

160
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,595
<i>Their sulfur petals</i>
<i>overshadow the daylilies.</i>

161
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,329
<i>Then,</i>

162
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:05,933
<i>just before high summer,</i>
<i>the color wheel comes alive.</i>

163
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,402
<i>Toward the end of the month,</i>

164
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:11,405
<i>overnight, the purple</i>
<i>and pink perennial asters</i>

165
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,673
<i>burst into bloom</i>

166
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,076
<i>and for 38 hours</i>
<i>they are all glowing.</i>

167
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,254
We're gardeners.

168
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,323
We pull out the weeds.

169
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,079
Hello.

170
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,483
- I'm Narvel Roth.
- Narvel?

171
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,218
What kind of name is that?

172
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:34,121
What kind of name is Maya?

173
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:37,324
Well,
that is my name.

174
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,127
Where's Norma?

175
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,329
Ms. Haverhill

176
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,932
thought she'd give you
a little time to get settled in.

177
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,270
When was the last time
you saw her? Oh, have a seat.

178
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,041
Uh...

179
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,811
I don't know.
Years.

180
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,549
She said that you used
to come here with your mother.

181
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,752
- Do you remember that?
- Of course.

182
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:08,556
It looks the same. Mostly.
Ex... except for that.

183
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:12,426
- Magenta garden.
- Mm-hmm.

184
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,496
What did Ms. Haverhill
say to you?

185
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:19,266
- When she called?
- Uh...

186
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,536
I can't remember. Um...

187
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:26,173
Yeah, she said she had a job.
Like an apprenticeship.

188
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,175
Do I get paid?

189
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,311
Well, you started getting paid

190
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,179
the moment you stepped
out of the car.

191
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:33,881
Minimum wage.

192
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,116
It goes up every month.

193
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,385
Car service included.

194
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,354
You provide your own lunch.

195
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:45,025
And I pull the weeds?

196
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,227
Well, that's part of it.

197
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,464
It's also an education.

198
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,802
You'll learn how to garden

199
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:57,104
and you'll also have classes
in the history of gardens

200
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:00,174
and horticulture, botany.

201
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:04,746
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

202
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,548
And I'll be your teacher.

203
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,215
One hour a day.

204
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,219
There'll be assignments
and quizzes.

205
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,455
Does that interest you?

206
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,290
Uh...

207
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,532
Do you hope to someday work
in a garden?

208
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:37,044
Good.

209
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,851
Well, let's get you changed,

210
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,419
and... I'll introduce you

211
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:48,155
to some of the folk
that work here.

212
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:52,092
Okay.

213
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,171
There's the grand house.

214
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,342
This is the main potting shed.

215
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,945
Part of it is being converted
into a common room.

216
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,016
Uh, spare overalls and gloves.
Oh, do you have a pair of boots?

217
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,020
- Uh, these.
- We'll see what we can find.

218
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:21,890
Isobel,

219
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,390
this is Maya.

220
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:25,727
I told you about her,
she'll be training with us.

221
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,362
- Maya, Isobel.
- Hi.

222
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,933
Waters and soda in the cooler.

223
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,770
Uh, Browns Bakery
delivers sandwiches.

224
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,906
Put money in the honor jar
and...

225
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:42,342
Oh, if you want anything special
they can make it for you.

226
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,045
Oh, here's Xavier
for his sugar hit.

227
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:46,781
Xavier, this is Maya.

228
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,282
Welcome aboard.

229
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,686
Uh... this is Maggie.

230
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:54,221
Oh, at the end of the day
if you need to clean up,

231
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,723
there's a washroom.

232
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:57,291
This is a tool rack.

233
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,461
Oh, we have
a few cultural differences

234
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,396
that may take you
a little while to get used to.

235
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,533
For example, this is a riddle.

236
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,202
Oh, this is a hoe

237
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:12,139
and there are in fact
38 different kinds of hoes.

238
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,776
And how many kinds of riddles?

239
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,612
Well, that is
what we're about to find out.

240
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:23,417
Why don't you get changed
and... I'll see you in a bit.

241
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,398
Now, all of these plants here

242
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:42,202
are raised on an organic mix
of elements like perlite,

243
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,338
coconut coir, sphagnum moss.

244
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:48,208
But when combined with soil
it creates loam,

245
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,246
and loam is the best kind
of growing soil.

246
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,381
Now, I have a sample.

247
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,085
Uh, take your gloves off.

248
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:02,624
And I want you to pick it up.

249
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:07,294
Grab a handful and squeeze it.

250
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,367
And smell it.

251
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:20,608
And really smell it, come on.

252
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,310
Kiss it.

253
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,146
Really smell it.

254
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,120
Oh! And what do you smell?

255
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,421
Animal?

256
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,456
Mineral?

257
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,492
Vegetable?

258
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,062
Hmm. All three.

259
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:45,332
Now, 70 years ago
the soil in this area

260
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,302
was depleted
by industrial farming

261
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,404
and in order to fix it,
they added fertilizer.

262
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:53,273
And guess what?
It made it worse.

263
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:55,208
Come on, smell it again.

264
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,445
Get in there.
Come on, don't be afraid.

265
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:28,743
That's a filthy habit, Mr. Roth.

266
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,614
I allow myself one per day.

267
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,518
- See you tomorrow.
- Yep.

268
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,470
What is it?

269
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,445
She's doing okay, isn't she?

270
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,516
Seems to be.

271
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,885
Young people, who knows?

272
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,554
Has Norma met her?

273
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:51,191
Why not?
Doesn't that seem strange?

274
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:53,193
It's her land.

275
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,829
Her garden.

276
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:56,964
Her grandniece.

277
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,004
You know,

278
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,841
people used to walk on the soil.

279
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,879
Now they just walk
on tar and concrete...

280
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,982
wearing rubber soles.

281
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:20,722
They used to sleep
on the land...

282
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,558
and there was an exchange...

283
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,995
and that was a healing process.

284
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,732
You amaze me
when you get romantic like this.

285
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:45,278
<i>The nandina is a species</i>
<i>of flowering plant</i>

286
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,414
<i>native to Eastern Asia.</i>

287
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,157
<i>The smell at certain times</i>
<i>of the year is minty,</i>

288
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,692
<i>with a hint of almond.</i>

289
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,994
<i>It gives you a real buzz.</i>

290
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,598
<i>Like the buzz you get</i>

291
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:06,299
<i>just before pulling</i>
<i>the trigger.</i>

292
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:11,739
<i>Gardening is the most</i>
<i>accessible of the arts.</i>

293
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,440
<i>It's already there.</i>

294
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:17,578
<i>Every seed is a plant,</i>
<i>waiting to be unlocked.</i>

295
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:21,582
<i>It was commonly thought</i>
<i>that 150 years</i>

296
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,618
<i>was the lifetime of a seed.</i>

297
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:27,722
<i>In the 1950s,</i>
<i>a Japanese botanist</i>

298
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:32,093
<i>discovered viable lotus seeds</i>
<i>in an Ice Age lakebed.</i>

299
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,763
<i>A substantial portion</i>
<i>were germinated.</i>

300
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:41,536
<i>It is now believed</i>
<i>that the lifetime of a seed</i>

301
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:45,807
<i>is between 850 and 1,250 years.</i>

302
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:53,815
<i>Given the right conditions,</i>
<i>seeds can last indefinitely.</i>

303
00:22:00,855 --> 00:22:03,524
<i>I wear mine on my skin</i>
<i>every day.</i>

304
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:24,011
All right,
special announcement.

305
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:30,350
Listen up,
I would like to raise a cup...

306
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,520
to Maya.

307
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:34,487
- Maya!
- Two weeks in our...

308
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:35,890
...special little community.

309
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:37,390
To Maya.

310
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:38,826
I hope we haven't made

311
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,662
- life too hard on you.
- Thank you, everyone.

312
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:44,464
Thank you.

313
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,338
Ow!

314
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:03,050
<i>Then she gave me a book.</i>

315
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:06,087
<i>It was about gardens.</i>

316
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,525
<i>"What am I supposed to do</i>
<i>with this?" I said.</i>

317
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,929
<i>"Read it," she said.</i>

318
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:44,025
- Thank you, Janine.
- Narvel.

319
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,037
Thank you.

320
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,579
Would you like a water or tea?

321
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:07,381
- I'll tell Ronnie.
- Oh, I'm not...

322
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,749
How about a Manhattan?

323
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:10,551
Ronnie makes one
where he gets a syringe

324
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,086
and shoots
a little cherry Cointreau

325
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,387
into the maraschino.

326
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:14,689
The Missus loves it.

327
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:17,224
Oh, that sounds
like just the ticket.

328
00:24:39,213 --> 00:24:40,181
Mr. Roth.

329
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:42,616
Ronnie.

330
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:53,761
You clean up real nice,
Sweet Pea.

331
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:55,563
I've always said that.

332
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:57,865
Thank you.

333
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:02,003
Ronnie uses a syringe to shoot
the maraschinos with Cointreau.

334
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,705
It's delicious.

335
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,507
Janine said that.

336
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,976
So, how is she doing?

337
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,946
Uh, who?

338
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,081
Who do you think?

339
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,851
It took you long enough to ask.

340
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:20,154
So, how is she doing?

341
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:21,789
Quite well.

342
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,092
I think she's surprised

343
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,894
that you haven't come
to visit her yet.

344
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,997
Sometimes you have
to wait them out.

345
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:34,201
Well,
perhaps you could reconsider.

346
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:38,906
How much research did you do
before you took her on?

347
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,912
Huh. As I thought.

348
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:47,715
I didn't do much on you, either.

349
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:51,719
Hmm. She's an apprentice.

350
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,721
You were an apprentice once.

351
00:25:55,156 --> 00:25:56,123
Is she smart?

352
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:58,959
Yes.

353
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,495
More than I could say
about her mother.

354
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,201
Dinner is ready.

355
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,977
I had something on my mind
when I invited you.

356
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:19,213
I imagined.

357
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:21,015
That was delicious.

358
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,250
This year's Charity Auction.

359
00:26:23,984 --> 00:26:26,687
- I want it to be special.
- It will be.

360
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,523
It may be the last.

361
00:26:29,023 --> 00:26:31,826
I'm having some...
health issues.

362
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,427
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

363
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,763
No, no, it's not like that,
but...

364
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,265
the effort it takes, it's...

365
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,036
Perhaps next year,
I might not be up to it.

366
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,772
Well, you're strong.

367
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,844
And if I'm not?

368
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:55,149
Well, Norma,

369
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,620
then it will be the darndest
Charity Gala you've ever thrown.

370
00:27:02,189 --> 00:27:04,625
I've made some preparations.

371
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,362
- Yeah?
- Sweet Pea...

372
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,364
are you listening?

373
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:14,503
I don't want to repeat myself.
I get... forgetful.

374
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,137
That is not true.

375
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,372
I'm listening, go ahead.

376
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:21,208
Some preparations
with the estate managers

377
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:22,409
and legal team.

378
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:25,580
The main house
and some ancillary properties

379
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:26,914
will be sold off.

380
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,118
The Trust will ensure
the gardens in perpetuity

381
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:33,154
and you will have

382
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:36,591
a yearly income
and control of the gardens.

383
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:37,958
And when the time comes,

384
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,761
you will designate
your successor.

385
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:44,765
I leave this thing
I have inherited and maintained,

386
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,968
I leave it in your hands.

387
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,404
I'm honored,

388
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:54,108
but I think that I will beat you
out the door.

389
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:56,511
It would be nice

390
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,345
if the gardens remained
in the family.

391
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:01,081
Do you think she's up to it?

392
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:05,352
That is a question
only you can ask.

393
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,455
I think
that you should meet with her.

394
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:11,025
- Set that up.
- Hmm.

395
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:14,361
Now... take me to bed.

396
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,292
You first.

397
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,761
Let me see it.

398
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,295
<i>Fire!</i>

399
00:29:56,063 --> 00:29:57,699
What happened to Johnny Boy?

400
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,235
Was like a son to me.

401
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,871
He's been talking to the Feds.

402
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:05,774
Trust me on this one.

403
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,875
I want you to handle it.

404
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,877
Uh-huh.

405
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,290
Now we're just looking
for a good spot...

406
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,527
- Mm-hmm.
- ...with the shovel.

407
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,631
- Can I get a pansy?
- Yeah.

408
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,298
Here you go.

409
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:37,304
And you just mix it
with the new soil...

410
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,239
and...

411
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,009
Nice.

412
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:43,611
That's easy enough.

413
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,218
- Oh, here comes Ms. Haverhill.
- Okay.

414
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:56,357
Maya.

415
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,460
- I'm Norma Haverhill.
- Hi.

416
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:02,496
I like your outfit.

417
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:05,567
I was wondering
if you needed any help.

418
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,168
We were, um...
It's under control.

419
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:11,438
Well, it's lunchtime.
Perhaps we could get a snack.

420
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,575
I don't have
anything prepared.

421
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,075
We'll use the lunch room.

422
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:24,519
Narvel mentioned that you
had expected me to come by.

423
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,954
That's on me.

424
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:28,757
I apologize.

425
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:32,359
I'm an old woman and sometimes
I forget what's proper.

426
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,364
Did you order this?

427
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:42,670
No.

428
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,139
It is less than suitable.

429
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,274
Hmm...

430
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:50,377
We could go to the main house
and Ronnie could whip us up a...

431
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:52,680
Oh, no, it's okay, thank you.

432
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,517
I'm a very simple person.

433
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:58,385
There's a lot to be said
for that.

434
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:01,790
In the greenhouses,
we're working

435
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,659
with Cleome Senorita Rosalitas.

436
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,895
- Already?
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:08,596
Such a beautiful flower.

438
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:10,832
And when the white sheds
to purple...

439
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:12,132
It needs to be deadheaded.

440
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,067
It channels the energy
to the flowers

441
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:15,503
instead of the seeds.

442
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:24,144
Do you remember me?

443
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,415
Yeah, of course.

444
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:31,118
And your mother?

445
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,193
Um, yeah. Yes.

446
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:42,496
Did she talk about me?

447
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:44,465
Yeah.

448
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,409
Do you wanna hear this?

449
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,780
- Sorry?
- Do you wanna hear this?

450
00:32:58,913 --> 00:33:00,147
Um...

451
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:03,150
I got dressed for garden work,

452
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,487
walked over here,
I invited you to lunch,

453
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,590
I trusted you to Narvel.

454
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,526
Of course I want to hear
what you have to say.

455
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,161
There's nothing
I want to hear more.

456
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,731
Hmm.

457
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:20,334
Well, she was conflicted.

458
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:25,439
She felt
that you thought she was...

459
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:29,309
um... inadequate.

460
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:32,580
She thought that?

461
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,049
Yes.

462
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,920
You need to remember
she wasn't my child.

463
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,321
She was my sister's child.

464
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:43,591
But her name was Norma.

465
00:33:44,258 --> 00:33:46,260
Her mother named her after you.

466
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,562
Betty, my sister,

467
00:33:47,695 --> 00:33:49,631
didn't ask my permission
to do that.

468
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,534
I thought it was...

469
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:54,268
presumptuous.

470
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:57,872
Or maybe
she wanted to obligate you.

471
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:00,474
I believe
that was her point.

472
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,810
Because she was inadequate.

473
00:34:03,912 --> 00:34:05,547
I'm not sure I like that tone.

474
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:10,518
I gave your mother
everything I could.

475
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,588
My sister
couldn't give her enough.

476
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:16,390
Whatever it was,
it wasn't enough.

477
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,893
She couldn't weed her garden.

478
00:34:19,126 --> 00:34:20,828
And how could you
have known that?

479
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:22,897
There are things you know

480
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,866
in your flesh,

481
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:28,068
your nostrils, your eyes...

482
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,973
Listen to me.

483
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:34,709
I came here for a pleasant lunch

484
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:37,545
and here we are
in the muck of the past.

485
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,147
It is a muck farm.

486
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:45,553
And I'm sorry if I offended you.

487
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:49,156
But I'm not inadequate.

488
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,759
No, of course you're not.

489
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:54,596
You are impertinent.

490
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:06,373
And don't think for a second
about leaving Gracewood Gardens.

491
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:45,113
<i>Overnight,</i>
<i>black aphids appeared</i>

492
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:48,315
<i>growing on the tips</i>
<i>of the Dropmore scarlet.</i>

493
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:53,220
<i>It was all hands on board</i>
<i>to spray a mix of neem oil,</i>

494
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:55,389
<i>karanja oil, and pure soap</i>

495
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:58,258
<i>to stop the outbreak</i>
<i>in its tracks.</i>

496
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:13,608
<i>I've never thought too much</i>
<i>about women,</i>

497
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,209
<i>other than as women.</i>

498
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:25,218
<i>I'm not sure what it is</i>
<i>about these two women,</i>

499
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,387
<i>Norma and her grandniece.</i>

500
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,957
<i>I'm not sure I want to know.</i>

501
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:39,067
Binomial nomenclature.

502
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:42,537
Each country, culture,
has thousands of plants.

503
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,272
And all those plants
have multiple names

504
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,708
in multiple languages.

505
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:50,444
How were horticulturists
supposed to agree

506
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:53,648
on the name
for a tree or a flower?

507
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:58,186
Uh, 1700s, Carl Linné
had an idea.

508
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:01,055
Why not use
a dead language, Latin,

509
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,457
that everybody could agree upon?

510
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:05,927
As a result, he changed his name

511
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:09,731
to Carl... Linnaeus.

512
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:14,769
Now binomial is two words,
just like human names.

513
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:18,338
So, <i>Rosa rubiginosa,</i>
that's a rose.

514
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,775
Uh, sweet briar rose.

515
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:23,945
Take me, for example.

516
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:27,849
Roth is my genus, or category,

517
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:31,552
and Narvel is my specific name.

518
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:35,189
Now Roth means red, or <i>Rothum.</i>

519
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,925
So, if I were a <i>Rothum,</i>

520
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,529
people might say,
"Well, which of the reds is he?"

521
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:45,767
And somebody might say,
"Well, he's the one who stinks,"

522
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,202
and then I would be...

523
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:51,706
<i>Rothum foetidum</i> or
Stinking Red.

524
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,942
So, if you heard <i>Rothum foetidum</i>
you would know

525
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,712
that people
were talking about me.

526
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:00,748
That is, if people
were thinking about me.

527
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:03,184
And what makes you so sure

528
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:04,919
people aren't thinking
about you?

529
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:16,864
I heard that Norma
stopped by for lunch.

530
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:19,934
Word travels fast.

531
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:24,071
That kind of word does.
Uh, what did she say?

532
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,073
She gave me a raise.

533
00:38:29,177 --> 00:38:30,310
She walked out on you.

534
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,980
And she gave me a raise.

535
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,686
You walk a line, Maya.

536
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:41,354
I walk a line.

537
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:43,658
Norma walks a line.

538
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:45,960
And you walk a line.

539
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,329
Be careful.

540
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:53,868
Hmm.

541
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:30,738
Mr. Roth?

542
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,373
- What's up?
- Maya's injured.

543
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:36,110
She said not to tell you,
but I think you should come.

544
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:37,778
Yeah. H... hold on.

545
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm... I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have come.

546
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:02,036
No, nonsense.

547
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,173
Should I call 911?

548
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:08,309
Janine, I leave that up to you.

549
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:09,911
Yeah, I'm not sure.

550
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:13,080
If she does go,
she'll have a drug test.

551
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:16,617
We could take care of her here.

552
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,021
Maya.

553
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:25,259
We're going to clean you up
here, fix you up.

554
00:40:25,393 --> 00:40:26,527
Get you some rest

555
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,529
and see how you feel
in a few hours.

556
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,467
I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

557
00:40:34,602 --> 00:40:36,804
Hey, we're your family now.

558
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:39,173
You did the right thing to come.

559
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,810
You're safe, all right?
You're safe here.

560
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:57,024
Well, frankly, I think Norma's
a little tickled by it.

561
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:00,628
Not much happens
at Gracewood Gardens.

562
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:05,032
Well, it's a little
too much drama for me.

563
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:20,681
How are you feeling?

564
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:23,818
Good. Better, really.

565
00:41:24,418 --> 00:41:26,921
Come tomorrow morning,
it's going to hurt.

566
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:32,259
Well, I'm ready to get back
to work.

567
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,565
Want to give us a minute?

568
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:41,168
Xavier, I need some help
with the replanting.

569
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,095
Maya,

570
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:11,198
I'm not a man to pry
into other people's lives.

571
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:15,803
I'm certainly not a man
to want people to pry into mine.

572
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:19,774
The situation here
is a little different.

573
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:25,079
We take pride in our young staff
at Gracewood.

574
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,884
When they succeed, we feel good.

575
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:35,122
And when they get drunk
or post a sexist meme,

576
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,957
well, that hurts us.

577
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,627
But when they get beat up...

578
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:43,898
that really bothers us.

579
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,204
So, you wanna get rid of me?

580
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:52,673
Absolutely not.

581
00:42:54,442 --> 00:42:56,210
No, we want to be of help.

582
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,223
Are you satisfied with the life
that you have?

583
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:20,668
Who did this to you?

584
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:22,504
Your boyfriend?

585
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,271
He's not my boyfriend.

586
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,041
RG.

587
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:31,245
- Oh, he tells you what to do?
- Oh, he's a dealer.

588
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:33,814
RG what?

589
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:40,054
He was my mom's dealer.

590
00:43:41,388 --> 00:43:44,692
After she died,
I ran errands for him.

591
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:45,926
He liked the fact

592
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,962
that I could pass
in fancy hotels.

593
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:50,030
And what happened?

594
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:56,370
He didn't like my attitude.

595
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,407
He'd been up all night,

596
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,843
didn't like the way
that I smelled.

597
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:05,012
He said he knew
where I was going

598
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:07,047
and he'd beat me if I came back.

599
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,651
And then what happened?

600
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:12,987
He did.

601
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:23,397
I think it best if you stay
at Gracewood tonight.

602
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,034
I'm going to talk to Isobel.

603
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:29,403
Yeah.

604
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:34,909
Gomez.

605
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:39,713
Robbie Gomez.

606
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,051
All right.

607
00:44:46,487 --> 00:44:47,721
Wait here.

608
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:51,959
I'll, uh, go check on it.

609
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:07,875
Ms. H?

610
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:10,744
Maya was injured.

611
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:12,647
I noticed.

612
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,215
I get reports.

613
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:17,117
She's okay now,
but I think it best

614
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,220
if she stayed
at Gracewood tonight.

615
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:21,989
Why doesn't she ask?

616
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:26,093
Because I'm asking.

617
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:31,432
Did you hear about the way
she talked to me?

618
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,334
I'm asking.

619
00:45:34,636 --> 00:45:35,936
She'll figure it out.

620
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:38,239
We all have to make our own way.

621
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:41,108
You figured it out.

622
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:44,178
You were patient with me.

623
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,482
Sweet Pea.

624
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:52,853
I have to catch up
on things tonight.

625
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:56,123
Next week, then.

626
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:27,087
This is really sweet.
Thanks, Janine.

627
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,929
<i>I have created this life.</i>

628
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:42,169
<i>Filled it with rules.</i>

629
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,376
<i>Now seems the time</i>
<i>to break one.</i>

630
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:53,947
Deputy Marshal Neruda?
Narvel Roth.

631
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:57,418
<i>- Were we meeting in...</i>
- Three months.

632
00:46:58,252 --> 00:46:59,587
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

633
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:03,123
Well, something's come up and...

634
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:08,095
I wanted to meet in person,
if possible.

635
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:10,931
The same place?

636
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,300
<i>Tots is still standing.</i>

637
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:14,868
<i>They put a Starbucks</i>
<i>down the block, but yeah.</i>

638
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:17,838
Yeah. Uh, 9:00 a.m.?

639
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:20,341
<i>That works.</i>

640
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:10,224
- Early as usual.
- Force of habit. Sit.

641
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,094
It's good to see you.

642
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:16,130
Want anything?

643
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,633
- Uh...
- Over here.

644
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:20,267
Uh, coffee.

645
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:23,303
Yeah, and I'll have a toasted
bran muffin with butter.

646
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,139
Same.

647
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,515
So, how's my old crowd?

648
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:34,849
Dead, mostly.

649
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,619
Yeah, prison will do that
to a person.

650
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:40,889
Old Man finally croaked
last year.

651
00:48:41,388 --> 00:48:43,591
A couple still hanging
by their diapers.

652
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:45,993
Potty Patlo's got dementia.

653
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:47,327
Johnny Boy.

654
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,206
Fucking Jeremiah.

655
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:04,445
Reverend Charles.

656
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:07,080
Reverend Charles Avery.

657
00:49:07,214 --> 00:49:09,316
Oh, that nigger
has it out for me.

658
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,619
He needs to vanish.

659
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,187
<i>Don't leave any witnesses.</i>

660
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,421
Wait, wait, wait.

661
00:49:28,368 --> 00:49:30,437
Yeah, I remember.

662
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,139
Thought you would.

663
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:35,710
So much for... memory lane.

664
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,177
Lot of hits.

665
00:49:37,879 --> 00:49:39,046
Fourteen indictments.

666
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,715
Two years in court.

667
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:41,883
You flipped.

668
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:43,785
You broke up the band.

669
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,320
So, am I in the clear?

670
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:48,489
That's never going to happen.

671
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:52,092
You're a known guy.

672
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:54,228
You put the deep six
on nine bad guys.

673
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:57,264
I mean, even if they're dead,
you're not forgotten.

674
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:59,166
Every skinhead punk

675
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:00,568
wants to make
a name for himself,

676
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:04,271
move up, just gotta say,
"I found Norton Rupplea,

677
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:05,874
and I took him out."

678
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,307
Instant cred.

679
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:09,009
No, my friend.

680
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:12,680
You're never going to be
Norton Rupplea again.

681
00:50:14,582 --> 00:50:17,484
My driver's license expires
in a few months.

682
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:19,721
I'll take care of it.

683
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:25,192
Uh, you got something
on your mind?

684
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:30,197
It concerns where I work.

685
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,734
You've done a terrific job.

686
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,068
Actually, I'm impressed.

687
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,574
You know, I wish for both
of our sakes we can go public.

688
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,910
You're a WITSEC poster boy.

689
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,143
If I had a little gold star,

690
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:44,444
I'd put it on your
fucking forehead

691
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,146
right now.

692
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:49,651
There's a young woman.

693
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:52,854
Works as an apprentice
at the gardens.

694
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:56,056
And the owner feels
an obligation to her.

695
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:57,992
She took a beating.

696
00:50:58,826 --> 00:51:01,461
She was involved in drugs,
maybe a mule.

697
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,363
So, where do I come in?

698
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:07,535
- Uh, she has a boyfriend.
- Hmm.

699
00:51:08,201 --> 00:51:10,203
Robbie Gomez, birthname.

700
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:14,274
Piece of shit. His crew work out
of the 9th Street Projects.

701
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,110
I was wondering
if you could pull up his name

702
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:18,713
on that databank of yours
and see.

703
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:21,281
There's gotta...
gotta be a rap sheet.

704
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:23,651
All right.

705
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:29,657
Oh, yeah.

706
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:31,091
Here we go.

707
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:32,594
- Oh, he's been busy.
- Hmm.

708
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:35,162
So, what's going on?

709
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,531
I would like someone,

710
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:38,198
not me of course,
uh, it's too risky,

711
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:39,934
but someone from law enforcement

712
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:42,971
to pay RG a knock and talk.

713
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:46,406
Tell him they heard stories
about the way he treats women,

714
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:48,475
one case in particular.

715
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,045
Tell him
they got their eye on him

716
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:53,280
and if they hear
any more such stories,

717
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,049
he's going to be
the first person they visit.

718
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:58,352
And obviously they've got
more reasons to visit him.

719
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,822
You asking me a favor?

720
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:04,792
I guess so, yeah.

721
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,629
Well, I think you've earned it.

722
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:10,598
I'll take care of it.

723
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,132
Great, thank you.

724
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:13,467
All right.

725
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:15,803
So what, you're retiring?
When are you retiring?

726
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:17,872
Hundred and two days.

727
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:21,375
You'll be assigned
a new case agent.

728
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:24,144
Hmm.

729
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,248
All right, maybe
we could meet up after that.

730
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:31,619
No, Narvel.

731
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:33,420
That's just not possible.

732
00:52:35,723 --> 00:52:36,758
Yeah.

733
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:39,861
All right.

734
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,670
Good morning.

735
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:56,243
Hmm, very good.

736
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:58,445
Coming along nicely.

737
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:02,583
Hey.

738
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:04,251
- How's it going?
- Good.

739
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:07,254
You all right? Oh.

740
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:14,327
Uh... Norma has invited you
to lunch

741
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:16,864
at the house, tomorrow.

742
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:19,901
Uh, I thought
she didn't like me.

743
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,537
Oh, she has her own things
going on.

744
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,305
Hmm. And what will I wear?

745
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:29,877
Uh, that is a question
for Isobel.

746
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:41,923
I'm looking
into this situation with RG.

747
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,423
I left a message with someone.

748
00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:45,760
- Who?
- Someone I know.

749
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:48,228
Someone you know?

750
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:50,765
Someone I used to know.

751
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,301
<i>She talked about her life.</i>

752
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:57,004
<i>There's something</i>
<i>missing in her.</i>

753
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:59,173
<i>Something vital fell out</i>

754
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,408
<i>and something took its place.</i>

755
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:03,945
Maya, do you take drugs?

756
00:54:05,146 --> 00:54:08,549
- Why would you ask that?
- It's a simple question.

757
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:11,986
Yeah.

758
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:13,554
So what?

759
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:15,489
Often?

760
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:18,760
No, I don't have a drug problem.

761
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:23,263
But somebody does.

762
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:25,533
When did you shoot up?

763
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:31,873
- You're reaching now.
- You started it.

764
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:36,778
Let's go back.

765
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:41,015
<i>It's so simple when it begins.</i>

766
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:43,618
<i>You don't ask why.</i>

767
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:46,554
<i>You forget how it started.</i>

768
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:49,924
<i>One day leads to the next.</i>

769
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:55,295
<i>The seeds of love grow,</i>
<i>like the seeds of hate.</i>

770
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:07,708
Maya?

771
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:10,978
Come in.

772
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:16,316
- Hey.
- Hey.

773
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:18,418
Everything all right?

774
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:20,922
Yeah, good.

775
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:24,225
Uh...

776
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:28,361
So, I spoke
to a couple of people, and...

777
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:31,398
it should be safe for you
to go back to your place

778
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:32,834
in a couple of days.

779
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,040
Uh, and...

780
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,876
this is for you
to wear to lunch tomorrow.

781
00:55:44,879 --> 00:55:47,380
- You all right?
- Uh, yeah.

782
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:48,749
Sorry.

783
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:50,618
Isobel got me this?

784
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:55,523
Uh, Norma wanted
to pick something out for you.

785
00:55:58,793 --> 00:55:59,827
Oh.

786
00:56:01,162 --> 00:56:02,429
Um...

787
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:05,533
Thank you.

788
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:08,069
Thank Norma.

789
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,043
Hey, hey.

790
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,979
Sorry.

791
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,925
Uh, no, no.

792
00:56:31,993 --> 00:56:33,094
Sorry.

793
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:36,463
Uh, don't do that.

794
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,361
It looks good.

795
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,665
- Charles did a good job.
- He always does.

796
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:14,135
- Has he sent it out?
- Waiting on your approval.

797
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:15,536
He has it.

798
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:20,308
You're looking stunning
in that dress. Did I say that?

799
00:57:20,641 --> 00:57:22,376
Uh, yes. Thank you.

800
00:57:22,777 --> 00:57:24,545
Good enough to be on television.

801
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:28,316
You know, I was on television.
Did you know that?

802
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,351
Well, you're too young
to remember,

803
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,920
but Westerns were all the craze.

804
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:34,622
<i>The Rifleman.</i>

805
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:36,691
It was a father and son show,

806
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:39,860
was on the same time every week.

807
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:42,763
Tuesday, nine o'clock.

808
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,601
And, um...

809
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:49,303
Oh, God,

810
00:57:49,804 --> 00:57:51,906
Johnny Crawford
was the cutest boy

811
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,107
I'd ever seen.

812
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:55,710
He was once a Mouseketeer.

813
00:57:57,712 --> 00:57:59,680
I bet you don't know
what that is.

814
00:58:00,214 --> 00:58:02,249
Oh...

815
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:07,088
Father had taken me
to Los Angeles on business.

816
00:58:07,688 --> 00:58:09,690
He knew the people
who did the show

817
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:13,995
and they needed a little girl
to give Johnny a flower.

818
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:16,897
Do you know
who that little girl was?

819
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,668
- You.
- Right.

820
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:24,839
They filmed it three times.

821
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:27,408
Father had all his friends
come to the house

822
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,076
to see the show when it aired.

823
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:30,711
Right here.

824
00:58:31,746 --> 00:58:33,581
Oh, I'm sure
you can see it somewhere.

825
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,282
Probably on the internet.

826
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:38,753
I hate the internet.

827
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:41,222
Yeah, you hardly use it.

828
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:43,124
Before cell phone cameras,

829
00:58:43,257 --> 00:58:46,427
if you did something,
it was your word against theirs.

830
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:48,262
Now if you do something,

831
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:50,131
your friends just record it
and put it on the internet.

832
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:53,701
Oh, I bet there's some juicy
pictures of you on the web.

833
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:00,574
Norma, stop that.

834
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:04,178
- Stop what?
- You know what.

835
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:05,880
I hear things.

836
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:08,315
What? What things?

837
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,719
Is that you talking,
or your dick?

838
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:15,556
You don't think I see?

839
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,092
You think you can
run around the backyard

840
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:20,127
in the middle of the night
pulling your pants up,

841
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,997
after paying a little visit
to this one here?

842
00:59:30,204 --> 00:59:33,207
Ah. Well, guess it runs
in the blood.

843
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:37,044
Just like her mother.

844
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,652
Norma, you asked me
to look out for her.

845
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:46,287
Yeah, but I didn't think
you were going to be

846
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,356
Humbert Humbert in your
own production of <i>Lolita.</i>

847
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:50,958
Maya's just finding her own way.

848
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:53,761
And I'm the fucking
Queen of Scotland!

849
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:05,806
- You should apologize.
- To the slut?

850
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:08,709
- Janine! Ronnie!
- You, too.

851
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:11,479
- For what?
- I want you gone.

852
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:12,746
I warned you.

853
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,549
I don't want you
around here anymore.

854
01:00:14,682 --> 01:00:15,850
Just calm down.

855
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:19,386
Tonight. I want you out tonight.

856
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,757
We'll talk tomorrow.

857
01:00:24,758 --> 01:00:28,262
Mr. Oscar Neruda.

858
01:00:28,796 --> 01:00:30,397
That's who I'll talk to.

859
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:33,267
I remember
when he asked me to help.

860
01:00:34,603 --> 01:00:36,437
He said you were a special case.

861
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,075
As you wish.

862
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:45,880
Norma, I want to thank you.

863
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,281
For what?

864
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,118
For having faith in me.

865
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,359
I thought you had a green thumb.

866
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:02,129
I didn't know
it was a green middle finger.

867
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:23,884
<i>This was the time.</i>

868
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,887
<i>The time I had been</i>
<i>waiting for.</i>

869
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:34,395
Just give me a second.

870
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:38,732
It's Narvel, Maya.

871
01:01:46,173 --> 01:01:48,842
Yeah, okay. Come in.

872
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:04,191
She, uh, wants you to leave.

873
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:08,697
In fact,
she wants us both to leave.

874
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:09,997
Now.

875
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:11,799
Is she serious?

876
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:14,768
Oh, yeah, I think so.

877
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,073
- Can she even do that?
- It's her estate.

878
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:21,942
The gardens belong to her.

879
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:23,911
So, we're leaving.

880
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:28,315
So, do I have to go back?

881
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,555
Uh, well...

882
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,223
Uh...

883
01:02:39,193 --> 01:02:41,095
You're welcome to stick with me.

884
01:02:43,397 --> 01:02:44,798
If you trust me.

885
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:47,167
Can you do that?

886
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:56,277
I have to grab a few things
from my place.

887
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:58,412
Yeah.

888
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,586
Fuck!
That's him, that's RG.

889
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:05,819
- Where?
- Just...

890
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:07,254
The one in the red.

891
01:03:07,888 --> 01:03:09,823
The other one's Sissy.

892
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,340
I'm just here on the left,
just one block.

893
01:03:39,621 --> 01:03:40,755
Wait, I'll come with you.

894
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:42,389
No, it's okay, I'm good.

895
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:45,893
I'll wait.

896
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:04,612
<i>Yeah?</i>

897
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:18,125
<i>- Yeah, who's this?</i>
- Where are you?

898
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:20,861
<i>Hold your fucking horses!</i>
<i>I'm coming.</i>

899
01:05:00,802 --> 01:05:02,069
Hey.

900
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,739
I'm looking for someone.

901
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:07,474
Are you the one
they call Frito the Beaner?

902
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:09,443
- That what they say?
- Now, what the fuck?

903
01:05:09,577 --> 01:05:12,913
Oh, must have got
the wrong information.

904
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:14,481
You I know.

905
01:05:15,149 --> 01:05:16,718
You're the one they call RG.

906
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:20,387
You're the one that got some
good advice the other day.

907
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:22,055
Yeah.

908
01:05:22,356 --> 01:05:26,193
And you must be Farmer John.

909
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,295
I'm a gardener.

910
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,031
That's why I wear
these funny clothes

911
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:35,603
and carry these pruning shears
as part of my job.

912
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:38,840
You know, pruning shears,
they can snap off a branch

913
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:41,676
or a plant bulb just like that.

914
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,546
Same time it takes
to snap off a finger

915
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:46,046
or some testicles.

916
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,584
Hey, Sissy,
think twice before you move.

917
01:05:51,285 --> 01:05:53,588
I've done a lot of pruning
in my life.

918
01:05:54,823 --> 01:05:55,824
RG?

919
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,292
You got a visit from the police.

920
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:01,228
I'm the second warning.

921
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:11,104
Hey, chill, Proud Boy!

922
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:01,623
How are you feeling?

923
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:03,457
Good.

924
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:05,158
Pretty high, huh?

925
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:09,329
All right, whatever it is,

926
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:11,331
take it out
and put it on the ground.

927
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:16,303
Check your socks,
your waistband, and your duffel.

928
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:20,742
What, you want me to do it?

929
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:24,244
Huh?

930
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,783
Fucking Christ!

931
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:53,500
<i>The lavender sage</i>
<i>and plum poppies</i>

932
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:55,803
<i>bloom the same time every year</i>

933
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:58,305
<i>but never quite the same way.</i>

934
01:08:59,373 --> 01:09:01,542
<i>Some years</i>
<i>they are in giddy harmony,</i>

935
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:05,212
<i>other years they barely</i>
<i>tolerate each other.</i>

936
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,803
Let me tell you how this
is going to work, Maya.

937
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:31,939
Fuck you.

938
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:34,742
You're feeling bad now,

939
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:37,477
but your system will adjust.

940
01:09:38,378 --> 01:09:39,446
Piece of shit.

941
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:42,282
I would like you to go
to the bathroom now

942
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:43,818
and shower and change. It's...

943
01:09:44,217 --> 01:09:46,621
<i>it's very important</i>
<i>that you stay hydrated.</i>

944
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:54,428
<i>Narcotics Anonymous</i>

945
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,496
<i>is a fellowship of</i>
<i>men and women</i>

946
01:09:56,631 --> 01:09:58,966

947
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:01,301
<i>We are a nonprofit society</i>

01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,938
<i>and have no dues or fees</i>

949
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:06,406
I'm Narvel,

950
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:08,142
I'm a drug addict.

951
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:10,545
- Welcome, Narvel.
- Thank you.

952
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:13,047
I'm Maya,

953
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:14,782
I'm a drug addict.

954
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:16,684
Welcome, Maya.

955
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:32,834
<i>I found a life in flowers.</i>

956
01:10:33,467 --> 01:10:35,435
<i>How unlikely is that?</i>

957
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:50,985
<i>I'm not leaving until I say</i>
<i>goodbye to my daughter.</i>

958
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,087
Now where are they?

959
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,722
She doesn't want
to talk to you.

960
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:57,024
She's had time
to think about your beliefs.

961
01:10:57,158 --> 01:10:58,425
She doesn't share them.

962
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:01,428
Yeah, all right.
What about Annie?

963
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:04,031
You know, she's five years old.

964
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:07,602
Your wife told her that you
were killed in an accident.

965
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,940
Hey. I... I did everything
that you asked me to do.

966
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:17,812
And now you've testified,
you'll be relocated.

967
01:11:19,147 --> 01:11:20,815
Time to start a new life, pal.

968
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:44,906
How are you feeling?

969
01:11:45,273 --> 01:11:46,541
I'm shaky.

970
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,677
But pretty good.

971
01:11:54,882 --> 01:11:57,718
You know I wasn't really
a drug addict, right?

972
01:11:57,852 --> 01:12:00,955
Oh, no, no,
I didn't think you were.

973
01:12:01,088 --> 01:12:03,057
But if you know any
and they come along,

974
01:12:03,191 --> 01:12:04,659
there's a barf bag in the back.

975
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:07,762
'Cause...

976
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,667
Yeah. Go on and smirk,
Mr. Smirk.

977
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:16,336
But if I needed a barf bag,
I would have brought my own,

978
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:18,438
and that's not the case.

979
01:12:19,307 --> 01:12:21,341
So, thank you but no thank you.

980
01:12:21,474 --> 01:12:23,277
<i>My daughter's 13 now.</i>

981
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:27,048
You know, if... if at any point
that she wanted to see me,

982
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:30,350
- reach out, can she do that?
- Doesn't work that way.

983
01:12:30,885 --> 01:12:33,554
And if you attempt to go around
the Marshals Service and...

984
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:35,156
contact her directly,

985
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:37,024
you'll only endanger her.

986
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:39,694
Where are they?

987
01:12:40,194 --> 01:12:41,428
I don't know.

988
01:12:42,263 --> 01:12:43,564
I don't want to know.

989
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:47,869
Have you ever been
to Great Dixter?

990
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,340
- Great Dixter?
- Yeah, I've been reading.

991
01:12:52,707 --> 01:12:55,576
Dixter is... is a long way
from here.

992
01:12:56,277 --> 01:12:58,846
London. England. Whatever.

993
01:12:59,947 --> 01:13:00,982
Someday, maybe.

994
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,417
You could take me.

995
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:26,841
I thought
you already had one today.

996
01:13:27,341 --> 01:13:28,576
Well...

997
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:33,147
you get a second
if you go to a meeting.

998
01:13:34,982 --> 01:13:37,385
- That's the 13th step.
- Right.

999
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:41,488
You know
you talk a lot of shit, but...

1000
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:44,592
there's one thing
you don't talk about.

1001
01:13:45,726 --> 01:13:46,994
What's that?

1002
01:13:48,663 --> 01:13:49,897
Yourself.

1003
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:53,433
Well,
there's not much to know.

1004
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:56,537
Were you ever married?

1005
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,977
I was, a long time ago.

1006
01:14:12,086 --> 01:14:13,154
What happened?

1007
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:16,489
Didn't work.

1008
01:14:21,996 --> 01:14:23,030
Any kids?

1009
01:14:25,132 --> 01:14:26,167
I had a girl.

1010
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:33,808
She died, and that was
the end of the marriage.

1011
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:46,020
Your pops?

1012
01:14:46,988 --> 01:14:49,857
- Yeah, he's dead, too.
- Hmm. How?

1013
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:53,561
- Drugs.
- Huh.

1014
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:57,665
What was his name?

1015
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:01,635
- Maladi.
- Maladi.

1016
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:05,973
It's an African name.

1017
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:10,611
When did he come here?

1018
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:16,751
- About 200 years ago.
- Uh-huh.

1019
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,503
Say there's
about 300 botanical gardens

1020
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:17,104
in the United States.

1021
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:21,208
And most of them
are pretty good, some are great.

1022
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:24,513
But they all owe a debt
to this guy, John Bartram.

1023
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:29,483
His garden in 1728,
in Philadelphia,

1024
01:17:30,284 --> 01:17:32,887
it was the model for gardens
that came after.

1025
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:35,489
And this guy
was generous to a fault.

1026
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:39,960
I mean, so he collected seeds
from all over the Northeast

1027
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:43,697
and he'd send them to botanists
all over the world.

1028
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:47,134
They call them
"Bartram's boxes."

1029
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:50,905
The Japanese garden's
that way...

1030
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,375
and the tropical pavilion's
this way.

1031
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:58,679
I saw your tattoos last night.

1032
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,219
Did you want me to?

1033
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:17,031
That must have taken
a long time.

1034
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:20,100
It did, yeah.

1035
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:22,970
Do you have anything
to say about it?

1036
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:26,440
Not at the moment.

1037
01:18:29,743 --> 01:18:31,613
You should have them removed.

1038
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:34,081
I looked into it
and I decided not to.

1039
01:18:34,215 --> 01:18:36,083
Well,
that's really fucked.

1040
01:18:38,118 --> 01:18:39,386
This way.

1041
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,208
Are you going
to say anything?

1042
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:10,884
I saw what I saw, right?

1043
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:13,988
Mm-hmm.

1044
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:22,263
So, can you imagine
what I'm feeling right now?

1045
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,466
How much of a mind fuck
all of this is?

1046
01:19:27,868 --> 01:19:30,504
No, of course you can't.

1047
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:38,078
I thought you should know
I was once someone else.

1048
01:19:46,755 --> 01:19:50,291
I was raised to hate people
that were different than me.

1049
01:19:52,293 --> 01:19:53,360
And I did.

1050
01:19:55,896 --> 01:19:57,331
And I was good at it.

1051
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:03,203
And what did you do

1052
01:20:04,038 --> 01:20:05,472
to the people you hated?

1053
01:20:06,874 --> 01:20:09,343
Did you... beat them?

1054
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:11,979
Kill them? What?

1055
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,651
I hate Robbie and Sissy.

1056
01:20:16,785 --> 01:20:18,285
Are you going to kill them
for me?

1057
01:20:19,253 --> 01:20:21,623
- I hate...
- No, don't fucking talk to me

1058
01:20:21,756 --> 01:20:23,725
about hate. I have enough hate
for the both of us.

1059
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:26,226
- Sorry...
- Don't touch me!

1060
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:43,545
So, who are you right now?

1061
01:20:46,947 --> 01:20:48,349
I'm just a gardener...

1062
01:20:51,753 --> 01:20:53,387
who used to be someone else.

1063
01:20:57,826 --> 01:20:59,326
But now I'm your friend.

1064
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:25,352
No, I cannot even be
in the same room as you.

1065
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:26,920
No, stop! Fuck!

1066
01:21:47,509 --> 01:21:49,410
<i>I drove her to the motel.</i>

1067
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:52,446
<i>Got two rooms.</i>

1068
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:58,152
<i>She did not say a word.</i>

1069
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,958
<i>This journal</i>
<i>was so helpful to me</i>

1070
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:06,795
<i>when I was under house arrest</i>

1071
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,463
<i>and for many years after.</i>

1072
01:22:10,297 --> 01:22:12,366
<i>Now, I just find it a burden.</i>

1073
01:22:29,784 --> 01:22:32,687
- Deputy Marshal Neruda?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1074
01:22:33,487 --> 01:22:35,657
- Narvel Roth.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1075
01:22:36,724 --> 01:22:38,158
We need to meet again.

1076
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:41,295
Tomorrow?

1077
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,230
<i>Saturday?</i>

1078
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:45,332
Uh, things have been
a bit hectic around here,

1079
01:22:45,466 --> 01:22:47,134
but everybody's got
the day off tomorrow,

1080
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:48,636
so that works for me.

1081
01:22:49,503 --> 01:22:51,138
<i>All right, 3:00 p.m.</i>

1082
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:52,707
See you there.

1083
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:45,158
Narvel?

1084
01:23:47,094 --> 01:23:48,362
It's Maya.

1085
01:23:51,465 --> 01:23:52,800
Can you open the door?

1086
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:03,578
I'd like to come in.

1087
01:24:03,711 --> 01:24:05,013
Is that okay?

1088
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:06,781
Yeah, okay.

1089
01:24:14,321 --> 01:24:15,690
Anything to drink?

1090
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:20,093
Well, I... I got a soda
from the machine.

1091
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:22,830
That's okay.

1092
01:24:29,871 --> 01:24:33,206
I really want
to take off my clothes.

1093
01:24:34,809 --> 01:24:36,109
Is that okay?

1094
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:43,417
I want to take off my clothes
so bad.

1095
01:24:44,986 --> 01:24:46,721
I would like nothing more.

1096
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:11,613
Take your clothes off.

1097
01:25:31,431 --> 01:25:32,734
Take off your shirt.

1098
01:26:03,965 --> 01:26:05,198
Turn around.

1099
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,594
And you'll have them removed?

1100
01:26:35,395 --> 01:26:36,597
Yes.

1101
01:26:39,266 --> 01:26:40,500
Continue.

1102
01:27:35,223 --> 01:27:36,423
Narvel?

1103
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,770
Whoo!

1104
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:57,812
Yeah!

1105
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:14,562
Whoo!

1106
01:28:15,797 --> 01:28:20,968
Yeah!

1107
01:29:06,247 --> 01:29:07,380
Uh...

1108
01:29:07,582 --> 01:29:09,349
Yeah, excuse me?

1109
01:29:09,617 --> 01:29:11,052
Sit down, Mr. Roth.

1110
01:29:16,924 --> 01:29:19,426
- Can I get you something?
- No.

1111
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:22,964
Where's Oscar?

1112
01:29:25,465 --> 01:29:26,767
Deputy Marshal Neruda

1113
01:29:26,901 --> 01:29:28,669
is less than three months
from retirement.

1114
01:29:28,803 --> 01:29:30,271
He felt this would be
a good occasion

1115
01:29:30,403 --> 01:29:31,706
to introduce his replacement.

1116
01:29:32,173 --> 01:29:35,743
I'm Stephen Collins,
though folks call me Stick.

1117
01:29:38,411 --> 01:29:39,714
Nice to meet you.

1118
01:29:41,481 --> 01:29:42,917
Oscar has briefed me.

1119
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,753
Your confidentiality has been
in no way breached.

1120
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:49,323
Thank you.

1121
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,292
I'm aware of your
exemplary record

1122
01:29:51,424 --> 01:29:52,827
over the last decade.

1123
01:29:53,094 --> 01:29:54,195
Hey, congratulations.

1124
01:29:54,328 --> 01:29:58,065
Oscar and I met
several weeks ago, here and...

1125
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:00,668
we made an agreement.

1126
01:30:02,036 --> 01:30:04,839
And I just wanted an update
before I go back.

1127
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:09,777
And what sort of agreement
was that?

1128
01:30:10,344 --> 01:30:14,282
It was about a drug crew working
in the 9th Street Projects.

1129
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:18,052
Oh, he... he never said anything
about that.

1130
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:21,722
Uh...

1131
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,427
Do you think we can get him
on the phone?

1132
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,164
I'm your handler now.

1133
01:30:30,798 --> 01:30:34,001
Deputy Marshal Neruda
has handed over your case.

1134
01:30:34,235 --> 01:30:35,269
Just like that?

1135
01:30:36,003 --> 01:30:38,539
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- Yeah.

1136
01:30:38,839 --> 01:30:41,208
What was the problem
on the 9th Street Projects?

1137
01:30:43,911 --> 01:30:47,982
- It was about a drug crew.
- W... what type of drug crew?

1138
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:53,888
Nice to meet you, Stick.

1139
01:30:54,021 --> 01:30:55,856
And I'm sure you're pretty good
at your job,

1140
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:58,025
but I just don't think
that you can help me

1141
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,560
in this situation.

1142
01:31:00,261 --> 01:31:01,829
Hey, try me.

1143
01:31:04,098 --> 01:31:05,132
I just did.

1144
01:31:34,362 --> 01:31:36,163
- Here.
- Thanks.

1145
01:31:42,536 --> 01:31:43,771
Yeah?

1146
01:31:44,504 --> 01:31:45,806
Yeah.

1147
01:31:49,877 --> 01:31:51,545
Was anybody hurt?

1148
01:31:54,815 --> 01:31:56,617
Did you call the police?

1149
01:32:01,422 --> 01:32:02,923
Where... Where are you now?

1150
01:32:06,594 --> 01:32:08,129
Is Norma okay?

1151
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:13,868
All right, I'm on my way.

1152
01:32:15,069 --> 01:32:16,137
Huh?

1153
01:32:17,605 --> 01:32:19,106
Yeah, yeah. Go, go.

1154
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:24,812
There was an incident
at Gracewood Gardens.

1155
01:32:25,112 --> 01:32:27,014
- What?
- Vandalism.

1156
01:32:28,282 --> 01:32:29,316
Nobody was hurt.

1157
01:32:31,719 --> 01:32:32,987
It's Robbie.

1158
01:32:36,991 --> 01:32:39,326
It's an hour-and-a-half.
Grab your stuff.

1159
01:33:40,888 --> 01:33:42,189
The police left.

1160
01:33:44,391 --> 01:33:45,759
What did you tell them?

1161
01:33:46,595 --> 01:33:47,995
I didn't really see anything.

1162
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:51,899
Where's Norma?

1163
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,268
In the sitting room.
Janine's with her.

1164
01:34:16,423 --> 01:34:17,758
Look who's back.

1165
01:34:17,925 --> 01:34:19,293
The bad penny.

1166
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,296
- How are you?
- All right.

1167
01:34:22,463 --> 01:34:23,632
No one came in.

1168
01:34:23,764 --> 01:34:25,699
Porch Dog got kicked.

1169
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,168
Oh.

1170
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:29,737
I had this.

1171
01:34:30,437 --> 01:34:33,508
Father's trophy Luger.

1172
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:36,578
- Let me take that.
- They might come back.

1173
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:38,679
They were in your cabin.

1174
01:34:42,983 --> 01:34:45,085
Uh, are the police coming back?

1175
01:34:45,286 --> 01:34:46,320
We don't know.

1176
01:34:47,589 --> 01:34:49,857
Well, I'd rather not be here
if they do.

1177
01:34:51,926 --> 01:34:53,394
Janine, look after her.

1178
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:32,459
I can call them
and find out where they are.

1179
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,399
What are you going to do?

1180
01:36:41,368 --> 01:36:43,837
You wait here, I'm gonna
tie up some loose ends.

1181
01:36:43,971 --> 01:36:46,140
No, these aren't
your loose ends.

1182
01:36:46,907 --> 01:36:48,142
They are now.

1183
01:36:48,275 --> 01:36:49,810
Well, you can't find them
without me.

1184
01:36:50,244 --> 01:36:52,880
I'm coming with you.

1185
01:36:56,518 --> 01:36:57,951
You'll do as I say?

1186
01:37:01,922 --> 01:37:03,123
Yeah.

1187
01:37:07,861 --> 01:37:09,129
All right.

1188
01:37:10,565 --> 01:37:12,132
We wait until dark.

1189
01:37:25,613 --> 01:37:28,115
All right, they just left.
They're headed there now.

1190
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:31,251
It's the house,
I've been there before.

1191
01:37:31,919 --> 01:37:32,853
What goes on?

1192
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:35,489
It's just a party house.

1193
01:37:36,156 --> 01:37:38,992
Video games, music, dope,
fucking.

1194
01:37:39,393 --> 01:37:42,296
It's just a regular house,
so people can dip out the back.

1195
01:37:44,064 --> 01:37:45,567
Well, all the better.

1196
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,135
What'd he say?

1197
01:37:50,504 --> 01:37:54,208
"Come over any time.
All is forgiven."

1198
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:59,480
Once we're inside,
you step back.

1199
01:38:01,248 --> 01:38:02,983
I'll take it from there.

1200
01:38:03,618 --> 01:38:04,918
Okay?

1201
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:28,710
Craig!

1202
01:38:29,476 --> 01:38:31,011
Yo, Maya, wassup,

1203
01:38:31,145 --> 01:38:32,547
wassup, wassup, wassup?

1204
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,181
- What's going on?
- How are you?

1205
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:36,216
- I've been good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1206
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:38,853
Yeah, I hit up RG.
He told us to come through so...

1207
01:38:38,986 --> 01:38:41,488
Oh.

1208
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:45,359
Wait, wait, wait.

1209
01:38:56,036 --> 01:38:57,938
Everybody out!

1210
01:38:59,674 --> 01:39:01,241
No, nope, not you two.

1211
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,849
Get up, get over by the wall.

1212
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:09,082
Turn around, sit down.

1213
01:39:09,216 --> 01:39:10,951
Down, down, down, down,
get down.

1214
01:39:11,084 --> 01:39:13,153
Maya? Come here.

1215
01:39:19,527 --> 01:39:22,697
You wanted them dead,
now here they are.

1216
01:39:23,898 --> 01:39:25,466
All right, come here.

1217
01:39:27,234 --> 01:39:28,603
Now you're gonna shoot them
right in the head.

1218
01:39:28,736 --> 01:39:30,605
Maya, please,
we didn't mean any harm.

1219
01:39:30,738 --> 01:39:33,273
You decide.
Who do you want to shoot first?

1220
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:36,544
You can take whatever you want.
We know we messed up.

1221
01:39:36,744 --> 01:39:38,212
Concentrate.

1222
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,348
It's your move.

1223
01:39:45,887 --> 01:39:47,354
Maya, please.

1224
01:40:06,273 --> 01:40:07,474
Stretch your legs out.

1225
01:40:07,609 --> 01:40:09,042
- You'll never see us.
- Hey.

1226
01:40:09,176 --> 01:40:10,945
- You'll never see us...
- Stretch 'em out!

1227
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:12,647
Come on, out, out.

1228
01:40:12,847 --> 01:40:14,014
Stretch 'em out!

1229
01:40:14,414 --> 01:40:17,619
I need you to remember.

1230
01:41:30,324 --> 01:41:31,559
How's it going?

1231
01:41:31,693 --> 01:41:33,327
They should be done
by today.

1232
01:41:53,413 --> 01:41:55,148
Ronnie made some tea.

1233
01:41:58,052 --> 01:41:59,319
How's Porch Dog?

1234
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:00,788
He's gonna be all right.

1235
01:42:00,922 --> 01:42:02,724
I thought I'd have to pay
the vet a fortune,

1236
01:42:02,857 --> 01:42:05,693
but he just...
up and recovered on his own.

1237
01:42:05,827 --> 01:42:08,763
- Hmm.
- Some men are like that.

1238
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:17,504
I have three matters
to discuss with you.

1239
01:42:19,974 --> 01:42:21,174
Firstly...

1240
01:42:22,175 --> 01:42:24,679
there is your father's Luger.

1241
01:42:25,647 --> 01:42:28,148
It's an heirloom.
You should have it.

1242
01:42:31,052 --> 01:42:32,520
Secondly, I'd like to discuss

1243
01:42:32,654 --> 01:42:35,422
the restoration
of Gracewood Gardens.

1244
01:42:36,557 --> 01:42:39,694
And the damage seems
irreparable now, but...

1245
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:43,363
plants rejuvenate,
that's what they do.

1246
01:42:44,666 --> 01:42:45,600
Like us.

1247
01:42:47,334 --> 01:42:49,336
Give yourself another year

1248
01:42:49,837 --> 01:42:51,338
and help me or...

1249
01:42:52,339 --> 01:42:53,608
help us

1250
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:55,643
and next year's Spring Gala

1251
01:42:55,777 --> 01:42:58,713
will be an achievement
for Gracewood.

1252
01:43:00,882 --> 01:43:02,382
And your other point?

1253
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:05,853
That's the us part.

1254
01:43:08,623 --> 01:43:11,458
Maya and I will be
living together in the cabin

1255
01:43:11,592 --> 01:43:13,594
as husband and wife.

1256
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,803
That is...

1257
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:24,605
obscene.

1258
01:43:27,175 --> 01:43:28,509
No, it's not.

1259
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:32,212
I've seen obscene.

1260
01:43:39,053 --> 01:43:41,388
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

1261
01:43:45,392 --> 01:43:46,961
Go ahead,
pull the trigger.

1262
01:43:47,762 --> 01:43:51,498
Go ahead, I deserve it.
And there is a justice in it.

1263
01:43:54,301 --> 01:43:55,570
But I have to warn you.

1264
01:43:55,703 --> 01:43:58,906
The gun is not working,
and it's not loaded.

1265
01:44:02,409 --> 01:44:04,277
Goddamn you, Sweet Pea.

1266
01:44:07,782 --> 01:44:10,450
Let's talk tomorrow.
I should go.

1267
01:44:25,867 --> 01:44:29,269
<i>A garden job well done</i>
<i>is a visual pleasure.</i>

1268
01:44:30,071 --> 01:44:32,507
<i>Where there was</i>
<i>an unsightly tangle,</i>

1269
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,042
<i>there is a display</i>
<i>of what should be there</i>

1270
01:44:35,176 --> 01:44:36,911
<i>instead of what should not be.</i>

1271
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:41,983
<i>Gardening is the manipulation</i>
<i>of the natural world.</i>

1272
01:44:42,817 --> 01:44:46,353
<i>A creation of order,</i>
<i>where order is appropriate.</i>

1273
01:44:47,522 --> 01:44:49,524
<i>The subtle adjustments</i>
<i>of disorder</i>

1274
01:44:49,657 --> 01:44:51,458
<i>where that would be effective.</i>
