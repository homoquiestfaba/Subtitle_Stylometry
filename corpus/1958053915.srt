[mother] [muffled] <i>Chloe!</i>

2
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,379
<i>Chloe?</i>

3
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>Chloe!</i>

4
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,344
<i>Be careful!</i>

5
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:04,551
[inaudible]

6
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:14,655
Is it okay if I speak
and we use that?

7
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:17,172
- Yeah.
- Okay.

8
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,896
My signing is adequate, but,
this will get fairly detailed.

9
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,723
Okay, so, your address.

10
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,585
Oh, that's Cape Cod, isn't it?

11
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,793
Is that where you're from?

12
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,895
No, no, I'm from Maryland.

13
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,688
I live there with my dad.

14
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,964
He's a doctor.

15
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,000
That's our old,
like, summer house.

16
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,723
I haven't been in
years. We're selling it.

17
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:42,724
Oh, I see.

18
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:44,969
So how did you
find out about us?

19
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:49,102
Online. I've been
following your project.

20
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,000
And no cochlear implant?

21
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,964
No, no the timing
was never right.

22
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:56,005
Oh, everyone is different.

23
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,033
And with your hearing
loss, profile, and speech,

24
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,724
you are an excellent
candidate for our study.

25
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:05,930
I still see a speech therapist.

26
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,206
Oh, okay.

27
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,724
So, I have to ask.

28
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:13,206
Why are you doing this?

29
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:18,137
Regaining sensory ability
can be quite jarring.

30
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,862
I remember...

31
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:27,241
hearing sounds...

32
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:29,999
voices and...

33
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,654
it's still...

34
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:32,655
inside me.

35
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:35,793
The silence, it's
just something I've...

36
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,033
adjusted to.

37
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,689
But this...

38
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,620
this is mine!

39
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:46,862
Okay.

40
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:50,757
Well, this is a stage
one clinical trial.

41
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:53,826
Right now, once mature auditory
nerve cells are damaged,

42
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:54,895
that's it.

43
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,056
Hearing loss is irreversible.

44
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:59,896
The purpose of this
study is to change that.

45
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,895
<i>We are using an experimental
gene editing technique</i>

46
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:10,379
<i>that mimics prenatal cellular
growth in the inner ear.</i>

47
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:17,708
<i>The procedure itself
is relatively simple.</i>

48
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:22,275
<i>A stem cell-associated retrovirus
is injected into your inner ear.</i>

49
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:31,343
<i>This retrovirus will "infect"
the surrounding tissue</i>

50
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:34,206
<i>with a gene responsible
for auditory cell growth.</i>

51
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:42,137
[suspenseful music]

52
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:47,137
<i>The damaged nerve fibers
will grow back, restored.</i>

53
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,344
<i>And your sense of
hearing will return.</i>

54
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:16,691
<i>You can probably take
those bandages off now.</i>

55
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:20,379
Just wait to put your hearing
aids back in until tomorrow.

56
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:24,034
It could be weeks
until we see results.

57
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,171
Kind of like a cold.

58
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,310
We have to allow it
to run its course.

59
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:30,930
Oh!

60
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:32,034
Alright,

61
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,378
use these drops twice a day.

62
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:37,447
Once in the morning
and once at night.

63
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,102
[Chloe] Okay.

64
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:42,067
It's a steroidal solution
to increase cell growth

65
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:43,344
and slow the immune response.

66
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:47,412
You might experience
some minor side effects.

67
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:52,241
Increased heart rate, light headedness,
dizziness, but nothing too serious.

68
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,137
We're being hopeful.

69
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,000
But, please remember that

70
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:07,000
there is a strong possibility
this may not work.

71
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:11,862
Okay.

72
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,275
Oh!

73
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:19,999
Here you go. This is my card.

74
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,931
Please don't hesitate to email or text
me if you have any questions or problems.

75
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:26,034
Okay.

Okay... okay... can you
say... can you say that again?

100
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,758
[Hank] I'm Hank Fowler, your dad
called me about the water heater.

101
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:22,896
Right.

102
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,172
Yes, yes.

103
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:27,206
Thank you.

104
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,931
Yep. Sorry to startle you.

105
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,137
Oh!

106
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,172
You're little Chloe?

107
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:46,172
Last time I saw you
you were yay high.

108
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:49,310
Yeah, that was like
twelve years ago.

109
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:54,034
How are you doing with your...

110
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:56,068
I've adjusted.

111
00:22:57,896 --> 00:23:00,137
Your dad said you were in
town for some sort of...

112
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:02,274
study.

113
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:03,724
Yeah.

114
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:05,724
To restore my hearing.

115
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,274
They can do that?

116
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,586
Not yet.

117
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:13,137
It's an experiment,
but we're hopeful.

118
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,655
Good luck with that, wow.

119
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:20,344
I can get you hot water.

120
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:23,827
It's in... [Hank] I know...

121
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,000
Should be good here.

122
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,172
Okay.

123
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,012
Your dad said you're
looking to sell the place.

124
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,724
I know he tried
the Airbnb thing.

125
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,792
Y-yeah...

126
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,655
yeah, it's just too far for us.

127
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,102
It's time.

128
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,103
Yeah...

129
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:13,965
I'd say.

130
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:15,964
All right, well,

131
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:18,931
if you need anything,
just let me know.

132
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:22,655
Actually there is one thing.

133
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,965
[Hank] All right, give it a try.

134
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:36,419
That's the Swedes for you.

135
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,931
This is older than you are.

136
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:46,034
I wouldn't drive it back to Maryland
without having it looked at first.

137
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,350
Should have the roads to
yourself this time of year.

138
00:24:51,068 --> 00:24:54,275
Though the off season could get
lonely if you're not used to it.

139
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:58,241
I saw a light on across
the marsh last night.

140
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,413
Could be late renters.

141
00:25:03,827 --> 00:25:06,793
Though the addicts like
to squat in empty houses.

142
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:09,448
There's a problem
with that here.

143
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,343
You'll be okay.

144
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:18,793
I'm down at the harbor most
days, they made me Harbormaster.

145
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,758
If you need anything,
I'm a call away.

146
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:25,378
Or a text.

147
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:26,724
I do that too.

148
00:25:28,275 --> 00:25:30,310
Yeah. My dad gave
me your number.

149
00:25:31,241 --> 00:25:32,344
Thanks.

153
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:50,793
- Can I help you with something?
- Oh.

154
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:53,103
Yeah.

155
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,655
Is that your truck?

156
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:57,758
It is.

157
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,586
I'm cleaning out
our old house and...

158
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:04,000
I could use a truck.

159
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:08,413
I know you.

160
00:31:09,344 --> 00:31:10,384
Your name is Chloe, right?

161
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:14,171
We used to play
together as kids.

162
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,275
I'm Joshua.

163
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,620
Do you remember me?

164
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,482
Yeah.

165
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,447
You got real sick

166
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:28,408
and you lost your hearing
and you never came back.

167
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:32,343
We were wondering what was
going to happen to your house.

168
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,482
Sorry, can you
hear me right now?

169
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:46,793
Hmm.

170
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:51,931
Uh.

171
00:31:52,758 --> 00:31:53,827
Do you live here?

172
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,172
Yeah.

173
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:58,206
My mom still owns them.

174
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:03,379
I told her I thought I
saw you the other day.

175
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:05,448
You should come say hi.

176
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:08,448
She didn't believe that
you were really back.

177
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:13,724
She ain't gonna bite.

178
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:15,862
Come on.

179
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:40,171
Mom.

180
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,413
Brought the Grayden girl.

181
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:42,931
Chloe.

182
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:45,896
Told you she was back.

183
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:52,482
Isn't she deaf?

184
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:56,724
She is, but she makes do.

185
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:03,827
Hello.

186
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,310
I'm Ellen.

187
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:10,275
I used to watch you
when you were a toddler.

188
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:14,137
I knew your mother.

189
00:33:15,724 --> 00:33:17,517
We went to high school together.

190
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,310
Before she met your dad.

191
00:33:25,827 --> 00:33:26,827
How's he doing?

192
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:29,896
He'll be out here in
a couple of weeks.

193
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:33,310
We're trying to sell the house.

194
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:35,344
Sounds about right.

195
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Joshua.

196
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:41,826
- Joshua!
- What?

197
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:44,172
There's that picture
of the two of you.

198
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,654
Can you get it?

199
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:49,343
I want Chloe to see it!

200
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:50,964
[Joshua] Where is it?

201
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:53,827
It's in the yellow album
with the stack of old photos.

202
00:34:04,896 --> 00:34:07,724
Your dad stopped coming
out here after your mom...

203
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,862
Can't blame him.

204
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:15,931
It's real hard to take.

205
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,379
It's still tough on him.

206
00:34:21,965 --> 00:34:23,862
We thought she'd just run off.

207
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,379
Never heard from her?

208
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:27,862
No.

209
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:29,827
Nothing.

210
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:32,000
Nothing.

211
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:36,275
You look just like her.

212
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:41,619
It's like seeing a ghost.

213
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,896
[Joshua] Found it.

214
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,068
Look.

215
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:51,655
[Chloe] I remember this.

216
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,034
[mother] <i>Chloe.</i>

217
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,688
<i>Say Happy Fourth of July.</i>

218
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:55,413
[young Chloe] <i>Happy
Fourth of July!</i>

219
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:16,757
[mother] <i>Say Happy
Fourth of July.</i>

220
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,118
[young Chloe] <i>Happy
Fourth of July!</i>

221
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:37,827
[mother] <i>Chloe.</i>

222
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,620
Mom?

223
00:37:44,586 --> 00:37:45,757
[loud noise]

224
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:52,827
[suspenseful music]

225
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,034
[gasp]

226
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:28,000
[muffled scream]

227
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:44,757
[faint heartbeat]

228
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:51,585
[birds chirping]

229
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:52,931
[yawning]

230
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:17,896
Hey.

231
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,620
Hey!

232
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:27,793
[muffled hearing]

233
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:29,827
[muffled hearing]

234
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:31,931

[calm pop music]

236
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:50,619
[refrigerator engine buzzing]

237
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,689
[water stream splashing]

238
00:40:55,758 --> 00:41:00,344
[water splashing]

239
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:08,206
[metal clanking]

240
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:17,655
[popcorn popping]

241
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:27,964
[radio static]

242
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:35,000

00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,861
[crow cawing]

245
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:38,931
[birds chirping]

246
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:51,379
[phone ringing]

247
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:56,068
[dad] <i>Hello?</i>

248
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,275
<i>Chloe?</i>

249
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,275
[Chloe] Dad.

250
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:01,379
[dad] <i>How are you calling me?</i>

251
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:03,862
<i>Wait.</i>

252
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:04,965
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

253
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:11,206
[Chloe] Yeah!

254
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:14,206
I can hear you.

255
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:16,896
I think it's working.

256
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:18,724
[dad] <i>Oh, my god.</i>

257
00:43:19,793 --> 00:43:21,000
<i>This is incredible...</i>

258
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:26,114
Well say something, please!

259
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,482
[dad] <i>I'm actually
at a loss for words.</i>

260
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:32,413
<i>I'm so happy for you.</i>

261
00:43:33,586 --> 00:43:34,895
[laughing]

262
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:36,056
<i>I can't believe this is real.</i>

263
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,206
<i>After all this time,
you can hear again.</i>

264
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:43,827
[soft exhaling]

265
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:02,172
[scanner sound]

266
00:44:08,275 --> 00:44:09,275
[beeping]

267
00:44:13,482 --> 00:44:14,482
[beeping]

268
00:44:18,482 --> 00:44:19,482
[beeping]

269
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:24,965
[beeping]

270
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,596
[Dr. Lynch] <i>This is better than
we could have ever expected.</i>

271
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,447
There's activity in 80
percent of the damaged cells

272
00:44:32,448 --> 00:44:34,379
along with new growth in
the surrounding tissue.

273
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,309
This is remarkable progress

274
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,033
and so quickly, I mean...

275
00:44:39,034 --> 00:44:41,171
the range, the
frequencies, it's...

276
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:42,448
truly astonishing.

277
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:44,827
I mean I can hear like...

278
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:47,033
everything!

279
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:49,551
My voice has changed so
much and your voice is

280
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:53,344
different than what I
imagined it to sound like.

281
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:55,481
In a good way, I hope.

282
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:58,965
Yes, yes, it's fine,
it's beautiful.

283
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:01,931
It's just different.

284
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:05,481
Well, yes, this can
be overwhelming.

285
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:08,103
We have therapists who can
help with the transition.

286
00:45:10,517 --> 00:45:13,999
I can always hear
things in my dreams,

287
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,137
like memories and
people, is that... weird?

288
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,930
No.

289
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:21,654
No, you were old enough to remember
sounds when you lost your hearing.

290
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:22,655
Not weird at all.

291
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:24,551
Okay.

292
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:27,344
So what now?

293
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:30,481
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

294
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:33,343
Keep using the drops
and if anything changes,

295
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:35,034
anything at all, just...

296
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,206
well, I guess, just call me.

297
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,379
Woah. Yeah.

298
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
[indistinct chattering,

299
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:04,206
[I.T. Tech] Excuse me.

[police sirens closing in]

304
00:47:25,206 --> 00:47:26,448
Been awhile.

305
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:30,206
Another one's gone missing.

306
00:47:32,068 --> 00:47:33,068
What do you mean?

307
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,723
Cleaning up after her shift,

308
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:39,103
never came home.

309
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:43,413
No car, no body...

310
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:47,000
No trace.

311
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,206
Flying south for the winter.

312
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:58,551
They use the earth's magnetic
fields for their migratory patterns.

313
00:48:02,241 --> 00:48:03,241
This place...

314
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:05,620
it does things to you.

315
00:48:09,448 --> 00:48:10,448
Yeah.

316
00:48:19,551 --> 00:48:20,551
Wait...

317
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:24,068
could you hear me?

318
00:48:38,413 --> 00:48:39,689

[Hank] That's our
wall of shame there.

Am I crazy or is that
treatment you're doing working?

00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,793
Yeah, it is.

Ain't that something!

354

It's freezing out here!

355

You want a fisherman's warm up?

Come on.

00:56:58,344 --> 00:56:59,344
Here you go.

So how does it feel?

363
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,862
Hearing after all this time.

364
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:27,586
Still getting used to it.

365
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,758
I forgot how noisy the world is.

366
00:57:32,862 --> 00:57:34,000
Ain't that the truth.

367
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:39,102
I saw you in a uniform.

368
00:57:39,103 --> 00:57:40,655
In my dad's old pictures.

369

you were police.

370
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:45,172
Huh.

Was police.

372
00:57:47,275 --> 00:57:51,655
Some junkie decided to give
me an early retirement.

373
00:57:52,724 --> 00:57:53,862
Medals and all.

374
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:55,965
Probably for the best.

375
00:57:57,793 --> 00:57:58,793
As a cop you...

376
00:57:59,862 --> 00:58:02,172
see things most people
don't get to see.

377
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:05,000
I don't miss it really.

378
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,068
We looked for your mom.

379
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:15,310
It was really hard to do.

380
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:19,586
Yeah...

381
00:58:22,344 --> 00:58:24,793
That's the last time I remember
really hearing anything.

382
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:30,241
I still hear her voice.

383
00:58:38,793 --> 00:58:39,827
I...

384
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:42,310
I wanted to tell you something.

385
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,724
I saw you the other day

386
00:58:47,068 --> 00:58:48,654
with Joshua. -Ellen's

387
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:50,033
boy.
- Oh.

388
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:51,724
You might want to be
careful around them.

389
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:54,000
He's been in some trouble.

390
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:56,792
What kind of trouble?

391
00:58:56,793 --> 00:58:57,793
Uh...

392
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,379
A few years back, uh...

393
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:08,999
some pets were going missing.

394
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,102
Dogs, primarily.

395
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:12,758
All over the outer Cape.

396
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:15,234
They couldn't prove it, but...

397
00:59:16,206 --> 00:59:18,137
I felt like he had
something to do with it.

398
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:22,172
Him and his ma,
they're wired funny.

399
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:26,241
She's had a rough go of it.

400
00:59:29,206 --> 00:59:30,206
Yeah.

401
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:32,206
Thanks for the heads up.

402
00:59:33,172 --> 00:59:34,758
Hey, don't mention it.

403
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:43,344
Hank...

404
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,965

supposed to happen.

492

It can be hard to distinguish between
what's real and what's imagined.

493
01:13:15,275 --> 01:13:17,896
It could just be symptoms
of sensory overload.

Sustained loud noises can,

495
01:13:21,517 --> 01:13:22,862
they can sound like voices.

for anyone to handle.

01:13:34,655 --> 01:13:37,586

to talk through it.

01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,895

504
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:02,689

01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:07,102

- Yeah.
- Let's get away from this place for a bit.

01:14:13,137 --> 01:14:14,862
Yeah, yeah, I'd like that.

508
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:22,965

know you from your file.

01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:25,068
What are you up to?

510
01:14:25,793 --> 01:14:27,206
Are you in school, or...?

511
01:14:28,862 --> 01:14:29,862
Kinda.

512
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:31,275
I took the semester off.

513
01:14:31,965 --> 01:14:33,826
For your project, actually

514
01:14:33,827 --> 01:14:35,147
and to help my dad
sell the house.

515
01:14:36,068 --> 01:14:37,275
Is it just the two of you?

516
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,620
Yeah,

517
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:42,034

518
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:44,551
Disappeared.

519
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:47,034
We don't know, actually.

520
01:14:49,655 --> 01:14:51,655
I was the last
person to see her.

521
01:14:53,896 --> 01:14:54,896
I mean I was in this...

522
01:14:56,206 --> 01:14:59,758
coma for six months
from the meningitis.

523
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,551
And I came out of it and I

524
01:15:03,344 --> 01:15:06,241
lost my hearing and my mom.

525
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:10,620
Then got set back
at school and...

526
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:17,655
just like this black
hole it's like...

527
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:21,724
just, an invisible weight.

528
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:25,793
But,

529
01:15:26,827 --> 01:15:27,931
it is what it is, right?

530
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,172
Forces just beyond my control.

531
01:15:37,379 --> 01:15:39,000
You know I was thinking,

532
01:15:40,413 --> 01:15:42,274
maybe after this,

533
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:43,689
I could like become a counselor

534
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:47,310
or something for people
who have the procedure.

535
01:15:48,758 --> 01:15:52,620
We really have quite
a ways off from that.

536
01:15:54,034 --> 01:15:56,654
We have the trials, we
have to get approvals...

537
01:15:56,655 --> 01:15:57,930
- Yeah, no I...
- First...

538
01:15:57,931 --> 01:15:59,275
No, it's...

539
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,793
I see.

540
01:16:03,896 --> 01:16:06,655
Maybe, yeah. Maybe
down the road.

541
01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:08,862
- Yeah.
- It could be helpful.

542
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:13,034

and I see singers, what if the way

547
01:16:40,793 --> 01:16:43,913
that I imagine their songs is better than
the way that they actually are, right?

548
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:47,205
Oh, no I... I don't
keep up with music

549
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:48,965
or trends or anything
like that, I just...

550
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:51,861
you know, whatever's on.

551
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:52,896
Yeah.

552
01:16:53,965 --> 01:16:55,034

Please give me a few minutes.

That tea's going to
make it all better.

748

All better.

749
01:42:17,413 --> 01:42:18,517

Nothing.
