1
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,272
<i>We have a saying here in China.</i>

2
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,582
<i>Seductive, mysterious,</i>
<i>and these days,</i>

3
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,352
<i>very attractive</i>
<i>to foreign businessmen.</i>

4
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,423
<i>Executives, bankers,</i>

5
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,125
<i>engineers, salesmen.</i>

6
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,594
<i>Hundreds of thousands of Americans</i>

7
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,563
<i>now live and work in Shanghai.</i>

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,303
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of one American named Sam.</i>

9
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:18,310
<i>A good man.</i>
<i>Easy to get along with.</i>

10
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,313
<i>Never arrogant or cocky.</i>

11
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,148
<i>And because of this,</i>

12
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,219
<i>he was loved by everyone</i>
<i>he met in Shanghai.</i>

13
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,621
<i>Or...Maybe not.</i>

14
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,749
<i>Sam just won</i>

15
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:01,286
<i>the most important court case</i>
<i>of his life.</i>

16
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,423
<i>His bosses have called him</i>
<i>into a meeting.</i>

17
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,760
<i>Sam chao is on his way</i>
<i>to the top.</i>

18
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,302
And after poaching the client

19
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,073
from a senior associate no less.
Ballsy.

20
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,508
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

21
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,276
The reason why we asked you here, Sam?

22
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:27,513
We've got some exciting news for you.

23
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,383
Yay, Sam! You're the man!

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,587
We're sending you to China.

25
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:47,332
Groff technologies has just
moved its headquarters

26
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,400
to Shanghai.

27
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,135
Word is they're onto something big.

28
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,170
A game changer.

29
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,738
If our top client goes to Shanghai,

30
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,173
that means we go, too.

31
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,542
We've been in touch with
Donald cafferty from amcham,

32
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,743
the American chamber of commerce there.

33
00:02:57,745 --> 00:03:00,746
He's found us an office
and hired us a local staff.

34
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,614
Now all we need is someone to head it up.

35
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,683
You're the obvious choice.

36
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,585
You're single,
you're a go-getter,

37
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,920
and you're even chinese.

38
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,694
Technically, yes.
I'm chinese.

39
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,597
Isn't there something else
you guys wanted to say to me?

40
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,865
We're aware of the rumors.

41
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,668
We're just not ready to name a partner just yet.

42
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,237
But we are ready to send you to China.

43
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,539
This is a huge opportunity, Sam.

44
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,143
Uh, it's an incredibly tempting offer.

45
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,479
But I just feel that I am more of an asset

46
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,315
here in New York.

47
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,683
I mean, I know the ins and outs.
I know everything,

48
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,418
and my thirtieth birthday is coming up.

49
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,486
I've rented out Thomas Keller's restaurant,

50
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,222
I've got a d.J. Coming.

51
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,623
I got, I got a lot of stuff going on.

52
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,158
You know what we like around here, Sam?

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,827
A team player. Three months.

54
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,329
That's all we ask.

55
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,264
What do you say?

56
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,458
That's me.

57
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,227
Welcome to China.

58
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,795
Amanda Wilson.
Relocation specialist.

59
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,197
It's my job to help you get adjusted.

60
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,431
Hi.

61
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,200
For a second, I thought I'd missed you.

62
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:30,769
I was running late, my ayi was
sick, had to find a babysitter.

63
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,371
Everything ok?

64
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,806
Yeah, I was just expecting someone with

65
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,408
slightly...Darker hair.

66
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,380
Ok, here's your survival packs.

67
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,282
Some chinese yuan. Money.
In other words.

68
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,651
A map of Shanghai, your business cards,

69
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,387
and your mobile phone. Your
number is right on the back.

70
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,588
So before we go to your apartment,

71
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,889
I want to take you to meet Donald from amcham.

72
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,325
He's kind of the mayor of americatown.

73
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,662
Yeah. That's what we call our
little expat community over here.

74
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,996
It's kind of like Chinatown
in the U.S.,

75
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,598
but the other way around.

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,433
Ah...

77
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,834
Here you go.

78
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,974
You speak chinese?

79
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,809
Of course. Don't you?

80
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,077
Eh.

81
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,758
What's going on here?

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,826
A restaurant opening.

83
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,362
Oh, yeah? I love
a good restaurant.

84
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,863
What kind of food do they have?

85
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,606
- Donald!
- Amanda! Good morning.

86
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,343
Well, this must be Sam.

87
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,612
Donald cafferty, president of jfc China.

88
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,514
Sam chao. Nice to meet you.

89
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:25,317
I've never seen so much fanfare
at a fast food place before.

90
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,418
Our eight thousandth store opening

91
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,019
called for a little celebration.

92
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,889
The chinese are crazy about fried chicken.

93
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,325
Here, have a coupon for a free
spicy chicken sandwich.

94
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,659
Welcome to Shanghai.

95
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,395
What are you doing Thursday night?

96
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,863
Uh...

97
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,898
Great. Meet me for drinks
out on the bund.

98
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,534
I'll introduce you to all
the top business execs in town.

99
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,403
Microsoft, P&G, Ford.

100
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,804
I'm gonna drive a lot of business your way.

101
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:48,006
Ever been to China before?

102
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:51,676
I never been above 79th street before.

103
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:53,912
New York. Street.

104
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,648
Joke.

105
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,916
He's gonna be a homesick one, I can tell.

106
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,786
Lucky for you, I own
an American bar in hongqiao.

107
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,521
You ever get lonely, come on by.

108
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,623
Ok. Sounds great.

109
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,025
Good man.
Now if you'll excuse me,

110
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,628
I'm late for my photo shoot.

111
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,029
Modeling career finally taking off?

112
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,366
No. Amcham elections
are coming up.

113
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,402
See you Thursday, Sam.

114
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,805
Yeah. Thursday.

115
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,375
So. Ready to see
your new apartment?

116
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:24,776
As ready as I'll ever be.

117
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,411
Sorry?

118
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,948
Look. I had a nice life
back in New York.

119
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,117
So whatever you found me

120
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,718
better not be too much of a letdown.

121
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,958
Ok. Here we are.

122
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,894
Two bed, two bath.

123
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,764
Hardwood floors, recycled glass windows,

124
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,032
high-def tv,
solar panels on the roof.

125
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,502
And the entire building is brand new.

126
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,870
What do you think?

127
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,548
That's awesome.

128
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,723
I'll take it.

129
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,191
Ok. I'll get the papers ready.

130
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,195
You gotta be kidding me.

131
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,463
What the hell was that?

132
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,999
Construction. But they're
supposed to be finished by now!

133
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,734
Are you telling me this building
is still being built?

134
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,703
Shanghai and construction go hand in hand.

135
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,638
Sometimes these new greener buildings

136
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,673
take just a little bit longer
to get--

137
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,813
I have to get you out of here.

138
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,015
I have a backup apartment down the street.

139
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,984
It's not as nice as this one,
but at least it's finished.

140
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,452
Is it a dump?

141
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,220
No. I mean, uh...

142
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,155
It's a tad smaller,
and the amenities are less new.

143
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,157
But it's a really nice place
in a great neighborhood.

144
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,459
It's a dump.

145
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,894
I'm staying here.
Forget about it.

146
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,029
Sam, I cannot in good conscience

147
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,864
let you stay here with all that
noise going on upstairs.

148
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,866
I completely agree.
So here's what you do.

149
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,768
Just tell them the future partner

150
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,136
of a huge American law firm just moved in,

151
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,938
they need to shut it down for three months,

152
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,006
or else I'll Sue them.

153
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,508
Here's my card.

154
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,144
This may not work.

155
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,546
Amy...

156
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,813
Amanda.

157
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,650
Your job was to find me a nice,
quiet place to live,

158
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,151
and you failed.

159
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,252
Now are you going to resolve this issue,

160
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,122
or do I need to replace you?

161
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,326
It's you.

162
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:27,866
This is Sam.

163
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,034
<i>Hello, Mr. chao.</i>

164
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,602
<i>This is fang fang,</i>
<i>your new assistant.</i>

165
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,237
<i>I hope you had a good flight.</i>

166
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,839
<i>Are you planning to attend</i>
<i>the Marcus groff meeting today?</i>

167
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,842
Today? No. I thought the meeting
was tomorrow, on the 17th.

168
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:42,047
<i>Fang fang:</i>
<i>Yes, but today is the 17th.</i>

169
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,249
That's impossible. I left
New York on the 15th,

170
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,051
and I lost one day by crossing
over the date line.

171
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,719
That makes today the 16th.

172
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,288
<i>Fang fang:</i>
<i>Actually, you lost two days</i>

173
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,992
<i>it became the 16th in the u.S.</i>
<i>While you were in the air.</i>

174
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,027
<i>When you crossed the</i>
<i>date line, it became the 17th,</i>

175
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,097
<i>and Mr. groff will be here</i>
<i>in thirty minutes.</i>

176
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,702
I'll be right there.

177
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,836
- Problem.
- I heard.

178
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,104
You know what, you get to your office.

179
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,039
And I will go upstairs and see what I can do

180
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,841
about that construction issue.

181
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,951
Oh, man.

182
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,031
When did I do this?

183
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,333
Aah!! Who the hell are you?

184
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,339
I got nothing.
I don't speak chinese.

185
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,674
Who are you?

186
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,283
Ayi. Ayi.

187
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:55,987
¿Ayi? Amanda said
that same word.

188
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,656
Are you my nanny?

189
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,924
Are you like a housekeeper?

190
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:03,928
I mean, you clean...

191
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,330
Housekeeper.

192
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,768
Sleep. What?

193
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,836
You live here.
You live with me?

194
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,304
You live with me.

195
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,774
My housekeeper, and you don't speak english?

196
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,609
Habla español?

197
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,679
That was really offensive on many, many levels.

198
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,980
I'm sorry about that.
But I have to go, ayi.

199
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,782
See you later.

200
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,189
Okay, this is, this is yincheng road.

201
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,325
So that's gotta be, ok, that's gotta be...

202
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,328
I have no idea.

203
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,036
Which means... oh, screw it.

204
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,372
Taxi!

205
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,746
Hi. Can you uh, take me
to this address, please?

206
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,818
Just take me to the address.

207
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,190
Why are we arguing?

208
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,362
Okay.
All right. I get it.

209
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,864
I'm from New York City.

210
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,100
So don't think that just because
I'm from out of town,

211
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:17,736
that you can pad the fare by going the long way.

212
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,738
Or whatever it is you're trying to do.

213
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,973
Just take me here.

214
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,492
Thank you.

215
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,034
Mr. chao? We spoke on the phone.
I'm fang fang, your assistant.

216
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,437
Wow. Fang fang.
Thank you for calling.

217
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,838
Is he here?

218
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
Yes. In the conference room.

219
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,742
Marcus groff from groff technology in santonio.

220
00:12:57,744 --> 00:13:00,445
San Antonio. Thank you.

221
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,480
Ok, let's see alamo, riverwalk,

222
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,715
what are you writing?

223
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,717
Talking points.
Last time I met this guy,

224
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,285
he couldn't stop talking about his hometown.

225
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,287
He's like a hundred percent
Texas, through and through.

226
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,728
Marcus.

227
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,730
- Hi. Sam chao.
- Hey, how have you been?

228
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,198
Good to see you again.

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,100
Sorry I'm late, I just flew in
from New York this morning.

230
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,835
I'm just kind of...

231
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,136
Can I get you some coffee or...

232
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,971
There's coffee in China, right, fang fang?

233
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,508
We have decaf, dark roast, french roast,

234
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,277
low fat milk, full fat milk, soy milk,

235
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,445
sugar, honey, and artificial sweetener.

236
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,847
Wow.

237
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,183
Some hot tea would be wonderful.

238
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,851
Looks like I kept you waiting.

239
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,821
Oh, don't sweat it.

240
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,989
I carry my brushes with me wherever I go

241
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,091
so I can practice my chinese calligraphy.

242
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,860
Ever since relocating to Shanghai,

243
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,528
I've just fallen in love with chinese culture.

244
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,297
I know what you mean.

245
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,132
I uh, really treasure my heritage.

246
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,503
There's leaves in my tea.

247
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,505
That's how we drink it.

248
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,842
Mmm. Delicious.

249
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,217
Oh, yeah, this is...

250
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,087
Fragrant.

251
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,856
So, Marcus, what I can help you with today?

252
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,224
What's the biggest complaint

253
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,825
people have about
touch-screen phones?

254
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:26,564
You can't feel the keys, so you
make way too many typos, right?

255
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,966
Not anymore.

256
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,136
Give this baby a try.

257
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,806
Wow. That is impressive.
Look at that.

258
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,141
I can actually see you right through that.

259
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,383
That, that is incredible.

260
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,186
I can actually feel my fingers touching...

261
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,921
The screen. How did you do that?

262
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,590
Using a substrate that's attracted to the charge

263
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,925
of human skin.

264
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:57,028
The inventor's a genius,
a chinese guy named yu baiyang.

265
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,297
Total recluse.

266
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,566
Disappears for months at a time and then

267
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,568
pops up with a gadget that changes everything.

268
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,336
But he's a creative type,

269
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,305
so he usually sells the product

270
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,407
to the first person who finds him.

271
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,575
I found him.

272
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,477
Now I need you

273
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,412
to draw up a purchase agreement

274
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,080
before anybody else finds out about this phone.

275
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,916
I wouldn't recommend that.

276
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,052
No, I mean, it's simply because

277
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,520
purchase agreements can take
a long time to close.

278
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,056
You have to deal with copyrights and trademarks,

279
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,557
and you have to also verify a patents.

280
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,527
I mean, what you want, ideally,
is a license agreement.

281
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,596
It's faster, and if the inventor

282
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,131
isn't too experienced in contracts,

283
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,999
I can get you that phone
for a fraction of the price.

284
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,338
Say the phone is worth $50 million.

285
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,440
We license it for five million.

286
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,609
The inventor keeps all the patents,

287
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,578
and you start producing phones right away.

288
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,948
If it's a hit, everyone makes money.

289
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,549
But what if it's a flop?

290
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,285
See, that's okay, too
because we minimized your risk.

291
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,087
You didn't buy the phones for $50 million,

292
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,655
you licensed it for 5.

293
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,890
So by going this route--

294
00:15:58,892 --> 00:15:59,590
whoa, whoa. Hold up.

295
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,326
I save myself 45 million,

296
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,094
and I still get the phone?

297
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,963
Are you sure he's gonna go for this?

298
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,335
Absolutely.

299
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:14,138
All right. Let's do it.

300
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,208
Well, Sam, I'm sure glad that
you're the one in charge here.

301
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,910
- Thank you.
- All right.

302
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,645
- I'll call you.
- Speak soon.

303
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,283
What the hell was that?

304
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,156
Hmm? You second guessed me in
front of the client back there.

305
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,359
A huge client.

306
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,426
Don't ever do it again.

307
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,595
Understood?

308
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,665
Sam. I'm only trying to help.

309
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:50,308
Oh. Hello. I'm guang.
The computer specialist.

310
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,043
I work with fang fang.

311
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,985
Hello. Powell and Davies.

312
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,454
It's Joey from New York.

313
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,033
Hey, is this seat taken?

314
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:53,171
I thought my girl problems were
supposed to be over, right?

315
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,739
Don't be so hard on yourself, man.

316
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,040
We all have our dry spells.

317
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,208
You don't get it, dude.

318
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,244
My whole life has been a dry spell.

319
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,346
That's why I moved here.

320
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,149
But just before I showed up,
word finally got around

321
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,351
that english teachers
only came here to get laid.

322
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,688
Donald! You made it.

323
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,590
Great to see you, Donald.

324
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,792
Hello. Hello.

325
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,794
There you are, I've been looking
all over for you.

326
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,530
I see you met Brad.
So lay it on me.

327
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,065
What do you think of China so far?

328
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,301
It's interesting.

329
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,336
Sorry, my brain's a little fried.

330
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,804
I haven't slept a wink since I got in.

331
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,173
Been there. Don't worry.

332
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,742
This is gonna be the best move you ever made.

333
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,114
Well, we'll see what happens after I get home.

334
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,782
Home is for suckers.

335
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,184
Let me tell you a story.
Awhile back,

336
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,353
a fry cook from louisville

337
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,223
applies to the exec program at jfc.

338
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,793
He got in, but he was considered a joke.

339
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,728
Then the company opened up shop in China.

340
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,465
Nobody wanted to go, so he volunteered.

341
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,733
20 years later,

342
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,268
he's the third highest paid exec in the company,

343
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,569
and the mayor of americatown.

344
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,507
This is the new land of opportunity, Sam.

345
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,123
Hi there, nice to meet you.

346
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,225
This is Amanda. She's single.

347
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,828
Hi, yeah. I'll be right there.
Excuse me.

348
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,798
Your friend is rather direct, isn't she?

349
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,767
- Yeah.
- I'm Chase.

350
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,435
- Amanda. Hi.
- Hi.

351
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,803
How long have you been in Shanghai, Amanda?

352
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,274
Four years. But these bars
are not my normal hangout.

353
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,241
Mine neither.

354
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,110
I teach at a rural school,

355
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,211
so I don't get into town very often.

356
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,445
Oh.

357
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,480
So uh, what do you do?

358
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,581
Relocation specialist.

359
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,816
I help foreign employees find places to live

360
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,118
when their companies send them--

361
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,619
hi, gorgeous.

362
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,154
It, uh, you know, it keeps me busy.

363
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,156
Especially if the client has a family.

364
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,791
I have to get the kids enrolled
in the international schools--

365
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,360
hey, you're really beautiful, do you know that?

366
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,628
Yeah, that's totally acceptable.

367
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,763
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

368
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,898
Pretty chinese girl.

369
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,166
Where?

370
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,334
Anywhere you look.

371
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,602
Amanda!

372
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,740
Brad. Sam.

373
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,809
Where's Donald? I thought he was
showing you off tonight.

374
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,313
He was, until he got called out
to the dance floor.

375
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,352
So, Sam, how's the apartment?

376
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,854
It's quiet. I told you
my idea would work.

377
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,823
Right.
I'm not sure that it did.

378
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,358
They actually kind of laughed

379
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
when I told them about your lawsuit threat.

380
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:32,230
It really pains you to admit
that I was right, is that it?

381
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,901
Hey, I found another cute guy for you.

382
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,637
He's only 22. Let's go!

383
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,939
So Amanda, she's single, right?

384
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,541
I thought she had a kid.

385
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,577
Divorced. Moved here
right after the split.

386
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,913
Now that her kid's a little older,

387
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,915
her friends are trying to get
her back in the dating scene.

388
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,552
Huh.

389
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:57,622
No, no, no, no.
You do not go there.

390
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:01,692
You didn't come to China to meet white girls.

391
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,630
You're into chinese girls, right?

392
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,765
I don't know, man.
I've never dated one.

393
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,274
You are all messed up, bro.

394
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,210
It's time you got in touch with your culture.

395
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,544
By having sex with it.

396
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,712
Uh-huh.

397
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,948
Dude, you're in China.
Now have some baijiu.

398
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,283
Ganbei!

399
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,637
You know, China's gonna be a
great place once it's finished.

400
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,941
Why are you here?

401
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,277
You passed out at the bar last night,

402
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,246
so I had to drag your ass back home.

403
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:56,914
I was gonna crash on your sofa,

404
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,883
but your bed just looked so comfortable.

405
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,719
You want some breakfast?

406
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:04,655
I know a great steamed bun place near here.

407
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:18,502
Mmm. Mmm!

408
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,406
Mmm! Goddamn,
that's a delicious baozi.

409
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,109
What kind of meat is this again?

410
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,012
Snake.

411
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,049
Aha. Gotcha. It's pork.
It's pork.

412
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,287
Seriously, you gotta try snake
sometime. It's good.

413
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:37,555
I'll be sure to never do that.

414
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,491
Hey, man, thanks for making sure

415
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,892
I got back in one piece last night.

416
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,327
No problem.

417
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,895
I'm gonna get some more baozi.

418
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:46,497
- Ok.
- Mm-hmm.

419
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,609
Hello?

420
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,678
Sam? Marcus groff.

421
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,348
Hey, Marcus. I'm actually not
in the office just yet--

422
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,016
yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've got a problem.

423
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,651
Yu baiyang, the inventor?

424
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:09,854
He signed my license agreement a few days ago.

425
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,756
And then he signed another license agreement

426
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,557
with some local manufacturer.

427
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Marcus.
Relax. He can't do that.

428
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,329
There's no possible way,
why would he even--

429
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,563
- how should I know?

430
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,032
He probably figured out
what a raw deal you gave him.

431
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,934
Now somebody else is making my phones.

432
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,069
Marcus?

433
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,804
This was supposed to be safe, Sam!

434
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,373
Marcus, calm down. Listen
to me. This is totally safe.

435
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,510
There is absolutely no way that
he can license those phones

436
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,044
to another manufacturer.

437
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,679
But if that's what he's trying to do,

438
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,815
we still have plenty of time
to stop whatever deal--

439
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,852
it's a touch-screen phone you
can actually feel the keys on.

440
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,954
I can type so fast on this thing.

441
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,757
See that? I just typed ¿I can
type so fast on this thing

442
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,626
as fast as I said it.

443
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,361
- Marcus, I'll call you back.
- I just typed it again!

444
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:51,695
Where did you get that?

445
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,364
Uh, at a big cell phone store on the corner.

446
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:55,599
But it looks like they're
selling them here, too.

447
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,474
Where did you get this?

448
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,110
This phone.
Where did you get this phone?

449
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,712
Ah, ah, I know, I know.

450
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,595
Whoa. Are we running?
Do we need to run?

451
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:27,531
No, no. I bought them all.
Just grab the rest. Taxi!

452
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,433
Come on, come on, come on!

453
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:34,472
Your trunk, pop your trunk,
please! Thank you.

454
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,740
You really love this phone, huh?

455
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,609
No, Brad.
This is my client's phone.

456
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,177
Somebody else is making them.

457
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,745
How the hell did they get
into these stores so fast?

458
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,414
Uh, haven't you heard?

459
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,516
The chinese are really good
at manufacturing, dude.

460
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,485
Brad, I need to get these phones
off the street asap.

461
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,653
I need you to go to every store
that is selling these phones

462
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,422
and buy them up. Here
I'll give you my corporate card.

463
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:52,957
I've got an english class to teach.

464
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:55,926
Damn it. All right.
I'll call my assistant.

465
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,428
Whoa, hang on, hang on.

466
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,063
I could be persuaded to skip my english class,

467
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,931
if the right motivation was there.

468
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,533
You want me to bribe you?

469
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:07,171
Fine. I will hire you as a local
consultant for the firm.

470
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,439
How is that?

471
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,773
Deal. I'll get right on it.

472
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,209
- Take the card.
- What are you gonna do?

473
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,178
How the hell could you let this happen?

474
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,479
This is not my fault, sir.

475
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,581
Groff was planning to put that touch screen

476
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,918
into every phone, laptop, and tablet he makes.

477
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Now someone else is going to beat him to it

478
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,456
because you got fancy with the contracts.

479
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:28,058
- I didn't--
- if he sues us for negligence,

480
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,095
we're looking at billions
in damages. Billions.

481
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,464
Fix this, Sam. You fix this,

482
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,232
or I will make sure this stink follows you

483
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,700
for the rest of your sorry career.

484
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,135
Do I make myself clear?

485
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,804
Absolutely, sir. I assure you,
this will be taken care of.

486
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,473
Very quickly.

487
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:45,142
I'm talking lightning speed here.

488
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,211
This is--it's fixed. It--

489
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,048
hello? Hello?

490
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,103
Nice place.

491
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,939
Thanks.

492
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,174
Is that Warren buffett?

493
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,810
It sure is.

494
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,045
I showed him around back in '95.

495
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,747
Wish I could've been there.

496
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,150
I mean, I was just in grade school at the time.

497
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,252
Esther wu, climb motors. I'm...

498
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,989
Running against me for amcham presidency.

499
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,790
Thanks for volunteering.

500
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,059
You know, the election committee
always has a hard time

501
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,661
finding someone to run against me.

502
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,096
Is that so?

503
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,732
I should've come to Shanghai
a little sooner then.

504
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:19,303
Shanghai isn't a hardship post
for outcasts anymore.

505
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,138
It's a gold star on your resume,

506
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,840
and it's attracting the best
and brightest these days.

507
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:24,141
Rhodes scholars, mbas...

508
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,077
They're the new face of the expat community.

509
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,912
And they want an amcham president

510
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,247
who shares their background.

511
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,616
Instead of one who...

512
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,251
Took a dying American brand

513
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,087
and turned it into the biggest
restaurant chain in China?

514
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,859
Sam the lawyer.
How's business?

515
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:45,195
Figured out what to do about
that phone manufacturer yet?

516
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,697
You heard about that?

517
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,232
I hear everything.

518
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,001
After all... I am the mayor.

519
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,807
Now let's deal with your little mess.

520
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,110
Call this fella.
He's a problem solver.

521
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,945
Helps guys like you out all the time.

522
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,316
We call him awesome wang.

523
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,154
Freelance reporter.

524
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,955
The kind of guy with a real nose

525
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,857
for digging up
hard-to-find facts.

526
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,193
And nailing the bad guys.

527
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,341
No.

528
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,812
I have a billion dollar legal
mess on my hands right now.

529
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,881
And you want me to call a guy
named awesome wang?

530
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,818
How is that gonna look on my expense report?

531
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,187
You young bucks always think
you know everything.

532
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,055
Awesome wang?

533
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,058
It's ridiculous!

534
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,865
No, the meeting is only with
Mr. Lin, the other manufacturer.

535
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,334
Apparently, yu baiyang is off
finding some sort of

536
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,104
inspiration or something.
I don't know.

537
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,375
Don't worry, Marcus, I will
straighten everything out.

538
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,778
I promise. Ok?

539
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,328
Hi.

540
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,864
The research material you wanted.

541
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,935
You want to come in?

542
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,036
May I?

543
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,110
Oh, can I get you a drink or something?

544
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,045
Um, no, thanks.

545
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,381
Wow, um, this is a nice place.

546
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:45,716
Yeah.

547
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,885
You live here by yourself?

548
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,391
That's my roommate.

549
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:57,361
So uh, something on your mind?

550
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,063
I know that your bosses were
pretty harsh on you today.

551
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,804
I want you to know that...

552
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,942
I believe in you!

553
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,258
Jeez...

554
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,904
Amanda? Hi. It's Sam.

555
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,809
Yeah, uh, listen, I uh...

556
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,946
I think you were right
about the construction workers.

557
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:52,916
So the uh, the backup apartment you mentioned...

558
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,452
Ok, tell the manager we'll be in
the neighborhood,

559
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:56,887
and whenever he's free...

560
00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:00,457
Yeah, I can pick you up.
Where do you live?

561
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,161
Are you hungry, Katie?

562
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,863
You want a snack?

563
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,533
What do you want to eat?

564
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,346
Did you see that?

565
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,982
Relax. At least
she's speaking again.

566
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,216
Yeah. Only in chinese.

567
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,285
I guess that rules out our whole
hearing problem thing,

568
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,821
you're really crazy, do you know that?

569
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:33,924
Oh, God. I wish I'd scheduled
Sam for tomorrow.

570
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,226
You should have told him
to go find his own apartment.

571
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,828
Oh, right, what was I supposed to do,

572
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,229
just drop him after he apologized to me?

573
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,464
Uh-huh.

574
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,132
I'm fighting for business as it is.

575
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,600
The last thing I need is somebody out there

576
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,035
spreading bad word-of-mouth.

577
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,169
And we all know the most difficult clients

578
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:49,139
have the biggest mouths. Sam.

579
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,574
You are punctual.

580
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,142
Yeah. Well, your door was open.

581
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,179
- Hi. Good to see you again.
- Hey, Sam.

582
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,315
Good luck with your apartment search.

583
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,517
Thanks.

584
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,352
Well, I feel like I'm back in the States here.

585
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,688
Yeah. We make it work.

586
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,524
Speaking of we...

587
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,626
Sam, this is Katie.
Katie, say hi, to Sam.

588
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,463
She stopped speaking english. I
have no idea why.

589
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,969
Hi, Katie. Wow.

590
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,339
That is a really cool shovel.

591
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,941
What's it for?

592
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,244
Is it a secret?

593
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,912
Yeah. I bet it is.

594
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,414
How about this...

595
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,318
I'll tell you a really cool,
a really funny secret of mine

596
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,953
if you tell me what the shovel's for.

597
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,629
Pretty funny, huh?

598
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,663
So what's the shovel for?

599
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,999
I'm digging a hole to America.

600
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,303
What did you just say?

601
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,574
No, come on, seriously.
What did you just say to her?

602
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:02,112
It's uh, an attorney-client
privilege. I shouldn't.

603
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,582
That's how you want to play it?
Real cute.

604
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,150
Okay, look. I gotta ask.

605
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,685
What did you say to Katie back at the house?

606
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:11,254
I mean, she has not said one word of english

607
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,656
in over a week, and no offense,
but you're kind of

608
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:14,424
the last person in the world I expected

609
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,258
to have a way with kids.

610
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,693
So why did she...?

611
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,063
Never mind.

612
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,631
No, I'm listening.
Go ahead. Sorry.

613
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,000
Really? What did I just say?

614
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,602
I'm sorry.
I'm not listening.

615
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,671
No, it's just I'm kind of dealing

616
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,406
with this career-ending
crisis at work.

617
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,941
And it's really...

618
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,275
- Sounds serious.
- Yeah.

619
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,111
You know, if you need help,
there's a guy you could call.

620
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,679
Awesome wang.

621
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,149
He's a Shanghai hero.

622
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,351
He helps people out of trouble all of the time.

623
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,695
Right. So I've heard. Mm-hmm.

624
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,966
Hey, listen, are you, um, are you hungry?

625
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,434
Can I buy you lunch?

626
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,735
While we're waiting for the manager to call?

627
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,270
My treat.

628
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,705
Let me make up

629
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,141
for that little temper tantrum
I threw the other day.

630
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,144
Okay.

631
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:08,345
Okay.

632
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,399
Thank you.

633
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,702
Why does she keep giving me--

634
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:35,405
because I obviously don't speak
chinese, and you obviously do.

635
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,640
- Right.
- Happens all the time.

636
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,209
Here, take my menu, it's in english.

637
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,710
I gotta learn this stuff.

638
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:52,022
So how does a girl like you get
to be such an expert on China?

639
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:54,191
Well, I took 3 years of mandarin in college

640
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,126
and studied at beijing
university for a semester.

641
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,528
I even spent summers working at a
chinese restaurant in Nebraska,

642
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,530
to keep up my language skills.

643
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,065
Customers got a real kick out of me.

644
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:05,202
- I bet.
- Mm-hmm.

645
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:08,538
So, is that why you moved here
with Katie after the...

646
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,807
Yeah, Katie's dad wasn't exactly
¿father of the year

647
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,210
so after we split, I decided
to get away from him

648
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,511
as far as possible.

649
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,247
Yeah, this would pretty much do it.

650
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,683
I know. I know, I know,

651
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,718
but I knew the language and growing up here

652
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,187
will open up all sorts of job
opportunities for Katie.

653
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:26,123
So it made sense.

654
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,724
One of those moms, huh?

655
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:31,528
Guilty. So let me guess.

656
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,797
You only moved here because someone offered you

657
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:35,332
a big promotion.

658
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,600
I've seen your type before.

659
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:40,070
My type? I'm sorry,
what is my, my type?

660
00:35:40,072 --> 00:35:42,339
No, I have said way too much already.

661
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,807
No, no. I won't get mad.
You can tell me.

662
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,242
I can take it.

663
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:46,610
What is my type?

664
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:47,878
Ok.

665
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:53,316
Slick businessman.
Charming, driven,

666
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,719
you come here to do business,
but you still want to be

667
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:57,087
perceived as an American company,

668
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,389
so you downplay your association
with China as much as you can.

669
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:00,824
In fact, you downplay it so much

670
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,392
that nobody thinks about the actual human beings

671
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:03,527
who make your product.

672
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:05,428
Until, of course, something awful happens

673
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,130
and it winds up all over the news.

674
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,198
So you make a few changes

675
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,833
hope that your customers have a short memory.

676
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,735
Or if you're a real jerk, you just pretend

677
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,537
you had no idea it was happening
in your own factory

678
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,571
and blame everything on the chinese.

679
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,474
I know this story. I think I do.

680
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:18,608
Corporations are evil,

681
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,843
and we don't care about people, right?

682
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,646
What about the jobs we create?

683
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,783
The technology transfer
from building plants here?

684
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,485
No credit for that? Nothing?

685
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:29,886
Please. That's not charity work.

686
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:31,321
It's another way for you to make money.

687
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,390
Amanda, do you know how many designer shops

688
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,358
and luxury car dealerships I passed today

689
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,626
on the way over here?

690
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,129
Trust me, the chinese are making
plenty of money.

691
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,463
Yes, international trade

692
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,898
has definitely improved
the quality of life here.

693
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,600
But it's a side effect.

694
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:45,335
Foreign businessmen don't come here

695
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:46,770
to contribute to chinese society.

696
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,271
They come here to profit from it.

697
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,472
I'm contributing.

698
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,640
Ok, how?

699
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,809
By practicing law.

700
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,478
My client is just like you.
He loves China.

701
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,147
He wants to take a chinese inventor's product

702
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:58,682
and turn it into the biggest thing in the world,

703
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,884
and he needs my help to do that.
Do you understand this?

704
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,154
That's what I do. I help people.

705
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:06,256
Whatever you say.

706
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,160
All right. How about this.

707
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,795
You come by my office.

708
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:14,197
Watch how I'm going to fix this little hiccup

709
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,800
with my client and get him back
doing business again.

710
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,169
Then you'll see what I mean.

711
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,437
We'll see.

712
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,825
Hmm. Decided to come by
after all, huh?

713
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,060
Yeah. I was in the neighborhood.

714
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:40,697
I have some apartment photos
I wanted to show you.

715
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:41,831
Yeah.

716
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,199
Marcus, this is my colleague Amanda.

717
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,701
She's going to be sitting in with us today.

718
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:45,969
Hi.

719
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,237
- Hi.
- Come on in.

720
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,212
Who is that woman?

721
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,480
She's my guest.

722
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,049
You shouldn't bring a guest to a meeting.

723
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,684
It's unprofessional.

724
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,953
Thanks for your opinion.

725
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,769
Well, this must be Mr. Lin.

726
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,672
Yeah. It looks like
he brought some muscle.

727
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,046
Jason studied law at Stanford.

728
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,786
Huh. You look familiar.

729
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,187
I had a friend went to Stanford law.

730
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:39,556
Joey pritikin. You know him?

731
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:41,524
Let's just get to business, shall we?

732
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,560
All right.

733
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:46,229
This mobile phone is intellectual property

734
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:49,132
exclusively licensed
to my client by Mr. yu baiyang.

735
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,769
This identical mobile phone,

736
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:55,939
was manufactured by Mr. Lin
in his factory,

737
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:58,174
and we actually bought this
just down the street here

738
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,076
in a really cute, little shop.

739
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,947
So your client is clearly infringing

740
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,081
on my client's rights.

741
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,283
No. No.

742
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:08,785
This is not true.

743
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:10,787
I am the only one with permission

744
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,855
to make yu baiyang's phone.

745
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,791
Show them.

746
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,703
Hmm. You realize just because
you have a signed contract

747
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,171
doesn't make it valid.

748
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,073
Yu baiyang executed my client's agreement

749
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:31,808
on the 18th of this month.

750
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:36,846
And according to your contract,
he executed yours on the 19th.

751
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:40,049
And since an exclusive license
agreement is singular by definition,

752
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:43,886
the fact that ours is first
in time renders yours...

753
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:45,288
Completely void.

754
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,666
Impossible.

755
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,067
This is impossible.

756
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,836
These contracts make no sense.

757
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,171
In my opinion, we should do nothing

758
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,874
until yu baiyang resurfaces to clear this up.

759
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,876
Is that what they taught you at Stanford law?

760
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,882
If Mr. Lin
keeps his factory running,

761
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,984
he will be intentionally
breaching my client's contract,

762
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,085
and the next phone call I make

763
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,954
will be to file an injunction against him

764
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,355
under prc civil procedure law.

765
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,090
So let's keep this simple, Stanford.

766
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:24,027
Either Mr. Lin
stops making the phones,

767
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:26,329
or we Sue him for everything he's got.

768
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,168
Oh, God.

769
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,906
I'm advising my client to stop his operation.

770
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:38,274
There's no need to Sue.

771
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,948
Sam chao.
There is no substitute.

772
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,617
I told you not to worry.

773
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:51,287
How about this guy?

774
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:52,622
So what did you think?

775
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:53,690
I think you were born to be a lawyer.

776
00:44:53,692 --> 00:44:55,124
Come on.

777
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:56,859
I just got my client back on the road

778
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,061
to doing business here in China.

779
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,829
It was very easy, since Lin's attorney

780
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,631
was not too well-versed
in trade law.

781
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:03,700
But my point is this...

782
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,769
I stood up for justice back there.

783
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:08,838
Ah. You're a super hero.

784
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,640
What?

785
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,642
I'm just trying to figure out
which is the real you.

786
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:14,644
The nice guy who made my daughter feel

787
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,079
completely at ease,

788
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:19,215
or the carpetbagger who honestly
thinks he just helped someone.

789
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,416
I did just help someone.

790
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,385
And that clinches it. Uh-huh.

791
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,078
Hey!

792
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,750
Hey!

793
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:14,070
Out of the way!

794
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,357
Coming through!!

795
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,059
Brakes. Brakes. Brakes!

796
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,795
Brakes!! Brakes!!

797
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:40,463
Brakes!!!

798
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,305
Excuse me. Damn it.

799
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,481
Coming through. Coming through.

800
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,494
Move! Move! Move!

801
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,479
What the hell is going on here?

802
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,949
How did you catch me with that
piece of rubbish bicycle?

803
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,084
Spinning class three times a week, bitch.

804
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:36,786
Why the hell were you in that jfc commercial?

805
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:37,987
Are you a lawyer or not?

806
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,288
Yes. Of course I'm a lawyer.

807
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,557
Stop lying to me.
Who the hell are you?

808
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,861
I'm an actor, okay?

809
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,229
Actor?

810
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:49,165
What do you mean, this whole
meeting with Lin was fake?

811
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,299
Yes.

812
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:53,069
He just wanted to get you off his back.

813
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:55,204
Look out, someone's stealing your briefcase!

814
00:48:01,913 --> 00:48:03,346
The fake lawyer trick?

815
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:05,248
I haven't seen that one in years.

816
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,183
This guy Lin must be old school.

817
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:09,986
Sounds like the young buck's
finally ready to listen

818
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:11,387
to an old man's advice.

819
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,560
Hey, you.

820
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,195
Hey.

821
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:21,430
Fought any good battles for justice recently?

822
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,332
Uh, haven't you heard?
I'm only out for myself.

823
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,500
Oh.

824
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,835
Heading to a party?

825
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:28,337
Eh, more like a date.

826
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,239
Wow.

827
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,874
Some kind of angel for you to go out with him.

828
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:33,476
I wouldn't know.
It's a blind date.

829
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:36,579
Some french banker Natalie
set me up with. Don't ask.

830
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,050
You still want to know what I said to Katie?

831
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,486
What happened
to attorney-client privilege?

832
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:44,921
She's a horrible client.
Never pays her bills.

833
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,889
- Mm-hmm.

834
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,291
You want to know or not?

835
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:49,992
Yes. What did you say?

836
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,094
That the only word I know how to say in chinese

837
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:55,865
is fang pi. Fart.

838
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:57,233
Yeah, no. I got it.

839
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:58,534
Yeah.

840
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,202
Okay. So how did that...

841
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:04,407
By letting her know she's not
the only weirdo around.

842
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:06,008
It's not easy growing up in a place

843
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,276
where nobody looks like you.

844
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,544
Uh-huh.

845
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,546
And kids, they just want to fit in.

846
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:13,282
And all of the other kids,
they only speak chinese.

847
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,618
So...

848
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,988
How do you think I wound up
speaking only english?

849
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:22,625
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

850
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,627
Because it was obvious. Ow.

851
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,562
Walk it off.

852
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,397
So where are you headed, anyway?

853
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:30,566
I'm uh...

854
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:32,568
Heading to meet the legendary awesome wang.

855
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,370
I thought you had that all figured out.

856
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:35,671
I thought I did, too.

857
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,573
But it just seems like every time I turn around,

858
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,343
the rug just keeps getting
pulled out from under me.

859
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:43,446
And it feels like everyone is out to get me.

860
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:45,047
You really shouldn't talk about
your people that way.

861
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:47,683
Look, it's like, I am...

862
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,585
Totally out of my element here.

863
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:52,021
That lawyer from yesterday?
Not a lawyer.

864
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:54,523
Taxi drivers don't understand a word I'm saying.

865
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,993
Oh, and I just found out
about the business card thing.

866
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,161
I go to a meeting, I'm supposed
to hand out my business card,

867
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:02,698
apparently, you're supposed to use two hands

868
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,534
and bow at the same time.
And I know it's a little thing,

869
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:08,270
but I'm used to doing things my
way, and I had to think about it,

870
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:11,173
and if I have to think about
every single little thing,

871
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,341
it's uh...

872
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,243
Sounds like somebody's going expat crazy.

873
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,146
At least you know how your parents felt.

874
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,482
They were immigrants, right?

875
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,384
Ok, well, at some point they up and moved

876
00:50:21,386 --> 00:50:22,952
to a foreign country for better
jobs and a better life.

877
00:50:22,954 --> 00:50:26,288
And they figured it out.

878
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,723
We Americans like to call ourselves expats,

879
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:30,693
but the fact of the matter is we're immigrants.

880
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,096
This is my stop.

881
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:36,065
Good luck.

882
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:39,368
Thanks. Good luck to you too.

883
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,394
Hi. You must be awesome.
I'm Sam.

884
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,832
Sam?

885
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:34,490
So...You're...Awesome wang.

886
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,735
Tell me what you need help with.

887
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,704
Donald said that you're great at finding people.

888
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,776
So, there's this manufacturer,
his name is Lin...

889
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:06,055
He, he's violating my client's
product license agreement.

890
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:07,623
So I met with Lin,

891
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,891
and he--

892
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,735
so I meet with Lin and his lawyer,

893
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,571
but his lawyer turns out to be some actor.

894
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:34,583
He--he turns out to be
a british actor.

895
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:35,851
His name is Jensen.

896
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:41,090
And now I can't--
now I can't find Lin anywhere.

897
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,793
Hey, excuse me, can we go someplace

898
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,662
a little more private?
I feel like privacy's an issue.

899
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,499
Anybody here understand this guy?

900
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:55,271
I think you are okay.

901
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,177
So anyway, I can't find Lin anywhere,

902
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,445
and I have jen-- I have
Jensen's phone number.

903
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,182
He was in a jfc ad, so Donald
helped me get this.

904
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,783
I was gonna give him a call, but...

905
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,004
My daughter. She is two.

906
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,575
She's adorable.

907
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,712
It was very nice to meet you.

908
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,849
Nice to meet all of you.

909
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,386
Found Jensen.

910
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,440
What is this place?

911
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,608
Ktv.

912
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,210
What?

913
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,611
Ktv.

914
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,382
Ktv is english.

915
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:47,783
No.

916
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,992
Are you saying karaoke?

917
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,560
So how are we supposed to find him?

918
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,062
This place is huge.

919
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:06,702
Hello? Wei?

920
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:07,903
Hello, Jensen.

921
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,305
This is wang geili.

922
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,441
The reporter who texted you earlier.

923
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,576
<i>Right. Sorry, mate.</i>

924
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:17,012
<i>But I changed my mind</i>
<i>about doing that interview.</i>

925
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,982
Uh, you don't say.

926
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,384
May I ask why?

927
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:26,255
<i>Honestly? There's this</i>
<i>wanker I'm trying to avoid.</i>

928
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:28,457
Uh-huh. Interesting.

929
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:29,892
<i>He's some lawyer from the States.</i>

930
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:31,493
Oh, from the States?

931
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,729
<i>I don't need him seeing my name in print</i>

932
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:34,963
<i>all over the press</i>
<i>anytime soon.</i>

933
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,966
Oh, that's too bad.
Your story's interesting.

934
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:39,568
I still want to talk to you.

935
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,906
<i>Well, thank you.</i>
<i>I can't right now,</i>

936
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:46,709
<i>but if you're still looking</i>
<i>to interview a foreign actor,</i>

937
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:51,280
<i>then give me a call later,</i>
<i>and I'd be happy to.</i>

938
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:52,748
<i>Okay? Cheers, mate.</i>

939
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,017
Goodbye.

940
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:02,291
Wow. You are an actor, a lawyer,
and a singer.

941
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:03,892
That is really impressive.

942
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:06,295
- Do we have to do this here? -
Yes, we do.

943
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:07,496
I don't know where he is.

944
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:10,766
My reporter friend here works for
some very widely read newspapers

945
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:12,468
in Shanghai, so unless you want
everyone to know--

946
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,702
hey.

947
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,805
Fang fang?

948
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:18,307
You know her?

949
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:19,641
She's my assistant!

950
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,043
You don't say.

951
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,046
What the hell are you doing here?

952
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:38,026
They're about to lie to you, buddy.

953
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:39,395
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

954
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,401
Uh, Jason...

955
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,125
700 dagu road, apartment 1804.

956
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:11,760
That's where he lives.

957
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,845
So...Working
at a nightclub, huh?

958
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:33,749
How long has that been going on?

959
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,551
Having trouble understanding me tonight?

960
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,119
Is that what it is?

961
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,720
You can't really understand
what I'm saying? Is that it?

962
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:40,189
Am I speaking too fast or too slow?

963
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,993
Damn it, fang fang, I'm your boss.

964
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:46,395
If I ask you a question

965
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:48,464
regarding your employment
status, you have to answer me.

966
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:49,965
Do you understand that?

967
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,135
How long have you had a second job?

968
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,903
Waitressing is not my second job.

969
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,171
Oh, great. So now
you're lying to me.

970
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:57,673
It's my first job.

971
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,143
Working for you is my second job.

972
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:03,078
What are you talking about?

973
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,013
I thought your parents were rich or something.

974
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,086
My father is a construction worker.

975
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,688
My mom cleans houses.

976
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,756
When I was hired at your firm, I thought,

977
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:17,092
I could quit the nightclub.

978
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:20,429
But even in Shanghai, there's so much pressure.

979
00:58:20,431 --> 00:58:24,132
Every woman with an office job
has to have designer clothes,

980
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:27,603
and nice jewelry, and italian handbags.

981
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:30,606
So, I pretend to have wealthy parents,

982
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:35,043
and kept my other job
just to pay for nice things, ok?

983
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:38,881
Well, I guess that explains all of the flirting.

984
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,949
Flirting?

985
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:42,718
Come on.

986
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,988
You have been making eyes at me
since the day I arrived.

987
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,456
You came to my house.

988
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,525
You got upset when Amanda
showed up at the meeting.

989
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,059
And you just think I'm going to take you

990
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:52,895
right back to New York with me, don't you?

991
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:56,698
I tell you my secret, and you accuse me of this?

992
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:00,202
I want you to succeed in this job.

993
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:05,741
And act professional so the office stays open!

994
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:09,878
And I can go to law school
and take care of my family.

995
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,780
You're just...

996
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,683
You don't understand anything.

997
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,588
Screw you, Sam. I quit.

998
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,571
I don't want to talk about it.

999
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,640
Did you find Lin or not?

1000
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,216
Couldn't get in?

1001
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,920
Awesome, I told you that uniform sucks.

1002
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,161
Come on. It's not a big deal.

1003
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,829
Stay the hell away from me.

1004
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,864
- Amanda. What's going on?
- My date? He's married.

1005
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:04,132
He's not looking for a relationship,

1006
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,634
he's looking to cheat on his wife.

1007
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:07,169
No, no, no, no.
It's not what you think it is.

1008
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:09,304
I love my wife very much.

1009
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:10,806
Then why are you on a date with me?

1010
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:12,908
Because I promised her

1011
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,242
I wouldn't have an affair with a chinese woman.

1012
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,944
Seriously?
That's your reasoning?

1013
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,980
Yes, I'm a man.

1014
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,082
Living thousands of kilometers
away from his wife.

1015
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,316
I have needs.

1016
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:22,884
Oh...

1017
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:24,319
- So do you, yes?
- Buddy.

1018
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,222
She's not interested.
So why don't you back off.

1019
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:28,957
Or what? Hmm?

1020
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,327
Walk away.

1021
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:36,231
Whatever.

1022
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,265
Are you okay?

1023
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,935
Yeah. I just...

1024
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,675
What's the matter?

1025
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:48,143
Do you know why people hire me?

1026
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,246
Because they see a single mom
getting by in Shanghai,

1027
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:52,848
and they think, now there's someone

1028
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,149
who has her act together.

1029
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,250
You do.

1030
01:00:55,252 --> 01:00:57,152
No. I don't.

1031
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,687
I live in a house I can barely afford.

1032
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,689
I wake up in the middle of the night

1033
01:01:00,691 --> 01:01:02,591
wondering who will take care of Katie

1034
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:03,959
if something were to happen to me.

1035
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:06,061
It'd be great to not have to do this on my own,

1036
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:10,265
but every time I go on a date,
it's, it's...That.

1037
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,268
Well, I guess that makes you a duck.

1038
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,836
What?

1039
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:22,044
My mom used to say

1040
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:25,247
that certain people were like ducks because...

1041
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,916
They make everything look easy.

1042
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:31,219
Out there on the water,

1043
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:32,954
it's like they don't have a care in the world.

1044
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:34,690
But if you look below the surface...

1045
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,026
You can see how hard their lives really are.

1046
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,633
Just paddling their little asses off.

1047
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:47,069
Just like that.

1048
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,972
You know that's a chinese saying, right?

1049
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,140
The duck thing.

1050
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,675
I think that's American.

1051
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:55,744
Oh, ok, who knows more about ducks?

1052
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:57,245
They eat millions of them in beijing.

1053
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,049
Good point.

1054
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:07,322
Ah, I must be more chinese than I thought.

1055
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,395
Come on.

1056
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:17,733
Thanks.

1057
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,872
Ok, let me make it up to you.

1058
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:58,006
No way.

1059
01:02:58,008 --> 01:02:59,107
But-

1060
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:00,375
no buts.
I'm done with expat guys.

1061
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:02,043
Ok, they've either got an asian fetish,

1062
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,311
or they're...

1063
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,447
Turkey vultures.

1064
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,215
That's what my friend calls them.

1065
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:09,117
Because they hover around,

1066
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,087
waiting to pick up the discarded white meat.

1067
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:13,188
Oh, God.

1068
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:14,456
Ow!

1069
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,227
I told you not to eat before a foot massage.

1070
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,862
She can feel everything.

1071
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:22,330
Ok...

1072
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:25,734
Now explain to me what Sam had to do with this.

1073
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:29,070
Sam's the one who chased Phillip away.

1074
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:33,041
By doing that thing guys do
when they're about to fight.

1075
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:36,111
And then out of nowhere,

1076
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:38,380
he just...Kissed me.

1077
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,182
Who, Phillip?

1078
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,417
No, Sam. Why would I let
Phillip kiss me?

1079
01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:44,152
I don't know.

1080
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,520
Why would you let Sam kiss you?

1081
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:48,156
I didn't. No.

1082
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,257
Stop it.

1083
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:50,859
He kissed you.

1084
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:53,028
After defending your honor.

1085
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:56,464
Oh, my God.
I knew he liked you.

1086
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,200
We're nothing alike.

1087
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:02,771
Exactly. Opposites,
like yin Yang.

1088
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:05,407
You know, you're warm, he is fierce.

1089
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,243
You are easygoing, he is driven.

1090
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:11,346
You are chinese, he is American.

1091
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,480
You know what else?

1092
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:14,950
I live here.
He's a short termer.

1093
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:17,519
The second his job is done, he's going home.

1094
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,421
Maybe he will change his plans.

1095
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:21,389
For God's sake, he gets along with Katie.

1096
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,792
And you need some romance in your life.

1097
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:26,194
No. I'm done with romance.
I was doing just--

1098
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,036
or maybe I just have sore feet.

1099
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,005
Anybody ever considered that?

1100
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,511
Just a reminder, we've got a meet and greet

1101
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,381
with commerce secretary whitson
on the evening of the 29th.

1102
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,316
It is the 29th, right?

1103
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,517
- Yeah.
- Good.

1104
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,319
He's gonna be in town for some meetings

1105
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,321
and some photo ops, so if
anyone's got any gripes,

1106
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,257
about trade subsidies, here's your chance

1107
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,492
to have some face time with the man.

1108
01:04:57,494 --> 01:04:58,894
I'm talking to you, Janet.

1109
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,328
I love you, too, Donald.

1110
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,863
Now it's time to turn things over to Ted holmby.

1111
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:03,498
Who's got this year's amcham election results.

1112
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,567
Is this seat taken?

1113
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:07,235
No, no. Please, sit.

1114
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,112
I didn't know you were coming to this thing.

1115
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:20,248
Yeah. Donald called me
this morning.

1116
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,450
I thought I should come.
Show him my support.

1117
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:23,618
Same.

1118
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,120
Yeah.

1119
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:27,389
It's the closest election they said in years.

1120
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,624
Yeah. Yep.

1121
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,626
So...

1122
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:33,862
Close. Close.

1123
01:05:33,864 --> 01:05:36,498
So how'd it go with um, awesome wang?

1124
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,069
I may just uh, dig myself out of this hole.

1125
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,239
I'm just waiting for him to call.

1126
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,373
That's great.

1127
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,608
Yeah.

1128
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:52,113
How'd it go with the um, the french guy?

1129
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,281
- Uh, Phillip?
- Yeah.

1130
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,649
Yeah. No more trouble.

1131
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,051
I think you scared him off pretty good.

1132
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:58,553
Good.

1133
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:01,623
Not that scaring people is a good thing.

1134
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,459
I'm just, I'm glad you're...Ok.

1135
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:11,132
Hey, listen, if I overstepped
any boundaries last night...

1136
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,501
Three months, is that set in stone?

1137
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:16,504
Because, you know, sometimes people stay longer.

1138
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,175
Maybe.

1139
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:23,511
I mean, I could see myself staying.

1140
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,980
A little bit longer.

1141
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:29,384
Okay.

1142
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,721
Okay.

1143
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,463
Wow.

1144
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:42,731
Thank you.

1145
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,101
Wait. What just happened?

1146
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:48,136
Esther wu is the new mayor of americatown.

1147
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:51,439
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1148
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:54,409
This is such a surprise.

1149
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:56,378
I was not expecting this at all.

1150
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,279
Way to go, Esther!

1151
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:01,950
Thank you so much.
This is a great day.

1152
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:05,353
Donald. Donald!

1153
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:07,455
48 percent.

1154
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:08,523
That's it?

1155
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,624
Yeah.

1156
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:10,959
I thought everyone loved him.

1157
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,460
They do, or they did.

1158
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,363
I guess that times are finally
catching up with him.

1159
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,298
I should go check on him.

1160
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,100
See if I can get the mayor of canadatown

1161
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:20,468
to come cheer him up.

1162
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,704
That's a good idea.

1163
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,607
Listen, I have tickets to this
American film festival--

1164
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:29,077
next week. I'm pretty sure
all the films are in english.

1165
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,345
But I didn't know if maybe
you weren't too busy--

1166
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:31,980
if you'd want to...Go.

1167
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:33,214
It's awesome.

1168
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,449
Oh.

1169
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:36,651
I mean, awesome wang.
He's calling me. Uh, I gotta--

1170
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:40,422
right. No, dig yourself
out of that...Hole.

1171
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,991
Uh, but the movie, that sounds uh, awesome, too.

1172
01:07:42,993 --> 01:07:44,325
So, I'll call you, ok?

1173
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:46,227
Yeah, do that.
That'd be awe... some.

1174
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,996
Ok.

1175
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:49,731
Hey. Did you find him?

1176
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,335
English, awesome.
I can't see you.

1177
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:55,637
You have to speak english.

1178
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:58,540
I got into the building.

1179
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:01,276
It does not seem like the kind of place

1180
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,578
where a sneaky businessman would live.

1181
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,513
Great. So Jensen lied
about the address.

1182
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:07,682
Or Lin is not who we think he is.

1183
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,350
Are you sure of your facts, Sam?

1184
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,352
He had an actor pose as his lawyer, awesome.

1185
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:12,720
That's all I need to know.

1186
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:14,289
So what the hell do we do now?

1187
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,092
Sorry. I'm out of ideas.

1188
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,620
I'm starting to think this isn't
the most effective strategy.

1189
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,821
I know, Brad! I get it!

1190
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,171
Mr. chao.

1191
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,306
New York is starting video call soon.

1192
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,849
Can I help you, guang?

1193
01:09:14,851 --> 01:09:17,685
Fang fang quit because she loved you,

1194
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:19,354
and you broke her heart.

1195
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,689
You chose that American woman instead.

1196
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:24,359
You are a rotten radish!

1197
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,828
What?

1198
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,400
It's not funny.

1199
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:39,507
Please tell me you're opening
an electronics store.

1200
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,643
No, sir. I am not.

1201
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:46,181
Uh, these are the phones that Lin is producing.

1202
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:49,384
I've been going around,
buying as many as I can find

1203
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:50,919
to keep them off the street.

1204
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:54,722
This is not good, Sam.

1205
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:57,192
Not good for the firm,
and certainly not for you.

1206
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:58,893
Get on the first flight back to New York.

1207
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:01,563
We need to have a face to face
discussion about your future.

1208
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,307
Maybe you should go on a vacation.

1209
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:13,374
I hate vacations.

1210
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,577
Ok, well, make it exciting.
How about a safari?

1211
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:16,744
Oh, you should go to Bangkok.

1212
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,780
I know this really hot masseuse there.

1213
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,215
Her name's Kevin.

1214
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,888
This doesn't look good.

1215
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:30,558
It's not. I'm uh...

1216
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,327
I got called back to New York.

1217
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:33,861
You're leaving already?

1218
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,730
Yeah. My flight's
in a few hours.

1219
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,900
I thought I should come by
and say goodbye before I left.

1220
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,969
Amanda, can I talk to you
for a minute in private?

1221
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,010
All right. Ok.

1222
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,382
Donald.

1223
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:56,985
Good luck. Watch your back.

1224
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:05,960
I really was thinking about staying.

1225
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:07,262
Sure you were.

1226
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,265
I'm sorry, I...

1227
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,902
Look, I'm gonna go back
to New York. And uh...

1228
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:16,771
And what?

1229
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,873
You knew exactly what I was
asking you the other night.

1230
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,875
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?

1231
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:22,710
I swear, I didn't know I was leaving.

1232
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:24,045
I did.

1233
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,615
Sooner or later, you were always going home.

1234
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,752
You seem troubled.

1235
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,590
May I ask why?

1236
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:22,497
It's complicated.

1237
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:25,733
I came here to China

1238
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,368
because I thought it would help my career.

1239
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,836
And now my career is over.

1240
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:30,872
So thanks for everything, China.

1241
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:45,119
Sorry. I probably shouldn't be
sarcastic to you.

1242
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,621
I judge not.

1243
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:49,657
Surely there was something you
enjoyed during your stay here.

1244
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:51,526
Yeah, there was.

1245
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,428
But she's pissed at me.

1246
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,029
Ah. A woman, huh?

1247
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:56,998
Yeah.

1248
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,866
Not exactly your area of
expertise, I'm guessing.

1249
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,839
Right. Well...

1250
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,442
Anyway, there's no use in obsessing over it.

1251
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:08,676
I'm never going to see her again, so...

1252
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,077
One never knows what the future holds.

1253
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,147
I know. Trust me, I know.

1254
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,051
Do you see this bean here?

1255
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,924
It was once just a pit of a small berry.

1256
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,496
Left undisturbed,

1257
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,997
it would have remained so.

1258
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:32,133
But being plucked from its Shell,

1259
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,001
scorched in flame...

1260
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,405
Crushed into powder...

1261
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:41,509
And boiled in water
transforms this into something

1262
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:45,746
far more delicious, and far more meaningful,

1263
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:49,116
than just a mere pit.

1264
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:52,520
A little confused. Um...

1265
01:14:52,522 --> 01:14:54,055
About everything you just said.

1266
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,426
Am I the coffee bean?
Is that what you're...

1267
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:01,095
Am I the pit?

1268
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:03,865
I'm the pit, I gotta get all burned and boiled

1269
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,066
and all that stuff before I can become the bean?

1270
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:06,701
Is that it?

1271
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,537
Ok, listen, I've been through all that.

1272
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:11,138
I've been boiled, I've been burned,

1273
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,908
I lost my job, and I lost the girl.

1274
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,176
And after all that...

1275
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,912
I'm still a pit.

1276
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,617
Wait a minute.

1277
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,953
That's it.

1278
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,524
Amanda.

1279
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,562
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1280
01:15:34,564 --> 01:15:36,597
I feel like I should give you
a donation or something.

1281
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,533
Donation?

1282
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:39,634
Yeah. 'Cause you're a monk.

1283
01:15:39,636 --> 01:15:42,303
Why do all Americans think I am a monk?

1284
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:46,507
I just enjoy wearing robes and giving advice.

1285
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:50,044
Not all bald men in China is a monk, you know?

1286
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,786
No, no, no. Whatever it is,
I'm not helping you.

1287
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:00,655
All I have is Lin's home address.

1288
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:02,857
If you could just look through
your real estate database--

1289
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,825
you're not my client anymore.

1290
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:05,793
Then I'm here to hire you.

1291
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:07,562
No, I am.
I want to buy Lin's apartment.

1292
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:10,598
And I can't contact him
without his phone number, right?

1293
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,899
Come on.

1294
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,938
I'm sorry. I'm trying to become
a coffee bean here.

1295
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:17,738
What?

1296
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,307
I don't know. Never mind.

1297
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,276
I admit it, okay?

1298
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:24,278
I only came here to make partner.

1299
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:28,783
A selfish prick who will step
on anyone to get what he wants?

1300
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,184
Take it easy.

1301
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:32,219
My point is, I don't want to be
that guy anymore.

1302
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:34,722
And proving that to you is going
take more than the three hours

1303
01:16:34,724 --> 01:16:36,591
that I have left before my flight takes off.

1304
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,659
So please, just help me find this guy.

1305
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,130
It's my only shot at buying a
little more time here with you.

1306
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,336
Give me the address.

1307
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,206
No. Come inside.

1308
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,213
Okay, Lin, Lin, Lin.

1309
01:16:59,215 --> 01:17:00,815
I am not seeing any phone numbers,

1310
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,216
but it looks like he recently sold

1311
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:06,654
all right. Well, a lead's
a lead. I'll check it out.

1312
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:07,855
Wait. Hang on.
There's something else.

1313
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,157
He also just bought a commercial
property in changzhou.

1314
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,027
What is that, like a neighborhood or something?

1315
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:15,162
No. It's an industrial town
outside of Shanghai.

1316
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:18,666
Do they have factories there?

1317
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:19,900
Yeah, lots.

1318
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:23,304
In fact, it looks like this
one that he owns is a factory.

1319
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:24,639
Do you think?

1320
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,275
Yes. I do.

1321
01:17:28,277 --> 01:17:31,746
That's it! That's where
he's making the phones.

1322
01:17:31,748 --> 01:17:33,347
And you found it.
You are a lifesaver!

1323
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,317
Would you stop doing that?

1324
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,285
Ok, I'm sorry. I was excited.

1325
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,955
Just go, find Lin, ok?

1326
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:43,224
And give me time to think.

1327
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,159
Hello?

1328
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,894
Donald! Hey, hey, it's Sam.

1329
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:49,163
Listen, I know where Lin's factory is.

1330
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,731
Apparently he owns some industrial property

1331
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:53,100
in a place called uh,
chan-zoo.

1332
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:54,201
Changzhou.

1333
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,270
Right. Whatever they just said.

1334
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,938
Listen, I think I can still salvage this thing.

1335
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,808
How do I file an injunction against the factory?

1336
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,610
Changzhou is in the jiangsu province.

1337
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:05,112
You need to file a complaint
with the jiangsu administration

1338
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:06,814
of industry and commerce.

1339
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:07,948
Ok.

1340
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,084
Make an appointment, plead your case,

1341
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:11,919
and convince them to get a Magistrate out there

1342
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:14,855
to shut the plant down.
It might take a couple of weeks.

1343
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:17,024
Couple of weeks?
I don't have a couple of weeks.

1344
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,260
Can--there has to be
a faster way here.

1345
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:22,897
Not unless you have some guanxi
with the jiangsu aic.

1346
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,633
How am I gonna get that?

1347
01:18:25,635 --> 01:18:27,034
I have a cousin that works there.

1348
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,336
Donald, I'll call you back.

1349
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:32,073
You have a cousin, guang.
Are you serious?

1350
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,009
Listen to me, you just made my day.

1351
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:36,777
Please call him for me.

1352
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:39,380
The flowers are dying.

1353
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:41,782
Forget about the flowers.

1354
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:42,917
We're talking about cousins here.

1355
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:45,319
Can you please call him for me?

1356
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:46,687
I don't know.

1357
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:49,156
I am still upset with you for
toying with fang fang's heart.

1358
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:50,658
I didn't toy with fang fang's heart!

1359
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:53,094
There was nothing going on
between me and fang fang, ok?

1360
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:54,395
She was pissed at me because
because I was a jerk,

1361
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,830
and that's why she quit.

1362
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:58,065
That's the truth. Now please,
call your cousin for me.

1363
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,867
I am desperate.

1364
01:19:01,837 --> 01:19:03,504
How desperate?

1365
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,112
Hi. My name's Sam.
I'm looking for fang fang.

1366
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,416
I work with her.
I'm her boss actually.

1367
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,018
Uh, I have a business card.

1368
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:51,919
Oh, all right.

1369
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,972
What do you want?

1370
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,276
I'm sorry for insulting you the other day.

1371
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:21,382
It was condescending and rude...

1372
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:22,983
I was, I was way out of line.

1373
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,586
Yeah, right.
What do you want?

1374
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:29,356
I want you to go on a date with guang.

1375
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,760
Are you crazy?

1376
01:20:32,762 --> 01:20:34,361
Please, fang fang, I'll give you
anything you want.

1377
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,298
Anything.

1378
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,465
Anything.

1379
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,371
Hire me back.

1380
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:47,474
Done. That's...Done.

1381
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:50,811
Help me with my law school entrance exam.

1382
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:53,380
Help you with your law school entrance exam.

1383
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:55,482
Absolutely. I will help you.

1384
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:56,817
Now will you just...

1385
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:59,553
Please, go on a date with guang?

1386
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,793
Sam?

1387
01:21:05,795 --> 01:21:06,961
May I?

1388
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:08,195
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

1389
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:28,275
Whatever he said right there
I'm sure is really romantic.

1390
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,344
How about it, fang fang?
Just one date?

1391
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:39,286
What'd I tell you?

1392
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:44,558
So fang fang is faxing the contract evidence

1393
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,327
to jiangsu aic as we speak,

1394
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:47,494
so assuming everything is in order,

1395
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:49,663
they're sending a Magistrate to the factory.

1396
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,398
Sounds like you got this all wrapped up.

1397
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,502
Oh, guess who just drove here
in his new ride, bitches?

1398
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,305
I'm not just some horny english teacher anymore.

1399
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:00,341
I'm a horny english teacher with a car!

1400
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:01,408
You're still here.

1401
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,544
Yes, and I might be for a bit longer.

1402
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:05,546
But I need a favor.
I need a lift to changzhou.

1403
01:23:05,548 --> 01:23:07,114
So how about we take this new ride of yours

1404
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:08,315
for a test drive?

1405
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,616
I'd love to. Road trip!

1406
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,655
- He wants to come with.
- Great. Let's go.

1407
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,513
Whoa.

1408
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:24,458
Mr. Lin.

1409
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:27,161
Ah, good to see you again.
You look good.

1410
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,563
I have a Magistrate here.
He'd like to speak with you.

1411
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:45,379
Please, you can't do this.

1412
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:48,515
I spent all my family's money into this factory.

1413
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:51,185
And produce this phone.

1414
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:54,254
I'll be bankrupt if you shut it down.

1415
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,631
Yeah, dude.
Mission accomplished.

1416
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:44,471
The system worked.

1417
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,374
Yeah.
And Lin's out of business.

1418
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:53,247
And I am finally, finally out of trouble.

1419
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,154
What is that noise?

1420
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:03,357
The sound of trouble!

1421
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:05,092
Again, awesome, with the janitor disguise?

1422
01:26:05,094 --> 01:26:06,760
I told you this--

1423
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:08,095
listen. Lin told the head worker

1424
01:26:08,097 --> 01:26:09,429
to come and collect the severance pay.

1425
01:26:09,431 --> 01:26:11,532
Only you two look like you might have it.

1426
01:26:11,534 --> 01:26:13,367
So? I'll just tell them
that we don't work with Lin.

1427
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:29,750
We uh, we, we don't
work for...for Mr. Lin.

1428
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:32,152
I don't think he understands you, dude.

1429
01:26:32,154 --> 01:26:34,588
Yes, I can see that, Brad.
What do we do?

1430
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:36,523
- Run!
- Yeah!

1431
01:26:40,428 --> 01:26:44,665
There are so many.

1432
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:47,668
Go!!

1433
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:49,136
Go! Go!

1434
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:50,404
Get to the car!

1435
01:26:50,406 --> 01:26:52,206
I'm getting! I'm getting!
I'm getting!

1436
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,413
Get in! Get in!

1437
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:18,899
Thank you.

1438
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:23,003
Um...How'd it go?

1439
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,173
Couple of hiccups.

1440
01:27:26,175 --> 01:27:27,908
Mm-hmm.

1441
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,410
But um...

1442
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:31,945
We did it.

1443
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:33,180
Yeah?

1444
01:27:33,182 --> 01:27:34,581
Yeah.

1445
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,350
I'm glad you're here.

1446
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,253
You can see the new me.

1447
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:41,955
Did you get a hold of Marcus groff?

1448
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:43,357
Um, yes.

1449
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:44,458
Actually he just arrived.

1450
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,393
But there's no place to sit down in there

1451
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,695
because of all the damn phones.

1452
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:51,198
Now tell me why I shouldn't have
your firm dismantled

1453
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,566
and sold for scrap this very instant.

1454
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:54,201
Because I fixed everything.

1455
01:27:54,203 --> 01:27:56,403
Lin's factory has been shut down, Marcus.

1456
01:27:56,405 --> 01:27:58,572
It has?

1457
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:00,407
Yes. And I want you to know
that I take full responsibility

1458
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:03,243
and if anyone should to take
the fall, it should be me.

1459
01:28:03,245 --> 01:28:04,878
Not the people at firm,

1460
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,880
and not these wonderful people
here at the Shanghai office.

1461
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:08,815
Don't sweat it, man.

1462
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:11,818
Well...

1463
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,454
This turned out better than I had hoped.

1464
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,722
How's that?

1465
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:17,324
Lin thinks his contract isn't any good.

1466
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:19,559
Plus I get a shipping container full of phones

1467
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:21,261
he built on his own dime.

1468
01:28:21,263 --> 01:28:22,929
What do you mean Lin he thinks
his contract is no good?

1469
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:24,298
It is no good.

1470
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:35,342
Wait a second.
Is that yu baiyang?

1471
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:41,248
He said something didn't feel right

1472
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,649
when he went to Lin's apartment.

1473
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:46,053
So he went to find the inventor.

1474
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,392
Your client lied to you.
Like big time.

1475
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,828
Mr. yu. Hello again.

1476
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,498
I can see you're busy.
No problem.

1477
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,966
If I can just get you...

1478
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:03,003
To sign this contract we discussed.

1479
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:04,671
About the phone?

1480
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:09,643
No. I promised my shareholders

1481
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:11,278
I had something big in the pipeline.

1482
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,846
I was going to pay you a lot of money for it.

1483
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,379
Sam? It's Marcus groff.

1484
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:46,947
We've got a problem.

1485
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:49,916
Marcus. Is this true?
Is Lin innocent?

1486
01:29:49,918 --> 01:29:51,685
He's not innocent.

1487
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:53,653
He hired an actor to pose as his attorney

1488
01:29:53,655 --> 01:29:56,390
because he could not afford a real attorney.

1489
01:29:56,392 --> 01:29:57,591
After starting up his business.

1490
01:29:57,593 --> 01:29:59,993
I spent all my family's money into this factory.

1491
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:02,929
I'll be bankrupt if you shut it down.

1492
01:30:02,931 --> 01:30:04,698
What's done is done.

1493
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,400
You lied to me, Marcus.

1494
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,769
You used me to cheat an innocent
man out of a huge business deal.

1495
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:10,003
You realize that?

1496
01:30:10,005 --> 01:30:13,006
Relax. Groff technologies
is going to make

1497
01:30:13,008 --> 01:30:14,474
a billion dollars next year,

1498
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:16,777
and that means more business for your firm.

1499
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:20,614
I'm gonna send over a truck
to pick up these phones, ok?

1500
01:30:20,616 --> 01:30:21,915
It's nice working with you, Sam.

1501
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,085
Bye.

1502
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:30,791
Hello? Powell and Davies.

1503
01:30:30,793 --> 01:30:32,592
One moment please.

1504
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:37,030
New York is calling to see why
you didn't get on that plane.

1505
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,434
What are you going to tell them?

1506
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,577
Don't think about it too hard, Sam.

1507
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:51,912
You know what to do.

1508
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:52,946
Actually, I don't.

1509
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,881
Marcus groff's company pays your salary.

1510
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:57,150
He's one of our most valuable clients.

1511
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,119
There are plenty of other clients out there.

1512
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:01,021
This guy Lin, he could use representation.

1513
01:31:01,023 --> 01:31:03,390
Groff has the infrastructure and the resources

1514
01:31:03,392 --> 01:31:06,760
to revolutionize the computing
industry with this technology,

1515
01:31:06,762 --> 01:31:09,062
and you want to side with
a backyard operation like Lin?

1516
01:31:09,064 --> 01:31:11,932
Sam. Just remember
which team you play for.

1517
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:14,067
Which team is that exactly?

1518
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:16,470
You guys sent me out here because I'm chinese.

1519
01:31:16,472 --> 01:31:17,904
You wanted someone who could
connect with the people.

1520
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:19,005
My people.

1521
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:20,507
And now you want me to screw one of them.

1522
01:31:20,509 --> 01:31:22,609
Oh, when the hell did you care who gets screwed?

1523
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:24,177
Sam.

1524
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:26,880
You know what groff is worth to us.

1525
01:31:26,882 --> 01:31:28,615
And we know what making partner
would mean to you.

1526
01:31:28,617 --> 01:31:32,586
So just give groff the phones,
and everybody wins.

1527
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,928
I met some pretty famous
attorneys in law school.

1528
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:45,131
Guys I modeled my career after.

1529
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:48,568
And I'm pretty sure none of them
would understand

1530
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,136
what I'm doing.

1531
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:59,179
You are an honorable man.

1532
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,918
No. I'm just a coffee bean.

1533
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:08,255
Ready?

1534
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:11,124
Yeah.

1535
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:15,262
I'll take that.

1536
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:18,732
<i>Sam often thought</i>

1537
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:20,767
<i>he might open</i>
<i>his own law practice someday.</i>

1538
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:24,538
<i>But he never imagined</i>

1539
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,206
<i>that day would come so soon.</i>

1540
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,543
<i>Or that his practice</i>
<i>would be in Shanghai.</i>

1541
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:32,879
<i>This was not the ending</i>

1542
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,215
<i>I anticipated</i>
<i>when I first met Sam.</i>

1543
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,150
<i>Here was an ambitious man</i>

1544
01:32:37,152 --> 01:32:39,986
<i>who would do anything</i>
<i>for his career.</i>

1545
01:32:39,988 --> 01:32:43,189
<i>But when offered the job</i>
<i>he wanted all along,</i>

1546
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:46,593
<i>he chose instead</i>
<i>to do the right thing.</i>

1547
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:50,997
<i>Perhaps I shouldn't be</i>
<i>so surprised.</i>

1548
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:55,035
<i>Shanghai is a city</i>
<i>that is always changing.</i>

1549
01:32:55,037 --> 01:32:57,070
<i>Why should the people</i>
<i>who come to Shanghai</i>

1550
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:58,838
<i>be any different?</i>

1551
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,913
<i>You may learn to become</i>
<i>a far more humble person.</i>

1552
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:18,792
<i>Become the person</i>
<i>you always dreamed of being.</i>

1553
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:30,303
<i>Realize you've been chasing</i>
<i>the wrong dream</i>

1554
01:33:30,305 --> 01:33:32,205
<i>for far too long.</i>

1555
01:33:32,207 --> 01:33:33,840
Nice car.

1556
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,080
Whoa.

1557
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,623
<i>Or you may find</i>

1558
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:52,158
<i>that the trip</i>
<i>you never wanted to take</i>

1559
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,995
<i>has become the most</i>
<i>rewarding journey of all.</i>

1560
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:03,169
Do you mind keeping an eye on her

1561
01:34:03,171 --> 01:34:05,839
while I get your cake ready?

1562
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:07,307
Happy 30th birthday.

1563
01:34:13,748 --> 01:34:16,016
Still digging that hole to America, huh?

1564
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:19,619
How do you say shovel again?

1565
01:34:19,621 --> 01:34:20,820
Chanzi.

1566
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:24,190
Chanzi.

1567
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,293
<i>This was the story</i>

1568
01:34:27,295 --> 01:34:29,295
<i>of an American named Sam.</i>

1569
01:34:29,297 --> 01:34:34,768
<i>A good man, who was loved by</i>
<i>everyone he met in Shanghai.</i>

1570
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:37,103
<i>For real this time.</i>

1571
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,142
Take one.

1572
01:36:22,144 --> 01:36:25,945
I am totally out of my element here.

1573
01:36:27,716 --> 01:36:29,282
That guy is too.

1574
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:30,483
It doesn't matter how angry she was,

1575
01:36:30,485 --> 01:36:32,418
the fact that she's calling you now,

1576
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,920
means she cares about you.
Sorry.

1577
01:36:33,922 --> 01:36:36,156
Sorry to give you that serious face.

1578
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:39,058
No. I said "angwy."

1579
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:40,760
You've been in China too long.

1580
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,465
Sorry. One more time.

1581
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,203
Cut. Cut.

1582
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:52,205
Ever since relocating to Shanghai,

1583
01:36:52,207 --> 01:36:54,140
I've really fallen in love with chinese culture.

1584
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:55,875
I know what you mean.

1585
01:36:55,877 --> 01:36:57,777
Let's do that again.

1586
01:36:57,779 --> 01:36:59,012
He wants to come with.

1587
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:00,280
Great, great.
The more the merrier.

1588
01:37:00,282 --> 01:37:01,915
Uh, you or, you...

1589
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:03,249
We gotta go.

1590
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:08,021
Take one.

1591
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:12,425
Take two.

1592
01:37:12,427 --> 01:37:15,895
I do not need romance.
I was doing just fine.

1593
01:37:15,897 --> 01:37:17,330
Ow!

1594
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:20,166
Take three.

1595
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:23,803
I was doing just fi...

1596
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:31,211
No. No.

1597
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:36,783
Would you stop doing that?

1598
01:37:36,785 --> 01:37:37,951
Take two.

1599
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:39,285
- Hey, Daniel?
- Yo.

1600
01:37:39,287 --> 01:37:40,453
Just grab her head.

1601
01:37:40,455 --> 01:37:43,456
Yeah. That's sure
gonna get it.

1602
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:45,959
Clam it up, Daniel.

1603
01:37:45,961 --> 01:37:47,293
The reason, the reason,
that I wanted--

1604
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:49,796
the what?

1605
01:37:49,798 --> 01:37:50,997
- Take two.
- Hi.

1606
01:37:50,999 --> 01:37:53,633
The rea--

1607
01:37:59,807 --> 01:38:01,808
Excuse me.

1608
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:04,110
Do you want to cut again?

1609
01:38:04,112 --> 01:38:06,546
I'm so sorry.
It's so embarrassing.

1610
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:07,881
Ah!

1611
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:12,986
Damn! That is a delicious baozi.

1612
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:17,023
Can we do this again?

1613
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:28,268
I'll take this side.
You take this side.

1614
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:29,569
Ok.

1615
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:33,840
Sir, sir, can I get some...

1616
01:38:33,842 --> 01:38:36,075
We have been looking at this menu for hours.

1617
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:42,916
You got it, Daniel.
Bend your knees a little bit.
