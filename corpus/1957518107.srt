1
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,379
The United Methodist
Church is one

2
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,481
of the largest Protestant
denominations in the US,

3
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,616
with about 8 million members.

4
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,285
And, like the rest
of the country,

5
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:27,887
it is bitterly divided
over gay marriage.

6
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,357
He is the minister willing to
give it all up for his son,

7
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,659
even if it means
being forced out

8
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,428
of the priesthood of the
United Methodist Church.

9
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,897
Law changes but religion
doesn't have to change.

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,065
Religion has its own rules.

11
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,768
Religion does not have to
recognize same sex marriage.

12
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,839
There are lots of forms of sin,
and this isn't the only form

13
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:49,309
but it's one that we've
been asked to acknowledge

14
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,277
as normative when it's not.

15
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,880
This is our church, too.

16
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,681
Stand your ground.

17
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,783
This is our table.

18
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,485
Charges have been
brought against me

19
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,955
and I will be in a church trial
to determine whether or not

20
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,425
I have violated the
integrity of the church.

21
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,229
This case has demonstrated
how divided we are

22
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,433
and what a challenging position
that we're in as a church.

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,435
When you performed
your son's wedding,

24
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,872
did you think that the
road would end up here?

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,426
This could be entitled,
Lord is coming, Maranatha.

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,229
Actually, I have seen
a picture like that.

27
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,465
Maranatha the Lord is coming,
and then the clouds like that.

28
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:54,641
I did think of becoming a
minister, actually, early on,

29
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,278
but I always thought
that I couldn't just go

30
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,614
to Bible school, just because
I had an interest in this.

31
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:05,552
The way I was raised
and taught was that this

32
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,820
is a calling from God.

33
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,658
I always interpreted that
to be like a booming voice

34
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,394
from heaven and
that didn't occur,

35
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:19,265
so I decided to follow
in my father's footsteps

36
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,768
and become an engineer.

37
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:28,608
After a couple of years,
I wasn't getting anywhere.

38
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,744
I felt like this is
not really my calling.

39
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,813
In fact, the way I described
it to Brigitte at the time

40
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:38,384
was like, every time I sit
in class, it's like darkness.

41
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,687
I experience
darkness and I can't

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,357
see myself doing this
for the rest of my life.

43
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,825
And something very
incredible happened.

44
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,695
I had a dream.

45
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,998
And I dreamt that I was
transported back in time.

46
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:57,670
I saw myself as a senior in high
school saying to my best friend

47
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,740
then, I'm going to
do an apprenticeship

48
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:05,845
but what I would really like
to do is go to Bible school.

49
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,083
And at that moment, it was like
God was standing next to me

50
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,518
and was saying, "Who
do you think put

51
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:16,522
that desire into your heart?"

52
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,560
And it was like, wow.

53
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,061
There's my booming voice.

54
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,795
There's my calling.

55
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:37,510
I was actually not too surprised
but I wasn't too thrilled.

56
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,646
Did you think it was going to
affect your life in a bad way?

57
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,917
Yeah, I had my thoughts.

58
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,985
About what?

59
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,823
About you going back to
school and us having kids.

60
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,363
What do I love about
the Methodist Church?

61
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,898
Well, I'm a cradle Methodist.

62
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,534
Generations before
I was born, there

63
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,103
were Methodists in my background
on both sides of the family.

64
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,440
So it's sort of like my
mother's milk, you know?

65
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,108
The Lord be with you.

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,009
And also with you.

67
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,911
Lift up your hearts.

68
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,050
The United Methodist
Church, for me,

69
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,153
is a place of connectedness
in the community,

70
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,554
the beloved community of God.

71
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:29,829
This denomination is broad
and inclusive in its scope.

72
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,499
It has always occupied
a kind of middle ground

73
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,967
in American culture.

74
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,737
I love my church.

75
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,040
My church has helped
make me who I am.

76
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,576
My church has given
me the privilege

77
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:49,716
to do things no one could have
ever imagined a little country

78
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:54,020
boy from Clinton,
Louisiana ever doing.

79
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,961
United Methodism,
Methodism in general

80
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,497
has always been steeped
in a love of God

81
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,465
and love of neighbor.

82
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,700
It's in our DNA to be loving.

83
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,938
I mean, conservative, centrists,
liberals, you just count.

84
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,906
United Methodists are
among of the most loving,

85
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,075
gracious, caring
people on the planet.

86
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,978
That's why you find
us in soup kitchens.

87
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,748
That's why you find
us working down

88
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,716
on the border with
immigrant children.

89
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,886
That's why you find us
leading all the social efforts

90
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,456
in most communities.

91
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,726
It's just kind of strange
that the same church that

92
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,464
works so hard against injustice
is also doing injustice

93
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,900
with its members.

94
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,815
After I was ordained in the
United Methodist Church,

95
00:06:55,848 --> 00:07:00,086
I got assigned to a church
in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.

96
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,689
I think the bishop thought
this German pastor would

97
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,093
fit perfectly into the heartland
of Pennsylvania Dutch country.

98
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,998
I though I could
just speak my German

99
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,168
and I could understand
the Pennsylvania German,

100
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,069
but I was wrong.

101
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,106
I remember when that
first person walked up

102
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,242
in my church who tried his
Pennsylvania Dutch on me,

103
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,777
he said and
I said Gesundheit.

104
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,990
I was really active
in the church

105
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,792
during my high school
years, in particular.

106
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,663
So I had served on a
couple of the boards,

107
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,665
I was active in the youth group.

108
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,233
I played the drums
in the worship team,

109
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,236
I sang in the choir.

110
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,105
I would even preach on youth
Sundays and things like that.

111
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,543
So not just church, but my
faith was really important.

112
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:02,582
And I had gone one year with
my dad to an annual conference.

113
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,790
I was always interested
in law and in politics.

114
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,925
And he thought this
is, essentially,

115
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,561
a legislative body, so you'll
find it really fascinating

116
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,763
how they vote on legislation.

117
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,999
It just so happened,
in that year,

118
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,902
there was a debate on the
floor about homosexuality.

119
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,239
An LGBT related piece
of legislation came up

120
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,343
and there was really some
tough debate around that.

121
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,912
I'd say 80% of those
who were speaking

122
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,146
were against the issue.

123
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,816
And there was some
pretty harsh language.

124
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,018
I remember feeling
pretty down about myself

125
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,920
because it was during a
time when I was trying

126
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,190
to figure out my sexuality.

127
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:48,361
So, to me, that sent a
message, really, that who I was

128
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,965
was against church teachings.

129
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,268
I had read this was a
phase that a lot of boys

130
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,235
regularly go through.

131
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,371
They grow out of it.

132
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,973
I guess, at the time, I was kind
of just waiting for that phase

133
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,677
to be over, and when
that didn't happen, year

134
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,347
after year, I really
started to pray to God,

135
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,683
just make me normal.

136
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,053
Let this phase and
I'm going through end.

137
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,188
A lot of times, I
would end up just

138
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:21,060
crying myself to sleep because
I was so distraught over it.

139
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,865
I remember kids at school
asking me, is your brother gay?

140
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,768
And I had never
thought about it.

141
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,970
And I just said
I don't think so.

142
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,839
I mean, I guess he could
be, but I don't know.

143
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,208
He was withdrawn, at that time.

144
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,245
He kind of went from school,
straight up to his room

145
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,147
and he didn't really talk.

146
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,949
And before, we always hung out.

147
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,750
And I thought, well, it's
just being a teenager.

148
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,386
He just needs this
time by himself.

149
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,689
I had seen a friend of
mine come out to his family

150
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,390
and his family kicked
him out of the house.

151
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,427
His mother even said to him,
when I look at your face,

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,861
it makes me want to throw up.

153
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,964
It makes me so
sick to my stomach.

154
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,966
And there was always
that fear that what

155
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,934
if my parents have a problem
with it and they kick me out?

156
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:02,935
Where would I go?

157
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,241
I certainly didn't want to
come out and be this freak

158
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:14,146
and bring shame on my family
or on my local church.

159
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,048
I had started
thinking of some ways

160
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,884
that, the easiest way,
the least painful way,

161
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,686
really, to just kill
myself and end it.

162
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,260
I had actually climbed onto the
roof of the parsonage one day,

163
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,696
because it was up
about three and 1/2,

164
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,299
four stories and honestly
thought if I dove off,

165
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,934
I would probably
break my neck and die.

166
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,376
My daughter came home
from school one day,

167
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,013
and she was very
upset and crying.

168
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:51,250
Tim was telling her that
he thought he was gay

169
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,487
and he was considering suicide.

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,891
I felt strongly that the
parents should be notified,

171
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,395
so I told my daughter that
I could go to a public phone

172
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,964
booth and make the
call from there,

173
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,033
so that it couldn't be traced.

174
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:11,337
I was in my office,
it was the year 2000.

175
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,139
I received this phone call.

176
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:17,276
I said my daughter was
friends with his son.

177
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:22,248
He was gay and that he believed
that being gay was wrong

178
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,751
and he was suicidal.

179
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:33,826
And I heard these words and
they instantly transported me

180
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,096
into this surreal place.

181
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,131
It was almost like an
out of body experience.

182
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:44,503
I was like-- I couldn't
think, I couldn't breathe.

183
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,305
I was shocked.

184
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,209
And I remember driving home to
my wife, sharing it with her,

185
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,977
and she had a similar reaction.

186
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,513
Do I really not
know my children?

187
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,448
I would know this.

188
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,817
I would somehow know.

189
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,485
Both of my parents were
sitting in the living

190
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,155
room, very serious
expressions on their faces.

191
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,892
And my dad said, "Tim,
can you sit down,

192
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,394
because we have to talk
to you about something

193
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,395
really important."

194
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,263
I thought somebody had died.

195
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,231
Is it true?

196
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,199
Are you gay?

197
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,902
I had this phone
conversation with this lady.

198
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,904
I must have hesitated
for quite a while,

199
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,407
and I was going over
my options in my head.

200
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,277
I can tell them the truth or
I can laugh it off and lie.

201
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,912
And I had thought,
you know what?

202
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,880
I'm just going to tell them.

203
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,515
We embraced him that night.

204
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,184
And we just, and I remember
there were a lot of tears.

205
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,986
We were all in tears,
all three of us.

206
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,556
And then we said,
you know, please

207
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,426
know that we will always
love you, no matter what.

208
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,864
He had struggled all this time
and I never knew about it.

209
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,299
And he was all alone in this.

210
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,969
It wasn't that I was
gay that had upset him.

211
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,904
It was that I felt
I couldn't share

212
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,072
with them a part of who I was.

213
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,578
I do remember asking him why
he didn't feel comfortable

214
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,947
talking to us.

215
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,017
And what did he say?

216
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,455
I think was more worried
about it coming out in church,

217
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,423
for your sake.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,135
The simple wedding
ceremony in this church

219
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,971
has turned Methodist
against Methodist.

220
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,909
When Jimmy Creech defied church
guidelines by administering

221
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,011
vows to a lesbian couple.

222
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,547
I'd been doing covenant
ceremonies since 1990

223
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,151
and I had done 12 or 15
or more, because I believe

224
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,154
that was a part of my ministry.

225
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,090
Wedding ceremony was on a
Sunday and, on Monday, all hell

226
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,325
broke out of the United
Methodist Church.

227
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,302
I was aware that trials take
place in the United Methodist

228
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:01,473
Church, but I never knew of
one in any kind of detail.

229
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,277
I didn't know anybody who had
ever gone through a trial.

230
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,980
Creech argued the ban
on homosexual unions

231
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,083
was a guideline,
not a church law.

232
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,651
Thus, he should
not be disciplined.

233
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:19,158
Eight persons voting guilty,
five persons voting not guilty.

234
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,628
He was acquitted by
a jury of his peers.

235
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,097
I was extremely excited.

236
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,534
I thought this was going
to be a significant victory

237
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,003
for the whole church.

238
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,538
I thought this was
going to set clergy

239
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,642
free to be pastors to everyone
in their congregation.

240
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,943
Well it didn't
turn out that way.

241
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,685
In April of 1999, I conducted
a wedding for Larry and Jim.

242
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,988
The bishop had charges
filed against me

243
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,223
and a judicial
process was initiated

244
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:57,363
that resulted in a trial that
took place in November of 1999.

245
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,666
What I decided to do was sort
of a non-violent resistance

246
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,302
to the whole process.

247
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,406
I decided that I would
not ask for legal counsel.

248
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,609
I wouldn't enter a plea
one way or another.

249
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,678
All I would do would be to
answer the church council's

250
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,613
questions honestly.

251
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:18,350
Then, at the end, make
a final statement.

252
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:22,988
My hope was that I
could convince the jury

253
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:28,427
to not vote either way,
and say to the church,

254
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,297
this is a corrupt
and invalid process

255
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,198
that we are not going
to be complicit with.

256
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,104
It was not a shock that
the verdict was guilty,

257
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,273
but I was surprised that
it was a unanimous verdict.

258
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,013
At the end of that
trial, I was no longer

259
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,717
ordained clergy in the
United Methodist Church.

260
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,255
What had been given to me
back in 1970, my ordination,

261
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,091
had been withdrawn.

262
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,292
The trial belongs
to everyone here.

263
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,565
This is their witness.

264
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,101
It's their pain
and it's their hope

265
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,070
that change can
take place that's

266
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,605
really going to make it
possible for the future.

267
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,489
When I was first
appointed to Zion of Iona,

268
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:34,293
my second church in Lebanon,
before I even got there,

269
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,096
before I even met
anybody from the church,

270
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,334
there were already rumors flying
around that I had to gay son.

271
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,538
And that was a problem
for some people.

272
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,707
I knew that there were going
to be certain cities I could

273
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,777
go to where I was going
to be more accepted,

274
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,382
and so I really chose Boston.

275
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,318
I met Bobby, actually,
shortly thereafter.

276
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,222
We met, actually, through my ex.

277
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,156
It got serious pretty quickly.

278
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,658
I would say, right
after our freshman year,

279
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,295
he and I had our first
apartment in Cambridge.

280
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,598
Marriage was something we
had talked about for a while.

281
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,801
So it was, for me,
kind of a no brainer.

282
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,836
I was actually the one
who proposed to him.

283
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,739
Tim just surprised me
one day and he actually

284
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,275
had something else planned, but
he had the ring in his pocket

285
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,076
and couldn't wait any longer.

286
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,478
So he just kind
of blurted it out

287
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,413
while we were in his dorm room.

288
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,119
We had talked about the
option of just going

289
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,155
to a justice of the
peace, but for me, it

290
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,559
was important to have that
religious aspect to it.

291
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:45,397
I remember calling my dad
and saying Dad, I'm engaged.

292
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,733
We've been talking about
it a lot and both Bobby

293
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,636
and I would really like to
have you perform the ceremony.

294
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,604
There wasn't even a hesitation.

295
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,407
I said, absolutely, son.

296
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,745
And I remember just feeling
very joyful and honored

297
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,579
that he would ask me.

298
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:11,790
When two people love each other
so much, like Tim and Bobby do,

299
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,394
whoever says that
such love cannot be?

300
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,197
Tim and Bobby, are you ready?

301
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,934
This is the point of no return.

302
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,203
I, Tim, take you, Bobby--

303
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,571
I, Tim, take you Bobby--

304
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,306
To be my wedded partner.

305
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,208
To be my wedded partner.

306
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,275
Tim, I give you this ring.

307
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,777
Tim, I give you this ring.

308
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,911
As a sign of my vow.

309
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,313
As a sign of my vow.

310
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:35,481
In the name of the Father--

311
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,582
In the name of the Father--

312
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,850
And of the Son.

313
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:38,417
And of the Son.

314
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,418
And of the Holy Spirit.

315
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,686
And of the Holy Spirit.

316
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,521
Amen.

317
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,457
It's a very special
privilege and honor

318
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,293
to announce Tim
and Bobby, married

319
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,661
for the very first time.

320
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,309
It was truly a family
affair and family event.

321
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,310
It was beautiful.

322
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,949
He has made Tim so happy and
I can't imagine one of them

323
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
without the other.

324
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:17,189
I wish Tim and Bobby a
wonderful, fabulous, long
life together

325
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,731
Of course I knew that United
Methodist Church did not

326
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,834
allow ministers to
perform gay marriages.

327
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,770
Ministers had been
defrocked over this.

328
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:36,408
I decided I will perform
this wedding for my son,

329
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:40,379
even if it meant that
I was fired and lost

330
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,016
my job, my career in the
United Methodist Church.

331
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,298
My dad called me
almost six years

332
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,568
to the date of the marriage.

333
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,002
He said you're not
going to believe it,

334
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,506
but a complaint was filed.

335
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,376
I just was stunned, because
almost six years had gone by

336
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,711
and we hadn't heard anything.

337
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,580
It was so weird that it
was just coming up now.

338
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,687
The complaint was filed
26 days before the statute

339
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,956
of limitations expired.

340
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,526
There's a six year
statute of limitations.

341
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,862
He was trying not to get
caught and, at the 11th hour,

342
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,597
he got caught.

343
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,069
He officiated at
his son's wedding

344
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,572
and it may cost this
local minister his job.

345
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,507
The trial of Reverend
Frank Schaefer

346
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,777
is taking place at a Methodist
retreat in Chester County.

347
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,814
Dozens of people, many from
Lancaster and Lebanon counties,

348
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,718
have come to the trial to
support Frank Schaefer.

349
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,787
It was really cool to
see all the support.

350
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,824
There were signs everywhere
and banners and rainbow stoles

351
00:20:58,857 --> 00:20:59,992
and hundreds of people.

352
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,795
We shall overcome.

353
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:08,066
We're here to say
we stand with Frank.

354
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,736
This was my first trial ever.

355
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,638
I had a pretty good
idea what's happening

356
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,407
in criminal court or
the civil court, even,

357
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,411
but I had no idea what to
expect about this church trial.

358
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,813
Keep in mind, this is a trial
with a bishop for a judge

359
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:25,684
and 13 Methodist
pastors as jurors.

360
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:30,122
The actual trial was set
to be in a gymnasium.

361
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:35,861
The church set it up to look
exactly like Law and Order.

362
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,064
It had a judge at the bench,
it had a defendant's table

363
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,565
and a prosecution table.

364
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,734
It had a witness
stand and a jury box.

365
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,071
And it had the gallery
for the spectators.

366
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,541
What other way could you
set up a church trial?

367
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,476
I wondered if there might
be a way to set it up

368
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,879
so you could actually
have a conversation?

369
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:59,618
If you or I are employed
and my employer tells me,

370
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,454
I'm given a handbook,
and my handbook,

371
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,456
it says I'm not
to do these things

372
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,692
or there are consequences.

373
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,528
Frank's given The
Book of Discipline.

374
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,998
They filed two charges.

375
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:18,637
The first charge was performing
a wedding of a same sex couple.

376
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,872
And the second charge
is in the Discipline

377
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,042
as a chargeable
offense, disobedience

378
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,945
to the order of the Discipline.

379
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,681
Knowing that he was
disobeying the Discipline

380
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,718
is undermining the
covenant of the church

381
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,954
and harmful to
the body of Christ

382
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,789
in the United Methodist Church.

383
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,026
It's kind of a quirk
of the trial system

384
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,729
that we could acknowledge that
Pastor Frank had performed

385
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,865
that wedding and still found
him not guilty of performing

386
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:47,966
that wedding.

387
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,203
We never denied
that Frank did this.

388
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:55,507
I really believe that a
father's love for his son

389
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,609
preempts The Book of Discipline.

390
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,117
The Book of Discipline is a
covenant that binds us together

391
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,018
as United Methodists.

392
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,789
It's a book that contains
our doctrinal standards, that

393
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,025
explain what it is that we
believe as United Methodists.

394
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,796
And then it contains lots of
different rules and regulations

395
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,064
about how the Church
is to function.

396
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,572
United Methodist
Church, probably more

397
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,075
than any other denomination,
has this process

398
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:34,746
of discernment of what is God's
will for the denomination that

399
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,817
is a very democratic process.

400
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,686
General Conference
happens every four years.

401
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,856
It's the international gathering
of United Methodists, where

402
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,160
we vote on the polity doctrine
and direction of the Church

403
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,995
for the next four years.

404
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,063
The Book of Discipline
is the outgrowth

405
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,634
of all these generations
of General Conferences,

406
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,736
writing laws and
making adjustments

407
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,806
and adding and subtracting.

408
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,809
Good morning, bishop,
General Conference visitors

409
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,811
and volunteers.

410
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,079
It's time to turn in our
discussion to an issue

411
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,183
that I know matters for
many here and in our church

412
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,186
and in our world.

413
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:20,525
I was a delegate to the
1972 General Conference.

414
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,297
And during that time is when
the issue of homosexuality

415
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,633
sort of came out.

416
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,037
And we made a statement
somewhat similar to the one

417
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,908
that we have now, saying
that heterosexuals, as well

418
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:41,213
as homosexuals, are
persons of sacred worth

419
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:46,251
and are entitled to their
human and civil rights.

420
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:50,755
But when the entire thing came
to the floor, from the floor

421
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,658
there was an amendment that
basically turned the meaning

422
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,060
of everything on its head.

423
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,029
They proposed inserting,
right in the middle

424
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,267
of that, a statement that said
"the practice of homosexuality

425
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,938
is incompatible with
Christian teaching."

426
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,709
And the people
adopted it and we've

427
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:14,179
been living with that
incompatible with Christian

428
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:19,818
teaching language since 1972.

429
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:24,122
People are being
harmed by the church,

430
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:30,195
by the use of the
incompatibility condemnation

431
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,930
language.

432
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:38,937
I am a lesbian and
a child of God.

433
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,840
I think people,
at that time, had

434
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:46,745
little idea of
what fruit would be

435
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,647
reaped from the seed
that was planted

436
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,215
in that little statement.

437
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:54,286
That's led to a ban on the
ordination and appointing

438
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,157
of clergy, a ban on clergy
performing marriage ceremonies

439
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,294
or unions for same sex couples.

440
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,964
The cumulative weight, if you're
a queer person in the church,

441
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,267
is to see that every four years,
something gets worse for you.

442
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,303
Friends, we're going to
be moving toward a break.

443
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,704
God's love is for everyone!

444
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,905
Let's be in order, please.

445
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,307
God's love is for everyone.

446
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,044
Even if we have to
remind the church.

447
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,379
When they took that
action about clergy

448
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:25,050
could not perform
holy union ceremonies,

449
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,353
I said that one will
come back to haunt us.

450
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,098
The first phase of the trial
was guilt or not guilt.

451
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,068
And each side was only
allowed one witness.

452
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,870
Our witness was Frank.

453
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:50,108
The church's witness
was the complainant.

454
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:55,280
Jon Boger took the
stand and I don't even

455
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,216
know how to describe it.

456
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,286
He was very
emotional, although it

457
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,888
was a little hard
to figure out what

458
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,191
he was being emotional about.

459
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,694
Then he started crying and I'm
like, what is wrong with you?

460
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,062
It was very embarrassing.

461
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,832
So none of us liked
him, from the start.

462
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,034
I mean, you could hear
grumbles behind me.

463
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,036
Just.

464
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:22,240
We were not impressed
by him at all.

465
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:26,344
Jon is in the military and is
accustomed to following orders.

466
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,981
Even orders you might not
agree with or understand,

467
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,117
you're supposed to follow them.

468
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,787
Reverend Schaefer did baptize
at least one of his children

469
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,290
and so Jon had put a
lot of trust in Frank

470
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,760
and he felt like that
trust was violated when

471
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,862
Frank disobeyed the Discipline.

472
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,363
He said that the
Reverend's decision

473
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,334
to officiate the marriage was
both a lie and broken covenant.

474
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,302
I didn't actually
know him that well

475
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:56,508
because, during my 11 years of
ministry at the Iona church,

476
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,110
I had maybe seen him
about once a year.

477
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,013
Because he was in the Navy
and he never lived in Lebanon.

478
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,350
So he was never a
regular attendee.

479
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,118
The only way I knew
Jon was that we

480
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,988
had prayed for him as
part of a youth group,

481
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,923
because he served
in the military.

482
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,826
So I was very confused
as to how this

483
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,428
affected his spiritual life.

484
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,097
But was it knowledge that
there had been multiple staff

485
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,398
issues with his mother?

486
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,168
Absolutely.

487
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,037
He denied that this
was a vendetta.

488
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:30,308
He said it just so happened that
he found out about the wedding

489
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,778
and he was appalled and
decided to file a complaint.

490
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,979
There was no vendetta.

491
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,382
It was just simply
the straw that

492
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:41,486
broke the camel's back was the
marriage certificate that Frank

493
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,322
conducted the same
sex marriage for Tim.

494
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:48,193
And Frank can twist
it anyway he wants to,

495
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,061
but that's the bottom line.

496
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,129
The man that filed
the complaint,

497
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,332
a member of Schaefer's
congregation, said little.

498
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,068
What would you say to the folks
that are watching out here?

499
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:57,969
Sir, I have no comment.

500
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,879
There were other issues
involved besides the wedding.

501
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,150
I felt that it was almost
a minor issue compared

502
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,352
with some of the
other issues that

503
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,155
were going on in the church.

504
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,406
I met Frank when I was
a seminary student.

505
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,244
The church had advertised for
an open position for a youth

506
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,245
pastor.

507
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,479
We hit it off right away.

508
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,617
We had a lot of the same visions
and hope for the community,

509
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,285
for the church to grow.

510
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:51,055
We started a second service and
that was very much necessary

511
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:56,161
because we had grown from about
140 in worship to over 200,

512
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,130
and the room was just too small.

513
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:04,903
The contemporary service had
an incredible rock group.

514
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,638
The traditional service
was equally powerful

515
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,074
but in a quieter way, older
folks, more traditional

516
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:14,279
in their background and
their understanding of faith.

517
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,081
We attracted more
and more people.

518
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,385
We had lesbian
couples and gay men

519
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,554
come and join us
in our ministry.

520
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,323
We attracted people of color.

521
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,525
Everybody was welcome.

522
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,930
We were homeless and that's how
we got affiliated with the Iona

523
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,398
church.

524
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,434
There was just something
about Iona that struck with me

525
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,404
and I stayed there, especially
with Pastor Frank Schaefer.

526
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,674
He was probably the most
genuine person I've ever seen.

527
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,475
We're going to take
the joy of the Lord

528
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,913
and we're going to take that joy
with us into our daily lives.

529
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,515
We're just going to start today.

530
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,451
We do some refreshments,
so please stay a while

531
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,987
and have some fellowship and
some refreshments and see you

532
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,957
all next week, same
time, same place.

533
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,192
People are drawn to that
and that's why we grew.

534
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,498
At one point, the second
service was doing so well,

535
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,401
the attendance started to
exceed the first service.

536
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:14,472
That is when we began
to see some of the pain

537
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,709
and the struggle and the
attacks that this story has.

538
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,581
I started to see
a change in Frank

539
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:28,286
and his message and the
way he conducted himself.

540
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,688
It would appear as
if he didn't prepare

541
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,024
for that traditional service.

542
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:36,194
He was late for services.

543
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,396
It seemed as if
he would have been

544
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,699
content to let the traditional
service pretty much

545
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,235
go by the wayside or die.

546
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,638
It wasn't the second
service saying we

547
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,006
don't like the first service.

548
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,507
We don't fit in.

549
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,343
It was the first
service saying we

550
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,613
don't like all the attention
the second service is getting.

551
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,649
They really wanted
the status quo

552
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,285
of the way the church had been,
for many of them, from the time

553
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,986
that they started
there as an infant.

554
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,691
He self-taught himself
how to play guitar.

555
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:12,430
He kind of pretty much wanted
to be a rock star type guy.

556
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:17,435
I learned about the
concern that some people

557
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,738
had at the Iona church
over me having a gay son.

558
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,645
I stood in the presence of
two people that literally

559
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,747
said what is he doing wrong?

560
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,250
Why can't he fix his kid?

561
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:36,654
And so that mindset translated
to, he doesn't do this right,

562
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,557
he doesn't do that right,
the service started late,

563
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,061
his hair wasn't combed, his wife
doesn't wear dresses enough.

564
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,496
And it just snowballed.

565
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,299
Things were really
starting to pile up

566
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:53,404
and there was some maybe
animosity between Pastor Frank

567
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,441
and the choir director
at our church.

568
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,610
It kind of got through the
church and to the choir

569
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,114
that Frank had
requested her dismissal.

570
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,517
That did not sit well with
a whole group of people.

571
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:09,654
My hypothesis is
that a group forms

572
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:12,156
and they're known as
the concerned group.

573
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,625
We were a concerned group.

574
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,462
The group probably consisted
of about 30 people maybe.

575
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:25,770
They were about how do we get
rid of this man and his family?

576
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:26,738
What can we do?

577
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:34,345
So the very next day, after I
had this talk with the choir

578
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,515
director, the very next
day, I received a phone call

579
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,783
from my DS.

580
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,755
I had been accused by Jon Boger,
the son of the choir director,

581
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:48,459
of having had a sexual affair,
in the church's bathroom,

582
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,697
with a former male staff
member of the church,

583
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,167
and that the janitor of the
church had walked in on us

584
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,137
and seen the whole thing.

585
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,138
Is it true?

586
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,440
Did this happen,
the DS asked me.

587
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,342
I said absolutely not.

588
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,510
Absolutely not.

589
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,844
Why don't you call the janitor?

590
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,846
I have her number right
here in my cell phone.

591
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,349
I said I don't know what
you're talking about.

592
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,719
I didn't find Frank or
anybody doing anything.

593
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,122
The previous allegation that
I investigated about Frank

594
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,859
turned out to be totally
specious and without merit.

595
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,295
But once a rumor
starts, there's always

596
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,431
lots of rumors that
stay out there.

597
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,699
And it's in the
community then, too.

598
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,837
There was an attempt to try
and uncover those things.

599
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,475
But, in defense of, Frank,
it was never substantiated.

600
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,310
Nothing was ever proven
one way or the other.

601
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:51,456
About three weeks after
the initial accusation,

602
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,659
there was a complaint
filed against me.

603
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:59,597
The complaint was about having
performed Tim's same sex wedding

604
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,702
One of the members of
the church at the time,

605
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:09,207
and it's no secret, Jon
Boger, researched it

606
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,944
and we found proof through
the marriage certificate.

607
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:17,248
This had nothing to do with
homosexuality or homosexuality

608
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,586
bashing, as the
LGBT would see it

609
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,921
or as Frank or other
people at the church

610
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,690
would see it at the time.

611
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:35,299
It was about what was right
with Frank, Frank presiding

612
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,668
over Tim's same sex marriage.

613
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,203
It was illegal.

614
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,471
He couldn't do it.

615
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,746
Hi, I'm Rob Renfroe,
President of Good News

616
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,782
and this is Tom Lambrecht,
our vice president

617
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,484
and general manager.

618
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,486
Well, Good News'
mission and purpose

619
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,256
is really to help the
church to maintain fidelity

620
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,358
to scriptural Christianity.

621
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,959
We try to keep the
church centered

622
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:07,532
on Christ and faithful to what
God has revealed in the Bible.

623
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,900
I think it's very
important that we

624
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,669
maintain the content
of Christianity

625
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:16,274
and not change or adapt
the content to fit whatever

626
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:20,912
whims of culture and intellect
happen to be at the moment.

627
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,847
I'm speaking to
you today because I

628
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,617
am concerned about our
United Methodist Church.

629
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,520
More and more United
Methodist pastors

630
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,957
have begun to perform
same sex services.

631
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,928
One bishop said that she thinks
we want a gay free church,

632
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,864
and nothing could be
farther from the truth.

633
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:44,335
What we want is the church to
be open to all people, no matter

634
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,306
our sin, no matter our desires.

635
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:53,511
You are a person of sacred
worth, but what you do is sin.

636
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,447
You know, love the
sinner, hate the sin?

637
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,383
That's a kind of craziness
that asks a person

638
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,786
to live a dichotomous life.

639
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:02,887
You are who you are.

640
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,356
You are who God
created you to be.

641
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,993
So to say that it's
OK that I'm gay,

642
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,028
that I want to have
sex with another woman,

643
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,598
but it's not OK that I
actually have sex with her,

644
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:14,966
that makes no sense.

645
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,469
And, even if it did, it
would be cruel to say

646
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,638
that this portion
of the population

647
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:25,509
should be deprived of the
basic human need for love

648
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,978
and intimacy.

649
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:31,582
Our church has been taken
over by the religious right

650
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:37,088
and politicized the church
to where we are now.

651
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:40,358
This is a matter of
power and control.

652
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,761
It is to maintain the
status quo and it's

653
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:48,332
to deny the freedoms of a
particular group of persons.

654
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,437
It became clear to some
of us that the only way

655
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:56,440
change was going to happen
was from the bottom up.

656
00:37:56,474 --> 00:38:00,544
And so we borrowed a model
from the Presbyterians

657
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:03,648
and decided that we would begin
a network of United Methodist

658
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,750
congregations which
would publicly

659
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,119
declare that they welcomed
all persons, regardless

660
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,320
of sexual orientation.

661
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,726
We have a large body of people
in the United Methodist Church

662
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,863
who are committed together
for full inclusion.

663
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,065
And they're sending a
message to the denomination

664
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:23,067
by saying we're reconciling.

665
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,635
In that statement,
they're saying

666
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,771
we disagree with
the formal policies,

667
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,706
we disagree with
current practices that

668
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,908
maintain a stance
of exclusivity,

669
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,811
and we are working for change.

670
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:40,084
Are we really two churches,
pretending to be one or are we

671
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:44,955
one church that just simply
cannot find a way to live

672
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,557
together?

673
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,026
I wish we never had to
talk about this again.

674
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,964
And if the other side would
not make this their agenda,

675
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,735
if this is not what they pushed
over and over and over again,

676
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,905
you wouldn't hear
anything from us.

677
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:04,809
If you go to McDonald's
and buy a hamburger,

678
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,043
you know that, no
matter whether you're

679
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:10,848
going to one in Alabama or Maine
or California or Wisconsin,

680
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,551
you're going to get the
same hamburger everywhere.

681
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,020
If you go into a United
Methodist Church,

682
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:19,056
you don't know what you're going
to get, in terms of theology.

683
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,970
So taking the witness stand,
I wasn't actually sure

684
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,639
how much I was
allowed to get in.

685
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,041
My counsels had a great idea.

686
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:41,045
They said why don't we
start with introducing you

687
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,683
to the jurors, because
the jurors didn't know me.

688
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,786
Who is this person you're
accusing and are considering

689
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,489
whether he can continue to be
a United Methodist minister

690
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,123
or not?

691
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:59,497
And I started to tell the story
from the beginning and a very

692
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,165
curious thing happened.

693
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:07,538
I kept telling more and more
about the story of my son, Tim.

694
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,178
Tim was very sick
when he was born.

695
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,247
He had a heart lung problem.

696
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,717
They duct just didn't close.

697
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,752
I remember the
doctor telling us,

698
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,954
he's not going to live
through the night.

699
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,757
And I mean, that
was devastating.

700
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,027
Our faith played a really
important role at that time.

701
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,597
And I remember the whole
church was praying for Tim.

702
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,599
He survived the night
and then we just

703
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,169
visited every single day.

704
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:42,039
And the only way we could touch
him was through the incubator.

705
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,775
He had an operation
and it was successful.

706
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,877
And then we could take him
home for the very first time

707
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,245
a few days after that.

708
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:48,913
And that was amazing.

709
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,190
When your little kid's like
that, you bond even tighter.

710
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:05,930
And he was Frank's little
miracle, his whole life.

711
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,532
And so, when he was struggling
with this, of course

712
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,835
they're going to gather
around him and say it's OK.

713
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:20,644
I even quoted scripture.

714
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,614
I brought in the parable
of the Good Samaritan

715
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,115
and actually got in a defense.

716
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:32,690
He admits that he did
it, but he doesn't

717
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,660
admit that he's guilty
for anything by doing it.

718
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,795
He's not guilty.

719
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,302
And I told the jury
that I could not

720
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:50,140
ignore my son, who was like this
man in the parable of the Good

721
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,043
Samaritan, who was beaten up
and bleeding in the street.

722
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,746
And I couldn't pass
by on the other side,

723
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,315
like the Levite
and the priest did.

724
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,817
I had to help my son.

725
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,753
He was hurt by the
doctrine of the Church,

726
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,355
and he asked me for help.

727
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,056
And I couldn't refuse him.

728
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,725
It was an act of love.

729
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,668
I felt, for the first time
in the trial, a real sense

730
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,670
of lightness in the courtroom.

731
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,707
It just seemed to be this
acknowledgement and an embrace

732
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:28,279
of a father's love for his son.

733
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,648
I don't agree with The
Book of Discipline.

734
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,617
But, at the same
time, I'll uphold it.

735
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:38,923
But it was his son.

736
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,826
And while I say I'll uphold
it, my kids are four and two,

737
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,297
but what if, by the time my
children are marrying age,

738
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,999
my daughter comes to me
and says, "I'm a lesbian

739
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,135
and I want you to
officiate at my wedding?"

740
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:51,802
What am I going to do?

741
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:08,052
Growing up in a
rather conservative

742
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,056
evangelical environment,
in my family, in my church,

743
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:16,126
I definitely remember
thinking that homosexuality

744
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,161
was a sin at that point.

745
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,946
Hey, willkommen.

746
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,414
Come on in.

747
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,718
This is actually the apartment
that we used to live in

748
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,087
in Germany, in Wuppertal.

749
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,854
Dining table here.

750
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,289
Dining table.

751
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,457
And a sofa was over there.

752
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,826
And the sofa was
over here, right.

753
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,195
But the palm tree did really
well because of the light here.

754
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,197
So it was a huge palm tree.

755
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,866
And remember, one Christmas,
we decorated that?

756
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,935
Decorated the palm tree and
your mother thought, what?

757
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,803
You don't have a Christmas tree?

758
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,406
Said that's our Christmas tree.

759
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:03,340
She wasn't convinced.

760
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,143
She didn't like it.

761
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,312
This entire apartment
building is actually

762
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:13,183
owned by my mother-in-law and,
at the time, my father-in-law.

763
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,252
There's just a lot of
diversity in this building.

764
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,056
People from other
countries and among them

765
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,759
were several gay couples.

766
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,395
They were friends with
one particular guy

767
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,096
who was super nice.

768
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,932
That was the first time I
ever talked to a gay person.

769
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:32,403
And I have to say,
he was really nice.

770
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:35,105
And I was really
intrigued by that,

771
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:39,476
because I had been taught
that gay people are different

772
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,146
and it's sinful and
they're going to hell

773
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,447
and all these things I'd heard.

774
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,416
And then so I met
this guy, I was

775
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,887
surprised by how nice
he was and how close I

776
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,389
felt to this person,
just talking to him.

777
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,759
It was like we had a connection
and it really changed my life.

778
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:06,837
OK, in preparation to go up the
highest mountain in Germany,

779
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,372
you've got to put on
some extra clothes.

780
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,324
I thought that because being
gay was so statistically rare,

781
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,861
my brother had used up all
of the gay in our family.

782
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,963
It would be so unlikely
for two of us to be gay.

783
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,235
First, I thought,
well, I'm bisexual.

784
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:41,905
I like guys too, but I
just also like women.

785
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,241
I told Kevin first.

786
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,543
He thought I was
joking around with him.

787
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,979
I had already arrived at the
conclusion that I was gay

788
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,215
but I was holding out
on telling anyone,

789
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,383
just to be extra sure
before I came out.

790
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:58,122
We made this agreement to come
out to our parents together,

791
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,258
but then I ended up
just telling them.

792
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:03,427
She said I think I might
think I might be bisexual.

793
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,561
And we said, OK.

794
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,930
Well, I guess you have to
find that out for yourself

795
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:11,502
and whatever you
are, we love you.

796
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,238
I think, in the back of my mind,
I knew I was gay all along,

797
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,107
but I just didn't want to
let go of the idea of getting

798
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,109
married to a man,
having a family,

799
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:21,612
living the, quote,
unquote, normal life.

800
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:24,281
And I realized that that
was never going to happen,

801
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:28,218
that I was only
attracted to women.

802
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,187
I don't even remember
my coming out very well.

803
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,990
It was such an
insignificant moment.

804
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,492
It wasn't a big deal
because we really, frankly,

805
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,327
we knew about it.

806
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:40,297
He was different from
other kids in the same way,

807
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,266
really, that I was
different from other kids.

808
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,067
We wouldn't play the same.

809
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,335
We would play more
with the girls,

810
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,970
rather than with the boys.

811
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,906
They didn't have to say
like, we love you.

812
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,474
We still love you or
anything like that.

813
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,442
It felt like a
non-issue and I think

814
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,346
that was probably the best
thing that could have happened.

815
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,583
I was wondering, are
all our kids gay?

816
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,450
Yeah.

817
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,886
That had began to--

818
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,356
We had to ask Pascal.

819
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,527
Yeah, for a while we kind
of wondered about Pascal.

820
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,565
I kind of just hinted to them
for a while, I'm not gay.

821
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:17,534
He thought we, as
the gay siblings,

822
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:22,105
would be upset if
he were not gay.

823
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,074
Yeah, there was some
pressure, right,

824
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,577
because you have to follow the
precedents of your siblings.

825
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,946
So, yeah, I guess there
was kind of a coming

826
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,316
out of me being straight.

827
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,364
Continuing coverage now of
Reverend Frank Schaefer's trial

828
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,066
in the United Methodist Church.

829
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,201
Tonight, we have the verdict.

830
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,137
Because I felt I
had been able to put

831
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,273
in a pretty good
defense on my behalf,

832
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,976
I felt optimistic
about the verdict.

833
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,143
Because I really
believed I could

834
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,013
be acquitted at this point.

835
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,283
We had heard word that the
jury had reached a verdict.

836
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,987
We reconvened in the
gymnasium, the courtroom.

837
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,658
As the jurors were walking
in, I looked over to them

838
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:18,495
and I noticed that they were
all avoiding eye contact with me

839
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:21,465
and I knew that
wasn't good news.

840
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,268
Reverend Frank Schaefer
will learn his exact penalty

841
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,235
tomorrow.

842
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,504
Tonight, he learned
that he was convicted

843
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,573
of breaking the rules of
the United Methodist Church.

844
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,379
And I was devastated.

845
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:41,418
I thought I had prepared
myself for a guilty verdict,

846
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,420
but there's no way that
you can prepare yourself

847
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:44,688
for something like that.

848
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:49,359
I wasn't emotionally prepared
for hearing those words spoken

849
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:54,164
by a representative of the
entire church, telling me

850
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:58,068
I had violated the
order and the Discipline

851
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,136
of the entire church.

852
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:09,680
It felt horrible to
be in that space.

853
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,764
Trials are not something that
we look forward to or want

854
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,368
to have, but it is
the last resort way

855
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,237
that we have of holding people
accountable to the promises

856
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,773
that they made when
they became pastors.

857
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,444
When we have a church trial,
because somebody dared

858
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:44,581
to minister to a gay person
or because, God forbid,

859
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:50,787
somebody is gay, and we
put them on trial for that,

860
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:57,160
it brings to the surface the
ugliness that lies beneath.

861
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:08,105
I loved being a minister.

862
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,641
Every day was packed with
work that was very meaningful.

863
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,177
But I felt more
and more isolated,

864
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:18,648
being an ordained minister
but being in the closet.

865
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:25,188
I was sad and frustrated
and unhappy, personally.

866
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:28,558
She was our associate
pastor and was much loved

867
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:33,363
and was just a wonderful pastor.

868
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:37,167
I started to think coming out
is something I need to do,

869
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,503
and I need to do it here
because this is a church that's

870
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,638
already inclusive.

871
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,674
This is a church where my coming
out will not divide or upset

872
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,376
the congregation.

873
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:51,548
So I decided to come
out on April 27, 2003.

874
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:55,118
I know that by telling
the truth about myself,

875
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:59,389
I risk losing my credentials
as an ordained United Methodist

876
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,825
minister.

877
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,861
But I have realized that
not telling the whole truth

878
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:11,168
about myself has been
holding me back in my faith.

879
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,871
Here I am, for this Sunday
at least, and perhaps

880
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,708
for many months to
come, your openly

881
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,378
lesbian, fully credentialed
United Methodist pastor.

882
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,226
Nobody wanted to have a trial.

883
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,430
It was much more a matter
of Bishop Weaver believing

884
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,232
that, in his role
as a bishop, he

885
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:47,671
had an obligation to uphold
church law as currently written

886
00:51:55,479 --> 00:52:00,417
The presiding Bishop, the
judge, said this trial is not

887
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,818
about The Book of Discipline.

888
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,554
This trial is not
about the Bible.

889
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,656
The only thing that
we're determining

890
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:11,194
is whether Beth Stroud did
violate paragraph whatever

891
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:13,330
of The Book of Discipline.

892
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,699
The verdict hinged
on the question

893
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:22,839
of whether I was a self-avowed
practicing homosexual.

894
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:27,544
It hinged on some very
painful and embarrassing

895
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:32,249
personal questions I was
asked in the courtroom

896
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:33,283
that I don't care to repeat.

897
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,824
The report of the trial
court is that the credentials

898
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,425
of the respondent
are to be withdrawn.

899
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,797
The vote was seven to six,
meeting the required vote

900
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,665
for the penalty.

901
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,010
There weren't really a lot
of other opportunities for me

902
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,680
after that, in the
United Methodist Church.

903
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,599
Our top story, a
Lebanon County pastor

904
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,868
convicted of
violating church law

905
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,471
could learn his
punishment today.

906
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:35,345
I was in a different mindset on
day two than I was on day one.

907
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:39,382
I have to admit, I was angry.

908
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:42,586
I was angry at the
church for ignoring

909
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:46,656
the good ministry I had
provided for more than 20 years.

910
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,026
And when I walked
into that courtroom,

911
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,029
I was not as intimidated
as I felt the first day.

912
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,931
It's been a full
day of testimony

913
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,501
from witnesses in the
sentencing phase of this trial.

914
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:01,972
We wanted to present
to the trial court

915
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:06,376
the impact of Frank's actions,
the impact on the church.

916
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,712
Former congregation members
testified about a split

917
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,913
in the church.

918
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,083
Honestly, to not defrock him
sends a message that I think

919
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,318
would be hurtful
in the long run.

920
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,989
William Bailey testified,
quote, "The impact on my family

921
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,590
was devastating.

922
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,326
The impact on the
congregation was devastating.

923
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,729
People left, and left
with their wallets."

924
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,731
A lot of the
testimony was dated.

925
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,466
It wasn't even accurate.

926
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,369
We were suffering financially
when the recession happened.

927
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,772
We were suffering financially
when we began to have attacks.

928
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,009
Some good people left
because of these bullies.

929
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:43,079
I do think that there
were some crocodile tears.

930
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,881
People weren't sworn in.

931
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,650
Maybe if they were
sworn in, they

932
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,718
wouldn't be saying these things.

933
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:52,555
Well, I felt the way things
were handled was way out of line

934
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,557
and over the top.

935
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:58,028
But my worry was Tim.

936
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,863
Schaefer's son Tim
is here and will

937
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,898
testify in his father's behalf.

938
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,701
They put you in a
little waiting room,

939
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,570
and the waiting room essentially
was a custodial closet.

940
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,939
I just remember
thinking, how ironic

941
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,075
is it that I'm being
put into a closet

942
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,411
by representatives
of the church,

943
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,914
in preparation for testifying.

944
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,850
It was very difficult to
listen to Tim's testimony,

945
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,787
because he was really sick
about this whole thing.

946
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,388
But he did so well.

947
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:28,458
I was so proud of him
for sharing his story

948
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,761
in front of a hostile court.

949
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:35,832
And yet he told it with
so much passion and grace.

950
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,568
There was one question
in cross examination.

951
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,737
And the question was
really a clever way

952
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,708
to bring in my divorce.

953
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,176
Bobby and I were going
through a divorce

954
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,544
and it hadn't been
finalized yet.

955
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,584
We did keep the fact that we
were separated from the media.

956
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,653
We thought that,
if people found out

957
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,987
that we were going
through a divorce,

958
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,091
it would change the trial.

959
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:05,628
The question was not asked to
shame Frank or Tim in any way.

960
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,598
The question was asked
to point out the fact

961
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:12,068
that, if there was a divorce,
there could be another marriage

962
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,137
and that Frank might
feel like he needed

963
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,972
to perform another wedding.

964
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,875
The first line of
defense, on either side,

965
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:22,178
is to question the
integrity of your witness.

966
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,448
This was a private affair
that was nobody's business.

967
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:28,618
I mean, it's one thing if
they want to talk to me

968
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:33,456
and reprimand me, but to
pull in my whole family

969
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:39,062
into this, and in front of the
whole world, that's an affront.

970
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:56,713
During the lunch break,
I sensed that I could not

971
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:01,618
go through with the
testimony that I had

972
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,219
coordinated with my counsels.

973
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,954
I was supposed to evade.

974
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:08,124
I was supposed to make
blanket statements.

975
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,260
I was opposed to redirect.

976
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,263
I wasn't able to say all
that because it wasn't what

977
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,864
I felt in my heart.

978
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,933
What I felt in my
heart was I needed

979
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,937
to let them know where I stood.

980
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:25,508
So I went into my
room and I prayed.

981
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:29,746
I remember saying to God,
can I take the stand?

982
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,648
What will I do if
I get defrocked?

983
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,016
What about my career?

984
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,118
What about my paycheck?

985
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,019
What about my family?

986
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,954
What about health insurance?

987
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,256
And it was in that
moment when it

988
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,661
was like God was saying consider
what I have done for you.

989
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:48,998
Jesus gave up
everything, not just

990
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:51,935
his career and his paycheck.

991
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,971
He gave up everything.

992
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:57,273
And all of the sudden,
I knew what I had to do.

993
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,617
And I got really nervous
and I remember actually

994
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,819
feeling sick to my stomach.

995
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,656
I just wasn't sure whether
the words would come out.

996
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,258
And I had no script.

997
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:19,062
And I sat in the stand and
I remember looking over

998
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,764
to my family and,
behind my family,

999
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:27,337
I saw all these people in
rainbow colored stoles.

1000
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:33,243
And I remember thinking, wow,
there are a lot of supporters

1001
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,111
here in this room,
and somehow, I

1002
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:39,148
felt strength coming back into
me and my confidence came back.

1003
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,919
And I heard myself say words
that were just incredible.

1004
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,120
These were words that
were given to me.

1005
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,158
I want you to know
that, if I'm going

1006
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,329
to be United Methodist
minister tomorrow,

1007
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,934
I will not discriminate
against anybody based

1008
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,769
on their sexual orientation.

1009
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:02,939
I will not refuse
ministry to them.

1010
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,242
We are treating our LGBT
brothers and sisters

1011
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,711
as second class Christians.

1012
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,713
The hate speech has to stop.

1013
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:15,752
We are harming beloved
children of God.

1014
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,587
And then I remember
taking out this stole.

1015
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,928
And I said to the
trial court, you know,

1016
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:30,300
I don't think things
happen by accident.

1017
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,834
I was given this
stole yesterday.

1018
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:41,377
I'm wearing the stole as a
visible sign of my commitment

1019
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,949
to be an advocate for
the LGBT community.

1020
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,951
And that I can no
longer be silent,

1021
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,653
but that I have to speak.

1022
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,988
And that is all I have to say.

1023
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,264
It was really emotional.

1024
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,766
I heard some gasps behind me.

1025
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,135
I was more proud
of my dad than ever

1026
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,439
before when he pulled
that out and put it on.

1027
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:14,978
It was almost, for me,
a relief and, really,

1028
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,413
like a burden off me.

1029
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,818
Counsel for the church had their
moment of cross examination.

1030
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:25,388
I could tell that he
thought that's it.

1031
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,256
He just made my case.

1032
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,993
Frank, you have been found
guilty by this court.

1033
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,861
Do you repent?

1034
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,963
No, I cannot.

1035
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:37,166
Will you from, this
day onward, promise

1036
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,769
to uphold the
Discipline and never

1037
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,971
perform a gay marriage again?

1038
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:45,375
I cannot make that statement.

1039
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,777
And that was the end.

1040
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:54,951
And it was like a huge load had
been lifted from my shoulders.

1041
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,088
And I was free.

1042
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:01,124
I didn't care, at this
moment, whether they

1043
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,158
were going to defrock me.

1044
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:06,162
In fact, I would have rejoiced.

1045
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:09,799
I felt like I had done
what God had sent me to do.

1046
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:19,842
And then Jon Boger
came back to the stand

1047
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:25,181
and said something like, did
you just hear what he just said?

1048
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,118
Did anybody in this room
hear what this man just said?

1049
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,054
And I found myself smiling.

1050
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,396
All around the deliberating
room, every single one

1051
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,966
said if he hadn't
made that speech,

1052
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,470
they would've been
more merciful.

1053
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,506
Well, the penalty phase
wrapped up tonight, Janelle,

1054
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,810
and the jury came back with
a very interesting decision,

1055
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:57,213
suspending Pastor Frank
Schaefer for 30 days.

1056
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:00,416
He has 30 days to
consider whether he

1057
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:06,089
will remain in the
United Methodist Church

1058
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:09,025
and agree to uphold
the entire Discipline.

1059
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:13,162
My first thought was wait, so
they're putting this on me?

1060
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,298
We didn't want to become
part of the story.

1061
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,567
We just wanted our decision
to be our decision.

1062
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,802
We didn't want to be
part of turning Pastor

1063
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:24,240
Frank into a martyr or a hero.

1064
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,976
So they loaded the weapon, they
put a round in the chamber,

1065
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,511
and they said you
have 30 days to decide

1066
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:29,846
to kill your whole career.

1067
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,147
And then we'll get back to you.

1068
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,117
And, by the way, don't
perform any gay weddings

1069
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,452
over the next 30 days.

1070
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,054
It was brilliant.

1071
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:38,955
He gets to choose.

1072
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:41,023
It'll be his
responsibility whether he

1073
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,593
can live within the covenant.

1074
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:47,964
I remember other jury members
being happy and feeling

1075
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,500
like a weight had been lifted
off their shoulder because they

1076
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:55,104
felt that the burden of the
verdict wasn't on them anymore.

1077
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:56,472
It was on Frank.

1078
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,374
But I knew.

1079
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:03,012
I knew from what he said that
we were forcing him to hand

1080
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,448
in his ordination credentials.

1081
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,382
And so it was us.

1082
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:07,250
It wasn't him.

1083
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,322
Supporters immediately
flipped over their chairs

1084
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,858
and started singing in
support of the Schaefer

1085
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:19,328
family following Tuesday
night's penalty hearing.

1086
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,570
I just, I was like in a daze.

1087
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,506
I was like in a dream.

1088
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,943
And then, next thing
I knew, I was grabbed.

1089
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,045
Frank, you need to do communion.

1090
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,915
You need to give us communion.

1091
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:42,051
This is the cup,
the cup that Jesus

1092
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:45,354
raised at the end of
the Passover meal.

1093
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:49,392
This is a new
covenant, a new time,

1094
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:53,930
when everybody could come
to him, to his table.

1095
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:58,501
And everybody could receive
grace and unconditional

1096
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,037
love because of his sacrifice.

1097
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,138
Thank you, pastor.

1098
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:10,146
We decided we were going
to take this church camp

1099
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,249
and reclaim it for
Christian purposes.

1100
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,292
So it's up to me.

1101
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,461
I have 30 days.

1102
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:30,566
I'm here to tell you of that
I will not change my mind.

1103
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,703
What I said tonight is the
truth and the full truth,

1104
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,539
and so we'll see how
the church is going

1105
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,574
to deal with it in 30 days.

1106
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:19,348
It's hard to sort of
watch the whole world

1107
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:24,186
advance around LGBTQ inclusion
and, as a church, not go along

1108
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,254
with it on some level.

1109
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,293
General Conference
meets every four years

1110
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,596
and, every four years,
we try earnestly, we

1111
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:37,133
bring these petitions and we
say, please change these rules,

1112
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,201
please listen to
our story, please

1113
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,071
affirm our basic
humanity and the fact

1114
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,640
that God didn't make a
mistake by making us gay.

1115
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,076
And they say no.

1116
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:51,080
What happens is,
from our side, we go

1117
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,615
and we think we know
that we're going

1118
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,517
to win these and the
first one comes up

1119
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,018
and everybody's on
pins and needles

1120
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:56,786
and holding your breath.

1121
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:57,787
And then our side wins.

1122
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,256
It's thank God.

1123
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:03,159
And then you see the
other side's hurting,

1124
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:06,796
and they do some kind of
demonstration or whatever.

1125
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:10,166
And the way that it works is
that this issue comes up three

1126
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,635
or four other places and
gets voted on three or four

1127
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,170
other times.

1128
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:17,506
And now, you know,
it's like hey Tom, bam,

1129
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,708
we got a guy last time.

1130
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,309
Hold him up again.

1131
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,777
We're going to get a
chance to hit him again.

1132
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,245
Boom.

1133
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,347
This is going to come
up two more times.

1134
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,314
Hold him up.

1135
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,248
Boom, boom.

1136
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,783
And you know that
every time these people

1137
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,651
are hurt all over again.

1138
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,691
You do not feel like
you're some kind of victor.

1139
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,794
You feel like this is
terrible, this is awful.

1140
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,763
I don't want to be a
part of this anymore.

1141
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,599
I don't want to see
people hurt any longer.

1142
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:47,737
Can't we find some way not to
have to do this to each other

1143
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:52,108
over and over and over?

1144
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:55,578
I was at General
Conference 2012.

1145
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:59,648
I was there with the horror
of being called animals

1146
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:05,388
and pedophiles and people
who wanted to molest children

1147
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,624
and all kinds of
horrible things that

1148
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:12,161
were spoken on the floor
of General Conference 2012.

1149
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:15,097
And the bishops who
were leading seemed

1150
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:18,100
impotent to make it stop.

1151
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:23,806
It was really quite--
it shook people up

1152
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,409
and the homophobia in
particular was really bad.

1153
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,811
So it was a very difficult
General Conference.

1154
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:32,148
The only thing that kept
it from being even worse

1155
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,650
is that, on the
penultimate day, a group

1156
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:39,789
of LGBTQ activists
and some supporters

1157
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,825
basically shut the conference
down with a civil disobedience

1158
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:45,394
action at the altar.

1159
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:06,749
For us, it was important
for someone to make it stop.

1160
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:10,186
And making it stop had to
come in the form of protest.

1161
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:17,593
That's not unusual
here in America.

1162
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:23,699
Making injustice stop comes
in the form of protest.

1163
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:28,571
I understand that struggle
because I have been through it,

1164
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:33,375
not as a gay person,
but as a black person.

1165
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,778
Bishop Talbert spent
three days in a jail cell

1166
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,615
with Martin Luther King in
the 1960s, an experience that

1167
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:40,950
changed his life forever.

1168
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,953
When black people were
treated the way they were,

1169
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,888
that was discrimination.

1170
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:46,722
It was wrong.

1171
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:47,923
When women were
treated the way they

1172
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,727
were in the church, that was
discrimination and is wrong.

1173
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:56,432
And when people, because of
their being gay or lesbian,

1174
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:00,803
are treated this way, that's
discrimination and it's unjust.

1175
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,910
In light of the actions taken
by this General Conference,

1176
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:12,915
I believe that the time has
come to call and invite others

1177
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:18,254
to join in what I'm calling
an act of biblical obedience.

1178
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,863
Based on the twofold
commandment of love,

1179
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:30,533
you shall love the Lord, your
God, with all your heart,

1180
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,701
with all your mind,
with all your soul

1181
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:35,371
and with all your strength,
and your neighbor as yourself.

1182
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:43,946
This is our biblical
marching order.

1183
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,348
It was an aha moment.

1184
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:48,017
Biblical obedience.

1185
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,652
And what do we obeying?

1186
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,022
We are obeying the
love of Jesus Christ.

1187
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:56,926
I declare to you that
the derogatory language

1188
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:00,596
and restrictive laws in
The Book of Discipline

1189
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:05,968
are immoral and unjust
and no longer deserve

1190
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,570
our loyalty and obedience.

1191
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,278
An unjust law is no law at all.

1192
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,680
We're tired of waiting.

1193
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:21,016
We're not going to accommodate
this faithlessness.

1194
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,819
This is about having
biblical faith.

1195
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:25,521
And then he gave
us, essentially,

1196
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,590
his Episcopal blessing.

1197
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,693
I call on the more
than 1.100 clergy

1198
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:36,498
to perform marriages
among same sex couples,

1199
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,767
and to do so in
the normal course

1200
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,302
of their pastoral duties.

1201
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,912
That was like, stick a
fork in me, I'm done.

1202
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:51,547
That was the moment.

1203
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,415
That was the moment.

1204
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:57,953
And so biblical
obedience is nothing more

1205
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:06,028
than choosing to do the
right thing, no matter what.

1206
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:10,566
And obviously people
will argue with me

1207
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:15,037
and say how do you know
you're doing the right thing?

1208
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,973
I could be wrong.

1209
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,975
But I doubt it.

1210
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,844
I doubt it.

1211
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,023
They won.

1212
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:35,724
They have their four walls.

1213
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,493
They won their property.

1214
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,128
They're down to
one service, which

1215
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,896
is what they always wanted.

1216
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:42,831
And they won in the
sense that they'll never

1217
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,501
see Pastor Frank in
that pulpit again.

1218
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,604
But then the Lord kind of
wins, because now they'll

1219
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:53,742
see Pastor Frank on CNN, on the
cover of a book, in a movie.

1220
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,944
The world will now
see his ministry.

1221
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,847
We're only going to keep
him to just Lebanon County.

1222
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:14,997
The Reverend Frank Schaefer.

1223
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,475
It is such an honor to
be here this morning.

1224
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,677
My calendar is pretty full.

1225
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,846
For a defrocked minister,
I have an awful lot

1226
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,481
of preaching to do.

1227
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,550
In fact, all of my
Sundays are taken.

1228
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,618
We continue to call
him Reverend because we

1229
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:40,389
believe his ordination
stands in our midst.

1230
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,594
People want to hear
me share the story

1231
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:47,796
and I am more than
willing to do it

1232
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:52,134
because I think sharing my
story will bring healing

1233
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,135
to the church.

1234
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,638
We've been taken into
a homophobic captivity

1235
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,075
and it's been more than
40 years that these rules

1236
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:03,112
and that this language has
been a part of our Discipline.

1237
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,647
And it has cost us.

1238
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:09,485
I really believe that we
are at a tipping point.

1239
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,987
I believe we need to do
everything in our power,

1240
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:16,125
as United Methodists,
to take our church back.

1241
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,162
This is not about doctrine,
this is not about theology.

1242
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,599
It's about the life of people.

1243
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,534
Thank you so much
for your witness.

1244
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:26,769
It's an honor to meet you.

1245
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,670
I'm grateful for what
you did for your son.

1246
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,074
We're backing you
a thousand percent.

1247
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,977
It's been, actually,
healing to be

1248
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:38,647
invited to these churches,
that are open and affirming.

1249
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,151
I hadn't really
seen that before.

1250
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,487
Jimmy's been like a father to
me through this whole process.

1251
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:49,892
Beth like a sister, so thank
you for your encouragement.

1252
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,061
I thought to myself,
you know what?

1253
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,633
I'm not so sure that, once I get
through this, that I will ever

1254
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,803
set foot into a church again.

1255
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:04,506
God asked me to risk
it all and I did.

1256
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:08,510
But look how faithful God is.

1257
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:12,247
Because God said, I'm
not finished with you.

1258
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,616
I'm not finished
with Frank Schaefer.

1259
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,517
I have more to do.

1260
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,758
Frank needs to take
responsibility,

1261
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,895
which, in my opinion
and a lot of others,

1262
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:27,863
he's never done that.

1263
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,898
He's never taken responsibility.

1264
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,701
He's never said I'm sorry.

1265
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,236
I'm sorry, United
Methodist Church.

1266
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,804
I'm sorry, Iona.

1267
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:39,641
I'm sorry for those
that I've hurt.

1268
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,779
He has just simply moved on.

1269
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:47,983
He's the rock star now for
reconciliation, I guess.

1270
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,589
What's next for you?

1271
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,058
You going to stay in Lebanon?

1272
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,059
Hell no.

1273
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,599
No, we're not going
to stay in Lebanon.

1274
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:09,638
We've been offered a place
of ministry in Santa Barbara.

1275
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,107
It's very exciting,
not only because it's

1276
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,877
in sunny California and
it's a great church,

1277
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,880
but because our son
Kevin is there as well.

1278
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,114
I'm excited to have him there.

1279
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:22,651
It'll be really cool to be able
to see them and go for hikes

1280
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,721
or wine tasting or whatever.

1281
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:28,757
I have mixed feelings,
because three of our kids

1282
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:30,125
are still here on
the east coast,

1283
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:35,998
so it's going to be
a little hard for me.

1284
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:46,208
It's been 18 years
in Lebanon County

1285
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:50,212
and we've made a lot of
friends, but there's also

1286
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:54,082
been a lot of disappointments
and very stressful times

1287
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,717
for me and my family.

1288
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:58,921
So I think it's time
for us to move on.

1289
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:01,857
We'll miss you so much.

1290
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,294
We'll miss you so much.

1291
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,762
We'll come see you, I hope.

1292
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,697
Absolutely.

1293
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,698
OK.

1294
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,166
Just don't forget about us.

1295
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,335
My gosh.

1296
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,238
No, no, no, no, no.

1297
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,306
I just got this yesterday.

1298
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,374
I haven't even opened it yet.

1299
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:24,279
Wow.

1300
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:24,913
My goodness.

1301
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:25,881
I love it.

1302
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:26,848
There you go.

1303
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,317
One for you, too.

1304
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,785
How neat.

1305
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:30,886
That's beautiful.

1306
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,322
Some of the back story's
in there, some of the dirt.

1307
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:39,194
The concerned group.

1308
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:40,762
I'm going to vomit.

1309
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:44,066
The concerned group.

1310
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,168
He'll always be my pastor,
my pastor in my heart.

1311
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:47,936
You know, that's the
way I think of Frank.

1312
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,272
He'll always be my
pastor, wherever he is.

1313
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,139
Don't you think?

1314
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:51,940
Yeah.

1315
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,008
I think a lot of
people think that.

1316
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,009
Yeah.

1317
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,148
When we kids, my parents would
talk a lot about California, as

1318
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,017
like the place that
they wanted to end up.

1319
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:05,387
To me, it's a beautiful,
beautiful place.

1320
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,223
It's like paradise.

1321
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:12,327
I think we sort of deserve this,
because we went through hell.

1322
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:14,796
And we're going to end up in
paradise, at least for a while.

1323
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:18,033
So California here we come.

1324
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,086
Our guest is Frank Schaefer.

1325
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:42,491
He was defrocked in 2013 by
the United Methodist Church.

1326
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:47,863
He was reinstated on an
appeal in June of 2014,

1327
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,198
but that reinstatement
is being appealed

1328
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,801
before the denomination's
highest court today.

1329
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,041
This is our Supreme
Court, so to speak,

1330
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:01,076
of the United Methodist Church.

1331
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:01,977
So it's a very big day.

1332
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,112
There's no appeal
possible after this.

1333
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,313
This is the final word.

1334
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:18,360
This case is no longer
about LGBT issues.

1335
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:22,097
The trial court's findings
of guilt were not appealed

1336
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,133
and the other
aspects of that issue

1337
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,370
are properly the work
of General Conference.

1338
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:32,974
Some have suggested that this
is a decision that is ultimately

1339
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,210
going to split the church.

1340
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,179
We've seen other churches
go through this, too,

1341
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,180
sort of around the world.

1342
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,382
Is there really a threat
here of basically two

1343
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,118
Methodist Churches
emerging from this?

1344
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,953
If left to stand,
the appeal decision

1345
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,189
will do harm to the
church because it clearly

1346
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:51,359
communicates that it's
OK to ignore and violate

1347
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,128
the Discipline.

1348
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,297
When Bishop Carcano
invited Frank Schaefer

1349
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:58,567
to come to California
and serve in ministry,

1350
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,169
she was essentially
undermining the whole covenant

1351
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:02,938
of United Methodism.

1352
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:06,942
We simply cannot feel good about
being in a church that allows

1353
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:11,980
its pastors to promote something
that we believe to be sinful.

1354
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,548
Churches need to change
from the bottom up.

1355
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,384
That's been a major focus
of the work that we do,

1356
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,487
but it does need to
change at the top.

1357
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,323
No people will continue
to allow themselves

1358
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:24,259
to be discriminated against.

1359
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:27,129
During the long process
that led up to his trial,

1360
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:31,867
Frank began to see all of the
ways in which our church is

1361
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,104
doing harm to our gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender

1362
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,241
brothers and
sisters, and decided

1363
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:44,045
that he could no longer remain
silent in such circumstances.

1364
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,983
The future has to
be our willingness

1365
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,286
to live with our differences.

1366
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,422
I'm not trying to convert
all of those who are

1367
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:58,426
evangelicals to be progressive.

1368
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,964
They can make their witness
but let me make mine too

1369
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,366
in my church.

1370
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,903
This is as much my
church as it is yours.

1371
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,005
Rather than hurting
each other, rather than

1372
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,207
damaging the
church, why don't we

1373
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,176
set each other free
to pursue what we

1374
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,378
believe God would have us do?

1375
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,948
It just may be that more
work for the cause of Christ

1376
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,250
would be done if
we didn't use so

1377
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:26,388
much of our time, our
resources, our finances

1378
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:32,360
to fight this battle that's
never going to be resolved.

1379
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:35,263
Thank you very much for your
thoughtful and prayerful

1380
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:39,301
consideration of this matter
and the church rests with that.

1381
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:58,386
I don't think I would be
ready for another defrocking.

1382
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:02,190
But I know that
I'll get through it

1383
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:03,625
because, if there's
one thing I've

1384
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:05,193
learned through this
whole experience,

1385
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:07,696
it's that if you
do what is right,

1386
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,398
God is not going
to let you down.

1387
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:14,369
And it's been incredible, the
support has been incredible.

1388
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,438
So I'm not afraid of it.

1389
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,106
I know it's going
to be devastating

1390
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:21,276
if it does indeed happen,
but I'm not afraid of it.

1391
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,648
Our top story, the
United Methodist Church

1392
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:31,086
has ruled in the case of former
Lebanon County pastor Frank
Schaefer.

1393
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:32,320
This case has gone
back and forth,

1394
01:21:32,354 --> 01:21:34,356
but the decision that
was announced today

1395
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,958
is the final one and the United
Methodist Church's highest

1396
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,427
court has ruled that
Frank Schaefer can remain

1397
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:40,528
a minister in the church.

1398
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:44,299
The judicial council
reinstated him as a clergyman.

1399
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,269
Upheld a decision to reinstate
Reverend Frank Schaefer.

1400
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:51,373
I'm so glad it's over and done
with and I'm still a reverend.

1401
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,476
He plans to continue to
fight for inclusion of gays

1402
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,511
and lesbians in the church.

1403
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:06,087
They reinstated me as a
United Methodist minister,

1404
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:09,291
sending a very clear signal
that things are changing

1405
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:10,558
in the United Methodist Church.

1406
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:12,227
And that is my
commitment, I want

1407
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,997
to continue to change
things from the inside out.

1408
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,066
This afternoon, a
spokeswoman for the church

1409
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:22,270
said the next General Conference
is in 2016 and, at that time,

1410
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,539
legislation could be
brought up to change

1411
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:26,041
their stance on homosexuality.

1412
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:30,712
In the past, I
had really thought

1413
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:33,481
I should go into
the ministry myself.

1414
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,583
And now those feelings
are all coming back

1415
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,385
and now there's a
different component.

1416
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,688
I would love to be within
the Methodist Church

1417
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:42,424
and continue to fight
for what my dad has

1418
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,527
started to fight for.

1419
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,395
Reverend Schaefer,
the people who

1420
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:51,700
reinstated you know that this
is something you might do again.

1421
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:53,034
Absolutely.

1422
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:53,768
I mean, I was very
clear on that.

1423
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,637
I never made it a secret.

1424
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:58,773
I said I will perform another
gay marriage if I'm asked to.

1425
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,312
We met on Facebook
through friends.

1426
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:07,282
I asked him to go and have
coffee with me at Starbucks

1427
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,719
and kind of went from there.

1428
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,587
John and I are very compatible.

1429
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,356
We want the same
things out of life

1430
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,157
and we have the same values.

1431
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:20,528
So this is a keeper.

1432
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:24,366
John and I are engaged and
my dad, the first thing

1433
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,168
that he said when I called
him, after my mom had told him

1434
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:31,806
we were engaged, my dad said,
do you have something to ask me?

1435
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,111
I haven't officially asked my
dad, but he knows it's coming.
