1
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,882
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

2
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,384
I'm not selling. Tell your boss.

3
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,508
Did you get all that?

4
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,313
Last call!

5
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,451
Black Pelican. Yeah.

6
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,424
Boss!

7
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,221
You got a phone call.

8
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,797
Thank you. Hello.

9
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,561
Nate, I don't know if you know this,
but we got a big problem here.

10
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,068
What are we talking about?

11
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:31,642
Some of the boys working for you
might not be as loyal as you think.

12
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,277
Who are we talking about?

13
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,539
I'll tell you everything,
but not on the phone.

14
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,344
Meet me at the Drift-ln Pier
in 30 minutes.

15
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,001
-What's up?
-Hey.

16
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,141
Ladies.

17
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,612
Are you dealing?

18
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,264
-DEA!
-Stay where you are.

19
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,094
-Hands where I can see them!
-Let me see your hands.

20
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,828
Let's go. All right, up, let's go.

21
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,904
-Haul them out of here.
-Come here.

22
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,841
I got this one.

23
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:31,727
You know, I kind of like this gig.

24
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,796
Kind of turns me on.

25
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,351
I think you should take off
these cuffs.

26
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,251
If I take off these cuffs...

27
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,354
...how do I know
you're not gonna run?

28
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,561
You should think about this
for a second career.

29
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:11,032
-You're pretty good at it.
-Why, thank you.

30
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,265
You know, I'd love to stay and play...

31
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,494
...but I got a job to do.

32
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,272
Shane, where are you going?

33
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,306
You really think all this
cloak-and-dagger stuff is necessary?

34
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,149
-I should've known.
-It's your last chance.

35
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,662
Sell, or I'll gladly kill you right now.

36
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,862
Go to hell.

37
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,941
You still can't win an honest fight.

38
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,212
Honest fight?
There ain't no such thing.

39
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,721
I promised you that I was
gonna take everything you had...

40
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,324
...when you kicked me out.

41
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,358
So you could deal your filthy drugs.

42
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,429
Crawling on the ground
and you're still on your high horse.

43
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,725
Standing there with a gun
like a tough guy...

44
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,834
...you're still a pathetic punk.

45
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,561
Later, Nate.
It sucked knowing you.

46
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,646
Somebody send for my Feds.

47
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,477
Tanner.

48
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,345
Shit.

49
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,522
I put you undercover
for four months...

50
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,521
...and all you give me
is Freddie fucking Rogers?

51
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,694
Where's the big one
you keep promising me?

52
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,054
Hold on. Yeah?

53
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,820
-Shane Tanner?
-Yes.

54
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,523
This is Deputy Garland Hendricks
of Tyree Parish Sheriff's Department.

55
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:39,068
-Are you Nate Tanner's next of kin?
-Yeah, he's my uncle.

56
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,763
Well, I sure am sorry
to have to tell you this...

57
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,843
...but we found him earlier
this evening in pretty bad shape.

58
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,308
-What happened?
-Well...

59
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,846
...Iooks like somebody
beat the hell out of him.

60
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,813
-What hospital?
-Shumpert.

61
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,680
Down here in Tyree, Louisiana.

62
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,658
-Where are you going, Tanner?
-I got a lead on that big one.

63
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,763
-What do you got?
-Can't say just yet?

64
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,661
If you don't tell me, you can't go.

65
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,462
Well, then consider me
on temporary leave.

66
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,538
-Shane, where are you going?
-Louisiana.

67
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,870
What's in Louisiana?

68
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,513
My uncle's in the hospital.
I gotta get down there.

69
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,683
-I'll come with you.
-No, I'll be fine.

70
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,115
-Want me to take you to the airport?
-I don't fly. Too dangerous.

71
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,185
Don't tell that prick where I'm going.

72
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,822
When you question Freddie...

73
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,185
...see if he knows anything
about my father's death.

74
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,022
-Think he had something to do with it?
-No, but always ask.

75
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,092
Hey, Luthor.

76
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,634
I'm sorry to hear about Nate.
It's a shame.

77
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:29,637
My attorney will be by in a couple
of days with some paperwork.

78
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,717
I'm sure Nate's ready to sell by now.

79
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,916
Sure thing, Bill.

80
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,091
-Nice boots, dude.
-How'd you like them up your ass?

81
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,069
Stupid whore!

82
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:58,235
Hey, Nate made it clear Bill and those
assholes aren't supposed to be in here.

83
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,242
Look what happened to him.

84
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,280
Well, Nate's still the boss.

85
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,422
-What do you want?
-Thought you could use a hand.

86
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:53,957
I'm fine.

87
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,135
-Here, let me help.
-Hey!

88
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,838
Just wanna help.

89
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,610
Could you hand me
one of those lug nuts?

90
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,448
Thanks.

91
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,052
Another one.

92
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,122
Hey, knight in shining armour...

93
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,527
...am I supposed to know you
from somewhere?

94
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,430
I don't think so.
I don't live around here.

95
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,696
Yeah, no kidding.

96
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,512
Look out!

97
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,623
Asshole!

98
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,635
-Who was that?
-You don't wanna know.

99
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,263
Well...

100
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,103
...I'm done.

101
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,707
Get to a gas station.

102
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,580
The tire's a little low,
it needs air, all right?

103
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,347
-Where are you headed?
-Shumpert Hospital.

104
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,354
If you take this road
as far as it goes...

105
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,789
-...then take up the old cemetery--
-I know.

106
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,623
I thought you said
you weren't from around here.

107
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,264
I used to be.

108
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,292
-So the boss is happy?
-Oh, yes. I'm very happy.

109
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,329
-I meant Mr. Crost.
-Mr. Crost is an overseer.

110
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,906
This is my parish.

111
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,567
An overseer, huh? That's why
he gets 80 percent and you get 20.

112
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,110
Not for long.

113
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,475
Now, get out of my face,
you're pissing me off.

114
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,262
This is for Ducky and his brothers,
tonight at last call.

115
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,996
Don't bother me with the details.

116
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,550
You must be Nate's nephew.

117
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,626
I'm Deputy Hendricks.
I spoke to you on the phone.

118
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,661
Shane Tanner.

119
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,663
-So how is he doing?
-The doctor said he's stabilized.

120
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,399
-They're gonna move him out of lC.
-Well, that's good.

121
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,907
That's-- That's real good.

122
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:30,377
-You guys find who did it yet?
-Well, we're looking into it.

123
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:36,748
I figure it's just a case
of wrong place, wrong time.

124
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,086
Wrong place, wrong time, huh?

125
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:47,024
Yeah, that's--
That's what I figure.

126
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,757
That happen a lot around here?

127
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,663
Wrong place, wrong time?

128
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,499
Look, son, you're upset,
I understand that.

129
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,301
But you shouldn't have come
all the way down here.

130
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,808
There's nothing you can do.

131
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,878
Is that right?

132
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,481
Someone's gotta run the Pelican
until my uncle's back on his feet.

133
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:14,588
And if you guys ain't gonna
find out who did it, I will.

134
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,414
All right, punch it now.
Hit it hard.

135
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,019
Come on. Hit it again.

136
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,158
Hands up. Get your hands up, Shane.
Punch him.

137
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,988
Step back, step back. Side kick.

138
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,495
There you go. Hit that bag.

139
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,559
Come on, hit that bag hard, boy.
Come on.

140
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:07,838
I believe in you, boy. Come on.

141
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,443
Hey.

142
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,704
Hey.

143
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,755
You must be hungry, huh? Yeah?

144
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:09,056
Okay, K.P., that's it for tonight.
Let's wind it up, okay?

145
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,104
Last call! Last call for alcohol!

146
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,714
Hey!

147
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,644
You look familiar.
Do I know you?

148
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,319
Yeah, I run this joint now.

149
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,419
No shit. You're Nate's nephew.
I heard all about you.

150
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,121
-You're Dalton's kid, right?
-Yes.

151
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,167
-You as tough as your daddy was?
-Opinions vary.

152
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,002
Don't you know who the fuck I am?
Fucking name is Mr. Marcus.

153
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,904
Stepping on my shoe,
are you crazy?

154
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,376
Name is Mr. Marcus, you understand?
Repeat it, "Mr. Fucking Marcus."

155
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,709
That's Marcus Reynolds.
He's bad news.

156
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,012
Just for that, wash my fucking car
and pay my tab, bitch.

157
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,883
Repeat after me. What's my name?

158
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,388
-Marcus.
-What? What?

159
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,820
Mr. Marcus.

160
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,927
You boys having fun?

161
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,928
Hold my glasses.

162
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,062
Who the hell are you?

163
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,802
Stick your pretty ass
somewhere else.

164
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,494
I'm afraid I can't do that.

165
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,474
Yeah, he can't do that.

166
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,802
Let me show him what he can do.

167
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,674
Let's get these guys out of here.

168
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,660
Keep this shit out of my club.

169
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:24,163
Holy shit. You're Dalton's kid.

170
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,530
Heard all about you.

171
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,537
Thought you'd be bigger.

172
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,541
So, what happened in there?
You talk to the cops yet?

173
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,238
Yeah, this deputy said
it was some random thing.

174
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,917
Random my ass.

175
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,451
Wild Bill's been making runs
at buying this place for a while now.

176
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,453
Every time I ask Nate about it,
he just clams up.

177
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,286
I don't think those two
like each other very much.

178
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,128
-Who's this Wild Bill?
-He's an ex-cooler.

179
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,424
He used to work for your uncle.
He is one big, bad dude.

180
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,092
-Why does he want the Pelican?
-Location, location, location.

181
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,400
See, the Pelican happens to occupy
some prime-ass real estate...

182
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,202
...when it comes to the exciting world
of drug running.

183
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,744
You're not too far from the border,
directly between Texas and Florida.

184
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,610
You can transport through
the swamp virtually undetected.

185
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,254
You. You got 10 seconds to walk
out of here before I throw you out.

186
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:21,222
-Luthor, do you know who this guy is?
-I don't give a shit who he is.

187
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:25,192
This is Nate's nephew.
This is Shane Tanner.

188
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,593
Excuse me a second, boys.

189
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,066
Oh, before everyone leaves tonight, l'd
like to have a little chat with the staff.

190
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,137
This is a nice surprise.

191
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,775
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for helping me out. So thanks.

192
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,813
-Can I buy you a drink?
-I don't drink.

193
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,414
I just wanted say thank you.

194
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:53,215
-You're leaving already?
-I'm sure I'll see you around.

195
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:08,862
Hey!

196
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,473
I didn't get your name.

197
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:22,151
Yo, chief, the fine pair of jeans
you were talking to left this at the bar.

198
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,521
She'll come back for it.

199
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:33,557
As you probably all know by now,
I'm Nate's nephew, Shane.

200
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,858
I'll be looking after the club for a while
and looking after it properly.

201
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,163
Luthor, guys were dealing shit inside.

202
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,170
Nate didn't allow it, I won't either.

203
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,072
We sell booze in here, not drugs.
Is that clear?

204
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:54,713
Over the years, Nate told me
who he trusted, who had his back.

205
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,054
Now I need to know
who's got mine.

206
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,847
You ever run a club before?

207
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:04,620
I know how my uncle ran a club,
and how my father ran a club.

208
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,990
Three rules were lived by
in the Pelican.

209
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,067
Rule number one:.

210
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,203
Never underestimate anyone
or any situation.

211
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,238
Rule number two:.
Take it outside.

212
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:20,104
Someone gives you trouble inside,
escort them out.

213
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,577
-Rule number three--
-Be nice...

214
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,683
...until it's time to not be nice.

215
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,182
You need to know...

216
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,652
...those guys you
kicked out of here earlier...

217
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:33,881
...work for Wild Bill.

218
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,856
I keep hearing about this Wild Bill.

219
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,963
You think he had anything to do with
my uncle winding up in the hospital?

220
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:45,603
Wild Bill's got his hands in just about
everything that goes on in this town.

221
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,103
Great. Can't wait to meet him.

222
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,298
A new owner? Who the fuck--?

223
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,170
Look, I don't know. Some guy.

224
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,678
Somebody bought the Black Pelican
out from under my nose?

225
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,282
-Boss, phone.
-Are you interrupting me?

226
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:04,785
-It's Miami.
-I'll take it inside.

227
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,285
Hello.

228
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,227
When you started working for me, Bill,
you wanted money...

229
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:19,802
...power and influence
in that quaint little parish of yours.

230
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:25,307
-You got that now. You know why?
-Because we don't have problems.

231
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,673
The Duffy Brothers have been clients
of ours for a long time.

232
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,849
It is a problem when they don't
get their merchandise.

233
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,417
It doesn't make me feel confident
you can handle the De Marco deal.

234
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,917
I can handle it.

235
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,488
Securing Antoine De Marco
and his connections...

236
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:44,185
...will finally legitimize us
as a premier operation in Louisiana.

237
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,694
You better be able to handle it.

238
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,237
-ls everything okay, baby?
-Yeah, it's good.

239
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,372
We need the Pelican.

240
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,736
So I want you all to get on the horn
with the lawyers...

241
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,707
...and make that place mine,
do you hear me?

242
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,355
Well, Mr. Tanner.

243
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:53,189
A pleasure.
How's that hammer hanging?

244
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,832
My name is Embry Davis.

245
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,033
I've been authorized
by Mr. William Decarie...

246
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:11,910
...to offer you 400,000 dollars cash
to take this bar off your hands.

247
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,584
It's not even worth half that.

248
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,879
Mr. Decarie is being very generous
with this offer.

249
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,750
Well, tell him I said thank you,
but it's not for sale.

250
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:25,419
Son, I don't think you understand
the subtleties of all this.

251
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,359
Problem, boss?

252
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,928
Something wrong with you, boy?

253
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,935
You know why
they call me the robot?

254
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,941
Because I'm so automatic
at kicking your ass.

255
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,247
-You retarded?
-Learning impaired.

256
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,446
I think what my friend
is trying to say is, take a walk.

257
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,683
Yeah, well....

258
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,925
Good day, girls.

259
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:08,772
-Thanks.
-Want you to know we got your back.

260
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,305
-How's everything going today?
-It's all right.

261
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,039
Hendricks.

262
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,578
-That's good.
-There you go.

263
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,977
-Thank you, sir.
-Keep the change.

264
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,016
-Any leads?
-No.

265
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:28,454
Did you ask Marcus Reynolds where
he was the night Nate got jumped?

266
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,355
We had to let Reynolds go.

267
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,587
Sheriff said there wasn't
enough evidence.

268
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,822
I found two ounces of crystal
on his person.

269
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,695
-Well, his lawyers said it was planted.
-Planted?

270
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,631
That's bullshit, and you know it.

271
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:45,967
We do what we can around here,
but there's only three of us and it's....

272
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,475
Well, it's complicated.

273
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,811
You wanna go after Wild Bill Decarie
and his boys...

274
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,248
...you're gonna need some
major firepower.

275
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,321
Marcus Reynolds
works for Wild Bill?

276
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,691
We all do.

277
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:25,539
Monyhan, it's Tanner.
I need a favor.

278
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,310
Call me back as soon as you can.

279
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,872
Cocktail?

280
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,885
Get that ass up.

281
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,394
-Here you go.
-Fucking always clears the mind.

282
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,170
Nice work there, boss. Nice work.

283
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,799
So Dalton's kid is in town
to save the day, huh?

284
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,307
Yep.

285
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,675
-But he won't sell?
-Won't budge.

286
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,507
We got two buyers coming in
from Watkins Parish this weekend...

287
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,620
...plus we got the De Marco
deal next week.

288
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:42,555
Now, I wanna be able to celebrate
in Wild Bill's Black Pelican.

289
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,627
-My new center of operations.
-I hear you, boss.

290
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:52,631
They thought Dalton was a legend.
Wait till they get ahold of me.

291
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,763
Shane Tanner, huh?

292
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:02,945
It's a long time.
It's a pity what happened to his father.

293
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,311
If he don't sell,
I'm gonna fucking squash him.

294
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:12,785
I'll take care--
Well, hello, my little rose petal.

295
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,721
Embry Davis is the name.

296
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,492
Nice backstroke, boss.

297
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,326
Goodbye, ladies.

298
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,162
Rack them up!

299
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,008
Yeah?

300
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,739
It's rude to answer
someone else's phone.

301
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,214
But I thought you'd call
sooner or later.

302
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,319
Just waiting by the phone, huh?

303
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,249
Is it okay if I call you right back?

304
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,492
I'm-- I'm out running errands.

305
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,194
Or l-- I could stop by later...

306
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,458
...and drop off your phone.

307
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,495
I'm kind of busy right now.

308
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:09,002
I'm running errands myself.

309
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,072
Are you sure?

310
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,708
It won't take long.

311
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,803
Half hour tops.

312
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,274
All right, I guess it's the least I can do
for your changing my tire.

313
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,183
Great.

314
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,385
Oh, hey, baby.

315
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,506
Good morning.

316
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,643
Oh, my God.

317
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:28,809
I'm so sorry.

318
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,547
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude
to break into someone else's house?

319
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,054
Well, the door was open.

320
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,919
-Are you okay?
-No.

321
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,392
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

322
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,030
Nice move.

323
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,231
You know,
I could've blew your head off.

324
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:53,171
I almost blew yours off.

325
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,005
I figured I'd come over here
and get my phone...

326
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,375
...and see if I could take you out
for coffee.

327
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,778
-You could've called.
-Didn't have my phone.

328
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,620
-Use a pay phone.
-Didn't have your number.

329
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,913
-How'd you know where I was staying?
-Chubby told me.

330
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,056
Here's your phone.

331
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,292
You know...

332
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,610
...I finally got you in my bedroom,
and I still don't know your name.

333
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,472
That sounds like a country song.

334
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,410
I finally got you in my bed room
And I still don't know your name

335
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,553
Beau. My name is Beau.

336
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,917
Hurry up.
I'll get you that cup of coffee.

337
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,698
-Where did you learn to kick like that?
-Girl Scouts.

338
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,267
Girls Scouts are pretty tough
around here, huh?

339
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,166
It does wonders
for the cookie sales.

340
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,235
If you don't buy any,
we kick your ass.

341
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,956
Are you a cop?

342
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,556
That was a Glock
you were pointing at me.

343
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,737
I'm a federal agent.
Drug enforcement.

344
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,034
But you gotta keep that
to yourself, okay?

345
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,679
Surprised you haven't been
down here sooner.

346
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,276
This place is a hotbed
for drug activity.

347
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,751
What's the sheriff doing about it?

348
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,719
Trust me, local law enforcement...

349
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,758
...doesn't always have
the people's interest at heart.

350
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,698
Friend of yours?

351
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,275
She's in the Brownies.

352
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,746
-Girl Scouts hate Brownies.
-Hi, Ms. Hampton.

353
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,939
-Hey, Betsy, how was your summer?
-lt was good.

354
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,811
-I get to see you soon, huh?
-Yeah.

355
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,011
Can't wait for school to start.
Go tell your mom I say, "Hey."

356
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,951
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

357
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,819
-School teacher?
-Elementary.

358
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,156
She's one of my best students.

359
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,201
I gotta take this. Hey.

360
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,772
-Where the hell are you?
-I'm down in Louisiana.

361
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,205
Have you heard of a dealer
named Bill Decarie?

362
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,072
Afraid not. What's up?

363
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,906
Could you check him out for me?

364
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,909
Sure thing, buddy.
Soon as I get done here.

365
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,450
-Thanks, man.
-Hey, gotta run. Stay cool.

366
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,045
Jesus.

367
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,181
I'll call you later.

368
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,933
Are you sure you don't need help?

369
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,438
Nate used to talk about you
all the time.

370
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,616
What a tough little fucker you were.

371
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,512
And then your daddy got killed...

372
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,208
...and you split town.

373
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,389
So listen, your....

374
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,650
Your latest offer
was very persuasive.

375
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,887
I think Nate would be
more than happy with the cash...

376
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,463
...so why don't you stop by the bar
and we will--

377
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,066
We'll work something out.

378
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,565
Perfect.

379
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,705
I got some business associates
coming into town this weekend.

380
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,671
How about I bring them by the bar?

381
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,777
-We'll kill two birds with one stone.
-Saturday night it is.

382
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,769
Boys, we've been expecting you.

383
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,612
Where is the pretty boy?

384
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,748
Shane Tanner, in the flesh.

385
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,849
I thought you'd be bigger.

386
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,028
I'll make this easy.

387
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,629
I'll sell for 400 grand...

388
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,361
...plus whatever it takes
to refurnish Nate's place.

389
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:22,232
So send over the paperwork,
and I'll sign whatever you want.

390
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,374
And in the meantime,
we reserved our best table upstairs...

391
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,544
...for you and your friends.

392
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,944
It's a mighty kind offer.

393
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:35,016
But I think I'd like something
a little more private.

394
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,551
Hey, guys.

395
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,693
You, get out of here.
Get, get!

396
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,006
-Change of plan.
-Okay.

397
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,736
Morales, go watch that door
over there.

398
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,040
Everybody ready?

399
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,582
All right, show him the goods.

400
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,381
See what you got.

401
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,374
Hold on.

402
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,248
-Setup!
-Shit.

403
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,290
We have been made!
Move, move, move!

404
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,907
Everybody get down, he's got a gun!

405
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,847
DEA. Show me your hands!

406
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:20,587
I got it. Cover them.

407
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,830
Freeze! Get down! Get down!

408
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,833
Get-- Get down!

409
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:44,442
-Move this boat or I'll kill you!
-Put it out! Put it out!

410
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,640
Move it! Move it!
Move this thing or I'll kill her! Move it!

411
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,292
And technically the sheriff is right.

412
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:09,336
It does fall under his jurisdiction.
He should have been told.

413
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,305
Yeah.

414
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,671
Listen, I gotta get back tonight.

415
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,174
You take care of yourself.

416
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,681
Not only do you have that slick fucker
pissed at you, but the way I hear it...

417
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,945
...Captain Stenton back in New York
considers you AWOL.

418
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,180
I forgot all about him.

419
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,722
Look, Shane...

420
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,595
...I know coming back down here
must be eating you up inside.

421
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,901
Just make sure you cover your ass.

422
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,166
Besides, with the message
we sent tonight...

423
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,206
...he'd be crazy to come
anywhere near here.

424
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,304
Okay.

425
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,845
More trouble in Tyree Parish.
What a fucking surprise.

426
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,886
I've got the De Marco meeting
Saturday night.

427
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,650
Never send in a minor leaguer...

428
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,885
...to pitch game seven
of the World Series.

429
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,828
-Stone, get the plane ready.
-You got it.

430
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,764
Well, I just lost two more bouncers.

431
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,965
Said they'd rather quit
than end up dead.

432
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,110
Bill wouldn't come back here, right?

433
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,212
The place was swarming
with federal agents and shit.

434
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,041
He'll stay away, right?

435
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,344
We're closing the Pelican down
for a while until things cool off.

436
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,351
Well, I'll let the boys go home,
get some sleep.

437
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,683
We'll come back tomorrow,
clean the place up.

438
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,223
Thanks.

439
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,792
I'll stop by and lend a hand.

440
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,402
You can feel it in the air, boss.

441
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,595
-There's some heavy shit going down.
-Yeah.

442
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,069
No kidding.

443
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,472
Watch out, man.
Wild Bill's got a lot of soldiers.

444
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,448
Oh, God,
I hate this fucking shithole.

445
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,621
How charming.

446
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:42,690
You live in a fucking swamp,
you know that, Bill?

447
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:47,159
Hey, the swamp is a--
Hey, do not play with that.

448
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,525
-You giving my men orders?
-No.

449
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,464
I just expect a little respect.

450
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,467
Respect?

451
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:01,706
The DEA and the FBl
are all over J.B. Watkins...

452
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,379
...and you want my respect?

453
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,772
You need to earn it.

454
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:11,320
Look at you. You're a wild dog
playing at middle management.

455
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,158
I want the Dalton kid
and any of his associates dead.

456
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,296
And I want it over in two days...

457
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,089
...so we can seal De Marco...

458
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,267
...and I can get home
for the Marlins game.

459
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,867
Nate Tanner?

460
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,906
Thanks.

461
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,183
Hey.

462
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,220
Hey, hey!

463
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,891
What are you doing here?

464
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,658
What the hell am I doing here?

465
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,127
You got jumped
by Bill Decarie and his boys.

466
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,062
Luthor set me up.

467
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,862
-I'll take care of him.
-Yeah.

468
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,369
I'll come with you.
I'm tired of being in here.

469
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,666
I gotta get out of here.

470
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,375
Maybe not just yet. I....

471
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,411
Listen, don't worry about Luthor.

472
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,283
He's nothing, meaningless.
But don't underestimate Wild Bill.

473
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,893
Uncle Nate, I'm sorry,
but I had to close down the Pelican.

474
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,790
Things got a little out of control.

475
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,398
Listen, don't be too hard
on yourself, okay?

476
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,592
That place is destined for trouble.
The location--

477
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,739
Yeah, location, location, location.

478
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,710
Shit.

479
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,402
It's good to see you.

480
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,142
It's good to see you.

481
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,183
Been a long time.

482
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,487
Been a long time.

483
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,555
Listen, you gotta
promise me something.

484
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,921
You gotta promise me
that you'll be careful down here.

485
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,459
It is not like the old days.

486
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,655
You can't settle things
with your fists and sweat anymore.

487
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,892
This millennium,
they shoot first, ask questions later.

488
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,461
You don't know who to trust,
nobody's straight...

489
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,909
...or true anymore.

490
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,111
Oh, man.

491
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,113
You know, your dad
got one thing wrong. Pain does hurt.

492
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,169
You stay away from that pretty boy
over at the Pelican tonight...

493
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,372
...unless you
wanna get yourself killed.

494
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,278
-Yeah?
-It's Beau.

495
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,708
Oh, hey.

496
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,483
So you think you could take a lady
on a proper date tonight?

497
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,587
Well, I'm here at the hospital
right now.

498
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,122
And I'm supposed to go over to
the Pelican tonight and help clean up.

499
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,193
-Well, you have to eat, right?
-Yeah.

500
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,388
What would your uncle say
if you said no to a pretty woman...

501
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,999
...after she begged you for a date?

502
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:50,330
-You're right. I'll pick you up at (.
-Make it 7.

503
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,247
Well, I hope she has a nice ass.

504
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,982
I thought you were sleeping.

505
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,749
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

506
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,517
Go have some fun.
I'll be all right in a couple days.

507
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,782
We'll take care of all this.

508
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,825
Who do you trust?

509
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,454
I'll catch you later.

510
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,033
You look wonderful.

511
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,373
-Thank you.
-So shall we?

512
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,424
So how come
you don't have a boyfriend?

513
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,463
Who says I don't?

514
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:32,131
I haven't found a guy that's safe
enough or strong enough, I guess.

515
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,140
You see, most guys either have
too much testosterone...

516
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,210
...or they're just too passive.

517
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,879
Well, I guess
that takes me out of the mix.

518
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,251
Why is that,
too much testosterone?

519
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,683
You're too scared to make a move?

520
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:48,922
No, the safe part.

521
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:53,585
You said you needed a guy
who's safe enough. That's not me.

522
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:59,727
No. I meant safe enough
to give my heart to.

523
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:21,823
See, my father travelled around a lot,
so I spent most of my teens with Nate.

524
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,552
He was the one who pushed me
to go to college, get an education.

525
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,664
And when my father died,
Nate was the only family I had left.

526
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:35,099
-How'd it happen, your dad?
-He was murdered.

527
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,629
Oh, my God.

528
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:43,575
I came home from work one night and
I found him dead in the living room.

529
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,907
He'd been shot.

530
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,143
-You know who did it?
-I still don't know.

531
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:55,224
I let my father borrow my car
that night, he pulled in the driveway...

532
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:58,553
...he walked in, someone shot him.

533
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,559
I figured they must have
thought it was me.

534
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,700
I'm the one
who's supposed to be dead.

535
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,018
I gotta get you back.
I gotta get to the Pelican.

536
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,088
-Help the boys clean up.
-Don't go.

537
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,629
Let's go back to my place.

538
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,994
I really should go over.

539
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,037
What would your uncle say
if you said no...

540
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,738
...to a passionate young woman?

541
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,081
I gotta get going. I'm late.

542
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,552
Oh, no, no.
Don't you leave me all alone.

543
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,884
I can come back.

544
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,934
I'm coming with you.

545
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,331
Is he....

546
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:29,197
-Help.
-Chubby.

547
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:35,901
Chubby.

548
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,174
Luthor.

549
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,885
Luthor let them in.

550
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:50,048
-Hello?
-It's Tanner.

551
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,561
Tanner, where are you?

552
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:56,220
There's a problem.
Can you meet me at the Pelican?

553
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,059
Yeah.

554
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:12,139
Crost, this is Luthor.

555
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:14,578
Tanner wants me to meet him
at the Pelican.

556
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,480
All right, we'll be there
in 10 minutes.

557
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,552
Good.

558
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,199
This is for Nate.

559
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,002
I was supposed to be
at the club.

560
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,737
I'm the one who's supposed
to be dead, right?

561
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,477
Why don't you ask your little bitch?

562
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,588
They're going to the girl's house.

563
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,599
Once again, you want something
done right, you gotta do it yourself.

564
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:11,198
We'll take care of Tanner,
you go pay his uncle a visit.

565
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,467
Then we'll all meet back here
for the De Marco meeting.

566
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:18,503
You fuck this up, I'll fuck you up.

567
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,114
Let's get out of here.

568
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,188
Fuck, I hate this shit.

569
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,784
My town.

570
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,994
My bird.

571
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,010
Tell the boys to get ready.

572
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,840
We've got some unfinished business
over at the hospital.

573
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,260
-Hello?
-You better get out of that house.

574
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:07,952
Trouble's coming.

575
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,602
-You knew it was gonna happen.
-Shane.

576
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,933
You asked me out
to keep me from the Pelican.

577
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,438
-Listen--
-Why'd you do it?

578
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,543
Listen to me.

579
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,175
Bill just called.

580
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,547
-They're on their way here to kill you.
-Why would he call you?

581
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:08,015
The same reason he warned me
about the Pelican. He's my cousin.

582
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,307
Hey, hey. Can I help you?

583
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,943
Hey, hey, hey, put that away.

584
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,844
I didn't know anyone would get hurt.
They wanted you.

585
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,212
And as long as you're with me,
I thought--

586
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:43,281
-Girl Scouts?
-Army. It paid for my college.

587
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,594
You go that way, over here.

588
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:38,437
Goddamn it!

589
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,379
Don't worry, ma'am. They were
with the insurance company.

590
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,992
Stay down.

591
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,860
You're not supposed
to be out of bed.

592
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,005
You're not listening to the nurses.

593
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:56,282
Go check down there.

594
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:19,304
Hey, Marcus. Marcus.
You all right, buddy?

595
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:26,787
Hey, you hear me?

596
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,720
He's in the hallway.

597
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:42,002
Stab me once, shame on you.
Stab me twice...

598
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,334
... not gonna happen.

599
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,738
You're a hard man to get ahold of.

600
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,907
You have been giving Bill
and his boys fits.

601
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,610
Are you really that good?

602
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,517
Or is he that dumb?

603
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,429
And you must be the cousin.

604
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:12,527
Take this pretty little thing
out back.

605
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:17,396
-Show Bill how I care about his family.
-Get the fuck off me!

606
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:35,718
So that's it?
You're just gonna shoot me?

607
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,290
I always finish a job.

608
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,958
Be nice till it's time not to be nice.

609
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:21,193
Hey, thank you.
It's all right now.

610
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,204
That's for calling me a backstabber.

611
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,919
-You don't remember me, do you?
-Remember you?

612
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:43,788
You were a Louisiana state trooper,
a rookie.

613
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,291
You pulled me over in the interstate.

614
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,430
Took me in on marijuana
and cocaine possession.

615
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,965
Get that bitch up.

616
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,165
Get your fucking pants off.

617
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,037
You're next, Fidel.

618
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,109
The cops seized my house...

619
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,075
...took my Ferrari, my boat.

620
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,514
At the time, I thought
it was all your fault.

621
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,281
I took it personal
and wanted revenge.

622
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:19,958
Sorry about your father.

623
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:24,121
That was an unfortunate mistake.

624
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,594
I'm gonna get me some of that.

625
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:44,975
Bitch.

626
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,150
Bitch!

627
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:14,641
Oh, come on. I ain't finished yet,
Mr. Rookie Cop.

628
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,010
Bitch, you--

629
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,036
No!

630
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,689
Wait, wait. It wasn't me.
I didn't pull the trigger.

631
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,595
-Who did?
-Wild Bill.

632
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:04,554
He was working at the Pelican,
but he was also working for me.

633
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,235
-So I hired him to kill you.
-Where is he?

634
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,327
I don't know.

635
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,905
Wait! I got a deal going down
at Pelican tonight.

636
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:15,702
I'll cut you in, get you some cash.

637
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,073
Where is he?

638
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:24,978
All right, all right. Hospital.

639
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:44,799
Beau.

640
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,615
Gotta get to Nate.

641
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,014
-To the hospital.
-Okay.

642
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,723
Nurse!

643
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,623
We need some help in here!

644
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:24,136
Hey, hey.
Sorry, you can't go in right now.

645
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,989
Monyhan, how fast
can you get here?

646
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,571
Hold it right where you are.

647
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,079
How the hell
are we gonna get past him?

648
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,309
We're not.

649
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:40,351
The road's closed
for parish business.

650
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,327
How many more are gonna die...

651
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,997
...because you won't stand up
and do the right thing?

652
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:57,630
This is your town.
These are your people.

653
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,451
This deal is gonna take us to our next
level of expanding our operation.

654
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,518
Hey, man!

655
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:18,457
Hey, hey, last call!
Last call for alcohol!

656
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,458
-Bill.
-What do you think about my new bar?

657
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,961
-Well, it needs a little work.
-Well....

658
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:27,727
Wait, I thought Mr. Crost
was gonna join us.

659
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,564
Yeah, well, he....

660
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,206
That's probably him right now.

661
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:53,122
Go check it out. Go on, go on.

662
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:55,554
-Check it out.
-He's in there.

663
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,232
-He's in.
-He's inside.

664
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,570
Come on, bitch! I hate cops!

665
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,128
Get down!

666
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:34,086
I'm gonna kill you
just like I killed your father.

667
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,368
God!

668
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:38,350
Get the fuck off of me.

669
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:50,998
-Let see what's your insides look like.
-You fucking freak.

670
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,283
Never in my wildest dreams...

671
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:47,615
...did I think I'd get to kill the father,
the son, and the holy Nate.

672
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,462
I believe in you, boy. Come on.

673
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,018
This is for my uncle.

674
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,964
And this is for my father.

675
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:19,339
Antoine De Marco and Victor Crost.

676
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:23,006
I'd say this counts as the big one
Captain Stenton wanted.

677
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,685
Monyhan!

678
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,490
I'm gonna have your badge for this.
You done gone too damned far.

679
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,591
If I were you, I'll be getting
my lawyer on the phone.

680
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,921
What makes you think
I'm gonna need a lawyer?

681
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,152
So when are you heading
back north?

682
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,152
That's assuming
I'm heading back north.

683
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:11,924
Are you?

684
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,891
-That's a direct question.
-I'm a direct girl.

685
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,763
Yes, you are.

686
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:22,266
What would your uncle say if you
left a pretty young woman all alone?

687
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,968
He ain't going nowhere.

688
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,268
See, we got a lot
of catching up to do.

689
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,445
It's been a long, long time.

690
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,008
It's good to be home.

691
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,550
Go Chubby.

692
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,753
-Go Chubby.
-Go Chubby.

693
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,918
Where are those glasses?

694
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,754
-Here they are, boss.
-Thank you.

695
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,897
-How you doing, Larry?
-Good.

696
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,899
-Good?
-Yeah, I like it here.

697
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,162
Tough boss.
