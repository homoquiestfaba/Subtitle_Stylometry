ABOUT BEING A CHRISTIAN.

YOU'RE EITHER SAVED OR NOT.

70
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,959
ARE YOU BAPTIZED?

71

 WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW?

73
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,432

ABOUT IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

74

I WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER IT.

 I GUESS NOT.

88
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,426

89

93
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,635
 I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE RIVER.

94
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,638

95
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,008
GAVE ALL MY SINS TO JESUS

READ BOOKS IN GREEK

108

ALL THE TIME.

109
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,137

SEE ME DEAD THAN THAT WAY.

110
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,940
SHE SAID HE LIVED
A USELESS LIFE.

112

"LET THEM HEAR THE PRAYERS
OF A TRUE CHRISTIAN."

128
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,148
AND THEN I JUST PRAY
THAT MUCH LOUDER.

WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN A

00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:32,465
HAVE YOU?

177
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,466
 NO.

178
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,333
 YOU WANT ME TO PLAY
SOMETHING FOR YOU NOW?

179
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,135
 HONEY, YOUR BROTHER
JUST GOT HERE.

180
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,870
HE'S TIRED.

181
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:40,206
JUST LET HIM REST
FOR A WHILE FIRST.

182
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,808
NOW, WHAT TIME DID YOU
GET UP THIS MORNING?

183
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,809
 FOUR.

184
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,444
 MR. DAVENPORT'S UP AT FOUR
EVERY MORNING.

185
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,380
EVEN ON SUNDAYS,
ISN'T HE, MAMA?

186
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,514
 YES, HE IS.

187
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,984
HORACE, YOU'VE GROWN INTO
A NICE-LOOKING YOUNG MAN.

188
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,819
 THANK YOU.

189
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,989
 HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN
ON STAYING, BROTHER?

190
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,090
 OH, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

191
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,126
YOU MENTIONED A WEEK
IN YOUR LETTER, AND I THOUGHT--

192
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,395
 NOW, IF I FIXED YOU
A SANDWICH, WOULD YOU EAT IT?

193
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,429
 SURE.

194
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,097
 AND I HAVE A CAKE I MADE
JUST THIS MORNING.

195
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,365
WOULD YOU LIKE A PIECE
OF THAT, TOO?

196
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,299
 YES, MA'AM.

197
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,745
 ( chuckles )
THIS IS A TWO-STORY HOUSE.

198
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:27,219
WE RENT ONE OF THE UPSTAIRS
BEDROOMS TO A QUIET COUPLE.

199
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,088
 DO YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED?

200
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,023
 YES, YOU HAVE.

201
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,059
 WOULD YOU HAVE RECOGNIZED ME
IF YOU'D PASSED ME

202
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:33,793
ON THE STREET?

203
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,061
 I THINK SO.

204
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,230
 I KEEP HAVING THIS TERRIBLE
DREAM THAT I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED

205
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,800
AND THEY WON'T LET ME GO
UNTIL I'M AN OLD WOMAN.

206
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,169
AND WHEN I COME BACK HOME,
NO ONE RECOGNIZES ME.

207
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,137
AND I KEEP SAYING,
"I'M LILY DALE.

208
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,972
I'M LILY DALE ROBEDAUX."

209
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,476
BUT NO ONE BELIEVES ME.

210
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,978
YOU EVER HAVE A DREAM LIKE THAT?

211
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,347
 NO.

212
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,949
 YOU EVER HAVE DREAMS?

213
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,551
 SOMETIMES.

214
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,520
ONCE I DREAMED...

215
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:06,826
I FORGET. ( chuckles )
 WE DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE

216
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,360
COMING WHEN YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MOTHER'S LETTER.

217
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,529
 I DIDN'T GET THE LETTER
RIGHT AWAY, AND WHEN

218
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,032
I DID GET IT, I JUST DECIDED
TO COME ON.

219
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,234
 HOW MUCH DID IT
COST YOU TO GET HERE?

220
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,035
 TWO DOLLARS.

221
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,070
 WHERE'D YOU GET
THE TWO DOLLARS?

222
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,305
 MAMA SENT IT TO ME.

223
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,372
 SHE DID?

224
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,542
 MAMA SAID SHE'D GIVE ME
THE MONEY TO COME BACK

225
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,610
ONCE I GOT HERE.

226
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:29,348
 ( man shouting )
 MAMA, THE VEGETABLE MAN'S

227
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,382
OUT FRONT.

228
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,451
 I HEAR HIM, HONEY.

229
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,421
 HOW MUCH LONGER WILL
MR. DAVENPORT BE GONE?

230
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,390
 HE WAS TO BE GONE
THREE WEEKS, BUT WE GOT

231
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,493
A LETTER FROM HIM YESTERDAY
AND HE SAID THINGS HAD

232
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,995
CHANGED SO IN ATLANTA
THAT IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HOME

233
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,563
ANY LONGER AND HE LONGED
TO GET BACK TO US.

234
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,166
SO HE'S CUTTING HIS TRIP SHORT.

235
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,468
WHEN MAMA GOT THE LETTER,
SHE SAID IT WAS A BLESSING

236
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,636
YOU HADN'T COME.

237
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,172
SHE WOULD'VE BEEN A NERVOUS
WRECK, HAVING YOU HERE AND

238
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,208
EXPECTING MR. DAVENPORT TO
WALK IN ANY MINUTE UNEXPECTED.

239
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,477
YOU SEE, SHE SENT FOR YOU
BEHIND HIS BACK.

240
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,580
SHE KIND OF HINTED AROUND FOR
HIS PERMISSION TO HAVE YOU HERE

241
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,415
WHILE HE WAS GONE, BUT HE SAID
HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

242
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,417
A GOOD IDEA TO ENCOURAGE YOU
TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK.

243
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,387
SO SHE DIDN'T PRESS IT FURTHER,
BUT THEN SHE DECIDED

244
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,523
TO WRITE YOU ANYWAY,
WHICH, AT THE TIME,

245
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,124
I THOUGHT WAS A MISTAKE.

246
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,895
I ALWAYS THINK DECEIT
IS A MISTAKE, DON'T YOU?

247
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,165
MAMA, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU SENT BROTHER TWO DOLLARS

248
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,332
FOR A TRAIN TICKET?

249
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,635
 WELL, THAT WAS
JUST MY SECRET, HONEY.

250
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:28,340
WE'VE ALL GOT TO HAVE
OUR SECRETS, DON'T WE?

251
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,509
 CAN I PLAY MY ETUDE
FOR YOU NOW, BROTHER?

00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,644

00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,332
FOR ATLANTA.

347
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,807
 THIS IS THE RING
MY BOYFRIEND GAVE ME.

348
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,309
HE WANTS TO MARRY ME.

349
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,478
HE SAYS I'M BEAUTIFUL.

350
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,848
HE SAYS I'M PRETTY ENOUGH
TO BE AN ACTRESS.

351
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,883
HE'S VERY HANDSOME, TOO.

352
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,486
HE DOES DRINK, THOUGH,
AND HE SMOKES CIGARETTES,

353
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,855
BUT I TOLD HIM HE'D HAVE TO
STOP BOTH BEFORE I MARRIED HIM.

354
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,790
I TOLD HIM I HAD A FATHER
WHO WAS A DRUNKARD

355
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,725
AND A CIGARETTE FIEND
AND THAT THOSE HABITS

356
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,861
HAD KILLED HIM.

357
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,463
DO YOU REMEMBER PAPA?

358
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,298
 SURE.

359
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,667
 I DON'T HAVE A PICTURE
OF HIM, DO YOU?

360
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,668
 NO.

361
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,237
 I WONDER IF ANYONE
HAS A PICTURE OF HIM.

362
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,172
I TELL YOU, I CAN HARDLY
REMEMBER WHAT HE

363
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,807
LOOKS LIKE ANYMORE.

364
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,609
I CAN HEAR HIS VOICE, THOUGH.

365
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,945
I CAN REMEMBER THE WAY HE
ALWAYS USED TO CALL ME SISTER

366
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,546
AND YOU BROTHER.

367
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,782
 HE NEVER CALLED YOU SISTER
OR ME BROTHER.

368
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,783
 YES, HE DID.

369
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,851
 NO, HE DIDN'T.

370
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,220
HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HORACE JR.
AND YOU LILY DALE.

371
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,621
 WELL, THEN,
WHO CALLED ME SISTER

372
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,689
AND WHO CALLED YOU BROTHER?

373
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,257
 I CALLED YOU SISTER,
AND YOU CALLED ME BROTHER,

374
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,726
BUT PAPA--
 WHAT'S THAT?

375
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,661
 THIS IS PAPA'S WATCH.

376
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,596
IT DOESN'T RUN.

377
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,197
I'LL HAVE IT FIXED SOMEDAY.

378
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,199
LOOK, IT HAD HIS INITIALS
ENGRAVED, SEE?

379
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,200
 WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

380
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,201
 I FOUND IT STUFFED IN
A DRAWER AT THE HOUSE

381
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,638
WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER
YOU ALL LEFT THAT TIME.

382
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,641
AND LOOK.

383
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,909
THIS IS MAMA'S WEDDING RING.

384
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,810
 HOW DO YOU KNOW?

385
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,712
 LOOK INSIDE.

386
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:11,517
IT SAYS "TO C.T. FROM H.R."

387
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,853
 YES, IT DOES.

388
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,656
 I USED TO HAVE SOME
OF PAPA'S BOOKS.

389
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,857
 WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

390
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,958
 I DON'T KNOW.

391
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,461
THEY JUST DISAPPEARED AFTER
I WENT TO WORK OUT AT

392
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,697
THE GAUTIER PLANTATION.

393
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,934
I USED TO READ ALL THE TIME.

394
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,537
I READ NEWSPAPERS NOW MOSTLY.

395
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,339
 I CAN'T STAND READING.

396
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,275
MOTHER DOESN'T LIKE
TO READ EITHER.

397
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,344
MR. DAVENPORT SAYS HE'S NEVER
READ A BOOK IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE

398
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,546
AND HE DOESN'T INTEND TO.

399
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,348
AND ONCE WHEN MAMA TOLD HIM HOW
PAPA USED TO LIKE TO READ,

400
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,752
HE SAID, "NO WONDER HE DRANK."

401
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,554
LOOK, THIS IS MY SWEETHEART.

402
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,626
 ISN'T HE GOOD-LOOKING?

403
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,029
HE PLAYS BASEBALL
ON THE CITY TEAM.

404
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,330
HE'S A FIRST BASEMAN.

405
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,433
HE'S A WONDERFUL ATHLETE.

406
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,901
HE'S 25.

407
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,604
MR. DAVENPORT SAYS
HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY FATHER,

408
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,739
BUT I THINK A BOY SHOULD BE
QUITE A BIT OLDER THAN A GIRL,

409
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,874
DON'T YOU?

410
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,776
 OH, I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

411
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,044
 ARE YOU READY?

412
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,745
 WHAT ARE WE GONNA SEE?

413
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,681
 I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M SURE
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

414
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,516
IT ALWAYS IS.

415
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:23,989
 ( people chattering )
 ISN'T THIS EXCITING, BROTHER?

416
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,657
I LIKE MUSIC BEST.

417
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,026
WE CAME TO HEAR GALLI-CURCI
WHEN SHE SANG HERE,

418
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,395
AND PADEREWSKI
AND JOHN McCORMACK.

419
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,663
 I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE HEARD HIM.

420
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:32,898
I LOVE IRISH TENORS.

421
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,333
I HEARD CHAUNCEY OLCOTT.

422
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,737
 COME ALONG, CHILDREN,
WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS.

423
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,572
 DID JOHN McCORMACK
SING
MOTHER MACHREE?

424
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,740
 YES, HE DID.

425
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,809
 SO DID CHAUNCEY OLCOTT
AS AN ENCORE.

426
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,777
 WE HAVE A RECORDING OF
JOHN McCORMACK SINGING,

427
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,545
DON'T WE, SISTER?

428
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,913
 YES, WE DO.

429
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,555
 CORELLA!

430
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,696
 LILY DALE!

431
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,753
 ( applause )
 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CARED

432
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,558
FOR THE PLAY, BROTHER.

433
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,961
 YES, I DID,
WHAT I COULD UNDERSTAND.

434
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,630
 HE'S PROBABLY NEVER SEEN
A PLAY BY SHAKESPEARE BEFORE,

435
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,531
PRECIOUS.

436
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,033
IT CAN BE HARD TO
UNDERSTAND AT FIRST.

437
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,100
 YOU FELL ASLEEP TWICE.

438
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:47,939
ONCE YOU WERE SNORING SO LOUD,
I HAD TO POKE YOU.

439
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,041
 MAMA, WHAT DID PAPA CALL ME?

440
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,610
DID HE CALL ME SISTER
OR DID HE CALL ME LILY DALE?

441
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,744
 I DON'T REMEMBER.

442
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,447
 WELL, I THINK HE CALLED ME
SISTER, BUT BROTHER SAYS

443
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,581
HE CALLED ME LILY DALE.

444
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,050
 HE DID CALL YOU LILY DALE.

445
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,451
I REMEMBER NOW.

446
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,552
 ALL OF THE TIME?

447
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,722
 I EXPECT SO.

448
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,659
HE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD ALL
BE CALLED BY OUR GIVEN NAMES.

449
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,761
 HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN
YOU MARRIED OUR FATHER?

450
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,030
 ( chuckles ) OH, 18.

451
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:16,001
I HAD HORACE WHEN I WAS 19.

452
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,936
 HOW OLD WAS OUR FATHER?

453
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,939
 TWENTY-TWO.

454
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,810
WE WERE ALL MOVING AROUND
SO MUCH AFTER THE WAR.

455
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,480
WE LIVED IN GOLIAD,
SALURIE ISLAND,

456
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,716
THEN BACK TO HARRISON.

457
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,719
WELL, MY PAPA WANTED
TO GET BACK HIS LAND

458
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:38,156
HE FELT HIS PAPA HAD
BEEN CHEATED OUT OF.

459
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,992
I THINK YOUR DADDY'S PEOPLE
WERE ALREADY THERE BY THEN.

460
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,028
I'M SURE THEY WERE.

461
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,764
HIS BROTHERS RAN THE NEWSPAPER.

462
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,100
HE HAD A LAW OFFICE.

463
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,202
HE WAS VERY HANDSOME.

464
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,571
VERY DISTINGUISHED.

465
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,039
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN.

466
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,943
 ( both gasp )
 DON'T BE FRIGHTENED.

467
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:03,815
 ( both laugh )
 I DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU WERE

468
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:04,983
OR WHAT YOU WANTED.

469
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,652
 I DON'T REMEMBER BEING SO
FRIGHTENED IN ALL MY LIFE.

470
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,620
WHEN'D YOU GET HERE?

471
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,688
 I'VE BEEN HERE TWO HOURS.

472
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,022
TOOK A NAP.

473
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,857
 WE GOT YOUR LETTER.

474
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,658
WE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TILL TOMORROW.

475
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,027
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

476
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:16,995
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

477
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,764
I LEARNED TWO NEW PIECES
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

478
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,767
I JUST--
 PETE, HORACE SURPRISED US

479
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,802
BY JUST WALKING IN HERE
THIS MORNING.

480
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,038
HE TOOK A DAY OFF FROM WORK
AND DECIDED TO PAY US A VISIT.

481
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,809
 HELLO, SIR.

482
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,678
 HELLO.

483
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,247
 DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

484
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,082
 I GUESS SO.

485
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,952
 HOW WERE YOUR PEOPLE?

486
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,721
 ALL RIGHT.

487
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,095
 Lily Dale: OOH, HE IS MAD.

488
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,963
I'VE ONLY SEEN HIM MAD ONCE.

489
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,565
I HOPE NEVER TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

490
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,233
 HORACE.

491
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,868
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR YOU
HERE NOW.

492
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,570
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, HONEY?

493
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,705
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT TRAIN
BACK TO HARRISON TONIGHT.

494
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,373
YOU GO TO VIRGIE.

495
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,240
YOU TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED.

496
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,776
SHE'LL JUST LET YOU STAY
WITH HER, OKAY?

497
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,912
 I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
FOR THE TICKET HOME.

498
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:07,813
 OH, YEAH, I FORGOT.

499
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,747
I'M SO SORRY.

500
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,715
I HAVE SOME MONEY
UPSTAIRS IN MY CLOSET.

501
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:11,283
I'LL GO GET IT.

502
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,818
NOW YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE.

503
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,762
 HOW ARE ALL OUR OLD FRIENDS
BACK IN HARRISON?

504
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,967
 ALL RIGHT.

505
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,571
WILLIE ROSEBERRY LEFT.

506
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:09,040
 MAMA JUST WENT TO GET HIM
SOME MONEY TO GET BACK HOME ON.

507
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,575
SHE SENT HIM TWO DOLLARS
TO GET HERE.

508
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,177
 YOU'RE GIVING HIM MONEY?

509
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,948
 WELL, YOU SEE,
MR. DAVENPORT...

510
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:21,353
 YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

511
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,923
AREN'T YOU ASHAMED TO TAKE MONEY
FROM YOUR MAMA?

512
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,192
WELL, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I WAS SUPPORTING MY MOTHER,

513
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,693
BROTHER, AND SISTERS
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

514
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,230
NOBODY EVER GAVE ME ANYTHING.

515
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:36,935
WHAT KIND OF MAN YOU GONNA MAKE,
TAKING MONEY FROM A WOMAN

516
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,136
AT YOUR AGE?

517
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,378
 HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT, SON.

518
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,046
HE'S NOT AS BAD AS HE SOUNDS.

519
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,681

00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,971
 ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SON?

693
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,006
 I DON'T FEEL WELL, MAMA.

694
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,341
 OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE BURNING UP.

695
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,576
YOU DON'T HAVE MALARIA, DO YOU?

696
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:19,677
YOU BEEN TAKING THAT QUININE?

697
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,847
 YES, MA'AM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

698
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,248
 ( gasps )
HORACE!

699
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,850
 ( gasps )
 MR. DAVENPORT!

700
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,884
MR. DAVENPORT, IT'S HORACE!

701
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:27,752
HE'S FAINTED!

702
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:28,920
HERE, HELP ME WITH HIM.

703
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,454
 HE'S GONNA DIE!

704
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,422
I KNOW HE'S GONNA DIE!

705
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,457
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER
OF MY TERRIBLE DREAMS.

706
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,593
I'M ALWAYS SEEING
BROTHER DEAD IN HIS COFFIN.

707
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,862
SOMETIMES HE'S BEEN IN
A TERRIBLE TRAIN WRECK.

708
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,565
SOMETIMES--
 LILY DALE, HUSH!

709
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,567
 HE'S NOT GONNA DIE.

710
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,701
 HE'S GOT A TERRIBLE FEVER.

711
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,002
FEEL HIS FOREHEAD.

712
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,338
HE'S BURNING UP.

713
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,706
 YES, HE DOES.

714
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,708
 OH, GOD, YOU SUPPOSE
HE HAS MALARIA?

715
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,310
IT'S JUST RIFE DOWN HOME.

716
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,278
 I DON'T KNOW A THING
ABOUT MALARIA.

717
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,813
I'M NOT FROM THE SWAMPS
OR THE BOTTOMS.

718
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,882
I'M FROM ATLANTA, REMEMBER?

719
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,750
THE FINEST CLIMATE
IN THE WORLD.

720
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,820
 WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT
IF HE STAYS HERE TONIGHT?

721
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,289
 WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO?

722
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,024
JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T
LOSE HIS JOB TRAMPING

723
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,025
AROUND THE COUNTRY LIKE THIS.

724
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,494
 HE WAS GONNA QUIT HIS JOB.

725
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,998
HE SAID HE THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD FIND HIM A JOB

726
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:14,799
WORKING AT THE RAILROAD YARD.

727
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:17,501
 HE BETTER NOT
ASK ME FOR A JOB.

728
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,070
LET HIM FIND HIS OWN JOB.

729
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,771
NOBODY EVER GAVE ME A JOB.

730
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:22,306
I NEVER ASKED ANYBODY
FOR ANYTHING.

731
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,008
NOT ONE SOLITARY THING.

732
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:34,285
I HAVE TOO MUCH PRIDE
TO ASK HELP OF ANYONE.

733
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:41,759

WELCOME BACK TO THE LAND
OF THE LIVING.

771
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,881
 THANK YOU.

772
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,184
 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN A WHOLE WEEK YOU'VE

773
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,686
EVEN RESPONDED TO US AT ALL.

774
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,922
WE WERE SO AFRAID
FOR YOU, BROTHER.

775
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,925
WE THOUGHT WE WERE
GONNA LOSE YOU.

776
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,892
 WAS I SICK?

777
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,726
 SICK?

778
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,729
I GUESS YOU WERE SICK.

779
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,899
AT THE POINT OF DEATH
FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS.

780
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,134
OUT OF YOUR HEAD
THE WHOLE TIME.

781
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,703
TALKING THE WILDEST
KIND OF NONSENSE.

782
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,706
YOU THOUGHT MR. DAVENPORT
HAD A BUTCHER KNIFE AND WAS

783
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,841
TRYING TO KILL YOU.

784
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,576
"HE'S TRYING TO SLIT MY THROAT!

785
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,744
PLEASE DON'T LET HIM
SLIT MY THROAT!"

786
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,013
I TELL YOU, IT WAS AWFUL.

787
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,815
THERE'S GOOD
COME FROM IT, THOUGH.

788
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,616
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

789
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,751
THE NEXT NIGHT,
WILL CAME TO CALL

790
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,154
AND HE MADE HIMSELF SO HELPFUL
THAT MAMA AND MR. DAVENPORT

791
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,022
FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
AND HE'S BEEN INVITED OVER

792
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,557
EVERY NIGHT FOR SUPPER.

793
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,659
AND WHEN MR. DAVENPORT
FOUND OUT THAT WILL HAD

794
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,595
LOST HIS JOB, HE TOOK HIM
DOWN TO THE RAILROAD YARD

795
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,330
AND GOT HIM A JOB
WORKING THERE.

796
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,898
ISN'T THAT THRILLING?

797
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,999
 WHERE AM I?

798
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,200
 WHAT, BROTHER?

799
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,035
 WHERE AM I?

800
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,637
 WHERE ARE YOU?

801
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,038
HEAVENS, BROTHER.

802
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,206
DON'T SCARE ME THAT WAY.

803
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,808
YOU'RE IN HOUSTON.

804
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,576
DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

805
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,811
 HOW DID I GET HERE?

806
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,346
 HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

807
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,648
ON THE TRAIN.

808
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,783
 HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE?

809
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:00,784
 TWO WEEKS.

810
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,786
YOU'VE BEEN SICK
THE WHOLE TIME.

811
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,921
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

812
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,323
I HAD TO GO TO MY GIRLFRIEND'S
TO PRACTICE MY MUSIC.

813
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,058
 HAVE I BEEN BAPTIZED?

814
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,059
 WHAT, HONEY?

815
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,027
 HAVE I BEEN BAPTIZED?

816
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:10,928
 BROTHER, I DON'T KNOW.

817
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,196
 HAVE YOU BEEN BAPTIZED?

818
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,931
 I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER.

819
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,866
WHAT MAKES YOU ASK
A QUESTION LIKE THAT

820
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,068

821
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,670
 IS MAMA HERE?

822
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,671
 NO.

823
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,805
SHE WENT TO THE STORE.

824
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,674
SHE'S MAKING ME A BALL GOWN.

825
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,077
WILL'S TAKING ME TO

826

827
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:34,351

866
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,132
 WELL, YOU DIDN'T DIE.

867
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,000
 WAS I BAPTIZED, MAMA?

868
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,802
 NO.

869
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,905
 HOW COME WE WEREN'T BAPTIZED?

870
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,073
 WELL...

871
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,375
EVERY TIME I STARTED TO GET
YOU BAPTIZED WHEN YOU WERE

872
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,845
A BABY, SOMETHING PREVENTED ME
FROM DOING IT.

873
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,215
I MEAN, I GOT SICK,
YOU GOT SICK, YOUR FATHER...

874
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,951
THEN ALL OUR
TROUBLES STARTED.

875
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:52,056
I JUST NEVER GOT
AROUND TO IT.

876
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,758
 WELL, LOOK WHO'S HOME.

877
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,360
 HOW DOES THE YOUNG MAN FEEL?

878
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,296
 I THINK HE'S GONNA LIVE NOW.

879
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,098
 HE'S STRONG AS AN OX.

880
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,933
DID YOU TELL HIM HOW I HAD
TO WRESTLE WITH HIM TO KEEP HIM

881
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,001
ON THAT BED?

882
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,803
HE THOUGHT THAT PETE HERE
WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM.

883
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:06,937
 HOW WAS WORK?

884
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,604
 FINE.

885
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,772
I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY DAY.

886
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,340
I THINK THEY LIKE ME, TOO.

887
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,175
DON'T THEY, PETE?

888
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,443
 OH, YES, THEY DO.

889
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,512
THEY SAID TODAY YOU'RE AS GOOD
A WORKER AS THEY'VE EVER SEEN.

890
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,248
 OH, LILY DALE,
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW WILL

891
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:22,953
THE FABRIC I GOT FOR YOUR DRESS?

892
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,321
 THAT IS MIGHTY GOOD-LOOKING.

893
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,356
I'M GONNA HAVE THE PRETTIEST
AND BEST-DRESSED GIRL

894
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,491
AT THE BALL.

895
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:28,225
 SEE IT, PETE?

896
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,460
ISN'T IT PRETTY?

897
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,128
 IT SURE IS.

898
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,964
 YOUNG MAN, YOU'D BETTER GET
WELL AND COME GO WITH US.

899
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,299
 I'M GOING BACK TOMORROW.

900
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,267
 NO, SON.

901
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:38,335
 NO, I'M GOING TO.

902
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,571
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA GET
DRESSED AND GET BAPTIZED.

903
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:41,972
I'M GONNA FIND ME A PREACHER.

904
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,007
I'M DIRTY, AND I WANNA BE
WASHED CLEAN.

905
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,909
 HE'S DELIRIOUS AGAIN.

906
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:46,477
 COME ON, FELLA.

907
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,045
 DON'T COME NEAR ME!

908
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,046
DON'T COME NEAR ME!

909
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,883
YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME
BEFORE I GET BAPTIZED!

910
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,586
 I THINK HE'S PUTTING ON
AN ACT JUST TO GET US

911
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,155
TO KEEP HIM HERE
SO HE CAN GET FREE ROOM

912
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:58,856
AND BOARD.

913
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,958
 WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT?

914
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,293
HE'S SICK,
AND YOU KNOW HE'S SICK.

915
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:13,337
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF, PETE.

916
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,974
 DOES HE KNOW HE LOST
HIS JOB IN GLEN FLORA?

917
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:20,477
 HE DIDN'T LOSE HIS JOB,
JUST LAID OFF TEMPORARILY.

918
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,578
 WHAT ABOUT MY JOB?

919
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,081
 SHH, IT'S OKAY.

920
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,016
DON'T GET EXCITED.

921
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,017
JUST HUSH.

922
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:27,885
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

923
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,219
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
ANOTHER TIME.

924
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,053
 WHAT ABOUT MY JOB, MAMA?

925
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,989
DON'T I HAVE MY JOB
IN GLEN FLORA?

926
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,324
 BROTHER, THERE'S BEEN A
TERRIBLE FIRE IN GLEN FLORA.

927
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,960
MR. GALBRAITH'S STORE
BURNED DOWN.

928
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,428
 OH, MY GOD.

929
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:44,501
 MR. GALBRAITH SENT WORD
HE IS GONNA REBUILD HIS STORE,

930
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:48,972
AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA GET
YOUR OLD JOB BACK THEN.

931
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,374
OKAY?

932
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,876
NOW YOU JUST REST, HONEY.

933
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,170
 THERE, TAKE THE DRESS
TO YOUR ROOM.

934
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,039
CAREFUL YOU DON'T WRINKLE IT.

935
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,607
 THANK YOU.

936
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,818
 Pete: WHERE'S LILY DALE?

937
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,554
 SHE'S UPSTAIRS IN HER ROOM,
GETTING DRESSED FOR THE DANCE.

938
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,923
 CALL ME WHEN
SHE'S ALL DRESSED.

939
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,658
 I WILL.

940
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,378
 WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO
ASK YOU HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

941
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,680
ONE LOOK AT YOU TELLS ME
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER.

942
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,249
 I AM, THANK YOU.

943
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,150
WHO BROUGHT ME THE PAPERS?

944
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,318
 WILL DID.

945
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,586
I ASKED HIM TO.

946
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,321
I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

947
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,723
 OH, YES, I LIKE THEM.

948
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,091
 HE ASKED ME WHAT YOU WANTED.

949
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,459
I SAID, "OH, ANYTHING
FROM OUT OF TOWN."

950
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,460
WHAT'D HE GET?

951
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,228
 NEW ORLEANS PICAYUNE,
ST. LOUIS STAR,

952
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,963
AND THE
GALVESTON NEWS.

953
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,331
GALVESTON NEWS?

954
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,733
THAT'S NOT VERY FAR AWAY.

955
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,734
 I KNOW, BUT I LIKE IT.

956
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,402
IT'S MY FAVORITE PAPER.

957
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,570
 IS THAT SO?

958
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,706
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ONE
FROM THE OTHER.

959
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,175
I NEVER READ THE PAPER.

960
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,344
IT'S MY EYES, I GUESS.

961
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,713
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
MY EYES ARE SO TIRED

962
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,449
FROM ALL THAT SEWING.

963
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:43,754
HORACE, DO YOU REMEMBER
MRS. CLINT HARRIS?

964
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,088
 NO, MA'AM.

965
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,757
 OH, SURE, YOU DO.

966
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,058
SHE'S KIN TO THE VAUGHNS.

967
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,626
WELL, MRS. VAUGHN, I GUESS.

968
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,696
YEAH, SHE AND I WERE
FRIENDS BACK IN HARRISON

969
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,532
BEFORE I LEFT TO MARRY
MR. DAVENPORT.

970
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:59,403
WELL, MYRTLE HARRIS LIVES
IN THAT HOUSE ACROSS

971
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,637
THE STREET--
THE ONE WITH THE BIG

972
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,172
STONE LIONS IN FRONT.

973
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:05,242
COST ALL KINDS OF MONEY,
THEY SAY.

974
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,378
SO WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE,
SHE CAME CALLING ON ME

975
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,014
AND I NEVER RETURNED THE CALL
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS WORKING.

976
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:15,719
SO VIRGIE WRITES ME THAT
MYRTLE HARRIS GOES TO HARRISON.

977
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,122
AND SHE TELLS VIRGIE THAT
I HAD HURT HER FEELINGS

978
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,658
BECAUSE I HAD NEVER
RETURNED THE CALL.

979
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,560
SO VIRGIE SAYS, "OH,
I'M SURE IT'S BECAUSE

980
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,594
SHE'S ALWAYS WORKING."

981
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,029
"OH," SAYS MYRTLE.

982
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,332
"WHAT DOES SHE DO?"
"WELL," SAYS VIRGIE,

983
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,100
"SHE TAKES IN SEWING."

984
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:34,304
"OH, WELL, HEAVENS,"
SAYS MYRTLE HARRIS.

985
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,606
"OH, HEAVENS WHAT?"
SAYS VIRGIE.

986
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,476
"SHE'S JUST AS POOR AS YOU
WERE WHEN YOU LIVED HERE.

987
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,611
SHE JUST DIDN'T MARRY
A RICH HUSBAND."

988
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:48,418
( laughs )
VIRGIE SAID THAT SHUT HER UP.

989
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,488
WHY DO YOU LIKE THIS
GALVESTON PAPER SO MUCH?

990
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,389
 I DON'T KNOW.

991
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,757
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
GALVESTON, YOU KNOW.

992
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,727
 NO, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

993
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,729
 OH, YEAH.

994
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,165
PAPA USED TO TALK
ABOUT IT SOMETIMES.

995
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,067
YOU KNOW, WHEN HE WAS
GROWING UP THERE AS A BOY.

996
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:08,739
 OH, HONEY, HE DIDN'T
GROW UP THERE.

997
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,542
NO, HE WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD
WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER

998
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,444
AND HIS DADDY WAS KILLED.

999
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,481
AND HE AND HIS MAMA HAD TO
GO TO TYLER AND START

1000
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,284
THAT BOARDINGHOUSE.

1001
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,854
 MAMA, WILL KIDDER TELLS ME
THAT FOR 50 DOLLARS,

1002
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:26,223
YOU CAN GO TO A BUSINESS SCHOOL
HERE IN HOUSTON.

1003
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,091
I THINK I'M GONNA DO IT.

1004
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,565
 WHERE WOULD YOU STAY?

1005
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,602
 WELL--
 HONEY...

1006
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:42,205
I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN
TO ASK YOU TO STAY HERE,

1007
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,707
BUT I CAN'T.

1008
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,276
YOU UNDERSTAND.

1009
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,445
THERE'S NO ROOM.

1010
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,514
WE MADE ROOM
WHILE YOU WERE SICK.

1011
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,314
 I KNOW.

1012
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,651
I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO STAY HERE.

1013
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:57,354
 WELL, WHERE WOULD YOU GET
THE MONEY TO PAY FOR ALL THIS?

1014
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,688
 I'LL TRY AND BORROW IT.

1015
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,589
 I CAN'T HELP YOU, SON.

1016
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:00,290
YOU UNDERSTAND.

1017
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,326
 I WASN'T GONNA ASK YOU, MAMA.

1018
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,762
 WELL, WHERE WOULD YOU
GET THE MONEY?

1019
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,365
 I THOUGHT I'D ASK AUNT VIRGIE
OR TRY THE BANK.

1020
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,167
 WELL, WHAT IF YOU
COULDN'T BORROW IT?

1021
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,269
 THEN I CAN'T GO.

1022
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,505
 WHY DO YOU WANNA STUDY
SO MUCH, SON?

1023
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:20,544
 I DON'T WANNA CLERK IN 
A DRY GOODS STORE ALL MY LIFE.

1024
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,779
I THOUGHT IF I HAD A
BUSINESS COURSE, I MIGHT HAVE

1025
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,514
A FEW MORE OPPORTUNITIES.

1026
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:27,651
 I SEE.

1027
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:32,823
WELL...

1028
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,660
I COULD DO THIS MUCH.

1029
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,330
I COULD MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
A GOOD BREAKFAST EVERY DAY.

1030
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:44,868
MR. DAVENPORT GOES
TO WORK ABOUT 5:00, 5:30.

1031
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:48,405
AND IF YOU CAME HERE
ABOUT 6:00, 6:30,

1032
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,942
I'LL MAKE SURE YOU HAD
A GOOD, HOT BREAKFAST.

1033
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:55,378
YOU HAVE A GIRL, SON?

1034
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,281
 I GO WITH SEVERAL.

1035
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,850
 NO PARTICULAR ONE?

1036
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:03,620
 I'VE BEEN SEEING QUITE A BIT
OF DOLLY PARKER.

1037
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,689
SHE LIVES AT THE GARRETTS'.

1038
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,557
THEY HAVE A PIANO,
AND THERE'S ALWAYS

1039
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:08,925
LOTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE
OVER THERE.

1040
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,961
ROSA GARRETT HAS A LOVELY VOICE.

1041
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,431
 IS DOLLY PRETTY, HONEY?

1042
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,932
 YES, MA'AM, SHE'S PRETTY.

1043
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,367
 AND ROSA?

1044
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,303
 WELL, ROSA HAS
A VERY NICE DISPOSITION.

1045
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,973
AND LIKE I SAY,
HER MOTHER AND FATHER ARE ALWAYS

1046
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,275
VERY KIND AND HOSPITABLE.

1047
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,977
 THEY STILL AS POOR
AS CHURCH MICE?

1048
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,247
 YES, MA'AM, I GUESS SO,
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A HAM

1049
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,516
OR A CHICKEN OR A TURKEY
ON THE TABLE.

1050
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,851
SOMETIMES THEY INVITE
AS MANY AS 12 OR 14 OF US

1051
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,086
TO STAY FOR DINNER.

1052
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,788
 I GUESS YOU'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED SOON,

1053
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,990
WON'T YOU?

1054
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,858
 I SUPPOSE SO.

1055
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,426
 WELL, YOU BEEN
THINKING ABOUT IT?

1056
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,862
 MAMA, I CAN'T THINK
OF GETTING MARRIED.

1057
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,464
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

1058
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,968
 I THINK THAT'S VERY
SENSIBLE OF YOU.

1059
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,438
I WISH I'D BEEN AS SENSIBLE AS
THAT WHEN I MARRIED YOUR FATHER.

1060
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,475
I HOPE YOUR SISTER WILL BE.

1061
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:02,746
OH. OH.

1062
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:03,947
 HOW DO I LOOK?

1063
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,950
 JUST BEAUTIFUL,
LIKE A PICTURE.

1064
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,585
 HOW DO I LOOK, BROTHER?

1065
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:09,853
 VERY PRETTY, SISTER.

1066
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,855
 THANK YOU.

1067
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:13,590
I FEEL PRETTY.

1068
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,626
I THOUGHT THAT JUST NOW AS I
LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

1069
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,829
NOT A GIRL AT THAT BALL,
I DON'T CARE HOW RICH THEY ARE,

1070
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,865
WILL HAVE A DRESS
AS PRETTY AS MINE.

1071
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:22,732
THANK YOU.

1072
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,768
 OH, SUGAR.

1073
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,802
 WHERE'S MR. DAVENPORT?

1074
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,037
I WANT HIM TO SEE ME.

1075
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,272
 WELL, HE'S OUT IN THE GARDEN.

1076
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:30,307
I'LL GO GET HIM.

1077
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,345
 LILY DALE'S ALL DRESSED NOW.

1078
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,047
SHE WANTS YOU TO
COME IN AND SEE HER.

1079
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,847
 I'M ALMOST DONE.

1080
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,482
IF YOU COULD HOLD
THAT LANTERN UP,

1081
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:43,587
I COULD SEE BETTER
WHAT I'M DOING.

1082
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:49,626
 I WAS THINKING, LYING ON THE
COUCH HERE THIS AFTERNOON...

1083
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:54,664
LILY DALE,
PAPA USED TO SING A SONG

1084
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,434
TO THE TWO OF US
CALLED
LILY DALE.

1085
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,502
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW IT WENT?

1086
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:03,840
 NO, AND I DON'T WANT TO.

1087
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:07,377
YOU ALWAYS WANNA
TALK ABOUT THE PAST.

1088
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,878
THAT'S WHY I LOVE WILL.

1089
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,680
HE ONLY WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT THE FUTURE, WHAT HE'S

1090
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,983
GONNA DO WITH HIS LIFE,
HOW MUCH HE'S GONNA ACCOMPLISH.

1091
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,752
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WANNA
TALK ABOUT THE PAST?

1092
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,087
WHAT PAPA DID OR DIDN'T DO?

1093
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,822
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE CALLED ME.

1094
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,791
ALL I KNOW IS HE SMOKED
CIGARETTES LIKE A FIEND

1095
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,893
AND WAS A DRUNKARD
AND BROKE MY MOTHER'S HEART

1096
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,763
AND DIED AND LEFT HER PENNILESS
TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD TO WORK

1097
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:27,831
TO SUPPORT TWO CHILDREN.

1098
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:32,702
 NO ONE'S SUPPORTED ME
SINCE I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.

1099
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,704
 WELL, SHE SUPPORTED ME.

1100
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,706
AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE
I WANNA TALK ABOUT,

1101
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,075
EXCEPT MR. DAVENPORT, WHO'S BEEN
MORE TO ME THAN A REAL FATHER

1102
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,813
COULD HAVE BEEN.

1103
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,950
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

1104
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:50,987
WHY HAVE YOU TURNED
YOUR FACE AWAY?

1105
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:53,657
BROTHER, ARE YOU GONNA LIE THERE
FOREVER ON THAT COUCH?

1106
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,459
YOU SHOULD MAKE YOURSELF
GET DRESSED NOW EVERY DAY

1107
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,996
AND START WALKING
AROUND THE BLOCK AT LEAST.

1108
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,632
WHY ARE YOU SO SAD, BROTHER?

1109
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,834
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO SAD?

1110
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,137
IT'S NOT FAIR.

1111
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,974
TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT ME.

1112
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,376
I CAN'T HELP IT IF I HAVE
A HAPPY DISPOSITION

1113
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,612
AND YOU DON'T.

1114
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:17,814
BROTHER, I WANNA BE CLOSE.

1115
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:20,483
LET'S BE CLOSE, PLEASE.

1116
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,485
WE'RE NOT CLOSE AS A
BROTHER AND SISTER SHOULD BE.

1117
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,087
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME TO YOU
WITH MY TROUBLES,

1118
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,023
AND I CAN'T.

1119
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,426
 SISTER, I FEEL CLOSE TO YOU.

1120
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:30,827
 DO YOU?

1121
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,495
 YES.

1122
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,130
 AND YOU'RE NOT JEALOUS OF ME?

1123
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,499
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1124
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:41,638
I'VE NEVER BEEN JEALOUS OF YOU
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

1125
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:45,175
 I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT.

1126
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:49,679
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JEALOUS OF ME
BECAUSE MR. DAVENPORT SPOILS ME

1127
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,981
AND PREFERS ME TO YOU,
BUT THAT'S ONLY NATURAL,

1128
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,183
BROTHER, THAT HE WOULD.

1129
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,452
YOU'RE A STRANGER TO HIM,
REALLY, AND I WAS RAISED UP HERE

1130
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,053
IN THE HOUSE WITH HIM.

1131
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,790
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN SO SWEET
AND CONSIDERATE TO ME, BROTHER.

1132
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,626
I REMEMBER WHEN MAMA
DECIDED TO MARRY HIM.

1133
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,629
HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS, AND HE
TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA BE

1134
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:07,697
A DADDY TO ME.

1135
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,532
AND HE HAS.

1136
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,668
HE CERTAINLY HAS.

1137
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,504
YOU MUST LOVE HIM FOR THAT.

1138
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,039
SAY YOU DO.

1139
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,808
 I CAN'T STAND HIM.

1140
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:19,943
 DON'T SAY THAT.

1141
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:24,948
 DO YOU THINK I'M FAKING
LYING HERE ON THIS COUCH?

1142
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,785
DO YOU THINK I DON'T CHOKE ON
EVERY PIECE OF HIS FOOD

1143
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:29,819
THAT I EAT?

1144
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:35,892
HOW CAN I GET WELL EATING
THE FOOD OF A MAN...

1145
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,627
I DESPISE?

1146
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,162
 BROTHER, BROTHER, STOP IT.

1147
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,565
 I DESPISE HIM.

1148
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,236
I WOULD NEVER HAVE COME HERE
IF I WOULD'VE THOUGHT

1149
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,705
HE WOULD COME HERE
AND I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN SICK

1150
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:49,973
AND BEEN AT HIS MERCY!

1151
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,141
 STOP IT.

1152
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:52,809
 I DESPISE HIM!

1153
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,677
I DESPISE HIM!

1154
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,014
IF I HAD THE STRENGTH,
I WOULD GET UP AND WALK ACROSS

1155
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,818
THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW--
 NOW YOU'VE SPOILED IT FOR ME.

1156
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:04,187
 RIGHT NOW.

1157
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,523
 TELL LILY DALE
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

1158
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,891
 ALL RIGHT.

1159
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,005
 HORACE!

1160
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,606
HORACE!

1161
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,809
HORACE!

1162
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,210
LILY DALE!

1163
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,112
LILY DALE!

1164
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,781
LILY DALE, GET MR. DAVENPORT,
QUICK, OUT IN THE YARD.

1165
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,983
YOUR BROTHER HAS FALLEN,
AND HE'S HURT! HURRY!

1166
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,287
AND GET THOSE SMELLING SALTS!

1167
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,789
 PETE, MAMA NEEDS YOU.

1168
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,125
BROTHER'S FAINTED AGAIN.

1169
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,594
 WHAT?

1170
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,568
 WHAT'S HAPPENED NOW?

1171
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:52,535
 I DON'T KNOW.

1172
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,872
I CAME IN AND JUST FOUND HIM
ON THE FLOOR.

1173
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,807
HERE.

1174
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,617
 I DESPISE HIM.

1175
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,184
 WHAT?

1176
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,219
 I DESPISE HIM.

1177
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,119
 HE'S DELIRIOUS.

1178
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:10,987
 I DESPISE HIM.

1179
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,222
 YOU DELIRIOUS, BOY?

1180
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,857
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, SON?

1181
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,692
 PETE. MR. DAVENPORT.

1182
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:16,926
HE SAYS HE HATES
AND DESPISES HIM.

1183
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,162
 SHH, DON'T SAY THAT.

1184
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,230
HE DOESN'T MEAN THAT. NEVER.

1185
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,131
DON'T REPEAT SOMETHING
SOMEONE SAYS WHEN THEY'RE

1186
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:22,832
OUT OF THEIR MIND.

1187
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:25,268
 HE WAS NOT OUT OF HIS MIND.

1188
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:29,205
HE'S RUINED THIS NIGHT FOR ME
BY HIS HATE!

1189
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,674
 YOU WERE OUT OF YOUR HEAD,
WEREN'T YOU, HONEY?

1190
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,109
DON'T RUIN THIS EVENING
FOR HER.

1191
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,078
SHE'S HAD SO LITTLE
HAPPINESS IN HER LIFE.

1192
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:36,112
 ( knock at door )
 HELLO THERE, YOUNG LADY.

1193
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:44,821
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1194
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:45,922
 WILL, COME ON AND HELP ME.

1195
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:46,789
HORACE HAS FALLEN.

1196
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,157
I NEED TO GET HIM
BACK ON THE COUCH.

1197
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,792
COME ON.

1198
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,160
 COME ON, BOY.

1199
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,128
COME ON.

1200
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,665
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

1201
00:58:55,698 --> 00:59:00,603
 THERE. THERE. THERE.

1202
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,906
NOW...

1203
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,707
YOU FEELING BETTER, HONEY?

1204
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:05,909
 YES, MA'AM.

1205
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,810
 YOU GAVE US QUITE A SCARE.

1206
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,078
YOU WERE DELIRIOUS.

1207
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:12,916
YOU KEPT LOOKING AT MR.DAVENPORT
AND SAYING HOW YOU DESPISED HIM.

1208
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,719
BUT HE KNEW YOU WERE DELIRIOUS
AND DIDN'T MEAN A WORD OF IT.

1209
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:19,255
( sighs )
 WHERE'S MY GIRL?

1210
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,957
I THOUGHT SHE'D BE
ALL DRESSED AND WAITING.

1211
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:25,028
 WELL, SHE WAS,
BUT HER BROTHER FELL DOWN

1212
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,797
AND SHE GOT ALL NERVOUS
AND UPSET AND JUST RAN

1213
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,698
OUT OF THE ROOM.

1214
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,999
I'LL GO GET HER.

1215
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,176
 DID LILY DALE TELL YOU
ABOUT MY NEW JOB?

1216
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,078
I'M LEAVING THE RAILROAD.

1217
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:44,047
I'M GOING INTO THE
PRODUCE BUSINESS.

1218
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,015
GREAT NEW COMPANY
THAT'S JUST STARTED UP.

1219
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:47,850
THEY GOT THE RIGHTS TO HANDLE
SOME GREAT NEW PRODUCTS

1220
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,118
HERE IN THIS AREA.

1221
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,920
ADMIRATION COFFEE...

1222
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,855
THAT'S THE ONE THEY
ADVERTISE AS "THE CUP

1223
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,424
OF SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY."

1224
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,125
AND, UH...

1225
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,261
HEY, SAY, YOU NEED A JOB.

1226
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,896
SPEAK TO PETE ABOUT GETTING
MY JOB FOR YOU OUT AT

1227
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,863
THE RAILROADS.

1228
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,865
ANYONE CAN DO IT.

1229
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,734
 LILY DALE WILL BE DOWN
IN A MINUTE.

1230
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,169
 PLENTY OF TIME, PETE.

1231
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,170
PLENTY OF TIME.

1232
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,838
SAY, I JUST HAD A GREAT IDEA.

1233
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,009
WHAT ABOUT HORACE FOR MY JOB
AT THE YARDS?

1234
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,144
 NO, IT WAS ALREADY TAKEN.

1235
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,779
IT WAS FILLED THIS AFTERNOON.

1236
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,148
 OH, WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

1237
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,050
WE JUST WEREN'T ON THE BALL,
WERE WE, PETE?

1238
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:25,888
WHY DIDN'T WE THINK
ABOUT IT SOONER?

1239
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:30,059
SAY, LOOK HERE.

1240
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:34,030
THIS SIGHT WAS
WORTH WAITING FOR.

1241
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,766
MY, MY.

1242
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,801
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

1243
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,203
 THANK YOU, WILL.

1244
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,771
MAMA MADE THE DRESS.

1245
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,439
 AND IT IS SOMETHING.

1246
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,841
YES, IT IS.

1247
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,276
DOESN'T SHE LOOK GORGEOUS, PETE?

1248
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,045
 YES, SHE DOES.

1249
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:50,480
 SHOOT, SHE'LL BE THE
PRETTIEST GIRL THERE,

1250
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,414
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

1251
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,484
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
YOUR SISTER, HORACE?

1252
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,585
PUT A WALTZ ON
THE VICTROLA, PETE.

1253
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,754
LILY DALE AND I WILL SHOW YOU
THE TEXAS CASTLES--

1254
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,055
IRENE AND VERNON.

1255
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,223
 I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT, WILL.

1256
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,124
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

1257
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,091
 A HEADACHE?

1258
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:02,959
WELL, GET OVER IT.

1259
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,894
NO HEADACHES ARE ALLOWED
ON THIS NIGHT.

1260
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:08,264
WE'RE GONNA DANCE ALL NIGHT.

1261
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:11,734
 ♪♪
 HOW IS THAT?

1262
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,008
 YOU DO MAKE
A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE.

1263
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,944
AND YOU'RE BOTH
WONDERFUL DANCERS.

1264
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,514
NOW, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
BRING HER HOME?

1265
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,449
 DON'T WAIT UP FOR US.

1266
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:29,085
 OH, I ALWAYS DO.

1267
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,821
I DON'T SHUT MY EYES
UNTIL SHE'S HOME.

1268
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,456
 DON'T YOU TRUST ME, LADY?

1269
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,025
DON'T YOU TRUST ME TO
TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAUGHTER?

1270
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:36,793
 I TRUST YOU, WILL.

1271
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,760
YOU KNOW THAT.

1272
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,929
 THEN YOU GO TO SLEEP.

1273
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,933
 NO, I DON'T SHUT MY EYES
UNTIL SHE'S IN THE HOUSE.

1274
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,768
 WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN SHE'S MARRIED AND

1275
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:46,469
NOT LIVING HERE ANYMORE?

1276
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,303
 THEN I CAN'T HELP IT.

1277
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,205
SHE'S SOMEONE ELSE'S
RESPONSIBILITY.

1278
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,873
 WHAT IF WE'RE OUT UNTIL DAWN?

1279
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:52,809
 THEN I WON'T SLEEP
UNTIL DAWN.

1280
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,510
YOU'RE TEASING ABOUT DAWN.

1281
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,412
YOU'LL BRING HER HOME BY 12:00.

1282
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,213
 OR ONE.

1283
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,415
 TWELVE.

1284
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,151
 ALL RIGHT, 12:30.

1285
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,921
LET'S GO, PRINCESS.

1286
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:09,792
 NOW, HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME,
BOTH OF YOU.

1287
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,294
THERE.

1288
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,395
 THANK YOU, MAMA.

1289
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:14,063
 GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

1290
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:14,931
 GOOD NIGHT, PETE.

1291
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:16,132
 GOOD NIGHT, HON.

1292
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:16,833
 GOOD NIGHT, PETE.

1293
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,267
DON'T TAKE ANY WOODEN NICKELS.

1294
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:19,202
 I'LL TRY NOT TO.

1295
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:19,969
TAKE CARE OF HER.

1296
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:24,073
 I WILL.

1297
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,043
 GOOD NIGHT, LILY DALE.

1298
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,411
 GOOD NIGHT, YOUNG MAN.

1299
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:30,146
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

1300
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,158
 SHE SURE LOOKED PRETTY,
DIDN'T SHE?

1301
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,327
 YES.

1302
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,597
 ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1303
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,098
 YES.

1304
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,544
 I TOLD MR. DAVENPORT
THAT WHATEVER YOU SAID TO HIM

1305
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:04,480
JUST NOW, YOU WERE DELIRIOUS.

1306
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,083
 I WASN'T DELIRIOUS, MAMA.

1307
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,218
I KNEW WHAT I WAS SAYING.

1308
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:12,555
I'M LEAVING HERE
TOMORROW, MAMA.

1309
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,624
 HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

1310
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:18,194
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET
YOURSELF ACROSS THE FLOOR.

1311
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:23,466
 I'M GOING IF I HAVE
TO CRAWL OUT OF HERE.

1312
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:27,236
I'M GONNA ASK WILL TO COME
AND HELP ME OUT OF HERE,

1313
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,606
RIDE TO HARRISON WITH ME
ON THE TRAIN,

1314
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,909
OR I'LL MAKE IT MYSELF.

1315
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,178
 I DON'T WANT YOU
TO DO THAT NOW.

1316
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,246
 I'M GOING, MAMA.

1317
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,381
NOTHING WILL KEEP ME HERE.

1318
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:38,948
NOTHING.

1319
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,349
 WHERE WILL YOU GO?

1320
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,184
YOU HAVEN'T GOT A JOB.

1321
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:41,817
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

1322
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,187
 I'LL GO TO AUNT VIRGIE.

1323
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,088
SHE'LL NURSE ME.

1324
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,424
 I WANNA NURSE YOU.

1325
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,027
I WANNA DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

1326
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,295
PLEASE LET ME.

1327
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,472
 WELL...

1328
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:07,677
ANYWAY, IF YOU DECIDE TO
COME BACK AND STUDY AT

1329
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,313
THAT BUSINESS COURSE,
I HOPE YOU'LL REMEMBER

1330
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,515
TO COME OVER HERE
AND HAVE A GOOD BREAKFAST

1331
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,149
IN THE MORNING.

1332
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,484
WELL, HONEY, YOU'RE TIRED.

1333
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,220
I'LL JUST LET YOU REST.

1334
01:04:21,057 --> 01:04:22,124
 MAMA.

1335
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:24,327
 YES, SON.

1336
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:29,198
 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SONG
CALLED
LILY DALE?

1337
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:33,436
THE ONE PAPA
ALWAYS SANG TO SISTER?

1338
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,439
 WELL, LET'S SEE NOW.

1339
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,641
I SEEM TO REMEMBER HIM
SINGING IT, BUT I CAN'T

1340
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,209
REMEMBER HOW IT GOES.

1341
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:44,981
 TRY TO REMEMBER IT, MAMA.

1342
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,617
 WHY, HONEY?

1343
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,018
WHY?

1344
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,455
 BECAUSE I WANNA REMEMBER IT.

1345
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,457
 ALL RIGHT, I'LL TRY.

1346
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,426
I'LL CERTAINLY TRY.

1347
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:00,296
RIGHT NOW?

1348
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,564
 YES.

1349
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:08,971
 I JUST CAN'T.

1350
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:11,240
BUT I'LL KEEP ON TRYING.

1351
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,588
 ( indistinct chatter )
 NO.

1352
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,523
 ARE YOU GONNA TELL YOUR MAMA
WHAT THAT REPORTER

1353
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:29,325
FROM THE PAPER SAID TO YOU?

1354
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,760
 I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HE SAID.

1355
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:31,494
WHAT DID HE SAY?

1356
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,095
 YOU DON'T?

1357
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,064
I THINK HE SAID YOU WERE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DANCER

1358
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,766
AT THE WHOLE DANCE.

1359
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,135
 I THINK HE SAID I WAS
THE MOST GRACEFUL DANCER

1360
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:39,969
HE'D EVER SEEN.

1361
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:43,739
 I THOUGHT YOU
FORGOT WHAT HE SAID.

1362
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,508
DIDN'T I TELL YOU I'D
HAVE HER HOME BY 12:30?

1363
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,076
 SHH, SHH, SHH.

1364
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,320
 DID YOU HAVE A GOOD EVENING?

1365
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,089
 WONDERFUL EVENING.

1366
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,657
 SHOW HER YOUR PRESENT.

1367
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:05,728
 OH, MY GOODNESS.

1368
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,464
 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

1369
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,533
 WELL...

1370
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,034
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1371
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,237
 WHAT DO YOU THINK IT COST ME?

1372
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,672
 I HAVE NO IDEA.

1373
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,441
 PLENTY.

1374
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,711
BUT I THOUGHT NOTHING IS
TOO MUCH FOR MY SWEETHEART.

1375
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,680
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN, WILL?

1376
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,082
 IT MEANS WE'RE ENGAGED.

1377
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:27,550
I'VE ASKED HER TO MARRY ME.

1378
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:31,487
 ( crying )
 ( sniffles )

1379
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:43,566
DARLING...

1380
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,635
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO GET MARRIED.

1381
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,305
WILL, PLEASE BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S TOO YOUNG.

1382
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,773
I HAVE NOTHING,
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

1383
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:51,841
IN THE WORLD AGAINST YOU.

1384
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,576
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT.

1385
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:54,777
 WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

1386
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,313
WE'RE NOT GETTING
MARRIED TOMORROW.

1387
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,315
I HAVE SOME SENSE, YOU KNOW.

1388
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,716
I'M MAKING MY PLANS.

1389
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,586
I'M GONNA WORK HARD FOR
A YEAR, SAVE MY MONEY...

1390
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,421
AND WHEN I HAVE
A FEW THOUSAND IN THE BANK,

1391
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:06,722
THEN WE'LL MARRY.

1392
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:10,192
DO YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTIONS
TO THAT PLAN?

1393
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,495
 WELL, I GUESS NOT.

1394
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,730
BUT YOU'LL PROMISE ME
YOU'LL WAIT A YEAR, WON'T YOU?

1395
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,565
 I'M NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES.

1396
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:17,867
I MIGHT WANNA BE
MARRIED TOMORROW.

1397
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,503
 OH, WILL, PLEASE BE SERIOUS.

1398
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,338
 OH, I'M SERIOUS.

1399
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:26,342
WE'LL WAIT AS LONG AS YOU
WANT US TO, WON'T WE, HONEY?

1400
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,112
 ( crying )
 LILY DALE.

1401
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,580
 SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1402
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:35,151
SHE'S BEEN A LITTLE UPSET
ALL EVENING.

1403
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:39,288
I THINK HIS BEING HERE
GETS HER UPSET.

1404
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,323
SHE SAID HE TALKED MEAN
TO HER TONIGHT.

1405
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:42,892
 OH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ALL WENT ON.

1406
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,360
HE'S UPSET, TOO.

1407
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,628
HE TOLD ME.

1408
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,530
HE WANTS YOU TO TAKE HIM
TO THE STATION TOMORROW.

1409
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,531
HE WANTS TO GO HOME.

1410
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:51,500
I JUST DON'T THINK HE'S
STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT

1411
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:54,437
ON HIS OWN, BUT HE'S
DETERMINED TO GO.

1412
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,273
 I'M SORRY, WILL.

1413
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,341
I BET YOU THINK I'M CRAZY.

1414
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,476
 NO, I DON'T.

1415
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:04,447
I JUST THINK YOU'RE
SWEET AND PRETTY.

1416
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,248
CAN I KISS HER GOOD NIGHT?

1417
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,551
WE'RE ENGAGED.

1418
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,587
 ( sighs )
ALL RIGHT.

1419
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,289
ALL RIGHT.

1420
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:23,933
 GOOD NIGHT.

1421
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:25,601
 GOOD NIGHT, WILL.

1422
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:26,802
 GOOD NIGHT, MISS CORELLA.

1423
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,471
 GOOD NIGHT, WILL.

1424
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:39,682
 ( door shuts )
 ( sighs )

1425
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:42,685
WELL...

1426
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,920
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

1427
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,389
I'M VERY PLEASED FOR YOU.

1428
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,958
NOW...

1429
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,827
WE BETTER GET TO BED.

1430
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:52,795
 MAMA.

1431
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,697
 MM-HMM.

1432
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:59,435
 WHAT DO THEY DO TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED TO...

1433
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,538
MAKE YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

1434
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:05,374
 OH, DON'T ASK ME SUCH
QUESTIONS THIS TIME OF NIGHT,

1435
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,575
LILY DALE. HEAVENS.

1436
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,945
 LAVINIA SAYS YOUR HUSBAND
DOES TERRIBLE THINGS TO YOU.

1437
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,313
DOES HE?

1438
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,649
 IT'S NOT SO TERRIBLE.

1439
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,918
 WHAT IS IT?

1440
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:18,654
 UH, IT'S JUST...

1441
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:22,658
WHAT A HUSBAND DOES TO A WIFE
WHEN THEY'RE MARRIED,

1442
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,426
THAT'S ALL.

1443
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,661
WELL, YOU'LL FIND OUT.

1444
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:26,695
 WHEN?

1445
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:30,266
 WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED.

1446
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,700
 DOES IT HURT?

1447
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:33,903
 I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE
SAY THAT IT HURTS,

1448
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:34,937
BUT IT NEVER HURT ME.

1449
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,872
 DOES IT HURT
TO HAVE CHILDREN?

1450
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:41,010
 YES, AND I PRAY TO GOD YOU
NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT.

1451
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,711
 WILL WANTS TO HAVE CHILDREN.

1452
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,381
 WELL, THEN HE IS A FOOL,
AND DON'T YOU EVER LET HIM

1453
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:46,549
TALK YOU INTO IT.

1454
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:49,418
 WOMEN DIE IN CHILDBIRTH,
DON'T THEY?

1455
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:50,386
 ALL THE TIME.

1456
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,388
EVERY MINUTE OF THE HOUR.

1457
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,690
WHEN I HAD YOU AND YOUR BROTHER,
I PRAYED TO GOD

1458
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,425
THAT I WOULD DIE.

1459
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,092
 WHY?

1460
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,861
 BECAUSE IT HURT SO MUCH.

1461
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:02,464
I WAS IN TERROR
THE ENTIRE TIME.

1462
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:03,499
 IS THE DANCE OVER?

1463
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:04,700
 OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

1464
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,501
WE WOKE YOU UP.

1465
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,201
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

1466
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,804
 HOW WAS THE DANCE, LILY DALE?

1467
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:13,842
 IT WAS VERY NICE.

1468
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,912
 LILY DALE IS ENGAGED
TO BE MARRIED.

1469
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,548
SHOW YOUR BROTHER YOUR RING.

1470
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:26,322
 IT COST $125.

1471
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:27,556
 HOW DO YOU KNOW?

1472
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,792
 WILL TOLD ME.

1473
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,961
HE PAID CASH FOR IT.

1474
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,463
 YOU KNOW, PAPA DID SING
LILY DALE
 TO YOU WHEN

1475
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,331
YOU WERE A GIRL.

1476
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,665
AND YOU GOT YOUR NAME
FROM THAT SONG.

1477
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:37,766
MAMA TOLD ME.

1478
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,369
 WELL, I DON'T CARE
WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT OR NOT,

1479
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,072
IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING
TO ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

1480
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:45,808
 AND, MAMA, I REMEMBERED
HOW THE SONG GOES.

1481
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:51,447
( humming )
 YEAH, THAT'S IT.

1482
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,086
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

1483
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,521
 YOU'LL HAVE TO LEARN IT AND
TEACH IT TO YOUR CHILDREN,

1484
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:00,789
LILY DALE.

1485
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,691
 I'M NOT GONNA HAVE CHILDREN.

1486
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,525
 YOU'RE NOT?

1487
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:04,426
 NO!

1488
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,828
 WHY?

1489
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,963
 BECAUSE.

1490
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,967
ANYWAY, IF I DID HAVE CHILDREN,
I WOULDN'T SING THEM THAT SONG.

1491
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,035
 WHY?

1492
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:16,038
 BECAUSE I WANNA FORGET
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

1493
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:16,739
BACK THEN.

1494
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,641
EVERYTHING.

1495
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,410
AND I WANT YOU TO QUIT
TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT.

1496
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,779
EVERY TIME I FEEL THE LEAST
BIT GOOD, YOU BEGIN ON ALL THAT.

1497
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,881
"WHAT DID PAPA CALL US?

1498
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:26,749
WHAT DID HE SING?

1499
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,350
DID PAPA DO THIS?

1500
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,119
DID PAPA DO THAT?"
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM.

1501
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,887
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THAT?

1502
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,956
I DON'T CARE IF I EVER
HEAR HIS NAME AGAIN.

1503
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,491
MR. DAVENPORT IS MY FATHER.

1504
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:36,792
HE'S THE ONLY ONE I WANT.

1505
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,961
YOU HAVE NO FATHER,
BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT!

1506
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:41,730
I HAVE ONE, THE ONLY ONE I WANT!

1507
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:45,968
 SHE DOESN'T MEAN THAT, SON.

1508
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:46,835
YOU KNOW...

1509
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,872
SHE'S JUST ALL EXCITED
ABOUT THE DANCE

1510
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:51,507
AND GETTING ENGAGED
AND EVERYTHING.

1511
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,877
 I DON'T CARE, MAMA,
IF THAT'S HOW SHE FEELS.

1512
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:58,914
 HORACE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T TALK SO MUCH ABOUT

1513
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,150
YOUR PAPA.

1514
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,386
MR. DAVENPORT
IS VERY SENSITIVE.

1515
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:07,156
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES IT MUCH.

1516
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,658
 I DON'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT MY FATHER.

1517
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,694
I WOULDN'T, THANK YOU.

1518
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,495
 LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

1519
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:14,763
MAMA DIDN'T LOVE OUR PAPA.

1520
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:17,800
SHE LOVES MR. DAVENPORT BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN GOOD TO HER AND TO ME.

1521
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,935
SO DON'T LET ME EVER HEAR YOU
SAY ANOTHER WORD AGAINST HIM.

1522
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:22,071
BECAUSE IF YOU DO, I'LL TELL HIM
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID AND

1523
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:23,839
HE'LL THROW YOU OUT OF THIS
HOUSE AND NEVER LET

1524
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,841
YOU IN HERE AGAIN
TO UPSET ME AND MAMA!

1525
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:28,043
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER!

1526
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,179
 HE'LL NEVER GET THE CHANCE
TO THROW ME OUT.

1527
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,380
 HORACE.

1528
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,182
 I'M GETTING ON MY CLOTHES
AND I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

1529
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,083
 YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

1530
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,351
 YES, I CAN.

1531
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:38,854
AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE IF I HAVE
TO CRAWL OUT OF HERE ON MY HANDS

1532
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:42,758
AND ON MY KNEES.

1533
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,459
 HORACE!

1534
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:46,795
 OH, BROTHER!

1535
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,965
I'M SO SORRY, BROTHER.

1536
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:53,669
I DIDN'T MEAN A WORD OF
THE TERRIBLE THINGS I SAID.

1537
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,003
NOT A ONE.

1538
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,474
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GETS
INTO ME SOMETIMES, BROTHER.

1539
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,776
I HAVE A TERRIBLE DISPOSITION.

1540
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,444
TERRIBLE DISPOSITION.

1541
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:05,948
IT'S THE ROBEDAUX
COMING OUT IN ME.

1542
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,150
BROTHER...

1543
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,552
PLEASE, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

1544
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:12,554
PLEASE.

1545
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,623
PLEASE.

1546
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,759
I LOVED PAPA.

1547
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:20,195
BELIEVE ME, I DID,
JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DID,

1548
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,831
BUT IT HURTS ME SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT HIM,

1549
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:23,966
AND IT SCARES ME, TOO.

1550
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,701
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT SCARES ME.

1551
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,669
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT...

1552
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:33,008
( crying )
I CAN HEAR PAPA COUGHING

1553
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:36,678
AND STRUGGLING TO BREATHE
LIKE HE USED TO.

1554
01:13:36,712 --> 01:13:39,548
AND I DIDN'T MEAN WHAT I SAID
ABOUT YOU LEAVING.

1555
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,017
I WANT YOU TO STAY
UNTIL YOU'RE ALL WELL

1556
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:45,854
AND STRONG AGAIN, BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE ONLY BROTHER I HAVE.

1557
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:50,559
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT,
I THINK I CAN SEE YOU DEAD

1558
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:53,662
AND IN YOUR COFFIN.

1559
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,932
AND I CRY IN MY DREAMS
LIKE MY HEART WILL BREAK.

1560
01:13:56,965 --> 01:14:00,035
AND I'M REALLY CRYING, TOO,
BECAUSE MY CRYING WAKES ME UP,

1561
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,738
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,
"BROTHER'S ALIVE.

1562
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:03,605
HE'S NOT DEAD AT ALL.

1563
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:04,940
IT'S JUST A DREAM."

1564
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,142
BUT STILL, I JUST
FEEL SO MISERABLE.

1565
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:11,513
I JUST LIE THERE SOBBING
LIKE MY HEART WILL BREAK.

1566
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,516
AND SOMETIMES MAMA HEARS ME
AND SHE COMES IN AND SHE SAYS,

1567
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,619
"LILY DALE, WHY ARE YOU CRYING?"
AND I SAY, "BECAUSE I DREAMT

1568
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:24,593
AGAIN THAT BROTHER HAD DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN AND LEFT US."

1569

1735
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,345
 I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU,
LITTLE GIRL.

1736
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,779
WHERE'S YOUR MAMA?

1737
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:07,816
 SHE TOOK BROTHER FOR A WALK
TO HELP HIM GET HIS

1738
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:08,883

1739
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,652
 YEAH, WE'RE GONNA LOSE
THE OLD BOY TOMORROW.

1740
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:12,787
 UNCLE ALBERT'S
COMING FOR HIM.

1741
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,789
 WHAT TIME IS HE LEAVING?

1742
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,692
 2:30, I GUESS.

1743
01:23:17,726 --> 01:23:20,095
THAT IS IF ALBERT DOESN'T
GET INTO A GAMBLING GAME.

1744
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:21,429
THEY'RE A FOOL TO SEND ALBERT.

1745
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:24,265
EVERY PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER
IN HOUSTON KNOWS HIM.

1746
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:25,700
 BUT HE HAS TO GO BACK.

1747
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,168
HE'S GOT A STORE NOW, YOU KNOW?

1748
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,170
 NOTHING NEVER STOPPED HIM
FROM GAMBLING.

1749
01:23:29,204 --> 01:23:33,308
NOT HIS JOB, NOT HIS WIFE,
NOT HIS CHILDREN.

1750
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,577

1751
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:43,184

FOR SOMEONE ELSE AGAIN.

1752
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,153
 DID YOU HAVE A NICE WALK?

1753
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,856

01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:56,531
AT LEAST UNTIL HE GETS
HIS STRENGTH BACK.

1758
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:59,167
SHE'S A WONDERFUL COOK,
AND SHE LOVES HIM.

1759
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,735
 DOES SHE HAVE ANY
CHILDREN OF HER OWN?

1760
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,137

HER HUSBAND SAID AFTER SEEING
WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH

1763
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,743
TO HAVE JUST THAT ONE,
THEY COULD DRAG HIM AROUND

1764
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,212
THE COURTHOUSE SQUARE
BEFORE HE'D LET HER

1765
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,848

 MR. DAVENPORT.

1898

HE'S A VERY GOOD MAN.

HE'S BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME.

1900
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:35,596
HE JUST DOESN'T SEEM
TO LIKE YOUR BROTHER.

I WISH THAT WOULD CHANGE.

 BROTHER DOESN'T
LIKE HIM, EITHER.

YOU'RE GONNA GET MARRIED...
