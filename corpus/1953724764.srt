2
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:43,690
This is how life begins...
... For all of us.

3
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:48,376
The male and female DNA
are matched

4
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:51,347
to make sure everything
comes out just right ...

5
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:55,139
The egg is fertilized;
the DNA are combined ...

6
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,485
and the baby starts to grow.

7
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,673
Before the Wars ...

8
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:03,530
men and women
would match their own DNA.

9
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:06,000
Then...
anything could happen.

10
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:07,788
That was very dangerous.

11
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:11,303
Children belonged to them ...

12
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:13,673
...like objects.

13
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:16,988
They did not value freedom
like we do today.

14
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:20,760
It was called 'Family'

15
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:25,864
We've come a long way
since then.

16
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,804
<i> "Today we have no crime ...</i>

17
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:37,459
<i> no disease, no war,
aging, or suffering. "</i>

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,330
<i> "Each of us is
genetically designed ...</i>

19
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:43,618
<i> to fit perfectly into
our place in society. "</i>

20
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:44,884
<i> "So everyone's happy." </i>

21
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:47,610
Very nice.
Good job, Gabriel.

22
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:52,550
I do not understand. How were children
decanted in the old days?.

23
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,642
The children were not decanted.
They were born.

24
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:58,350
After a woman and
a man had sex ...

25
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,987
the woman would get pregnant
and then give birth.

26
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:02,253
Like animals?

27
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:03,734
It's hard to believe.

28
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:08,181
It was a very painful,
dangerous and degrading experience.

29
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:10,600
So. Were they afraid
to have sex?

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,700
Sometimes.

31
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:14,560
If a man and a woman
wanted to have babies ...

32
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,350
They would get married.

33
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,972
And then they were supposed to
have sex with each other.

34
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,125
For how long?

35
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,641
Their whole lives.

36
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,300
You mean they were 
'Mothers' and 'Fathers'?

37
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,100
There is no need to
use bad language.

38
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:30,037
The old system encouraged
many negative things.

39
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,909
Envy, deceit, possessiveness,
Children raised in bad conditions.

40
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,774
And they had no Soma to ease the pain.

41
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:40,487
Life was very different
before the Wars.

42
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:43,114
It wasn't until the world
was unified...

43
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:48,017
Under a rational scientifically enlightened
government that real progress could occur.

44
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,900
And now we live in luxury,
harmony and safety.

45
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:53,780
<i> Could there be a better time
to be alive? </i>

46
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:57,150
<i> Let the world say, thank you ...
with Soma.</i>

47
00:04:01,504 --> 00:04:04,614
<i> There is a place,
and a purpose for everyone. </i>

48
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,390
<i> So everyone is happy. </i>

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,009
<i>And we all have fun:
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta...</i>

50
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:14,517
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else. </i>

51
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:17,818
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>

52
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,549
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>

53
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,051
<i>I am so glad I'm an Alpha...</i>

54
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,552
<i> I'd hate to be a dull as a
Delta. </i>

55
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:26,653
<i> ...or have to take
orders like a Gamma. </i>

56
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:29,652
<i> Or to keep track of things
like a Beta. </i>

57
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,900
<i> Everyone is useful.</i>

58
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:35,054
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>

59
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,855
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>

60
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,100
<i> But I'm glad to be an Alpha. </i>

61
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:42,752
<i> There is a place,
and a purpose for everyone. </i>

62
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:45,583
<i> So everyone is happy. </i>

63
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:50,394
It's OK
Have some more Soma.

64
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,256
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else. </i>

65
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:55,957
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>

66
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,558
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>

67
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,559
<i> But I'm glad to be an Alpha. </i>

68
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
<i> I'd hate to be a dull as a
Delta. </i>

69
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,861
<i> ...or have to take
orders like a Gamma. </i>

70
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,462
<i> Or to keep track of things
like a Beta. </i>

71
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:09,463
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,863
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>

73
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,310
<i> Everyone is useful.  </i>

74
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,564
There you are, buddy boy.
I've been looking for you.

75
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:27,200
Marx, shake a leg:
the Director is waiting.

76
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:36,036
Have you people seen
these test results?

77
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:41,568
Anxiety and work disorders for Delta
and Gamma workers, are up for the third quarter running.

78
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:44,857
Self-esteem and contentment numbers
are down!

79
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:47,801
It could be because they were
so high before?

80
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,788
We have an idea for the new
conditioning campaign ...

81
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,961
It's a light-hearted approach,
with slogans like,

82
00:05:57,962 --> 00:06:03,283
"They say we only use
10% of our brain ...

83
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,070
... That's way too much. "

84
00:06:07,364 --> 00:06:08,877
Irony, Ingram?

85
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,457
I do not think Deltas
can get it.

86
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:15,092
Is it possible we focus
too much on the conditioning?

87
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,234
And not enough on the people being conditioned?

88
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:18,674
'Not sure I follow

89
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:21,292
Perhaps if we spent less time
telling people how happy they are...

90
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,887
we might figure out what makes them unhappy,
and design conditioning to help them.

91
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:27,019
Marx, please ...
Don't turn a shoddy performance...

92
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,875
Into an attack to the whole the program.

93
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,292
I didn't mean it as an attack ...

94
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,267
Excuse me Miss ...

95
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,902
How do you feel about being a Delta?

96
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:35,903
Are you happy?

97
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,581
I'm glad I'm a Delta.

98
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,082
Alphas have to think things through...

99
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,919
Betas and Gammas have
too much to do.

100
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,705
So you see, Mr. Marx, Deltas are happy ...
There are just some isolated failures.

101
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,453
The system works.

102
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:52,626
62.400 repetitions
make one truth, Bernard.

103
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,473
It's an indisputable fact.

104
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:57,216
Well, they could work better.

105
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:57,841
"Ingram?

106
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,885
Do some work on that campaign
and get back to me, please?

107
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,447
You're crazy, you know that?

108
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:06,369
Bernard, emotional engineering
is what we do ...

109
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:07,730
How could you be against it?

110
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,634
I'm not against it;
I'm just saying ...

111
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:10,816
there's room for improvement.

112
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,493
"Soma? Just one gram
and you won't give a damn.

113
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:23,343
Lenina ...

114
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,287
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.

115
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:30,723
How about coming with me to...
Ash Wednesday Services tomorrow?

116
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:35,481
Thanks, but I'm afraid
that I already have plans.

117
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:38,287
Are you going to join me 
this weekend?

118
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:40,987
I'm booked this weekend.

119
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:43,723
Another time.

120
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:46,532
Yes, absolutely
another time.

121
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,708
So ...

122
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,743
Who are you going with tonight?

123
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,019
Bernard.

124
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,123
Again?

125
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:55,892
You're still having Bernard Marx?

126
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,372
It's been a couple of months ...

127
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:00,410
Have you had sex with anybody else
since then?

128
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,300
What's wrong with you?

129
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:03,422
Nothing's wrong with me.

130
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:05,077
I just like Bernard.

131
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:07,869
I think he's fun, and sexy and...

132
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:10,444
... Different.

133
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:11,725
"Different?

134
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:13,045
You want different?

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,948
Try different people.

136
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:16,332
We're just having a good time.

137
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,800
Then don't keep it all
to yourself.

138
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:21,022
It's antisocial.

139
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,392
You were so promiscuous in school.

140
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:26,829
A little Miss Perfect.

141
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:31,076
Promiscuity,
is a citizen's duty.

142
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:32,765
It's not just me.

143
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:36,589
Everyone is starting to talk about
the two of you.

144
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,383
You're right, Fanny.

145
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,629
Soma?

146
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,688
Our path is clear and sunny.

147
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:56,521
Be thankful that we live now.

148
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:58,578
Never put off till tomorrow...

149
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,704
The fun you can have today.

150
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,034
<i>Citizens of the world  ...</i>

151
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,270
<i> Happy Ash Wednesday. </i>

152
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,700
<i>Tonight the world
is at peace. </i>

153
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,097
<i>Because we're
organized and united. </i>

154
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,346
<i>So  ...</i>

155
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,397
<i>Let us give thanks </i>

156
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:22,269
<i> ... and have fun.
Be Happy. </i>

157
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,452
<i> And don't leave anyone out. </i>

158
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:25,412
<i> Remember: </i>

159
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:31,283
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else.</i>

160
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:46,137
Waiting for someone?

161
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,707
Yes, but you'll do...

162
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,300
... for now.

163
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,350
We should join the others.

164
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,452
Why?
Why should it be tonight?

165
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,332
Hey, Fanny!

166
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:13,133
So we've been seeing a lot of each other,
so what?

167
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,500
Fanny says it's antisocial.

168
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,798
Well, if you ask me, she's long overdue

169
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:20,764
for violent passion surrogate.

170
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:25,394
Has it been really
six months?

171
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:28,854
Yes. And you know
how people talk.

172
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:30,885
Let them talk.

173
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:32,942
They have nothing to say.

174
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:36,373
We can still see each other.
We can still sleep together.

175
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:39,103
We just... have to have
other people.

176
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,648
All right.

177
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:45,179
You know if this were before the War,
you know what we'd do, don't you?

178
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,496
We'd get married!

179
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:50,350
You're still coming with me
to the Reservation next week?

180
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,488
Yes, and we can still, uhm...

181
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:55,988
Find a couple nutty savages
to fool around.

182
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,803
Hello, Bernard.

183
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,398
Hello.

184
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,700
Hello.

185
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,835
I guess I am free
tonight.

186
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:24,525
<i>Universal Happiness keeps
the wheels of society steadily turning.</i>

187
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,974
<i> Work is fun. </i>

188
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,975
<i>The harder we work, </i>

189
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,889
<i> the more things we can buy.</i>

190
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:53,560
<i>New Things!
I hate old things! </i>

191
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,679
<i> I want all new things. </i>

192
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,134
<i>Ending is better than mending. </i>

193
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,526
<i>If it's broken, don't fix it </i>

194
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,869
<i>Ending is better than mending.  </i>

195
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,962
<i> You work hard,
always doing your best.</i>

196
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,745
<i> So when your workday is done ...</i>

197
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,267
<i> ... you want all life can give. </i>

198
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:15,131
<i>You want Soma. </i>

199
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:18,836
<i> Let the world say, Thank you
with Soma. </i>

200
00:13:18,871 --> 00:13:20,695
<i> Work is fun ...</i>

201
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:21,854
<i>The harder we work, </i>

202
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,255
<i> the more things we can buy.</i>

203
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,118
<i> .. New Things!
I hate old things! </i>

204
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,496
<i> I want all new things. </i>

205
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:31,760
<i>Ending is better than mending.  </i>

206
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,592
<i>If it's broken, don't fix it </i>

207
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:36,050
<i>Ending is better than mending.  </i>

208
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:39,554
<i> You work hard,
always doing your best.</i>

209
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:58,242
James?

210
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:01,001
Not another one!

211
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:09,172
Get back to work.

212
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,867
I said back to work.

213
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:14,716
What's in your hand?

214
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,227
Are you going back to work or not?

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,699
Take care of it!

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,950
After the Wars,

217
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,083
When society was reformed...

218
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:44,557
There were still factions who refused
to be part of the World Government.

219
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:48,000
These fringe groups now
inhabit the Reservation.

220
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:51,500
Clinging to the borders of
civilized society.

221
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:54,087
At the edges of the
Great Wilderness.

222
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:56,577
While we have advanced ...

223
00:14:56,577 --> 00:15:00,678
these savages retain their
primitive way of life.

224
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:08,797
Though the borders are
strictly sealed ...

225
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:11,524
some of us have access.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,544
The poverty and hardship remind us
how lucky we are.

227
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,229
Can we go any lower?

228
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:26,886
It's stricly discouraged.
'Might lead to contact with the savages.

229
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,098
How can they live like this?

230
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:31,469
Maybe there's something to it.

231
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,445
Living off the land.

232
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:36,672
Nothing given to you:
a constant struggle for survival.

233
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,524
Oh, you'd love that, Bernard!

234
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,000
What's happening?

235
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,085
Not sure.
Hang on!.

236
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,567
Hang on,
we're going down!

237
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:11,429
No... get out of here... not here.

238
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,415
Come on!

239
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,423
I'll contact Border authorities.
'Hope this works.

240
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,207
That is not necessary.

241
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:36,373
They'll track us with the satellites.
They know where we are.

242
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,428
Hello.

243
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,941
How are you?
We're fine, thank you very much.

244
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:04,654
Had a little accident!

245
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,240
You probably can see.

246
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:09,012
We sure could use a little help.

247
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:17,200
We'll r escue you!

248
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,946
You'll like it!

249
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:25,618
She does not want you to do that.

250
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:27,760
Sucker!

251
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,723
Enough.

252
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,500
Leave us alone.

253
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,556
-The Buck, John.
You should thank Mom.

254
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:50,396
Get back with your Ma's.

255
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,689
...the savages... don't...

256
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,099
He's delirious.

257
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,493
"Sleep that knits up
the ravell’d sleeve of care..."

258
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,723
We should go,
I'll get you to my mother's.

259
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:30,455
What did you just say?

260
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:33,100
From "Macbeth:"
Shakespeare.

261
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,013
We'll be all right.

262
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,675
This is my Mother.

263
00:19:57,132 --> 00:20:00,450
How lovely, to have you
at our home.

264
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,700
Real civilized people.

265
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,546
How beautiful you are!

266
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:12,769
But the way we live ...

267
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:17,082
You must think it's
so ugly and grim!

268
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,291
No.

269
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:21,384
What I should offer you?

270
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,889
I put it somewhere...

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,882
I think I...

272
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,980
... Somewhere.

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,100
Oh, God.

274
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,981
God.

275
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:41,056
My headaches

276
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:45,770
It is so rude of me.
I'm so sorry.

277
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:51,500
I'm so sorry... it's no way
to treat our guests.

278
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,443
Mother ...

279
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,066
Relax.

280
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,611
John.

281
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:59,400
If I could just have a little drink...

282
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,397
Relax.

283
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,999
I love you.

284
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,763
What happened to you?

285
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,383
My initiation scars.

286
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:42,467
It must have been painful.

287
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,019
That's the idea.

288
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:46,900
How did you get all of this?

289
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,074
Linda got'em.

290
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,631
Mostly from my father.

291
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,962
Of course.

292
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,959
I never knew him,
he was one of you.

293
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,415
One of us?

294
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:58,164
He worked at Border Center.

295
00:21:58,164 --> 00:21:59,268
She was just a girl.

296
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:01,612
She flirted with him,
he gave her presents.

297
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:05,763
Told her that she was sexier
than any of the girls in Paris or New York ...

298
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:07,282
He seduced her.

299
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:10,508
And took her over to the other side

300
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:13,500
Showed the Soma bars,
when she got pregnant, he dumped her back here.

301
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,851
It was the last time she ever saw him.

302
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:16,778
What was his name?

303
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:20,244
She is not really sure,
She thinks maybe it was "Alpha."

304
00:22:20,444 --> 00:22:25,237
And then he abandonded her
back in this miserable place.

305
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,622
Sorry, I did not mean to...

306
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:29,252
You're right, it is miserable.

307
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,232
Life isn't worth much here.

308
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:34,947
Nobody cares about truth or
beauty ...

309
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:38,263
They live off the scraps of civilization,
they don't even know what it is.

310
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,564
Len.

311
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,349
What?

312
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,456
Shakespeare.

313
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:52,486
"Since brass, nor stone,
nor earth, nor boundless sea,

314
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:56,077
"But sad mortality
o'ersways their power,

315
00:22:56,077 --> 00:23:00,021
"How with this rage
shall beauty hold a plea,

316
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:05,078
...Whose action is no
stronger than a flower?"

317
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:07,424
Where did you get all these
pre-War books?

318
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:09,319
Around.

319
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,500
I saved most of them from being
used as kindling.

320
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,052
Why do you read them?

321
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:22,888
Because they put into words
what you feel but can't say.

322
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:26,391
It sounds like your ride's here.

323
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,603
To walk down those beautiful avenues!

324
00:23:40,904 --> 00:23:43,314
To see all the shops!

325
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:45,850
All the lovely people...

326
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,841
Soma.

327
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:49,980
I want Soma again.

328
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,988
I do not understand what
you are doing.

329
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:53,251
I have a plan.

330
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:56,060
Imagine the research possibilities.

331
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,957
Don't worry.

332
00:23:56,957 --> 00:24:00,000
Mond knows we're bringing them back.

333
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:14,760
You two are married?

334
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,331
No.

335
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:20,919
You've got a lot to learn about
Civilization, John.

336
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,485
"How many goodly creatures
are there here!

337
00:25:38,485 --> 00:25:40,867
"How beauteous mankind is!

338
00:25:40,902 --> 00:25:42,768
"O brave new world,

339
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:45,247
... That has such people in't! "

340
00:25:49,837 --> 00:25:52,200
I just wanted ....

341
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,580
to see what would happen ...

342
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,733
... If I stopped.

343
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,017
What did you think would happen?

344
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,844
If a person stops,
the whole line stops.

345
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:03,721
And then production stops.

346
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:07,556
What happens if production stops?

347
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:12,476
If production stops,
then distribution misses their quota

348
00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:16,064
Its economics, you would not understand.

349
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm recommending a ten-day
Reconditioning holiday.

350
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,964
When you're done,

351
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,731
You'll feel as good as new, OK?

352
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:27,889
-Sir?
- What is it now?

353
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,602
It's most irregular, sir.

354
00:26:46,574 --> 00:26:49,103
This is the Conditioning Center.

355
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,304
Where I work.

356
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:52,351
Ingram.

357
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,963
John Cooper.

358
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:56,100
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.

359
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,373
Ingram is an Associate Predestinator.

360
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,412
John is a savage.

361
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,324
What's going on here, Marx?

362
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:04,916
John, I'd like you to meet the Director
of Hatcheries and Conditioning.

363
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,418
John's from the Reservation.

364
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:11,470
From the Reservation
and you brought him here. Are you insane?

365
00:27:11,471 --> 00:27:12,670
I don't think so.

366
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,829
He's practically one of us.

367
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,546
That's obscene.
You've crossed the line this time.

368
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:22,520
Excuse me...

369
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:26,739
-I hope I'm not interrupting?

370
00:27:26,739 --> 00:27:29,932
Not at all, Controller Mond,
I just wasn't expecting you.

371
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:34,063
I understand I'm not the only
unexpected visitor today.

372
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,617
Bernard Marx?

373
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:38,953
Yes, sir.

374
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,516
And this is John?

375
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:41,763
John Cooper.

376
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:45,107
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Cooper,
you've come a long way.

377
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:47,291
I'm sure your visit here
will be very interesting for you.

378
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,862
And for us.

379
00:27:48,863 --> 00:27:50,844
I'm having a small gathering.

380
00:27:50,844 --> 00:27:53,525
I'd like you both to be there.

381
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:56,913
You're invited too, Thomas.

382
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:19,027
Am I going to live here?.

383
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,700
I hope you like it.

384
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,901
It's nothing special.

385
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:24,957
Are you kidding me?
Like it? I love it!

386
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,276
What a beautiful view!

387
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:30,577
Beautiful.

388
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,975
Linda, tell me about John.

389
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,915
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like him before.

390
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:40,220
He's so ...

391
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,126
... Different.

392
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:42,602
John is ...

393
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,510
... Is my baby.

394
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:46,414
My precious boy.

395
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:49,101
The most beautiful son a mother could have.

396
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:52,844
The Soma you gave me
it's beginning to wear off

397
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:54,693
Could I have some more?

398
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,722
Sure.

399
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,770
Thank you.

400
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,239
I think that maybe...

401
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:06,258
Oh...lovely...

402
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,261
62.400 repetitions
make one truth.

403
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,360
<i> Our lead story tonight: ...</i>

404
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,094
<i> ... there's something new in town... </i>

405
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,900
<i> And he's savagely attractive. </i>

406
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,941
Lenina.

407
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:39,552
Hi. How are you?

408
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:40,379
I'm fine.

409
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,679
It's so great to see you.

410
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,381
So tell me ...

411
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:46,164
Those primitives actually threatened
you of physical violence?

412
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:48,204
Yes, they did.

413
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:51,831
And you were prepared
to do physical violence to defend them?

414
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:53,774
It wasn't needed.

415
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:58,345
What an exciting story!
My heart is pounding!

416
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:00,416
Do you feel it?

417
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:05,868
Quite a change from the Reservation.

418
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:08,818
You're a friend of the Savage, right?

419
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:09,555
Yes.

420
00:31:09,555 --> 00:31:12,794
So tell me: what's he like in bed?

421
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,888
-I couldn't tell ...
-Come on!

422
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:20,454
I don't think I could describe it.

423
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:24,797
Why did you do that?

424
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:25,656
Do what?

425
00:31:25,656 --> 00:31:27,874
Playing you slept with John.

426
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:30,290
What difference does it make?

427
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,539
You haven't, have you?

428
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,815
Not yet.

429
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,373
- Mr. Marx?
- Sir.

430
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:42,464
Could I have a moment
in private?

431
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:44,383
Certainly.

432
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,379
Surprised, Mr. Marx?

433
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,904
I find a certain charm...

434
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,459
In these primitive artifacts ...

435
00:32:23,543 --> 00:32:25,679
... a sort of depth that is lacking...

436
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,613
... in our world today.

437
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,285
I've even dabbled in some of the
extinct languages

438
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,812
French, Russian, German ...

439
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:40,902
As Controller it's my duty to see...

440
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:43,030
that such eccentric tastes...

441
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:45,476
don't infect the general population.

442
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,761
Art and philosophy can be ...

443
00:32:47,761 --> 00:32:50,956
so unsettling to the social good.

444
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:54,546
I'm happy to meet you at last, Marx.

445
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:58,574
Your name has crossed my desk often
in departmental briefings.

446
00:32:58,574 --> 00:33:02,337
You must have a pretty bad impression
if you go by the DHC's reports

447
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:04,046
On the contrary.

448
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:07,071
Between you and me, I find
your Director's disapproval ...

449
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,541
a positive sign
of your potential.

450
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:11,588
Now ...
You must tell me...

451
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,610
Why did you bring Mr. Cooper here
to Civilization?

452
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,849
As you know, our conditioning results
have been falling lately.

453
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:19,635
And no one knows why.

454
00:33:19,636 --> 00:33:23,147
I see John as raw material
for emotionary research.

455
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:25,150
Genetically he is half Alpha.

456
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:27,074
But in terms
conditioning ...

457
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:28,676
... he's a blank slate.

458
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:29,691
Interesting.

459
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:32,835
But risky.
Don't you think?

460
00:33:32,835 --> 00:33:36,486
Introducing an unknown element
into our society.

461
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:39,820
is certainly something we labored
very hard to erradicate.

462
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,265
We have to explore the unknown

463
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:44,193
to make progress, sir.

464
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:46,107
Very well, Marx.

465
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:48,042
Continue with your study.

466
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,247
But if you don't mind,

467
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:53,288
I prefer you to report your findings
directly to me.

468
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:55,142
I don't mind at all, sir.

469
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,781
It'd be an honor.
Thank you.

470
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:25,800
You're moving up
in the world, Marx.

471
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:30,109
Congratulations.

472
00:35:12,181 --> 00:35:15,768
<i> Civilization has certainly had an effect
on savage John Cooper. </i>

473
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:18,247
<i> But what kind of effect has
he had on us? </i>

474
00:35:18,247 --> 00:35:20,286
<i> We have a special report from our...</i>

475
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:25,312
In five minutes we'll have a complete
genetic portrait of you.

476
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,142
I can hardly wait for you
to tell me all about myself.

477
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:32,280
We'll match it to the Alphas who worked
at the Border Center at the time of your conception...

478
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,100
...and identify your father.

479
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:36,840
Why would you wanna do that?

480
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:40,394
You don't want to find your father?

481
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,646
I thought family was
so important in your culture.

482
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:45,863
Bernard, what do you think a father is?

483
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:49,343
He's the man who contributes sperm
at a life's conception.

484
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:52,143
It takes a lot more than sperm
to make a man a father...

485
00:35:52,143 --> 00:35:55,713
A father sacrifices for his son:
he shows him who he is...

486
00:35:55,713 --> 00:35:58,756
And it helps him to be a man.

487
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:01,902
You have absolutely no idea of what
I'm talking about, do you?

488
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,260
No.

489
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,022
But it is interesting.

490
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:06,033
"Anomaly"

491
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:09,282
Adrenal secretions:
Normal.

492
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:12,436
Pulse peaking at 84.

493
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,653
<i>Celebrate yourself</i>

494
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:15,717
<i>You're unique. </i>

495
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,005
<i> No one is more unique than you. </i>

496
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:21,263
<i> You're special,
that's what makes us... </i>

497
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,253
<i> It doesn't matter what you look like. </i>

498
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:24,408
<i> We all look good. </i>

499
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:26,610
<i>It's what's inside that counts. </i>

500
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,633
<i> If you want it, you can have it. </i>

501
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:30,202
<i>Reach out, and grab it.</i>

502
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:33,342
<i>You deserve it,
you've earned it. </i>

503
00:36:33,342 --> 00:36:36,556
<i> If you like it, why not own it? </i>

504
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:39,442
Hello.

505
00:36:40,872 --> 00:36:43,335
I took Linda shopping.

506
00:36:43,983 --> 00:36:47,117
She's on a Soma holiday.

507
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,140
<i> Take me to the beach... </i>

508
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:55,729
<i>And tell me...</i>

509
00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:59,344
<i> ... you love me. </i>

510
00:37:04,438 --> 00:37:06,605
I should go.

511
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,309
I don't understand you two.

512
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,310
Why?

513
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:18,547
You're not married...

514
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:22,490
You say you're not lovers, but
there is obviously something going on between you.

515
00:37:22,495 --> 00:37:23,363
We are friends.

516
00:37:23,363 --> 00:37:25,579
It's not what I mean.

517
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,785
You're in love with her.

518
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:28,327
In love? That's quaint!

519
00:37:28,327 --> 00:37:30,936
Don't tell me there's no such thing
as love here, either?

520
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:34,937
You may say you love your favorite food,
or clothes or sport ...

521
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:38,351
... But you can't love another person.
That's possessive, selfish.

522
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:39,743
You really believe that?

523
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:40,746
I do.

524
00:37:40,746 --> 00:37:44,717
It's unhealthy all that emotion
focused on one person. Don't you think?

525
00:37:44,718 --> 00:37:45,718
No.

526
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:49,475
What if two women loved the same man,
or if two men loved the same woman?

527
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,988
You might fall in love with someone
who doesn't love you.

528
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:53,175
That's right!

529
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:57,423
Lenina should have as many men
as she pleases.

530
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,356
So... you're interested?

531
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,195
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.

532
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:07,475
I'm looking for the Savage.

533
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:09,795
I don't think this is a good time.

534
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:11,276
We'll wait.

535
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:20,500
Did you ever dream when you were stuck in
that horrible Reservation
that you would land here in Civilization?

536
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:23,565
I do not know ...
I never really thought about it.

537
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:26,450
I guess I always knew
I had a destiny.

538
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,765
"Destiny"?

539
00:38:27,766 --> 00:38:31,800
By this you mean your unusual
genetic makeup?

540
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,000
No, I don't think genetics
have anything to do with destiny

541
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You make your own

542
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,495
Genetics can't tell you who you are.

543
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:40,095
Fascinating.

544
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:41,215
Now tell me

545
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:45,000
What do you think
of civilized girls?

546
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:48,795
"Make your own destiny."

547
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:51,428
"No one else can tell you who you are."

548
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:57,378
That's the kind of antisocial misinformation
our citizens are forced to listen to thanks to the Savage.

549
00:38:57,378 --> 00:39:01,150
I believe the good Director
exagerates the dangers.

550
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:04,449
Surely our people are well enough conditioned
to recognize...

551
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:06,033
... Mr. Cooper's remarks as...

552
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,042
...quaint nonsense.

553
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,979
Why risk disturbance of the social order?
What purpose does it serve?

554
00:39:10,979 --> 00:39:14,200
Everywhere he goes,
he causes a public sensation.

555
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,756
Exactly.
People enjoy sensations, but...

556
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:22,337
... they also tire of them very quickly, which
I predict will happen with Mr. Cooper.

557
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:26,402
I asked Bernard Marx to be here today
since he's doing a study of the Savage.

558
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:29,837
Bernard, do you think
he poses a threat to the society?

559
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:31,588
If he sees things in a differently
from us...

560
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:33,012
... that's not dangerous.

561
00:39:33,012 --> 00:39:35,316
That's why he's a valuable
subject for research.

562
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:38,822
If he's going to stay, he must have
proper conditioning, as all of us have.

563
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:40,294
Isn't it a little late for that?.

564
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,295
It can be done.

565
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,100
With an accelerated intensive
program it can be done.

566
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,600
That will be valuable research.

567
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,009
You'll destroy everything
that makes him unique.

568
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:50,585
And ruin a great opportunity
for progress.

569
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:55,720
For the moment I don't see any harm in
allowing the Savage to remain here at his liberty...

570
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,786
...time will tell whether his presence here
will pose a serious problem.

571
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:08,482
We'll give people the chance to know,
to touch the real John Cooper...

572
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:12,339
To feel your heat.  My film will bring
them as close to you ...

573
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:14,562
...as I am now.

574
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:15,827
Excuse me.

575
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,000
Ah, John!

576
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:44,900
I've always supported this man's ideas.
No question is too controversial for us

577
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Right, Bernard?

578
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:56,250
What do these people want from me?

579
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,047
They've never met
anyone like you before.

580
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:01,666
You're mysterious.

581
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,043
They don't care who I am.
They just want to be entertained.

582
00:41:04,043 --> 00:41:06,331
I'm just a side-show attraction.

583
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,768
This world isn't what I expected.

584
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:11,803
What did you expect?

585
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:14,071
I do not know.

586
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,138
Respect for truth, beauty...
intelligence.

587
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:24,000
Instead it's just an endless
pursuit of pleasure.

588
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:28,702
We all have an unalienable
right to happiness.

589
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:29,821
Yeah, of course.

590
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:33,285
I would love it if you'd come
and speak to my class...

591
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,367
... about yourself.

592
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:39,301
They're very excited that
I know you.

593
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:40,461
All right.

594
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,200
Sorry, but I should go home.

595
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,000
John.

596
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:49,835
I feel like you avoid
being alone with me.

597
00:41:49,835 --> 00:41:51,563
No...

598
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
I don't mean to...

599
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,000
Good!

600
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:57,365
Good, good, and lovely.

601
00:41:57,365 --> 00:42:00,341
Let's go some place.

602
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,606
I've gotta go.

603
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,593
Give me personnel records for the
Savage Reservation Border Center.

604
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:14,594
Time range?

605
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:16,150
24 years ago.

606
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:17,500
One moment, please.

607
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Stop.

608
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,643
Delete the file!

609
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,308
Files cannot be deleted without...

610
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:29,452
My security clearance is
directorate level:

611
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:30,700
Delete it.

612
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:31,800
One moment please...

613
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,200
Deleting.

614
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,400
<i>Take a holiday from reality. </i>

615
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:50,957
You're telling me 
how to live my life?

616
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:58,313
I'm just saying that we're civilized:
for us sex is just another activity.

617
00:42:58,313 --> 00:43:01,914
But for John it can mean something else.

618
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:06,459
He might get the wrong idea.

619
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,907
I'm big girl, Bernard.

620
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,378
I think I understand what was
troubling you with your work...

621
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:00,992
...It seemed meaningless, unimportant.

622
00:44:00,992 --> 00:44:05,236
How would it be if you could do
something very important for society...

623
00:44:05,236 --> 00:44:10,659
Something that would stop a very bad person
from doing all us terrible harm?

624
00:44:13,257 --> 00:44:14,300
Yes?

625
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:15,514
Good.

626
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,637
I've designed a special conditioning program
just for you.

627
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,224
<i>Bernard Marx...
he hates you...l </i>

628
00:44:25,225 --> 00:44:29,000
<i> ...he deserves to die... </i>

629
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,806
<i>...kill...criminal...
antisocial... liar...</i>

630
00:44:34,307 --> 00:44:36,771
<i>laughing at you...
...destroy... kill... </i>

631
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:40,213
<i>Bernard Marx...
Bernard Marx... </i>

632
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,231
What?
What's your first impression?

633
00:45:10,232 --> 00:45:13,388
This place is a factory.

634
00:45:13,388 --> 00:45:16,684
You're turning out
human beings like machines.

635
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:18,260
Why?

636
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,204
To ensure each citizen
has the proper aptitude.

637
00:45:21,204 --> 00:45:23,826
And remove the danger and
the pain of child bearing.

638
00:45:23,826 --> 00:45:25,790
Danger and pain are a part of life.

639
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,901
If you try to run from them,
you're running from yourself.

640
00:45:27,901 --> 00:45:31,484
What's so great about pain?
It's a body signal that there's something wrong.

641
00:45:31,484 --> 00:45:35,171
Yes, sometimes. But at other times
it teaches us, initiates us ...

642
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:36,172
How?

643
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:41,658
The pain of child birth initiates
a woman into motherhood.

644
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:45,632
When a baby is born, it screams,
sings to the world that its soul is alive.

645
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:48,205
What about their souls?

646
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:50,237
"Souls"?

647
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:52,109
Come on!

648
00:45:53,273 --> 00:45:56,097
Bernard, why did you bring me here?

649
00:45:56,097 --> 00:46:01,274
Why all these notes, why all these tests?
Everything here was supposed to be perfect.

650
00:46:01,274 --> 00:46:03,753
We have our problems too.

651
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:08,731
But with your help, I can design programs
and that'll give people happier lives.

652
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:13,619
So you want me to help you figure out
how to make people happier?

653
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,650
Yes.

654
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,300
<i>Kill Bernard Marx...kill... </i>

655
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,559
<i> He's a monster...
a degenerate... </i>

656
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,813
Good luck.

657
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,926
Are you sure?

658
00:46:57,926 --> 00:47:03,125
I don't know how much more clearly I can put it:
There-are-no-matches.

659
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,237
Check again.

660
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:08,671
The DNA sample I gave you's got to match
one of the Reservation officers at that time.

661
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,362
I have checked.

662
00:47:11,222 --> 00:47:12,278
And it doesn't.

663
00:47:12,278 --> 00:47:14,196
Have you examined every possibility?

664
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:16,088
Are you saying I'm incompetent?

665
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:17,745
Would you like to file a complaint?

666
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:20,500
No, I'm saying we have
to find a match.

667
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,108
There was one small ...
irregularity.

668
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:27,519
A discrepancy between the file manifest
and the actual number of records I found.

669
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:29,701
There seems to be a file missing.

670
00:47:29,701 --> 00:47:31,292
That must be it!

671
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:32,293
Can you try to locate it?

672
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:34,339
No.

673
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,147
You know what kind of backlog
we have here?

674
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,514
You think we Betas have
nothing better to do..?

675
00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:40,701
Of course not.

676
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:43,018
What'd we do without you?

677
00:47:43,018 --> 00:47:47,541
Where would we be without the efficiency
you Betas demonstrate every day?

678
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:48,900
All right.

679
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:51,755
Check back on Monday.

680
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,150
Two households, both alike in dignity.
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene.

681
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:01,710
From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny
where civil war makes civil hands unclean...

682
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:07,273
From forth two fatal loines of these two foes,
a pair of star-crossed lovers, take their life...

683
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:12,602
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- I do bite my thumb, sir.

684
00:48:12,394 --> 00:48:21,481
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun...

685
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:26,128
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name...

686
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:31,367
O happy dagger!... This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die...

687
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:36,048
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished...

688
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:43,413
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

689
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:47,351
So that's Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare,
the greatest writer who ever lived.

690
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:49,027
What's so great about him?

691
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:53,379
I didn't understand it.  Was it in
a dead language like French or German?

692
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:55,729
What's it about?

693
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,884
Romeo and Juliet are...
a boy and girl...

694
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:02,250
about your age...

695
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,465
... Maybe a little older...

696
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,651
... and they're in love!

697
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:08,395
But their families are enemies.

698
00:49:08,396 --> 00:49:09,868
In love with what?

699
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:12,467
With each other.

700
00:49:13,676 --> 00:49:19,300
Haven't you ever wanted something with all your heart
and you just couldn't have it?

701
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:25,450
Once I really wanted this cute green
polyester jacket with a fake fur collar...

702
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:28,323
I had to wait for two whole weeks
before I could get one.

703
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,387
That was horrible.

704
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:33,269
What happens at the end?

705
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:36,552
Romeo and Juliet commit suicide
rather than be apart.

706
00:49:36,552 --> 00:49:40,875
That's silly.  They can't have each other
so they kill themselves?

707
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:43,870
It is not about sex,
it's about love.

708
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,158
Don't you know what that is?

709
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:46,198
Feeling...

710
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:47,735
passion...

711
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,712
Worth suffering for,
worth dying for?

712
00:50:01,026 --> 00:50:03,938
I'm sorry. I should've prepared them.

713
00:50:05,256 --> 00:50:08,251
The language is interesting, but...

714
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:10,208
... the stories are very outdated.

715
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:12,119
The stories aren't outdated.

716
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,736
They're just incapable of understanding them.

717
00:50:14,736 --> 00:50:19,966
You take anything that means anything,
and you tell them that it's nothing.

718
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,624
What would you want me to tell them...

719
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:28,599
...that people are better off living
in fear and violence?

720
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,725
"The seeming truth which cunning times
put on to entrap the wisest..."

721
00:50:33,476 --> 00:50:37,604
Do you think that people are better off
living like you do in a reservation?

722
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:40,453
No, no. You people ...

723
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:44,388
... you want so much,
you want everything, you devour everything...

724
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:45,999
You're trying to fill some hole.

725
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,496
I don't understand.

726
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:48,497
Explain it to me.

727
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:49,700
I can't.

728
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,871
John, I want to understand.

729
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,630
John?

730
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:01,621
What this world does
to all of you...

731
00:51:01,621 --> 00:51:05,436
I wish I could get through somehow.

732
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:48,879
What are you doing?

733
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,798
What's wrong?

734
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,532
This is not how you feel about me.

735
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:57,200
That's not true.

736
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:00,000
Not true.

737
00:52:01,588 --> 00:52:03,204
I wish.

738
00:52:05,882 --> 00:52:07,993
You like me.

739
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:10,200
You like me, don't you?

740
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,200
Since first I saw you.

741
00:52:17,732 --> 00:52:20,197
I want to understand ...
to feel...

742
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:22,470
... the passion.

743
00:52:24,216 --> 00:52:25,544
Lenina.

744
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,408
This is not love.

745
00:53:07,616 --> 00:53:09,171
Linda?

746
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:13,084
We should've never come here.
Everything here is false.

747
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:16,969
But you're not even here anymore.

748
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,278
Mother?

749
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:39,539
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.

750
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:44,611
Catatonic eye reflexes...

751
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:48,350
Her body's not accustomed
to that much Soma.

752
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,826
Is she gonna live?

753
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:51,303
It's hard to say.

754
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:54,447
I've never seen someone in
such a poor physical condition.

755
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,749
You can go.
We'll call you.

756
00:53:58,784 --> 00:54:01,085
I'm not going anywhere.
She is my mother.

757
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:03,047
So we've all heard.

758
00:54:03,464 --> 00:54:06,129
Still you have no business being here.

759
00:54:06,129 --> 00:54:08,226
This is a hospital.

760
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,877
You don't have to stay
if it makes you uncomfortable.

761
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,867
Let's go.

762
00:55:10,562 --> 00:55:12,800
<i> Sadness is an illusion ...</i>

763
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,000
<i> ...only happiness is real. </i>

764
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:23,500
John.

765
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:25,995
John.

766
00:55:48,788 --> 00:55:50,414
Thank you for staying.

767
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:51,900
You're welcome.

768
00:55:56,502 --> 00:55:59,996
Seeing with your mother ...

769
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:06,129
... didn't seem so bad.

770
00:56:07,186 --> 00:56:09,282
It was really quite beautiful.

771
00:56:10,232 --> 00:56:13,046
She drives me crazy most of the time.

772
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:17,582
I can't blame her for drinking.

773
00:56:18,046 --> 00:56:20,757
Or trying to avoid reality.

774
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:25,230
After I was born ...

775
00:56:25,861 --> 00:56:29,374
People treated her
like a whore.

776
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:32,453
Men used her.

777
00:56:39,527 --> 00:56:41,700
And you were just a child.

778
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:44,887
I imagine that...

779
00:56:44,887 --> 00:56:48,080
...you must've felt so helpless.

780
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,850
It's late...
You're tired and upset.

781
00:57:12,854 --> 00:57:16,834
Stay, please.

782
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:52,085
Do we need more evidence than this
of the Savage's destructive effect?

783
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:54,846
It's nothing but a fad,
a harmless little cult.

784
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,806
So was Christianity at first.

785
00:57:57,806 --> 00:58:02,454
Mr. Marx, any success in identifying
the Savage's father?

786
00:58:02,455 --> 00:58:03,600
No, Controller, not yet.

787
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Of course not.

788
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,934
Because the Savage made the story up.

789
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:11,390
For all we know, Mr. Marx colluted in the lie
to advance his own career.

790
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,000
Are you alone?

791
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,001
Yes, come in.

792
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Come in.

793
00:58:32,188 --> 00:58:33,622
What's the matter?

794
00:58:33,622 --> 00:58:35,973
Things aren't going so well.

795
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:38,680
Sorry.

796
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,761
All this with the DHC, Mond, and John ...

797
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:47,856
I tried to make things better,
make a mark for myself, but now...

798
00:58:48,328 --> 00:58:55,338
I'm begining to think this world's built on a lie...
Once you see that, it all starts to cumble.

799
00:58:55,339 --> 00:58:56,339
What lie?

800
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,144
That we've eliminated unhappiness,
or that we ever could.

801
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:04,081
What's going on with you and John?.

802
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:09,002
I don't know.

803
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:14,000
He makes me feel ...

804
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,558
...something that I never felt before.

805
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:20,580
He makes me feel needed.

806
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,378
How do I make you feel?

807
00:59:31,379 --> 00:59:33,910
It is not the same thing.

808
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,494
You don't need anybody, Bernard.

809
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:40,917
You do fine on your own.

810
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,011
I'm starting to understand why
we've got little flaws.

811
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:05,350
I don't think we ever did.

812
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:25,476
<i>Hug me till you drug me, honey...</i>

813
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:29,084
<i>Kiss me till I'm in a coma...</i>

814
01:00:29,085 --> 01:00:31,024
<i>Hug me, honey...</i>

815
01:00:31,024 --> 01:00:33,656
<i>Snuggly Bunny...</i>

816
01:00:33,656 --> 01:00:37,519
<i> Sex is good, is soma...</i>

817
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,915
<i>Squeeze me, sugar...</i>

818
01:00:49,222 --> 01:00:50,250
What have we got?

819
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,840
I've done everything I can.

820
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,102
Whose ever file was...
It simply no longer exists.

821
01:00:54,102 --> 01:00:56,286
How can that be?
It's a bureaucratic foul up?

822
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:58,482
Bureaucrats don't foul up.

823
01:00:58,482 --> 01:00:59,923
Systems do.

824
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,589
That file had to be...

825
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:04,342
...purposely deleted.

826
01:01:04,342 --> 01:01:05,711
Is that possible?

827
01:01:05,712 --> 01:01:08,300
If someone had high enough clearance? Yes.

828
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,948
I've really got to get that record.

829
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:10,949
Read my lips:

830
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:11,950
It's gone.

831
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:18,487
Are you experiencing dissatisfaction?

832
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:24,494
I already regret saying this, but...

833
01:01:24,494 --> 01:01:27,861
...there might be cross indexes in other departments...
I can check.

834
01:01:27,861 --> 01:01:29,407
That would be helpful.

835
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:30,408
It's my pleasure.

836
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:00,700
Please don't...

837
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,714
Please ...

838
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,701
I'm glad I'm a Delta.

839
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,400
Glad I'm a Delta.

840
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,084
Re-engineering?

841
01:02:30,084 --> 01:02:31,737
It's Bernard Marx.

842
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:34,256
Send a Core
Retrieval Unit quickly.

843
01:02:34,257 --> 01:02:36,590
You've got a crashed Delta here.

844
01:02:38,742 --> 01:02:42,162
I don't know how else I can put it.
These records are classified.

845
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:45,798
I'm asking you to make an exception.

846
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:47,393
But that's subversive.

847
01:02:47,393 --> 01:02:48,926
It is but isn't it?

848
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:35,907
You came back to me!

849
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:47,364
Why... why are you looking at me...

850
01:03:47,364 --> 01:03:49,955
...like that?

851
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:55,568
It's upsetting...

852
01:03:55,568 --> 01:03:57,296
I'm sorry...

853
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:03,700
Turn up your Soma if
you're upset.

854
01:04:39,315 --> 01:04:41,294
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.

855
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:42,600
Linda Cooper?.

856
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,000
Yes, this way.

857
01:04:54,736 --> 01:04:57,887
What's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?

858
01:04:57,888 --> 01:05:02,002
You'll make children think
that death is something sad...

859
01:05:02,003 --> 01:05:04,426
...we're trying to teach them.

860
01:05:04,427 --> 01:05:05,427
Her life is over ...

861
01:05:05,428 --> 01:05:09,296
...but it's OK because everyone
else is allive and happy.

862
01:05:09,296 --> 01:05:13,343
We can recycle her organs,
and reclaim the phosphorus.

863
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:17,684
OK, Come on!
Chocolates, candy!

864
01:05:18,757 --> 01:05:20,621
Is she dead?

865
01:05:20,622 --> 01:05:22,573
She's weird.

866
01:05:22,574 --> 01:05:24,389
Look at her teeth!

867
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:28,500
She is my mother.
Get out of here!

868
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:33,458
Stop it.

869
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:36,898
One dead person can't
matter that much!

870
01:05:36,898 --> 01:05:38,914
You're upsetting
the children.

871
01:05:38,947 --> 01:05:42,188
"... of comfort no man speak:...

872
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:45,009
...let's talk of graves, and worms
and epitaphs;...

873
01:05:45,009 --> 01:05:50,000
...make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth..."

874
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,514
He's silly!

875
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:11,791
"O, Brave New World
that has such people in it."

876
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:16,382
What are you
doing to yourself?

877
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:19,589
It doesn't make you happy:
just enslaves you.

878
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,890
You're not happy!

879
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:21,591
You're just...

880
01:06:21,592 --> 01:06:23,669
Believe in yourselves!

881
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,062
Find out who you are!

882
01:06:25,062 --> 01:06:28,430
Throw the drug away.
Throw it all away!

883
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:36,527
- Put that down!
- Throw it away!

884
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:45,772
Throw it away!
Wake up!

885
01:06:45,972 --> 01:06:46,995
Wake up!

886
01:06:46,996 --> 01:06:48,990
- Look at you've done!
- Wake up!

887
01:06:55,046 --> 01:06:58,021
We're learning more tonight
about the bizarre occurrance

888
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,922
at a Soma Distribution Center
earlier this evening.

889
01:07:00,121 --> 01:07:01,537
John Cooper seems to have...

890
01:07:01,537 --> 01:07:06,219
The Savage is apparently
distraught over the death of his...

891
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,603
the woman who...

892
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:10,409
Can I say 'mother'?

893
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:13,807
I don't care what he did it.
He should be made an example of...

894
01:07:13,807 --> 01:07:17,461
We need to show him some compassion.
After all he is only a savage.

895
01:07:17,462 --> 01:07:19,749
This should never
have happened!

896
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,966
I warned you not to let that
savage run loose...

897
01:07:21,966 --> 01:07:24,466
With all due respect, sir.
John is not the problem.

898
01:07:24,466 --> 01:07:27,225
If the Deltas are out of control,
it's our responsibility.

899
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:30,583
Marx, the Deltas are not out of control.
The problem lies with the Savage.

900
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,000
<i>Agreed!</i>

901
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:33,049
I demand his immediate
Re-engineering.

902
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:35,434
Sir, you mustn't allow
this to happen.

903
01:07:35,434 --> 01:07:40,611
"Politics is the art
of the possible," Bernard.

904
01:07:40,612 --> 01:07:43,066
We can't afford
this kind of disorder.

905
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:45,548
What are you saying,
Controller?

906
01:07:45,548 --> 01:07:49,227
We have to be prepared
to make sacrifices.

907
01:08:03,692 --> 01:08:05,970
Mr. Marx...

908
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:07,845
I've been looking all over
for you...

909
01:08:07,845 --> 01:08:10,965
You're not going to believe
what I found.

910
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:18,463
Thank you.

911
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:27,100
The time has come
for a decision.

912
01:08:37,331 --> 01:08:39,370
Excuse me...

913
01:08:39,371 --> 01:08:43,500
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but before we go any further...

914
01:08:44,619 --> 01:08:48,100
...there's another matter
brought to my attention...

915
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:56,654
The question everyone is asking:
How could this happen?

916
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:59,440
Disgusting!
Absolutely sickening.

917
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,285
How a man in his position
could have a baby?

918
01:09:04,986 --> 01:09:07,293
The question isn't
"Why he did it?"

919
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:08,860
He should be made
an example of...

920
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,020
Clearly I would argue
compassion in this case...

921
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,397
Compassion does not fit
into the equation.

922
01:09:13,397 --> 01:09:15,039
<i> The DHC is...</i>

923
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:17,831
<i> There's still no indication as to
what will be done with the Savage </i>

924
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:19,550
I never should've
brought you here.

925
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,418
When the Controller beckons,
we all have to jump!

926
01:09:22,418 --> 01:09:25,655
I mean to Civilization.
That was a mistake.

927
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:28,249
I'm sorry.

928
01:09:29,564 --> 01:09:35,500
It's nice to know a man born
in a bottle can have a soul.

929
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,322
So...

930
01:09:49,412 --> 01:09:53,350
I understand you don't care much
for Civilization, Mr. Cooper.

931
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:54,677
No.

932
01:09:55,262 --> 01:10:01,550
It seemed great at first.
All so pretty and clean...all that music...

933
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:08,175
"Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will come about my ears...

934
01:10:08,175 --> 01:10:10,517
...and sometimes voices. "

935
01:10:10,517 --> 01:10:11,950
That's...

936
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:13,569
"Othello."

937
01:10:13,604 --> 01:10:16,156
Why can't everyone
read Shakespeare?

938
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:17,200
Anyone can.

939
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,184
But why would the want to?

940
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:21,212
It wouldn't mean anything
to them.

941
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:24,262
Our world isn't Shakespeare's,
you know?

942
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:26,432
Great tragedy...

943
01:10:26,432 --> 01:10:30,468
All great art causes
passion, conflict...

944
01:10:30,468 --> 01:10:31,722
... social instability.

945
01:10:31,723 --> 01:10:33,717
We don't have any
of that anymore.

946
01:10:33,717 --> 01:10:34,950
People are happy.

947
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,104
Happy at what cost?

948
01:10:36,104 --> 01:10:40,843
At the cost of art, religion,
philosophy, love, science...

949
01:10:40,843 --> 01:10:42,044
-Science?

950
01:10:42,044 --> 01:10:45,001
But we're conditioned to believe
that science is everything.

951
01:10:45,002 --> 01:10:49,333
Not true science, Bernard.
Just technology that serves public order.

952
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:54,315
"Increase consumption."
"Prevent dissatisfaction."

953
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:55,316
You know?

954
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,555
I was a pretty fair chemist
when I was young.

955
01:10:58,556 --> 01:11:01,746
And I developed an interest
in "pure research."

956
01:11:01,747 --> 01:11:03,364
Well...

957
01:11:03,364 --> 01:11:06,696
... I was nearly
Re-Engineered for it.

958
01:11:06,697 --> 01:11:09,422
I was a lot like you, Bernard,
I had a choice to make:

959
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:13,105
I loved science.
But I chose to sacrifice that.

960
01:11:13,105 --> 01:11:16,613
To serve the public happiness,
and not my own.

961
01:11:16,613 --> 01:11:18,659
So truth is
another price you pay?

962
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:19,859
Truth?

963
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,806
There was plenty of talk of truth
and beauty before the Wars...

964
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:26,550
...while men were devising new ways
to destroy each other.

965
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,805
It was horrible.

966
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:33,248
But most historical facts
are unpleasant, aren't they?

967
01:11:33,249 --> 01:11:35,769
What about John, sir?

968
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:39,620
Nothing.
Nothing happens to him.

969
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:42,542
John is the exception
that proves the rule.

970
01:11:42,543 --> 01:11:48,139
He's the proof that our system is so stable,
we can tolerate a Savage in our midst.

971
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,050
If here were banished, or Re-engineered,
some people might ask...

972
01:11:52,051 --> 01:11:55,495
"Are we missing something?"
No!

973
01:11:55,495 --> 01:12:00,262
In this brave new world we can all
have whatever we like.

974
01:12:00,297 --> 01:12:02,047
And personally...

975
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,541
...I like him.

976
01:12:06,766 --> 01:12:11,900
The World Controller, Mustapha Mond,
announced tonight that a...

977
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:15,520
...full pardon will be granted
to the Savage.

978
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:21,477
The Law demands punitive Re-engineering
of our former DHC...

979
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:30,811
Lenina.

980
01:12:33,344 --> 01:12:35,082
Lenina!

981
01:12:42,477 --> 01:12:45,233
Lenina, I need to talk to you.

982
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:47,541
I'm leaving!

983
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:51,306
<i> What is the Savage thinking? </i>

984
01:12:51,306 --> 01:12:52,834
<i> "...I want to be alone." </i>

985
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:56,412
<i>After Controller Mond gave
social immunity to John Cooper ..</i>

986
01:12:56,412 --> 01:12:59,212
<i> is this his latest snub at
Civilization?</i>

987
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:01,210
<i>Stay tuned for
more details.</i>

988
01:13:15,043 --> 01:13:17,500
<i> Where exactly is John Cooper?</i>

989
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,000
<i> Everyone wants to know. </i>

990
01:13:41,343 --> 01:13:44,220
<i>Wondering why you haven't seen
the Savage lately?</i>

991
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,720
<i>It's because he hasn't been here.</i>

992
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,854
<i> "We'll show you when the news continue...
"Stay tuned for more details...</i>

993
01:13:49,855 --> 01:13:52,069
<i> There's more when we come back...</i>

994
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:56,694
<i>Authorities say it is
difficult to imagine anyone...</i>

995
01:13:56,694 --> 01:14:00,441
<i> ...choosing to isolate himself...
but John Cooper has done just that.</i>

996
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:03,906
<i> You're looking at an abandoned
microwave tower...</i>

997
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:06,867
<i>There's more to come...</i>

998
01:14:06,868 --> 01:14:12,694
<i>Researchers told us that the Savage
has been confused and irrational...</i>

999
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:16,742
<i> More of this story when we come back...</i>

1000
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,004
<i> It's fun to look at, but
do we really understand?</i>

1001
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,834
John, why did you leave?

1002
01:14:22,835 --> 01:14:24,909
No! Go away!

1003
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:29,176
<i>Reports say he is suffering
from Soma withdrawal...</i>

1004
01:14:29,176 --> 01:14:32,532
<i> Our team reports that
the Savage has never taken Soma...</i>

1005
01:14:32,532 --> 01:14:34,838
<i>and this may explain his irrational...</i>

1006
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:40,389
<i> Now that we know where he is,
the question everybody's asking is...</i>

1007
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:42,311
<i> "When is he coming back?"</i>

1008
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:44,876
<i> Authorities say they still
have no idea...</i>

1009
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:46,593
<i> We have a special report...</i>

1010
01:14:46,594 --> 01:14:48,900
<i> How he got to this abandoned tower...</i>

1011
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:54,142
<i>Delta workers working outside a plant
claim to have seen a man...</i>

1012
01:14:54,143 --> 01:14:57,877
<i>John Cooper, our Savage,
takes a holiday from reality...</i>

1013
01:14:57,878 --> 01:14:59,000
<i> ...But without Soma. </i>

1014
01:14:59,001 --> 01:15:03,322
<i> We return now to Pamela March
reporting live from the Pre-War tower...</i>

1015
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,840
<i>There are a lot of questions
that remain unanswered... </i>

1016
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:28,875
<i>...a series of strange incidents
sorrounding the Savage...</i>

1017
01:15:28,876 --> 01:15:33,809
<i> Conditioning experts don't know
the effects this could have on our society...</i>

1018
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:37,859
<i>...have told us the Savage has been
confused and irrational...</i>

1019
01:15:39,184 --> 01:15:41,156
He's over there!

1020
01:15:44,934 --> 01:15:46,713
He's down there!

1021
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,022
<i> John, wait!</i>

1022
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:11,884
What do you want?

1023
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:13,931
What do you want from me?

1024
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:16,357
I have nothing to give you.

1025
01:16:16,358 --> 01:16:19,549
What about you, John?
What do you want?

1026
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:22,311
I want... pain.

1027
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:24,533
I want freedom.

1028
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:26,308
I want goodness.

1029
01:16:26,308 --> 01:16:27,360
I want evil.

1030
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,559
I want sin.

1031
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,253
I want...
love!

1032
01:16:31,557 --> 01:16:33,095
John!

1033
01:16:38,338 --> 01:16:40,094
"I went into the woods...

1034
01:16:40,094 --> 01:16:45,022
...because I wanted to breathe deep
and suck all the marrow out of life...

1035
01:16:45,023 --> 01:16:47,590
...to put to rout all that
was not life...

1036
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:52,459
...and not when it came time to die,
to discover that I had not lived."

1037
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:55,000
"To be awake is to be alive."

1038
01:17:09,636 --> 01:17:13,000
<i>We've got the whole
thing on tape...</i>

1039
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:57,803
<i>I need you.</i>

1040
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:06,044
<i> I want you.</i>

1041
01:18:07,813 --> 01:18:10,080
<i> I want you.</i>

1042
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:15,600
<i> I love you. </i>

1043
01:18:29,657 --> 01:18:31,792
Yes?

1044
01:18:36,448 --> 01:18:38,589
All right!

1045
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,855
Mond wants me.

1046
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:03,100
I have to go.

1047
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:23,800
The confirmation hearing for
Bernard Marx as DHC continues...

1048
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:26,928
Please tell me if it's satisfactory.

1049
01:19:28,704 --> 01:19:30,522
A bit of a change?

1050
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:33,736
Adjusting to the lifestyle
of Director?

1051
01:19:34,287 --> 01:19:37,000
I suppose I can make
the sacrifice.

1052
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:42,734
Are you still having Lenina Crowne
from Educational Conditioning?

1053
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:45,548
I hardly have time for anyone, sir.

1054
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:50,250
I wonder if we can discuss some of my
ideas about reforming the Conditioning Dept.

1055
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,389
That might be rushing
things a bit.

1056
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:56,190
First we have to ensure
your appointment clears the Directory...

1057
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,700
And that might take a little massaging.

1058
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:01,850
Once that's done...
Then...

1059
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:10,936
I suggest creating a committee that
can report on the advisability of reform...

1060
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:13,263
That can take a long time.

1061
01:20:13,418 --> 01:20:17,107
It's best to err on the side
of caution, Bernard.

1062
01:20:17,107 --> 01:20:18,771
Yes.

1063
01:20:18,771 --> 01:20:21,122
I'm very pleased with
your success, Bernard.

1064
01:20:21,122 --> 01:20:23,824
I meant it when I said
I was like you when I was young.

1065
01:20:24,812 --> 01:20:28,653
We can almost be from
the same gland extract.

1066
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:31,650
Well.

1067
01:20:31,698 --> 01:20:34,052
Have some fun,
be happy.

1068
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:38,273
Don't deny yourself anything.

1069
01:20:46,793 --> 01:20:49,315
The ancient Greeks...

1070
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:53,414
...worshipped men of sacrifice and action,
whom they called heroes.

1071
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:56,142
As Civilization progressed,

1072
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,881
...the world of heroes became...

1073
01:20:58,882 --> 01:21:01,982
...more and more...
irrelevant.

1074
01:21:16,297 --> 01:21:19,763
Now we know that
heroism is really...

1075
01:21:19,763 --> 01:21:22,560
... Antisocial behaviour.

1076
01:21:22,569 --> 01:21:26,330
But necessary in the old...

1077
01:21:27,628 --> 01:21:30,368
... And imperfect world.

1078
01:21:33,572 --> 01:21:35,761
Because...

1079
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:42,251
Heroes...change things.

1080
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:45,985
We're not supposed to want
anything to change.

1081
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:50,447
Heroes mean that one person
can make a difference.

1082
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:53,714
- Miss Crowne?
-Yes?

1083
01:21:53,715 --> 01:21:56,892
I don't see that in the book.

1084
01:21:57,143 --> 01:21:59,033
It's not in the book.

1085
01:21:59,421 --> 01:22:02,920
Are you saying that the
textbook is wrong?

1086
01:22:02,921 --> 01:22:03,921
Well ...

1087
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:08,195
What do you think?

1088
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:09,499
How would I know?

1089
01:22:09,534 --> 01:22:15,068
I don't know more than this textbook.
Neither do you. You're just one person.

1090
01:22:15,068 --> 01:22:18,668
Who do you think you are?

1091
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:22,417
Nobody.

1092
01:22:35,293 --> 01:22:36,726
Yes?

1093
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:40,000
I'm Lenina Crowne,
Bernard wanted to see me.

1094
01:22:40,713 --> 01:22:44,269
Yes, the DHC elect
will see you.

1095
01:22:50,002 --> 01:22:52,646
How are you?

1096
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:13,063
What do you want?

1097
01:23:13,064 --> 01:23:17,788
To see you. Catch up.
Find out how you've been.

1098
01:23:19,005 --> 01:23:21,436
All right, we'll get
straight to it...

1099
01:23:21,436 --> 01:23:24,791
I have some negative feedback
from the students...

1100
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,612
I'm on your side.

1101
01:23:26,612 --> 01:23:30,947
Together we can avoid this
negatively impacting you.

1102
01:23:30,948 --> 01:23:32,500
Bernard...

1103
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:35,191
It's not important.

1104
01:23:35,191 --> 01:23:37,199
I'm afraid it is, Len.

1105
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:40,901
I know, you wanted to make a difference,
but what difference can you make?

1106
01:23:40,902 --> 01:23:43,124
I'm in a position to help you...

1107
01:23:43,124 --> 01:23:45,732
You can't help me,
it's too late.

1108
01:23:45,732 --> 01:23:48,409
No, it's not too late.

1109
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,541
I'm pregnant.

1110
01:23:55,593 --> 01:23:58,544
Really?
-Yes.

1111
01:24:02,768 --> 01:24:04,429
Pregnant?

1112
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:08,141
The night that John died I didn't
use my birth control.

1113
01:24:09,752 --> 01:24:12,225
I'm carrying your baby.

1114
01:24:12,951 --> 01:24:14,544
My baby?

1115
01:24:16,889 --> 01:24:18,920
My baby?

1116
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:24,500
First we'll say
it was an accident.

1117
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,953
That you thought you'd taken your birth control...
-No, Bernard...

1118
01:24:28,954 --> 01:24:31,957
-I wanna have this child...
- It's impossible, it's illegal...

1119
01:24:31,957 --> 01:24:33,086
- I know.
-No.

1120
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:35,028
Then they're going to
have to kill me.

1121
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:38,249
Perhaps they will and find something
equally suitable for me?

1122
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:43,727
They'll never put up with another
DHC as a father...

1123
01:24:43,728 --> 01:24:45,401
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1124
01:24:45,401 --> 01:24:48,195
- But you're certain on doing this?
-Yes.

1125
01:24:48,196 --> 01:24:50,149
Yes, I am.

1126
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:58,076
I'll get you out.

1127
01:25:02,252 --> 01:25:05,800
It is the only way
you can have the child.

1128
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:11,343
-Thank you.
-Understand you'll be on your own...

1129
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:16,778
You can never come back.

1130
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:19,283
I understand.

1131
01:25:22,134 --> 01:25:25,600
And you still get to be DHC.

1132
01:25:29,633 --> 01:25:32,225
I am so sorry.

1133
01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:46,522
I'm sorry too.

1134
01:25:47,455 --> 01:25:51,142
<i>Banishment meant going
beyond the Badlands</i>

1135
01:25:51,142 --> 01:25:57,239
<i> To a place where people were too self-consciously
individual to fit into Civilization</i>

1136
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,490
Why wasn't this man made
head of the Department before?

1137
01:26:00,491 --> 01:26:04,163
We think our conditions are
improving tremendously.

1138
01:26:04,163 --> 01:26:05,562
I'll drink to that.

1139
01:26:05,563 --> 01:26:09,254
I sort of miss the old man,
you know.

1140
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,005
"Let me impregnate you."

1141
01:26:12,686 --> 01:26:14,000
"I want to be a father!"

1142
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,387
"I want to be a father!"

1143
01:26:26,109 --> 01:26:27,500
Great.

1144
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,465
Life was very different
before the Wars.

1145
01:26:33,466 --> 01:26:36,443
It wasn't until the
world was unified...

1146
01:26:36,443 --> 01:26:42,772
...under a rational, scientifically enlightened
government that real progress could occur.

1147
01:26:42,772 --> 01:26:45,926
And now we live in luxury,
safety, and harmony.

1148
01:26:45,926 --> 01:26:49,412
Could there be a better time
to be alive?

1149
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:52,386
<i> Celebrate yourself.
You are unique. </i>

1150
01:26:52,386 --> 01:26:54,226
<i> No one is more unique than you. </i>

1151
01:26:54,226 --> 01:26:56,162
<i>It doesn't matter
what you look like.</i>

1152
01:26:56,162 --> 01:26:57,898
<i> We all look good.</i>

1153
01:26:57,899 --> 01:27:00,293
<i>It's what's inside
that counts.</i>

1154
01:27:00,293 --> 01:27:01,829
<i> But looking good is important. </i>

1155
01:27:01,864 --> 01:27:04,420
<i> The better you look,
the better you feel. </i>

1156
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,584
<i>It's important to feel good. </i>

1157
01:27:06,584 --> 01:27:09,525
<i> If we look good,
we are good.</i>

1158
01:27:09,526 --> 01:27:11,775
<i> If you want it,
you can have it.</i>

1159
01:27:11,775 --> 01:27:13,358
<i> Reach out and grab it!</i>

1160
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:17,314
<i>You deserve it.
Celebrate yourself.</i>

1161
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:24,977
<i> Let the world say, "Thank you"
with Soma.</i>

1162
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:31,800
- Are the Directors assembled?.
- Yes, sir.

1163
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,800
Where's Marx?

1164
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:38,699
What is this?

1165
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:42,700
"Sincere apologies.
Regret I cannot attend."

1166
01:27:42,701 --> 01:27:43,700
Where the hell is he?

1167
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,014
Sir, apparently,
he authorized a trip.

1168
01:27:47,014 --> 01:27:52,100
He gave Security the impression
that you were aware.

1169
01:28:33,783 --> 01:28:37,396
<i> There is a place,
and a purpose for everyone. </i>

1170
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:39,755
<i> So everyone is happy. </i>

1171
01:28:39,755 --> 01:28:44,761
<i>And we all have fun:
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta...</i>

1172
01:28:44,761 --> 01:28:46,983
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else.</i>

1173
01:28:46,983 --> 01:28:51,311
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>

1174
01:28:51,311 --> 01:28:53,058
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>

1175
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:55,186
<i>I am so glad I'm an Alpha...</i>

1176
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:58,449
<i> I'd hate to be a dull as a
Delta...</i>
