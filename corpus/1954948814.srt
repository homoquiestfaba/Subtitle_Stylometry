you had two years...

We understand that she has not
been taking her medication...

And therefore...

30
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,384

didn't help her then...

from headaches at the time...

To consult on this rather
remarkable case.

99
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:51,011

take a look...

101
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,851

take her back to the hospital.

you know...

to the authorities.

For many years
in the United States...

114
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,091
And when we heard
about this case...

115
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,294
We realized that it might be
the perfect opportunity...

116
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,931
To study something
in the field...

117
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:48,201
Which is rather difficult
to find test subjects for.

118
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,505
In this case,
what I believe is happening...

119
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:57,044
Is a perfect case...

120
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,713
A psychotic state...

121
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,382
Often that resembles
schizophrenia...

122
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,153
With all the associated
manifestations of that.

123
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,321
It presents
in exactly the same way...

124
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,157
As classic schizophrenia...

125
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,693
But we believe
it's directly related...

126
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,662
To seizure activity.

127
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:21,635

And we're...
at the invite of Dr. Gruber.

132
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,015
And I think the reason
we've come this whole way...

133
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,785
Is because there appears
to be things happening here...

134

encountered before.

Anneliese appeared...

147
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,698
And proceeded to urinate
on the floor...

her own urine.

She's seizing.
Give me your stethoscope.

your stethoscope now.

Ok, 20 milligrams Diazepam.
We're going to sedate her.

to sedate her quickly.

Renz, we are rolling.

Let me interrupt you.

I am a father,

They have served
their purpose.

236
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:11,278
They had over two...
almost three years...

and to try their art.

I am not against medicine...

240
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,590
It has its place.

241
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,459
It has outlived
its usefulness.

242
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,328
We've seen some pretty
trippy things.

243
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:31,598
How does a demon do that?

244
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,534
How does a demon
manifest normally?

245
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,937
It could be as simple
as speaking in tongues.

246
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,507
All of a sudden,
the person uses language...

247
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,943

We have had instances
where all of a sudden...

249
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,247
The person speaks Aramaic.

250
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:51,884
That is the language...

251
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:55,588
We barely have any written
language from that time.

252
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,891
Anneliese, she grew up
in a small Bavarian village.

253
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:02,329
How could she speak Greek,
fluent Latin...

254
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,464
English even, or Italian?

255
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:07,867
How could she do that?

256
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,336

This is definitely demonic.

260
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,591
These are manifestations,
outbursts...

Where the demon
wants to manifest itself...

To the people around.

263
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,264
It's, for lack
of a better word...

264
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,666
A scare tactic.

what's happening to her?

266
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,337
I cannot say for sure...

Without proper
examinations.

268
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,408
But they won't let us.

269
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,077
That is what makes me
so frustrated here.

270
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,280
You were up there.
How can you explain that?

271
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:57,617
There could be
many explanations.

272
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:01,921
The bed rocking,
a small earthquake, perhaps?

00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,456
A small earthquake?

274
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,125
Yeah, a small earthquake.

275
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:08,595
Come on, you expect
someone to believe that?

276
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:13,332
There are all kinds
of explanations.

277
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,569
But without being able to...

278
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:20,072
You know,
to have the psycho...

279
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:23,242

what happened up there.

280
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,845
As a scientist,
explain it.

00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,213

Jumping up and down
on the bed.

286

But that's not what
happened up there.

She wasn't
jumping up and down.

288
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,830
You saw what happened.
You were there.

289

She was writhing around
like she was...

290
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:48,468
Like having a seizure
or something.

291
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,969
Yeah, but how can you
explain what happened?

292
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,004
The bed wasn't having
a seizure. Nothing else...

293
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,441
How do you explain...
that was freaky shit.

294
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,742
How do you explain that?

295
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:59,345
Well, I can't
at this moment.

trippy shit last night, Dr. Landers.

00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,491
Why don't we start
with that, ok?

301
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,461
With Dr. Gruber?

302
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,663
From our perspective...

303
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,766
What we saw last night...

304
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,902
Was a young girl
writhing on a bed.

305
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,539
So we gave her a sedative,
and she was able to sleep.

306
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:30,643
And may I just say...

307
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,514
And I have no idea...

308
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:39,519
Were caused by...

309
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,787
And we need to help her.

310
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:46,425
She hasn't been sleeping.

311
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:48,160
And we want to help.

312
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,997
My dear doctor, yes,
your sedative helped.

313
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:54,734
It put her out.

314
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,336
The point is it stopped
the seizures as well.

315
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:01,273
Gruber: What has your exorcisms done
for her? Absolutely nothing.

316
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,709
Absolutely nothing?

317
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:08,047
The catholic Church
has for hundreds of years...

318
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,717
Been doing things
incorrectly.

319
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,085
They have believed...

320
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:17,356
That the world was flat
at one point, not round.

321
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:21,227
They did not think that
the Earth went around the sun.

322
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:26,232
And they still believe
in demons and ghosts.

323
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,502
Parker: You know, father, that I
was brought here by the doctors.

324
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,104
And they feel that
you're basically...

325
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:35,041
You're killing this girl.
What do you say to that?

326
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,576
Nonsense.

327
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,811
She's not doing very well.

328
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:41,581
Well, what are they doing?

329
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,150
Pumping her full
of sedatives?

330
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,753
This is going
to sustain her life?

331
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,623
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

332
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,828
That's what I see.

333
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,730
Gruber: I gave you
the courtesy to finish.

334
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,066
Extend that same
courtesy to me.

335
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,601
That is blasphemy.

336
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:03,803
There are many powers...

337
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,172
That neither you
not I understand.

338
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,608
It has gone into
a realm of faith.

339
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,743
All you can do...

340
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,613
Is explain this
through mumbo-jumbo...

341
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,514
Ghosts and devils.

342
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,483
The point is
the drugs did help...

343
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,889
And we can
help her more if we...

344
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,457
Speaks a foreign
language? Speaks...

345
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,727
Obviously she heard it
somewhere.

346
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,396
I can't explain that...

347
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,298
But I don't need
to explain that.

348
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,835
I spent my time teaching Greek
to somebody up there.

349
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,203
Are you
out of your mind?

350
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,739
She heard it on television
or on the radio.

351
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,974
Father,
medical research shows...

352
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,577
That people
who are having seizures...

353
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:46,278
Often speak
in other languages...

354
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:50,216
That they've only heard
a tiny fraction of their lives.

355
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,951
That's why we had them
cite religious text...

356
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,120
That they wouldn't
even understand.

357
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,955
I have no idea
what she was saying.

358
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,657
That's not the point.
The point...

359
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,659
Enough! Enough!

360
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:00,793

saying, doctor?

368
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,219
Yes, you know, I would
like to say this.

369
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,256
I want you to get this.
This is important.

370
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:36,062
Do you have any idea
where you are?

371
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,363
I think not.

372
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,233
I am the spiritual leader
in this community...

373
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,702
In this area.

374
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,671
This exorcism...

375
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,639
Was not only ordained...

376
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:49,075
But was ordered
by a diocese.

377
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,611
By the bishop.

378
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,383
So you want to go
to the authorities...

379
00:26:58,685 --> 00:27:01,721
Because they will laugh
you out of the courtroom.

380
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,191
This is
a different world...

381
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,859
You have stepped into.

382
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,995
Get this in your head.

383
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,732
It is beyond you
and the science.

384
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,100
In this area...

385
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:17,804
The politicians
come after the Church.

386
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,439
And now we are done.

387
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,042

Gruber: Anneliese!

390
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,026
I think it's complicated...

391
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:44,063
By the so-called
treatments...

392
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,033
The exorcisms
that have been going on.

393
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,068
I think we also have a case...

394
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:54,073
Of what I would term
doctrinaire induction.

395
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,811
I think that Anneliese
is being fed information...

396
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,579
On how to behave...

397
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,682
On how to have
these episodes...

398
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,117
By the very fact...

399
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,988
That the priests
have been telling her...

400
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,923
That she's possessed.

401
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,825
And what the devil does...

402
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,461
Is exactly what
she then manifests.

403
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,364
And I believe that
it's a complicated case...

404
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,932
But I don't think
it's too complicated...

405
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,868
For us to unravel.

I am Joseph Michel
and this is my wife Anna.

408
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,594
Ok, and what's happening
with your daughter?

409
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,996
What's going on?

410
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:26,933
Well, she is very sick.

411
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:30,136
She... six years ago...

412
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:34,006
She had...
what you say... a fit...

413
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:40,346
And then she began
to make many noises...

414
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:43,015
And to cry out.

My name is pastor Eich...

427
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:23,322
And I'm the priest
here in this community.

428
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,992

rusty, of course...

It's my first time...
are you of TV, I think?

432
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,802
I'm not sure.
Your camera is rolling.

433
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,971
Parker: So if that's
the case...

434
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,073
Why do you have
the priests here?

435
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,508
I mean, that sounds like...

436
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,676
Didn't you take her
to the doctor?

437
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:47,914
[Speaking German]

438
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,988
We took her
to the doctors, yes...

439
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:59,025
But they gave her
a strong medication.

440
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,460
But this did not help, so...

441
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,563
[Speaking German]

442
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,870
And quite all of a sudden...

443
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,007
She began to curse us...

444
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:18,144
And to, um... um...

445
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,112
To fight us, you know.

446
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:23,315
But that's... why is that
demonic possession?

447
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,885
Why isn't that just
a girl acting out?

448
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,021

the priests here?

She urinated on the ground...

455
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:52,278
And she began
to play with that...

456
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,880

to do with this, you know.

[Speaking German]

458
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:05,491
Despite the medication, she
began to call on the devil...

459

And call out.

461
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,831
There had to be
something else that was wrong...

to do something else.

00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,537

by the devil?

that the scientists are here?

469
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,256
Do you think that
they're going to harm her?

the intention's good.

I do understand
the intention's very good...

473

I just had a revelation

She is convinced
that the virgin Mary...

Is speaking to her
and telling her...

505
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,569
The exorcisms

coming from the person.

What we can discern
to this point...

589
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:34,425
Is that there are three
demonic entities involved.

the emperor Nero.

Remember that Thanksgiving
when you were at your grandmother's?

around here.

happened last night.

But I know
that a man is dead...

807

And we have to call
the authorities.

808
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,359
Now is the time that the authorities
have to be brought in.

809

by myself.

to me for a moment.

If the authorities are
brought in at this point...

814
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:46,576
Neither you nor I
will be able to help her.

815
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:49,212
They will take her
to a place...

816
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:51,080
That is beyond our reach...

817
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:55,652
And neither you nor I
will be able to help her.

818

I want to take her somewhere
where she can be helped.

819

to leave.

we're going to do.

that is losing.

826

of losing.

to understand something.

to perform this exorcism...

within the Church.

That was brought
in front of the courier...

834

And they brought it
in front of the cardinals.

835
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:39,396
There is a small group
of cardinals in Rome.

836

with these instances.

837

are not taken lightly.

somebody has died?

01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:48,511
The crosses...
still upside down.

904
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:53,816
No one can really explain
that, but...

905
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:54,984
Strange phenomena.

906
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:58,087
So I've been told.

907
01:20:58,154 --> 01:21:00,623
Same with the pictures.

908
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,230
And I'm going to go ahead
and go downstairs...

909
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:10,099
And catch some footage
of the...

910
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:15,038
Hey, there, girl.

911
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:18,774
You're foxy.

912
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:20,243
What are you doing here?

913
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:23,346
You're not
supposed to be here.

914
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:29,252
Oh, you gonna
put on a show?

915
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:32,755
You want it, don't you?
Crazy bitch.

916
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:35,524
Go ahead.
It's all right.

917
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:42,531
I thought...
ok. All right.

918
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,536
Oh, good god.

919
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:50,306
Fuck.

920
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:00,583
All right.

921
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:04,853
No. No. No.

922
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,289
Aah! No!

923
01:22:06,355 --> 01:22:09,458
Aah!

924
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:12,061
[Choking]

925
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:15,398
Aah!

926
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:53,336
I'm so sorry
I couldn't help you.

927
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:57,106
I'm so sorry
about everything.

928
01:23:04,347 --> 01:23:07,283
I want to get this
on tape.

929
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:12,221
I studied science
and medicine my whole life.

930
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:15,591
I thought I could
explain everything...

931
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,362
Including death.

932
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:22,098
And three people
have died here...

933
01:23:22,165 --> 01:23:26,335
And I don't know why.

934
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:29,038
And I should have
put a stop to it...

935
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:32,775
Weeks ago.

936
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,643
It's my fault.
I should have stopped it.

937
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:38,381
I should have
put an end to it.

938
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:40,683
But I'm going to. I'm going
to put an end to it...

939
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,285
Aah!

940
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,120
Aah!
