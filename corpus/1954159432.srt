00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,675
Wake up!

2
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,519
Wake up!

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,112
Wake up!

4
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,876
Wake up!

5
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,396
Wake up! Yee-ha!

6
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,191
- Oh, it is.
- Wake up!

7
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,429
Yeah!

8
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,635
Get back in the house. Hurry up.
Patty, Elizabeth! You get in here!

9
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,595
Now!

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,911
Wake up!

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,111
Wake up!

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,713
Wake up!

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,789
I told you it was
that damn new kid again.

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,634
Don't make me come up
after you there, boy!

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,396
Wake up!

16
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,078
Excuse me.
Either of you boys have any gum?

17
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,399
I got it.

18
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,993
Well, thanks a lot for the ride, fellas.

19
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,958
Thanks a lot.

20
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,111
Easy, easy, chief.

21
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,712
What's the matter?
Sheriff didn't feed you a banana?

22
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,950
All right, boys.
Nobody said to stop working.

23
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,315
That's right, boys, hard work works.

24
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,918
Mornin', Mr Benedict.

25
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,117
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-seven.

26
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,236
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-eight.

27
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,356
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-nine.

28
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,476
- One, two, three.
- Thirty.

29
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,438
All right. Sit-ups. Hit the deck.

30
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,551
And ready.

31
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,553
Up... down.

32
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,631
Up... down.

33
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,439
Up... down.

34
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,319
Up... down.

35
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,835
Up... down.

36
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,436
Up... down.

37
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,273
Up... Come on, Mr Blaine.
You can do better.

38
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,589
Keep it up.

39
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,196
Up... down.
Let's go, let's go! Up!

40
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,351
Come on. You think this is hard? Up...

41
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,274
...down. Life is hard. Up.
- I can't do it.

42
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,556
I will not tolerate you quitting on me.

43
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,631
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- All right.

44
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,913
You got yourself an extra half hour
of callisthenics after the boys go in.

45
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,989
Look at me. I got 30 years on you.

46
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,673
He ain't you, Benedict.

47
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,152
I know that's what you want,
but he ain't you.

48
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,311
You just got yourself another hour.

49
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,357
Make it two and you got a deal.

50
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,758
Welcome home.

51
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,314
Mr Benedict.

52
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,435
Billy, bring that ladder.

53
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,072
- Bradley.
- Huh?

54
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,753
Who is that?

55
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,793
Who?

56
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,553
Sara.

57
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,917
- What's she doing here?
- It's summer. Back from college.

58
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,548
That's not Sara.
That's too big to be Sara.

59
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,789
- She has...
- Tits.

60
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,393
Place looks great.

61
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,754
Doesn't it?

62
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,229
All right, Mr Tucker. That's enough.

63
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,349
Wait a minute.

64
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,235
Take these bags into the house, please.

65
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,397
Watch it! Hey!

66
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,716
- I have some fragile things in there.
- Mr Tucker, please be careful.

67
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,757
Get it into the barn right now!

68
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,151
- Who's that?
- He's the new boy. A handful.

69
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,839
Look at you, honey.
You light up this whole house.

70
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,357
I gotta get that.
Mr Tucker, take the bags upstairs.

71
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,789
Hello.

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,911
This is Eugene.

73
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,310
Yeah, well...

74
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,755
Look, would you please be careful?

75
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,189
Oops.

76
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,318
Mr Tucker, get these things picked up.

77
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,356
- What happened out there?
- Nothing.

78
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,433
If he gives you any trouble
just let me know.

79
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,078
I can take care of myself.

80
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,310
Of course you can.

81
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,993
Excuse me.

82
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,355
How about a whiskey, Junior?

83
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,272
Good song.

84
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,000
Hey, Molly,
come here and dance with us.

85
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,152
You wanna dance?

86
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,473
Sure.

87
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,712
- What are you doing, man?
- What?

88
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,552
I said, what are you doing?

89
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,710
No nigger music in here.

90
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,111
What's that in the juke for?

91
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,631
It ain't.

92
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,952
Let her go.

93
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,950
- You say something?
- Come on, be cool.

94
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,079
Cool?

95
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,598
- What kind of word is "cool"?
- Too many syllables?

96
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,149
Come on, Travis, leave him alone.

97
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,628
You're not from around here,
are you, boy?

98
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,234
You need a ride to the bus stop?

99
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,872
No thank you, sheriff.

100
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,190
Just here for a job, that's all.

101
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,670
- Music teacher, Benedict's place.
- Benedict expecting you?

102
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,558
Yes, sir, he is.

103
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,355
You enjoy making me look like a fool.

104
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,353
You do a pretty good job
of that yourself.

105
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,398
Let's go.

106
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,431
Y'all come back now.

107
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,517
I was hoping you'd come out.

108
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,831
I keep telling him we're old news

109
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,629
but he never was one
to keep up on current events.

110
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,679
Look, I run a club on the other side
of the tracks, so to speak.

111
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,115
- How's the booze?
- Terrible.

112
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,031
Step in sometime. Ask for Molly.

113
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,273
Hey, Molly.

114
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,795
How come that record was on the juke?

115
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,594
I slipped it in
when nobody was looking.

116
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,915
I'll see you around, Molly.

117
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,551
I'll definitely see you around.

118
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,112
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

119
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,158
You're more than qualified
for this job, Mr Cabe.

120
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,072
You're gonna find these kids
are damaged goods.

121
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,756
Some of them are orphaned,
others are sent here by their parents,

122
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,434
by the juvenile authorities,
a great pity.

123
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,155
A strong hand is what they need.

124
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,152
Discipline.

125
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,272
They need role models, Mr Cabe.

126
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,755
You don't have to worry about me.

127
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,277
You need somebody to get the boys
ready for the 4th of July concert.

128
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,759
I'm your guy.

129
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,753
I saw your sign when I
walked through the gate

130
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,148
and I agree with it.

131
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,756
I'll work hard with these boys
and I'll teach them their music.

132
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,232
Wake up.

133
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,554
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Do about what?

134
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,472
About what? About her.

135
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,552
Go over there and talk to her.
She wants to talk to you.

136
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,790
- No she doesn't.
- Yeah she does.

137
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,235
- No, really?
- No, really?

138
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,868
- You really think so?
- I know so.

139
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,951
You look fine. Go talk to her.

140
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,838
OK.

141
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,319
Go.

142
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,311
Wonder what he's thinking about.

143
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,513
I saw you looking gaga
at that girl in church.

144
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,795
No I wasn't.

145
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,473
Yeah, sure you weren't.

146
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,756
Oh, Alan! Oh, Alan!

147
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,559
Come fondle my massive milkers.

148
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,429
One, two, three and...

149
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,911
Quarter note, sharp attack.

150
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,914
Good.

151
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,669
Bradley, you've got to loosen up, man.

152
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,434
You're playing like a robot.
Try without this.

153
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,716
- I can't play without music.
- Try it.

154
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,398
I can't.

155
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,636
Jesse, you gonna joins us?

156
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,915
No.

157
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,354
- No?
- No.

158
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,358
Play chords with your left
and pick with the right.

159
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,795
- Pick with the right?
- Pick with the right.

160
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,636
Kinda like this, huh?

161
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,634
That's just the right look for you.
I know you better than you think.

162
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,634
If he don't want to participate,
I've got a job for him.

163
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,392
Mr Tucker.

164
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,473
Thanks.

165
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,076
Come on, let's go.
And one, two, three and...

166
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,195
- What is your problem?
- Excuse me?

167
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,148
You've taken some disliking to me.
Well, I don't much like you either.

168
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,518
So why don't you stay in your hole and
I'll stay as far away as possible, OK?

169
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,156
# Look at old Jesse there down in a hole

170
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,429
# He acts real tough
but he looks like a mole

171
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,713
What's your problem?

172
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,358
# His punishment was digging
in the mud and the sand

173
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,036
# When he could've been playing
with the boys in the band

174
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,999
Dick.

175
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,952
Come on, let's go.

176
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,032
- Get the lead out.
- Come on, come on.

177
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,951
Let's go.

178
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,952
Shut up.

179
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,352
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

180
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,674
Jeez Louise.
What's wrong with you guys today?

181
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,912
You were bad before
but you're stinking up the place now.

182
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,516
- What was that music you were playing?
- We'd like to play that.

183
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,477
Yeah, it gave me a boner.

184
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,393
- Will you teach us?
- No.

185
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,394
- Why not?
- Mr Benedict wouldn't appreciate it.

186
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,793
Keep going, Jesse.
Everybody join in.

187
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,552
Toby, quarter notes on that.

188
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,873
- Quarter notes on that.
- Straight quarter notes?

189
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,356
One and three on the bass drum.

190
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,319
Add a backbeat.

191
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,955
Good.

192
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,955
Bradley.

193
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,872
Just play the...

194
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,637
It's not on here.

195
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,279
You'll get used to it.

196
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,716
Big boy, just play the bass line.
Like this:

197
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,871
Da-da-da-da.

198
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,634
Good.

199
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,831
It's called rock and roll, boys.

200
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,949
Only a select few
know about this right now,

201
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,950
but I'll tell you something,
in the not-too-distant future

202
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,271
it is gonna burn through this country
like a prairie fire.

203
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,911
You think you can handle it?

204
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,829
- You got the guts?
- Dang straight, man.

205
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,998
Well, you can't.

206
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,392
Not yet. You gotta get better. OK?

207
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,472
Now this is the deal.
You practice real hard

208
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,235
and you learn your music
for the show, and then...

209
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,517
...then we'll talk about rock and roll.

210
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,194
You guys gotta practice.

211
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,794
I hope you taste better than you look.

212
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,470
Come here, you stinkin' bird.
Get over here!

213
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,392
Let's go. Let's go up there.

214
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,993
Move out of the way, boys.
Coming through.

215
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,590
- Let's get it and go.
- Come on, hurry up.

216
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,678
Excuse me.

217
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,199
Hey, you guys,
know what would be great?

218
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,029
What?

219
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,475
- Start our own rock and roll band.
- Easy.

220
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,358
- Could we do that?
- We could.

221
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,159
Jesse, wanna join
our rock and roll band?

222
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,392
No.

223
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,508
- Beautiful.
- Most beautiful girl I ever saw.

224
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,478
- Only girl you ever saw.
- I'll kick your butt.

225
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,234
- Try it, blimpo.
- I'm gonna nail her.

226
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,913
What?

227
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,834
I'll light up Benedict's precious
daughter like a pinball machine.

228
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,755
What do you mean?

229
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,673
What do you mean what do I mean?
What do you think?

230
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,955
Yeah, sure you are.

231
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,554
You wanna bet? Huh?

232
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,233
Come on, you boys must have
a little chore allowance saved up.

233
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,834
Put your money where your big mouth is.

234
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,877
OK.

235
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,272
- I'll bet.
- Me too.

236
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,749
- How much, two dollars?
- Wait.

237
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,356
- We shouldn't bet about this.
- What's the matter? Chicken?

238
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,988
No, I'm not chicken,
I just don't think...

239
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,118
You shut up.

240
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,999
- You what?
- It's not right.

241
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,628
- She's a nice girl.
- So marry her.

242
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,075
Are you kidding me?

243
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,156
Look at her sitting back there.
That's Benedict's little pride and joy.

244
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,311
This'll teach him.

245
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,434
Fine, you don't want in? No problem.

246
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,398
- How about the rest of you guys?
- I'm in.

247
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,036
Psst.
Hey, Jesse. Jesse.

248
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,313
Hey, Sara.

249
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,392
How you doing?

250
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,598
Did you have a good ride?

251
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,550
- Nice legs. On you too, Sara.
- I've had enough.

252
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,793
Oops.

253
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,517
- Shut up.
- Regular Cary Grant.

254
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,272
Smooth move, ex-lax.

255
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,073
Hi.

256
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,750
You're not supposed to be in here.

257
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,073
No, it's OK,
I get invited in here quite a bit.

258
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,832
My father will be back.

259
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,958
- Do you want me to go?
- Do what you want?

260
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,237
- OK, I'll go.
- No, don't.

261
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,439
Listen, Sara, I'm really sorry
that I threw dirt on your feet.

262
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,878
You're the first pretty girl
we've had around and...

263
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,031
...I guess I got a little flustered.

264
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,875
- What are you doing?
- Just writing a letter for my father.

265
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,831
Is this a picture of you?

266
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,279
- Yes.
- Really?

267
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,919
Yeah.

268
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,235
I got a little picture too, actually.

269
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,148
- Are these your parents?
- Yeah.

270
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,754
Handsome couple. Where are they now?

271
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,638
They died.

272
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,473
- Oh.
- Yeah, in a car crash.

273
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,918
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK, it was a long time ago.

274
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,074
My mom died when I was eight.

275
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,878
I remember that she had this one freckle
on the end of her nose.

276
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,474
She would call it her kiss button.

277
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,435
Whenever I would touch it
she would give me a kiss.

278
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,156
Hey, what's the matter?

279
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,118
Nothing. Just hadn't
thought about it for a while.

280
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,594
Look, I should go.

281
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,989
Why?

282
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,676
I'll see you later.

283
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,829
- Try it without the sheet music.
- I can't play without the music.

284
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,189
I wanna see you after class.

285
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,636
OK, guys, and one, two, three...

286
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,758
- You scared?
- Yeah.

287
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,753
Yeah, me too. Stay there.
Stay there. Stay there.

288
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,348
All right. Go from there to here
without walking. No running either.

289
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,318
- How am I supposed to do that?
- I don't know.

290
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,869
Just use your imagination, man.

291
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,716
Come on. Come on.

292
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,156
Yeah, that's it.

293
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,629
- Now something else.
- What else?

294
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,075
I don't know, something else.

295
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,231
- Like what?
- Anything.

296
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,597
Walk like a monkey,
cluck like a chicken. I don't care.

297
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,035
- Monkeys don't cluck.
- Come on, just do it.

298
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,554
Come on.

299
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,317
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,474
Good, man.

301
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,393
- How long should I do this?
- Till you get it right.

302
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,279
Now come on. Come on, man.

303
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,512
Yes, yes, yes.

304
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,276
- What's up?
- Pork chops for dinner.

305
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,758
What a dick.

306
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,474
Hi.

307
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,193
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,072
I got something for you.

309
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,555
- It looked a little worse for the wear.
- Thanks.

310
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,356
It's an old frame of my mother's.

311
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,079
- You didn't have to...
- I...

312
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,792
OK.

313
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,428
Well, I'll talk to you later.

314
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,078
- Don't sleep much, do you?
- Uh-huh.

315
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,276
What are you running from?

316
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,435
What makes you think I'm running?

317
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,111
You're a runner all right.

318
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,437
- Morning.
- Morning.

319
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,354
- What are you doing up so early?
- Couldn't sleep.

320
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,229
This is what I was looking forward to
most about coming back here.

321
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,949
- Do you ride?
- No, we aren't allowed to ride them.

322
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,159
Pretty good at cleaning up
their crap, though.

323
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,478
Did you like the picture?

324
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,633
Yeah.

325
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,320
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

326
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,155
I never did get to thank you.

327
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,833
For the picture.

328
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,876
I love this time of morning.

329
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,597
Would you like to kiss me?

330
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,113
Now walk like a monkey
and cluck like a chicken.

331
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,035
You know, I've been thinking.
I've never done it before.

332
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,471
Maybe you could teach me.

333
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,271
- Teach you?
- Yeah.

334
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,034
'Cause it's going to be
a long, hot summer.

335
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,269
Mm-hmm.

336
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,950
Do you ever let other people touch it?

337
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,277
- You mean my guitar.
- Of course.

338
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,033
What else would I be talking about?

339
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,792
That's it. Just go. Let it go, man.

340
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,555
All right, now play it. One...

341
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,712
They are doing so much better.
They're starting to sound like a band.

342
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,314
It's your methods, Mr Cabe...

343
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,833
...in the classroom.

344
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,516
And those silly, stupid dances you're
teaching Kroft and Blaine in the field.

345
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,753
- I'm trying to make it fun for them.
- You didn't see them when they came.

346
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,195
Delinquents running around with gangs.

347
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,510
Control got them this far.

348
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,355
I am so sure everything you've done
for these kids is great.

349
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,748
Thank you.

350
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,832
I just feel there are other ways
of getting results.

351
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,437
Mr Cabe, I'm not gonna argue with you.
I can always get another music teacher.

352
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,355
- What do you want?
- Wanna hear some tunes.

353
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,715
No. No more records.

354
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,917
- Why not?
- You heard them all.

355
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,719
- We'll listen to them again.
- I can't.

356
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,553
- Why can't we?
- I just can't, OK?

357
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,951
It's Benedict, isn't it?
He found out.

358
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,474
It's OK. He gets to everybody
sooner or later.

359
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,151
Wait a minute.

360
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,190
- All right!
- Yes!

361
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,955
- OK, any of you guys got a radio?
- No. Why?

362
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,557
- Forget it.
- What?

363
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,713
What? I'm not gonna get you
cranked up over nothing. Forget it.

364
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,791
Come on, tell us.

365
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,679
All right.

366
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,190
There's this DJ I know about.

367
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,432
- What's a DJ?
- Don't you know nothing, man?

368
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,916
Tell him, Mr Cabe.

369
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,916
A DJ's a disc jockey,
a man who spins platters on the radio.

370
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,595
There's this one fella in particular,
out of Memphis I believe,

371
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,799
and he plays the hottest rock and roll,
I mean real scorchers.

372
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,315
Strictly underground stuff.

373
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,677
Now, he calls himself
the Midnight Rider.

374
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,119
Everybody has tried to shut him down.
Parents, school teachers, government.

375
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,434
President Eisenhower tried to
shut him down, but nobody could.

376
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,160
He's always one step ahead of the law.

377
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,278
Nobody can stop the Midnight Rider.

378
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,317
How can we hear him?

379
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,948
Well, like I said, you need a radio.

380
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,993
You probably even need a short wave
all the way out here to pick him up.

381
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,912
Now beat it.

382
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,077
I can fix the radio in the garage.

383
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,310
There's a book in class about radios.

384
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,710
- All we need is the pieces.
- Let's do it.

385
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,358
- Sure you don't want me to do this?
- No, I gotta do it.

386
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,078
Keep your eyes peeled.

387
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,075
Bradley! Bradley, come on!

388
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,314
What are you doing?

389
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,633
- What's that?
- This...

390
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,951
...is a project for science class.

391
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,796
We're getting extra credit for
taking apart radios and examining them.

392
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,918
You can do better than that.

393
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,112
We wanna listen to a radio show
that Mr Cabe told us about

394
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,033
and I need one of these to build
a short wave radio.

395
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,637
- What show?
- Midnight Rider.

396
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,268
Come on, he's coming!
Come on.

397
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,277
Go on, take it. Take it.

398
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,995
We listen to Midnight Rider in college.

399
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,479
Yeah?

400
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,912
Thank you, Sara.

401
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,156
You sort of cradle the neck
with your left hand.

402
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,197
And you rest this on your knee.

403
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,193
All right, let's say like a D chord.

404
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,830
- What?
- Nothing.

405
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,315
You put your first finger
in the second fret.

406
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,199
- Put this one here, that one there.
- Mm-hmm.

407
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,031
Now with your right...
You've got to hold on tighter here.

408
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,315
- OK.
- OK?

409
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,993
- OK.
- OK.

410
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,511
All right, now strum.

411
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,475
- That's good.
- That's bad.

412
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,518
- That was good. It was good.
- You know it sounds bad.

413
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,878
I've got it. In the bridge coming off
the verse, you play like before, right?

414
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,112
And then I'll answer you.

415
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,840
And we'll do it four times, right?

416
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,714
- It'll be perfect.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

417
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,033
Why don't you just
keep doing it? D chord.

418
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,672
I've got a problem.

419
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,592
- I guess Jesse's gonna win that bet.
- Shut up.

420
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,478
- Hi, Sara.
- Hi, Bradley.

421
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,913
- Did you get that radio working?
- Yeah. Thank you for that.

422
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,318
You OK?

423
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,471
Yeah, I'm fine.

424
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,872
What's wrong?

425
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,110
There's something I have to tell you.

426
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,999
A bet? A stupid bet?

427
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,435
Well, come on,
let's win that bet for you.

428
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,431
Come on, here I am.

429
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,551
- That's what I thought.
- Sara...

430
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,110
It started out as a bet,
but it's not about that anymore.

431
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,192
That's almost as good
as that lie about your parents,

432
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,828
or whoever those people
in the picture were.

433
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,719
You were using me
to get at my father, weren't you?

434
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,155
That what this was all about?

435
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,993
Well, I'm not my father, Jesse.

436
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,991
Now, let's start off with...

437
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,558
- Find the Midnight Rider.
- I'm trying to.

438
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,710
Are you out there,
brothers of the night?

439
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,757
- That's it.
- Are you listening?

440
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,832
Flying to you
on night-silent black wings.

441
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,518
Getting inside you, urging you,
telling you that tonight anything,

442
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,478
anything can happen.

443
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,959
Are your ears open?

444
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,156
Because the ears and not the eyes
are the windows of the soul.

445
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,992
Listen, my children.

446
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,959
Listen.

447
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,156
Listen.

448
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,231
Listen.

449
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,234
Jesse.

450
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,712
- Where are you going?
- Him.

451
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,156
- Why?
- I want my money.

452
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,033
Jesse.

453
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,272
I thought you were gonna nail Sara.
Did you chicken out?

454
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,749
- Yeah, you chicken out?
- We had a bet.

455
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,035
- Pay up.
- That's right. Put up or shut up.

456
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,799
Jesse, wait a second. Jesse.

457
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,679
Jesse.

458
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,594
Jesse.

459
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,309
What happened?

460
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,277
- Where are you going?
- Out.

461
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,830
Bradley. Hey.
What if Benedict catches us?

462
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,792
Let's go.

463
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,760
- This is it. Come on.
- Sure we can get in?

464
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,994
How do they know about...?

465
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,638
Hello.

466
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,675
- You know what you're gonna say?
- Shut up. Let me talk.

467
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,230
- How do we get in?
- I don't like this.

468
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,398
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

469
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,913
Hi.

470
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,070
We're friends of Cabe's.

471
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,039
Come on.

472
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,839
Hi.

473
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,551
Shut up!

474
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,196
What did you call me?

475
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,748
Take your time.

476
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,793
Hey.

477
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,234
Hey.

478
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,909
It was me.

479
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,989
- What?
- I told Sara about the bet.

480
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,513
What did you do that for?

481
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,911
'Cause you're an asshole.

482
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,197
You don't make a bet on a girl
about something like that.

483
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,231
You like her, don't you?

484
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,553
- Huh?
- Yeah.

485
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,277
But she's in love with you.

486
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,239
You're blowing it, man.

487
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,918
What are you doing, boy?

488
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,753
Take it easy on that stuff,
it'll make you blind.

489
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,992
- How you doing?
- You brought the troops with you.

490
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,391
Better not make a habit of this,
we'll both get in trouble.

491
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,470
How you doing?

492
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,639
- I don't know, man.
- You got it pretty bad, don't you?

493
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,951
She ain't nothing
like what I thought she was.

494
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,392
They never are.

495
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,272
Why don't you get up there tonight
and jam with the rest of them?

496
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,910
- Why don't you?
- Maybe I will.

497
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,071
Come on, sugar, let's dance.

498
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,956
As long as you're here
have a good time.

499
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,998
I'm gonna do this.

500
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,273
- You did good tonight, Jesse.
- I did, didn't I?

501
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,715
Yeah, you were good. You were hot.

502
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,593
Well, well, well.
What have we got here?

503
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,991
- A little after hours action, huh?
- Travis, you're drunk.

504
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,388
Just you and me.

505
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,949
What's the matter with you?
It's you and me.

506
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,918
Completely off the record. No badge...

507
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,640
- Sleep it off, man.
... no gun.

508
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,438
Hey! Hey!

509
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,113
Cabe, man,
come on, that's enough.

510
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,750
- Stop.
- Let go. Let go.

511
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,309
- Jesse, get him out of here.
- Let me at him!

512
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,075
Just get him out! Are you crazy?
He's a goddamn sheriff!

513
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,269
I don't know. I've never felt like that,
never played like that. It was amazing.

514
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,069
I know, but I don't think running away
is a good idea.

515
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,110
Well, I'm not going back in there.

516
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,108
- Can't beat these sons of bitches.
- You can.

517
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,352
- It's a rigged game.
- It's a rigged game if you run away.

518
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,397
They automatically win that way.

519
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,436
I wouldn't do it.

520
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,670
I wouldn't do it if I were you.

521
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,636
If you're gonna go I'd go now.

522
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,759
He'll be up anytime.
I'll cover for you as long as I can.

523
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,115
- You got bucks?
- Yeah, I got some.

524
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,671
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Same.

525
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,671
All right, you know where to get me
if you need me.

526
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,991
You know, I want to give you something.

527
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,751
I wanna give you this.

528
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,231
- No, man, I can't take that.
- Yeah.

529
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,359
A good friend of mine gave me this...

530
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,273
...and I want to give it to you.

531
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,159
So please, take it. Go ahead.

532
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,831
Thanks.

533
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,152
I'd learn how to fix it 'cause it costs
an arm and a leg to get it repaired.

534
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,471
Glad to have you back.

535
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,272
You young people are coming to a time

536
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,000
when difficult decisions must be made,

537
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,111
as is our country.

538
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,158
There is a moral decay
eating away at our land.

539
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,400
In books, on television,

540
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,518
in the movies...

541
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,830
- Pass...
... in our own government.

542
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,748
And now in this new music.

543
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,439
It is a foul, black music,

544
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,597
godless and profane.

545
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,119
I implore you to say no to it.

546
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,831
Shout no to it.

547
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,430
And now let's bow our heads
in a moment of silent prayer

548
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,152
and ask God for the strength
and courage to fight this evil

549
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,154
that threatens the very foundation
of our American way of life.

550
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,273
Sara.

551
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,837
Sara, I'm sorry about last night.

552
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,391
About the bet and everything.
I got no excuses.

553
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,757
Except that you scare me. I mean...

554
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,992
That first day you showed up
I remember thinking,

555
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,392
"This is the kinda girl that would never
want to have anything to do with me. "

556
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,120
So I guess
I must've known already that...

557
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,272
...I liked you... and it scared me.

558
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,634
You were right about the picture.

559
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,153
It came with the wallet.

560
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:51,233
They just looked like the kind
of folks a guy should have and...

561
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,152
...I just sort of adopted them.

562
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,675
So who were your parents?

563
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,475
Who were my parents?

564
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,474
My father was a wildcat
and my mother was a waitress.

565
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,030
Or maybe she was a salesgirl
and he was in the service.

566
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,833
Or maybe they were just two
teenagers who met behind a bar.

567
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,193
You heard about the trouble
we had at the Lizard Lounge.

568
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,590
I have. I'm sorry, Travis.

569
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,149
You were right.
I should've fired the guy.

570
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,869
- I'll do it as soon as I get back.
- I don't want you to do that.

571
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,759
I've been checking around
like we talked about.

572
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,799
I'm expecting a phone call from
the sheriff in Biloxi, Mississippi.

573
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,431
They had trouble there a couple years
back and the description could be Cabe.

574
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,238
I ain't sure that it's him.

575
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,036
But if it is I don't want you
to spook him, so sit tight.

576
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,237
I want this man
just as bad as you, Eugene.

577
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,191
Just as bad as you.

578
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,232
We're cookin' now, daddy.

579
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,990
Who is responsible for this?

580
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,834
I am.

581
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,871
No he's not, I am.

582
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,358
It's me.

583
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,758
You know who it is.

584
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,352
All right, everybody
back to the dormitory.

585
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,398
You, come with me.

586
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,273
I've been easy on you long enough now.

587
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,476
This is your new bed.

588
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,118
Get used to it.

589
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,319
Jesse.

590
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,112
- You OK in there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

591
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,558
I thought you guys were heading
to the girls school.

592
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,668
We decided not to.

593
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,793
Why?

594
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,318
You know...

595
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,635
Look, you like her, don't you?

596
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,630
- I can't stop thinking about her.
- Then go down and see her.

597
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,833
OK. Thanks, Jesse.

598
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,675
Wait up. Come on, man, wait up.

599
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,196
- Come on, slowpoke.
- Guys, keep it down.

600
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,914
What are you doing?

601
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,798
Be careful.

602
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,316
- What's he doing?
- Lame-brain, what's it look like?

603
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,752
They're coming.

604
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,040
- There she is.
- Listen, maybe we should go.

605
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,712
- Come on.
- Yeah, we should go.

606
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,996
- Shut up, wuss.
- Come on.

607
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,719
Come on, let's go...

608
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,678
- Turn the radio on.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

609
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,353
Are you leaving?

610
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,436
Come on, come on, come on. All right.

611
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,353
This is the Midnight Rider
on KCWR,

612
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,832
riding on the silver waves
of this moonlit night.

613
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,752
Are you out there?

614
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,638
Are you listening?

615
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,678
Do you wanna dance?

616
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,351
OK.

617
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,796
What are you boys doing here?

618
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,349
- What's your name?
- Rebecca.

619
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,918
My name's Alan...

620
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,073
...and I love you.

621
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,911
- I can't stay.
- Why not?

622
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,196
My father, he'll know I'm gone.

623
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,518
- He's gotta know someday.
- I know.

624
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,438
Don't you want to get away?

625
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,194
Don't you everjust want to go
and keep on going?

626
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,910
- Sure.
- I know I do.

627
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,269
I don't want to see nothing but blacktop
for a couple thousand miles.

628
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,991
Where would you go?

629
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,036
There's this place. They've got this
little bar and a stage in the corner.

630
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,239
On Friday nights everybody comes down
and gets to drink and makes noise

631
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,960
so you can barely hear the music.

632
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,871
But I wouldn't care, I'd just play.

633
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,431
And keep playing till there
wasn't anything left to play

634
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,989
and then I'd play
until they dragged me out.

635
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,914
Where is it?

636
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,073
I don't know.

637
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,993
You'll find it.

638
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,599
Go!

639
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,598
Hey, what gives?

640
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,434
He's gone.

641
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,918
What's going on?

642
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,277
- What are you doing out here?
- I wanna know what happened?

643
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,075
Your Mr Cabe is a wanted man.

644
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,479
He's a murderer.

645
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,434
What's the matter with you guys?

646
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,599
- Don't let Benedict see you like this.
- How are we supposed to act?

647
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,594
- You believe what they're saying?
- I suppose the cops made it up, huh?

648
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,150
- I don't care what the cops say.
- Then where is he, Jesse?

649
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,117
- Where did he go?
- He'll be back.

650
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,589
He'd be back if he was coming back.

651
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,591
You guys can go to hell.

652
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,474
Jesse? Where are you going?

653
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,598
Go, Jesse!

654
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,395
Yahoo!

655
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,597
There's this friend of mine,
a coloured guy.

656
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,672
We were playing gigs in Biloxi,
Mississippi.

657
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,512
All coloured clubs.

658
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:05,310
And then this one night this guy
who owned a white club came in.

659
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,074
He heard us.
He thought we were pretty good,

660
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,152
and he offered us a gig at his club.

661
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,950
He said that he didn't really care
what colour the musicians were

662
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,476
as long as they were good,
and we were good.

663
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,471
Josh tried to talk me out of it.

664
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,153
He said he didn't think it was worth
making the trouble over.

665
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,074
There was something about the idea
that they didn't want us there

666
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,153
that made me want to play that gig
more than anything else in the world.

667
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,392
So we played.
At least we started to play.

668
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,473
Got eight bars through the first song
and then all the troubles started.

669
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,916
Someone threw a beer bottle
at Josh's face.

670
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,876
And someone had a knife.

671
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,952
I tried to stop it with my hand.

672
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,509
But it went through my hand
and into his gut.

673
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,036
I swear my hand was stuck to his belly.

674
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,272
And I looked up and...

675
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,069
...there was this...
this kind of puzzled look on his face.

676
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,630
And I picked up this broken beer bottle

677
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,473
and I went after the son
of a bitch who got Josh.

678
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,032
So I got away.

679
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,351
And I ran, and I ran...

680
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,995
...and I'm still running.

681
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,512
Maybe it's time to stop.

682
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:33,478
Don't throw my words back at me.
This is different.

683
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,790
- How is this different?
- Get serious.

684
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,872
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- I killed a white man

685
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,792
in order to help a coloured man,

686
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,554
and in Mississippi
that is as wrong as you get.

687
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,278
Fight them.

688
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,712
I'll help you.

689
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,553
Come on, get out. Get out.

690
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,314
Get the hell out of here, man!

691
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:23,757
- One, two, three.
- Twenty-four.

Mr Benedict...

699
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,991

700
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,276
What was that, Mr Tucker?

704
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,072
Hi.

705
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,599
Hey.

706
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,394
You OK?

707
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,433
I'm fine.

708
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,153
- I waited for you after band practice.
- I had to work in the yard.

709
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,470
I left a note with Alan.

710
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,471
Yeah, I know, I got it.

711
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,517
What's the matter with you?

712
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,592
People been asking me that
my whole life.

713
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,232
I wanna see you.

714
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,199
I don't think that's such a good idea.

715
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:03,839
Why not?

716
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,760
- Jesse?
- 'Cause your father, that's why.

717
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,230
Since when do you care
what he thinks about anything?

718
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:19,032
- I'm gonna be leaving soon.
- Yeah, I know, and I'm not.

719
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,751
You'll go off to college and I'm gonna
stay and dig ditches for your old man.

720
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,354
I just wanna put in my time
and get out of here.

721
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,635
And go where?

722
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,869
There's a great spot with a stage...

723
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,838
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

724
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,275
Every time I hit,
they hit me back harder.

725
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,352
- When I start to trust somebody...
- You can trust me.

726
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,431
And you're leaving, aren't you?

727
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,997
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention.

728
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,594
Always a great pleasure
this time of year

729
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:08,356

for Boys Band!

730
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,073
I'll be back.

731
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,799
All right.

732
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,437
Cuff him.

733
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,436
- I'll see ya.
- Let's go.

734
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,311
One, two, three, four. Whoo!

735
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,433
Alright!

736
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,750
What the hell's going on?

737
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,111
Come on, get up!

738
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,593
- You hear that kid?
- Yeah, I hear him.

739
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,070
All right, that's it, kids.

740
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,953
- Where are you going?
- Let me go.

741
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,509
Yeah!
