1
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,383
Fuck!

2
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,286
Okay.

3
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,647
What the fuck?

4
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,731
What the... what the fuck?

5
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,870
What the fuck?

6
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,273
What the fuck?!

7
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,092
In the next hour,

8
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:22,496
two candidates are in a tight race
heading into the Iowa Caucus.

9
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:40,414
An update on the Colorado
missing persons case

10
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,715
we've been covering all week.

11
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,617
Five people were found dead today

12
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,420
in a warehouse outside Wheat Ridge,
a Denver suburb.

13
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,989
In a public statement,
investigators stated

14
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,726
they were all killed
in "a ritualistic manner".

15
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,929
And finally, controversial celebrity
news magazine Pop Now

16
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,963
has filed for bankrupt.

17
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,777
In other news,

18
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,412
the weather this weekend looks terrible.

19
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,535
What'd you get me?

20
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,405
What did I get you? /
Yeah, what'd you get me?

21
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:40,474
You'll see. / Is it lacy and frilly?

22
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,577
I'm intrigued.

23
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,688
Do you know how you always
leave your stuff in my bathroom?

24
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,525
Yeah, you hate it.

25
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,527
Do you know why I hate it?

26
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,030
Because it's girls' stuff
and it's not a girl's bathroom.

27
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,833
But it could be.

28
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,044
We should talk about it.

29
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,683
We should talk about it...

30
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,521
After this long, completely
avoiding the subject.

31
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,589
Sure.

32
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,428
Seriously?

33
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,533
Seriously.

34
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,970
Deal?

35
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,972
Deal. / Hey?

36
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:45,973
Yeah? / Shake.

37
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,675
All right. / Deal.

38
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,028
Pleasure doing business with you.

39
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,078
Nice doing business with you.

40
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,498
Thank you.

41
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,808
Big brother! / Hi.

42
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,543
Hi! You look great.

43
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,845
He really cleans up, doesn't he? / Yeah!

44
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:27,648
Finally! / Birthday boy! Hey!

45
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,083
Happy birthday! Oh.

46
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,020
Yeah! Hey, there he is.
/ Sorry, everyone.

47
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,555
My fault.

48
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,124
My keen instinct told me
you would all be here,

49
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,559
so naturally I had to change

50
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,694
to dress down to your level.

51
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,263
Ha ha. / So selfless,
even on your birthday.

52
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,932
You're welcome. / Yeah.

53
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,567
Well, we've been
celebrating without you.

54
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,570
Mm. / Mm. Hey, bud, one more bottle.

55
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:53,541
My wife ordered
for you already. Halibut.

56
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,075
Prime filet. Rare.

57
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,544
Hmm.

58
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,245
Crab. / Yes.

59
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,548
Burger with side of Brussels. / Mm-hmm.

60
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,583
Chicken piccata.

61
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,653
Salmon, no mushrooms.

62
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,554
And Hadlee.

63
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:08,988
Says she's filled up on bread,

64
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,924
but ends up picking
at everyone else's food.

65
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,128
I thought we'd all like to share.

66
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,564
Are we really that predictable?

67
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,298
Not predictable...

68
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,800
Committed. / Mm.

69
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,268
Insane people are committed,

70
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,804
or sell art at my gallery.

71
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:24,972
We are steadfast.

72
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,040
Or stubborn.

73
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,078
How does it feel to be old?

74
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,647
I asked him the same thing.

75
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,315
How old am I again? / You're old.

76
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,250
So old.

77
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,720
Old enough to know what you want.

78
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,255
What do you want for your birthday?

79
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,595
A toast. / Yes, a toast.

80
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,262
To my... / No, not your toast.

81
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,666
It's not your toast.

82
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
It's okay. / I'm still drinking.

83
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,771
I thought it was just a silly cliché,

84
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,106
but you are living proof

85
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,041
that things really
do get better with age.

86
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,611
Okay, okay.

87
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,113
Okay. Babe?

88
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,816
I'm so thankful to celebrate
your birthday with you,

89
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:12,185
and I'm looking forward
to many, many more.

90
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,621
Hey, sweet.

91
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:15,022
Cheers. / Cheers.

92
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,123
Cheers.

93
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,594
Mm.

94
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,932
Oh! / What's this?

95
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,767
I thought no presents
'til tomorrow's brunch.

96
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,768
Yeah.

97
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,037
I guess we're not all
predictable after all.

98
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,139
You guys got him presents?

99
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,874
Yeah, it's his birthday.

100
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,785
What?

101
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,325
Escape room? / Yep.

102
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,061
Yeah. / What is that?

103
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,028
You're locked in a room

104
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,264
until you solve a series
of puzzles to get out.

105
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,699
And you've only got one hour.

106
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,400
No, that sounds horrible.

107
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,869
That sounds really fun.

108
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,937
I've heard it's the latest craze.

109
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,307
Remember that, um, secret mask thing,

110
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,374
the Macbeth thing in New York last year?

111
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,744
That wasn't an escape room. / I know.

112
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,380
I'm just saying it's the latest
underground thing.

113
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,613
They're popping up everywhere.

114
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,351
I think Shakespeare in any
form is so fucking boring.

115
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,721
Yeah. / I agree with you.

116
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,923
This won't be.
I promise.

117
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,259
What happens if we
don't figure it out in time?

118
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,627
We're trapped.

119
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,731
Forever.

120
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:39,006
It's a challenge.
A test of intelligence.

121
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,175
Hmm.

122
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,982
All right, I'm in.
Where is this room?

123
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,718
The mystery is part of the game.

124
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,154
Ooo, exciting!
So how do we get there?

125
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,222
I've arranged everything.

126
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:58,191
I just need you to play along.

127
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,861
How did you / Oh!

128
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,328
come up with something so adventurous?

129
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,298
Excuse me!
What, are you surprised?

130
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,868
Very surprised.

131
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,071
Good. Happy birthday.

132
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,980
Let's get drunk.

133
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,452
Really, it's not necessary.
/ No, I'm just kidding.

134
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,389
This is us.

135
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,824
Oh! / Oooh!

136
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,260
This is how to party. / Yes.

137
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,561
Damn. / I want to come.

138
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:38,398
Babe, we were so specific
about reservations.

139
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,433
If we could ever get ahold of you...

140
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,835
Ugh, I'm so unlucky.

141
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,971
No, honey, you're just a wild card.

142
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,741
Goodbye. / Come on, beautiful.

143
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,911
It won't be the same without you, kid.

144
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,880
At least I already have plans.

145
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,182
Do you want me to call you a cab?

146
00:11:56,183 --> 00:12:00,854
I'll get a ride.
You guys have fun.

147
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,858
How you gonna get home?
/ Oh, I'm not going home.

148
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,460
This girl's got a sexy party to go to.

149
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,798
Sexy party.

150
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,800
Ay, ay!

151
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,902
Trouble. / Yeah.

152
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,906
Oh, my God, that's good.

153
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:21,341
Look at the...
Oh, look who decided to come in!

154
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,011
Hey, buddy, there you are!

155
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,879
What's up? / Happy birthday, man!

156
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,881
Happy birthday!

157
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,894
I love this stuff. / I know.

158
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,363
This is amazing.
Thank you.

159
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,098
Oh, don't thank me yet.

160
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,907
Oh, come on. / Okay, guys.

161
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,945
Gonna need your cell phones, please.

162
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,447
Um...

163
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,482
Hell no.

164
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,583
Yes.

165
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,219
Can't have you looking up
how to solve a puzzle.

166
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,454
No help from anyone.

167
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,889
Uh...

168
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,826
There's no lifelines in this game?

169
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,828
Come on! / No.

170
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,296
For an hour?

171
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,032
Come on, what's the big deal?

172
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,033
As birthday ambassador,

173
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,836
I order all of you
to relinquish your phones.

174
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,504
Thank you.

175
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,210
Hey, you know what?
Fuck it.

176
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,880
Hand 'em over. / Here you go.

177
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,915
Thank you. / Here.

178
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,628
As you wish, birthday ambassador.

179
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,519
All righty. One more.

180
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,325
What? / It's everyone or no one.

181
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,862
Fine.

182
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,301
Proud of you, Anderson.

183
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,403
Fuck off.

184
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,038
Ouch. / Why is he so mean to me?

185
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,238
I love him and he's so mean to me.

186
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,975
All right, guys, I'm also
going to need your wallets,

187
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,311
your purses, anything else
in your pockets.

188
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,412
Fuck.

189
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,948
All you can take with you are your wits.

190
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,017
And there's insurance
on this game and all, right?

191
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,120
I take full responsibility
for everything. / Okay.

192
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,633
Thank you, Conrad. / You're welcome.

193
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,557
All righty. Got it? / Nice.

194
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,965
Happy birthday.

195
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:28,535
Yeah!

196
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,502
Whoo!

197
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,592
Does anybody know how long
we've been driving for?

198
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,663
How could we,
when we can't see anything?

199
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,165
Let's just ask the driver.

200
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,943
Maybe it's not supposed to open.

201
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,344
It's all part of it.

202
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,113
Christen, how'd you find this place?

203
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,382
They're everywhere.
Hiding in plain sight.

204
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,217
What, is there an escape room app?

205
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,052
You just tap and sign up? What?

206
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,721
The Uber of entrapment games?

207
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,391
No, no app. No nothing on the Internet.

208
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,927
Well, then how'd you find it?

209
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:29,997
I got this.

210
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,072
What is that?

211
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,008
An invitation.

212
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,623
It's cute.

213
00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah, but the question is, who sent it?

214
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,429
I don't know.

215
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,266
But I know with all the research
I've been doing on escape rooms,

216
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,001
my name got on some list,

217
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,403
and this ended up in my mailbox.

218
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,438
It's Morse code.

219
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:17,144
It spells G-A-M-E.

220
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,378
Game.

221
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,048
Oh!

222
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,220
What? / Oh.

223
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,221
Huh.

224
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,062
All right, that is cool.

225
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,163
Yeah, that's awesome.

226
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:36,996
Legit.

227
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,474
Oh.

228
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,047
Oh, what the fuck was that?

229
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,416
We're here.

230
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,832
You've got to be kidding me.

231
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,534
It's all part of the game.

232
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,171
Kinky.

233
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,610
Well, I'm too buzzed to care
at this point anyway, so...

234
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,148
I'm so nervous. / I got this, babe.

235
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,282
Ugh.

236
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,518
I'm so ready.

237
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,189
All right. Let's do this.

238
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,458
There's a team player. / Whoo-hoo!

239
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:42,462
Ow! Ha ha! / Lock hands, everyone.

240
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,862
I don't want to lose you
when I lead you out.

241
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,299
Whoo!

242
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,336
Yeah! This is awesome.

243
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,104
Whoo-hoo!

244
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,139
You're not wearing one?

245
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:55,242
Somebody's got to be in charge.

246
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,377
Isn't that cheating?

247
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,713
I don't cheat.

248
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,086
But it's all part of the game.

249
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,161
This is crazy.

250
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,129
Where's your hand, Tabby?

251
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,897
Both your hands are on my ass.

252
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,699
That's exactly right.

253
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,202
Jesus! / Okay, is everyone ready?

254
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,536
Yeah, let's do it.

255
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,272
Wait, Tyler, where's your hand?

256
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,140
I'm... I'm right here.

257
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,509
Jesus! / Well, that sounds safe.

258
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,312
It's fine, you guys.
Don't touch your blindfolds.

259
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,813
She swat me like a dog? /
Yes, I did. You know what?

260
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,549
If you behaved, I wouldn't have to.

261
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:45,757
I'm so turned on right now.

262
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,460
Okay, shh, everyone!

263
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,231
You have one hour.

264
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,260
All right.

265
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,198
Ow!

266
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,293

/ I'm talking to Christen.

She's tying something to my hands.

274
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,870
Yeah, she tied something
to my wrists, too.

275
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:13,373

how about if I do...
No.

331
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:39,178
Okay, let's... / Just stop, Anderson.

332
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,018
I'm trying to figure this out.

333
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,555
Yeah, well, it's obviously not working.

334
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:51,791
It's a fucking puzzle.
There must be another solution.

335
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,660
Like what?

336
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,665
We have to work together, okay?

337
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,001
Fine.

338
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,605
All right.

339
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,707
Okay, what did we do
before that hasn't worked?

340
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,542
Like, we need to rethink this thing.

341
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:13,613
Well, we can't untie it.
We can't go around each other.

342
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,584
How about if we go through it?

343
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,018
Through it?

344
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,688
Yeah, like this.
Like through it. Like through.

345
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,657
Like this.
Like through.

346
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,059
What? No, that's not right. / Yeah.

347
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:33,933
Oh, no, no, no. You were
definitely on to something here.

350
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,091
Tabby, it's part of the game.
You gotta figure it out.

351
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,709
So there's a reason they put

352
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,711
this horrible thing on you?

353
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:45,678
Yeah, it's a clue.

354
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:50,216
All right, so we have
to figure out a number

355
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,285

pair of underwear ever.

♪ Take me back to dear... ♪

366
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,690
Nice!

367
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:34,727
All right, let's find a key
to unlock this shit.

368
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:38,330
Yeah. Let's do that.

369
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,699
So there are four numbers.

370
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:43,202
Let's assume A is one, B is two,
and A-B-C.

371
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,972
You can't go higher than nine.
/ This is complicated.

372
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,365
All right, babe, let's brainstorm.

373
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:50,276
Why would I be wearing this belt?

374
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,145
Mm... sex is definitely
out of the question.

375
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,682
I think you nailed it.

376
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:56,955
I'm definitely not nailing you.

377
00:26:56,983 --> 00:26:58,349
No, babe, what's a four letter word

378
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,820
that has to do with sex?

379
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,821
"Fuck?"

380
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,023
Uh-uh.

381
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,795
That's too many digits.

382
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,229
"Kink?"

383
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,597
Oh, wait!
What about head?

384
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,934
Okay, maybe we can talk about
that after we're done with this.

385
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,736
No, babe, that's the answer.

386
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,970
Oh.

387
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:23,743
Okay, so H.
So... H, so eight.

388
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,715
So E... / Babe.

389
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,417
Yeah? / Five.

390
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,785
All right.

391
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:38,891
A is one. Okay.

392
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:41,894
And D... Fuck. / Four.

393
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,735
Ah! / Yeah!

394
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:54,273
Oh!

395
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,710
We did it. / Yeah, we did.
Now, I'm gonna do it.

396
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:01,948
Oh, I like it.

397
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,482
Ah! / Anderson.

398
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,485
Fuck! Tyler?

399
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,154
You all right?

400
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,491
Yeah, the fucking thing cut me
in the finger when it opened.

401
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:47,827
Is Natasha with you? / I'm right here.

402
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,197
Is Christen with you? / No, I'm alone.

403
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,300
Oh, that sucks.

404
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,935
Is there a knob on your side?

405
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,838
Um... no.

406
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,506
Just a latch to this compartment.

407
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,775
Guessing you're knobless as well?

408
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,777
Just a combination dial.

409
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,445
What's the story in that room?

410
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,880
I don't know.

411
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,117
Thought it was decorated
by a bipolar novelist.

412
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,985
Oh. / Where are you?

413
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,789
My room is filled
with antique televisions

414
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,858
and out of sync clocks,
too many to count.

415
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:23,963
Ah. Aside from some Davy Crockett shit,

416
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:27,099
we have clocks in here, too. / Huh.

417
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:31,871
Uh, they don't seem
to be working, though.

418
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:34,240
How many are there?

419
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:36,775
Four.

420
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:42,214
And all of them are stopped?
/ Looks like it.

421
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:45,517
They're all stopped on an hour.

422
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,351
Okay, are they all stopped
on different hours?

423
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:50,056
Yes.

424
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,925
Okay. Tell me the times on the clocks.

425
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,362
Uh, 12 and six,

426
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,464
five, and eight.

427
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:07,206
Damn it.

428
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,978
Okay, where are the clocks?

429
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,981
I don't know.
All over the room.

430
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,082
What?

431
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,217
There are two on the
left hand side of the door

432
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,285
and two on the other.

433
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,087
All right, of the clocks on the left,

434
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,921
what is the time on the one
furthest from the door?

435
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,090
Uh, 12.

436
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:29,660
And the first clock
on the right hand side?

437
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,530
Uh, five.

438
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,401
Second one on the left?

439
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,336
Six.

440
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,874
And the last one on the right.

441
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,375
And eight.

442
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,887
Shit.

443
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:58,124
You did it.

444
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,558
No problem.

445
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,329
Wow, fashionable. / Yeah.

446
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,397
We'll see.

447
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,500
Guys.

448
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,076
All right.

449
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,578
It works.

450
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,094
Hey, there's a card here.

451
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,328
Wonder what it's doing there.

452
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:40,599
Is it a piece to a puzzle?
/ I don't know.

453
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,667
Yeah...

454
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,907
Is this... Is this how you took it out?

455
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:54,947
Now what?

456
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,152
Yikes.

457
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:01,988
Exactly.

458
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,256
Well, the only way out is the exit door,

459
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,225
which I assume will open when we win.

460
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,027
If we win.

461
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:12,398
Anderson. Come on.

462
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,067
We just killed that first puzzle
without breaking a sweat.

463
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,036
Don't you want to win?

464
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,037
We're going to get out of here in
record time. Just get on board.

465
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,073
All right. Lead the way, birthday boy.

466
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,508
But how do you suspect we're gonna
find the others if there are no doors?

467
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,544
It's all gotta be part of the game.

468
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:31,650
What are you looking for?
/ I don't know.

469
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,120
That narrows it down.

470
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,022
Oh, come on, Anderson.

471
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,557
There has to be something
that leads to the next thing.

472
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,392
You know, like a clue?

473
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,161
Oh, really?

474
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:44,330
So do you mind enlightening me, then?

475
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,667
All right.

476
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,472
Okay, well, how about these?

477
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,076
They're a series of
animal paintings in a line.

478
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,745
So what?

479
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,114
So it could be a clue!
I don't know.

480
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,982
Yes!

481
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,229
I bet it's based on weight.
Take those off.

482
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,530
Oh, yeah.

483
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,672
It's the food chain.

484
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,074
Brilliant.
Trade me.

485
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,045
Rabbit.

486
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,382
Fox. / Coyote.

487
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,786
Whoa. What?

488
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,097
Seriously?

489
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,132
Slackers.

490
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:55,801
Typical.

491
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,607
Hi. Oh, yeah?

492
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,375
You guys busy? / Hmm?

493
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,576
We can't hear you.

494
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,180
We can't hear you.

495
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,253
We... we can't hear you.

496
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,823
Oh, my God.

497
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,126
It's like he doesn't know
it's my sister.

498
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:27,866
Hey, where do you think
that door leads to?

499
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,236
Well, it looks like it's connected
to the other room.

500
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,829
But there is no door in the other room.

501
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,038
I know that,

502
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,507
but you're telling me that
doesn't look like it's connected?

503
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,775
Oh, it's definitely connected.

504
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,792
What're you doing?

505
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:03,302
Oh! / Whoa!

506
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,505
Wow. Fuck.

507
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,675
Ah.

508
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:14,580
Oh, so there was a door.

509
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:22,421
Here.

510
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,161
Thank you. / You're welcome.

511
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,165
All right, let's
get rid of these clocks.

512
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,306
Okay, so where's the key?

513
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,544
How about the ones
that unlocked the ropes?

514
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,513
Ah. Yeah.

515
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:01,159
Stop it.

516
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,764
What? Come on.

517
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,840
There's no way this is gonna fit.

518
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:15,974
Nice.

519
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,310
It was your fucking idea.

520
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:19,877
Look, there's gotta be
a key here somewhere,

521
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,213
let's just find it.

522
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:24,383
Oh, my God.

523
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,388
Would you just... / God.

524
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,404
Hey, hey, look for a clock
that only has a minute hand.

525
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:49,575
Why? / Just fucking do it, Anderson.

526
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:52,878
Okay.
Here, got it.

527
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:57,349
This clock only has a minute hand.

528
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,333
Okay. / What the hell
is up with these clocks?

529
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,024
Here, here, here.

530
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,594
All right, what the fuck?

531
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,265
If I...

532
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,513
Hm.

533
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,486
That's impressive. / Very impressive.

534
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:45,631
Here, help me.

535
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,338
Ah? / Yes!

536
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:55,674
Yeah! Hey, guys.

537
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,007
You're my hero. Thank you. / Hey.

538
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,209
You guys rescued us.

539
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,646
Yeah, any longer and someone's
pants'd be on the floor.

540
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,415
She's wearing a skirt.
/ That is correct.

541
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,783
Oh, gross.

542
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,420
What the fuck?

543
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,659
Uh...

544
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,547
Is that Christen?

545
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,483
Oh, my God!

546
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,487
Where is she?

547
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,855
Yeah, things just got weird.

548
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:47,793
Wow.

549
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,361
What?

550
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:54,099
It's all part of the game.

551
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:01,139
This is fucking cool.

552
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,443
Look, look. We have
41 minutes to rescue Christen.

553
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,544
That's the game.

554
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,718
Christen said we had an hour.

555
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,585
Well, the timer must have started
when we got here.

556
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,955
It was probably me.
I flipped the switch over there.

557
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,490
Oh.

558
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,461
Why isn't she in here with us?

559
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,563
Why would she lock herself
in a cage somewhere?

560
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,998
I don't know, Anderson.
That's what we have to figure out.

561
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,439
Fine.
Whatever.

562
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:36,007
At least we know what we're
playing for now, right?

563
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,909
Bingo. That's the can-do attitude

564
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,109
we like to hear from you, Anderson.

565
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,179
Now, time is of the essence.

566
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,481
So, it's a good thing I know
exactly what we have to do next.

567
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:44,616
Check it out.

568
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:50,889
What happened?

569
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,123
What do you mean?

570
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,858
Weren't there squares with
letters on them right here?

571
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,694
Oh, yeah, there were.

572
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,696
Yeah, but they were
there the whole time.

573
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,964
Are you sure about that?

574
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,330
'Cause you guys were just
sucking a whole bunch of face.

575
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:04,770
Yeah, well, when was the last
time you two sucked face? Huh?

576
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,538
Look, as soon as we got out of the room,

577
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,007
it must have disappeared.

578
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,976
It's probably the door. Huh?

579
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:17,583
Hey.

580
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:22,588
Wait!
Shut it again.

581
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,960
Oh, wow, I bet you
have to spell something.

582
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,864
Yeah, but what?

583
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,833
There's got to be something.

584
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:41,172
Oh, that...
What the fuck is that?

585
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,643
Nice.

586
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,912
Was that thing strapped to your junk?

587
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,113
It sure was.

588
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,148
She released the Kraken. / Oh!

589
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,519
Well, I'm not getting it.

590
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:56,588
Getting what? / It's another card.

591
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,625
Oh. / Mm-hmm.

592
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,792
Fuck it.

593
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,395
Ugh.

594
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,532
Guys, come on.
It was on the outside of my pants.

595
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:08,233
He's clean.
I would know.

596
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,868
Excellent.

597
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,003
Well, I don't see any other clues here,

598
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:15,006
so let's keep focused.

599
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,677
Go. Go, go, go. / Yeah.

600
00:41:31,557 --> 00:41:33,559
Well, it obviously wants
us to spell something,

601
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,561
so... / How big a word?

602
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,997
Nine letters? / Nine letters?
Fuck, big word.

603
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:46,104
It's like an answer
to a crossword puzzle.

604
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,505
Oh, you love crossword puzzles.

605
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,976
He does.

606
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,082
And the answer is
in one of these newspapers.

607
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,049
Yes.

608
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,655
We don't have time
to go through all of these.

609
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:06,658
All right, some of us
look for crosswords

610
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:07,692
while the others look for clues.

611
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:08,894
You know, get a system going.

612
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:09,967
That's gonna take forever.

613
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,161
There has to be some kind of order.

614
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:14,099
Oh, what if there's
a clue in a headline?

615
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,770
Well, theme in this one is dead
celebrities, if that helps.

616
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:21,239
Well, did any of them
die on today's date?

617
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,142
Maybe that's a fucking clue.

618
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,144
The dates.

619
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,846
That's actually not a bad idea.

620
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,149
Nice, Christen.

621
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,150
My birthday.

622
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,686
Look for today's date
30 years ago. / Yes.

623
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:42,728
This stack is all 1990s.

624
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,964
'70s.

625
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,397
Oh! I got the '80s.

626
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,001
Perfect. / Yes!

627
00:42:50,035 --> 00:42:51,770
Okay...

628
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:58,610
All right, who's got October 13th?

629
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,821
Ah, got it.

630
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:10,922
Yes, right here.

631
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,260
That's it.

632
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:18,864
All right, it wants one word.

633
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,766
All right, how many letters? / Nine.

634
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:24,069
Nice. / All right, the clue is...

635
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,638
"narcissistic notes."

636
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,776
Interesting.

637
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,310
I'm glad we got an easy one.

638
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,186
All right, well, uh, shut me in the room

639
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,787
and I'll put in words
until I figure it out.

640
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:43,722
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

641
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:46,057
We started in there.
Let us take this one.

642
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:47,726
Tyler.

643
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,693
Conrad, this is gonna involve

644
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:50,195
some quick problem-solving on the fly

645
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,130
and I'm not really sure
that's your forte.

646
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,232
Whoa, whoa.

647
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,434
What?

648
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,737
You can let someone else
do something, Tyler.

649
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,307
All right.

650
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:05,811
All right.

651
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,813
Oh! I got it.

652
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,648
"Egomaniac."

653
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,453
Actually, that could work.

654
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,422
Yes.

655
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,235
Well...

656
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,945
Damn it.

657
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:42,848
Narcissistic notes.

658
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:46,785
Something about letters... memos.

659
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:47,819
Ego's memos.

660
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,254
That has an apostrophe.

661
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:52,724
So? / So it's definitely not the answer.

662
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:59,397
Oh. What if note isn't to do
with something written?

663
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,832
What'd you mean?

664
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,101
Like a musical note?

665
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,070
Like what is a narcissistic's song?

666
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:08,206
Oh, looks like Anderson needs a hug.

667
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,408
Oh, what about egotistic?

668
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,441
Yeah, I'll try it.

669
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,178
Oh!

670
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,513
What is Carly Simon's "You're So Vain"?

671
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,148
That definitely won't fit.

672
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,851
Also, this isn't Jeopardy, so...

673
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:23,221
Well, you come up with
something, smart guy.

674
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,190
Whatever it is, it's your theme song.

675
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,424
What did you say? / Huh?

676
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,895
Nothing, just that my wife is
stuck up and she doesn't know...

677
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,196
No, not that. / I love you.

678
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,504
Try this.

679
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,206
T.

680
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,375
T? Okay, T. / Yes.

681
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:49,147
H. / H.

682
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,317
E. / E.

683
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:56,287
M. E.

684
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:02,760
Theme song.

685
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,396
Theme song. / A-B-C-D-E-F...

686
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,573
Yes!

687
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,542
Yes!

688
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,410
Yes!

689
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,846
Ha!

690
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,517
Nice. I'll go let 'em out.

691
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:34,826
If they want to get out. /
I'll never get used to that.

692
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,295
Oh, who's the protective big brother?

693
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,463
Stop.

694
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,567
I love how when you pretend
to have a conscience...

695
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,938
I said fucking stop!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

696
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,862
Hey! Fuck!

697
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,439
What's wrong?

698
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,174
The key broke off in the fucking door.

699
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,141
What do you mean it broke?

700
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:27,612
I tried to open it and it wouldn't open.

701
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,448
Damn it. / You disappoint me.

702
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:33,118
Really, Anderson? / Jesus.

703
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:34,385
I don't see...

704
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,923
That's a little much.

705
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:41,659
Whoa! So fancy.

706
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:52,970
You're gonna have to sit tight

707
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:55,974
'til we can figure how to get you out.

708
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,249
Wait.

709
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,988
What's that?

710
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:25,003
It's all part of the game, right?

711
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:27,472
Yeah. That's weird.

712
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:28,673
What?

713
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,676
We solved the puzzle.
Why would the door close again?

714
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:32,677
Well, maybe...

715
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,715
maybe there's something else
that we have to do?

716
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,450
That doesn't make sense.

717
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,223
Wait.

718
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:49,961
Something's wrong.

719
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,537
What is that?

720
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,978
It looks like it's burning them.

721
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,251
Like... acid.

722
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,158
Oh, my God!

723
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,759
Oh!

724
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,029
Tabby! Tabby!

725
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:30,368
Holy shit! / What the fuck
is happening to them?

726
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:34,272
Tabby! No! / Oh, shit...

727
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,717
Tabby!

728
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:51,056
Ah! / Fuck!

729
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,224
Damn it!

730
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:55,526
What is happening? / Tabby!

731
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,165
Something's happening to them!

732
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,100
No! / Oh, my God!

733
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:02,899
Tabby! / Oh, my God!

734
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,104
Tabby!

735
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:08,606
Get down!
Get on the floor!

736
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,276
Oh, my God!

737
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,178
Tabby! / Oh, shit!

738
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,346
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! / Fuck! Fuck!

739
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,314
Oh, my God...

740
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,054
Holy shit. / Tabby!

741
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:25,190
Conrad! / What the fuck is going on?

742
00:50:25,223 --> 00:50:26,123
Oh, my God! / Tabby!

743
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,564
What is this?
What is this?

744
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:31,429
Tabby? Tabby!

745
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:35,766
Oh, my...
Oh, my God!

746
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,304
Fuck! / Fuck!

747
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,280
Fuck.

748
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:16,174
What the fuck is this place?

749
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,893
No.

750
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,732
What did you do?

751
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,170
I didn't...

752
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:23,774
I didn't do anything.

753
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,513
It locked on its own!

754
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,281
I-I-I tried to open it.

755
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:33,184
No, you fucked it up
and look what happened.

756
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:36,321
You couldn't do anything!
/ I tried to help them!

757
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:37,455
Look at you!

758
00:52:40,358 --> 00:52:42,327
I tried to help them.

759
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:11,789
No.

760
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,962
Don't hurt her.

761
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,309
No.

762
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,619
It's real.

763
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,823
It's all real. / Real?

764
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:49,627
What are you talking about?
Of c... of course...

765
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:54,365
Why would Christen bring us here?

766
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:55,766
Christen's in trouble, too.

767
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,968
Then why the fuck isn't
she in the room with us?

768
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:00,505
She's locked in a
fucking cage, Anderson!

769
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,007
Christ.

770
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:09,447
It's not a game.

771
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,615
We have to get out of here.

772
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,984
Help me!

773
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:14,952
Fuck!

774
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:25,663
Fuck! Fuck!
There's no way!

775
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,432
What? So... so we're trapped?

776
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,500
There's no puzzle to get us out of here?

777
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:31,602
Fuck these puzzles!

778
00:54:44,682 --> 00:54:46,917
All these rooms are enclosed.

779
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,456
Yeah. We figured that out
a long time ago.

780
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,649
What are you getting at? / Which means
there must be some sort of ventilation.

781
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:10,074
Here!

782
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,712
Fuck. / I'm here.

783
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,381
Take this.

784
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,360
We have to go.

785
00:55:29,394 --> 00:55:32,363
No way.
No fucking way!

786
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:34,731
Do you want to get out of here?

787
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,466
Did you see what just
happened to Conrad and Tabby?

788
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:37,867
There's got to be another
way to open up the door.

789
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,903
Do you really want to wait
around and figure it out?

790
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:41,506
What if there is
no way to open the door?

791
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,672
What if it's just a matter of time

792
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,809
until this entire place
fills up with more acid fog

793
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,411
and we fucking fry, Anderson?

794
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:47,845
I'm going.

795
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,718
What? / I'm going.

796
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,352
We're going.

797
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,504
Tash. / I got... I gotta go.

798
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:26,551
Okay. Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

799
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,430
The vent turns.

800
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:41,532
Just keep moving.

801
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:45,936
I'm coming!
I'm right behind you.

802
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,006
Anderson! / Fuck!

803
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,026
There's something up ahead.

804
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,695
Like it could be an opening.

805
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,809
Anderson.

806
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,618
What?

807
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:35,119
It's another fucking puzzle.

808
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,731
Fuck is with this shit?!

809
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:48,566
Let's just go back!

810
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:50,800
No! There's a puzzle, we'll solve
it, we'll get out of here.

811
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,638
Get out of my way! / Shit!

812
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:56,073
Jesus!

813
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,575
Fuck!

814
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:59,777
Shit!

815
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,610
It's fine, we're getting out.
We just gotta...

816
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:02,980
we gotta...

817
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,982
I don't understand this.

818
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:07,652
Okay. Maybe it's...

819
00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:09,787
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

820
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,255
Shit. / Why the fuck...

821
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:13,924
God damn it, Natasha! / I didn't know!

822
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,693
Fuck! / Move!

823
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,595
Help... Let me see it!
Let me see it! / Fuck!

824
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,229
Shut up! Fuck. / Fuck.

825
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,330
Move! / No!

826
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:22,700
Fuck! / Just let me see it.
I can do this.

827
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,635
No, shut up! / Tyler!

828
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:26,302
Fuck! / Move, he's good at these things.

829
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,539
Fuck.

830
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:30,040
It's the Greek riddle of the Sphinx.

831
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,544
Well, then answer it. / Hang on!

832
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,185
Did you hear that? / What?

833
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,687
What? / Just, shh!

834
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,823
Just listen.
You hear it?

835
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:50,661
Yeah, I hear it.

836
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,263
Oh, my God, it's getting louder.

837
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,800
Anderson! / It's getting louder!

838
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,067
Anderson! / Okay, okay, okay.

839
00:58:57,101 --> 00:59:00,104
Um, find a sun. / Okay.

840
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:02,673
Put it next to the sunrise.

841
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:03,540
Good, good. Next.

842
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:05,610
Now find a star and put it next to that.

843
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,013
Yes! / All right.

844
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,079
Next one, next one. Come on!

845
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,081
An infant. / What?

846
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:13,584
A baby! A fucking baby! / Okay, where?

847
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:14,919
Put it next to that.

848
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,954
Okay. Next.
Next one, come on!

849
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,956
All right. / Hurry! Just hurry!

850
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,926
An old man! / Here, here, here!

851
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:24,662
Fuck.

852
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,731
Fuck! / What?

853
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,600
What the? Something just
shut the duct behind me.

854
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:31,736
Are you okay? / No! What the fuck is it?

855
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:34,004
Oh, my God!

856
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:37,675
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! / Come on!

857
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,143
My leg is stuck. / Go!

858
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,812
My leg is stuck!
My leg is stuck!

859
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:44,715
Help me! Help me!
Oh, my God! Help!

860
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,684
Oh, my God!

861
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,020
No.

862
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,383
Here!

863
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:24,822
No...

864
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,993
No!

865
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,816
Are you fucking serious?

866
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,428
Anderson!

867
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,130
Anderson, come on!

868
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,965
He's not coming.

869
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,274
We're gonna die in here.

870
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:20,845
We're gonna die in here.

871
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:22,179
We're gonna die.

872
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,392
He knew.

873
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,194
What?

874
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:40,430
Anderson knew.
He had to know.

875
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,469
I wanted him to know.

876
01:01:45,502 --> 01:01:47,805
I wanted him to get mad at me.

877
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,874
I wanted to feel something.

878
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:52,209
Jesus fucking Christ.

879
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:58,515
He never said anything.

880
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:05,022
Hey!

881
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,357
Pull your shit together!

882
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,137
Oh, my God.

883
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,874
Oh... oh, oh!

884
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:26,510
Oh, my God!

885
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:29,246
Why are all these wires
coming out of the TVs?

886
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:30,848
Tyler.

887
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:32,549
These. They're primary colors.

888
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,819
It's gotta be another
fucking puzzle, right?

889
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,053
I mean, look at them.

890
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:39,289
Yes.

891
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,892
Yellow and red make orange.

892
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:47,464
And blue and yellow make green.

893
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,533
And green and orange are left.

894
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:51,802
It has to be. Yes.

895
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:03,881
No!

896
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,820
What the fuck?

897
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:13,858
Fuck.

898
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:15,359
What do we do? / I don't know.

899
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:16,992
What the fuck do we do? / I don't know!

900
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,496
It's all part of the game, Tyler.

901
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:20,596
You always know the answer.

902
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:24,001
What the fuck do we do?
/ I said I don't know!

903
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:27,004
Exactly.
You don't know.

904
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:28,637
You think you're so
fucking perfect, Tyler.

905
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,739
Shut up.

906
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:31,507
You think Christen didn't see
through your bullshit,

907
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,543
that everyone didn't know
what you were doing.

908
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,980
Shut the fuck up!

909
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:39,516
She knew.

910
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:48,458
"Teddy Bear Picnic." / What?

911
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:53,497
Only Christen would know
that I fucking hate that song.

912
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,278
Oh, fuck.

913
01:04:11,048 --> 01:04:12,416
Fuck!

914
01:04:18,055 --> 01:04:19,856
We only have three minutes. / Shut up!

915
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:27,965
I feel something.
There's a handle.

916
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:33,637
Thank God.

917
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,909
Oh.
Fuck, fuck!

918
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:41,011
It locked again. / Shit!

919
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,119
Yes!

920
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:53,057
Oh, shit!

921
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,997
Fuck!

922
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,232
Fuck! Fuck!

923
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:07,504
What? / The door's too heavy,
I can't open it.

924
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,573
Come do this.

925
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,675
I'll open the goddamned door.

926
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,913
Okay.

927
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:23,487
I think I feel something.

928
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,989
Do it!

929
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:33,363
What happened?

930
01:05:35,132 --> 01:05:39,103
The mouth started closing on my arm.

931
01:05:39,136 --> 01:05:41,271
You hold it, I'll hold the door open,

932
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,407
and when I say "go," you run.

933
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:46,709
There's no time to waste, Natasha!

934
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,646
Okay, okay!
Jesus.

935
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,550
Now!

936
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,370
It's closing! It's closing!

937
01:06:13,403 --> 01:06:15,439
It's closing, Tyler!
It's closing!

938
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,507
Just a little bit more! /
It's closing on my arm!

939
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:21,111
It's closing on my arm, Tyler!

940
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:23,247
Oh, it's closing!

941
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,640
Just a little more.

942
01:06:26,216 --> 01:06:28,518
Oh, my God! Hurry!

943
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:32,189
It's cutting my arm, Tyler!

944
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,158
Stop, Tyler!
It's gonna break my arm.

945
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:35,325
Stop opening it!

946
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,392
It's closing, it's closing!

947
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:37,627
I'm sorry.

948
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,764
Fuck!

949
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,445
Fuck!

950
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:59,643
Christen.

951
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:02,146
Can you hear me? / Yes.

952
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:05,215
Are you okay?

953
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,486
I'm fine. / Okay.

954
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:11,488
What is this, Christen?

955
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,758
What?

956
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,395
What is this?

957
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,763
What are you talking about?

958
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,166
Why did you bring us here?

959
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,267
What do you mean?

960
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,869
Why did you bring us here?

961
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:28,438
I didn't do anything.

962
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:31,175
I didn't know. I wasn't...

963
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:37,847
Have you been watching this whole time?

964
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:39,883
Tyler..

965
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,218
Saw them all die?

966
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:43,287
Is that your fucking idea?

967
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:46,456
Did you plan that?

968
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:49,293
They're all dead because of you.

969
01:08:49,326 --> 01:08:52,229
I... How could you say that?

970
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:54,464
Don't, Tyler. It's...

971
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:55,364
How could you say that?

972
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:58,802
My sister is dead.
My sister is dead!

973
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:02,672
Because of you.
Is this some sort of sick joke?

974
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,277
No. / Tell me.

975
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:13,183
Tyler. / Oh, oh.

976
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:15,419
So I assume you had... you had
nothing to do with this?

977
01:09:15,452 --> 01:09:17,487
No! I woke up in this cage.

978
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:19,289
I don't fucking believe you, Christen.

979
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:22,326
I just want this to be over.

980
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,494
You think I can't tell
when you're lying to me?

981
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,229
I didn't do anything.
/ I'm so... I'm so...

982
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:30,334
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I-I can't hear you, Christen.

983
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,237
You know, because I can't hear
anything over fucking lies!

984
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,703
Tyler, what's happening? / You're lying!

985
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:36,806
Believe me! / There's no time, Christen.

986
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,877
Tyler! / No! Say it!

987
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,846
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

988
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:44,548
Why did you fucking bring us here?

989
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:47,251
There's no time, Christen!
Say it!

990
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:50,354
Say it!

991
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:54,458
Say it!

992
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:55,959
Now! Say it!

993
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:58,228
Tyler!

994
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:08,938
Oh... No!

995
01:10:16,346 --> 01:10:19,249
No!

996
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:31,295
I don't know how to get to you.

997
01:10:31,328 --> 01:10:34,464
Tyler.
What do I do?

998
01:10:34,498 --> 01:10:35,799
What do I have to do?

999
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,535
I love you.

1000
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,636
911, state your emergency?

1001
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:30,106
Yes...

1002
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,140
Tell me what's going on.

1003
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,543
I was... I was taken.

1004
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:36,546
My friends... I-I-I think
they were, um...

1005
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,782
I don't know where they are.
/ Okay, ma'am, ma'am?

1006
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,683
I think they were maybe...
/ I need you to slow down.

1007
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:43,587
Can't tell where I am. /
Take a deep breath for me.

1008
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,655
Okay, I show you're on the corner

1009
01:13:45,689 --> 01:13:48,892
of Central and East Third Avenue.

1010
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,227
I'm sending a patrol car
now to help you.

1011
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,530
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. / Okay?

1012
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:55,230
I need you to stay on the line
with me, all right?

1013
01:13:55,231 --> 01:13:57,501
Can you do that? / Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1014
01:13:57,534 --> 01:14:00,537
Okay, what is your name?

1015
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,972
Christen Wills.

1016
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:05,041
And what happened, Christen?

1017
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:09,178
We went to an escape room.

1018
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:12,215
It was my boyfriend's birthday,
and um...

1019
01:14:12,248 --> 01:14:13,583
Hello?

1020
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:27,063
Tyler was right.

1021
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:29,065
They're all dead because of you.

1022
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:35,138
Who is this?

1023
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,241
Why?

1024
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:42,946
Oh, no. Who I am is not
important at all.

1025
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,650
No, but why... That is.

1026
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:48,552
What do you mean?

1027
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:52,021
You went looking for this.

1028
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:53,990
Remember?

1029
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,526
You do not hang up on me.

1030
01:14:57,894 --> 01:14:59,629
Don't do it.

1031
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,738
Hi, there.

1032
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,577
I'm watching you.

1033
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:24,654
You found exactly what you
were looking for, didn't you?

1034
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:27,223
A night of escape.

1035
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,992
I let you watch.

1036
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:34,330
You have one hour.

1037
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,704
The police are coming.

1038
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:45,642
Listen, when the cops get there,
just do me a favor.

1039
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:49,813
I want you to tell 'em everything,

1040
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:55,619
but if you and I are being
honest with each other?

1041
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:02,726
I gotta tell ya, I doubt
they're gonna believe you.

1042
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:09,298
You really can't help
yourselves, can you?

1043
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:13,770
You people are so naïve.

1044
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:16,005
It's all part of the game, remember?

1045
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:19,042
Who are you?
What did you do?

1046
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:23,680
You should ask yourself this, Christen.

1047
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,152
Who really escapes?

1048
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,153
Was it you?

1049
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,724
Or was it them?

1050
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:48,304
...stay on the line.

1051
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:51,675
Christen, can you hear me?

1052
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:54,310
Ma'am, I need you to say
something if you can hear me.

1053
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:57,446
Units are almost there.

1054
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,916
If you can hear me,
you are going to be okay.

1055
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,952
Stay with me, Christen.

1056
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:04,253
Stay with me.
