1
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,538
Things are going to be different now.

2
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,775
Are they?

3
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,309
I'm going to take care of you.

4
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,917
No more hospitals,

5
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,314
no more nightmares.

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,318
Just you and me together forever.

7
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,821
I want you to feel good about who you are.

8
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,754
I want you to feel safe.

9
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,366
Not a very clinical thing to say, Doc.

10
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,564
I must sound like I'm completely crazy.

11
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:13,830
Maybe you're just a good liar.

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:14,665
And what have I done?

13
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,076
That's not me anymore.

14
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,678
That's all in the past.

15
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,946
Past, present, future.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,443
It's all in your head.

17
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,320
It's not the same, it's not,

18
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,655
it's not real.

19
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,360
It's not, it's not real.

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,495
It's not real.

21
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,367
Where, where, where is my daughter,
is my daughter, where is she?

22
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,130
She's all alone.

23
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,202
In a dark, lonely place.

24
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,139
Where is this dark, lonely place?

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,181
Time.

26
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,243
She's very scared.

27
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,887
Let's just get on with this.

28
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,648
Where is she?

29
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,661
You're a psychic, you're a psychic,
where is she?

30
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,461
I can see her now.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,338
In the bright, white room.

32
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,101
I thought you said a dark, lonely place.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,448
Time change things.

34
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,780
She's gone.

35
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,216
Gone?

36
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,580
What, what do you mean she's gone?

37
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,450
Lucille, that was my name.

38
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,628
Wait, no. No, no, no.

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,329
What's happening, happening,

40
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,057
this is very,
this is very, very, very bad. Please.

41
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,198
Yes, it is.

42
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,634
It is very, very bad for you.

43
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,476
My brother died when I was ten.

44
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,770
Daddy never forgave me.

45
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:07,747
And it begged the question,
when innocence is lost, what's left behind?

46
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,784
I just want to go home.

47
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,652
I want to go, want to go, want to go home.

48
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,026
Some call it a curse.

49
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,393
I call it inevitable.

50
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,935
I don't want to die.

51
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,231
I don't want to die.

52
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,668
I got a family.

53
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,470
I got a family,
I have children for Christ's sakes.

54
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,839
Pull me up, please, I,

55
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,514
I've got the money, you know. I,

56
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,444
I, we could work something out you guys.

57
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,216
Thomas.

58
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,456
He had me committed
to save me from myself.

59
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,316
Never told his boss.

60
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,164
It's the one piece of information
that could save his life.

61
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,433
Sid, hired muscle,
but it gets more complicated.

62
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,569
We know, that's why we're here,

63
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,468
that's why you're hanging over the edge
of this fucking building.

64
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,079
Antoine's a goon.
Frankly, it doesn't get less complicated.

65
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,042
Here, it's for you.

66
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,477
You lousy rat piece of fucking shit.

67
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,344
You think you can steal from me?
Listen, please, please, this...

68
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,646
Do you think you can steal
from me and get away with it?

69
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,288
- I, I swear to god I didn't...
- Shut up.

70
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,952
Shut the fuck up.

71
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,856
I trusted you,

72
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,790
and you violated that trust.

73
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,226
Now I'm going to punish you.

74
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,761
I don't even care where the money is.

75
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,061
I don't care where the money is.

76
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,771
I don't give a fuck about it.

77
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,434
You can keep it.

78
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,766
- Oh, no.
- Merry Christmas.

79
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,945
Have fun, spend it in hell mother...

80
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,942
How, how'd it go?

81
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,377
guys, just call him back,
call him back, please.

82
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,347
What for?
He's fucking done with you, buddy.

83
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,555
If you want to talk to me, you want to...
There is fucking nothing

84
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,520
that's going to make us...

85
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,484
No, I swear to god, I swear to god,
you want to talk...

86
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,319
Are you fucking calling him?
Yeah, I'm kind 0f curious to what he has to say.

87
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,153
Cocksucker.

88
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,866
What?

89
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,296
Mr. Van Sant,

90
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,735
I, I know where she is,

91
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,402
You know. Yeah, I got your attention now,
don't I?

92
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,168
Where? Where? Where is she?

93
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,345
No.

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,016
No, no, you, you got to, you got to
get these guys to let me go first.

95
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,884
I just let you go, didn't I? I said, fine.

96
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,955
If I didn't, I meant to. You can go.
Where is she?

97
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,752
No, no,
I'll tell you as soon as you let me go.

98
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,559
No deal.

99
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,094
I'll let you go...

100
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:35,926
What?

101
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,363
when you tell me where she is.

102
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,365
Shit.

103
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:40,934
Okay, okay,

104
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,769
I'll tell you what, um, um, uh, okay,
then why don't I tell you,

105
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,275
and then you let me go?

106
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,477
Whoa.

107
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,786
Conrad.

108
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,942
Hey, Antoine.

109
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,450
What are you doing here?

110
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,247
Came to see this fucker off.

111
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,254
Well how the fuck did you find us?

112
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,493
Van Sant told me where you guys were.

113
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,857
He wanted to make sure
the job got done right.

114
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,757
He didn't say nothing to us.

115
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,196
This idiot,

116
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,172
he works for us for ten years,
then he steals a shit load of money,

117
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,899
and then has the audacity to
try to bribe me with it.

118
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,372
Well I'm surprised you didn't take it.

119
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,012
He didn't offer that much, did you?

120
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,146
So

121
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,478
back off,

122
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,744
let me put one in him.

123
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,546
Whoa, whoa, Conrad, fuck man,
take it easy.

124
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,222
Hey, you know the rules, homes.

125
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,014
What rules?

126
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,953
We find him, we get to kill him.

127
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,023
Really?

128
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,152
Hey, hey, Conrad,

129
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,995
look how, how about 50 percent, huh?

130
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,768
Fuck you.

131
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,672
Okay, 75 percent, okay?
I need some for the girl.

132
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,774
Do I look like I could give a shit
about some girl?

133
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,773
Okay, uh, g0 percent?

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,211
g0 percent.

135
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,017
Hey, that's some fucked up shit, homes.

136
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:01,879
Alright, dickhead,

137
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,486
take their guns.

138
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,747
What, what? What?

139
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,720
Come on.

140
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,618
Dude.

141
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,792
Bring them to me.

142
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,461
Hey, okay.

143
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,492
He doesn't pack.

144
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,527
Get over here.

145
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,392
Eat death!

146
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,467
Hey, man, that's my fucking gun.

147
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,280
I can't get a clear shot.

148
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,025
I can't get a clear shot.

149
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,633
Ow, shit.

150
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,743
Oh, fuck.

151
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:34,435
Damn it.

152
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,612
Ow.

153
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,046
Yeah, right, so what?
You guys are going to kill me?

154
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,378
I don't think so.

155
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,752
What?

156
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,382
Get the...
fellas, come on, I told, I told you,

157
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,219
okay, okay, a hundred percent,

158
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll give you a hundred percent.
Shut up.

159
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,757
I, I know where the girl is.

160
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,465
She's in the Patton State Hospital.

161
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:09,747
For every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

162
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,520
What goes around comes around.

163
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,513
When people try to help me,

164
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,554
they die.

165
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,949
Angel.

166
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:47,743
How you doing, my brother?

167
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,751
Good, nice to see you, man.
Care to join us?

168
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,224
Good. I like what you've done
with this place, man.

169
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,517
This is really, really nice.

170
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,785
Oh, man, we trying to take it
to the next level, baby.

171
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,189
Yeah, so, Mary.

172
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:58,860
Hi.

173
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,191
Anne, Jeanette, Lisa.

174
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,958
My girls, what do you think?

175
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,537
I'll take all of 'em.

176
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,848
I'll be right back.

177
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:22,816
Who the fuck are you?

178
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:23,851
Whoa, huh?

179
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,613
You got a problem?

180
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,018
I got a problem with you and this low rent
whorehouse you're running, here.

181
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,524
So you pay the whores to mingle
with the customers,

182
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,594
and make sure that they get lucky?

183
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,624
That's ingenious.

184
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,143
You're so cute...
Hey, Jaymee girl.

185
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,579
So, uh, who are your friends?

186
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,779
Well, um, this is Frankie,
and this is Jay.

187
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,451
Would you?

188
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,052
For real?

189
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,453
Come on.

190
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,438
You mind telling me where you're going?

191
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,843
Hey, Angel.

192
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,284
I was just getting some air.

193
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:08,093
Those guys was watching your ass
practically all night, huh?

194
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,765
They think I'm an easy score.

195
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,260
Nadine.

196
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:28,406
I just can't do this anymore, okay?

197
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,040
I just want to go back and

198
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,316
finish school.

199
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,021
And this is,

200
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,887
this is just too hard.

201
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,328
So stop crying.

202
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,326
It's messing your makeup up.

203
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,196
Angel,

204
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,600
can I do something else for you?

205
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,668
I know I can do anything you want,
I just,

206
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,178
I can't, I can't take this anymore.
Please.

207
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,447
Please, let me do something normal.

208
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,982
I understand.

209
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,882
But until I get a fresh bitch
around here,

210
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,488
I got to get my money.

211
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,089
I need you.

212
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,853
We'll talk about this later, alright?

213
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,202
What's happening?

214
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,536
Where the fuck are you?

215
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,581
You know where I'm at, I'm working.

216
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,977
What happened to coming over?

217
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,913
I'll come by tomorrow,
I'm busy right now.

218
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,213
Fuck that shit, you're always busy,
you're such an asshole.

219
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,889
I'll talk to you later.

220
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,319
Fuck.

221
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,459
Angel and Daddy used to work together.

222
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,802
Apparently one of them
developed a conscience.

223
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,435
Nobody knows which one.

224
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,467
Good job today.

225
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,036
Glad both those fuckers are dead.

226
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,740
But I have something
I need you to do for me

227
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,068
more important than anything
I've ever asked you to do before.

228
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,903
I need you to find somebody for me.

229
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,807
She's a plague to humanity.

230
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,312
Poisonous. A curse to my own existence.

231
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,744
A curse to your own existence?

232
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,351
A curse, a curse, okay?

233
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,611
A curse.

234
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,153
I'd still have a son
if it weren't for this, for her.

235
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,755
She, on the other hand, was a,

236
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,093
well actually a fucking lousy accident.

237
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:22,794
She's your daughter.

238
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,757
No shit, you dumb motherfucker.

239
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,555
You've been listening.

240
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,766
So you want us to knock off our daughter.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,297
What kind of person do you think I am,
have my own daughter killed?

242
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,502
Have her found, she escaped.

243
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,599
Escaped from where?

244
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,498
The institute. The institute.

245
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:34,773
Why do you think I'm still alive, huh?

246
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,842
Well I won't be for long if you guys
don't find her and keep her away from me.

247
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,103
Please.

248
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,008
Just remember, don't help her.

249
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,115
If you do, you die, okay?

250
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,876
And you won't see it coming.

251
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,451
We already know she was at the institute.

252
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,053
They don't have much there anymore.

253
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,054
The psycho doctor that boosted her,
he took most of the files on her,

254
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,954
but they can probably
dig up a picture or two.

255
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,389
I burned the ones I had.

256
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,058
Psycho doctor?

257
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,989
Oh, Jesus Christ,

258
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:01,756
what is wrong with you?

259
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,628
What, are you a cop or something?
Why all the questions?

260
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,359
You guys going to sit around all day
asking stupid questions

261
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,367
or are you going to find her and help me?

262
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,538
Wait, wait a minute.

263
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,368
You want us to walk around
with a picture of your daughter

264
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,580
asking people where we could find her?

265
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,942
I mean, she could be in a basket
for all we know.

266
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,512
First of all,

267
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,551
I always leave that part up to you guys,

268
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,654
that's what you do.

269
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,823
Now like I said,

270
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,788
she isn't far from the hospital,

271
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,929
so just keep her away from here.

272
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,631
That's all we have to go on?

273
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,333
I mean, what is her name?

274
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,425
Her name's Lucille.

275
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,465
Just follow the trail of bodies.

276
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,005
Oh, no,

277
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,439
you'll see.

278
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,551
Welcome to now.

279
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,057
Hey, what can I get you?

280
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,228
We got a two drink minimum.

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,398
If there really is such a thing.

282
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,498
Sid no longer works for Daddy.

283
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,599
He tends bar at a gentleman's club.

284
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:12,565
I'll Just think about it.

285
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,737
No way.

286
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,897
Not a gentleman in sight.

287
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:21,144
They call it Toxic.
I've been called worse.

288
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,343
um, okay, uh,

289
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,512
double vodka.

290
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,775
Three limes.

291
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,453
How long you been working here?

292
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,781
uh, not long.

293
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,056
Do you want to keep it open, Gus?

294
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,796
um, yeah.

295
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,292
Yeah, keep it open.

296
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,145
Hey.

297
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,548
Hey.

298
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,882
What's your name?

299
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,089
Sid.

300
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,923
unbelievable.

301
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,195
Hey buddy, let's go.

302
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:18,835
Time to go.

303
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,231
You driving home?

304
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,530
I'm fine.

305
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,072
Yeah, well you go be fine somewhere else.
Let's move it.

306
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,003
I have to get my card.

307
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,074
Yeah, you can get that tomorrow.

308
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,438
Let's go, come on.

309
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,810
Have a good night.

310
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,380
Bye bye.

311
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,922
Hey, babe.

312
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:38,885
Hi.

313
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:39,886
Let me help you there.

314
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,057
Thanks.

315
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,419
Simon.

316
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,457
Sir?

317
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:44,753
I need you to drive Rizzo tonight.

318
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:46,923
Yeah, where to?

319
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,895
Sherman Oaks, she knows the address.

320
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,828
This better be quick, Steve,
I have class in the morning.

321
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,596
That all depends on you, doesn't it?

322
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,272
Come on, fuck wad.

323
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,478
How's everything working out?

324
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,113
Oh, it's great. I,
I can't thank you enough, Steve.

325
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,211
Steve found a transient.

326
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,219
He said, 'where we're going,
you can be anyone you want from now on.

327
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,223
What should I call you?
The transient replied, 'Sid.'

328
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,055
Yeah, well,
what can I say? I got a big heart.

329
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,089
And an even bigger cock.

330
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,733
Can you close up on your own tonight?

331
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,767
uh, yeah, absolutely.

332
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,402
Good,

333
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,100
good night.

334
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,171
Hey, Sid.

335
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,140
That was a great show you had tonight.

336
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,174
Thanks.

337
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,972
Apparently you're
the only one with that opinion.

338
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,547
No, that's cool, you can keep it.

339
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,753
Are you sure?

340
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,547
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

341
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,053
Alright, then,

342
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,452
how about a drink?

343
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,497
So, is it true?

344
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,957
You live in the attic?

345
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,799
um, well yeah, just for now.

346
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,503
Steve's sort of helping me out,
he's been a good guy.

347
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,035
Oh, yeah, Steve,
he's a real fucking saint.

348
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,275
Saint Steve.

349
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,979
Well, to Saint Steve.

350
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,977
Most people are haunted by their past.

351
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,582
Everyone else fears the future.

352
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,879
The only place to hide is in the present,

353
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,916
where no one's looking.

354
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,900
What?

355
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,169
Where?

356
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,276
I see her, shut up.

357
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,243
Shh, shh, shh.

358
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,027
It's gonna be okay.

359
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,163
I brought you something.

360
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,696
Something to keep you warm.

361
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,564
What's your name?

362
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,275
They call me Little Joe.

363
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,734
Little Joe.

364
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,173
Lucille.

365
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,957
You smell so good.

366
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,122
Your hair is so beautiful.

367
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,130
Oh, I've been waiting to
get you up here all night, Nadine.

368
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,496
Nadine, Nadine.

369
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:25,504
So fine, so young, and so clean.

370
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,789
Oh, goddamn.

371
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:48,395
Oh. God, you're so beautiful.

372
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,367
It's better then...

373
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:07,979
Oh, ah, baby that was amazing.

374
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,258
Here you go, baby.

375
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,935
You could leave if you want.

376
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,307
This is my room.

377
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,638
Oh,

378
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,505
okay.

379
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,375
Stay, then.

380
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,591
Just follow the trail of mice.

381
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:53,953
You'll see.

382
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,830
The sooner you guys get the fuck going,

383
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,162
the sooner you'll find her.

384
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,466
Ta-ta.

385
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,015
What the fuck was that?

386
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,215
That boy has lost it.

387
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,812
We need to find new fucking jobs.

388
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,655
Yeah, maybe I'll open a flower shop.

389
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,359
Let's go, Brokeback.

390
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,120
We got to find this Lucille bitch.

391
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,630
Bitch.

392
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,409
Hello?

393
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,454
Are you okay?

394
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,821
Are you okay?

395
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,798
What are you,

396
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,763
what are you doing here?

397
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,663
Did you sleep here last night?

398
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,868
Do you have anywhere to go?

399
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,870
God.

400
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,784
You are beautiful.

401
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,782
I think I can help you.

402
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,191
But I can introduce you to someone,

403
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,225
he can give you a place to stay.

404
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,864
All we have to do
is just clean you up a little bit.

405
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,098
Let's go introduce you to Angel,

406
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,035
he's going to love you. Come on.

407
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,491
Go on, take your shower right here,

408
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,923
I have some clothes for you on the dresser
so you'll be alright.

409
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,447
Come on, this is all you have?

410
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,081
One lousy fucking photo?

411
00:26:59,317 --> 00:26:59,976
You can't keep that,

412
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,015
you're not even supposed
to be looking at that.

413
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,722
Give me that.

414
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,118
Jesus Christ.

415
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,917
Yeah, thanks for nothing.

416
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,257
But it's only a matter of days.

417
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:22,721
For who?

418
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:23,826
Me or her?

419
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,158
Both of you.

420
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,000
Or maybe just one of you.

421
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,025
Hard to say.

422
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,732
What should I do?

423
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,974
Should I have her, you know...

424
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,772
You must find her first.

425
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,844
Okay, what do I do when I do find her?

426
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:44,738
Huh?

427
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,508
All I know is that, uh,

428
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,352
in a matter of days she'll be no more.

429
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,979
So I find her,

430
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,054
off her,

431
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,657
no more curses.

432
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,887
Really?

433
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,764
Maybe it means you'll find her,

434
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,627
off her,

435
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,228
and in the process fulfill the prophecy.

436
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,967
They're coming in contact to her now.

437
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,813
Seriously, Lena, you,

438
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,415
some of the things you say actually
do sound like you're full of shit.

439
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm asking a serious question,
what do I do when I do find her?

440
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,720
We don't know, we find her.

441
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,720
That simple.

442
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,096
Sid,

443
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,765
do you have any idea why
my office smells like a frat house?

444
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,628
Yeah, I spilled a beer last night.

445
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,099
What were you doing up there?

446
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,038
I couldn't sleep,
I was just watching some TV.

447
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,173
There's no cable.

448
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,536
I know, I...

449
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,172
Don't go up there after hours, alright?

450
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,314
I'm trusting you by letting you stay here.

451
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,710
You don't want to break my trust,
you understand?

452
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,748
Yes.

453
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,888
Now get in there and do whatever
you can to get rid of that smell, it stinks.

454
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,095
She is raunchy, she is racy,

455
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,669
and she goes by the name of,
please give it up for Raven.

456
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,780
Hey, Sid,

457
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,477
what do you think about?

458
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,647
Think about what?

459
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,349
When you're all alone at night,
you're in the shower,

460
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,060
where does your mind take you?

461
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,887
I don't have a shower, Gus.

462
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,791
Hey, sweetie, how you doing?

463
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,590
Hey, I'm doing great.

464
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,698
Listen, I'm a little busy right now, okay?
Thank you.

465
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,569
I think about a girl, too.

466
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,807
One that I knew not too long ago,

467
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,305
and that I lost.

468
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,447
What are you going to do about it?

469
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,751
Well,

470
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,414
I guess when the time's right,

471
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,590
I'll find her when she's ready to be found.

472
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,051
What's up, Doc?

473
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:10,761
Do I know you?

474
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,558
No.

475
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,189
Greg.

476
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,130
Gus.

477
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,664
Why do you call me Doc?

478
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,495
Too many Bugs Bunny cartoons
growing up, I guess.

479
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,398
Is that alright with you, Chief?

480
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,505
uh, why don't you give this guy a drink.

481
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:29,837
Put it on my tab.

482
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,211
You know what I dig about this place?

483
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,022
How fucking pathetic they all are.

484
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,155
Look at her,

485
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:44,418
she's up there teasing all those little
puppies around the stage.

486
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,229
All the while

487
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,132
she's pretending to be in control.

488
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,230
Pretending to have all the power,

489
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,561
you know?

490
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,967
She needs those sick-ass mamas' boys
more than they need her,

491
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:03,043
and deep down she knows it.

492
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,042
And if you look really close,

493
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,942
I mean past the bullshit,

494
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,813
you catch one of them off guard,
look them deep in the eye,

495
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,521
you'll see something.

496
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,448
You'll see misery.

497
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,394
You'll see their souls, man.

498
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,088
Their filthy,

499
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,424
decaying souls.

500
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,270
It's fucking beautiful, man.

501
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,864
Greg,

502
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,973
I don't know what happened to you
when you were just a little boy

503
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,405
and your mommy messed around
with your head,

504
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,437
but it ain't that stripper's fault, okay?

505
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,113
Don't talk about my mother, faggot.

506
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,485
Okay, I got to go to the washroom.

507
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,749
Are you okay?

508
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,648
Did you see that?

509
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:24,955
See what?

510
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,019
The light.

511
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,986
The light going on like that.

512
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,251
Yeah, you fruit loop,
you just turned it on.

513
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,826
Michelle, don't.

514
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,362
There is nobody in there.

515
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:40,900
Sit down?

516
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:41,833
Sure.

517
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,437
Something happened here.

518
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,114
Something awful.

519
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,783
What are you talking about?
What happened?

520
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,952
I don't know yet.

521
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,949
I think it involved a girl.

522
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,115
What girl?

523
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,225
Last night

524
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,092
I saw her,

525
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,465
I touched her.

526
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,170
Alright, you're really starting to scare me.
What the hell are you talking about?

527
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,034
Did you hurt someone, Sid?

528
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,745
No. I didn't hurt anybody.

529
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,873
But somebody did.

530
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,774
Okay,
are you sure this wasn't just a dream?

531
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,180
No.

532
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,184
It wasn't a dream.

533
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,315
Alright, I think maybe
you just need to get some sleep.

534
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,585
I'm going to go.

535
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:38,522
No, please,

536
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:39,524
Michelle, please,

537
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:40,559
don't go.

538
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,891
I really don't want to be alone right now.

539
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,362
You know when I have to go.

540
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,594
See you in the morning.

541
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,728
What's your specialty?

542
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:23,871
What you got going on, babe?
You don't know what I'm going to do.

543
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,098
I want to come in.

544
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,602
Let me in, I want to come in.

545
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:58,240
Let me in, I want to come in.

546
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,480
What do you want?

547
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,738
What the fuck is this?

548
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,177
Yo, we paid the fucking bitch.

549
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,583
Who the fuck you think you talkin'... Yeah?

550
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,120
Motherfucker,
you want some money? Huh?

551
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,723
You want some money?

552
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,339
No, no, don't put her on my couch.

553
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,312
She's just going to get blood
all over my couch. Oh, my god.

554
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,714
Just go get the medical kit, okay?

555
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,183
Oh, god.

556
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,388
You gonna be okay.

557
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,352
Where am I?

558
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,287
Don't worry about it, you're safe, alright?

559
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:27,757
They're coming for me, I got...

560
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,489
Who's coming?
What the fuck did you do, Angel?

561
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,236
I'm not gonna let nothing happen to you,
alright?

562
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,234
They're coming. They got...

563
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,599
I told you, you safe, alright?

564
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:41,073
Daddy. Oh, my god,
and you say I'm crazy? Jesus.

565
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,173
Who is Daddy?

566
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,776
He's Daddy.

567
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,448
What is his real name?

568
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,184
Jake Van Sant.

569
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,746
Who the fuck is Jake Van Sant?

570
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:53,847
Don't go there!

571
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,791
Angel.

572
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,756
I'm not going back, I'm not, I'm not.

573
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,864
Yeah, you know where to find
Jake Van Sant?

574
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,624
Shh.

575
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,599
I, I, I need to calm down, now.

576
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,999
Make a note of that. I need to calm down.

577
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,738
Why should I do that?

578
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,976
uh, just watch me.

579
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,339
Look.

580
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,209
At what?

581
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:22,043
This is her.

582
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,846
At the cards, or at... This is her.
Both.

583
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:25,713
This is the what?

584
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,548
Shh. Listen.

585
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,296
What do you want?

586
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,718
Do you believe in ghosts, Rosemary?

587
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,650
Honey, the only ghosts
I believe in are the Father,

588
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,758
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

589
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,554
Mmm, and that Patrick Swayze.

590
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,594
Can't even look at pottery
no more without getting all wet.

591
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:11,961
I'm serious.

592
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,799
Have you seen a ghost, child?

593
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,631
She's something. It's like a,

594
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,176
it's like a nightmare and it doesn't care
whether I'm awake or asleep.

595
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,002
Hmm.

596
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,770
I don't know, I must sound
like I'm completely crazy or something.

597
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,040
And here I thought
I was the freak of the street.

598
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,250
Honey, you want my advice?

599
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,549
You never let no dead bitch tell you
what to do.

600
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,346
Them's words to live by.

601
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,422
That bitch ain't got done everything
she wanted to get done before she kicked it,

602
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,787
then that's her problem, it's not yours.

603
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,528
Maybe she should have been watching
little less TV and done a little more living.

604
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,698
'Cause if you die tomorrow you
don't want to be one of them assholes

605
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,369
of the afterlife scaring some hard working,

606
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,664
decent people into doing some bullshit

607
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,501
that you should have been doing
before you kicked it.

608
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:56,007
Now I say fuck that post-mortem ho.

609
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,445
Now she got a problem with that,

610
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,211
you tell her to come haunt Rosemary
for a day.

611
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:04,387
She be going back to hell so fast her hand
basket will have a hard time keeping up.

612
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,555
Yeah, thanks.

613
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,324
Now don't mention it, honey.

614
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,488
So you sure you ain't up
for a little taste while we're here?

615
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,198
Get a room,
Rosemary make you feel real nice.

616
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:20,660
Got a lot of tricks in my tickle trunk.

617
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,770
Yeah, well, I don't know that.

618
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,174
I'll see.

619
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,870
I hope so.

620
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,357
What happened to you?

621
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,794
I had a very strange evening.

622
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,390
um, excuse the mess.

623
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,259
You live here?

624
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,801
Yeah, like it or not,
it's home for right now.

625
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,070
No, I like it, it's nice.

626
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,001
Thanks.

627
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,503
Come here, let me see your head.

628
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,735
Who did this to you?

629
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,881
Well, what? Some homeless person
attack you or something?

630
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,376
No, it was her.

631
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,780
The girl, Lucille.

632
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,786
Well the, the scratches were, anyways.

633
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,228
Come on, Sid, what is this?

634
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,532
Some kind of cry for help?
I want to help you, I do.

635
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,768
But fuck, what are you doing?

636
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,600
I don't know.

637
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,776
Look,
it's almost six o'clock in the morning.

638
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,611
Why don't you just stay here

639
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,618
and we'll try and figure
this all out tomorrow, okay? Deal?

640
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,686
I didn't ask for this.

641
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,123
I want it to go away more than
anything in the world.

642
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,327
But I don't know how to make it.

643
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,833
Look, I just have a hard time
believing all this.

644
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,167
I don't care if you don't believe me.

645
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:07,408
You're the only person I can trust.

646
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,242
Just, please,

647
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,849
please, please, just help me.

648
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:19,879
I think Steve might be involved and,

649
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,756
can we just, can we keep this a secret?

650
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,398
Okay, okay.

651
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,009
Hey, Sidney,
when's the last time you took a shower?

652
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,647
uh, a while.

653
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,941
Well we overslept big time,
so why don't you hope in with me,

654
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,244
it'll be faster.

655
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:52,614
uh, yeah, sure, okay.

656
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,845
Okay.

657
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,226
Oh, I'm sorry, go, get in.

658
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,269
Mmm, smell this.

659
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,537
Cucumber eucalyptus.

660
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,510
Did you ever use one of these?

661
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,372
um, no.

662
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:19,377
I can't say that I have.

663
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,607
Are you kidding me?
Turn around, turn around.

664
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,140
What's the problem?

665
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,975
I can't do this.

666
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:49,774
Why?

667
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,383
Because I have a daughter,
I have responsibility.

668
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,511
Come on, let's just clean your head, okay?

669
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,797
Are you sure nobody's going to notice?

670
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,263
Positive.

671
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,971
And why do you care?

672
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,737
I mean, it's better than having these welts
on your head.

673
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,375
Do you really want to explain it
to every asshole who orders a drink?

674
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,010
No, that's a good point.

675
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,144
How about some lipstick?

676
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,378
No way.

677
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,174
Huh uh, not on your life.

678
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,748
Oh, come on, just a little.

679
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,883
So, anybody need a ride tonight?

680
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,851
You know, anywhere?

681
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:37,526
Simon,

682
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,389
if we need something, Steve will tell you.

683
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,956
How much you guys get for that?

684
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,366
For what?

685
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,763
Well that shit
I'm always driving you to and from.

686
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,072
Why?

687
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,069
You looking to get in on the action?

688
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:53,807
Well, kind of, yeah.

689
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,074
uh, you know, what's Steve's take?

690
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,781
Like, I'd take, like, half of what he takes.

691
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,973
You just have to give me a, a freebie

692
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,710
like twice a week, each of you.

693
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,553
Oh, Riz, Simon wants to be
a discount pimp. Shh.

694
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,461
So?
Hey Steve-O,

695
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:13,889
Simon wants to be our pimp.

696
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,723
No, Steve, no.

697
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,831
Yeah, go ahead you fucking piece of shit.

698
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,625
You're late, both of you.

699
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,033
Sorry, Steve, late night.
Time to keep the customers waiting.

700
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,741
You, go get dressed and shut
that smart mouth of yours.

701
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,500
Not so fast, fuck head.

702
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,508
I had a visit from the police this morning.

703
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,373
Apparently some moron
ran out of here screaming,

704
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,015
left the fucking doors wide open.

705
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,980
Any idea who that would be?

706
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,187
Steve, I'm sorry.

707
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,445
Don't fucking sorry me, Sid.

708
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,520
I know you got problems and shit,
and I'm trying to help you out.

709
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:42,088
But we've all got problems.

710
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,260
Right now my biggest one is you.

711
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,025
This kind of business I'm running here,

712
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,925
I can't afford to have the cops
come in here checking on me,

713
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,258
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

714
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,661
I also can't afford to have
a fucking lunatic living here,

715
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,598
leaving the fucking doors wide open

716
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,136
so any one of these billion Mexican fucks
that this city's crawling

717
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,707
with can cha-cha their cajones in here
and bandito my shit.

718
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:01,740
You know what I'm saying?

719
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:02,877
Yeah.

720
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,907
You used your get out of shit free card.

721
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,276
Next time, just do your fucking job.

722
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:09,978
Now fuck off.

723
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,614
What are you doing here?

724
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,990
It's Friday.

725
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,456
Yeah, I know it's Friday,

726
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,220
but it's one o'clock in the afternoon.

727
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,160
Not the weekend.

728
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,799
It's a long weekend.

729
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,627
I had a half day today.

730
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,065
Monday and Tuesday off.

731
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,403
For what?

732
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,074
Parent-Teacher Conferences.

733
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,201
I assume you weren't planning
on attending.

734
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,969
I didn't know I was invited.

735
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:11,941
Where's Debbie?

736
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,474
In the car.

737
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,511
What do you want me to do? I'm working.

738
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,378
Is that what you call this?

739
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:22,853
Could you please just take her
to my mother's?

740
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,057
God forbid you're only daughter
should interfere

741
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,289
with this wonderful lifestyle of yours.

742
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,863
I'm really not in the mood for this.

743
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,465
In the mood for what?

744
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,028
Motherhood?

745
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,862
She hates your mother's house.

746
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,537
She's bored.

747
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:41,167
Although she still prefers it to
that roach nest you live in.

748
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,480
She begged me all the way here
not to make her go and stay with Mommy.

749
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,112
You're a fucking asshole.

750
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,748
Michelle, what are you doing here?

751
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,251
I'm doing the best I can.

752
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,972
I'm giving you a chance for a normal life.

753
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,805
I don't want any part of a life
that you're in.

754
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,243
Okay.

755
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,818
Then you'll get your wish.

756
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,820
My attorney's filing for full custody
first thing Monday morning.

757
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:28,983
What?

758
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,591
It's already in the works.

759
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,823
You can fight it if you want,

760
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,222
but you can't afford it,

761
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,596
and you won't win.

762
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,868
Think about it over the weekend.

763
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:45,873
Debbie will be at your mom's

764
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,937
if you feel like saying goodbye.

765
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,291
He's right.

766
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,599
What the fuck am I doing?

767
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,963
I don't deserve her.

768
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,275
Don't say that.

769
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,271
There's always a way out.

770
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,009
Always.

771
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,047
Enter.

772
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,460
What's up, baby doll?

773
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,863
Can we talk for a second?

774
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,923
Yeah, sure, what is it?

775
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:20,761
um,

776
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,463
look, I'm really sorry I was late today,

777
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,767
it's just that
I got a lot going on in my head and...

778
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,774
Spit it out, sweetheart.

779
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,680
I need money, badly.

780
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:41,054
And I was wondering
if maybe you could give me a loan.

781
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:44,385
And I'll pay it back
if it takes the rest of my life, I swear.

782
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,556
Interest or whatever. And,

783
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,999
Steve, you know I wouldn't come to you
unless it was life or death.

784
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,595
Well how much?

785
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,298
Five thousand.

786
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,599
Five...

787
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,342
what do you need that for?

788
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,909
So I can retain a lawyer,

789
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,145
so I don't lose my daughter.

790
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,881
And when do you need it by?

791
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:08,141
Monday.

792
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,751
Jesus Christ, Michelle, how you going
to pay that kind of money off?

793
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,387
It's not exactly
like you're working Vegas in here.

794
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,647
I know, but Steve, you know me.

795
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,288
You know I'd do whatever it takes.

796
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,520
I never thought
I'd be having this conversation with you,

797
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,264
or at least I hoped I wouldn't.

798
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,000
I can't just give you the money.

799
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,531
If I could, I would, but

800
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:30,170
it's just my pockets aren't
that deep these days.

801
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:37,612
There's really only one way
I can see you working this cash off.

802
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,854
Like I said, whatever it takes.

803
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,504
You okay, babe?

804
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,368
I've been better.

805
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,310
Open.

806
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,818
It's just a Valium,
it'll help you get through.

807
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:23,952
Thank you.

808
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,392
Hey, you're going to be okay.

809
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:26,416
You remembered.

810
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,085
Yeah, of course I remembered.

811
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:32,655
Good to see you.

812
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,332
You see me every day, Gus.

813
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,667
What more can a man ask for?

814
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,939
You want to ride with me?

815
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,843
You want to start the clock right now?

816
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,413
Fine, fucker.

817
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,111
No bullshit?

818
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,816
No, no bullshit.

819
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,757
Don't forget
to lock the fucking door tonight.

820
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:58,781
It's okay.

821
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,274
Debbie, is that you?

822
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,722
Are you looking for your mommy?

823
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,968
Thanks for nothing.

824
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,502
Hey, I can't find this broad, man.

825
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,976
This is fucking way
beyond ridiculous, man.

826
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,844
I have talked to everybody
in this fucking little town,

827
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:11,781
and all we have to
go on is this fucking picture,

828
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:16,390
and a name of a girl who does not even
seem to exist in any known database.

829
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,222
So the way I figure it,

830
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:22,431
we just chill for a few days, man,
tell Van Sant we couldn't find her.

831
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:24,496
Yeah,
but what if the curse does come true?

832
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,759
First of all, I cannot believe
you're buying into this curse bullshit.

833
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,199
And B, if the curse does come true,

834
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,204
then Van Sant will be dead,
and we'll be looking for a new job either way.

835
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,842
I say we give it a couple more days.

836
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,943
They seem to think
she'd be pretty easy to find.

837
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,078
Okay, A,

838
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,747
she's not somebody
he's going to be looking for,

839
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,848
because he's scared
of this curse bullshit of his.

840
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:42,551
And second,

841
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,514
has Van Sant ever found anyone before?

842
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,153
No. Well,
well look for the trail of dead bodies.

843
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,254
Do you see any?

844
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:49,958
You see any bodies laying around here?

845
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:51,953
Just him.

846
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:06,374
Hey, you seen this girl before?

847
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:08,535
Her name is Lucille.

848
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,938
Hello?

849
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,074
Nothing.

850
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,354
Fuck.

851
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,033
It's not her.

852
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,878
[unintelligible] an angel,
or it's fucking raining white people.

853
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,380
Alright, I say we go in there.

854
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,279
That's it for that dude.

855
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,159
Hey, excuse me, fellas,

856
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,390
has anybody seen this girl?

857
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,173
Oh,

858
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,934
whoa, hold on for a minute.

859
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,511
Yeah?

860
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,878
Yeah, I, I think we found our Lucille.

861
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,587
Don't think, okay? Know.

862
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:26,652
Yo, man.

863
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,326
I'm on the phone.

864
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,622
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

865
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,866
Hello?

866
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,072
Hmm.

867
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:47,941
Yo, was that Van Sant?

868
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,373
You know what?

869
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,603
I ain't answering, any questions

870
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:56,444
until this motherfucker apologizes
for making my phone into soup.

871
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,746
You know how long it took me to put
those numbers in that phone?

872
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,082
Huh? Do you?

873
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,951
This is a racist thing, isn't it?

874
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,352
Yo, how about you
just answer the questions

875
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,618
before I blow your fucking head off.

876
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:07,056
See, now I know it's a racist thing.

877
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,456
You don't like Mexicans.

878
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,032
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

879
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,330
We need this guy alive.

880
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:18,870
We need to find out where,

881
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,975
hey, let me give you
a lesson on interrogation, Antoine.

882
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,303
You point the gun to his head,

883
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:25,309
and then you ask the question.

884
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,548
Have you seen this girl?

885
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:30,808
Okay, now here's the tricky part.

886
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,521
Either he gives us the answer we want,

887
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,586
then if he doesn't,
you can blow his fucking head off.

888
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,256
Have you seen this girl?

889
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,428
Hey, man, I told you
I don't know where that girl at.

890
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,826
All I know, they told me that people
going to come around looking for a girl.

891
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,534
That's the honest truth.

892
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,331
wrong answer.

893
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,101
Where is she?

894
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,177
That's far enough.

895
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,510
Go, Stretch.
Come on.

896
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,087
It's all paid for, come on.

897
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,257
Heart treatment tough guy.

898
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,526
Shut the fuck up.

899
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,485
Simon!

900
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:44,886
Simon! Hey, hey!

901
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,823
You piece of shit.

902
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,361
Jesus Christ, you want to bully
these bitches up?

903
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,031
Get the fuck out of here.

904
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,699
Want me to fuck you up, bitch?

905
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,663
Bullshit.
Get this piece of shit out of here.

906
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,928
Cock sucking motherfucker.
Get lost.

907
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,064
Bye-bye.

908
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,775
Motherfucker.

909
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:05,571
What happened?

910
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,646
That fucking guy Greg.

911
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,041
Fuck,

912
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:10,383
shit.

913
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,915
God I promised myself I'd never do that.

914
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,556
What the fuck is wrong with me?

915
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,488
Come on, Calm down,
people do things that they regret.

916
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,756
Michelle.

917
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,671
I really don't think being happy
is in the cards for people like you and me.

918
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,637
I mean, are you really happy
in a place like this?

919
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:36,440
I'm happy when I'm with you.

920
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:43,678
You mean it?

921
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:45,849
Yes, I do.

922
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,825
I used to get deja vu when I was younger.

923
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,730
It's silly, but,

924
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,335
you know when it would happen?

925
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,268
When everything just goes numb

926
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:13,280
and time stands still,
and you know that you've seen that exact

927
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,084
image somewhere before.

928
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,817
I used to tell myself that
I was on the right track, you know?

929
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,488
I was exactly where
I was supposed to be in life.

930
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,363
You still get them?

931
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,661
No.

932
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,237
I don't remember exactly
when they stopped, but

933
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,041
probably when I gave up the notion

934
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,370
that we all have a purpose in life other
than to fuck and die.

935
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:47,239
What about you?

936
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,781
You believe in all that fatalist shit?

937
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,584
No.

938
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:56,216
I think we're pretty much free
to create the world we want to live in.

939
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,521
And I suppose the world you want to exist
in is in the attic of a titty bar?

940
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,790
Well, I who said your world
has to be a place?

941
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,302
Sometimes who can be more important
than where.

942
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:18,177
Sid, Sid, Sid, late night psychopath,
early morning philosopher.

943
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,615
You are some fucking enigma, baby.

944
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,976
Some fucking enigma.

945
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,217
Alright, I'm right away coming back.

946
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:35,923
No... You cannot leave me here with her,
okay?

947
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,598
I mean, why can't we just leave her here
by herself?

948
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,425
In fact, we should just let them have her.

949
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,770
For some reason
I don't come back and somebody else do,

950
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,372
then you aim the tip at their chest,
pull the trigger.

951
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,168
No... how am I going to know
that it's them and not you?

952
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,879
'Cause, I'm going to say this is Angel,

953
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,273
and they probably not going to do that.

954
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,779
We need like a special knock or something.

955
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:57,918
Alright, I'm going to knock five times,
that's how you gonna know it's me.

956
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,985
No, 'cause they may knock five times.

957
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,719
We need like, like a special knock
or something. You know,

958
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,518
like, like knock three times,

959
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,592
knock two times, and then knock once.

960
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,632
Alright, I got it.

961
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,200
I'll be back.

962
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,366
I love you.

963
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,653
Guess you didn't bring the girl, huh?

964
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,055
What you doing in there?

965
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,123
What?

966
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,557
You're not, uh,
you're not working for Steve yet, are you?

967
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,060
Yeah, of course I'm working for Steve.

968
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,164
So are you.

969
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:27,562
No, I mean, like afterwards.

970
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,201
Are you fucking kidding me?

971
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:35,738
No, uh, no,
I figure I start with one and then,

972
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,242
you know, then you'll see how much money

973
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,005
you're making 'cause my percentage
is so much less.

974
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,241
You know?

975
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,909
I figure somebody like you,

976
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,587
well we could make a lot of money,

977
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:48,790
you won't have to deal with
that piece of shit ever again.

978
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,013
What do you say?

979
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,658
What's so funny?

980
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,588
I knew it.

981
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:57,799
Knew what?

982
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,459
It's so obvious now.

983
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,704
No wonder you can't concentrate
on your job.

984
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,338
What are you talking about, Sid?

985
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:08,840
Well, you work at a titty bar because
you think it makes you more of a man.

986
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,940
That you work out
like you have something to prove.

987
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,876
You act like you're protecting these girls,

988
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:15,708
but when they need you most,

989
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:18,011
where the fuck are you, Simon?

990
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,482
Man, you're buried so deep in the closet,

991
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:21,552
man, you can't even breathe.

992
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,152
What the hell is going on in here?

993
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,885
I'm not a faggot, you little fucking bitch.

994
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,462
Fucker, I'm going to fucking kill you.
Hey... come here, you, get in the office.

995
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,199
Get in there.

996
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,301
Get back in the bar,
I'll deal with you later.

997
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:38,096
Now fuck off.

998
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:39,967
Hey, you...

999
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,573
Sid,

1000
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,145
pack up your belongings, you're fired.

1001
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,613
I'm sick of being a parent around here.

1002
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,012
That's why I never had kids,
you can't fire them.

1003
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,016
I'm sorry things didn't work out.

1004
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:56,421
I wish you the best,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

1005
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,149
Goodbye, goodnight.

1006
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:06,962
What the hell was that about?

1007
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:09,066
I'm letting your little friend go.

1008
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,237
You can't do that.

1009
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:12,531
Yes I can, and I feel better already.

1010
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:14,908
If Sid goes, I go.

1011
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,133
Right.

1012
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,540
Sid doesn't have anyone else.

1013
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:22,307
Well then Sid can stay with you,
it's not my problem.

1014
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:31,955
One more chance?

1015
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,458
What the fuck? Get the fuck out of here.

1016
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,127
I know a doctor, a shrink.

1017
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,862
I used to send all the girls there
when their emotional problems

1018
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,593
got in the way of their work.

1019
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:44,396
His name's Doctor Zilver.

1020
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,471
He's in Van Nuys, takes cash, I trust him.

1021
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:47,471
Take Sid there,

1022
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,144
but one more chance.

1023
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,846
You getting soft in your old age, Steve?

1024
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,548
Well maybe you
just don't do it for me anymore.

1025
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,118
Right.

1026
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:15,262
Oh, my future.

1027
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,366
What, what about my future?

1028
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,074
Your future, let's see.

1029
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,874
I can't see it now.

1030
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,049
What do you mean?

1031
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,917
You can't, you don't see a future?

1032
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:32,950
No future?

1033
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,815
Time and patience.

1034
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:36,490
Oh, Jesus.

1035
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,591
Go away,

1036
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:44,226
I'm busy. I'm with the president.

1037
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,894
Hey, who the fuck are you guys?

1038
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,504
Get the fuck out of here.

1039
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,105
Get... I see it now.

1040
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,358
Toxic.

1041
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:13,754
Sid, it's Michelle.

1042
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:15,163
Hey.

1043
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:16,929
Listen to me, you were right.

1044
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,294
I spoke with my lawyer,
and he did a little digging.

1045
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,800
Apparently there
was a Lucille reported missing

1046
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:25,666
from a psychiatric hospital
in San Bernardino.

1047
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,239
We have to go there.

1048
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,440
I'm on my way out there right now.

1049
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:33,444
Just act normal, I'll be in on time.

1050
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,782
I love you, Michelle.

1051
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,981
Sid, you're cutting out.

1052
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:42,315
I'll, I'll call you back on my way home.

1053
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,256
We all must pay for our sins.

1054
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,165
Dr. Gowman, your six o'clock is here.

1055
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,662
Send her in.

1056
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:32,001
Hi.

1057
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,766
Hi, I'm Dr. Gowman, how can I help you?

1058
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,776
um, my name is Michelle Pagero and

1059
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:41,438
I was looking for a friend of mine,
and I was told I could find her here.

1060
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:42,615
What is her name?

1061
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:44,783
Her name's Lucille.

1062
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,921
What is this about?

1063
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,784
It's just really important that I see her.

1064
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,221
I'm sorry.

1065
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,255
I'm afraid that's quite impossible.

1066
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,521
Well what about her doctor?
Are you her doctor?

1067
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:59,733
No, Dr. Adderly is no longer with us.

1068
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:03,301
What exactly is your relationship
with Lucille?

1069
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,933
um, we went to high school together.

1070
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,175
Lucille never went to high school.

1071
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:12,146
Maybe it was elementary school,
who can remember?

1072
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:16,875
um, when did he resign?
Was it before or after she escaped?

1073
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:21,146
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work I need to attend to.

1074
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:26,422
Security, would you please have
Miss Pagero escorted off the premises.

1075
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:38,773
Do me a favor,

1076
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:41,808
send a couple of pussy shots over
to the Chicano and the redneck.

1077
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,140
You know, Michelle really likes you.

1078
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,042
She's the only reason you're still here.

1079
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,245
Yeah, I know.

1080
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,818
Maybe she's, uh,

1081
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:56,151
maybe she's right,
maybe I am a little hard on you.

1082
01:14:56,725 --> 01:15:00,058
That's fine.
Are we cool?

1083
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:02,953
Yeah, we're cool.

1084
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:08,527
Toxic.

1085
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,738
Sid, it's me. I'm on my way back.

1086
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:11,735
What happened?

1087
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,397
I couldn't get much out of them,

1088
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,041
but Lucille did escape.

1089
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,141
She was there.

1090
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,142
How the hell she made it here,
I don't know.

1091
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,172
Maybe we should talk to Steve.

1092
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,747
Don't come in today.

1093
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:24,043
What?

1094
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,019
Do you hear me, Michelle?

1095
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,847
Do not come in today.

1096
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,887
I don't care what you do,
but do not come make it in the club today.

1097
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,150
Do you understand?

1098
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:34,419
But why? What are you going to do? Sid!

1099
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,051
I think someone's coming.

1100
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,560
No, no, for real this time.

1101
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,233
You're supposed to knock,
then I say 'enter.'

1102
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,530
That's the order.

1103
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,069
I want to talk about Lucille.

1104
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:29,801
It's about time.

1105
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:31,312
What about her?

1106
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,740
You killed her.

1107
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,042
She came to you for help,
and you killed her.

1108
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,584
No...

1109
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,892
Every girl that comes through
that door is given an option.

1110
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:50,124
I don't take it away.

1111
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,569
You killed Lucille, Sid.

1112
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:55,768
You.

1113
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,771
Are you Lucille?

1114
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:04,535
Are you Lucille?

1115
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:10,251
No.

1116
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,850
You killed, you killed Lucille, Sid.

1117
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,148
You, you. Not me.

1118
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,120
We must all pay for our sins,
Steve Merchant.

1119
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,624
Are you fucking kidding me
you crazy little cunt?

1120
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,329
You must suffer for what you've done?

1121
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:23,326
You first.

1122
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:25,256
How's that?

1123
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,832
And what have I done?

1124
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,799
What the fuck have I done, huh?

1125
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,502
You steal innocence.

1126
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:34,199
You trade it for money.

1127
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,875
That's all they want,

1128
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,012
is to be happy.

1129
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,516
Is that too much to fucking ask?

1130
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,075
Fuck off.

1131
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,561
All I ever did was try to help you.

1132
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,633
Steve,

1133
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:41,871
oh.

1134
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,337
Michelle, Michelle.

1135
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,741
What do you want?

1136
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:49,476
We got to go tonight.

1137
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,015
Look, I'm not,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1138
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:55,118
No, look,
everything's going to be different now.

1139
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:57,450
Look.

1140
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:01,894
Why do you have that
and why are you driving Steve's car?

1141
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,998
What the fuck did you do?

1142
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,493
We're free now.

1143
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,694
Okay, we have to call the cops.

1144
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,774
No, no.

1145
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:14,133
Don't you see?

1146
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,601
This is how we get our innocence back.

1147
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,340
We can be happy.

1148
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:20,404
Isn't that what you wanted?

1149
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,911
Are you fucking crazy?

1150
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,549
You think you're a man,
but you're not a man.

1151
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:24,979
Look, I know.

1152
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,653
You found her.

1153
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,924
Fucking get off of me.

1154
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,979
You're the doctor who was looking for her?

1155
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:55,439
And I found her.

1156
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,541
But Steve didn't kill her.

1157
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,089
Guess that's what she wants.

1158
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:05,382
You tell me what she wants,
please help me.

1159
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:06,889
I'll help you,

1160
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:09,492
but there's something
we need to talk about.

1161
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,024
You're right,

1162
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:13,760
there is.

1163
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,961
What did you do to her?

1164
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,467
All I did was love her.

1165
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,179
Then why is she dead?

1166
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,606
Well she's dead because
she couldn't live with what she'd done.

1167
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,781
What are you talking about?

1168
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:35,790
What are you talking about?

1169
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,788
Now, you got to put down that gun.

1170
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:45,223
I don't trust you.

1171
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,662
There was a time
when you did trust me, Sid.

1172
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,564
Okay? And it wasn't that long ago.

1173
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:51,203
And you have to go back there.

1174
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,202
And you have to remember that time.

1175
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,876
Listen, I know what you're looking for,

1176
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,843
and I have the answer.

1177
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,813
But you have to give me that gun.

1178
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,618
Can you do it?

1179
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,280
Give me the gun.

1180
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:16,631
Good.

1181
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,292
Good.

1182
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,143
Do you love her?

1183
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,587
I love her very much.

1184
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,687
Okay.

1185
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:46,618
I'm sorry.

1186
01:22:53,368 --> 01:22:54,198
No,

1187
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:55,266
no!

1188
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:59,370
Stop, stop. Sid.

1189
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:03,534
She's gone.

1190
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,336
She's pretending to be in control.

1191
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,172
Good girl.

1192
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:08,939
Who says your world has to be a place?

1193
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,843
I've got a big heart.

1194
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,882
Sometimes you need something traumatic.

1195
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,178
You get to get those synapses really fired.

1196
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:15,616
Man, you're buried so deep in the closet?

1197
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,085
Now how about a little lipstick?

1198
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,419
Look, look, why don't you say it.

1199
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,823
God damn it look in the mirror,
what do you see?

1200
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:23,393
I see Sid.

1201
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:24,825
Bullshit.

1202
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,134
What's your name?

1203
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:27,801
Sid.

1204
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:28,627
He is dead.

1205
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,337
Look, what do you see?

1206
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:31,664
What's your name?

1207
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:32,395
Sid.

1208
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,107
What do you see?

1209
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:37,636
What the fuck do you see
fucking right there?

1210
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,244
What do you see?

1211
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,283
She's pretending to be in control.

1212
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:48,147
What do you see?

1213
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,186
...and an even bigger cock.

1214
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:51,790
Sometimes who can be more important
than where.

1215
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:55,487
It's okay.

1216
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,203
I lied.

1217
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,868
The burden was still too much to bear,

1218
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:09,599
so when the time was right
you simply became him.

1219
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,270
You were living with
two very distinct identities all along.

1220
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,745
All you did was kill the one
that brought you pain.

1221
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:17,751
You traded places,

1222
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,385
but a strong will can't
be killed off that easily.

1223
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,884
It was that strength
that made me fall in love with you.

1224
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:26,287
And things are going to be different now.

1225
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,488
Are they?

1226
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,668
I Don't like being me, Dr. Adderly.

1227
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,762
I'm afraid I can't.

1228
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,266
Well don't be afraid, just remember,

1229
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,373
love can conquer all.

1230
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:49,244
Not a very clinical thing to say, Doc.

1231
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:54,184
No, that's not me anymore,
that's all in the past.

1232
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,147
Past, present, future.

1233
01:24:58,593 --> 01:24:59,992
It's all in your head.

1234
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:03,824
It's not the same, it's not,

1235
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:06,095
it's not real, it's not,

1236
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:07,824
it's not real.

1237
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:09,734
We're real.

1238
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,832
No.

1239
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:19,241
It's going to be just as easy
to disappear into somebody else.

1240
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:23,639
Pull over.

1241
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,176
We're making good time.

1242
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,552
I want you to show me.

1243
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:34,761
I want to watch you disappear into me.

1244
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,224
Okay.

1245
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,141
Holy shit,

1246
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,011
I don't fucking believe it.

1247
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,487
Sid?

1248
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:07,721
Is that you?

1249
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,082
Remember me, Greg?

1250
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:13,485
What the hell you doing
all the way the fuck out here?

1251
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:15,922
You remember me, right?

1252
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:17,062
