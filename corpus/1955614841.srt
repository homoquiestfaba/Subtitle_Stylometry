00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,233
look who's here, boys.

3
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,967
F. Lee Bailey.

4
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,167
Hey, shyster! Welcome to hell!

5
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,767
What happened?

6
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,433
Your lawyer screw you?

7
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,533
Not even Jesus can save youse lawyers.

8
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,600
Lock down number 7.

9
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,233
Nothing makes people happier

10
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,267
than a lawyer going to prison.

11
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,567
And who could blame them?

12
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,167
Lawyers represent the victory

13
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,100
of reason over righteousness.

14
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:40,200
It's very easy
to lose faith in the system

15
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:43,367
where the strong tread on the weak.

16
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Trust me. I know.

17
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:49,067
It started on fat Tuesday.

18
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,167
Show your tits!

19
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,167
Show your tits!

20
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,267
Show your tits!

21
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
Show your tits! Show your tits!

22
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,233
I was having a bad night.

23
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,233
I'd just been introduced
to my conscience.

24
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:38,300
First impression, I can't say
that I liked him very well.

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,933
The bastard wouldn't go away.

26
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,967
I was trained in the law.

27
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,167
One of the first things they teach you

28
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,267
is that morality is
a private and costly luxury.

29
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,000
My father used to say

30
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,300
that jurisprudence wasn't equivocal

31
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,367
as long as you kept in mind

32
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,500
that truth is the highest law.

33
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,567
Judge banning, please.

34
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,033
Lawson Russell.

35
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,133
Tell him it's urgent.

36
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,967
This better be good, Lawson.

37
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,967
I'm less than a dance away
from getting my dick sucked.

38
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,267
Sir, I have a problem.

39
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,100
I'm going to recuse myself from the case.

40
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,267
Are you drunk?

41
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,467
Cold sober.

42
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,167
Have you informed your client?

43
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,167
Yes.

44
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,767
And his reaction was...

45
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,967
He was unhappy.

46
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,967
I should think he would be.

47
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Do you know how this
will look to the jury?

48
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,700
You've got the case won,
for Christ's sake!

49
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,167
You're out of your fucking mind!

50
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,967
Do you know that?

51
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,900
This is a monumental mistake
you're making here, son!

52
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:45,367
I cannot successfully
serve the needs of my client

53
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,433
at this time.

54
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,567
It is my duty...

55
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,967
To withdraw.

56
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,967
I'll have the paperwork on your desk

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,967
at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

58
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,967
And I'll be in at 10:00 to rip it up.

59
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,667
I'll see you in my chambers then.

60
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,267
Judge?

61
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,867
Son of a bitch!

62
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,167
Your lawyer is losing it, thurman.

63
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,967
Why didn't you call me?

64
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,167
It was a monumental mistake,

65
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,167
professional suicide.

66
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,933
My client was thurman parks III.

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,033
I grew up with thurman.

68
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,433
His daddy was a former
mayor of New Orleans

69
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:28,067
and one nasty son of a can of human cur.

70
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,200
But thurman was even meaner.

71
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,167
He was on trial for
the brutal rape and murder

72
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,567
of a lap dancer from Lafayette.

73
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,367
She died of asphyxiation,

74
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,333
her panties stuffed down her throat.

75
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,567
I love juries. They're all the same.

76
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,833
They think they've come
to judge guilt and innocence.

77
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,067
In the end,

78
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,433
they vote for whichever side
has the better lawyer.

79
00:08:57,467 --> 00:09:00,233
So I hammered them.

80
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:04,000
I made them look at that photo
until it was meaningless.

81
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,067
It was working.

82
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,033
Dang.

83
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,033
You are good, boy.

84
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,567
Have you looked over the questions

85
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,567
I'm going to ask you tomorrow?

86
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,267
I have them memorized.

87
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,967
We're going to win, aren't we?

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,967
You bet your ass we are.

89
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,000
I told that bitch I would walk.

90
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,233
That reporter.

91
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,133
You know the one.

92
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,500
Yeah.

93
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
I know the one.

94
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,567
I guess I always knew thurman was guilty,

95
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,500
but we trained ourselves
not to think about that.

96
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,033
We're supposed to be impartial,
unaffected, passionless.

97
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't know it at the time,

98
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,067
but that sudden act of
conscience had saved my life.

99
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,567
A penalty, violation of...

100
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,833
You're questioning my ethics?

101
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:45,167
Anything unethical... it's
your whole argument.

102
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,900
Now shut the fuck up,

103
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,267
the both of you!

104
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,500
Wiley, he obviously knows
that this bastard is guilty.

105
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,433
Now I wanna know if there's
been suppression of evidence.

106
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,176
You know, you may have
been a great quarterback,

107
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,100
Billy ray, and very popular
with all the girls,

108
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,667
but let me give you
a little piece of advice:

109
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,833
You do not wanna cross
swords with me, do you?

110
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,833
No, judge.

111
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,300
Leave us.

112
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,967
Don't get religion on me now, Lawson.

113
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We're too far down the road.

114
00:11:20,033 --> 00:11:24,100
Now you fuck this up
between thurman Jr. and me,

115
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,700
you won't have a future in this state.

116
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,300
Now, I'll fix it

117
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,767
so that you never practice the law again.

118
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,467
And you know I can do that, don't you?

119
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,900
Now you get back in there
and you finish this case.

120
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,567
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

121
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,767
This court is now in session.

122
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
All rise

123
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,033
for the honorable wiley banning.

124
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:02,367
I had represented a lot of rotten people

125
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,467
in my career, gotten them off,

126
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,467
and never given it a second thought.

127
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,833
Innocent until proven guilty.

128
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,833
And if you have enough money,

129
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,933
proof is mighty hard to come by.

130
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,067
Mr. Russell, are you ready to continue?

131
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,100
You have to be rich
to get away with murder.

132
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:22,600
And thurman was.

133
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,600
Filthy rich.

134
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,033
Mr. Russell.

135
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,933
Are you ready to continue?

136
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,967
I'd like to say
I answered to that... Higher law.

137
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,067
The truth of the matter is...

138
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
He never should have smiled.

139
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,033
Mr. Russell!

140
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,433
Are you ready?

141
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,967
Yes, sir.

142
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,333
I am.

143
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,100
The defense calls thurman parks III.

144
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,567
You swear to tell the truth,

145
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,267
the whole truth, nothing but the truth?

146
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
I do.

147
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:14,100
Thurman, tell the court where you were

148
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,833
on the night of June 17th.

149
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,200
I was in the silver garter dance club.

150
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:23,567
Where you met and had
drinks with jeanie brussard.

151
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,767
A drink.

152
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,833
A drink.

153
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What did you talk about?

154
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:36,467
No, this isn't one of
the questions that we prepared.

155
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,667
Tell the jury what you talked about.

156
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:47,333
Tell the jury what you talked about.

157
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,567
We... talked about...

158
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,067
Football.

159
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,867
Football.

160
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,967
Was that before or after

161
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,167
she danced naked on your lap?

162
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,567
Mr. Russell, approach the bench.

163
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,167
Was that before or after

164
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,167
you drove her down to the batcher

165
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,567
and dragged her up onto the Levy?

166
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
That's enough, Mr. Russell.

167
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,367
You are out of order!

168
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,200
Is that before or after

169
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,233
you stripped her, sodomized her,

170
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,800
strangled her...

171
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,033
You are in contempt, sir. Bailiff!

172
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:29,833
Bailiff! Remove Mr. Russell
from this courtroom!

173
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,767
Must have been a one-sided conversation

174
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,200
what with her panties
being stuffed down her throat.

175
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,400
Remove him from this courtroom!

176
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,833
Escort him out of my courtroom

177
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:43,433
and detain him for custody!

178
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,633
The jury will disregard

179
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,347
the outrageous outburst
of defense counsel.

180
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,767
It was declared a mistrial,

181
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,967
and I was fired by thurman parks III.

182
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,500
I never could stand him anyway.

183
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,767
The bad news was the disbarment hearing.

184
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,833
They threw the book at me.

185
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,767
Felt like the guy
who went into the hospital

186
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,500
to have his leg amputated

187
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,567
and had the good leg cut off by mistake.

188
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,467
And, of course, they had
to cut off the bad leg.

189
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,000
The court ruled in favor of the doctor.

190
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,967
Seemed I didn't have a leg to stand on.

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,767
It is the judgment of
the Louisiana supreme court

192
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,767
that as of this date,

193
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Lawson Russell, esquire,

194
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:59,533
be disbarred from
the practice of law for life.

195
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,967
I made a mistake.

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,100
Should have hired
one of those good old boys

197
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:12,967
down at the country club.

198
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,500
None of them would represent you.

199
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,800
Right.

200
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,767
Lawson, do you know what the odds are

201
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
that a woman will be raped

202
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:22,600
or molested in this country?

203
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,700
1 in 12.

204
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,967
How 'bout a man who kills a woman

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,133
actually appearing in a courtroom?

206
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,533
1 in 3.

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,967
I should be proud of myself.

208
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,567
Is that what you're saying?

209
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:41,200
He's gonna be retried, pope.

210
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,867
And he's not gonna be convicted.

211
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,367
Yep. I wrecked my career for nothing.

212
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
No, not for nothing.

213
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:51,467
You stood up for a basic moral principle:

214
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,567
To protect the innocent
and punish the guilty.

215
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,767
Your daddy would have been proud.

216
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,867
Of what? I broke the law.

217
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,767
Disregarded my sworn duty.

218
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
Ruined my life.

219
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,967
Your life's not over.

220
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,467
They took your license, not your balls.

221
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,867
There's so many things you can do.

222
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:16,000
I hear they're hiring at the winn-Dixie!

223
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,000
No, come on. Listen. I'm serious.

224
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:19,100
I'm serious!

225
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,967
So what are your plans?

226
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,067
Are you gonna sit up in here and stew?

227
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,467
I'm gonna go down to key west.

228
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
My father kept a house there.

229
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,267
Hell, I might even write a novel.

230
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,033
I'm as smart as John Grisham.

231
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,167
Lawson...

232
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,533
Is there anything I can do?

233
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,300
You can hop up on the desk for me.

234
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,967
What are you laughing at?

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,567
You know, if only you asked nicely.

236
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,233
I don't know what you want me to say,

237
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,800
but I'm the best.

238
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,867
Pride goeth before destruction

239
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,867
and a haughty spirit before a fall.

240
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,433
Too late.

241
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm already falling.

242
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
That's what's so sad.

243
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:14,467
You haven't fallen at all.

244
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,967
Been in the Florida keys
for almost 13 months.

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
Was nickel and diming as a fishing guide,

246
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:52,067
mostly to take up the time
and avoid writing my book.

247
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,467
But business was slow.

248
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,567
Mr. Russell.

249
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,133
Hello.

250
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,967
Hello.

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,367
My name is marlowe.

252
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,200
I spoke to you on the telephone earlier.

253
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,767
That's right. That's right.

254
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,633
Hello, Mr. marlowe.

255
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,900
Hello.

256
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,633
So you're interested in fishin'?

257
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,533
That's why I'm here.

258
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,833
Great. Come on aboard!

259
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,767
Mr. marlowe...

260
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,067
This must be the place.

261
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,200
Yes.

262
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,000
It's quite lovely.

263
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:17,233
How long we got ya
in key west there, sir?

264
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,633
Permanently.

265
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,067
I've just moved here.

266
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,033
I only recently retired from teaching.

267
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,967
See, my wife passed on.

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,967
We don't have any children,

269
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,067
and this place has always held my fancy.

270
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,033
The old man and the sea and all that.

271
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,633
Well, here's your pole, sir.

272
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,667
All right.

273
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,767
Low down like that. We're gonna float

274
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,367
on the tide right into those flats.

275
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,367
So you can just cast out this way

276
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,433
and let the boat just drift right on in.

277
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,600
All right.

278
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ho ho!

279
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:54,867
You're up a little bit there.

280
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,800
I feel like a professional.

281
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:05,567
There was something
very odd about Mr. marlowe.

282
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,767
I couldn't put my finger on it.

283
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,600
Had no idea it was fate come calling.

284
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,167
Chuckie.

285
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,167
Hearty dark, sir.

286
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,033
You got it.

287
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:22,033
And a daiquiri for me, please.

288
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,600
Anybody's favorite.

289
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,567
My father used to carry a pocket watch.

290
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,967
Very distinguished.

291
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,467
I... actually, this is quite a special one.

292
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,967
Listen.

293
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,567
Well, that's great.

294
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,700
Yes.

295
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,000
Here you go, gentlemen.

296
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,200
God bless you. Nice.

297
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,567
Well, here's to new friendships.

298
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,567
Cheers.

299
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,633
Cheers.

300
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,967
Well, sir, tell me.

301
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,100
Have you always been a fishing guide,

302
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,100
Mr. Russell?

303
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,067
No. It's kind of a hobby.

304
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,767
I'm working on a novel.

305
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,967
Really?

306
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,967
Yes, sir.

307
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,300
That's wonderful.

308
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,300
Before that, I was an attorney.

309
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,967
My.

310
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,133
And you've given that up?

311
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,233
So to speak.

312
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,367
Do you realize that there are more people

313
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,967
in law school right now
than there are lawyers?

314
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,367
Is that right?

315
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,300
It's a fact. For every engineer

316
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,033
they graduate from university,

317
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:23,833
they graduate 50 lawyers.

318
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:28,267
$25 billion in liability suits last year.

319
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,967
That's preposterous.

320
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:32,967
They're parasites.

321
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,800
They're bloodsuckers. That's my opinion.

322
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,200
Gee, Chris, I get the feeling
you don't like lawyers.

323
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,100
If it weren't for lawyers, dear boy,

324
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,000
we wouldn't need lawyers.

325
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,567
We drank and talked
for the rest of the evening.

326
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,367
Mr. marlowe was a hoot.

327
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,567
It was the most interesting
night I'd spent

328
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,567
with my clothes on in over a year.

329
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,567
Good night, Chris.

330
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,833
Yes, good night.

331
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:02,433
In the end, though, I was happy
to get away from him.

332
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:04,433
He was so rabid about lawyers,

333
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,600
he left me with a queasiness in my gut

334
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:08,967
like a feeling of déjà vu

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
or mild food poisoning.

336
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,500
Forget it. I'm not selling the townhouse.

337
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,633
My father bought that house.

338
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,633
Sell the rest of the stock.

339
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,233
Book's coming along fine, Harry.

340
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:30,000
My next question is,
how much am I paying you?

341
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,733
The stock. Right.

342
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,967
There's an old saying...

343
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,967
Money talks.

344
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,733
The only thing I ever
heard it say was good-bye.

345
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,833
I had to try to generate some income.

346
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:48,133
Been working on this
damn book for over a year.

347
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,300
Writing, my friends, is hard.

348
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:07,633
Chris.

349
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,967
Lawson. I hope I'm not intruding.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,367
No. Please, come in.

351
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,367
Thank you. Please.

352
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
I simply had to come by to talk with you.

353
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:19,600
You mind if I sit down for a moment?

354
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:20,967
No, of course.

355
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,667
Thank you. Have a seat.

356
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,567
You OK?

357
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,167
Yes, I'm fine.

358
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,567
It's just the heat.

359
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,033
Could I have a glass
of water or something?

360
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,567
Sure, sure. Thank you, sir.

361
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:41,567
Our conversation yesterday
was quite inspiring.

362
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,367
I simply had to come by,

363
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,600
talk with you.

364
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,367
Thank you.

365
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,367
Brought you something.

366
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,567
Right there.

367
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,300
That's better.

368
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
That's a novel. My first.

369
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,967
A novel? Yes.

370
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,667
I only recently finished it.

371
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,967
I'm such a coward,

372
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,633
I haven't told a soul
that I've written it.

373
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,000
I was wondering if you could read it

374
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,467
and give me your impressions.

375
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, I'm no expert.

376
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:17,967
No. I...

377
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,967
I think you'll understand this.

378
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,367
It's about lawyers.

379
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
I'll read it.

380
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,967
All right. Thank you.

381
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,967
Now, I want your honest opinion.

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You'll get it.

383
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:31,000
Good. All right, then.

384
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,167
Thank you, sir.

385
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,267
You can rest a bit. You don't have to...

386
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,800
No, I'm fine.

387
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,000
But I tell you,

388
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:43,967
I'll be at the pub later
if you're so inclined.

389
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,967
And, take your time with this.

390
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,800
There's no rush.

391
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,033
I want you to, digest it all.

392
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:51,800
OK.

393
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,567
Thank you, sir.

394
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,867
Let me get the door for you.

395
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,233
You are kind.

396
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:58,233
All right.

397
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,267
Thank you.

398
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:03,600
Happy reading, my friend.

399
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:32,867
A murder of crows.

400
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,167
Inside the title page

401
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,567
was a quote from William Shakespeare:

402
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,767
"The first thing we do
is kill all the lawyers."

403
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,967
The book was about lawyers,
all right... 5 of them,

404
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,067
all highly paid defense attorneys

405
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,633
working in major Southern cities,

406
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,367
all with very rich clients

407
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,033
who were guilty...

408
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:57,900
Very nasty bad guys
who deserved to be put away.

409
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,167
All acquitted.

410
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,567
But instead of going after the bad guys,

411
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,967
the killer decides

412
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,367
that it's the lawyers
who need to be punished,

413
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,900
so he knocks 'em off one by one.

414
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,500
Each murder was elaborately
planned and perfectly executed

415
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,400
to appear as a suicide,
accident, or botched robbery.

416
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,967
The writing was a revelation,

417
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
a masterpiece of suspense.

418
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,967
And that title...

419
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,967
I learned that a group of crows
is called a murder,

420
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,567
like a flock of seagulls,
an exaltation of doves,

421
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,500
or a covey of quail.

422
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,300
A murder of crows.

423
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,567
Quite simply, the book was brilliant.

424
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,900
Shit!

425
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:42,033
Chuckie!

426
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,967
Hey, Lawson.

427
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,967
Hey. Remember that old guy

428
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,967
I was drinking with last night?

429
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,367
Yeah. Have you seen him?

430
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,967
Yeah. He was in here earlier.

431
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,167
Said he wasn't feeling
well, then he split.

432
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,067
OK. Thank you.

433
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,567
Excuse me.

434
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,967
Roger that.

435
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,567
Excuse me. Yes. Is everything OK?

436
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,400
You a border here?

437
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:12,433
No. I'm just visiting a friend.

438
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,600
What happened?

439
00:28:13,633 --> 00:28:16,033
Well, it appears an old man
had a heart attack.

440
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:17,567
It wasn't Mr. marlowe, was it?

441
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,967
"Mr. marlowe." Yes, it was.

442
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,100
Is he OK?

443
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,833
I'm afraid not. He's... he's died.

444
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,300
I just... i just talked
to him this afternoon.

445
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:31,200
Yeah, I know. It's a shame, isn't it?

446
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:33,367
You know him a long time?

447
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,367
No. I just met him yesterday.

448
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,033
I took him fishing.

449
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,100
I understand he was new in town.

450
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,033
Yeah. That's what he said.

451
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,967
I mean... I don't know much.

452
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,433
He used to be a teacher,
and he moved here.

453
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:48,267
He retired here.

454
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,633
You know where he retired from?

455
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,967
No. He didn't say.

456
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,167
Well, the landlady said that he told her

457
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,767
he didn't have any family.

458
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,633
That's right. Right, right, yes.

459
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,600
His wife passed away recently.

460
00:29:00,633 --> 00:29:03,267
See, I've seen that
happen a million times.

461
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,367
First one spouse goes,

462
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,567
then the other one doesn't last a year.

463
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,367
Are there gonna be any services?

464
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,267
No. They'll probably
cremate him in the morning.

465
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,567
You could light a candle at St. Andrews.

466
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,967
OK. Thank you.

467
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,567
Yeah.

468
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,567
Excuse me.

469
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Excuse me, detective?

470
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,967
Detective...

471
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,067
Goethe.

472
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,567
What are they gonna do with his things?

473
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,833
Well, he's got no will,
and since he has no next of kin,

474
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:37,100
his possessions will go to the state.

475
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:41,100
Why? Is there something
we should know about?

476
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,667
Nope. Nope. Just wondering.

477
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,100
OK.

478
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,300
Night.

479
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,100
Good night.

480
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,567
I submitted the manuscript to 5 houses.

481
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,967
The first to call back
was devrie publishing.

482
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,800
I had an appointment with
the owner of the company.

483
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,167
Janine devrie.

484
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,867
Lawson Russell.

485
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,367
I thought they would like the book,

486
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,100
but I had no idea I would
get this kind of reception.

487
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,033
I've never been treated
with such deference,

488
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,067
not even by clients
who were in deep shit.

489
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,067
Thank you.

490
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,067
Congratulations.

491
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,267
Thanks.

492
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,600
How are you doin'?

493
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:51,100
You should never
underestimate the power of art.

494
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:01,067
I'll take it.

495
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
I'll take it.

496
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,800
The New York times book review...

497
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:12,767
"a brilliant indictment of
the criminal justice system,

498
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,967
"probably the season's
best literary offering.

499
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,167
Mr. Russell is a star
of the first magnitude."

500
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,567
Kill a few lawyers,

501
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,133
you're bound to be popular.

502
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,067
You're on your way, buster.

503
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,567
They loved you.

504
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,367
Trust me. This is just the beginning.

505
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,833
You're going to be a very rich man.

506
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,967
It's just hard to believe all this.

507
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,767
It's amazing.

508
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,633
I knew it would make a fortune

509
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,033
before I even finished it.

510
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,567
Yeah?

511
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,467
How could you be so sure?

512
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,300
Made me wet.

513
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,500
Donna, do I have any messages?

514
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Thanks.

515
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,100
It isn't much.

516
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,367
But I call it home.

517
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,567
Very nice.

518
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,967
Intimate.

519
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,400
Daddy built it for me.

520
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:53,233
He must have loved you.

521
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,167
Yes.

522
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Very much.

523
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,400
He gave me everything I ever wanted.

524
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,100
Lucky girl.

525
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:05,100
There are 15 bedrooms.

526
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:07,433
Just enough.

527
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,667
The book hit the New York times
best-seller list at number 6.

528
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,567
Janine had already ordered
a second and third printing.

529
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,367
I ignored the fact that the book
was condemned by the aclu,

530
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,967
the American bar association,

531
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,967
and the trial lawyers association.

532
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,067
I was having way too much fun.

533
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,267
And the name?

534
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,367
Clifford...

535
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,967
2 fs...

536
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,567
Dubose.

537
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,567
Dubose?

538
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,967
Yeah. D-u-b-o-s-e.

539
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,167
Got it. Got it.

540
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,267
It's a great book, man.

541
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,767
Thanks. I love it.

542
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,967
All right.

543
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,367
"Best wishes." Nice.

544
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,700
Poetic.

545
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,367
Hey.

546
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,367
Hi.

547
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,367
What's the name?

548
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
Make it out to Jenny.

549
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:33,633
Jenny.

550
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,067
I really loved it.

551
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,000
I can't wait to read the next one.

552
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,700
Neither can I.

553
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:39,967
Whenever you're ready,

554
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,633
I want to talk to you about an advance.

555
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,967
You make me rich, I make you rich.

556
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's a perfect deal.

557
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:46,000
Hello, Lawson.

558
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:47,000
Pope!

559
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:48,467
What are you doin' here?

560
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,367
Well, you see, my friend wrote this book,

561
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,800
and I thought I'd come by

562
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,100
and get him to sign it for me.

563
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,567
This is my publisher.

564
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,567
Janine devrie, Elizabeth pope.

565
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,567
Hi.

566
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,067
Hi. Nice to meet you.

567
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,567
Elizabeth is an attorney.

568
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,567
Excuse me.

569
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,067
It's good to see you.

570
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,167
You, too.

571
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,367
You look well.

572
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,900
Thanks.

573
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,300
Hope you enjoy it.

574
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,867
I already did.

575
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,433
You read it already?

576
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,400
You hated it.

577
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,500
I thought it was dark.

578
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:27,967
It is.

579
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,567
I never thought of you

580
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,567
writing anything like this.

581
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,967
I mean, it seems somehow
incongruous to me.

582
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,300
Surprised you again.

583
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:41,167
It's just that I didn't
expect anything like this.

584
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,567
That's all.

585
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,967
But, hey, congratulations.

586
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,733
I'm very impressed.

587
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,100
OK, good luck to you, Lawson.

588
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,200
Nice meeting you.

589
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,200
Take care.

590
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,233
Let's get together.

591
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
By all means.

592
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:05,067
It was like I could feel myself falling,

593
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,967
losing touch with the one
decent thing in my life.

594
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,767
It was then that
the magnitude of what I'd done

595
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,167
came home to me.

596
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,700
There would be no next book.

597
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,700
I was a thief.

598
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Now, there's a sight:

599
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:43,767
A lawyer with his hands
in his own pockets.

600
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,967
I forgot.

601
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,867
You're not a lawyer anymore.

602
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,000
You're a big-time writer now.

603
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:52,867
What? Did I miss a little book signin'?

604
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,767
Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Damn.

605
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
And I went and bought my own copy

606
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:57,833
and everything.

607
00:38:57,867 --> 00:38:58,967
Heh...

608
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,233
Thurman.

609
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:02,667
Who let you out of your cage?

610
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,567
Didn't you hear?

611
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,967
I'm a free man.

612
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,100
I was acquitted.

613
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,867
Isn't America great?

614
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,067
Well, where else could a disbarred,

615
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,967
self-righteous...

616
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,967
Piece of shit mouthpiece like you

617
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ride around in a rolls Royce?

618
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:24,967
Are you attacking me?

619
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,567
No, no, wait a minute.
You only attack women,

620
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,900
or is that when you try
to have sex with them?

621
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,467
I forget. I don't know.

622
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,567
Keep laughin', smart ass.

623
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,500
You're gonna get yours.

624
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,367
In spades.

625
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,067
You know, thurman, from the list

626
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,033
of the most despicable
human beings on this planet,

627
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:53,100
you're at the bottom.

628
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:55,967
It was a revelation, representing you,

629
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,767
'cause it was then that I realized

630
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,733
that I couldn't sink any lower.

631
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
That's sweet.

632
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,500
Hello, pussycat.

633
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:10,700
Is this your latest?

634
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,067
Ho...

635
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,433
Affirmative action.

636
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:19,300
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

637
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,767
Good night.

638
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,700
Ho! Ho! Ho!

639
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,967
Hey...

640
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,100
Don't forget to whip it.

641
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,867
Do you know him...

642
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,900
Are you coming?

643
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,900
No, thanks. I'll walk.

644
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,367
Welcome back, detective.

645
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,367
Thanks.

646
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
How you doin', cliff?

647
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:21,200
Worse.

648
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:26,300
God damn it.

649
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,300
Dubose.

650
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,567
Yo.

651
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,900
No, I just walked in
the door this minute.

652
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,100
Jamaica was beautiful, man.

653
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:43,100
Yeah. As a matter of fact,
I did buy some land down there.

654
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,767
That's right, for when I retire.

655
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,967
Since we're on the subject now,

656
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,300
I quit.

657
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,033
OK, OK. You're home.

658
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,967
OK, no casualties.

659
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,033
It won't be long.
We'll be movin' to the island.

660
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:35,067
Then you'll have fresh fish every day.

661
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,500
You're gonna love it.

662
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,700
What are you doing here, cliff?

663
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:06,033
Couldn't sleep?

664
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:07,167
Of course I can sleep.

665
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,900
I can do any fuckin' thing I want.

666
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,833
I'm finished programming.

667
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:23,867
I was just...

668
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,967
Shut the fuck up.

669
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,367
Can you work these machines?

670
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,967
Y... yeah.

671
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,100
Sit down.

672
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,600
Can you access files

673
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:32,967
from the other police departments

674
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,967
in the surrounding states? Yes, sir.

675
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,567
Can you access those files
as per victims' occupations?

676
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,967
Yes, sir. I...

677
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,120
Then type in there "lawyer."

678
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,567
Lawyer?

679
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,467
That's right. Lawyer.

680
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,367
Start with Mississippi...

681
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,600
Biloxi.

682
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:59,067
M-I-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i.

683
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,500
All right, bring it on.

684
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:16,400
Lawson Russell?

685
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:17,867
Who wants to know?

686
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,067
I do. I'm the motherfucker
you've been playin' with.

687
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,967
Hey!

688
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,967
Hey!

689
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,400
Get his left one.

690
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:25,967
What's goin' on?

691
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,233
You're goin' downtown.

692
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:29,800
On what charge?

693
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,967
Arrogance.

694
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,267
OK.

695
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:35,867
Right this way.

696
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,900
Now, watch your head.

697
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:43,300
Read him his rights
and fasten his seat belt.

698
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,500
I had no idea what was going on,

699
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:11,100
but when you're guilty,
you expect the worst.

700
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,467
Yes. Billy ray.

701
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,933
Hello, Lawson.

702
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,667
Guess you already met detective dubose.

703
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,067
Yeah. I offered him a breath mint,

704
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,233
but you know how he is.

705
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:44,800
Want to tell me what's goin' on?

706
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,000
No.

707
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,500
But it's my job.

708
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,833
It's about your book, Lawson.

709
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:54,033
What about it?

710
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:58,133
Well, it seems it's all true.

711
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,300
What?

712
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,667
It's all true.

713
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,367
All 5 of the murders in
your book really happened,

714
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,567
just as you described them,

715
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,367
right down to the last detail.

716
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,800
All of the victims were lawyers.

717
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,800
All of the deaths were
listed as accidents or suicides,

718
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,000
except for the first one,

719
00:46:18,033 --> 00:46:20,167
which appeared to be
a failed robbery attempt,

720
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,167
and all of the murders are connected

721
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,967
by a single motive...

722
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,700
Each of the victims

723
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:29,367
had just won a major legal victory

724
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,367
for an unsavory client,

725
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,600
just as you describe in your book.

726
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:34,667
That's impossible.

727
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,067
I mean, it's some kind of coincidence.

728
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,500
I'm afraid it's not.

729
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,567
See, we're not talkin' about
similarities here, Lawson.

730
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,767
We are talkin'...

731
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,967
About exact details of each crime,

732
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,467
details that were never
released to the press.

733
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,767
I mean, minute details, man,

734
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,233
right down to the color of the car.

735
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:03,367
We are talkin' about things
only the victims

736
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,900
or the killer could've known.

737
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,367
So I need to ask you, Lawson,

738
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,067
where did you get all of the information

739
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,667
for your book?

740
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,900
My legs went numb,
and I couldn't breathe.

741
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,367
I'd been so careful.

742
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,467
I'd destroyed the only
evidence that could prove

743
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,100
that I didn't write the book.

744
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,833
Of course, there's
the distinct possibility

745
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:38,100
that nobody told you any of the details

746
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:39,867
of these murders.

747
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,800
There's a distinct possibility

748
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,700
that one disgusted, disgruntled,

749
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:47,233
disbarred lawyer,

750
00:47:47,267 --> 00:47:49,400
angry at the system that shut him out,

751
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,767
took revenge on the very men

752
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,000
who refused to make
the same moral sacrifice

753
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:55,067
he did.

754
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,233
Nobody had to tell you
any of these details

755
00:47:57,267 --> 00:48:00,433
because you were there, Mr. Russell.

756
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:02,233
You killed those men.

757
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:04,733
You're out of your mind.

758
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,667
Why'd you send me your book?

759
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,767
What?

760
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,467
Is that not your handwritin'?

761
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,367
You just couldn't stand the idea

762
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,467
of people not knowing

763
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,576
about your accomplishments,

764
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,767
could you?

765
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,167
I mean, what's the sense

766
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,967
of committing the perfect crime

767
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,367
if nobody knows about it?

768
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,167
So you set it down

769
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,967
detail-per-detail, didn't you?

770
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,967
And you sent a copy to the one person

771
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,567
you knew could understand it:

772
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,467
The detective that worked the first case.

773
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,667
You sent me that book,
didn't you, counselor?

774
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Because you wanted me to catch you.

775
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,067
Didn't you?

776
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,500
I'd like to speak to an attorney.

777
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,700
Good luck findin' one.

778
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,567
Thanks for coming.

779
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,967
What the hell is goin' on, Lawson?

780
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,967
A really big misunderstanding.

781
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,367
You are being investigated
for 5 counts of homicide.

782
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,009
Well, I'm tellin' you,
it's some kind of mistake.

783
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:37,567
No. There's no mistake.

784
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,367
That's the list of victims.

785
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,367
They died exactly how you described it

786
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,767
in your book.

787
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,233
I didn't kill anybody,
I promise you that.

788
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:47,167
Then you're going to
have to explain to them

789
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,967
where you got your information.

790
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,167
Am I being charged? No, not yet.

791
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,100
They want to hear your story first.

792
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,367
They won't believe it.

793
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,100
Try me, then.

794
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,833
What are my options?

795
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:10,967
You don't have any.

796
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,500
You have to cooperate.

797
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,100
Tell them where you got your facts.

798
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:17,967
The law does not respect
protection of sources

799
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,067
in capital crimes.

800
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,567
Hell, you should know that.

801
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,833
It's obstruction of justice,

802
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:25,967
plus accessory after the fact,

803
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,167
harboring a fugitive.

804
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,067
Man, if they really want to get nasty:

805
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,167
Involuntary manslaughter.

806
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,000
You'll go to jail, Lawson.

807
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:33,200
OK, OK, all right.

808
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,800
Tell them that I need time
to confer with counsel

809
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,400
and to prepare a statement.

810
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:39,109
Tell them I'll be more
than happy to cooperate

811
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:42,567
in every way possible,
including naming my source,

812
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,167
but I need out of here now.

813
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,367
Lawson...

814
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,667
Pope, please...

815
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,033
Just do it.

816
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,100
Man.

817
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,000
He's guilty.

818
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,067
How can you tell?

819
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,667
Watch. He'll look back.

820
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,567
When the perp's holdin',
they always look back.

821
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,767
Dubose here.

822
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,567
Rabbit's on the track.

823
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,167
Set the hounds loose.

824
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,767
Billy ray, old buddy,

825
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,567
I need a search warrant.

826
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,200
I know just the judge.

827
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:32,400
Satisfied?

828
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:33,967
I can't believe this.

829
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,600
But it was true.

830
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:37,967
Each one of the murders in the book

831
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,900
documented an actual killing.

832
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,967
I was... to use the vernacular...

833
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,167
Fucked.

834
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,100
I didn't write the book.

835
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:50,067
What?

836
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,967
I didn't write the book.

837
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,467
It was given to me

838
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,067
by an old man I met in key west.

839
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,100
He gave me the original
manuscript to read,

840
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:02,067
and then he died of a heart attack.

841
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,967
I got greedy. I put my name on it.

842
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,067
I submitted it,

843
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,900
and it bup bup bup bup!

844
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:12,400
You expect me to believe that?

845
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:13,967
No, no. Hell, I don't even believe it,

846
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,167
but it's true.

847
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,967
Listen, you said yourself
when you read it

848
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,967
it didn't sound anything like me.

849
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,200
I'm guilty of plagiarism, not murder.

850
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:25,367
So where's the original manuscript?

851
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,967
I burned it.

852
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,967
Great.

853
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,967
So the old man from key west

854
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,567
is the real killer,

855
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,300
is that what you're tellin' me?

856
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,567
Yes.

857
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,767
Maybe. I don't know.

858
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,067
Maybe he just knew the killer.

859
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,967
You don't believe me.

860
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,100
I don't know what to believe.

861
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:49,100
What are you doing?

862
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,600
I don't think you should
say any more to me.

863
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:53,867
What are you talkin' about?
This is privileged.

864
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,567
No, it is not.

865
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,967
I am not representing you in this.

866
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,700
Pope.

867
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:01,243
I think you'd better seek other counsel.

868
00:53:01,267 --> 00:53:02,233
No. Pope, listen.

869
00:53:02,267 --> 00:53:03,167
Pope, listen, listen, listen.

870
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,867
I'm sorry, Lawson.

871
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,867
I need your help.

872
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,967
There was a time

873
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,167
when I would have done anything for you,

874
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,000
but I don't know who
you are anymore, Lawson.

875
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:18,967
I can't help you.

876
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,900
I'm not sure anybody can.

877
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:29,033
Pope.

878
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:30,067
Pope.

879
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,700
Your parents sure must be proud.

880
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:01,600
Very funny.

881
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,067
May I help you?

882
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,900
Hey! What the hell's goin' on here?!

883
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,700
Maybe this'll explain things, counsel.

884
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,367
Now, let me ask you,

885
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,167
a fine legal mind like yourself,

886
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,833
are you cooperatin'?

887
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,167
Because if you're not...

888
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,867
I'm cooperating.

889
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,967
Excellent!

890
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,567
Boys!

891
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,267
Mr. Russell's just given us permission

892
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,967
to be particularly destructive.

893
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Carry on.

894
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:03,800
Like a drink, detective?

895
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,567
Nah. Never touch it.

896
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,733
Makes me happy.

897
00:55:16,033 --> 00:55:20,433
You know, Russell, I kind of admire you.

898
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,200
Yeah.

899
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:25,367
I think it's a hell of an idea,

900
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,700
knocking off those scumbag lawyers,

901
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:30,900
letting all these guilty men go free

902
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:32,967
to continue preying on society.

903
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,833
Yes, sir, it's a damn fine idea.

904
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:40,567
Goddamn shame it's illegal, though,

905
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,167
isn't it?

906
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,500
I enjoyed your book.

907
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:48,300
Lot of creepy shit in there, man.

908
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,033
I was particularly enamored

909
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:54,033
with the analogy to crows.

910
00:55:54,067 --> 00:55:55,600
That's the right word, isn't it?

911
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:56,867
Analogy?

912
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,800
I mean, they're extremely intelligent,

913
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:07,400
wary... omnivorous.

914
00:56:07,433 --> 00:56:11,800
They're also extremely
protective of each other.

915
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,000
A very successful species.

916
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:14,000
You know their numbers

917
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:16,100
are exploding in this country?

918
00:56:16,133 --> 00:56:18,400
Just like lawyers.

919
00:56:20,033 --> 00:56:22,400
That'd be a metaphor, right?

920
00:56:22,433 --> 00:56:25,133
Or is it a simile? Whatever.

921
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:35,067
You know, you barbecued me
on the stand once.

922
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,133
You remember that?

923
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:39,633
Vaguely.

924
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:43,433
You like being a smart ass, don't you?

925
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:46,100
Must be a genetic trait
with your profession,

926
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:47,433
like overcharging.

927
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,600
And you all just love
attacking the police.

928
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,300
Makes your day.

929
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,000
Bringing in those high-priced,

930
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:57,000
so-called experts.

931
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:59,233
Earn 10 times as much
as we do to tear apart

932
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:01,167
our investigations and lab work.

933
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,433
While we're underpaid,
overworked, understaffed,

934
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:04,976
and constantly being
pushed into the ground

935
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,009
as if we were the criminals.

936
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:07,367
Some of you are.

937
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,833
Takes a team effort

938
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:10,627
to have the highest
crime rate in the nation.

939
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,067
Now you're being downright offensive.

940
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,100
We both are.

941
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,967
The difference is I'm trying to be.

942
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,100
But you just can't help it.

943
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:34,067
You know, I followed that parks trial.

944
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,100
Our boy thurman was guilty, wasn't he?

945
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:38,900
How did that deal come down?

946
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:41,900
I mean, why did you
snap on him like that?

947
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:45,600
Too many twinkies.

948
00:57:47,533 --> 00:57:50,800
That sounded expensive.

949
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,033
Lieutenant, you better look at this.

950
00:57:57,867 --> 00:58:00,267
My, my.

951
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,500
I found them in the kitchen,

952
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:04,467
underneath the cabinets.

953
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,067
Well, lookie here.
Well, that's a good one.

954
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,767
No wonder you had all the details right.

955
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,767
You took pictures!

956
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,000
That's not mine.

957
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:14,167
I've never seen that stuff before.

958
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,400
No, really?

959
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:18,167
Well, I guess we'd just
better let you go?

960
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,633
Wait, listen. I'm being framed!

961
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,500
Get your hands behind your back now.

962
00:58:21,533 --> 00:58:23,767
This is my favorite part of the job.

963
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,033
Lawson Russell, you're under arrest

964
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:27,200
on 5 counts of murder.

965
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:38,033
Damn!

966
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,300
Shit!

967
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:43,033
The goddamn rabbit's loose!

968
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:46,100
Repeat, the rabbit's loose.

969
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,400
The New Orleans police department

970
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:53,200
is actively seeking Lawson Russell

971
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,567
in connection with the murders

972
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,633
of 5 prominent attorneys

973
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:59,800
depicted in his book a murder of crows.

974
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:08,033
How sad. Ho ho!!

975
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:10,300
Mr. Russell escaped custody
earlier this afternoon

976
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,067
and is currently at large.

977
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,833
Come here, baby girl.

978
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,900
It's time to play the escaped convict

979
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:20,467
and the warden's wife.

980
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,500
My.

981
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:25,900
Ms. devrie, did you have any idea

982
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,709
that a murder of crows
was based on real events?

983
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:29,433
None whatsoever. I'm shocked.

984
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:33,000
What is the publishing
company's position on this?

985
00:59:33,033 --> 00:59:34,667
Devrie publishing only wants

986
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,300
to see justice served.

987
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,000
I hope that the police apprehend

988
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,367
this maniac quickly

989
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,367
and that he is made to pay severely

990
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,467
for these crimes.

991
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,633
When was the last time...

992
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:45,633
How was I?

993
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:46,667
Brilliant.

994
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,100
This book is gonna go through the roof.

995
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,367
My father loved the law.

996
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,100
He saw in its pursuit

997
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:14,000
the highest achievement of man... justice.

998
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:15,967
And "a little bit
of justice," he used to say,

999
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,467
"is all we count for."

1000
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,767
Before I went off to college at Yale,

1001
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,767
he gave me 3 pieces of advice.

1002
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,100
Never waste the opportunity

1003
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:27,067
to tell someone you love them,

1004
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,767
never take the credit or the blame

1005
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,100
for something you didn't do,

1006
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:32,267
and always tell the truth.

1007
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,433
It's easier to remember.

1008
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,033
Thank god he was dead.

1009
01:00:51,033 --> 01:00:52,567
- Hi.
- Hi.

1010
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,676
I'm trying to find out what happened

1011
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,567
to the personal effects
of a man who died here

1012
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,067
in key west earlier this year?

1013
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,243
All right. What was the name?

1014
01:00:58,267 --> 01:01:00,967
Last name, marlowe. Christopher marlowe.

1015
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:04,367
When did he die?

1016
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,600
March third.

1017
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,367
I'm not showing any marlowe, sir.

1018
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,033
Are you sure he died here?

1019
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:16,100
Positive.

1020
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,600
Well, we have no record of it.

1021
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:24,800
It's gotta be in there somewhere.

1022
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:26,600
Well, if he died in Monroe county,

1023
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:28,043
a death certificate would be on file.

1024
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:30,200
Do you have an attending
physician's name?

1025
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,900
No, I don't have a physician's name.

1026
01:01:31,933 --> 01:01:32,900
I spoke to a detective

1027
01:01:32,933 --> 01:01:34,367
at the key west police department,

1028
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,100
detective goethe?

1029
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:39,033
Goethe? Goethe?

1030
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:40,933
You mean like the German writer?

1031
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,033
You know, I don't think there is

1032
01:01:46,067 --> 01:01:48,967
a detective goethe on the force, sir.

1033
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,409
Maybe you all have the wrong county.

1034
01:01:50,433 --> 01:01:52,100
She was part right.

1035
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:54,433
I was on the wrong planet.

1036
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:56,800
I had to retool my thinking.

1037
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:59,067
Everything I knew was wrong.

1038
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:09,567
Christopher marlowe
was the english writer

1039
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,667
who first interpreted
the medieval legend faust,

1040
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,300
the man who sold his soul to the devil.

1041
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,233
Goethe, of course, was the German poet

1042
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,767
whose crowning work, faust,

1043
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,500
was the most famous version of the tale.

1044
01:02:24,267 --> 01:02:25,876
I'd been tempted by the devil, all right,

1045
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,033
and sold my soul lock, stock, and barrel.

1046
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:42,467
Shit.

1047
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:06,100
One park 14, com one.

1048
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:07,133
He's here.

1049
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:52,567
Hi.

1050
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,900
Are you Mrs. Evans?

1051
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:54,900
Yes.

1052
01:03:54,933 --> 01:03:56,000
I'm inspector Harris

1053
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:58,167
of the department
of justice. May I come in?

1054
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,767
Am I in some kind of trouble?

1055
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,900
No, ma'am. I'm investigating a man

1056
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:02,976
who was a tenant in this rooming house

1057
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,067
in march of this year.

1058
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,033
A one Christopher marlowe?

1059
01:04:06,067 --> 01:04:07,467
Wore glasses, walked with a cane,

1060
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,467
english accent?

1061
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,000
Sure, Mr. marlowe. I remember him.

1062
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:12,200
What did he do?

1063
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:14,767
I'm not at Liberty to say, ma'am.

1064
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,467
How long did he stay here?

1065
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,467
Just about a week,

1066
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,467
and he seemed like a nice enough man.

1067
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,467
Paid in cash.

1068
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,067
Did he leave a forwarding address?

1069
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,267
No.

1070
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,267
Did he meet with anyone
while he was staying here?

1071
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,067
No, not that I know of.

1072
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,833
This subpoena, as you will see,

1073
01:04:28,867 --> 01:04:30,067
requests the phone records

1074
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,509
of this rooming house
while he stayed here.

1075
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:33,033
No, no, no, no.

1076
01:04:33,067 --> 01:04:35,033
He didn't use the phone here.

1077
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:36,500
And I thought that was odd.

1078
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:38,033
He always used the pay phone

1079
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:39,033
on the corner.

1080
01:04:39,067 --> 01:04:41,067
The pay phone?!

1081
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:45,767
Thank you, Mrs. Evans.

1082
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,067
You're welcome.

1083
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,000
The supervisor at ma bell

1084
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:58,033
was even more cooperative
than Mrs. Evans.

1085
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:00,733
Sometimes life just works out that way.

1086
01:05:31,067 --> 01:05:32,433
We are police!

1087
01:05:32,467 --> 01:05:34,000
Stop!

1088
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,167
Stop running!

1089
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,533
Freeze!

1090
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:40,333
Hey, stop!

1091
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:43,067
Hey!

1092
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,467
Car 4-14 calling com one.

1093
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,967
I'm pursuing suspect,

1094
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,076
he went over a fence at calder alley.

1095
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,400
I'm proceeding to Elizabeth.

1096
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:07,700
Attention, all units
in vicinity of calder alley...

1097
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,900
We lost him.

1098
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,567
The FBI is here.

1099
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,867
Fuck 'em.

1100
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,033
Well, you're gonna
need to confer with 'em.

1101
01:07:36,067 --> 01:07:39,433
What for, Billy ray?

1102
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:40,967
So we do all the work

1103
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,067
and they get to give
the press conference?

1104
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,900
I would've thought you wanted to do that.

1105
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:50,600
This is the one he poisoned.

1106
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,967
They exhumed the body this morning.

1107
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,200
I assume you heard about key west?

1108
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:58,300
It's a bonehead move, if you ask me.

1109
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:00,267
I figured he'd be long gone by now.

1110
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:01,600
South America, maybe.

1111
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:03,100
No way.

1112
01:08:03,133 --> 01:08:05,567
He's on his way back to the big easy.

1113
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,567
You think?

1114
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,500
I know it.

1115
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:10,600
The man's not finished.

1116
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:12,000
He's got another lawyer to get.

1117
01:08:12,033 --> 01:08:13,767
Who?

1118
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,600
Himself.

1119
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,033
Why do you think he sent me his book?

1120
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,567
I took a flight from Miami to Baton Rouge

1121
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,667
and caught a greyhound down to the city.

1122
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,067
All the calls from the phone booth

1123
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,267
in key west were local

1124
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:45,033
except for one in the 504 area code.

1125
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,767
New Orleans. My home town.

1126
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,900
The phone was listed
to a miss althea delroy,

1127
01:08:50,933 --> 01:08:53,933
616 Jackson street
in the garden district.

1128
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:58,033
Thurman parks lived
in the garden district.

1129
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,333
I didn't think it was a coincidence.

1130
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,367
I wanted to see if althea delroy's number

1131
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,033
was in thurman park's book.

1132
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:52,067
It wasn't.

1133
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:53,900
The whole thing didn't add up.

1134
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,033
Get on.

1135
01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:09,200
But from the sound of it,

1136
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:10,800
thurman and Janine did.

1137
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:12,233
I ain't drunk.

1138
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:14,867
Look at this ass. Nice!

1139
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,000
You're so bad!

1140
01:10:16,033 --> 01:10:17,033
Well...

1141
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:18,567
That's what you love about me, baby.

1142
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,000
Reminded me of the old story

1143
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,600
of Adam and Eve.

1144
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:25,767
Adam, exasperated with Eve,

1145
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,867
asked god why he made her so beautiful.

1146
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,200
"So that you would
love her," god replied.

1147
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:34,000
"Why did you make her so stupid?"

1148
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:36,600
And god said, "so she would love you."

1149
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,400
God damn it, get off me. You're such a...

1150
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:44,233
They deserved each other.

1151
01:10:44,267 --> 01:10:45,300
Get off!

1152
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,067
Yeah!

1153
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,967
Little thing, come on, resist me.

1154
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,467
Fight me, baby! Fight me!

1155
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,600
All right...

1156
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:55,067
Come on!

1157
01:10:58,433 --> 01:11:02,033
It used to be over that hotel...

1158
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,700
Elizabeth pope.

1159
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:09,267
Hi. It's me.

1160
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:12,867
I can't talk to you. I could go to jail.

1161
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,967
I know.

1162
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,667
I need your help, pope.

1163
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,000
The legal database
report Elizabeth gave me

1164
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:33,200
said that Mrs. althea delroy
was a widowed housekeeper.

1165
01:12:33,233 --> 01:12:34,967
She had a 10-year-old daughter and lived

1166
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,467
in a 2-bedroom condo on Jackson street.

1167
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,100
She owed 59,000 bucks on it.

1168
01:12:42,133 --> 01:12:43,500
What she had to do with all this

1169
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:45,100
was anybody's guess.

1170
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,233
Come on, kids! This way!

1171
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:44,700
Theme is the controlling idea

1172
01:14:44,733 --> 01:14:46,033
of a play.

1173
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:47,500
It's the single thought

1174
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:50,467
which the playwright tries
to prove by his own work.

1175
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:55,667
Can anybody tell me what
the theme of MacBeth is?

1176
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,200
Iaura.

1177
01:14:57,233 --> 01:15:00,233
If you're greedy, it leads to disaster.

1178
01:15:00,267 --> 01:15:03,200
Is it really greed, though?

1179
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:05,400
MacBeth is more than that. James.

1180
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:07,367
He's more ambitious.

1181
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,067
He's ambitious, isn't he?

1182
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,433
How ambitious?

1183
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,867
Ruthlessly, would you say?

1184
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,033
So, Shakespeare set out to prove

1185
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:20,967
that ruthless ambition
leads to its own destruction.

1186
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,200
I think he did that.

1187
01:15:22,233 --> 01:15:24,000
I figured the professor would

1188
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:25,867
be tied up for at least an hour.

1189
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,300
It's time to see where
the bodies were buried.

1190
01:15:40,067 --> 01:15:42,467
[Doorbell rings]

1191
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,600
I'd never broken
into anyone's house before.

1192
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,000
Must be a good way.

1193
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,567
I didn't know one.

1194
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,200
His name was Arthur corvus.

1195
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:53,167
I saw all the photographs
of his wife and daughter.

1196
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,900
They could be coming home any minute.

1197
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,267
The daughter's room was musty-smelling.

1198
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,033
I figured she was away
at boarding school.

1199
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:05,567
So he didn't know thurman parks III.

1200
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,967
But he was a professor of drama.

1201
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,900
He taught acting, theater history,

1202
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:11,833
playwriting.

1203
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,200
What was his connection to marlowe?

1204
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:24,800
I spent too many years
listening to bullshit

1205
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,700
to not know it when I see it.

1206
01:18:26,733 --> 01:18:30,333
There had to be a connection.

1207
01:19:54,433 --> 01:19:56,500
Well, if it weren't
for lawyers, dear boy,

1208
01:19:56,533 --> 01:19:58,667
we wouldn't need lawyers.

1209
01:20:08,033 --> 01:20:09,233
Night.

1210
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,500
Nice... poetic.

1211
01:20:19,533 --> 01:20:21,300
Thanks.

1212
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:28,067
Ruthless ambition leads
to its own destruction.

1213
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:39,833
OK, professor, thanks.

1214
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:44,867
How you doing?

1215
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,000
Good.

1216
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:54,667
Professor?!

1217
01:20:56,333 --> 01:20:58,300
Professor!

1218
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,433
Rod, what happened?

1219
01:21:02,467 --> 01:21:04,200
Somebody broke into your house.

1220
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,200
God.

1221
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:06,967
I live here. Go ahead.

1222
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Thank you.

1223
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:12,500
Althea?

1224
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:13,567
Professor...

1225
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,067
Thank god.

1226
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,067
Are you all right?

1227
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,867
I'm fine. He didn't hurt me.

1228
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:18,967
He just walked right out.

1229
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,267
Who? Lawson Russell.

1230
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,633
Who?

1231
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:24,067
Lawson Russell.

1232
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,567
The author of that novel,

1233
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,033
a murder of crows.

1234
01:21:27,067 --> 01:21:29,300
The one who knocked
off all those lawyers.

1235
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:31,633
You haven't read about this guy?

1236
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:32,967
Yes, I've read about him.

1237
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,667
I just thought that you were mistaken.

1238
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,433
No, no. It was him, all right.

1239
01:21:36,467 --> 01:21:38,100
I looked him right in his face.

1240
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,167
Well, what in the world
would he want here?

1241
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,633
Well, that's what we want to know.

1242
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,433
I'm detective dubose,

1243
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:48,000
New Orleans police department,

1244
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,000
homicide.

1245
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:50,067
How do you do?

1246
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,567
Tell you the truth, professor,

1247
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,300
I'm as confused as a nun

1248
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:55,000
on a honeymoon.

1249
01:21:55,033 --> 01:21:56,567
May I show you something?

1250
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,033
Over here...

1251
01:21:58,067 --> 01:22:01,367
Apparently, he broke the window

1252
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,000
on the back door there.

1253
01:22:03,033 --> 01:22:05,267
Let himself in, he was upstairs

1254
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,100
when the housekeeper came home.

1255
01:22:07,133 --> 01:22:08,467
How strange.

1256
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,700
Yeah, ain't it?

1257
01:22:09,733 --> 01:22:11,900
Well, you know these serial killers,

1258
01:22:11,933 --> 01:22:13,433
totally unpredictable.

1259
01:22:13,467 --> 01:22:14,833
You may just want to check around

1260
01:22:14,867 --> 01:22:16,043
and see if anything's missing.

1261
01:22:16,067 --> 01:22:18,167
Yes, sir. I'll make it
a point to do that.

1262
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,367
Hey, professor?

1263
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,633
Yeah?

1264
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:22,900
You never met Lawson Russell before?

1265
01:22:22,933 --> 01:22:24,433
No. Thank god.

1266
01:22:24,467 --> 01:22:25,967
Know anybody who knows him?

1267
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,100
I don't think so.

1268
01:22:29,133 --> 01:22:31,667
So I guess you never read his book,

1269
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,100
murder of crows?

1270
01:22:33,133 --> 01:22:34,733
No, sir.

1271
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,967
Well...

1272
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Maybe he was just
hiding out here for a while.

1273
01:22:41,033 --> 01:22:42,033
Yes, quite possibly.

1274
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:43,033
Professor?

1275
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:48,400
Your housekeeper, Mrs. delroy,

1276
01:22:48,433 --> 01:22:50,867
she says you teach
over at the university.

1277
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,033
Yes, I do.

1278
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,000
That wouldn't be law, would it?

1279
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:56,033
No, I teach theater.

1280
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:59,100
Acting?

1281
01:22:59,133 --> 01:23:01,500
Yes, among other things.

1282
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,067
That your family?

1283
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,067
Agent Manning, FBI. Who's in charge here?

1284
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,367
Detective dubose.

1285
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,033
Christ.

1286
01:23:12,067 --> 01:23:15,667
Here they come, the thorns in my ass.

1287
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,000
Are you dubose?

1288
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:19,667
No, I'm the fucking easter bunny.

1289
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,133
Nice suit, Ace.

1290
01:23:35,467 --> 01:23:38,167
Aristotle said, "all that we do is done"

1291
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,167
with an eye towards something else."

1292
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,067
To understand a deed,

1293
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,667
look to the motive.

1294
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,467
Jeffrey lowell was the first

1295
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,067
of the 5 lawyers murdered.

1296
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,767
I reasoned that if there
was any personal connection

1297
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,567
between the victims and the killer,

1298
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,500
it would be with the first murder.

1299
01:23:59,533 --> 01:24:01,667
The messiest of the 5, the most violent.

1300
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,467
I had to go back nearly 3 years

1301
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,600
before I found it.

1302
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:22,800
Jeffrey lowell represented
a banker from Baton Rouge

1303
01:24:22,833 --> 01:24:25,033
charged with hit-and-run driving.

1304
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:26,100
A woman and her daughter

1305
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:27,967
were killed in the accident.

1306
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,200
The victims' names were
Jean and Trudy corvus.

1307
01:24:33,233 --> 01:24:35,033
Lowell had the case thrown out of court

1308
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:36,200
on a technicality.

1309
01:24:36,233 --> 01:24:38,000
The investigating officer failed to,

1310
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:39,200
as the court put it,

1311
01:24:39,233 --> 01:24:41,767
"properly advise
the banker of his rights."

1312
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,600
The banker walked,

1313
01:24:43,633 --> 01:24:45,233
and a serial killer was born.

1314
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:46,333
There he is!

1315
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,300
Not a good start for your career.

1316
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,067
Busting everything!

1317
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:31,733
I'll take that firearm,
please. Thank you.

1318
01:26:33,867 --> 01:26:35,376
I'm very glad that you could come here

1319
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,100
and talk to me.

1320
01:26:37,133 --> 01:26:38,767
Why don't you just come on in here

1321
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,267
and stay for a spell?

1322
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:44,633
OK. Sit on down.

1323
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,167
What, you're not gonna give me

1324
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,633
any of that courtroom arrogance?

1325
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:54,733
Not gonna smile for me?

1326
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:01,933
Well...

1327
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:07,433
I got to tell you, I'm impressed.

1328
01:27:07,467 --> 01:27:09,867
You have given me quite a day,

1329
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,900
Mr. Russell.

1330
01:27:12,933 --> 01:27:14,633
But then again, you've always been

1331
01:27:14,667 --> 01:27:18,100
kind of unpredictable, haven't you?

1332
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:19,633
Like that evening in your study

1333
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,967
when you called judge banning,

1334
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,367
withdrew yourself from the parks case.

1335
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,767
I'll tell you, you know, that threw me.

1336
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,900
That threw me.

1337
01:27:30,933 --> 01:27:32,233
It impressed me so much

1338
01:27:32,267 --> 01:27:35,433
that I decided not to kill you.

1339
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:37,767
So I was always on your hit list.

1340
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,700
Yeah. Well, you see,

1341
01:27:40,733 --> 01:27:43,067
I decided to test you in the way

1342
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,867
god tested job.

1343
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:46,600
The book.

1344
01:27:46,633 --> 01:27:47,733
Yes, sir.

1345
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:53,833
I loved the faust thing,
by the way. Very clever.

1346
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,567
Thank you.

1347
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,367
You know...

1348
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,033
Quite a piece of work.

1349
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:05,900
I can see why you felt
compelled to share it.

1350
01:28:05,933 --> 01:28:09,033
Yes, it was a story
that needed to be told.

1351
01:28:09,067 --> 01:28:11,667
Sorry about your family, though.

1352
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,333
I'm sure that was hard.

1353
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,833
You have no idea how it felt...

1354
01:28:19,867 --> 01:28:21,300
Watching that man go free

1355
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:24,633
after he killed them.

1356
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:28,567
You see, I could tell from his eyes

1357
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,067
that he was remorseful
for what he'd done.

1358
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:36,033
But his lawyer... His lawyer smiled...

1359
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:38,367
And patted him on the back.

1360
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,233
I'll tell you something, Lawson.

1361
01:28:40,267 --> 01:28:42,633
Something turned in me then.

1362
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:45,300
I felt a rage inside of
me, and I swear to god,

1363
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:48,400
I tried to put it out of my mind.

1364
01:28:48,433 --> 01:28:51,000
I tried to turn the other cheek.

1365
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:53,967
"Vengeance is mine, saith the lord."

1366
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,867
But I couldn't wait for it.

1367
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,567
You see, he wasn't practicing law!

1368
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,267
He was hiding behind it!

1369
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:03,000
He was using it as a hammer

1370
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:05,400
to protect the privileged in our society!

1371
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:08,433
See, he was like you, Lawson.

1372
01:29:08,467 --> 01:29:10,867
See, you weren't interested in justice,

1373
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,700
you just wanted to win

1374
01:29:12,733 --> 01:29:15,300
'cause it fed your pathetic little ego!

1375
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,233
And it fed your pocketbook.

1376
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:19,000
For a little bit of money,

1377
01:29:19,033 --> 01:29:21,700
you gave away your goddamn integrity!

1378
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:24,100
For a little bit of money,

1379
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:26,033
you frustrated justice.

1380
01:29:26,067 --> 01:29:27,033
Well, I'm here to tell you,

1381
01:29:27,067 --> 01:29:29,300
for all the people that you destroyed,

1382
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:31,633
I want a little goddamn justice,

1383
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:34,100
and I want it right now!

1384
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,667
Stand up. Stand up.

1385
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:44,800
Come on. Move away.

1386
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:51,167
Come on. It's a shame
I'm gonna have to kill you

1387
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,600
for violating my home.

1388
01:29:55,467 --> 01:29:57,067
You sold your soul to the devil,

1389
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,600
Mr. Lawson Russell.

1390
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:02,033
And the devil has come to collect.

1391
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,433
May god have mercy on your soul.

1392
01:30:12,467 --> 01:30:14,000
Put the gun down, professor.

1393
01:30:18,267 --> 01:30:19,267
Put it down.

1394
01:30:22,433 --> 01:30:24,600
I will kill him.

1395
01:30:24,633 --> 01:30:26,300
It's your carpet.

1396
01:30:27,733 --> 01:30:29,500
Come on, now. It's over.

1397
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:31,200
Put it down.

1398
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,100
Drop it.

1399
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:49,033
And step back. Come on. Step back.

1400
01:30:55,933 --> 01:30:56,900
Thanks.

1401
01:30:56,933 --> 01:30:58,500
Yeah, don't mention it.

1402
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:00,233
Officer needs assistance.

1403
01:31:00,267 --> 01:31:02,267
1741 coliseum.

1404
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,967
You may recall, Mr. Russell,

1405
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
that, this is the favorite part

1406
01:31:08,033 --> 01:31:09,100
of my job.

1407
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:12,067
Unh!

1408
01:31:21,033 --> 01:31:22,133
No!

1409
01:31:28,033 --> 01:31:29,033
You're insane.

1410
01:31:30,667 --> 01:31:32,767
No.

1411
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:33,800
No.

1412
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:39,633
I didn't kill him.

1413
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:41,233
You killed him.

1414
01:31:43,633 --> 01:31:45,300
And he killed you.

1415
01:31:47,133 --> 01:31:48,467
With that gun.

1416
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,500
Oof!

1417
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Oof!

1418
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:09,000
Look at me!

1419
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:27,376
It was then that I realized

1420
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,900
I was holding the gun that killed dubose.

1421
01:32:29,933 --> 01:32:31,800
My gun, my fingerprints.

1422
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:33,800
It was me the cops were looking for.

1423
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,267
My name was on the book.

1424
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,500
It's your word against mine, isn't it?

1425
01:32:39,533 --> 01:32:40,667
Isn't it?

1426
01:32:42,733 --> 01:32:45,600
Yeah. That's right.

1427
01:32:45,633 --> 01:32:47,900
A teacher and a Deacon in the church

1428
01:32:47,933 --> 01:32:50,500
versus a lawyer?

1429
01:32:50,533 --> 01:32:52,967
And a disbarred lawyer at that.

1430
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:59,200
Man. I think you're
in a world of trouble.

1431
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:01,033
I'd run if I were you.

1432
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:03,667
He was right.

1433
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,709
I was going down for this,

1434
01:33:04,733 --> 01:33:07,100
and there was no doubt about it.

1435
01:33:07,133 --> 01:33:09,267
Corvus was going to go free.

1436
01:33:12,067 --> 01:33:13,733
I am not innocent.

1437
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,633
But you are guilty.

1438
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:38,400
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

1439
01:34:38,433 --> 01:34:40,733
OK.

1440
01:34:47,467 --> 01:34:48,833
All the publicity sent the book

1441
01:34:48,867 --> 01:34:50,067
through the roof.

1442
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,633
The royalties made me a millionaire.

1443
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,833
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1444
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:58,333
We have, your honor.

1445
01:35:02,633 --> 01:35:04,267
Elizabeth found me one of the best

1446
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:08,000
criminal defense
attorneys in the country.

1447
01:35:08,033 --> 01:35:11,200
But, unfortunately,
my old pal, judge banning,

1448
01:35:11,233 --> 01:35:12,233
drew the case.

1449
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,633
Defendant will rise.

1450
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,133
Bailiff will read the verdict.

1451
01:35:23,067 --> 01:35:24,300
Whatever the jury's decision,

1452
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,000
I was prepared to accept it.

1453
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,267
"We, the jury, find the defendant.

1454
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,633
"Lawson Russell...

1455
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:33,400
Not guilty."

1456
01:36:11,033 --> 01:36:12,700
I'll say it again,

1457
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:15,267
it's an immutable fact of life.

1458
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:19,433
The strong will always tread on the weak.

1459
01:36:19,467 --> 01:36:21,567
But every once in a while,

1460
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,833
we get a little bit of justice.

1461
01:36:24,867 --> 01:36:27,100
And that's all we can hope for.

1467
01:36:50,033 --> 01:36:55,233
* I never was a believer *

1468
01:36:55,267 --> 01:37:01,167
* until you came and showed me the way *

1469
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,100
* just like the rays of light *

1470
01:37:04,133 --> 01:37:08,067
* that turn each night

1471
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:12,233
* into day

1472
01:37:12,267 --> 01:37:13,967
* and all the doubts

1473
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
* I could not live without *

1474
01:37:17,033 --> 01:37:23,267
* they all drown
in the depth of your love *

1475
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,100
* you fell down

1476
01:37:25,133 --> 01:37:27,300
* on my desert one day

1477
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:32,967
* like a rain from above *

1478
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,667
* I put my faith in you

1479
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,167
* lay it down for you

1480
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:44,000
* and only you

1481
01:37:44,033 --> 01:37:49,467
* upon your wings I fly, so high *

1482
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:55,433
* forever put my faith in you *

1483
01:37:55,467 --> 01:38:03,467
* I put my faith in you

1484
01:38:05,067 --> 01:38:07,733
* hoo hoo hoo hoo

1485
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,100
* I used to think I knew freedom *

1486
01:38:15,133 --> 01:38:21,233
* when I would live
to please someone else *

1487
01:38:21,267 --> 01:38:25,400
* but you embrace me for all that I am *

1488
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:32,067
* you love me for myself *

1489
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,100
* and like a rock

1490
01:38:34,133 --> 01:38:37,100
* that remains strong and true *

1491
01:38:37,133 --> 01:38:43,300
* you anchor my heart and my soul *

1492
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:47,400
* and if this world is ever incomplete *

1493
01:38:47,433 --> 01:38:53,000
* you're the one who makes it whole *

1494
01:38:53,033 --> 01:38:57,700
