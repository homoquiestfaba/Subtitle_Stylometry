1
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,106
(distant male voice)
 Lily...

2
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,982
Where are you, Lily?

3
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,482
Lily!

4
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,592
Where are you?

5
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,911
[bell rings]

6
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,057
Lily!

7
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,294
Lily...

8
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,929
Where are you, Lily?

9
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,667
Lily...

10
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,643
Lily!

11
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:10,451
I'm coming,
Grandma!

12
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,592
Come on, Joey.

13
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,931
I've been callin' and callin'.

14
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,066
Ooh, look at you!

15
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,869
You are filthy!
And no shoes?

16
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,237
Where's your brains?

17
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,341
Your Granddad killed
a four-foot rattler

18
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,309
down there only last week.

19
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,243
Really?

20
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,746
Yeah. Watch your feet
on these thorns here.

21
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,283
And you know, there's water
moccasins down there, too.

22
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,253
You gotta listen
to me Lily...

23
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,888
You do.

24
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,259
You could at least wear shoes.

25
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,448
Hey, Grandpa.

26
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,116
What'd ya get me today?

27
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,818
Hey, Sunshine.

28
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,687
Where's Grandpa's hug?

29
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,925
Is it M & M's?

30
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,094
Nothin.
I didn't get you nothin'.

31
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,730
Grandpa, what did you get?

32
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,064
Please tell me?

33
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,502
- Edna.
- Hey.

34
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,808
Not until after
you've cleaned up.

35
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,476
Now, hurry, the food's ready.

36
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,645
Oh, Grandpa,
you're kidding with me.

37
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,680
I know you got me something.

38
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,916
Come on.

39
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,155
Thanks!

40
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,325
Lily, not until after supper.
You hear me?

41
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,761
I want you to wash up so you
can help Grandma set the table.

42
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,363
Thomas, not till
after you clean up.

43
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:05,298
You got to set an example.

44
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,601
All right, all right.
I'm goin'.

45
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:15,375
* It's cold tonight 
 down by the river *

46
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:22,450
* The wind is whistlin' 
 thru the pines *

47
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:30,157
* We walked here 
 so many times together *

48
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,829
* I can almost feel 
 your hand in mine *

49
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,373
Guess what I built today?

50
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,808
What did you do?

51
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,410
I built a carpet room
made of moss.

52
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,579
You did?

53
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,913
Mmm hmm.

54
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:55,115
And it felt so good
under my feet.

55
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:59,186
Then, I fell asleep...

56
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,789
And I had that dream again,
you know,

57
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,891
the one about the ocean?

58
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,559
Mmm hmm.

59
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,394
I always wake up
before I see it.

60
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,263
- You do?
- Mmm hmm.

61
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,967
Then I hear that voice
calling my name.

62
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,304
Do you think it was
Daddy's voice?

63
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,440
Well, what do you think?

64
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:23,410
I know it was him -
it had to be.

65
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,114
Tell me about the ocean?

66
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:31,819
Lily, Grandma tells you
this story every single day.

67
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,386
Don't you ever get tired of it?

68
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,222
I know, but I want
to hear it again.

69
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,990
All right, well...
When your daddy was--

70
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,959
Hey!

71
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,529
Hi, sweetie.

72
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,463
How's my little girl?

73
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,698
Good.

74
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,199
Did you have any good
adventures today?

75
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,901
Yes?

76
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,871
Oh!
Not before dinner.

77
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:58,278
Edna...Thomas is spoiling her.

78
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,446
No, he isn't.

79
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,782
It's just a 'weeee'
little bit of candy.

80
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,041
Hello, everybody.

81
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,912
Big day!
Big, big day!

82
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,322
Mmmm, I'm starvin'.

83
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,757
Smells good.

84
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,458
It is good.

85
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,629
Lily, why don't you
come over here

86
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,064
and give your soon-to-be
Daddy a big kiss?

87
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,233
You're not my Daddy yet.

88
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,268
He will be, Lily.

89
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,237
Don't be ugly.

90
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:01,174
Sweetheart...

91
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,544
Dean just wants to be
a good Daddy to ya.

92
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,847
Okay?
That's all.

93
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,583
Now you go apologize.

94
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,621
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,189
Well, now,
that's okay, Pumpkin.

96
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,158
You'll get used to me,

97
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,695
then we'll all be just
one big happy family.

98
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:22,996
Yeah, I hope so.

99
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,840
Thank you.

100
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,374
You're welcome.

101
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,545
Oh, the blessing thing.

102
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,252
Dear Lord,

103
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,755
Bless this food
we are about to receive.

104
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,590
Thank you for the blessings that
you have bestowed upon us.

105
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:51,792
Amen.

106
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,326
Amen.

107
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,402
Ah, ah, Lily.

108
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,205
Just take what you're
gonna eat, Pumpkin.

109
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,846
Did y'all hear
about Copeland Franks?

110
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,516
He spotted that panther,
over there near his cabin.

111
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,818
That stupid Indian.

112
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,419
Why don't he just
kill the damn thing?

113
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,021
That's just like an Indian.

114
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,423
Dean, they'll be no cursin'
at my dinner table.

115
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,360
Sorry, Thomas.
I just can't stand Indians.

116
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:29,697
And as for Copeland Franks -

117
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,631
he's one of the best
trackers I've ever seen.

118
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,267
He is also one of my closest
and dearest friends.

119
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,869
Okay, but--

120
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,171
Grandpa, guess what I built.

121
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,373
Well, let me guess.

122
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,777
Umm, I bet you built a boat.

123
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,478
We need a new boat.

124
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,380
No, Grandpa.

125
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,983
I didn't build a boat.
I made a carpet room.

126
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,119
I put moss all over the ground.

127
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,355
It took me all day,
and I did it down by the creek.

128
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,556
Down by the creek!

129
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,258
Lily, how many times
do you have to be told?

130
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,762
There are snakes down there -
and not to mention that panther.

131
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,864
I haven't seen a snake yet!

132
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,666
And Joey, he won't let
that old panther get me.

133
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,201
Will you, Joey?

134
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,503
Edna, why do you let her go down
to that creek all by herself?

135
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,339
I can't be watching her
every minute.

136
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,407
And you know she
knows those woods,

137
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,909
and she swims like a fish.

138
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:18,011
And Joey isn't going to let
anything happen to her.

139
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,379
I know.
I'm sorry, Edna.

140
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,981
It's just...

141
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,016
I could not stand it
if something happened to her.

142
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,118
Momma, I'm OK.

143
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,555
Hey, is Donna coming tomorrow?

144
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,023
Yeah.
She and Betty

145
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,425
are gonna come
and get some good canning goods.

146
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,661
She's gonna get some
peaches, okra.

147
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,463
She and Donna
gonna be here

148
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,498
first thing in the morning,
bright and early.

149
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,068
I cannot believe I have
to work tomorrow.

150
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,536
You can sell a lot
of cars on the weekend.

151
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,307
I know, but I am supposed to be
planning the wedding reception.

152
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,010
Baby, it can't happen
soon enough for me.

153
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,479
I say we run off
and get married tonight.

154
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,115
What do we need all
this other stuff for?

155
00:11:55,148 --> 00:12:00,620
Because I want to have a church
weddin' with all the trimmin's -

156
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,791
and I want Lily to be there.

157
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,692
I can't wait to see Donna.

158
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,695
I haven't had anyone
to play with in so long.

159
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,400
Grandpa, do you believe that
the creek flows to the ocean?

160
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,602
Yeah, it could.

161
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:19,072
Take the creek a few
miles down to the river.

162
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,508
I reckon it'd take about a week.
Why?

163
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,376
I want to go there so bad.

164
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,880
If I close my eyes I can hear
the sounds of the waves,

165
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,149
and the seagulls.

166
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,051
I can almost smell it.

167
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,120
Does it smell fishy?

168
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,616
Joey, what do you think
it's like at the ocean?

169
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,586
Do you think that Daddy
will know I'm there?

170
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,423
We'll go there someday.

171
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,360
Just you, me and Andrew.

172
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,430
Momma can go too, if she can
get some time off work.

173
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,632
And I don't want her
to bring you-know-who.

174
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,170
Hi, baby.

175
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,471
Hey, Momma.

176
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,039
Here, let me wash your back.

177
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,508
No. I can do it myself.

178
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,310
Oooh...

179
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,413
Gettin' too old for your
Momma to baby you, huh?

180
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:38,085
Honey, it scares me how
fast you are growing up.

181
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,719
Yep.

182
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,388
I'll be grown up
before you know it.

183
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,457
Yeah, but you're always
gonna be my baby girl.

184
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:50,697
Now why don't you get out
before you turn into a prune.

185
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,465
Okay.

186
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,434
Okay.

We're going to
the ocean someday.

190
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,036
Won't that be fun?

191
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:33,573
And I can be
closer to Daddy.

Good night, Andrew.

193
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,817
Hey, Joey, we can show
Donna the carpet room.

194
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,459
Do you think I'm stupid?

195
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,594
Hmm?

00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,563
Do ya?

197
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,900
No, sir.

198
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:11,244
I know one thing.

199
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,748
You lied to me
about that dog.

200
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,222
What did I say was gonna
happen if you lied to me?

201
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,124
Hmm?
What did I say?

I was gonna get a whippin'.

You were gonna
get a whoopin'.

204
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,268
Now, let me ask you.
Did you lie to me?

205
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,372
- Did ya?
- Yes.

206
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,008
You did?

207
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,045
Well...

208
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,680
then we're gonna have
to give you that whoopin'.

209
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:54,654
I hate to have
to do this, Lily.

210
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,490
It's for your own good.

211
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,370
These are critical years
in a young lady's life.

212
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:22,015
Now...I saw you feed
that dog under the table.

213
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,152
And if I ever see that again,

214
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,287
the dog is gone.

215
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,389

216
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,424
That dog is dead!

217

218
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,763
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

219

Yes.

Yes?

Yes.

Yes, Daddy.

Lily?

00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,990
Lily, are you listenin'?

240
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:19,959
Sorry, Grandpa.

241
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,494
That's an oak.

242
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,296
That's good, that's good.

243
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,265

that one over there?

00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,400

All right, smarty pants.

What kind of bird is that

247
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,207
Hawk.

00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,509
Boy, you're gettin'
faster and faster.

249
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,578
Pretty soon you're gonna
be quicker than me.

250
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,613
I won't have anything
left to teach you.

251
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,283
What's the news
on that panther?

252
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,418
I heard her this morning.
She sounded real close.

253
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,119
Yeah, she is.

254
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,656
Them poachers been trappin'
out her food supply.

255
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,824
She'll be going after the
livestock pretty soon -

256
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,227
or even worse.

257
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:57,497
Hey, lookie there.
Ya'll made fire.

258
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,232
Hey, Lily, what do
ya say we ask

259
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,168
Copeland to give us
our new lesson for the day.

260
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,971
We were about to learn how
to tell time from the sun.

261
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,873
Will you be
our teacher today?

262
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,508
I'd be proud to.

263
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,977
Now you lower your arm,

264
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,047
until it's just level
with the horizon.

265
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,049
Now, what time is it?

266
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,551
Six a.m.

267
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,187
- I believe you've got it.
- Grandpa, I got it.

268
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,723
Hey, I knew you
could do that.

269
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,326
Lily, I want to give
you something.

270
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,961
I've had it since
I was your age.

271
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,830
My Grandpa gave it to me.

272
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,432
It's a compass.

273
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:36,068
You can find your way
no matter where you are.

274
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:39,672
Of course, you know what to do
if you're lost and you lose it?

275
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,474
I do.

276
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:44,010
The moss grows on the
north side of the tree.

277
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,546
The sun rises in the east,

278
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,015
and it sets in the west.

279
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:52,652
And I can always locate
the North Star at night.

280
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,723
I'll never lose it.

281
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,893
Now, come on -
let's see if we

282
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,895
remember what y'all
just learned.

Hands to the center
of the sky.

284
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,235
Now lower your arm...

285
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,938
level with the horizon.

286
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,988
Ooh, look at you!

287
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,324
I haven't seen you in weeks.

288
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:33,393
And look how big
you've gotten!

289
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,363
I've grown a lot, Grandma.
Where's Lily?

290
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,166
Well, now she's
off with Grandpa

291
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,402
on their Saturday adventure.

292
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,371
Probably down there in the
woods, which you know

293
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,238
is no place for a little girl.

294
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,874
But you know how
much she loves it.

295
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,442
She can't wait to see you.

296
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,743
I'm gonna call her.

297
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:51,978
Lily!

298
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,613
Thomas!

299
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,482
Company!

300
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,584
I brought those
jars for canning.

301
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:58,918
Good.

302
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,720
I got some more
goodies for ya.

303
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,922
And I got a nice cold
pitcher of sweet tea

304
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,057
waiting for you,
and a hot apple pie

305
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,427
right out of the oven
for you, missy.

306
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,662
Oh, there goes my helper.

307
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,298
Hi, Lily.
How are you?

308
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:22,041
Hey, Thomas, look who's here.

309
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,576
Hi.

310
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,912
Good to see ya, girl.

311
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,180
You're just in time
for planting.

312
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,049
Oh, he's puttin' me
to work already.

313
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,784
Oh, Thomas, behave
yourself now, honey.

314
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,786
She just got here.

315
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,889
Ms. McClain said
tell y'all both hi.

316
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:39,492
Oh, Ms. McClain, she has
a crush on your Daddy.

317
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,327
Oh, no...

318
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,101
Do you know what
Grandpa told me?

319
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,369
No. What?

320
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,971
He says that if I
follow the creek

321
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,573
that I can
get to the ocean.

322
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,408
Do you believe that?

323
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,843
That's hard to believe.

324
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,611
How long would it take
you to get there?

325
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,648
I don't know for sure.
Maybe a week or so.

326
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,450
But I know I'm going.

327
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,753
Oh, Lily, what happened?!

328
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:09,055
Nothing.
I fell.

329
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,190
How did you fall?
That looks awful.

330
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,859
Does it hurt?

331
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,093
It's okay, really.

332
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,996
Please don't tell Momma.
I wouldn't want her to worry.

333
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,899
And besides, she wouldn't let
me come to the creek anymore.

334
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,568
Why don't you tell my Momma?

335
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:25,104
She could help make them better.
You need medicine.

336
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,639
Promise!

337
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:30,710
Okay, I promise.

338
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:45,658
Grandpa, about the ocean -
have you ever seen it?

339
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,994
I have.

340
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:51,030
Is it beautiful
and peaceful there?

341
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,099
It's beautiful.
It's probably one of

342
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,401
the prettiest places
I've ever seen.

343
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,737
Maybe we'll take
you there someday.

344
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,875
About Daddy...

345
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:08,214
Do you think
he'll ever come back?

346
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:12,118
I mean...he got lost
at sea, right?

347
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,587
And I know he was one of

348
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,623
the best sailors
in the United States Navy.

349
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,925
Lily, your Daddy -
he loved the ocean.

350
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,327
He knew all his life
what he wanted to do.

351
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,763
He was happy being a sailor.

352
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,265
I wish we can go today.

353
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,634
I'd never feel hurt...

354
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,636
or afraid of anything.

355
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:32,238
Lily.
Lily!

356
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,360
What you doin', baby?

357
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,700
He was really handsome.

358
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,236
Yeah.

359
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:14,240
You remind me
so much of him.

360
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:18,444
He loved the outdoors, too.

361
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,913
He couldn't kill a thing.

362
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:24,951
Never was a hunter...

363
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:28,287
but he was
a sailor though.

364
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:34,126
He would be
so proud of you.

365
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,764
Do you still miss him?

366
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,199
Yes.

367
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:44,871
And I will always miss him.

368
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:49,341
I loved him more than
anyone ever knew.

369
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,014
He could make me laugh

370
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,917
at the smallest,
silliest things.

371
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,594
But...I have Dean now.

372
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,700
Honey, he just wants to
be a good Daddy to you.

373
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,001
That's my Daddy.

374
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:15,067
That's my only Daddy ever.

375
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,706
Come here, sit up.

376
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,079
Baby...

377
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:31,017
Dean is not trying
to replace William.

378
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,318
Okay?

379
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:36,422
No one can replace William.

380
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,759
No one can replace him
in my heart either.

381
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,830
Just don't make me
call him Daddy.

382
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,940
Tom and Edna,
good night.

383
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:57,076
Now you drive careful,
you hear?

384
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,544
I will.

385
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,112
Mr. Strickland,
good night.

386
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,848
Good night, Dean.

387
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,216
Jenny, you hurry back in.

388
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,755
Thomas, I'm not a little girl.
I know what I am doing.

389
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,222
I know.

390
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,424
But you'll always be
like a daughter to me.

391
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,393
I just want you
to be careful.

392
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,133
Come on, Dad.

393
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,515
Dean.

394
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,717
Dean.

395
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,388
Oh, what happened?

396
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,899
When I look
into your eyes...

397
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,870
Never mind.

398
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,196
Mmm, that's mine.

399
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:31,103
I have to go.

400
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,872
I have to go, too.

401
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:33,165
Not much longer.

402
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,968
I can't wait much longer.

403
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,329
Where are you, Lily?

404
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:28,280
* Is she lonesome now? *

405
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:30,716
* Is she all alone? *

406
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:36,088
* I wonder where 
 that good gal's gone *

407
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,090
* Hear the whistle blow *

408
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,526
* Hear the tracks moan *

409
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,397
* I hear that train 
 comin' home *

410
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:48,134
* Lonesome is the name *

411
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,469
* Of the northbound train *

412
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:55,541
* The hills are green 
 where she's gone *

413
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:57,476
* She made up her mind *

414
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,646
* To leave sorrow behind *

415
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,084
* On her way back home *

416
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:09,321
* There is a place *

417
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:16,895
* Where her shining face 
 still smiles *

418
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,249
* Does she sing 
 a glad song *

419
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:39,685
* Or is she sad I'm gone? *

420
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:44,623
* I hear her voice 
 laugh in a dream *

421
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,593
* How near she seemed *

422
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:54,700
* When she whispered 
 her sad farewell *

423
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:27,399
You know, Joey, it's not far
'til we make it to the river.

424
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:31,203
We'll be there in no time.

425
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:40,479
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

426
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,951
My Bonnie lies over the sea

427
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:50,989
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

428
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,960
Bring my Bonnie back to me

429
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:20,586
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

430
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,190
My Bonnie lies over the sea

431
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:28,227
My Bonnie lies over the ocean

432
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,231
So bring back
my Bonnie to me

433
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:36,134
To me, to me...

434
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:41,673
Did I hear some sweet bird
singin' in the mornin' light?

435
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:45,777
Oh, he's a charmer.

436
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,547
Always smells good
in this kitchen.

437
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,848
Sure does.

438
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,917
How did you
sleep last night?

439
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,654
That's all I get is
one little peck on the cheek?

440
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,892
I sure did miss
my baby last night.

441
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,728
I missed you, too.

442
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,896
I missed you bad.

443
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,334
Thomas!
Lily!

444
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,935
Breakfast!

445
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,470
Y'all sit down now.

446
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,671
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,873
We got orange juice,
or you can have tomato juice.

448
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,208
Uh, orange, please.

449
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,376
Okay.

450
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,077
- Orange?
- Yes.

451
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,847
Well, you're already back?
I thought you just left.

452
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,283
Thomas, where's Lily?

453
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,117
Uh, I didn't see
her this morning.

454
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,086
I figured she was
sleepin' in.

455
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,457
Well...
Okay.

456
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:37,396
Lily!
Get down here this instant!

457
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,698
She is probably down there
by that creek again.

458
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,700
I'll go get her.

459
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,237
I'll go get her.

460
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,045
I got some uh, eggs -
cheese in 'em for you.

461
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,113
Thank you.

462
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,716
I do not know what
it is gonna take.

463
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,952
She just won't
mind me anymore.

464
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:03,088
I'm tellin' ya.
You gotta be stern with her.

465
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,057
All she needs is some good
old-fashioned discipline.

466
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,193
That's the way
my dad handled it.

467
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,095
We all knew better.

468
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,799
God, he used to
beat us silly.

469
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:16,368
And if we kept at it, things
started disappearing...

470
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:18,570
our toys, our pets.

471
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:22,608
My dog, one morning - gone.

472
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,910
What do you mean,
disappearing?

473
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,845
I mean that was
the last time I saw 'em.

474
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,013
He just disappeared.

475
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,449
Oh, you know, we knew
he shot 'em--

476
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:32,551
Enough!

477
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,886
I do not want
to hear any more.

478
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,154
What?

479
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,057
How cruel, Dean.

480
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,530
And you call that discipline?

481
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,607
What did I say?

482
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:19,297
* Some day I will drift away *

483
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:23,902
* Down the rivers 
 and the streams *

484
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,738
* And when I find the ocean *

485
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:29,608
* I'll be home *

486
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,016
[panther roars in distance]

487
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,854
Did you hear that, boy?

488
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,894
We have nothin'
to worry about.

489
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,999
She can't get us over here.

490
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,572
Cats are afraid of water.

491
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,142
Lily!

492
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:20,125
I can feed you
anytime I want...

493
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,128
and nobody
would care.

494
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,586
Dear Momma...

495
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,354
I don't want you to worry.

496
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,156
I love you so much.

497
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,625
I am very sorry that I have 
 been a burden lately.

498
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:56,361
I want to see the ocean.

499
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,064
I want to see 
 what Daddy saw.

500
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:02,333
I just want to be close 
 to my Daddy now,

501
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,170
and I'm for sure that 
 nothing can hurt me there.

502
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,806
Hurt me there?

503
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,980
I am glad 
 to see you so happy,

504
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,616
but I think 
 it's better this way.

505
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,554
I will send you...

506
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,690
a postcard soon.

507
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,059
Promise.

508
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:29,861
I love you.

509
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,530
Lily.

510
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,069
She's gone.

511
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,971
We know.
The boat's missin'.

512
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:42,641
I mean...she's gone.

513
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,276
She's...she's run away.

514
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,278
You don't really think
that she would try

515
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,214
to get to the ocean, do you?

516
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,116
I mean, can she do that?

517
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:52,117
What does she mean,

518
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,752
'no one will hurt her there?'

519
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,121
Hurt her?
Daddy?

520
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,990
I would never hurt her...

521
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:02,861
and I would never let
anybody else hurt her.

522
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,996
Edna, call the sheriff.

523
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,734
I will.
Let's go.

524
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,435
Let's go call him, honey.

525
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,741
I'll call him, I'll call him.

526
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,549
Oh, hurry, 
please, Henry.

527
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,183
Thank you.

528
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,421
Whoa!
What's with the gun?

529
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,924
It's only precautionary.
Are you comin'?

530
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:35,861
Uh...yeah.

531
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,563
Everything's gonna
be fine, Jenny.

532
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,664
I called Copeland.

533
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,699
He's gonna meet me
at the creek with his boat.

534
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,200
Okay.

535
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,063
C'mon, Sooner.

536
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:47,265
How long does it take
to set a trap?

537
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,734
How long?

538
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,902
Till I get done.

539
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,556
We are going south.

540
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,159
That's the right direction.

541
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,527
I wonder what time it is?

542
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,007
It's about eight o'clock.

543
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,441
I can do it, Joey.

544
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:32,543
I can tell time
by the sun.

545
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,653
We better go get some
more water before we go.

546
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,356
Hey, McGee!
There's a snake.

547
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,191
Where? Where?

548
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:21,860
This'n right here.

549
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,628
Damn it, Adams,
don't you start with me.

550
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,663
This is serious.
A little girl's missing.

551
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:26,998
I know.

552
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:29,134
Gosh, why you gotta be
so hard-nosed all the time?

553
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,335
Just messin' with ya.

554
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,673
Wait up, Joey!

555
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,709
Oww!!

556
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:43,849
Go get the stick.

557
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,434
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:13,144
You hear that panther
growlin' this mornin'?

559
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,046
Yep, sure did.

560
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,115
You know, we gettin'
closer every day.

561
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:20,085
I hope we git him soon.

562
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:22,553
His hide would bring
a purdy penny.

563
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:24,389
It sure would.

564
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,724
But after tonight
we're gonna have to lay off

565
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,493
this trappin' for a while.

566
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:33,398
I got a bad feelin' that this
sheriff is close to our scent.

567
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,067
Yeah, he probably is.

568
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,715
[panther roars]

569
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,050
Did you hear that?

570
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,351
Sure did.

571
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:55,320
Sounds like
she's gettin' close.

572
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,356
C'mon.

573
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,329
This is where she went in.

574
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:06,464
She probably didn't use
the motor at first.

575
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,366
It's pretty shallow up here.

576
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,002
Yeah, she doesn't have
a lot of gasoline.

577
00:46:11,036 --> 00:46:12,637
I figure she'll wait
'til she hits the river

578
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:13,939
to use the motor.

579
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,673
When do you think
she hit the river?

580
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,508
Knowing Lily, I'd say
early this mornin'.

581
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,277
She's quick and she knows
her way around the water.

582
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,879
She got a big jump on us.

583
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:22,747
Just tell me what you
want me to do, Thomas.

584
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,449
That little girl is
special to all of us.

585
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:25,716
Thanks, Reverend.

586
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,252
We're gonna need
everyone on this -

587
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,354
especially the good Lord.

588
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,522
Would you do me a favor
and keep an eye on Edna?

589
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,224
I don't want her here
worrying by herself.

590
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:35,861
All right, but you call us
as soon as you find her.

591
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:38,329
Now, before we set out
on this important mission,

592
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:40,631
could we all say a prayer?

593
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:42,500
Bow your heads, please.

594
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,671
Thank you, Lord,
for being with Lily today.

595
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,840
Thank you for being with us.

596
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:51,409
Bless the Strickland family
for the safe return

597
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:53,478
of their grandchild.

598
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,613
Cradle her in your safe arms

599
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,516
so Jenny can cradle
her again in hers.

600
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,952
Guide us swiftly and directly.

601
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,720
In Jesus' Name.

602
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,289
Amen.

603
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,092
All right, Adams,
take some of these men,

604
00:47:07,125 --> 00:47:09,660
get a couple dogs,
cover that side of the creek.

605
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:13,198
McGee, you get some men,
you scout this side.

606
00:47:19,871 --> 00:47:22,140
I'm going up to the
house to check on Edna.

607
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,375
Jenny, she'll be all right.
Have faith.

608
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,377
Thank you, Reverend.

609
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:35,520
Sheriff, Copeland!
You better come quick!

610
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:39,024
What you got, Tim?

611
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,692
Oh, Lord.

612
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:44,963
These tracks are fresh -
about a half a day old.

613
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:46,965
Big one, too.

614
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:48,934
And she's headed downstream.

615
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:52,770
I can't lose her, too.

616
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,406
I just can't.

617
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:00,145
She is everything to me.

618
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:06,217
Oh, baby...

619
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,188
It's okay.
We'll find her.

620
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:49,927
Well, lookie there what we
done caught in the trap, son!

621
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:52,998
I guess I done
won that bet.

622
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:55,066
I guess you did.

623
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,502
Look at that pretty
golden hair.

624
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,242
Look at her leg, Emmit.

625
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,677
She's hurt bad.

626
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,546
What we gonna do with her?

627
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,448
She'll get us in some
real trouble for sure.

628
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,017
You shut up!

629
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,486
Well, now, little girl...

630
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,823
looks like we got ourselves
a real problem here.

631
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:20,325
Help me.
Please.

632
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:22,093
No, no.
Now listen up.

633
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,861
I mean, we could let you go,

634
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,432
but then you'd be in
on our little secret.

635
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,801
Now, if you stay with us,
probably come in kinda handy.

636
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,370
And we could learn
you somethin'.

637
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:35,240
This your rabbit, little girl?

638
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,708
He sure is fat.

639
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:41,646
Make a good stew, he will.

640
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,015
No!
No, please...he's a pet.

641
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:46,451
He's not a wild one.
Don't hurt him.

642
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,153
I promise
I won't say anything.

643
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,387
Is that your dog?

644
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,122
Hey, boy.

645
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,958
Aagh, he tried nippin' at me.

646
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,527
Sooner, kill that dog.

647
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:57,862
- All right.
- Kill 'em!

648
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,131
I guess we're gonna have to
teach you some manners.

649
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,699
No!

650
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,568
[gun fires]

651
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,622
Put the gun down.

652
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,399
You too.

653
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:37,135
Don't even think about
that knife in your boot.

654
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,905
Now you guys
get out of here.

655
00:50:40,938 --> 00:50:42,707
My rabbit!

656
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,476
Let the rabbit go.

657
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:48,846
Hey, we just found her here.

658
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,315
We was just tryin'
to help.

659
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:51,582
Ain't that right, Sooner?

660
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:52,983
Yeah, sure.

661
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:54,685
Ya'll just get on
away from here...

662
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,421
before I lose my temper.

663
00:51:00,225 --> 00:51:01,926
Go on!

664
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,571
Okay.
Whoa!

665
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,140
You're hurt pretty bad.

666
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:17,242
I'm gonna take it off.
It's gonna hurt you.

667
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:18,543
Hold on.

668
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,379
Okay.

669
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,913
I want you to
stand up for me.

670
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,149
Can you try that?

671
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:25,783
Come on.
You're a big girl.

672
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,485
You can do it.
Stand up.

673
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,320
Good girl, good girl.

674
00:51:29,354 --> 00:51:30,955
Let's try to walk.

675
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,558
What's your doggie's name?

676
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,526
- Joey.
- C'mon Joey.

677
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,656
We got to get us
some shotgun shells.

678
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,326
And we need us a couple
new guns, too - remember?

679
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,561
Of course I remember, you idiot.

680
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,532
Have you heard anything else
about Lily Strickland?

681
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:15,966
No, not this afternoon.

682
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,968
All the town men are
out looking for her.

683
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:20,471
You know the panther was heard
over by their house last night.

684
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:23,274
Oh, Lord.
What's gonna happen to her?

685
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:26,577
I can't imagine a little
girl lost in those woods.

686
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:29,714
I just don't know what else
that family can handle.

687
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:32,417
They lost a son
a few years ago.

688
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,853
He was a fine boy.
He was in the Navy.

689
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:39,924
It just took forever
for Jenny to get over that.

690
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:42,260
What she must
be going through.

691
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,663
You know, those poachers been
settin' up traps everywhere.

692
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:48,032
That's why that cat
is so close in.

693
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:50,501
What if she gets
in the trap first?

694
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:53,304
Well, the panther really
will get to her.

695
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:56,541
Lordy mercy.
What's this world comin' to?

696
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,778
Well, I've been prayin'
for Jenny and her daughter.

697
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:03,281
They've had
such a hard life.

698
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,519
I better be goin'.

699
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,688
If y'all hear anything
will you let me know?

700
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:13,691
Sure thing.
Thanks.

701
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,429
- Howdy.
- How are you boys?

702
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,865
Did I hear you say that
somebody was missin'?

703
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,633
Thomas Strickland's
granddaughter.

704
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,602
- No!
- Yeah.

705
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,006
Well, who all they
got lookin' for her?

706
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,675
The sheriff got
a search party together.

707
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,243
They're meetin' up
down at the mouth

708
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:35,480
of the river, I think.
You boys wanna help?

709
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,914
Well, sure we do.

710
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,215
- Don't we, Sooner?
- Sure.

711
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:40,351
I'd hate for anything
to happen to that little girl.

712
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:44,221
Of course, we're gonna
need a couple of rifles...

713
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:46,957
Uh, that shotgun and that
one with the scope on it.

714
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:50,060
Seein's how both our guns
were stolen just today.

715
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:52,029
- Stolen?!
- Yes, ma'am.

716
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,364
What in the world?

717
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:54,565
Well, I tell you -

718
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,367
things just aren't safe
anywhere anymore.

719
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:57,802
That first rifle,

720
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,337
and that shotgun
next to it.

721
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,638
Sure thing.

722
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:02,507
Thank ya.

723
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,476
What else for you boys?

724
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:09,079
How 'bout two boxes
of .00 buck for this,

725
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:11,449
and a 30.06 for that one.

726
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,883
Okay.

727
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,553
Oh, yeah.

728
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,789
I'm sorry, ma'am,
where did you say

729
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:21,526
that sheriff was meetin' up
with that search party?

730
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,395
I think they'll be meetin' up
at the mouth of the river.

731
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,897
We'll see what we can do.

732
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,699
Yeah, we'll see what we can do.

733
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,502
All right, boys,
we're camping here.

734
00:54:31,536 --> 00:54:32,703
No.
Wait.

735
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:34,539
We have to keep going.
What if she's hurt?

736
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:36,273
Lily wouldn't do
anything to jeopardize

737
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:37,775
that dog or the rabbit.

738
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:39,777
She knows how to
survive off the land.

739
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:41,278
She knows how
to stay out of sight.

740
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,980
We ain't gonna find
her tonight, honey.

741
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:46,417
Do you think she's all right?
I mean, what if she's scared?

742
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:48,252
Jenny, she's a brave
little girl -

743
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,520
just like you were.

744
00:54:49,554 --> 00:54:51,456
The way her father was.

745
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:52,857
Come on.
Let's get some rest.

746
00:54:58,496 --> 00:55:00,097
We're camping here?

747
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,999
All night?

748
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,555
[panther roars]

749
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:04,922
(Sheriff)
Here we are, right here.

750
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:08,025
I feel that Lily is no
farther than here.

751
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:10,628
Hopefully, she rested
in this radius right here.

752
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:13,230
If we spread out, there's no way
we're gonna miss her.

753
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:16,767
Yeah, but if I know Lily,
she left before sunrise.

754
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:18,469
She wouldn't let
night cover stop her.

755
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:20,404
She knows where
she is by the stars.

756
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,107
I'm afraid she got more of
a lead on us than you think.

757
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,775
Yeah, maybe you're right.

758
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,711
But we've got
men and dogs

759
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,713
on both sides
of the creek.

760
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:31,048
We got ten boats
in the water.

761
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,017
We've radioed the ports...

762
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,352
and it's on the news.

763
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:36,721
I don't think
there's any way

764
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:38,889
that we won't find
her sometime today.

765
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,457
Maybe we can put
a stop to all this

766
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:42,359
crazy behavior
once and for all.

767
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,195
I am about an inch away from--

768
00:57:45,229 --> 00:57:46,597
I don't know what it
is that you think

769
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,098
you're gonna
teach her, Dean.

770
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,367
Well, how about
not to run off?

771
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,436
Maybe she
ran away from you.

772
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,071
You got something
to say about that?

773
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:56,173
Look, I don't know
what you're saying--

774
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,008
Thomas, he's just
trying to help.

775
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,545
Dean would
never hurt Lily,

776
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:03,213
and you know that.
You're just tired.

777
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,882
Hey, Sheriff, could I talk
to you a minute?

778
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:06,250
It's okay.

779
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:07,685
Y'all excuse me
for a minute.

780
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,387
Thomas.

781
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,843
Well, that's when
we seen her.

782
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:34,679
That little blond girl
was puttin' up a fuss -

783
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:36,681
kickin' trying to git
away from that man.

784
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,115
And we went to shoot at him

785
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:40,417
and that colored
done shot at us first.

786
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,119
What do you mean
he shot first?

787
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:44,354
He shot at us, told us
not to come no closer.

788
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:46,957
Then he told us
to put our guns down.

789
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:48,492
We didn't wanna do that,

790
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,960
and then he shot at us again.

791
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,328
What did he do with Lily?

792
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,131
Mr. Strickland,
we don't know.

793
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,967
He made us run off...
and he kept our guns.

794
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,569
You should've heard that
little girl screamin' -

795
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:00,204
I mean, all the way
up the hill.

796
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:01,772
Who was he?
Do you know him?

797
00:59:01,806 --> 00:59:06,510
He's that tugboat captain,
Amos Jackson.

798
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,312
Amos Jackson?

799
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,748
I know Amos Jackson.
He wouldn't hurt nobody.

800
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,416
Ya'll sure you got
the right man?

801
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,984
Yes, sir.

802
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:16,553
What would Amos Jackson
want with my granddaughter?

803
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,324
You know what they say, sir.

804
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:22,359
No.
What do they say?

805
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,428
About them coloreds...

806
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:26,797
the way they like them
little white girls.

807
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,601
Stop it!

808
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:32,002
Stop it now!

809
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,470
Watch your
temper, Grandpa,

810
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,739
before you get hurt!

811
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:36,006
You watch your mouth, boy!

812
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,642
I don't know
what's going on here,

813
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:39,977
but it's the only lead we got.

814
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,545
Now we're gonna
find Amos Jackson.

815
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,013
We're gonna get some answers.

816
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,049
I'm sure there's an
explanation for all of this.

817
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,517
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

818
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:48,552
Thomas!

819
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,755
Not now, Thomas.
We're wastin' time.

820
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:53,891
Thomas, come on.

821
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:57,361
Now you boys need to go on
and get out of here.

822
00:59:57,394 --> 01:00:00,230
There's been a lot of poachin'
goin' on around here.

823
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:03,267
Sure would hate to think you
boys knew anything about that.

824
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,002
How 'bout you, Sooner?

825
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,938
I don't know nuthin' about
no poachin', Sheriff.

826
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:10,040
We just tryin'
to help is all.

827
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:11,909
We just heard about that
little girl missin'

828
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,043
up at Bertie's Store.

829
01:00:13,077 --> 01:00:15,713
She told us we might could
find y'all down here.

830
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,149
Y'all just go on,
get on out of here.

831
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:20,985
We'll take it from here.

832
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:27,091
Diggin' for ginseng -

833
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,993
I don't believe that
for one minute.

834
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,842
How long?

835
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,311
Yesterday afternoon, maybe.

836
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:50,080
Three, maybe four o'clock.

837
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,729
Wow, is this it?
Is this your boat?

838
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:06,163
Yeah.

839
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:08,198
That's the Anna Marie.

840
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:11,902
Take your time.

841
01:01:11,936 --> 01:01:13,971
Your ankle hurt?

842
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,574
Come on down,
watch your step.

843
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:20,911
Robert, Henry!
This is Lily.

844
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:22,546
Hi, Lily.

845
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:28,753
Joey!
Come on, boy!

846
01:01:30,087 --> 01:01:32,122
Joey, what's the matter?

847
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:33,590
What do you see, boy?

848
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:35,059
Joey, come on.

849
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:42,900
Joey, c'mon now.

850
01:01:43,467 --> 01:01:45,870
Lily, don't move.
Be still.

851
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,040
Now, boy!
C'mon!

852
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:02,753
Henry, cut us loose!

853
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:07,624
Robert!

854
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:22,172
Man, y'all should've
been there.

855
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:24,141
I mean we tried to stop him,

856
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,243
but he dang near
killed both of us!

857
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,545
Yeah, but he missed.

858
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,148
No joke he missed, numb nut.

859
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,283
That's why we sittin' here
talkin' 'bout it today.

860
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:35,319
Yeah, but he really was mad.

861
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,553
Oh, yeah.

862
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,055
You know, he took
that little girl's

863
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,957
big ole black rabbit
and her yellow dog.

864
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,726
What did he want
with that little girl, anyway?

865
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,562
Ain't quite for sure
on that one.

866
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,131
Dadburn it, Emmit.

867
01:02:47,164 --> 01:02:49,967
What'd you think a big black man
want with a little white girl?

868
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,169
Do I have to
spell it out for you?

869
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,904
Aw, no.
Darn!

870
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:56,240
Well, we're gonna do
somethin' about this boys.

871
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,687
I think the Sheriff...

872
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,489
he didn't even believe us,

873
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:15,592
'cause he and Amos,
they've been friends, anyhow.

874
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,962
We probably gone have to
have some kind of proof.

875
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,596
Proof!

876
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,033
We'll show him proof!

877
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,668
Proof nothin'.

878
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:26,203
Boys, we got a job to do.

879
01:03:27,872 --> 01:03:30,140
Wooo!

880
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,247
Whoo, ha!

881
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:38,949
Hell, yeah.

882
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,591
We gonna teach
that colored

883
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:50,327
not to mess
with us Johnson boys.

884
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,462
That little girl
is big trouble.

885
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:55,199
But now...

886
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:59,103
we gonna take care of both
'em at the same dang time.

887
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:00,737
Yeah, we'll show 'em.

888
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,306
We'll show 'em.

889
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:05,509
What are we gonna do, Emmit?

890
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,644
Well, nothin' just yet.

891
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,813
You just sit back
and relax, son.

892
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,615
You'll see.

893
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,090
Hey, Sheriff...
I found this.

894
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,227
Oh, man.

895
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,335
Those are Lily's pants.

896
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,904
There's blood on them!

897
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:36,340
Now, Jenny, Jenny.
Don't lose control.

898
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,542
There was blood
in the trap, too.

899
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,577
Maybe there's another
explanation for all of this.

900
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,279
I just don't know what
to think anymore.

901
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:44,014
I just...

902
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:45,916
I just want her back.

903
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:52,589
Oh, my.

904
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,059
What do you make
of that, Copeland?

905
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:57,661
The panther was here
a couple hours ago.

906
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:00,464
It looks like Lily's dog,
Joey, was here, too.

907
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:02,632
The cat tracks come
out right over here,

908
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,901
and the rest of 'em
go down on the dock.

909
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:08,105
Probably on Amos'
tugboat right now.

910
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:10,975
The next stop down river
would be Peabody Docks.

911
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:14,178
I'm gonna stay behind y'all.
That cat's close.

912
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,213
It's probably watching
us right now.

913
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,382
I'll catch up to y'all later.

914
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,750
Do you want some
men to go with you?

915
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:23,053
I reckon I could
use some help.

916
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:27,958
All right, McGee, Adam...
Come on, go with Copeland.

917
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:30,127
We'll catch up with you
down at Peabody Docks.

918
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,965
All right, men, we're gonna
get goin' in just a minute.

919
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,800
We gotta head down river.

920
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,557
Everything was so good.

921
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:09,726
I'm so glad y'all
enjoyed everything.

922
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:12,962
Here you go.

923
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:15,199
Now would you like
a piece of pie?

924
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:17,334
Would you like
peach or apple?

925
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,203
I would like peach, please.

926
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:21,105
Peach.
All right, sweetie.

927
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:22,672
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

928
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,309
- See ya later, Gina.
- Y'all come back.

929
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:44,994
Amos, why is
everybody staring?

930
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:47,197
Hi, Amos.
How are you?

931
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:48,432
Hi, Gina.
How are you?

932
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:49,666
I'm doing fine.

933
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:51,335
And who is this
we have with us?

934
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:54,138
This is our new
tugboat captain.

935
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:56,306
Well, y'all let me know
if you need anything.

936
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,508
Sure.
I appreciate it.

937
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:04,281
Amos, you didn't
answer my question...

938
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:06,416
Why's everybody staring?

939
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:14,524
Lily, it's just
the way things are.

940
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,360
What do you mean?

941
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:22,332
People are scared.

942
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:24,301
Scared of what?

943
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:29,473
Themselves, uh...change.

944
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:31,741
They're scared of change.

945
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,067
Well, Jesse?

946
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,969
Well, you're all
set to go, Amos.

947
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,371
Next stop, Selma.

948
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,006
Next stop, Selma.

949
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,849
Somethin' on your mind, Jesse?

950
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:15,151
Can I speak to you
in private for a minute?

951
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,622
About what?

952
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,758
Lily, I want to talk to Jesse
for a moment in private,

953
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,993
if you don't mind.
And when I get through

954
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:27,197
we gonna head on
down to Selma.

955
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:29,032
Aye Aye, Captain.

956
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:30,800
Thanks for the biscuits, Jesse.

957
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,302
They're the best in Alabama.

958
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:34,438
You're welcome, Lily.
You come back and see me.

959
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,275
I've known you
a long time, Jesse.

960
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:39,709
Is that correct?

961
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,445
I know that look.
What is it?

962
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:43,012
Look, there ain't nothin'
wrong right now, but listen.

963
01:09:43,046 --> 01:09:44,681
Everybody 'round
here is talkin'

964
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:46,850
about that little
white girl you got with you.

965
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:49,419
What do you mean with me?

966
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:51,788
You mean a black man?

967
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,290
Or should I say a nigger?

968
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:55,158
Oh, come on now, Amos.
You know me better than that.

969
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,360
I ain't like that.

970
01:09:56,393 --> 01:09:58,395
But what is she
doing with you?

971
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,367
Why you talk
like that to me?

972
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,702
Does she look
scared to you?

973
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:08,071
Do you think I'd hurt her?

974
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:10,840
Jesse, I found her
in the woods -

975
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:14,511
hurt, by herself.

976
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,746
She was caught in a poacher's
trap on her ankle.

977
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,415
She couldn't walk.

978
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,949
And them two idiots
messin' around with her -

979
01:10:19,983 --> 01:10:21,785
I had to run 'em off.

980
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:23,420
So I took her home with me.

981
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,722
She's gotta have some relatives
around here somewhere.

982
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,457
Well, I reckon so.
What kind of family is that?

983
01:10:27,491 --> 01:10:28,758
Somebody been
beatin' on her.

984
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:31,160
I'm tellin' ya,
somethin's wrong.

985
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:32,929
All right, I understand.

986
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,165
But not everybody around here
thinks like you and me.

987
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:37,601
Oh?
How is that?

988
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:39,068
I just don't want to see
you lose everything

989
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:40,904
you've worked
your whole life for.

990
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:43,039
Really?

991
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:50,213
All right, Jesse.
I appreciate that.

992
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,550
I thank ya, sir.
I'll just watch my back.

993
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,184
Okay?

994
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:07,397
Hello!

995
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:15,004
Hey.
Hi, honey.

996
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:17,574
Have you heard
anything yet?

997
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:35,559
I...I'm just worried sick.

998
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:37,827
I don't know what
would cause her

999
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,730
to do something like this.

1000
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:47,504
I think I know.

1001
01:11:47,537 --> 01:11:49,305
What?

1002
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:52,776
If you know something,
you need to tell us.

1003
01:11:54,578 --> 01:11:56,546
Donna?

1004
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,397
* People get ready *

1005
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:17,066
* There's a train a-comin' *

1006
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:20,003
* You dont need 
 no baggage *

1007
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:23,907
* You just get on board *

1008
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,510
* All you need is faith *

1009
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:30,346
* Hear the diesels 
 hummin' *

1010
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,116
* Don't need no ticket *

1011
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:37,120
* You just thank the Lord *

1012
01:12:37,153 --> 01:12:39,623
* People get ready *

1013
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:43,326
* There's a train to Jordan *

1014
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,095
* Pickin' up passengers *

1015
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:50,166
* From coast to coast *

1016
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,736
* Faith is the key *

1017
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:56,540
* To open the doors 
 and board them *

1018
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,908
* There's hope for all *

1019
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:03,312
* Among those 
 who love the most *

1020
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:06,215
* So people get ready *

1021
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:09,853
* There's a train a-comin *

1022
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,689
* You dont need no baggage *

1023
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:16,693
* You just get on board *

1024
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,463
* Dont need no ticket *

1025
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:23,867
* You just thank the Lord *

1026
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:39,082
Amos, where is your family?

1027
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,717
Don't you have one?

1028
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:46,155
Well, yeah.
I did have a family.

1029
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,793
Did you have kids?

1030
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:53,029
Yes, I did.

1031
01:13:53,062 --> 01:13:55,198
Where are they now?

1032
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:02,238
They're in heaven.

1033
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,073
How'd they die?

1034
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:11,481
Well, Anna was about your age.

1035
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:14,518
And I was working
at the docks.

1036
01:14:14,551 --> 01:14:18,054
Marie was home with Anna
and somethin' happened.

1037
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,884
No...

1038
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:52,488
No!

1039
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:57,727
No, no, no!

1040
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,302
Did they make it out?

1041
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,340
No.

1042
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:33,529
Did you think the color
would rub off?

1043
01:15:34,698 --> 01:15:36,232
Grandma says,

1044
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,267
we're all the same
on the inside.

1045
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:40,704
God just took
a big paintbrush

1046
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:43,873
and painted us all
different on the outside.

1047
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:48,211
I just thought it would
have been watercolors.

1048
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:55,318
C'mon, Emmit.
It's gettin' dark.

1049
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,353
I don't know what
it is, but somethin'--

1050
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,956
somethin' just
don't feel right.

1051
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:03,993
You just got the jitters 'cause
of that little Strickland girl.

1052
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,929
We ain't gonna
git caught, son.

1053
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,598
Once the clan catches up
with that dang tugboat,

1054
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:11,400
that little girl'll be too
scared to tell nobody 'bout us.

1055
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:13,102
Did you hear that?

1056
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:14,771
There's somethin' out there.

1057
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:16,172
Sooner, you're hearin' things.

1058
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:17,506
Now stop it.

1059
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,776
And don't go shootin' off
that gun neither.

1060
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,410
You'll have the whole
search party on us,

1061
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:23,546
quicker 'an bees
on a hive.

1062
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:27,183
[panther growling]

1063
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:33,790
Don't move a muscle, boys.

1064
01:16:33,823 --> 01:16:36,125
She's right there
in front of ya.

1065
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:47,937
Drop the guns, boys.

1066
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:49,673
It's all over.
We heard everything.

1067
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:53,476
We didn't mean
to hurt nobody.

1068
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,844
Would you shut up, idiot?

1069
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:56,379
Huh?

1070
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:59,015
Yeah, but you did.

1071
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:00,650
And now you've got
a whole county

1072
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:02,385
after an innocent man.

1073
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:03,687
Let's go.

1074
01:17:07,657 --> 01:17:09,893
You're lucky we were here.

1075
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:12,095
Y'all would have ended up
as her dinner tonight.

1076
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,853
God's paintbrush.

1077
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,291
Nathan!

1078
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,659
Be still, Lily.

1079
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,194
Look after Lily.

1080
01:17:49,933 --> 01:17:52,702
Amos Jackson.
Stop the boat!

1081
01:17:52,736 --> 01:17:54,270
What do y'all want?

1082
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,272
We know you've got that
little Strickland girl on there.

1083
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:57,707
Now pull aside!

1084
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,110
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1085
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:02,879
Stop that boat, Amos,

1086
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:05,114
or we're gonna
count you guilty.

1087
01:18:05,148 --> 01:18:07,516
Guilty of what?

1088
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,787
Look, I gotta make a delivery.

1089
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,224
You want to talk to me,
I'll be in Selma first light.

1090
01:18:15,258 --> 01:18:16,793
We gave you fair warnin'.

1091
01:18:16,826 --> 01:18:18,828
Next time it ain't
gonna be so easy.

1092
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:20,663
Y'all better find some
business of your own.

1093
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,565
Now the river gets
narrow up ahead.

1094
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,533
You want to talk to me,
like I said -

1095
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:26,369
I'll be in Selma.

1096
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,104
Now get on outta here.

1097
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:30,807
You ain't seen the last
of us, Amos Jackson!

1098
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,552
Are you all right, Lily?

1099
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,254
Yeah. Are you?

1100
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:47,623
Who were those men?

1101
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:50,293
Those men won't bother
us anymore tonight.

1102
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,328
Those small boats
can't stay in our wake,

1103
01:18:52,361 --> 01:18:54,230
so it's not a problem.

1104
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:57,566
Why don't you
get some sleep?

1105
01:18:58,201 --> 01:18:59,936
When do you sleep?

1106
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:02,972
I'll sleep tomorrow.

1107
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:05,441
Nathan, get some shut eye, okay?

1108
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,310
- You sure, boss?
- I'm sure.

1109
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,452
Good night, Amos.

1110
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:17,753
I love you.

1111
01:19:21,024 --> 01:19:22,926
I love you too, Lily.

1112
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:37,173
Jesse, I know Amos is
a good friend of yours,

1113
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:39,208
but I just gotta find
my granddaughter.

1114
01:19:39,242 --> 01:19:41,210
I don't know if I should
tell you anything.

1115
01:19:41,244 --> 01:19:43,212
I don't know that you
have a choice, Jesse.

1116
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:45,681
You see that
woman over there?

1117
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,350
She's terrified.

1118
01:19:47,383 --> 01:19:49,618
She doesn't know
Amos Jackson like we do.

1119
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:51,220
She doesn't know
what he wants

1120
01:19:51,254 --> 01:19:53,122
with her little girl, either.

1121
01:19:53,156 --> 01:19:55,024
Look, Sheriff, I don't want
no trouble here.

1122
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:56,826
That little girl's been abused.

1123
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,127
What do you mean?

1124
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:00,163
Amos found her in a trap
over in the forest.

1125
01:20:00,196 --> 01:20:02,031
He saved her life.

1126
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,301
Why didn't he
bring her home?

1127
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,370
Somebody beat her.

1128
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:09,172
That little girl ain't
never had a spankin',

1129
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:10,874
much less a beatin'!

1130
01:20:11,274 --> 01:20:14,377
Jenny, here's your coffee.

1131
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:18,281
You all right, Thomas?

1132
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,382
You son of a--

1133
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:21,617
What!
Thomas, don't!

1134
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,152
Get up.
Get up and hit a man.

1135
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:25,154
You good for nothin'--

1136
01:20:25,188 --> 01:20:27,290
A man?
You sucker-punched me.

1137
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,325
Thomas!
What has gotten into you?

1138
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:30,793
Ask him!

1139
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,128
He knows what
I'm talkin' about.

1140
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,162
What?!

1141
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:34,998
How could you hurt her?
What did she ever do to you?

1142
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:36,599
It was him.

1143
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,401
He beat her, and she
never said a word!

1144
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,169
What are you talkin'--

1145
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:41,837
Dean, what is he
talkin' about?

1146
01:20:41,871 --> 01:20:43,072
He's a crazy old man.

1147
01:20:43,106 --> 01:20:44,440
Dean?

1148
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,943
Lily?

1149
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,088
No one
can hurt her.

1150
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:03,326
Oh, my God...

1151
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:09,232
What did you
do to her?

1152
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:10,599
What?

1153
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,537
You bastard!

1154
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:16,305
What did you
do to my child?!

1155
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:18,241
I didn't hurt her!

1156
01:21:18,274 --> 01:21:20,209
I taught her
how to behave!

1157
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:23,179
I did it for her,
for you, for us.

1158
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:29,652
For us?

1159
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,290
I loved you.

1160
01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:36,259
I loved you blind.

1161
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:37,826
I love you, too.

1162
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:41,097
What did she
ever do to you?!

1163
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,232
No, no!
Listen to me!

1164
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,901
She was just a little girl!

1165
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:48,504
Just a little girl!

1166
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:51,540
She was just a little girl...

1167
01:21:58,314 --> 01:22:00,616
- I love you, Jenny.
- Stay away from me.

1168
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,818
Stay away from you?

1169
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,853
I love you.

1170
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:06,755
I didn't know all of this
was gonna happen.

1171
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:08,757
I wanted the best for us.

1172
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,426
I wanted to be right.

1173
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,096
I wanted to go
drive in my car.

1174
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,964
You gotta believe me.

1175
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:16,465
Come on.

1176
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,142
Oh, my God.

1177
01:22:30,746 --> 01:22:34,017
No...

1178
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:09,618
[police siren sounds]

1179
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,599
Okey dokey.

1180
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:24,767
What do you got here?

1181
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,202
I don't see the jerky here.

1182
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:27,970
You got
the beef jerky in here?

1183
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,115
- Amos Jackson?
- Yeah.

1184
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,684
You're under arrest
for kidnapping.

1185
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:42,785
What?

1186
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:44,019
No!

1187
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:45,988
He didn't kidnap me!
He saved my life!

1188
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,456
It's all right, Lily.

1189
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:49,858
It's all right.

1190
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:52,361
- What you lookin' at?
- Nothin'.

1191
01:23:52,395 --> 01:23:54,763
Nothin'?

1192
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:57,032
Well, you like
little white girls,

1193
01:23:57,066 --> 01:23:59,302
don't ya, boy?

1194
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,471
Amos!

1195
01:24:02,905 --> 01:24:04,307
Amos!

1196
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:07,876
Amos!

1197
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:09,512
- Nathan, look after Lily.
- Yes, sir.

1198
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,480
- Let go!
- Amos.

1199
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:28,264
Today marks a
turning point in history.

1200
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,833
The governor has declared
a state of emergency.

1201
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:33,169
The National Guard
has been called out.

1202
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:35,438
Everyone is preparing
for the worst.

1203
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:37,640
Thousands of men,
women and children

1204
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:40,109
are here to
stand up for freedom.

1205
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:50,553
I believe this one needs
some medical attention.

1206
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,455
What happened to you?

1207
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,593
She'll take care
of you, sweetie.

1208
01:24:58,327 --> 01:25:00,663
Are you that little girl
that's been missing?

1209
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,231
He didn't kidnap me.

1210
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:04,667
I ran away from home
and he saved my life.

1211
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,535
I have to get out of here.

1212
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:08,070
He's my friend.

1213
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,238
He'll be all right.

1214
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:10,773
Let's look at that ankle.

1215
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:17,913
Oh, let's get this
cleaned up.

1216
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:48,311
You stay right here, precious.

1217
01:25:48,344 --> 01:25:49,945
I'll be right back.

1218
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:52,040
All available 
 officers are needed

1219
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:54,142
at the corner of Water 
 and Broad - Immediately!

1220
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:10,225
Amos.

1221
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:11,860
Amos, wake up!

1222
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:16,632
Lily, what are you
doin' in here?

1223
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:19,134
I came to save you
this time, Amos.

1224
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,703
How you gonna do that -

1225
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,405
all them policemen down there?
There's a bunch of 'em.

1226
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:24,807
- I'll be right back.
- Lily?

1227
01:27:38,954 --> 01:27:43,258
* To everything - 
 turn, turn, turn *

1228
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:48,130
* There is a season - 
 turn, turn, turn *

1229
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:55,237
* And a time to every 
 purpose under heaven *

1230
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,306
* A time to build up *

1231
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,708
* A time to break down *

1232
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:01,610
* A time to dance *

1233
01:28:01,644 --> 01:28:04,713
* A time to mourn *

1234
01:28:04,747 --> 01:28:08,016
* A time to cast 
 away stones *

1235
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:15,724
* A time to gather 
 stones together *

1236
01:28:15,758 --> 01:28:20,863
* To everything - 
 turn, turn, turn *

1237
01:28:20,896 --> 01:28:23,098
* There is a season...  *

1238
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,734
Well, my goodness.

1239
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,235
Watercolors, Amos.

1240
01:28:27,269 --> 01:28:29,638
Look at you.
What you doin'?

1241
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,444

1242
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:37,446
* A time to lose *

1243
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:39,382
* A time to rend *

1244
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:41,717
* A time to sow *

1245
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,318
* A time for love *

1246

* A time for hate *

1247
01:28:45,388 --> 01:28:47,890
* A time for peace *

1248
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:52,595
* I swear it's not too late *

1249
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:25,293
Now, Lily, you promised
me you'd call your Momma

1250
01:29:25,327 --> 01:29:28,263
and tell her where you was
and how you was doin'.

1251
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:31,066
I'll keep my promise
if you keep your promise.

1252
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:32,501
C'mon.

1253
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:34,069
Okay.

1254
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:52,555
[phone rings]

1255
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:57,460
Hello...
Hello?

1256
01:29:57,493 --> 01:29:59,562
Grandma, it's me, Lily.

1257
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:02,097
Lily!
Lily, honey!

1258
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,533
Where are you?
Are you all right?

1259
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:06,735
It's Lily.
She's all right.

1260
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:13,375
You were very brave for tellin'
us the truth about Lily.

1261
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,444
You saved so many
people's lives.

1262
01:30:15,478 --> 01:30:17,480
I'm just so proud of you.

1263
01:30:17,513 --> 01:30:19,815
Lily, I need to talk to you.

1264
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:22,217
You don't have
to be afraid anymore.

1265
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,519
Dean's gone.

1266
01:30:23,552 --> 01:30:25,153
He can't hurt you
anymore, Lily.

1267
01:30:25,187 --> 01:30:26,822
What do you mean
Dean's gone?

1268
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:28,290
Where is he?

1269
01:30:28,323 --> 01:30:30,993
He's locked up where he can
never hurt anybody again.

1270
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:32,495
Lily, I am so sorry.

1271
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:33,829
Where's Momma?

1272
01:30:33,862 --> 01:30:34,830
Your Momma's
been everywhere.

1273
01:30:34,863 --> 01:30:36,231
She's in Selma right now.

1274
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,366
Momma's in Selma?

1275
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,668
I'll find her.

1276
01:30:39,702 --> 01:30:40,936
I love you, Grandma.

1277
01:30:43,606 --> 01:30:47,710
It's over...
it's finally over.

1278
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:56,685
Are you all right?

1279
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:14,136
Momma?

1280
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:25,814
Momma!

1281
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,685
Momma!

1282
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:31,153
Lily!

1283
01:31:48,303 --> 01:31:50,305
I'm so sorry, baby.

1284
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:54,276
Grandpa!

1285
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,556
Thank you, Mr. Jackson.

1286
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:08,824
You're welcome.

1287
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,626
She's a very good girl.

1288
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:28,611
I want to thank you
for saving Lily's life.

1289
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:31,046
No, Thomas.
This time...

1290
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:32,881
she saved mine.

1291
01:32:41,356 --> 01:32:43,626
- God bless you.
- Thank you, sir.

1292
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,498
Maybe we can get
some fishin' in.

1293
01:32:50,532 --> 01:32:52,134
I think it's a good idea.

1294
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:54,102
Thank you.

1295
01:32:54,136 --> 01:32:55,638
Sheriff.

1296
01:32:55,671 --> 01:32:57,673
Amos, sorry about
all the trouble.

1297
01:32:57,706 --> 01:32:59,307
Well, we'll work it out.

1298
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,209
Sometimes we have problems.

1299
01:33:53,896 --> 01:33:56,364
I love you, Lily.

1300
01:35:23,018 --> 01:35:26,154
[seagulls in distance]

1301
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:19,741
Amos...

1302
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:27,649
I want to thank you -

1303
01:36:27,682 --> 01:36:29,051
for all the things
you've done,

1304
01:36:29,084 --> 01:36:30,552
for all you've taught me.

1305
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:32,587
You're the only one
who'd listen to me.

1306
01:36:33,822 --> 01:36:36,458
I'll never forget you, Amos.

1307
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:42,064
Well...you take care now.
You hear me?

1308
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,733
All right then.
Bye bye.

1309
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:47,502
Bye.
