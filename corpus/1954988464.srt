00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,136
Like you ain't.

184
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,039
How it taste?

185
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,440
I sucked on a pineapple
candy before I did it.

186
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,912
That's how
you get the taste out.

187
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,212
He is still nasty.

188
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,213
So?

189
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,234
(Schoolbell ringing)

190
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,171
No, no, mama.

191
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,909
Where do you think
you're going?

192
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,144
Where are we going?
No Te preocupes.

193
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,913
This is for the Morris Avenue
companies, okay?

194
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:00,780
Okay.
Thank you, sweetie.

195
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,123
(Man)
Come on, let's go, let's go.

196
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,091
Let's go!

197
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,193
We gotta get these plates out.

198
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,961
Come on we got table
four waiting.

199
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:16,462
Let's go!

200
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:17,930
Jesus.

201
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,172
Work, work, work, work,
work, work!

202
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,573
Ah, yes, hey!

203
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,142
Pussy, pussy.
Ow, ow, ow, hey!

204
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,278
Ow, ow!
Pussy, pussy.

205
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,247
Down... ow!

206
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,451
I feel like...
Yes, bitch.

207
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,488
(Playful chattering)

208
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,975
Here you go, papa.

209
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,912
Mmm, baby,
you killing it.
Thank you.

210
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,379
This food is amazing.

211
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,251
(Phone ringing)

212
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,285
Michael...

213
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,055
Do you mind
not doing that at the table?

214
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,327
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

215
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,134
I got a surprise for you.

216
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,912
Next week, me and you.

217
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,648
I got tickets
to the game, papa!

218
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,916
You know, at the new stadium.

219
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,986
Look at how close those seats
are next to like, home plate.

220
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,186
Check it out.

221
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,564
What's the matter, you don't
like the baseball no more?

222
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,265
It's okay, I guess.

223
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,502
Just okay, huh?

224
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,604
You wouldn't understand.

225
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,206
Okay, then tell me, Mike.

226
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,109
Talk to me,
make me understand.

227
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,211
You don't like baseball
no more?

228
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,413
Fine, I get that.

229
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,383
What do you like, Michael?

230
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,250
Football?

231
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:21,955
Basketball?

232
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,389
You like school?

233
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,390
Oh, I love it.

234
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,193
(Angela giggling)

235
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,595
Yeah?

236
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,330
What'd you
learn in class today?

237
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,299
I don't know...
the usual.

238
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,102
Yeah?

239
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,203
You weren't
learning how to cut class

240
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,570
With your little faggoty
little friends?

241
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,072
Enrique!

242
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,239
It ain't like I never
cut class before,

243
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,340
But don't lie to me.

244
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,109
Enrique!

245
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,211
You can't follow me
around, Papi.

246
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,177
Sit down.

247
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,580
I don't go following
you around.

248
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,449
What's up
with your hands, man?

249
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,651
Put your hands
down and talk to me like a man.

250
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,285
I didn't raise you to be
like that.

251
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,223
You didn't raise me!

252
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:00,960
You can't just come in here
and try to be "Papi" now.

253
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,996
Well, I am your papi, I am!

254
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,665
Dejalo, Kike.

255
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:09,668
(Phone ringing)

256
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,362
"Creating a vagina
approximately

257
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38.464
"Seven centimeters
deep in seven days,

258
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,366
Although it can be
more than this."

259
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,634
I'm sure it will be.

260
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,303
Ooh, this one
is mad pretty, Vee.

261
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,338
Look, you circled this
one here.

262
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,674
It look like a flower

263
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,210
That's one dusty
ass flower.

264
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,310
Hater, ew.

265
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,080
Don't turn the page yet,
I'm looking.

266
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,246
All these is nasty.

267
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,715
No, they not,
they beautiful.

268
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,716
Taste good, too.

269
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:57,650
Whatever!

270
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,352
Michael ain't never even
felt a pussy before.

271
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,020
Probably ain't
seen one neither.

272
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,689
That true?

273
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,556
Wanna feel mines?

274
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,692
That's so OD...
She gonna cut yo ass!

275
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,127
Get your ass away
from me.

276
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,295
(All laughing)

277
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,629
Sup with old boy from
the club?

278
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,730
Y'all do the nasty yet?

279
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,132
No, bitch.

280
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,133
Y'all so crazy.

281
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,269
He might not want you to
cut your pee-pee off.

282
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,404
That nigga playing
the trade.

283
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,405
You told him?

284
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,471
Yeah.

285
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,209
He plays the trade!
(Girl)
Shut up, Antoine!

286
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,277
He ain't after your ass, so
why you worried about it?

287
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,078
How he gonna want her

288
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,478
After she told
him she got a dick

289
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,847
If he ain't playing
the trade?

290
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,515
Cause she's
a bad bitch!

291
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,518
(All laughing)

292
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,658
(Knocking)

293
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,561
(Woman)
No, Mami, no.

294
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,297
I cannot be bothered this week,
I told you Saturday.

295
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm not being
fresca, you know I love you.

296
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:58,111
(Phone vibrating)

297
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,597
Hello?

298
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,298
Who's this?

299
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:34,580
I can't believe I'm this
fucking stupid.

300
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,515
You're not stupid.

301
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,351
Hector, no, come on.

302
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,893
How's my little man?

303
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,230
He's good.

304
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,165
So go ahead.

305
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:55,668
Tell me to go fuck
myself.

306
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,270
Tell me what
a fucking bitch I am

307
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:01,140
Because I don't know what
a good man I'm losing.

308
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,277
That's not what I was
gonna say.

309
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,646
I will tell you this...

310
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:12,452
I wish we had more time.

311
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,495
Somebody needs to go there and
stomp that nigga, son!

312
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,464
Entiende?

313
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,497
Yeah, he lives up on
Webster Ave,

314
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,565
Right by my cousin Tina.

315
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,634
Just say the word,
E. Man, okay,

316
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,935
And it's done, we got
you, man, we got you.

317
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:34,473
You don't have to worry about

318
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,243
(Man)
We gonna
fuck him up, E.

319
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,412
I'll handle it.

320
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,413
Oh, shit, this
mother fucker's gonna do

321
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,382
Some Lone Ranger type shit.

322
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,218
Come on, man... talk to this
motherfucker, man.

323
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,519
Hey, you sure, E.?
Yo, I got it.

324
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,822
What the fuck, man?
I don't know, B.

325
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,591
Mira, Mira quein esta alli,

326
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,560
Ay yi yi...
Tu viste eso?

327
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,862
Her daughter, son?

328
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,273
What are you doing,
Angie?

329
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,707
I'm getting ready
for bed.

330
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,512
Don't you miss me?

331
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,348
Enrique, please not now,
I'm tired.

332
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,017
Yeah, what
you tired from?

333
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:19,618
Life.

334
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:28,395
Life, huh?

335
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,529
I thought you were tired
from going

336
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,696
With that new
boyfriend of yours.

337
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,863
What are
you talking about?

338
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,532
I don't got no
boyfriend.

339
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,635
No?
No...
what are you, deaf?

340
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,636
Don't lie to me,
Angie.

341
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,005
I ain't fucking stupid.

342
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,479
Look, I don't expect
anybody to wait three years.

343
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:50,582
That ain't natural.

344
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,618
I was up north.

345
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:56,289
You had to do
what you had to do.

346
00:20:56,323 --> 00:21:00,692
But I'm home now.

347
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,529
I don't want to see
no dudes.

348
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,033
I don't
want to smell it.

349
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,602
That's it.

350
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:13,972
If you want me,
it can only be me.

351
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,351
Okay.

352
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:49,741
You know
I missed you, Enrique.

353
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,945
You sure?

354
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:58,918
Of course, stupid.

355
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,320
Hold me.

356
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:20,739
(Heavy breathing and moaning)

357
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:25,737
*

358
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,761
(Danny)
Uh-oh, back that shit up.
Enrique mento!

359
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,531
Hey, Mike!

360
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,032
Want to bat?

361
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,833
Come on, Mike!

362
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,809
Yeah... Yeah!

363
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,943
Remember how we used
to do it?

364
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,578
Hey, he's gonna mess up
the whole flow of the game.

365
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,779
Dejalo, dejalo...
Come on.

366
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:07,814
That's gonna throw
everything off.

367
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,114
Danny, just
throw the ball, dude.

368
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,817
Man, he's gonna take
my spot.
All right.

369
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,785
Remember how we used to do it
in little league, right?

370
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,921
Choke up on the bat,
put your shoulder into it.

371
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,624
Come on, throw him a nice juicy
one so he can smack it!

372
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,790
Yo, what if he hits
a home run?

373
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:19,925
Yo, just shut up
and throw the ball, B.

374
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,226
Okay.

375
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,894
Ponsela, ponsela!

376
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:23,996
Come on, Michael!

377
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,464
Esta seria, aqui.

378
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,068
Go, go!

379
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,236
Go, run it out!

380
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,741
Run Michael, run it out,
run it out!

381
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,807
Run!

382
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,980
It's okay, that's okay.

383
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,682
You want to take another
at bat?

384
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,183
No, it's okay.

385
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,854
(Cell phone ringing)

386
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,162
Ma, I'm gonna run,
okay?

387
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:58,497
Okay, mi Amor.

388
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,002
Where's he going?

389
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:07,039
I don't know...
with his friends?

390
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,807
(Woman)
You can keep it up.

391
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,677
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

392
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,912
Why you let him play with that
shit for?

393
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,847
Let him be, Enriquito.

394
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,816
He's a little man, why don't you
put a ball in his hand?

395
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,149
Get him out there with
the other kids?

396
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:18,984
Do me a favor, E.,

397
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,120
Don't worry
about raising my kids.

398
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,589
They have me for that.

399
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,222
Worry about your
own kid.

400
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,456
What's that supposed
to mean, huh?

401
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,595
I'm just saying, be a father to
your own kid, that's all.

402
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,228
Cayense,
cayense la Boca.

403
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,699
Be nice.
Igualito a papi, no?

404
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,702
Callate la Boca!
What you talking about
papi for?

405
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:36,803
That nigga was never there.

406
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,571
Yeah, E., and how are
you any better?

407
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,172
Stop it, puñeta!

408
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,873
What are you saying to
me right now?

409
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:43,042
What the fuck, Karina?

410
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,977
I told you not to curse
in front of the fucking kids,

411
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,946
You fucking fuck.

412
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:55,755
*

413
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,305
You said your mother
was upstairs?

414
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:30,408
Yeah, but she don't
bother me though.

415
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,342
Why don't you sit down?

416
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,379
Make yourself comfortable,
know what I mean?

417
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,230
You did that?

418
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,900
Yeah.

419
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,402
Why you ain't talking?

420
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,337
I'm talking.

421
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,371
Why don't you come
a little closer

422
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,240
So you can
hear what I'm saying?

423
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,084
Know what I mean?

424
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,950
Damn, you look sexy.

425
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,124
Wait.

426
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,995
What, they ain't real?

427
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,596
Not yet.

428
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,800
What you mean, not yet?

429
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,203
I mean not yet.

430
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,841
They gonna be real soon.

431
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:12,343
It costs mad guap I just
don't got right now.

432
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,147
Well how much
it cost?

433
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,183
$400 a month.

434
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:21,152
Ma, I got you, that
ain't nothing.

435
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,989
Just like that?

436
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,358
Yeah.

437
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:30,196
Just like that.

438
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,498
You got me?

439
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,537
Yeah.

440
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,163
You... you got a candy?

441
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,964
Come here.

442
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,331
What?
What do you mean, "what"?

443
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:45,171
You see what time
it is?

444
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,371
What you got that shit on
your head for?

445
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,539
Take it off.

446
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:48,507
Take what off?

447
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,276
I said, take that
shit off!
Pa, papi, stop!

448
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,079
Take it off!
(Angela)
Enrique, no!

449
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:54,245
My hair!
No!

450
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,082
What?

451
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,120
Pa...
Angie, this shit ends now.

452
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:01,920
Stop it...
Enrique, no!

453
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,722
Leave it alone, he's not
hurting anybody!

454
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,157
Papi, no, stop,
I'm sorry!

455
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:07,326
You don't disrespect
this house.

456
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,260
Sit the fuck down,
right now.

457
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,461
Don't do this,
he's not hurting anybody.

458
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,562
Put your fucking hands down.

459
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,598
You're a fucking man, Michael,
You're not a woman!

460
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,534
No, no!
Get your fucking hands...

461
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,237
Why you doing this?

462
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,107
Why are you defending
this shit, huh?

463
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,475
Don't you understand...
this can't happen.

464
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,278
You're supposed
to have my back, Angie.

465
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,248
Kike... Kike!

466
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,450
Stop it...
just stand still.

467
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,552
Papi!
Stop it!

468
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,154
Papi, please stop!

469
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,156
Shh.
Papi!

470
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,457
Stop, stop.

471
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,000
I fucking love you.

472
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:52,337
I'm not going to let you
do this to yourself.

473
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,007
Be strong, be strong.

474
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,475
There you go.

475
00:32:56,508 --> 00:33:00,146
There you go...
beautiful man.

476
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,410
Viente nueve, trienta.

477
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,147
You got 30 pills
here.

478
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,616
And you got
the testosterone blocker.

479
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,317
Okay?

480
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,520
Otherwise you be growing
a beard with tetas.

481
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:42,721
You don't want that.

482
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,489
That should take
care of you for the month.

483
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,824
Anything else?

484
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:49,394
Um...

485
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:53,464
Oh, you wanna get
pumped... huh?

486
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,333
You got the coins?

487
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,312
Yo, damn,
that needle's big.

488
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,180
I can't believe you
doing this shit.

489
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,516
The price you pay
for beauty.

490
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,317
You want some, too?

491
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,553
I'm just here for moral
support, mama.

492
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,422
You want anything
on top?

493
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,657
No, Papi would kill me.

494
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,525
Okay, just the culo?

495
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,661
Okay.

496
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:25,463
Here... you can hold me
if you want, mama.

497
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,700
Oh, hell, no.

498
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:34,305
Try not to move.

499
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,708
Can you pass me
that, please?

500
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:41,780
This?
Thank you.

501
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:45,284
What the fuck?
It is the fastest way.

502
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,318
Does it look good?

503
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:50,289
You gonna
look hot, mamita.

504
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,600
Yo, wait till you see
this place, E.

505
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,402
It's like
an amusement park.

506
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,437
They got like a butcher
shop in there.

507
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,571
They got a club in there.

508
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,176
Yo, they got these like plush
brand new seats, kid.

509
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,510
I don't even know how
they play baseball in there.

510
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,145
It's like a hangout.

511
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,184
What's up, bro?

512
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:21,252
What the fuck
are the chances, bro?

513
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,788
You should see the way this
nigga walks around

514
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,457
Waving his arms and shit.

515
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,326
That's wild, B, but come on
don't worry about it.

516
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,760
When Angie
was pregnant, right,

517
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,329
She had this...

518
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,498
Um, they did the thing,
you know where...

519
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,766
Sonogram.
Yeah, sonogram.

520
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,502
They told me it was a boy,
I was like wow.

521
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,273
I gave that nigga
my name.

522
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:42,808
Enrique Michael Rodriguez.

523
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,375
That's my name, son.

524
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,412
Bro, I don't know what
to say, man.

525
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:48,479
I mean, I hear
you, bro, I hear you.

526
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,781
But the fuck, bro?

527
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,750
What if that's
his life, man, that's him.

528
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,784
That's his life?

529
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,521
That's my life...
That's my boy, you understand?

530
00:35:56,554 --> 00:36:01,360
You know, he took that
from me.

531
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,295
He took
that shit from me.

532
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,540
Yes, Mr. Rodriguez?

533
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:15,674
Can I use the bathroom?

534
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,774
Come on, Michael, just go.

535
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,509
You don't
have to interrupt.

536
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,593
Oye, papa, ven!

537
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,561
What's up?

538
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,862
Damn.

539
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,665
What happened, huh?

540
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,833
Damn!

541
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,303
Rodriguez?

542
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,937
Does this look
like a beet salad, hmm?

543
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:20,906
This just came back.

544
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,608
My best salad just came back
looking like that.

545
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,709
Yo, I don't know...
This is unacceptable.

546
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,578
Fix me a new one...
now.

547
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,521
Is there a problem?

548
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,295
All right, where do you
think you're going... Come on...

549
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:56,641
*

550
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,462
You know, it doesn't
look that bad.

551
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,298
I actually think
it looks kind of cute.

552
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:30,842
What?

553
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,379
I'm not pretty no more.

554
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,957
You are beautiful.

555
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,494
You hear me?

556
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,739
Why did he have to
come back?

557
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,043
I wish he could
have just stayed up there.

558
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,713
You could have married
Hector.

559
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,681
You're just saying that.

560
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,684
You're just
saying that, okay?

561
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,541

562
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,019

Man, roll 'em, man,

578
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,960
Shaking them down ain't gonna
make no difference.

00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,761

00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:57,942
Come on,
don't be like that.

609
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,910
Don't be hitting me, I'll smack
that fat ass of yours.

Hold up, hold up.

Yeah.

621
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,764
Yeah?

622
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,847
I don't want to see
shit, a'ight?

623
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,949
You won't see nothing.

624
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,360
Okay.

625
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,170

What's up?

630
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:22,046
Well, you know when
we met,

631
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,051
How you said you
were gonna take me out?

632

Yeah.

633
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,591
Well, how come you don't
take me out?

634
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:39,998
How come you only
ask me to come to your room?

635
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,500
What, you don't
like coming over here?

636
00:46:42,532 --> 00:46:45,202
No, of course I do.

637

How come we

You know like, to the movies,

00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:02,820
Cause that shit

641
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:09,160
I don't think its whack.

642
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:12,297

644
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,845
That's pretty good.
Mm-hmm.

I heard you did a good job
taking care of them

662
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,425
When I was gone.

663
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,995
Yeah.

Watch him come for
my finger.

Mete Tu mano right there.

677
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,284
Watch that, the water.

Yeah, just like...
Hold it right there.

I don't know if I thanked
you for that.

688
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,142
You're welcome.

689
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,000
Stop.

690
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,763
Just make sure you don't
ride the clutch too much.

691
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:40,530
You want to give her a break
every once in a while,

692
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,499
So she can last.
You pay for all this.

693
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:43,801
Otherwise you'll be back
spending your money.

Yeah.

712
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:15,606
Hey, what's up?

713

Stay away
from the bullshit.

00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,512
(Angela)
Enrique?

725
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,113
Yeah, in the bathroom, ma.

726
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,051
What are you doing?
What do you mean?

727
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,588
Isn't tonight Michael's
school thing?

728
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:42,493
Yeah, but I didn't think
you were going.

729
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:44,595
Now you got a hot date.

730
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:48,132
It's not that big a deal.

731
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,700
You're not embarrassed,
are you?

732
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:51,701
Of course not.

733
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:53,571
I just thought you were
working, that's all.

734
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:56,873
I took off.

735
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,176
For this?

736
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,745
Yeah.

737
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,518
Didn't your father ever teach
you how to tie a tie?

738
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:10,821
No, he didn't.

739
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,928
You know...

740
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,129
I didn't mean to make you
do anything

741
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,099
You didn't want to do.

742
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,700
I'm chillin' yo.

743
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:33,744
Oh shit, my dude...
That's a nigga right there.

744
00:58:33,777 --> 00:58:35,546
No gas, no gas!

745
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,980
Oh!

746
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:44,221
You just
gonna stand there?

747
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:46,923
You're not gonna say
anything?

748
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,858
Yo, what you want me
to say, yo?

749
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:51,161
It ain't
like they lying.

750
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:53,863
You know,
you're fucked up.

751
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,232
Yo.

752
00:58:55,264 --> 00:58:57,234
Yo, you ain't my girl.

753
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:59,303
You need to chill
the fuck out, a'ight?

754
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:03,006
Oh, so I'm good enough
for you to fuck

755
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,540
And for me
to suck your dick,

756
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,611
But I'm not your
girl?

757
00:59:06,644 --> 00:59:08,813
Well, then fuck you...
fuck you!

758
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,983
Yo, you good?

759
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,719
I'm good, yo.

760
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:16,686
Wait, Chris.

761
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,889
Get the fuck off
me, man!

762
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:20,990
Then go, go!

763
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,026
Get the fuck outta
here, maricon!

764
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:32,102
So Michael is one of my
favorite students.

765
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:33,370
Rodriguez.

766
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:34,872
Sorry?

767
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,040
Michael Rodriguez is
our son.

768
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:40,110
No, yeah,
I meant Michael Rodriguez.

769
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:41,978
He's got a knack
for poetry.

770
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:46,015
He writes
beautifully, you know.

771
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,952
It must be difficult
for you, though.

772
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:49,919
How so?

773
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,689
Well, I mean with the issues
Michael's having.

774
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:52,956
You know, the...

775
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,891
His refusal to
use the boy's bathroom,

776
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,894
The eyeliner in class,
et cetera.

777
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:58,928
You know, all
the things you and I spoke of

778
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:00,765
A month ago Mrs. Rodriguez...

779
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,739
You made me look like
a fool in there.

780
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:09,839
It isn't like that,
Kike.

781
01:00:09,874 --> 01:00:11,108
Listen.
No, I have been listening.

782
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:12,910
You been keeping a lot of
shit from me.

783
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,811
I'm supposed to
find out from his teacher?

784
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:18,683
How the hell you think that
makes me look, huh?

785
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:19,816
He's walking
around out here,

786
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,652
Going to the fucking
girl's bathroom?

787
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:23,420
What the fuck's
that say about me?

788
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:25,889
I'm sorry, I thought this
was about Michael.

789
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:27,957
Don't fucking start,
Angie!

790
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:28,993
You don't need
that shit anyway.

791
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,661
Like, not at all.

792
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:35,700
Wait, check you out.

793
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:38,101
Girl, you ain't all
churchgoing goody two shoes.

794
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,336
Look at that frumpy
old church.

795
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:40,436
It moved, God moved.

796
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:41,938
Shut up, puta.

797
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:02,892
Kike, please!

798
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,935
What the fuck.

799
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,037
What the fuck
is this?

800
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:15,005
What the...

801
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,180
Oh...

802
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:27,383
Enrique.
That's my son.

803
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:31,020
No...
not my boy.

804
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,357
Kike, listen.
No.

805
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,492
You didn't notice your
shit was missing?

806
01:01:35,524 --> 01:01:37,862
Don't blame me for
this, E.!

807
01:01:37,895 --> 01:01:39,095
What the fuck were you doing
this whole time?

808
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,064
I was working, pendejo!

809
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,199
Where were you, huh?

810
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,367
Tough guy?

811
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,368
No.
Where were you?

812
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:47,036
Angie, you don't
get it.

813
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,239
The shit that...

814
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:52,843
Goes down
behind those walls.

815
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:54,879
You can't understand.

816
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,051
And here, my son wants
to be like this.

817
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:10,795
(Music playing from club)

818
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,368
(Woman)
All right!

819
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,538
So we ready to keep
it going?

820
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,809
Let's welcome up to the...

821
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:26,777
She needs no introduction.

822
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:29,178
Vanessa from the Boogie Down!

823
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,815
(Cheers and applause)

824
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:33,250
Show 'em how it's done.

825
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,428
I'm trying something a little
bit different.

826
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:51,435
I am standing right here.

827
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:54,271
Tucked in the mess of
my own fear.

828
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,572
Far from fine.

829
01:02:56,605 --> 01:02:59,208
In your eyes I seem to fall
farther and faster

830
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,846
Than you have
time to catch me.

831
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,780
From a boy balanced on
his shoulders

832
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,215
Who can take on the stars.

833
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,451
Where were you from bedtime
to dawn?

834
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,121
Tucking me in,
instead of ducking out.

835
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:12,922
Where are your arms when
I just need them

836
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:17,127
To wrap around and hold me?

837
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:21,230
I am standing right here,
just as you left me.

838
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:25,836
I am begging
right here for you to see me.

839
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:29,406
I will try and I will try.

840
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,409
I'll try to be whoever
you need me.

841
01:03:32,441 --> 01:03:34,111
See me.

842
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,349
(Cheering and applauding)

843
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,486
Right there in front of your
fucking boy,

844
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:44,421
I don't give a shit.

845
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,158
Papa!

846
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,494
Vente.

847
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,161
Ven aca.

848
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,196
Vamanos.

849
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,464
Where we going?

850
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,065
We're going
for a little ride.

851
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:15,185
(Woman)
Entra.

852
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:21,290
You can sit down.

853
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:24,327
Not me, Michael.

854
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,096
Have a seat.

855
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:27,630
Este es Tu hijo?

856
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:31,235
Si, ese es...
hagale un hombre.

857
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,670
Mira.

858
01:04:33,702 --> 01:04:36,105
No Te preocupes.

859
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37.474
Él no habla español
muy bien.

860
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:40,978
¿Ah, no habla español?

861
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,913
That's a pity...

862
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:49,920
(Door opening and closing)

863
01:05:13,978 --> 01:05:16,612
You have
pretty eyes.

864
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,315
Anyone tell you
that?

865
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,424
Shh, shh.

866
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,258
It's okay.

867
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:30,995
I'm not gonna
hurt you.

868
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,248
Give me that.

869
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,135
Aqui.

870
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,237
Ay.

871
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:20,376
Ay, that's it, papi,
Mira, asi.

872
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,378
It's okay, papito.

873
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:26,315
Shh, shh, shh.

874
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:30,220
Sweet, sweet boy.

875
01:06:30,253 --> 01:06:33,389
Shh...

876
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,026
Shh, shh.

877
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:55,779
(Crying)

878
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:12,362
Tate tranquilito,
shh, shh...

879
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:39,323
(Micheal crying)

880
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:46,096
*

881
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:20,429
(Crying)

882
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,288
Where is he?

883
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,530
Kike.

884
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:29,266
Did you hurt
my baby?

885
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,566
No, I...

886
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,303
You son of
a bitch.

887
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:37,573
What did you do, where
is he?

888
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:41,477
Where is he?
I don't know!

889
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,313
You're going to
find him.

890
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:46,982
As God is my witness,
you are going to find him.

891
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,552
Yes... yes, you!

892
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,755
I'll call the police,
I swear to God.

893
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,858
I swear to God I will throw
you back in that cage

894
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:57,560
If you don't
bring my baby home.

895
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:58,627
Baby, how the fuck
am I supposed to know

896
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,563
Where he is?
I don't give a fuck!

897
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:01,965
I don't give a fuck.

898
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,200
I don't give a fuck,
you will figure it out.

899
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,670
Go, go, go!
Okay, okay.

900
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:13,510
Fuck, I'm ready to go inside
and get in shape.

901
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:15,612
I think my baby girl is in
for a treat tonight.

902
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,681
(Man)
Yo, that's the shorty that
wanted me to wifey it up,

903
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,583
But she let the next nigga
hit it.

904
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:21,585
I was like, "How you want me to
wifey it up"

905
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,253
And you let dude hit?"

906
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:25,822
Shit, that's why you can't trust
these bitches, man.

907
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,524
(Pete)
Can't trust
niggas, neither, man.

908
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,359
Yo, she even got the name
"Danny" tattooed on her pussy,

909
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:31,828
But I don't know if it
was for me,

910
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33.629
'Cause that
nigga's named Danny, too.

911
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:36,366
(Laughing)

912
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,767
Nah, that shit ain't
funny, Tico.

913
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:40,003
A'ight!

914
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,641
Yo, I don't think
Michael's around here.

915
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:47,643
Yo, just
keep driving man.

916
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,647
Yo, stop the car.

917
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:58,687
Yo, Pete, let me get
that ratchet...

918
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,256
You all right, B.?

919
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:13,802
(Club music playing)

920
01:11:18,675 --> 01:11:19,908
Yo, come with me.

921
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,546
You all right?

922
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,680
Where y'all going?

923
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,494
What you want, man?

924
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,429
Yo, just get back
down there.

925
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:41,697
Yo, what the fuck man?

926
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,768
Just shut the...
Shut the fuck up.

927
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,637
Right there, turn around.

928
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,840
Look at me.

929
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:58,582
*

930
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,657
Open your legs.

931
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,393
Open your fucking legs!

932
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,660
I got
a wife and kids, man.

933
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:12,562
Yeah, you got wifey?

934
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:13,697
Yeah?

935
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:15,931
Open your fucking legs!

936
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,414
You like to touch wifey?

937
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:31,648
Huh, huh?

938
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,817
Motherfucker!

939
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,051
E., E.!

940
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,653
Come on, lets go.

941
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:38,654
Come on, man.

942
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,723
E.!

943
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,527
Huh?

944
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,431
You good, B.?
Yeah.

945
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:48,998
Come on, man, let's go.

946
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,166
Come on.

947
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,969
Come on, we gotta go,
we gotta go.

948
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:57,840
(Club music thumping)

949
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:18,994
(Cell phone vibrating)

950
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,029
Hello?

951
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:24,867
Okay.

952
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:29,171
Okay, thank you.

953
01:14:02,572 --> 01:14:04,440
He's at Hector's.

954
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,082
It's not me he's running
away from.

955
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,636
17 years, Kike.

956
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:35,804
I gave
my life to you.

957
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:38,542
It was hard, but
I did it.

958
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:39,842
I put my trust
in you because I knew

959
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,845
You would take care
of us.

960
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:46,782
But now my baby's
out there.

961
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,519
E., I don't know
what happened to you up there,

962
01:14:49,553 --> 01:14:52,721
But it has nothing to do
with Michael.

963
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:54,190
The boy loves you.

964
01:14:54,222 --> 01:14:57,926
He needs you.

965
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,163
We need you.

966
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:20,148
*

967
01:16:01,658 --> 01:16:03,593
(Knocking)

968
01:16:03,627 --> 01:16:04,560
(Door creaking open)

969
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,995
(Manny)
Hold it, hold it.

970
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,664
Right there, right
there.

971
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:30,186
I just want my family.

972
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,622
Can I talk to him?

973
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,138
Son.

974
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:51,808
Um...

975
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,010
I know I've made a lot
of mistakes.

976
01:16:55,043 --> 01:17:01,049
I still don't know
what I'm doing, you know.

977
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:04,620
I never meant to
hurt you.

978
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,758
My son.

979
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,094
My boy.

980
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:16,132
My baby boy.

981
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,970
My flesh and blood, pa.

982
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:29,111
But you ain't no baby
no more.

983
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,051
You can make
your own decisions.

984
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:52,901
We want just want you
back home, son.

985
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:56,272
Just come back home.

986
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:59,776
All right?

987
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:27,937
(Whispering prayer)

988
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:33,009
*

989
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:57,219
Get the fuck off!

990
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,187
Get the...

991
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,556
Wait up, wait up!

992
01:21:00,588 --> 01:21:04,860
Michael... Michael!

993
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,197
Michael... Micheal!

994
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:10,199
Micheal!

995
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:13,468
