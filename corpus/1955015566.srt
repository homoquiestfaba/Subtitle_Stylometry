1
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:56,081
Welcome! Welcome!

2
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:57,416
Congrats, Drac.

3
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,719
Holy smokes,
everybody's here.

4
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,222
Mr. and Mrs. Loughran,
the parents of the groom, and family.

5
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,029
Mom and Dad!
Johnny!

6
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:11,830
I can't believe
you're all here.

7
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,654
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

8
00:02:36,855 --> 00:02:38,891
Yo, how hot is my date?

9
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,726
So hot. Wow.

10
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,161
How 'bout how hot mine is?

11
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,129
You got a date?

12
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:47,299
Yeah. She's invisible.
That's why you can't see her.

13
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,966
Oh, right. This is
the one from "Canada"?

14
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,136
Wedding's starting.

15
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,180
Ah!

16
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:06,151
Oh!

17
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:10,855
Aw!

18
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:49,528
Whoo-hoo!

19
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,529
Great.

20
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:01,607
True. So true, Marty.

21
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:02,841
Aw!

22
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:18,290
Aw. How sweet.

23
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,895
Oh, my. Look at you.

24
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,576
Oh, my gosh.

25
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:27,798
Oh.

26
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:43,181
Is it everything you wanted,
my little poisonberry?

27
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,716
Oh, it is, Daddy.

28
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,753
Except where's Grandpa Vlad?

29
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,289
Honey, your gramps
would not have been cool with this.

30
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:52,090
He's old-school.

31
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,493
How do we know?
If he could just meet Johnny...

32
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,261
He would have eaten him.

33
00:04:56,328 --> 00:04:59,197
He's not as
enlightened as your hip Daddy.

34
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,668
So, you're really okay
with him not being a monster?

35
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:06,705
Human, monster, unicorn,
as long as you're happy.

36
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:08,941

Oh, hey, guys!

47
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,390
Todd, take a break.

48
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,762
So, what's up?

49
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:07,232
Mavis was wondering if maybe you
wanted to go for a fly.

50
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:11,470
Oh. We haven't done that in forever.
Any special reason?

51
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,038
No special reason at all.

52
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:15,340
Right, Mavey?

53
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,242
What's his deal?

54
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,610
He's silly.

55
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,646
It's just a beautiful night, and...

56
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:22,381
Well, if you don't want to...

57
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:23,915
No, no! Are you kidding?

58
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,485
I would eat a bucket of
garlic to fly with you.

59
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,423
Oh, honey,
look at those fluffy clouds.

60
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,560
Remember what we played
when you were little?

61
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:11,430
Hide and Go
Seek Sharp Objects?

62
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:15,100
Okay.
Regular Hide and Go Seek.

63
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,104
Where are you?

64
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,442
Honeybat!

65
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:26,645
Mavey!

66
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,848
Honeybat!

67
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:33,585
I'm gonna get you.

68
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,660
Honey? Are you okay?

69
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,628
Yes.
It's just a little harder

70
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,864
to catch my breath
since I'm pregnant.

71
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:48,266
Yes, well, I guess
that would make it more...

72
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,401
What?

73
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:58,977
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

74
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,749
And I'm gonna be a dad!

75
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,320
♪ 'Cause you're
Daddy's girl, or boy ♪

76
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:11,256

77
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,058
I'm hungry again, honey.

78
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,885
Can you get me
some ice cream with anchovies?

79
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,464
No, no, no. You mustn't give
in to your cravings.

80
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,700
It's not good for the baby.

81
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,802
You need to increase
your spider intake,

82
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,303
so he'll be able to
climb ceilings properly.

83
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,038
And eat lots of sheep bile.

84
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,909
I love you,
Dad, but we don't even know

85
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,011
if the kid's
gonna be a vampire.

86
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:36,014
I'd be thrilled if the baby's human-y,
just like Johnny.

87
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,217
"Human-y." With thousands
of years of Dracula genes.

88
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,551
Not gonna happen.

89
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,554
As long as the baby's healthy.

90
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,990
Of course.
A healthy little vampire.

91
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,124
Or human.

92
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:49,194
Yes, a human who can
fly as a bat.

93
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,863
Here. Just have
some monster ball soup.

94
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,799
It's your mommy's recipe.

95
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,701
Aw!

96
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,438
Thank you, Dad.

97
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:03,642
Just like you made it when I was a kid.
My favorite.

98
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:16,488
Sorry.

99
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:34,473
Sir, only the father is allowed
in the delivery room.

100
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:36,808
Really? I mean, okay.

101
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,977
He's the family, I guess.

102
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,919
Oh, look!
It's a boy! It's a boy!

103
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,790
The Dracula
bloodline carries on!

104
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,193
No one will ever harm you
as long as I'm here,

105
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,429
my little devil dog.

106
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,030
Dad, can I hold my baby?

107
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:01,366
If I were Dad, I'd say yes.

108
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,802
But I'm the nurse, Francine.

109
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,904
Here you go anyway.

110
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:14,246
My bad.

111
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,986
Little Dennis is
a year old now. Wow!

112
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,025
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

113
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:33,565
Okay, time for presents, guys.

114
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:37,235
All right!
Let's do this boy up!

115
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,371
Check out what I got him.
Bling!

116
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,339
Wow. Is it cursed?

117
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,375
Super cursed.
Only the best.

118
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,644
Straight from the crypt.

119
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,314
He's just starting to walk,
so maybe it's heavier than...

120
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,052
Oh. You're okay, Denisovich.

121
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,688
His name is Dennis.
Named after my father.

122
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,890
It's not his vampire name.

123
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,359
My little
Denisovichy-Weesovichy.

124
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:04,129
Huh!
Are we sure he's a vampire?

125
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,131
I mean,
not that it's a bad thing,

126
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:10,435
but shouldn't he have fangs
and that pasty skin you guys have?

127
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:13,939
Technically, you have until you're five
to get your vampire fangs.

128
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:15,874
Oh, he'll get his fangs.
He's a Dracula.

129
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,209
He's also half Loughran.

130
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:21,279
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.
There's more humans there.

131
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:24,716
What? Look how well he's playing
with the wolf pups.

132
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:31,656
We have a present.
I hope it's acceptable.

133
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,459
"My First Guillotine."

134
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,629
Very educational.
Well played, Frank.

135
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,966
It's great. Thank you.
We just have to baby-proof that.

136
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:45,370
Johnny, do you know
where you put the rubber guards?

137
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,406
Baby-proofing a guillotine?

138
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:52,010
So you cut your finger off.
It's part of the fun.

139
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,412
She made me
baby-proof the whole hotel.

140
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,881
Someone's overprotective.

141
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,227
Aah!

142
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,428
Hmm?

143
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,875
Johnny! Come quick!

144
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,446
What's up? He's okay?

145
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:30,033
Dennis said his first word!

146
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,750
He did?

147
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:33,785
Come on, honey.
Say it again.

148
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:34,853
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

149
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,757
I don't say,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

150
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:41,526
We didn't say you did.

151
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:42,633
Then where did
he get that?

152
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,962
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

153
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,297
Well, maybe sometimes you say it.

154
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:48,366
I only say it when I
say I don't say it!

155
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:50,368
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

156
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,871
Okay, kid.
We get it. You can talk.

157
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,107
Denisovich.

158
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,810
Dad.

159
00:12:58,877 --> 00:12:59,957
Just checking for cavities.

160
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,749
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

161
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,017
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

162
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:08,119
It was you!

163
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,265
Oh, my goodness, Leonard.

164
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,200
If you really
looked that hideous,

165
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:24,035
I don't think I
could hang out with you.

166
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,637
Guys, what's the deal?

167
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,606
Is this a party?
Pick up a phone.

168
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:33,878
I don't care if Johnny said it's a "cool app."
Johnny's still new here.

169
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:37,248
Now, Porridge Head, did you call a hearse
for the Gremlinbergs?

170
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,752
No, you're checking
your Facebook page. Again.

171
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,554
Drac, I told the guys social media

172
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,089
is the best way to
promote the hotel.

173
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,356
Right, Clifton?

174
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,527
So, Drac, I wanted
to go through some thoughts I had,

175
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:52,597
as your new human relations
coordinating co-assistant.

176
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:53,998
Sure. It's a real job.

177
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:57,068
Not a cheap excuse to keep Mavis happy,
so you never leave here.

178
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:59,704
Right. So,
I was thinking,

179
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:03,741
since we have so many humans now,
maybe update some of the acts?

180
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,210
Like, maybe the magician?

181
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,278
What's wrong with
Harry Three-Eye?

182
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:10,482
Well, he might be
a little old-school for the humans.

183
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:12,550
Tell me,
sir, what was your card?

184
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:14,085
The three of spades?

185
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,256
Is this your card, my friend?

186
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:20,191
Whoa!

187
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,962
No, Harry's great.

188
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,164
Can't blame Harry
for the crowd not being hip.

189
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,333
Okay, what about Wayne?

190
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,001
Wayne? Are you nuts?
He's my boy.

191
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,970
Then maybe something
other than tennis?

192
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,172
Okay, so, what you wanna do

193
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,709
is lift the racket right on impact, so
you get that nice top spin.

194
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,244
Try and hit one.

195
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,022
What is that? What's the noise? It's on me!

196
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,991
It's just the cell phone I got you.

197
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:56,060
Clifton's sending you a text
so you can practice how to write back.

198
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,295
Oh!

199
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,031
Eh...

200
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,299
What the...
It's not doing it.

201
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:02,400
I got it.

202
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,007
Now you can text Clifton.

203
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,309
All right, fine.

204
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,078
How do you do this?

205
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,265
Maybe it's your fingernails.

206
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,715
It's easy.
Look. I'll text Mavis.

207
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:20,652
Psyched for date night.

208
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:22,987
See? And now look, she texted right back.

209
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,190
"Gotta cancel.
Can't leave Dennis."

210
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,125
Okay.

211
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,863
Are we never
allowed to be alone again?

212
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,733
I need to feel loved, too.

213
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,536
And send.

214
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,873
Okay. All that taught me
is that you're pathetic.

215
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,175
Yeah, got it.
Maybe you should just get Bluetooth.

216
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,544
Okay.
Blue Tooth, come over here.

217
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:50,915
So, now what?

218
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,689
Rise and shine, my Denisovich.

219
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,457
Hi, Papa.

220
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:02,861
Hello, my little devil.
Did you have sweet nightmares?

221
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:06,731
Uh-huh. I dreamed
that I saw a stegosaurus.

222
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,967
Oh... And were you
drinking his blood?

223
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,935
No.

224
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,270
Just throwing it out there.

225
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:13,805
Hey! You want to
do something cool?

226
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,441
Yeah!

227
00:16:16,507 --> 00:16:21,045
I'm going to teach you
how to turn into a bat. Like me.

228
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,947
- See?
- Cool.

229
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,649
Yes! Cool, like I said.

230
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,618
Now you try.

231
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm a bat.

232
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,055
I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

233
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:32,257
I'm a bat.

234
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,592
I mean, a real bat.

235
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,127
I'm a bat!

236
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:42,567
Denisovich. Take a breath.
You can really turn into a bat.

237
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,669
Try. Feel the bat.

238
00:16:47,038 --> 00:16:48,539
Not a chicken.

239
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,044
What's that?
The electric boogaloo?

240
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:55,980
If I show you I can bust a move,
will you try to fly, then?

241
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,047
Uh-huh.

242
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:13,731
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

243
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,100
Uh, he was sleep-dancing.

244
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,536
Come on, sweetie.
Back to bed.

245
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:21,539
"Back to bed"?
It's already after 8:00 p.m.

246
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,541
Don't you remember
the new sleep schedule?

247
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:24,509
He's going to human
classes half the day.

248
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:26,344
Uh...

249
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:29,414
If he could just sleep till 2:00 A.M. tonight,
it'd be so great for him.

250
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,416
But, honeydeath,
six of Wayne's wolf pups

251
00:17:31,482 --> 00:17:33,418
are having
a birthday party tonight.

252
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,586
You wouldn't want
him to miss that.

253
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:39,424
Dad, I love the wolf pups,
but they're a little too rough for Dennis.

254
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,726
"Too rough"?

255
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:43,795
Haven't you noticed?
Dennis is different.

256
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:46,664
What are you saying?
Denisovich shouldn't be around monsters?

257
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,968
I love monsters!
Video! Video! Ha!

258
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:52,136
Oh, you wanna show Papa Drac
your monster video?

259
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:53,203
Yeah!

260
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,209
Who's the coolest monster?

261
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:00,044
Kakie!

262
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:03,081
Wee! Kakie one happy monster!

263
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,683
Kakie love cake! Yummy!

264
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,086
Tummy get a tummyache.

265
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:11,522
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How is that a monster?

266
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,691
Have some cake,
Wuzzlelumplebum.

267
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:17,662
Remember, kids,
a real monster always shares.

268
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:22,533
"Shares"? Yes! When I think monsters,
I think "shares."

269
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,104
Now, let me tell you what a real
monster is, Denisovich.

270
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,774
Dad, please. He's practically five already.
Don't force it.

271
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,880
Slow down, Wuzzlelumplebum.

272
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:44,922
♪ Twinkle, twinkle,
little star How I wonder ♪

273
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:47,458
Mommy,
I'm too old for lullabies.

274
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:49,694
What?
That's not how that one goes.

275
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,329
This is the way
most people sing it.

276
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,598
"Most people"?
What's wrong with...

277
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:57,101
♪ Suffer, suffer,
scream in pain ♪

278
00:18:57,168 --> 00:19:00,538
♪ Blood is spilling
from your brain ♪

279
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,307
Daddy. Come on. You know
how I sang it to you.

280
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,511
♪ Zombies gnaw you
like a plum ♪

281
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,714
♪ Piercing cries
and you succumb ♪

282
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:15,253
♪ Suffer, suffer,
scream in pain ♪

283
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,358
♪ You will never
breathe again ♪

284
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,828
Still works.

285
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:45,149
Oh...

286
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:49,153
Happy birthday,
Wally, Wilson,

287
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,155
Whoopi,
Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

288
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,460
Denisovich! My big boy! You made it!

289
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,696
I thought about
what you said, Dad.

290
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,498
Maybe I was being
a little overprotective.

291
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,467
Thank you, coffin cake.

292
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,103
Dennis! I love you! Zing!

293
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:06,704
Hi, Winnie.

294
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:09,907
I just love your yummy strawberry locks!
Zing, zing!

295
00:20:13,077 --> 00:20:16,948
Winnie. Give him his space, hon.
I'm sorry, Mavis.

296
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:19,684
It's okay, Aunt Wanda.
They're just playing.

297
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,454
Holy rabies! Limbo?
I used to love that game!

298
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,356
Get in there, Mavey.

299
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,024
Really? But I'm a parent now.

300
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,459
Show 'em how it's done.

301
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,760
Okay. Okay, okay.

302
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,371
No way! A pinata?

303
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:45,977
Oh, Mavis, honey.
That's for later.

304
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:47,945
Whoo!

305
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:49,652
We don't want
the pups to have too much...

306
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,549
Candy!

307
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,152
Sugar.

308
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,897
I'm sorry.
Did I start all that?

309
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,003
Don't worry. There's a reason
they call it a litter.

310
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:18,842
Whoa!

311
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:22,113
Dennis! Are you okay?

312
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,081
I got a candy.

313
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,050
Look! Your tooth came out.

314
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:28,553
Are you kidding me?
He got his tooth knocked out?

315
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,656
Oh, yes, indeed.
Here comes the fang.

316
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:34,825
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang.
Why would this one be?

317
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:36,460
He's not a monster.

318
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:39,763
Ooh!

319
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:44,435
The sun's gonna come out soon,
and we gotta get to his classes.

320
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:48,239
What's wrong with the classes we have here?
Like the kids' yoga?

321
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:52,343
Yoga!

322
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,478
This is Denisovich's home.

323
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:56,080
I don't know, Dad.

324
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,515
What don't you know?

325
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:01,052
Well, we've been
talking about moving.

326
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:03,554
Somewhere safer
for Dennis.

327
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:06,524
Maybe where Johnny
grew up in California.

328
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,461
I'm sorry, but you can't just make
somebody something they're not.

329
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,065
Come on, honey.
We have to go.

330
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:15,333
Zing, zing?

331
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,270
Mavey, wait.
You can't mean that.

332
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,542
You're in on this?
The leaving?

333
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,445
Uh...
It's not definite at all.

334
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:28,713
It's just something
she's definitely talking about,

335
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,015
but until we do it,
it's not definitized.

336
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,420
Did he just cover
me with birdseed?

337
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,723
Yeah, he covered me.

338
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,769
Dad, it's not a fang.

339
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:54,972
Dad, I don't know
if it's the right place for Dennis.

340
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,674
Right, Johnny?

341
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:59,977
Oh, hey, dudeman.
It's not me. It's Mavey.

342
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:03,414
Hey, dudeman.
I'm afraid to say anything.

343
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,750
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

344
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:08,286
Uh, Drac? Who you talkin' to?

345
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:10,521
Do not disturb.
The count's wiggin' out in here.

346
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:13,824
What are you
wiggin' out about, Drac?

347
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:17,228
The kids. Mavey Wavey's saying
she wants to leave.

348
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,930
She wants to leave? What about Johnny?
He doesn't wanna go.

349
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:22,333
He's making the hotel
more human-y for Dennis.

350
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,168
You know, seeing
that he isn't a monster.

351
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,603
He is a monster!

352
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,737
He's just a late fanger.

353
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:27,838
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,440
And I could be a hand model.

355
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,742
Shut up!
It's all that human-y stuff

356
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,346
that's confusing
poor Denisovich.

357
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:38,549
So maybe you gotta get the kid
around more monster-y things. Ooh!

358
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,751
Oh, I need a cape.

359
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:43,921
I can't. She's always around,
checking up on me.

360
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:47,224
Man, if you could
just get some alone time.

361
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:49,660
Wait a minute.
That's what Johnny wants, too.

362
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:52,830
Alone time with Mavis.

363
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,801
Have they even had a vacation

364
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,369
since before
they were married?

365
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:05,609
They're going to now. And so are we.
Frank, you're a genius.

366
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:18,388
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,062
We'll take Denisovich
to all our old haunts.

368
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:28,364
Each of us will
show him our skills.

369
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:32,603
Teach him how to be a monster.

370
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,608
And he'll be
fanging it up in no time.

371
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:39,810
Boy turns five next week.

372
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:42,413
If he's not a vampire by his birthday,
it ain't happenin'.

373
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,715
Oh, it ain't
ain't happening, baby.

374
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:47,118
All he needs is
time with his vampa.

375
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:48,519
"Vampa"?

376
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,920
Vampire grandpa.

377
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:51,922
Come on, man.
That's obvious.

378
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,527
Johnny. Come outside.

379
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,929
What? Who is it?

380
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,499
It's your father-in-law.
I need to talk to you.

381
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,168
What's up?

382
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:05,903
Oh.

383
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,305
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

384
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:11,475
No problem-o.
I was kinda diggin' the attention.

385
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,514
Can they stay?
I don't think they're ready to leave yet.

386
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,716
Come on.
Go to your mother.

387
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:19,984
Look, you want
to stay here, right?

388
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,819
Of course.

389
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,555
This is the first place
where I can really be myself.

390
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:28,058
I haven't felt this alive
since they invented stuffed-crust pizza.

391
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:32,429
Well, then, we've got some work to do.
Okay, so here's the plan.

392
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,765
Maybe it's a good idea
to take her to your hometown.

393
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:37,067
But remember...

394
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:39,970
So, it's sliced avocado,
rolled oats with apricot,

395
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:42,339
the Aveeno
moisturizer after every bath.

396
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:45,709
And then the shea butter
on his tush before his PJs

397
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:48,479
and then 20 minutes
with the nebulizer

398
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,749
while I read his Learning Factory
Phonics book to him.

399
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,186
It's asking a lot, Dad.
We could just take Dennis with us.

400
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:58,122
What? Are you kidding me?
And get him off his routine?

401
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,490
No, no, no.

402
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,592
You kids go to California,

403
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,028
and see if it's the right place
to raise Denisovich.

404
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:05,863
And you remember
how to video chat?

405
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,233
Yes, yes. With the phone
and the buttons and the agony.

406
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,170
Thanks for being so understanding, Dad.
I know you'll keep him safe.

407
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:16,774
Of course, Mavey.
Stake my heart and hope to die.

408
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,742
I'm just gonna
miss him so much.

409
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,512
I love you, Dennis.

410
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,380
I love you, Mommy.

411
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:27,017
I'll tell him Mavey Wavey stories
every night before bed.

412
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:28,953
You're the best.
I love you, Dad.

413
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,859
Gonna miss all you guys.
You're all my family.

414
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,661
Love you, Drac.

415
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:40,030
Yes. I love you, too.

416
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:43,801
Now, remember the plan.
Just keep her distracted and happy.

417
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,303
But not too happy, capisce?
Got it.

418
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,906
Operation "Just Keep Her
Distracted and Happy,

419
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:52,276
"But Not Too Happy, Capisce,"
starts now. Cool?

420
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,811
Smiling on the outside.

421
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:54,979
Will you hug my backpack?

422
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,045
No.

423
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,455
Back to bed.

424
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,658
Ah, yes, we'll get to the bed.
We all love the bed.

425
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,994
But we're just gonna
do one thing first.

426
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,699
Is it shorts
weather where we're going?

427
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:18,435
Jeez. I hope not.
My body isn't swimsuit-ready yet.

428
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,771
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

429
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,107
Hey, can I have a second?
I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

430
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:24,808
Oh, brother.

431
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,444
I'm gonna miss you so much.

432
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:29,280
You know, you have to be strong, honey.

433
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:30,746
Because what we
have is unbreakable.

434
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,853
Babe, don't cry.
Everyone's looking.

435
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,521
Okay, I gotta call him on this.

436
00:27:37,588 --> 00:27:40,558
Just let him play it out,
get it over with.

437
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:45,095
Okay, you two lovebirds.
Drink your champagne and let's get going.

438
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:47,364
Oh, yeah.
No, sure. Okay.

439
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:48,431
Cheers, babe.

440
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:52,836
Oh. You klutz.

441
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,972
We can't say
nothin' about this?

442
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,399
No. We don't have
time for zingers.

443
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:08,319
How do you click in
the stupid car seat?

444
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,054
You gotta cut
those nails, man.

445
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,822
We just strap our
kids down with duct tape.

446
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,295
What's he doing here?

447
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:21,165
I told him he could come.
He's never been outside the hotel.

448
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:23,934
Blobby, there's no room.
Sorry, man.

449
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,305
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

450
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,008
Fine, put him on the Rascal.
Let's just get going.

451
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:37,648
Oh.

452
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:48,325
Where are we going,
Papa Drac?

453
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:50,794
Oh, Denisovich, we're going
to have an adventure.

454
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:53,030
A monster-y adventure.

455
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,966
Yay! Monsters!
We're gonna eat cake.

456
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:58,068
What did he say?

457
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,537
No.
No cake on this monster trip.

458
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:04,141
No cake, cebause Kakie says,
"Too much cake makes tummy ache."

459
00:29:04,475 --> 00:29:05,776
Yay!

460
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:07,277
"A monster always shares."

461
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,347
Wow!

462
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,750
We may need
more than a week.

463
00:29:12,816 --> 00:29:15,986
Hey, you know who
could fix the kid in a snap? Vlad.

464
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:19,523
What? We don't need to call Vlad.
We got this.

465
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,128
You see, Denisovich,
monsters are nice, just like you.

466
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:28,399
But when the moon comes out,
the real monster fun begins.

467
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:31,769
Being scary. Right, guys?

468
00:29:35,706 --> 00:29:37,066
Guys? Guys!
What is wrong with you?

469
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,145
Come on.
Everybody likes that song.

470
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:44,982
We're not everybody.
We're scary monsters. Remember?

471
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,283
Hey, what are you putting in?

472
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,818
It's an audio book.

473
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,988
Bigfoot's life story.
He reads it himself.

474
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,689
Chapter One.

475
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,156
Wow!

476
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:28,358
This is gonna be so amazing.

477
00:30:28,425 --> 00:30:31,462
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be so happy,
but not too happy.

478
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,963
Huh?
What?

479
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,299
I wanna see everything
you did growing up.

480
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:37,501
As long as you're distracted, capisce?

481
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:41,004
We can hit a few spots
on the way to my parents.

482
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,573
Lemme just quickly call home.

483
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,308
Ah! Don't do that.

484
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:47,177
It's only 1:00 A.M. there.
Dennis isn't even up yet.

485
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:50,514
Right. I'm just not used to
being away from him.

486
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,016
Everything's gonna be cool.
Your dad was so all over it.

487
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,119
I know. He's the best.

488
00:31:15,806 --> 00:31:17,107
Right turn, here.

489
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:19,943
Denisovich, rise and shine.

490
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:24,181
Boys, this bringing
back any memories?

491
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:27,518
We used to prowl around here
when we were in our 100s.

492
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,888
The Dark Forest of Slobozia.

493
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:41,932
Nice how they built it up.

494
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,168
Okay, out of the car.

495
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,770
Denisovich,
you're going to see

496
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,339
every monster
do his specialty.

497
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:53,043
First, Frank's gonna show us
how he scares people.

498
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,879
Yay! He's gonna say, "Boo."

499
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,415
Yeah, I don't
think "boos" ever work.

500
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:01,518
But that's why we're here.
To learn from the master.

501
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,388
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

502
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:22,606
Yeah, guess it just depends
on work.

503
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:25,776
Frankenstein!

504
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,911
Hey, how ya doin'?

505
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:31,081
You're awesome! Can we take a picture?
Is that okay?

506
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:33,150
Sure, okay. Little
selfie action.

507
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:35,418
For real?

508
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,621
Awesome! Thank you so much.

509
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:38,956
Hey, have a great day.

510
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,158
Boo!

511
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,360
Oh. He's adorable.
He's adorable.

512
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,362
Adorable, yes.

513
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:48,298
Not scary,
but "boo" is a start.

514
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,979
My birthday cake's gonna have
the coolest guy on it.

515
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:04,381
Let me guess. Kakie.

516
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:08,252
No. He's so cool.
He climbs walls and wears a cape.

517
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:11,288
Oh, really. And who
is this very cool guy?

518
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:13,023
Batman!

519
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,825
Batman. Great.

520
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,095
You don't know anyone else
with a cape that's cool?

521
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:19,263
This is good. Stop here.

522
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:28,705
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn.
Go kill something.

523
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:29,906
Denisovich, watch this.

524
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,208
What?

525
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,576
I told you, come on.

526
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,511
If we don't
inspire Denisovich,

527
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,546
how's he going to
find his inner monster?

528
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:37,948
Who's in a monster?

529
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:39,516
Nobody, just...

530
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:40,583
Here, have an avocado.

531
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:41,852
Yay!

532
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,920
Your mommy says
it's a good fat.

533
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:46,056
Whatever
the heaven that means.

534
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,091
Listen, I'm not gonna
set monsters back again

535
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:50,661
just to make your
grandkid like vampires.

536
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:52,847
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here.
It's all been...

537
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,467
Aw...

538
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:58,702
What a cutie.

539
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:00,904
But kill him.

540
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:04,574
Oh, great. You know
I haven't done this in years.

541
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,544
We don't need to kill anymore.
We have Pop-Tarts.

542
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:10,013
Denisovich,
you're going to love this.

543
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,983
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer,
and the next one's yours.

544
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,151
Wayne, go.

545
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:21,124
Oh, man. I'm too old for this.

546
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,493
Okay, how's it go again?

547
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:26,363
No, no, wait.
That's for the moon.

548
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,597
Oh, I growl. Right, here goes.

549
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:32,068
Growl!

550
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:33,135
Get it, boy.

551
00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:40,276
Get it, Uncle Wayne.

552
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,615
Some werewolf.
Did you actually say the word "growl?"

553
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:48,084
You're a werewussy.

554
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:49,486
I said I was rusty.

555
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,823
Gimme me that Frisbee.

556
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,324
No! It's my Frisbee!
I fetched it!

557
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:55,992
Give it to me!
Give it back!

558
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:58,528
Give it over here!
Give me that! Give it back!

559
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:05,802
He's fine.
He's Blobby.

560
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:11,475
This place is so
amazing and scenic.

561
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,709
What do you
wanna show me first?

562
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:14,077
Mmm. I don't know.

563
00:35:14,144 --> 00:35:15,579
It's pretty,
but there's really

564
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,047
nothing to do
once it gets dark.

565
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:18,515
Wait. What's that place?

566
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:25,222
So, you're telling
me that I can pick

567
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:26,968
between all these
different kinds of chips?

568
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:28,859
Yes.

569
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,694
How do people decide?

570
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,662
Whoa!

571
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:35,532
Now what's that
beautiful fountain of rubies?

572
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,702
Johnny,
have you tried this Slurpee?

573
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,771
Not that quickly, hon.

574
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:44,174
It comes in 48 flavors.
We have to try them all.

575
00:35:47,444 --> 00:35:49,179
Uh, I don't know
if we have time.

576
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,948
Why? This place is open
all night. Right, sir?

577
00:35:52,015 --> 00:35:53,015
Yes.

578
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:58,955
Johnny, look.

579
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:02,159
They're making a TV
show about this place and we're the stars.

580
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,527
Hello, world.

581
00:36:03,593 --> 00:36:04,995
Awesome.

582
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,665
It's totally awesome.
You're so lucky, Kal.

583
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,268
Hello, world.

584
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,673
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

585
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:21,578
Excuse us. Do you know where someone
can get a bite around here?

586
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:24,848
Did you seriously just ask a vampire
where to get a bite?

587
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:27,384
Oh, gosh. I didn't mean...
We're not from around here.

588
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,853
This is so embarrassing.
Just keep going.

589
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,855
Sorry to bother you.
Love your chocolate cereal.

590
00:36:35,392 --> 00:36:37,294
So, what do you
want me to do now?

591
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,062
Denisovich,
you won't believe it.

592
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:41,398
The mummy can
crash through walls

593
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,400
and turn into
a swarm of beetles

594
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,735
and put a curse on anyone.

595
00:36:45,802 --> 00:36:47,237
That sounds mean.

596
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:48,839
It's fun mean. Okay.

597
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:50,507
So, check it out.

598
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:55,111
Murray's going to conjure up
the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

599
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:56,847
Hit it!

600
00:36:56,913 --> 00:36:58,582
Sandstorm?
It's been awhile.

601
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:00,617
Not my problem.
Do it. Say your little spell.

602
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,386
Okay.

603
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:07,190
I got this. Frank, Wayne, Griffin,
just try not to faint.

604
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,245
Ow!

605
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:30,514
My back.

606
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:40,891
Oh. Wait.

607
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:48,899
How cute!

608
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,635
Ow! Ow!

609
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:59,242
Wait. Stop at that playground.
Look at these cute kids.

610
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:08,852
Holy rabies!
This looks like a blast.

611
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,287
I don't know, Mavey.

612
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:13,189
This can be pretty dangerous
if you don't know what you're doing.

613
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,925
Of course, I rock these bikes.

614
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:16,359
May I, little dude?

615
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:19,796
Check it out. Oh, yeah.

616
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,865
This is how I rolled every summer.

617
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,902
Whoo-hoo!

618
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:26,969
Whoa, whoa!

619
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:37,747
I think I scratched it.

620
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:38,815
Oh...

621
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:40,483
My turn.

622
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,486
Mavey, I told you,
it took me years to get this good.

623
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:45,522
Well, I'll give it a try.

624
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,364
You feel me now?
That's my girlfriend, suckers.

625
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,765
Your wife, Johnny.

626
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:30,533
My wife. Even better.

627
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,237
That was sick, lady.
Where did you learn how to do that stuff?

628
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:35,672
Transylvania.

629
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:39,009
That's cool. I have a cousin
from Pennsylvania.

630
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:42,779
Oh. These little guys are so sweet.
Dennis would love them.

631
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:44,547
What an awesome
place to raise a kid.

632
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:46,483
Oh. To raise a kid?

633
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,418
I don't know about awesome.

634
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:51,554
Maybe tubular. Capisce?

635
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,256
Anyways, we should
hit my folks' place.

636
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:54,190
I said we'd be there by now.

637
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:55,625
Sure.

638
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:57,827
Oh, hey, it's after
3:00 o'clock in Transylvania.

639
00:39:57,894 --> 00:39:59,796
I'm gonna check
on Dennis, okay?

640
00:40:04,801 --> 00:40:07,604
Chocolate cereal.
Are you kidding me?

641
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,806
It's okay, Drac.
It's 'cause they love us.

642
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,308
Yeah.
Monsters are what's goin' on.

643
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,477
Oh, yeah.
You should embrace it like I did.

644
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,513
I've got a best-selling workout video.

645
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:19,215
Follow me, ladies.
Right. And left.

646
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:21,951
No, girls. Watch me.
You're not watching.

647
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:24,954
Here we go. And eight
and seven and six...

648
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,723
That's not me, guys.

649
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,160
Come on, even Bigfoot's tearin' it up
in the German soccer league.

650
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,014
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

651
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,138
It's Mavis.

652
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:43,940
You gotta answer it.

653
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:45,542
You're pushin' too hard.
Lighter.

654
00:40:45,608 --> 00:40:47,644
All right!

655
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,647
Denisovich, wake up.
Oh, boy, he's out cold.

656
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,848
I got this.

657
00:40:54,617 --> 00:40:55,885
Dad, what took so long?

658
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:57,253
What?

659
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,623
Nothing, Mavey.
We're all great here at the hotel.

660
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,692
Just doing hotel things.

661
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:04,060
Sorry, can't handle your breath.

662
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:05,595
I hear ya.

663
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:07,130
How are you?

664
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:08,732
We're having a blast.

665
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:11,868
We just went biking and mini-marting.
It's so fun here.

666
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,037
Is Dennis okay?

667
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:15,338
Oh. Of course.

668
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,173
You want to see him?

669
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,042
Yes. Yes, I do.

670
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,410
Hi, baby. How are you?

671
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:22,045
Mommy.

672
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,112
I happy.

673
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,714
Aw.

674
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,483
Hey, little dude.

675
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:28,118
Why is he wearing sunglasses?

676
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:30,253
Oh, we were playing.

677
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,089
It's a superhero thing.

678
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:36,593
Cebause,
I'm Sunglasses Man, to the rescue!

679
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:38,261
Okay, take it down a notch.
I'm flying.

680
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:40,864
You sound funny.

681
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:44,000
Oh, no, no, that's his
Sunglasses Man voice.

682
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,803
Static. The signal is bad.
Mavis, are you there?

683
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:49,304
Yeah, I'm still...

684
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,176
All right.
I guess he's having fun.

685
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,944
Of course he is.

686
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:59,315
Wow, I nailed it
with the Sunglasses Man.

687
00:41:59,382 --> 00:42:00,984
Right off the top of my head.

688
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,019
I threw in a "cebause."
Did everyone see that?

689
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:05,855
She said she was having fun.
Johnny's blowing it.

690
00:42:05,922 --> 00:42:09,159
She's biking and mini-marting.
She's gonna wanna move!

691
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:12,061
I gotta fix this kid now.
Are we almost there or what?

692
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:14,030
Okay, I may

693
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:15,698
have taken a wrong
turn a few miles back.

694
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:17,567
Don't get mad.
What?

695
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:21,838
Someone turn on
the navigator on this thing.

696
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:23,873
Look how light I touch it.

697
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,876
Please enter your destination.

698
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,580
Please. I am begging you.

699
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:35,718
Yeah, this is gonna
be good, Denisovich.

700
00:42:35,785 --> 00:42:38,655
Scary stuff, okay?
It's in you.

701
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,491
We just gotta
concentrate on the scary.

702
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:44,327
Papa Drac?
Do you miss Grandma?

703
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,163
Miss Grandma?
Oh. Sure, I do.

704
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,501
I miss her every day.
She was my zing.

705
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:53,903
Why do you ask?

706
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,371
I don't know.

707
00:42:55,438 --> 00:42:57,407
Do you miss anybody?

708
00:42:57,473 --> 00:42:59,576
I miss Mommy and Daddy.

709
00:42:59,642 --> 00:43:02,412
And who else?
You miss that Winnie?

710
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:05,582
The pup who tackles you
and tries to lick you all the time?

711
00:43:05,648 --> 00:43:07,884
Yeah, but we're just friends.

712
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,753
Oh, no, no, no.
You're a Dracula.

713
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,624
You can't just be friends with a cute,
hairy number like Winnie.

714
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:20,296
Right turn, now!
Here. You imbecile!

715
00:43:20,363 --> 00:43:21,431
Oh, right. Turn, Griffin!

716
00:43:21,497 --> 00:43:22,665
Yes, Papa Drac.

717
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,542
Wait and see, fellas. This kid'll be guzzling
goat blood in no time.

718
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:35,979
- You have arrived at your destination.
- Yes!

719
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:37,847
Yes!
Here we are.

720
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:40,283
It's the vampire summer camp
I went to as a kid.

721
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,752
What's it, Camp Vamp?

722
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:44,888
No. Who names
their camp "Camp Vamp?"

723
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:47,123
It's Camp Winnepacaca.

724
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,412
You see, Denisovich?

725
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:13,549
This is where I learned
to catch mice and shapeshift.

726
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:17,287
And use my incredible powers and strength.
It's pretty cool. Huh?

727
00:44:17,353 --> 00:44:18,353
Badminton.

728
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:26,195
Yes, I don't
remember this badminting.

729
00:44:26,262 --> 00:44:29,232
Well, well, is this a night?
How ya doin', folks?

730
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,100
I'm Dana, the director.

731
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,636
We're sure excited to have you
legends visitin' us.

732
00:44:33,703 --> 00:44:35,672
What can I do you for?

733
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:40,476
Well, I'm very interested
in sending my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

734
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:45,014
Oh. This little redheaded,
non-fangy little guy?

735
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:48,551
Oh, they're in there. He's a late fanger.
That's why we came here.

736
00:44:48,618 --> 00:44:50,753
Can you show us
some of the drills,

737
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,889
like where they
catch the mice?

738
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,925
Can do.
A-course now we call it Tee-Mousing.

739
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,439
So they don't have
to catch the mice?

740
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:12,976
Nope. We find this is a good way
to build their confidence.

741
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:15,845
Come here.

742
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:18,906
It's right there!
What's the matter with you?

743
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:21,951
Hokey-pokey.

744
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:25,121
Ah!

745
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:28,558
There it is, Denisovich.
Where Papa learned to fly.

746
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:30,660
Ooh! I wanna fly like Papa.

747
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,266
Uh...

748
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,068
Yeah. We're over here, now.

749
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,972
Had to scale it down.
Insurance.

750
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:48,978
Help me. Help me. Help me.

751
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:51,981
Hokey-pokey.
See ya at the campfire.

752
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:59,489
Well, gosh! Welcome, you two.

753
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:00,723
Hey, gang.

754
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,660
Hi, guys. This is so exciting.

755
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:07,864
Ah!
Look at all of this. So cool.

756
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,466
Wow! I can't
believe I'm actually here.

757
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:11,834
Well, you are.

758
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:15,204
Now, how does it work?
Are you up all night and sleep all day?

759
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,572
Yeah.

760
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:17,640
Oh. I'll do
whatever you guys want.

761
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:19,242
Good.

762
00:46:19,308 --> 00:46:21,878
'Cause I bought this
pretty sunhat for you. Linda.

763
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:23,880
But otherwise this poncho,
if you wanna be safe.

764
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:25,715
We can deal with
it later, Linda.

765
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,716
Okay.

766
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,451
Oh! Come see.

767
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,320
I've set up your bedroom.

768
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,428
It's just like Transylvania.

769
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:41,964
Oh, Transylvania.
That was a fun experience.

770
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,100
Mike was afraid he'd get
disemboweled and eaten,

771
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,102
but I told him he
was just being silly.

772
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:47,809
That was you, Linda.

773
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:50,073
Oh. There they are.

774
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:52,909
You know, we have a couple
of mixed families in the neighborhood,

775
00:46:52,975 --> 00:46:54,877
so I thought I'd
invite them over.

776
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:56,979
They might be nice
for you guys to talk to

777
00:46:57,046 --> 00:46:58,781
since you're
thinkin' about moving here.

778
00:47:00,516 --> 00:47:02,652
Hi, Caren.
Hi, Pandragora.

779
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,220
Welcome, Mavis.
Hey, guys.

780
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:09,025
Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
Don't even worry.

781
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:12,428
People are totally cool
with our lifestyle choice.

782
00:47:12,495 --> 00:47:13,796
I mean, the kids get picked on a little,

783
00:47:13,863 --> 00:47:16,065
but it toughens them up.

784
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:17,932
Oh, hey, you guys.
And this is Loretta.

785
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,936
She's married to Paul,
who's a werewolf.

786
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:21,604
Excuse me?

787
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:25,108
Yes, I was telling Mavis about the other
monster-human couples in town.

788
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:27,009
I am not a werewolf.

789
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:29,679
Oh. I thought...

790
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,348
Well, you're welcome to stay
and have some cupcakes.

Great job, vampires.
Give yourselves a hug.

798
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:07,382
Mmm...

799
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:13,456
We're going.

800
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,523
What? Where?

801
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,331
Why are we doing this?

802
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:25,201
You'd rather be listening
to those putrid new songs?

803
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,303
What happened to Michael Row
Your Corpse Ashore?

804
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,939
Or Old McWerewolf Had An Axe?

805
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:37,180
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

806
00:48:37,246 --> 00:48:39,248
Who's ready to fly?

807
00:48:39,315 --> 00:48:41,517
Me! Me! Like a superhero.

808
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,386
Better! Like a vampire!

809
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,222
This thing is rickety.

810
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:48,591
You know what?
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

811
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:51,928
Quiet. This is how they learn.
You throw them and they figure it out.

812
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:54,463
It's how I was taught.

813
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,898
I wanna fly now!

814
00:48:55,965 --> 00:48:59,302
Attabat. You know Papa's right here
if you need him.

815
00:48:59,368 --> 00:49:00,803
Uh. I can't watch this.

816
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,371
Please don't.

817
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:04,907
Here we go!

818
00:49:04,974 --> 00:49:05,974
Wee!

819
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:12,515
He's still not flying.

820
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,583
He will.

821
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:16,385
Still not.

822
00:49:16,452 --> 00:49:17,452
It'll happen.

823
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:19,989
This is a tall tower.

824
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:21,524
That's why it's good.

825
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:22,858
You should get him.

826
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:23,993
He's gonna fall to his death.

827
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,928
He's taking his time.

828
00:49:27,396 --> 00:49:28,898
Drac!

829
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,866
I did that my first time.

830
00:49:30,933 --> 00:49:32,535
He's getting too
close to the ground!

831
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,338
You know what?
He's not gonna fly.

832
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:43,913
Ah.

833
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:48,985
I told you.
Papa's always here for you.

834
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:51,320
Again! Again!

835
00:49:51,387 --> 00:49:54,056
Oh, dear. Oh, my devil.
We're gonna have to report this.

836
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:55,691
You mean to the papers?

837
00:49:55,758 --> 00:49:59,128
I guess it was pretty cool,
but I'm not about getting press.

838
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:01,664
No, sir.
I mean the authorities.

839
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:04,166
I can't not report
child endangerment.

840
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:07,003
Whoa!
Listen to me. That was fun.

841
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:09,438
Your singing is
child endangerment.

842
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:11,507
Should we go
down and help him?

843
00:50:11,574 --> 00:50:14,410
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He's on his own.

844
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:15,978
We have to call
the boy's mother.

845
00:50:16,045 --> 00:50:17,580
No, that ain't happening.

846
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,216
His mother's
already nutsy koo koo!

847
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,885
I have to follow protocol.

848
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:26,522
You will not follow protocol.

849
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:28,524
I'm a vampire.
I can't be hypnotized.

850
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:30,526
Right.

851
00:50:30,593 --> 00:50:33,095
Now, please. Don't
make me call the police.

852
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:34,964
No one's calling nobody!

853
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:37,899
Aah!

854
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:39,502
Fire!

855
00:50:39,568 --> 00:50:42,371
Stop, drop and roll.
Stop, drop and roll.

856
00:50:42,438 --> 00:50:43,773
Screaming's not helping!

857
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,839
Yay!

858
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:54,250
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

859
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:55,884
Bad?

860
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,456
No. You're
the best kid in the world.

861
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:03,859
We didn't start the fire.
It was the tower.

862
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:08,397
That's a very unsafe tower.
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

863
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:10,266
Let's go, my hero.

864
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,069
Cebause I'm Batman!
To the Batmobile!

865
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:14,637
Yes. To the...

866
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:28,751
Sorry about all that stuff.
I guess they thought you'd like it.

867
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:30,920
Why do I feel so weird here?

868
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:33,122
No, hon. They're being weird.

869
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:35,591
I think they're
just trying to help me.

870
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:39,128
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing
living inside that hotel.

871
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:42,131
And you learned about everything
growing up in Santa Claus.

872
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:44,667
Santa Cruz. But, uh...

873
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,503
Maybe if Dennis grows up
away from Transylvania,

874
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,540
he won't be so freaky.
Like me.

875
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:55,077
Are you nuts?
Mavis, you're a blast.

876
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:57,980
You're so full of life
and curious about everything.

877
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,282
If Dennis grows up
to be just like you,

878
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:02,451
I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.

879
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:05,588
I love you, Johnnystein.

880
00:52:05,654 --> 00:52:06,989
You know what?

881
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:09,959
As long as we're all together,
we'll be happy anywhere.

882
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,494
Even at the hotel.

883
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:14,263
Yes!

884
00:52:16,732 --> 00:52:18,067
What are you doing?

885
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:20,603
Check out this
video my friend sent me.

886
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:22,671
This kid is
an awesome daredevil.

887
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,907
Ah.

888
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:25,875
Oh, dude!

889
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:27,009
Did you get it?

890
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:28,310
Wait! Is that Dennis?

891
00:52:28,377 --> 00:52:33,082
- No! Is it? No. It's just hard to see.
- But...

892
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:35,651
Oops. Just deleted it.
So, it's gone.

893
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:48,297
What? It's Mavis.
I'm not answering it.

894
00:52:50,332 --> 00:52:52,301
Come on, Drac. You have to.

895
00:52:54,904 --> 00:52:56,572
All right!

896
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,140
Yes, honeybunch.

897
00:52:58,207 --> 00:52:59,809
Dad? Where are you?

898
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:03,846
Um... We're outside the hotel
having a little cookout.

899
00:53:03,913 --> 00:53:05,548
It's perfectly safe.

900
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:07,149
What's that noise?
Is that a siren?

901
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:10,386
Oh, those are just
some wailing banshees checking in.

902
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,254
Quiet, you banshees.

903
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:15,057
We're trying to have a perfectly safe
cookout over here.

904
00:53:15,124 --> 00:53:18,727
Mommy!
I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

905
00:53:18,794 --> 00:53:20,229
Papa Drac just tried
to teach me how to fly.

906
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:21,730
Wait a minute.
Is that the mother?

907
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:23,232
Oh, no. Static again.

908
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,435
I am coming back to
the hotel right now.

909
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:30,606
And you better be there or I swear, Dad,
you're gonna be very sorry.

910
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,375
What's goin' on?

911
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:34,677
We need to get
home right away.

912
00:53:34,743 --> 00:53:35,743
Whoa!

913
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:39,782
Okay.
I'll go wake up my backpack.

914
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,383
Guys, we gotta move.

915
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,819
We got no car!
How we gonna get out of here?

916
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:45,387
Don't worry.
I made a call.

917
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:57,867
I'm sorry, Blobby.
We really meant to call you sooner.

918
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:05,641
Hit it!

919
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:22,057
Transylvania.

920
00:54:22,124 --> 00:54:23,459
You want to go where?

921
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:24,894
Transylvania.
As soon as possible.

922
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,962
We don't fly
direct to Transylvania.

923
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,397
You don't?

924
00:54:28,464 --> 00:54:30,666
You can go to Bucharest,
but you'll have to

925
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:32,568
switch planes in
Chicago and then Zurich.

926
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:34,303
So, when would we get there?

927
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,373
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed
due to bad weather.

928
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,547
So, two seats in coach?

929
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,980
No!

930
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:47,950
- No!
- Yes.

931
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,040
You have to go now?
When we finally have no traffic.

932
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:12,708
You're killing me, Blobby.

933
00:55:22,718 --> 00:55:25,721
I still have some cloud on me.
Gotta do a selfie!

934
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,289
Johnny! Not now!

935
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:28,591
Okay. Maybe later.

936
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,399
This scooter thing's out of juice.
We're never gonna make it.

937
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:38,901
Frank, blow.

938
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,445
Now!

939
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:15,537
How fun is this?
Why are you laughing? You like that?

940
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:16,872
Watch this.

941
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:20,114
Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!

942
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,552
Now this is flying,
Denisovich.

943
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,755
Like a vampire.

944
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:35,223
Wee!

945
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:39,128
That's my boy. Look at you go.

946
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,540
You're the coolest guy
who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

947
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:04,919
Ugh!

948
00:57:20,235 --> 00:57:22,938
So, hey, when are you going
to get here already?

949
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:24,606
We've been waiting...

950
00:57:26,642 --> 00:57:28,777
Give me my son.

951
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:31,213
We just went out
for some avocados.

952
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,748
Mommy! I flew!

953
00:57:32,815 --> 00:57:34,450

Now I don't even feel like
he's safe around you.

964
00:58:03,579 --> 00:58:04,747
But I was just...

965
00:58:04,813 --> 00:58:06,181
What was it you said?

966
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:09,651
Human, monster, unicorn.
That it didn't matter?

00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:11,854
Well, I just know his life would...

Then we're moving.

970
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:19,194
Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

971
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:22,397
Maybe you've let humans
into your hotel, Dad.

972
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:24,633
But I don't think you've let them
into your heart.

973
00:58:56,398 --> 00:58:57,398
Hmm...

974
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:11,780
I can do it.
I can do it.

975
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:15,784
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

976

I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat!

977
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,521
Dennis?
What are you doing, sweetie?

978
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,757
Uh... Nothing.

979
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,827
Careful. Let me help
you down from there.

980
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:26,995
Are you getting
excited about your big party?

981
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:28,864
I guess so.

982
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:31,867
You know who's coming?
Daddy's whole family.

983
00:59:31,934 --> 00:59:34,169
Grandpa Mike
and Grandma Linda.

984
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:37,973
All your cousins and aunts and uncles
who love you so much.

985
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,044
And then they're gonna be with us
when we move to California.

986
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:46,682
Mommy, are we going away
cebause I'm not a monster?

987
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:50,285
What?
No. Dennis, of course not.

988
00:59:50,352 --> 00:59:52,888
It's just grown-up stuff.

989
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:55,524
Okay.
But what about Papa Drac?

990
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:58,126
He's gonna be here all alone.

991
00:59:58,193 --> 01:00:01,096
Papa Drac has to stay
here to run the hotel.

992
01:00:01,163 --> 01:00:03,699
But he'll visit us.
And we'll visit him.

993
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:05,300
Can we call him every night?

994
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:06,902
Sure.

Kakie.
What a wussbag.

Isn't it nice to have
the whole family together?

1010

Mavis, do you have any cousins or
thingies in your family?

1011
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,761
No. It's just been me and Dad.

1012
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:08,463
I never did ask how
you lost your mom.

1013
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,532
Oh. She was
killed by angry humans.

1014
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:11,767

Oh, you have a grandpa?

1018
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,287
Yeah. He'll be at the party.
I invited him.

1019
01:01:21,743 --> 01:01:23,779
You invited him?

1020
01:01:23,845 --> 01:01:27,649
Dad, he's never seen Dennis.
I wanted them to meet once before we go.

1021
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:31,987
Sure.
Great. Peachy. Good old Vlad.

1022
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:34,022
Anybody have a wet wipe?

1023
01:01:51,873 --> 01:01:56,178
Holy rabies.
He finally invites me to something.

1024
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:57,679
He's got a grandkid?

1025
01:01:57,746 --> 01:01:59,514
And he never told you?

1026
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:03,919
Easy, Bela. At least there's
another vampire in the family.

1027
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,555
It's at a hotel?
Fancy schmancy.

1028
01:02:06,621 --> 01:02:09,725
Hotels are for humans!

1029
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:17,599
Bela, shut your blood hole.
Look what you started.

1030
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,601
Don't worry, gang.

1031
01:02:19,668 --> 01:02:22,938
I raised my son to hate and kill
and steal the souls of humans

1032
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,073
like a good boy.

1033
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,410
Yes,
Grandpa Vlad will be so happy

1034
01:02:28,477 --> 01:02:32,814
when he sees the big masquerade party
Johnny and I have planned.

1035
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:34,016
What?

1036
01:02:37,552 --> 01:02:39,187
Play along.
It's my dad.

1037
01:02:39,254 --> 01:02:41,023
You have a dad?
That's funny.

1038
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:43,492
Listen to me. My dad cannot
know you're a human.

1039
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:45,761
Or any of your family.

1040
01:02:45,827 --> 01:02:48,263
What? But, Drac,
I'm proud that we're...

1041
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,099
Or he'll steal your family's souls
and eat your backpack.

1042
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:55,203
That's right, gang.

1043
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:58,206
We're gonna make the birthday
a monster masquerade party.

1044
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:01,376
Really?
Oh, that's lovely.

1045
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:05,914
Sort of like a last hurrah before Dennis
gets to be with normal people.

1046
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:08,016
I couldn't have
said it better.

1047
01:03:27,702 --> 01:03:31,339
What do you think, Mavis?
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

1048
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,980
You're lucky we don't
call the authorities.

1049
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:40,949
Let's go, my hero.

1050
01:03:41,016 --> 01:03:42,517
Cebause I'm Batman!

1051
01:03:43,718 --> 01:03:45,854
Yes! To the Batmobile!

1052
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,880
Got your butt kicked by a girl, Batman.

1053
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:58,834
Yeah. Whatever.
I'm not about to cry.

1054
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:05,707
Hotel Transylvania.

1055
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:09,244
I smell humans!

1056
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:12,280
Tear it down!

1057
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:16,885
Bela, we're in the outside world.
You're gonna smell humans.

1058
01:04:16,952 --> 01:04:20,489
You know what? Just wait outside for me.
This is family stuff.

1059
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:22,157
You'll only get in the way.

1060
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:24,025
I just wanna meet
the little fanger.

1061
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,560
He should know
his great-vampa.

1062
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:27,295
His what?

1063
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:30,565
Vampire grandpa. Come on.
That was obvious.

1064
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,769
Amazing party!

1065
01:04:34,836 --> 01:04:37,672
So, what do you think?

1066
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:40,242
This is your vampire costume?
What are you, nuts?

1067
01:04:40,308 --> 01:04:41,776
I ordered it online.

1068
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:43,745
It was the only place
that delivered overnight.

1069
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:46,214
You look like you got
a baboon's butt on your head.

1070
01:04:46,281 --> 01:04:48,216
Have you at least
practiced your voice?

1071
01:04:48,283 --> 01:04:50,285
You can't just
talk like a hippie.

1072
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:51,987
I'm not a hippie.
I'm a slacker.

1073
01:04:52,053 --> 01:04:54,422
Talk like a vampire.

1074
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:59,995
My name is Count Jonafang.
I am a vampire.

1075
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:03,698
Okay, vampires don't go around saying,
"I am a vampire."

1076
01:05:03,765 --> 01:05:08,136
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1077
01:05:08,203 --> 01:05:09,604
Are you kidding me?

1078
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:11,139
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

1079
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:13,308
Yeah, listen,
if you think I don't like it,

1080
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:15,310
you definitely
don't want to say,

1081
01:05:15,377 --> 01:05:17,145
"Bleh, bleh-bleh,"
in front of my father.

1082
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:18,647
Sir, Master Kakie
has arrived.

1083
01:05:18,713 --> 01:05:20,448
Oh, hey.

1084
01:05:20,515 --> 01:05:23,418
Drac, this is Brandon, a.k.a. Kakie.

1085
01:05:23,485 --> 01:05:25,487
We got him for Dennis.
Hey, man.

1086
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,556
Nauseated to meet you.

1087
01:05:27,622 --> 01:05:29,958
When does this happen?
I got a book fair in half an hour.

1088
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,198
All right. Where's my vampson?

1089
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:42,037
Oh, please. Still has to make
a dramatic entrance.

1090
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:44,739
Dad! Look at you!

1091
01:05:44,806 --> 01:05:47,242
So you run a hotel now?

1092
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:51,079
From Prince of Darkness
to King of Room Service.

1093
01:05:51,146 --> 01:05:53,215
Yes. So good to see you.

1094
01:05:53,281 --> 01:05:55,116
I'll be right with you.

1095
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:03,225
Keep Vlad away from
the humans and Mavis.

1096
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:05,260
I'm on it.

1097
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:09,664
Oh, now that is
a neat costume.

1098
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:12,200
These two smell funny.

1099
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:13,868
Oh, you're European.

1100
01:06:13,935 --> 01:06:16,504
It's called deodorant.

1101
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:19,608
Nothing like insulting
an entire continent, Linda.

1102
01:06:19,674 --> 01:06:21,743
Hey, Count!
How goes it? Frankenstein.

1103
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:23,979
Actually, I'm technically
Frankenstein's monster.

1104
01:06:24,045 --> 01:06:25,445
Frankenstein,
he's the doctor who...

1105
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,883
Would love to hear more.
Call my people.

1106
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:31,350
So, let me introduce you
to some of your son's other buddies.

1107
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,922
This is Murray.

1108
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,657
Please don't kill me!

1109
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:38,526
I mean, yo, V! What's up?

1110
01:06:38,593 --> 01:06:41,396
Talking toilet paper.
Well, that's a new one.

1111
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:45,033
All right! Where's the kid?
That's who I wanna meet.

1112
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,334
Johnny!

1113
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:52,107
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

1114
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:56,011
I am Count Jonafang.

1115
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:58,480
Bleh, bleh, black sheep.

1116
01:06:58,546 --> 01:07:01,516
Have you any wool?

1117
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,418
What's that
thing on your head?

1118
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:05,854
Looks like my
grandmother's boobies.

1119
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,592
Daddy, who's the man
with the funny face?

1120
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:11,860
Is this the kid?

1121
01:07:11,926 --> 01:07:13,094
It sure is.

1122
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:14,796
Let me see those fangs.

1123
01:07:14,863 --> 01:07:16,097
What are you doin'?

1124
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:17,999
Oh, I just love him so much.

1125
01:07:18,066 --> 01:07:21,036
I want to hug him
right in the fangs that he has.

1126
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,608
I repeat,
lemme see those fangs.

1127
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:39,387
Oh, he's a late fanger,
just like you.

1128
01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:41,690
Yes. Yes.
Just like me.

1129
01:07:43,925 --> 01:07:46,628
The big shot here
was a little crybaby, all right.

1130
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:47,963
Yes, yes, I was.

1131
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:49,130
Used to pee in his bed.

1132
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:50,665
Okay, Dad.

1133
01:07:50,732 --> 01:07:53,535
We just need to
scare the fangs out of the kid.

1134
01:07:53,601 --> 01:07:55,236
Hare ha hangs?

1135
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:57,972
Yeah, it's what I did
for Mr. Tough Guy here.

1136
01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:00,542
First, you've got
to possess something

1137
01:08:00,608 --> 01:08:03,044
the late fanger
finds sweet and innocent.

1138
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:04,713
Then you show them
what's what and...

1139
01:08:04,779 --> 01:08:06,781
Pop!

1140
01:08:06,848 --> 01:08:10,952
Trust me. It'll scare
the fangs right out. Right, Drac?

1141
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:14,389
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for the
book fair, I'll miss the street fair.

1142
01:08:15,256 --> 01:08:17,592
That's your guy.

1143
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:20,462
Possessed?
But Dennis will be so upset.

1144
01:08:20,528 --> 01:08:22,630
Don't you get it?
This is our ticket.

1145
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:25,500
If it works for Denisovich,
boom! He's a vampire.

1146
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:27,402
And you all get to stay here.

1147
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:29,137
All right. All right.

1148
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:32,107
Capisce.
Good call.

1149
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:35,210
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

1150
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:37,712
Dennis has a big
surprise for you.

1151
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:42,117
The one and only Kakie,
The Cake Monster!

1152
01:08:42,183 --> 01:08:46,121
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

1153
01:08:46,186 --> 01:08:49,524
What a wonderful
Kakie day it is!

1154
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:53,427
Now, I have a question.
Who here loves cake?

1155
01:08:58,933 --> 01:08:59,933
Rise!

1156
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:01,735
Whoa, whoa...

1157
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:11,079
Why am I floating?
Can I have the stage manager, please?

1158
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:12,913
This isn't working for me.

1159
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,980
Whoa...

1160
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:19,487
Wow!

1161
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:22,657
Scary, Denisovich?
You feeling anything? Any change?

1162
01:09:22,724 --> 01:09:24,159
Is Kakie okay?

1163
01:09:26,528 --> 01:09:30,632
I want all the cake.
Sharing is for cowards.

1164
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:36,738
I don't remember any of this
from the TV show.

1165
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,641
Um... I think I saw it
on a Blu-Ray disc, bonus stuff.

1166
01:09:39,707 --> 01:09:41,810
Wait, why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

1167
01:09:48,283 --> 01:09:50,784
I'm scared, Papa.
What's happening to Kakie?

1168
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:58,927
You don't eat cake.
Cake eat you!

1169
01:09:58,993 --> 01:10:00,428
No!

1170
01:10:00,495 --> 01:10:01,596
Stop it!

1171
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:07,936
What just happened, man?
I'm outta here.

1172
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:11,339
None of these parents
better review this on Yelp.

1173
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:13,208
Hey, what did you just do?

1174
01:10:13,274 --> 01:10:15,743
A few more seconds and the kid's fangs
would have popped right out.

1175
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:17,345
I don't care.
It's not worth it.

1176
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:19,380
What's not worth it?

1177
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:22,851
It was my last attempt
to make the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

1178
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:25,887
By ruining his favorite thing?
How could you do that?

1179
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:27,021
We were desperate.

1180
01:10:27,088 --> 01:10:28,957
You were in on this?

1181
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:30,458
Dennis won't be
happy in my town.

1182
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:32,293
Dennis hasn't been there.

1183
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,629
♪ Now husband and wife ♪

1184
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:36,731
♪ Feel the strain
and the strife ♪

1185
01:10:36,798 --> 01:10:38,500
Shut up!

1186
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:40,768
Johnny,
Dennis is not a monster.

1187
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:44,339
He likes avocado.

1188
01:10:44,405 --> 01:10:45,907
'Cause you don't let
him eat anything fun.

1189
01:10:45,974 --> 01:10:48,142
I think Dennis just
wants to be normal.

1190
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:50,545
Can we stop using
the word "normal"?

1191
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,881
Where we live now,
he's normal.

1192
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:56,718
He is who he is.
And you can't change him, Dad.

1193
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:01,127
Dennis, where are you going?

1194
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:02,524
Away.

1195
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:06,694
But it's not safe
out here by yourself.

1196
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:09,731
I know a place where
we can hide. Follow me.

1197
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,639
If you didn't stop me,

1198
01:11:17,705 --> 01:11:20,808
my great-grandson wouldn't
have to be a wimp his whole life

1199
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:22,477
like Schlumpy over here.

1200
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:24,412
A wimp?
Johnny, be cool.

1201
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:26,548
You wanna throw down, old man?

1202
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:28,249
Certified yellow
belt since 1997.

1203
01:11:28,316 --> 01:11:30,485
No!

1204
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,654
What's this now?
You're not a vampire?

1205
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,223
Bleh?

1206
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:39,460
Of course he's human. He's our son.
You think we're monsters?

1207
01:11:42,997 --> 01:11:47,802
You! You let your daughter marry a
human and have a human kid?

1208
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:51,039
Why don't you just
put a stake through my heart.

1209
01:11:51,105 --> 01:11:54,242
We don't hate humans anymore,
and they don't hate us.

1210
01:11:58,012 --> 01:11:59,914
Humans?

1211
01:12:01,349 --> 01:12:02,750
You're a fool.

1212
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:05,486
Your great-grandson is
the sweetest, kindest,

1213
01:12:05,553 --> 01:12:08,323
most special
boy I've ever met.

1214
01:12:08,389 --> 01:12:10,458
And if you can't
give him the love

1215
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:12,226
he deserves
because he's half-human,

1216
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:13,628
then you're the fool.

1217
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:16,163
Oh, Daddy.

1218
01:12:18,499 --> 01:12:19,901
Hey, where is Dennis?
Dennis!

1219
01:12:21,169 --> 01:12:22,169
Dennis?

1220
01:12:25,506 --> 01:12:28,476
Happy birthday, Dennis.
I made you a treat.

1221
01:12:28,543 --> 01:12:30,745
Dead pigeon?
Enjoy it.

1222
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:33,581
'Cause once I graduate business school
and start running a company,

1223
01:12:33,648 --> 01:12:36,517
you're not gonna get
home-cooked meals like this anymore.

1224
01:12:36,584 --> 01:12:39,954
I have to move away, Winnie.
To California.

1225
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:42,790
My mommy thinks
I'm not happy here

1226
01:12:42,857 --> 01:12:45,326
cebause I don't have
hair on my face like you.

1227
01:12:45,393 --> 01:12:47,795
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

1228
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:51,232
No, you are perfect.
You're the nicest boy I know.

1229
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:53,267
And I have 300 brothers.

1230
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,403
You're nice, too, Winnie.

1231
01:12:59,674 --> 01:13:05,013
Well, well, well.
The little human and his pet.

1232
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:06,881
Dennis!
Denisovich!

1233
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:08,149
He's not in the room.

1234
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:09,684
He's not by the pool.

1235
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:11,386
He's not in this pot of soup.

1236
01:13:11,452 --> 01:13:13,421
Where could he be?

1237
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,657
I don't know why I
ever invited you.

1238
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:17,992
Dennis!
Dennis!

1239
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:19,059
Denisovich!

1240
01:13:19,093 --> 01:13:20,093
Dennis!

1241
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:34,308
Stop squirming.

1242
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:36,377
Why are you doing this?

1243
01:13:36,444 --> 01:13:38,413
Because this is wrong.

1244
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,815
Why doesn't anybody get that?

1245
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:43,985
Humans don't
belong with monsters.

1246
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,353
You're wrong!

1247
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,821
I am not!

1248
01:13:46,888 --> 01:13:49,724
I am holding you hostage.

1249
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:54,962
And me and my crew are gonna
tear that human-hugging hotel to shreds.

1250
01:13:55,029 --> 01:13:56,531
You can't.

1251
01:13:56,597 --> 01:13:58,266
Really? Why not?

1252
01:13:58,332 --> 01:13:59,534
Cebause...

1253
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,735
Cebause, why?

1254
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:04,839
Cebause it will
make Papa Drac sad.

1255
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:08,676
Ooh... Sad. And what are you
gonna do about it?

1256
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:10,745
I don't know.

1257
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:12,780
You know why you don't know?

1258
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:16,984
Cebause you're just
a weak little boy.

1259
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:48,983
What was that?

1260
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,618
Dennis, we're coming.

1261
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,988
Are you okay, Winnie?

1262
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:55,423
Yes, my zing.

1263
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:32,960
Dennis!
There he is, right there.

1264
01:15:33,027 --> 01:15:34,462
Dennis! Baby!

1265
01:15:34,529 --> 01:15:36,063
My big boy!

1266
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,265
Dennis,
we were lookin' for ya.

1267
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:38,633
Sweetheart.

1268
01:15:38,699 --> 01:15:39,699
I'm so happy to see you.

1269
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:44,806
There's his mean friends.

1270
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:53,581
Oh... This'll be fun.

1271
01:16:06,594 --> 01:16:07,628
Whoo!

1272
01:16:27,014 --> 01:16:28,015
Huh?

1273
01:16:54,575 --> 01:16:55,943
I didn't do that.

1274
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:09,123
You rock, Dennis.

1275
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,291
He means Denisovich.

1276
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:11,626
Kakie rules!

1277
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:23,804
Dennis, I'm coming. Whoa...

1278
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:31,112
I knew all that
practice would pay off.

1279
01:17:55,269 --> 01:17:57,605
That's right,
you better fly away.

1280
01:17:59,173 --> 01:18:02,710
Papa Drac, I'm
a vampire and a superhero.

1281
01:18:02,777 --> 01:18:04,645
Am I cool now?

1282
01:18:04,712 --> 01:18:08,215
"Now"?
Dennis, you were always cool.

1283
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:12,987
Human, vampire, unicorn,
you're perfect no matter what.

1284
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:16,357
But since I'm a vampire,
can we stay here?

1285
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:18,426
Yes.

1286
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:19,660
All right! Yeah!

1287
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:20,828
All right!

1288
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:27,201
But you have to know,
we're going to visit you here every holiday.

1289
01:18:27,268 --> 01:18:29,270
That's fine.
That's fine.

1290
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:39,747
Aah!

1291
01:18:45,052 --> 01:18:48,990
Don't ever come near
me or my family again.

1292
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:53,661
No!

1293
01:19:02,837 --> 01:19:06,774
Daddy, you just
saved a human.

1294
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:09,176
All this pressure about

1295
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:11,612
when the boy's
fangs were coming out.

1296
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,949
Who cares? Mine came
out years ago! Look.

1297
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:20,021
Okay, Dad, put 'em back
in before we all barf.

1298
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:23,691
Hey! Isn't it still
somebody's birthday?

1299
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:21,348
Let me hear you sing!

1300
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:24,819
I didn't do that.
