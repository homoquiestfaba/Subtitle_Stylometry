1
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:36,715
Congratulations, Joe.

2
00:00:36,748 --> 00:00:39,452
I don't know how you pulled it
off my brother.

3
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:41,455
-Sebastian Case.
-Who?

4
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:43,557
Remember Alfonso Rafael?

5
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:45,526
Federico Sebastian.
The waiter.

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,629
Guy was a major gun runner.

7
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,631
You should have seen the
stockpile.

8
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,767
I knew he wasn't as goofy as

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,736
he looked. Anyway,
you're getting it easy

10
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:56,039
man. Five weeks paid vacation.

11
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:58,075
I'm stuck out here on patrol.

12
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,811
Look who's here.

13
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,182
-Hey, stranger.
-Hey.

14
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:06,218
Can I steal you away?

15
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:08,699
-Absolutely, bro.
-See you later.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,424
See you tomorrow
you two lovebirds.

17
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,359
Don't get into any trouble,
but if you do,

18
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:14,429
name it after me.

19
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:24,625
I can't believe I have you to
myself for a whole month.

20
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,679
You know what I'm thinking?
A tropical island

21
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,849
-getaway.
-Maui.

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,252
Towel outs. Tahiti

23
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,154
-Micronesia.
-Yes. The South Pacific. Yes, I love it.

24
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:37,157
Please. Come on.

25
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:43,465
Thank you mister.

26
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,434
-You're welcome sweetheart.
-Wow, you're

27
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,370
-pretty.
-Thank you.

28
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:53,578
Do you think, if we
maybe had a couple

29
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,614
little samurais in a row.

30
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,584
Maybe soon.

31
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:01,754
Love you, Joe.

32
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,861
You know, Jennifer,
it's always been kind of

33
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,162
awkward for me to say this, but

34
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,299
I just want you to know

35
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:12,335
that after all these years
together, I...

36
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:14,471
Officer, my sister is missing.
You gotta help.

37
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,405
I went to go get her ice cream
and when I came back, she

38
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,543
-was gone.
-Alright kid, calm down.

39
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,612
Where is she? Where
did you see her last?

40
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:22,681
She's got brown hair.
It's tied in a pony tail.

41
00:02:22,713 --> 00:02:24,683
She's wearing all pink.
Come on. You gotta hurry.

42
00:02:24,717 --> 00:02:26,753
She's by the trees over there.

43
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,166
Jen!

44
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,334
Take care of yourself.

45
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,305
No, no, no.

46
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,473
No, no, no.

47
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:45,443
No, no, no, no!

48
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,412
No!

49
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,121
No, not tonight.

50
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:10,090
I don't feel so hot.

51
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,059
What's the matter my love?

52
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:16,099
Things are changing.

53
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:17,051
What is?

54
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:22,539
The times. I had to approve
a district plan today.

55
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,575
You wouldn't understand.

56
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:26,810
The district plan to

57
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,813
allow the inner universal trade
treaty with shinjuku?

58
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,782
Yeah, they gave me the money.

59
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:34,888
So, I, had to do it.

60
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,923
Katana might kill me for this.

61
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:39,026
Up until tonight, you're

62
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,995
pretty loyal to the Katana,
weren't you?

63
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:43,132
Yes, I was.

64
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,401
And I if I don't get caught,

65
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,438
I might have dodged
a clan war between

66
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,439
the Katana and the Shinjuku.

67
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:53,545
Which you inadvertently started?

68
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,582
Relax.

69
00:05:57,616 --> 00:06:01,688
I have something just
what you need.

70
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,791
What is that?

71
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:05,894
Don't worry. It will be gentle.

72
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:07,829
It will send you somewhere
far beyond

73
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,864
the universe.

74
00:06:11,968 --> 00:06:14,004
Relax.

75
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,618
I love you too.

76
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,588
My father is the
Katana's top general

77
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,658
enforcer, Tadishi Wakanaga.

78
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,727
He found me in the streets

79
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,763
as a baby and
raised me as his own.

80
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,732
I am his Katana blood.

81
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,871
I'll kill you!

82
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:51,485
To tell you the truth,
so what?

83
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:53,185
You're heading
toward the freezer.

84
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,978
I've grown soft in my old age.

85
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:47,287
I've spent the past twenty years
rebuilding this organization.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,255
We are now well respected in
our own home country.

87
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,325
What is the matter, godfather?

88
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:55,631
We may have reformed,
but our enemies have not.

89
00:07:55,663 --> 00:07:59,870
The Shinjuku
have infiltrated us.

90
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:04,042
We are about to lose everything
we worked so hard to build.

91
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:06,110
We knew this day would come.

92
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:08,146
-He has returned.
-Joe Marshall?

93
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,318
That's impossible.

94
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:14,622
You are mistaken I believe.

95
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,357
Do not talk to your
elders like that, Dogge.

96
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,659
Hey!

97
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:22,731
In this room, Dogge Chan
is a junior CEO.

98
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,766
She has the floor.

99
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,936
How did you know he has risen?

100
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,939
After all these years?

101
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,942
It was a vision.

102
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,180
In a foretold dream.

103
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,182
A vision?

104
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,285
In a dream?

105
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,354
And you,

106
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,357
did you have such a vision?

107
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:45,660
No.

108
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,762
But I felt it in my bones.

109
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:51,867
The storm is coming and the
evil one will rise again.

110
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,771
What is the meaning of all
this? Who is the evil one?

111
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:57,909
If you speak again,
I will slice you.

112
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:00,012
An ancient prophecy in his
family.

113
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:02,015
Joe Marshall is
an evil creature.

114
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:06,119
One of us will be chosen
to fight and defeat him.

115
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:08,221
If Marshall returns, our rivals
with side with him

116
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,190
-like they did before.
-For every Messiah,

117
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:12,292
there is an opposite.

118
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:14,330
I have fought Joe Marshall.

119
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:18,367
You must defeat him, and
bring peace to our country.

120
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,340
Do you take this
directive of honor?

121
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,744
It's my destiny.

122
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:31,850
The passion burns like a fire
that I have never felt before.

123
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:38,059
The honor is mine.

124
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:44,267
The planets, the stars, the universe.
I have watched your dinosaurs

125
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,204
operating under your
sickening fear of human

126
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:50,508
instinct instead of cosmic forces
which guide us.

127
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:59,753
The planets show me mine
because I am the chosen one.

128
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:02,790
Hello. Red Eye Night Club?

129
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:05,960
Bye.

130
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:15,039
Shit.

131
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,242
Are you ok?

132
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,413
-Yeah.
-Did I work you out that much?

133
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:24,416
You need to get back
in shape baby.

134
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,787
You work too much.

135
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:30,424
All that bang bang shit goes
straight to the gut.

136
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,903
It's amazing how much asian technology
has advanced in 25 years.

137
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:43,106
So much has changed,

138
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,144
but everything's still the same.
We still get everything from

139
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,082
holy wars to petty crime.
Nothing really changes.

140
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,217
People don't change.

141
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,289
Looks like you had a long
weekend, hey Frank?

142
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,425
-What?
-A dead senator.

143
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,430
So what do you think?

144
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:07,837
Wow. That is a rare
Katana medallion.

145
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,909
Wasn't it you and
that other guy, Marlo

146
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,946
-that stopped him?
-It's Marshall, Joe Marshall.

147
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:16,882
You know, this is the third
murder this month.

148
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,920
They were Japanese, Ginza clan.

149
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:23,090
Wow, so you think,

150
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:26,094
we have a Yakuza clan war on
our hands between

151
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:29,164
Ginzas and the Katanas?

152
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:32,101
We need to take a trip together.

153
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:35,105
Yeah.

154
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:53,529
Ladies and gentlemen,
I propose a toast.

155
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:59,935
To our honorable master,
Kitano!

156
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,106
It has been a win fall,
Leonard.

157
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,043
A big fat win all around.
For years, we've been

158
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,148
the underdogs, but no longer.

159
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,150
With the new inter-universal
treaty, we will have

160
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:15,122
full reign of the New American
northwest.

161
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:18,093
Railways lines will be ours,
finally.

162
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:24,133
And we have begun
a new operation.

163
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:28,119
You speak when I tell you to!

164
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,549
This doesn't look so good. You
should have never let her so much.

165
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,481
-You know how she gets.
-Me?

166
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:42,490
-Was supposed to be guarding her.
-I'm a woman.

167
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:54,972
-Let's show the mother fucker!
-Go!

168
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,180
-Shinjuku!
-Long live the Shinjuku!

169
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,648
What is the meaning of this?

170
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,252
The Moloch has risen.

171
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:09,448
I am the elected one
who has delivered.

172
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,262
I will eliminate all your atoms
and molecules.

173
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:16,266
The land of opportunity
is for everyone.

174
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:20,604
-It's wake up and play.
-The Katana has risen!

175
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:25,409
Surrender to Katana!

176
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:59,386
Very hard.

177
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:24,751
Punk bitch.

178
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:31,325
Ok, girls. Lunch time.

179
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,466
Avenge me!

180
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:40,471
I shall!

181
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:49,649
As god as my witness,
I will avenge you!

182
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:08,371
That's the master Katana's

183
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:11,477
VP, as I'm sure you
know, and Leonard

184
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:15,161
my partner, we are the
co-owners of this club.

185
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,378
You going to take my statement?

186
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,374
Was your buddy involved in
any Katana business? Hakuza?

187
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,893
Ginza? Guzu?

188
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:28,477
I'll take over from here,
alright?

189
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,327
-Please, Gail.
-Remember, you're not supposed

190
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,724
-to be on this case.
-Gail, please,

191
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,540
if anyone knows anything about
Oriental culture and their operations,

192
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,743
-you know it's me.
-I know.

193
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:41,782
I took them down before.

194
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:43,221
I know!

195
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,318
Why do you make it
so hard for yourself?

196
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,556
Frank, please.

197
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,493
Let's not go there.

198
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:02,458
What do you mean I'm not
officially on the case?

199
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:06,535
-Captain, you need me on this case!
-You on this case?

200
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:09,076
I need you on this
case like I need fleas

201
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:13,462
-circling my asshole.
-This has the Katana stank all over it.

202
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:14,922
I know they're back.

203
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:18,729
And with the body count rising,
it won't be long before

204
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,695
they Shinjuku and
the Ginza retaliate.

205
00:16:22,696 --> 00:16:24,459
Yeah, and where's your proof?

206
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:27,402
What makes you think you have
enough evidence, dick head?

207
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,092
You read the witness statement. You know
the beating was tied to the Shinjuku.

208
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:35,756
We do not have a statement
from the owner.

209
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,078
I was there, man.

210
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,817
You were there does not
constitute a statement.

211
00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:43,858
Now look. File the rest of your
paperwork and get the

212
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:47,263
hell out of here?
Go, go, go. Out!

213
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:49,831
-Ail's hair. No, go, go, goodbye.
-Yes, sir.

214
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:56,006
This is not a capital tone.

215
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,278
Jesus.

216
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,349
Dammit.

217
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,582
Hey, Frank! About
those medallions.

218
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:03,724
I got you a list of japanese artistsans
who specialize in these engravings.

219
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:06,695
Tokugawa Shogunate, late
nineteenth century

220
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:09,832
Do these look familiar?

221
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,902
I have a graphic memory.
I've seen these medallions.

222
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:16,040
In the living room of
a very close friend.

223
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:19,010
These medallions were
crafted by a local artist.

224
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:22,349
Named Yasuhiro Morikawa.

225
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:25,352
The distributor buys and sells
online. So, I couldn't get

226
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:28,355
an office address but I tracked
delivery services

227
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:31,092
and got you a location.

228
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,434
Yeah, Harmon

229
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:40,103
-owes you a raise Bobby.
-Yeah.

230
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:46,611
GPS systems is not working.

231
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:49,649
I don't know if I'm on the
right track or not.

232
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:52,685
Morikawa. Morikawaba.
Whatever this

233
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:55,622
guy's name is. Where is he?

234
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:01,831
What is this place. Jeez?

235
00:19:01,864 --> 00:19:04,800
God. Look at all these
contraptions.

236
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,990
What the hell is this?

237
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:14,032
This doesn't look like a medallion
factory. Morikawa, are you here?

238
00:19:14,723 --> 00:19:16,540
Anybody here?

239
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:19,759
Hello.

240
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,717
Morikawa.
Morikawa, are you here?

241
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,673
Morikawa, where are you?

242
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:29,632
What's with this music?

243
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,769
Where's it coming from?

244
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:35,872
Morikawa, where are
you? Are you here?

245
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:38,810
Anybody home?
Morikawa, where are you?

246
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,847
Anybody here?

247
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:54,464
I know you've
been looking for me

248
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,667
Washington. So, that's
what you've been doing.

249
00:19:57,701 --> 00:20:00,637
Hiding out in Buddha land, while the
rest of the world has gone to shit.

250
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:03,674
Actually, it's more
Shinto than Buddhist.

251
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:06,644
Masters of Japan like
to hand pick the best

252
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:09,039
-aspects of their culture.
-Masters in Japan.

253
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,414
-My ass.
-That's a nice hello, Frank.

254
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,756
Good to see you, Joe.
There's been a string of

255
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:18,860
murders. It has
a smell of Katana.

256
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:21,830
The Shinjukus and Ginzas are
involved. Look familiar?

257
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:28,138
They should. I made them.

258
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:31,142
-Where is all this Morikawa?
-Yasuhiro Morikawa

259
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:34,146
is a pseudonym for
Joseph Marshall.

260
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:37,250
So he's not japanese either.

261
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:40,152
-You're such a fraud Joe.
-Hey.

262
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:46,629
So go to hell and
leave me alone.

263
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,532
Just give me the facts, Joe.

264
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:55,806
There were eight engravings.

265
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,809
Based upon the eight
virtues of the samurai.

266
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:02,015
Right, right, the Bushido code.

267
00:21:02,048 --> 00:21:04,984
They were sold to a private
collector. Master Kitano.

268
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:08,088
Who was murdered two nights ago.

269
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,125
You are gonna come with me
downtown. This gang

270
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:14,129
-is about to turn nuclear.
-I foresworn violence, Frank.

271
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:17,167
I no longer live by the sword.

272
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,270
What about the code?
The code of

273
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:23,574
justice and courage and honesty?

274
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:26,745
Aren't they part of your code?

275
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:29,782
-So you were paying attention.
-You were a hero man.

276
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:32,886
When you disappeared,
people lost faith.

277
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,855
Now the world is a bit more
complicated. Come on man.

278
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:38,961
-What do you say?
-I have no stake in this

279
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:41,897
fight, Frank. Just let
me exist in peace.

280
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:44,835
You abandoned me man.

281
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:45,810
I got you covered, Joe.

282
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:52,052
What the hell

283
00:22:52,086 --> 00:22:55,221
was that? I don't know.
I don't know, Joe.

284
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:58,125
You tell me. It's your medallions
showing up at all these murder scenes.

285
00:22:58,158 --> 00:23:01,196
It's either they're
coming after me

286
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,268
because I'm getting
close. Too close.

287
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,303
Or they're gunning after
you to stop you from telling

288
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:10,308
-me something.
-What do I have to tell you?

289
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,379
I don't know man? All I know

290
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:16,717
is I just think
the deeper I dig,

291
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:19,453
I just get this feeling that
this is all connected to Jennifer's

292
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:22,489
death 25 years ago and
I just need your help.

293
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:25,761
-Please, come on.
-You need my help?

294
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,898
I came to you twenty-five years

295
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,935
ago. When I was following up
all my clues and all my

296
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:35,005
leads, trying to find out who
killed my wife,

297
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,943
and all I asked you to do is get
me the file on Captain Roma's desk

298
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:41,046
from internal affairs. You
turned your back on me.

299
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:44,016
Some of us don't have the
luxury of being a rogue cop.

300
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:47,121
We go by the book,
and I'm a by the book

301
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:50,090
brother. Last time you
and I were up against

302
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:52,994
this Katana gang, you
had no problem being judge

303
00:23:53,027 --> 00:23:56,165
jury and executioner.

304
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:59,103
I'm getting too old for this.
I'm tired.

305
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:02,172
But I'm not washed up.

306
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:08,347
Just partner with me
man. One last time.

307
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:11,418
Help me out. I promise you we
will re-open the case and find

308
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,421
out who killed your wife and
then you can reign down

309
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,391
your deadly vengeance.

310
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:20,362
Ok, partner.

311
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:26,469
Let me grab my gear.

312
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:48,198
Empty plane. I like it this way.

313
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,367
Never been on a plane before.

314
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:54,404
No, shit. A worldly man like you?

315
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:57,441
I don't travel much.

316
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,620
My god.

317
00:25:06,654 --> 00:25:09,991
Mr. Washington. Mr. Marshall.

318
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:13,062
How nice to see you around
after all those years.

319
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,266
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Mr. Sebastian.

320
00:25:16,298 --> 00:25:19,269
I heard they cleared you of all
those charges a few years ago.

321
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:22,306
-Including that gun running beef.
-Yes.

322
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:25,376
I turn around my life. Now,

323
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,280
I'm an honest
member of the society.

324
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:31,552
Here I am.

325
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,521
-Anything to drink? I'll have a vodka.
-Vodka, sir.

326
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:37,591
-Thank you.
-How about you, Mr. Marshall?

327
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:40,663
-Kombucha, please.
-Kombucha.

328
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:43,966
That is a very expensive...

329
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,971
How about a
camomile ice tea, please.

330
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,974
Camomile ice tea.
Right away, sir.

331
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,011
What's that shit
you're drinking?

332
00:25:53,044 --> 00:25:56,016
It relaxes me, after
what you've done.

333
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:59,019
-What I've done?
-The exact violence

334
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:02,089
I told you I want no part of.

335
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:05,160
Hey mister, do you want to buy
some cookies?

336
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:08,096
-No, thank you, sweetheart.
-How about some kale chips, mister?

337
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:11,134
-I'm fine.
-Shut up girls.

338
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:14,171
This is not a free
trade zone here.

339
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:23,242
Dude! I'm gonna kill your fucking
ass if you don't shut up right now.

340
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,453
Does your office
have to put us side by side

341
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,657
on this flight for four hours?

342
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,593
I would have been perfectly happy
looking at the back of your head.

343
00:26:32,627 --> 00:26:35,966
Now, that's the Joe I'm used to.

344
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:38,736
Hey, what if I asked the captain
to grant you a temporary pass

345
00:26:38,768 --> 00:26:41,604
see. You do good,
you're back on the force.

346
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:44,976
No.

347
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,981
Alright, ok.
Whatever you say.

348
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:51,184
Mr. Washington.

349
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:54,154
Here's a gift for you.
Congratulations.

350
00:26:54,187 --> 00:27:00,261
My name is Alfonso
Frederico Sebastian.

351
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:04,331
The black gift.

352
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:21,622
Let me guess. You
want to know what

353
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,792
-book I'm reading.
-No.

354
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:27,696
Actually I was wondering
what that device is.

355
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,029
This?

356
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:34,172
This is so I don't have to carry twelve
heavy books every time I get on a plane.

357
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,207
-It's my entire library.
-Excuse me, um,

358
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,245
have we met somewhere before?

359
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,149
I don't think so.
What's your name?

360
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:46,186
Joe.

361
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,256
Joe. I'm Milena.

362
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,293
-And what do you do Joe?
-I'm a...

363
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:55,397
Follow my plan.

364
00:27:55,431 --> 00:27:58,435
The time is now. Kill them.
Do it. Kill them all!

365
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,720
I'm confused.

366
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:16,690
Are we on the same side?

367
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,655
Let's go back to the office.

368
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,793
What the hell was that?

369
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:47,797
I have no fucking idea.

370
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,911
Did you recognize
anyone on the plane?

371
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:03,350
No.
Name.

372
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:06,453
-Milena Roberts. Occupation.
-Art broker.

373
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:09,591
-What kind of art?
-Oriental antiques.

374
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,560
-Where do you get your art from?
-Private collectors.

375
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:14,787
-Are you married?
-No.

376
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:16,603
-Boyfriend?
-No.

377
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,055
-Relation?
-No.

378
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,305
-How do you explain?
-Frank,

379
00:29:20,306 --> 00:29:24,744
she's been through a lot. This
is turning into an interrogation.

380
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:31,284
She could use a little
peace and comfort.

381
00:29:31,318 --> 00:29:33,955
Can you come back
tomorrow and talk to us?

382
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:35,361
Yes.

383
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:43,299
-Can I take you home?
-Yes. Thank you, Mr. Marshall.

384
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,523
-Hey, guys. You staying out of trouble?
-Yeah, man.

385
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:05,661
-Been sober for five months now.
-Good for you.

386
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:08,465
Hey, you gotta stick with dude.
He'll get you cleaned up in no time.

387
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:11,567
Is that right?

388
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:17,775
Those guys really
look up to you, Frank.

389
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:20,880
I do my part.

390
00:30:20,912 --> 00:30:23,916
Hi, Frank. The usual.

391
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:27,020
Good. Hey baby girl,

392
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:30,025
-ou bring your old lady out here?
-Sure.

393
00:30:30,057 --> 00:30:33,395
You're really
turning into a cliche.

394
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:36,433
-Sure is good though.
-The last time you saw

395
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:39,402
-the inside of a gym.
-Man, I'm just as fit as I was

396
00:30:39,435 --> 00:30:42,540
when I first joined the force.

397
00:30:42,572 --> 00:30:45,443
I don't care if there is an
import on sashimi

398
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,447
we have a party of fifty
tonight.

399
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:51,030
-My god, Joe!
-Peggy.

400
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:52,157
How are you?

401
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,296
Hannah, get out here.

402
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:58,307
Are you my daddy?

403
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:06,903
-So you're running this place now?
-Well, someone's got to, Joe.

404
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:09,951
-Lly good to see you again, Peggy.
-Well, I hate to rain

405
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:12,796
on this happy reunion, but
we need some inside dirt.

406
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:15,490
Of course. It's the only
reason Washington ever

407
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,973
-comes to see me.
-The only reason?

408
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:20,679
Let's just say that long stakeouts
are a thing of the past.

409
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,546
-So, what do you need?
-What can you tell me about

410
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:27,942
-the Red Eye Night Club?
-Only that the Shinjukus

411
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:31,011
now lost their leader and
key man, Master Kitano.

412
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:34,283
It's a real shame. I remember
when he helped us out

413
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:37,516
with the Katana gang. He even
convinced the Ginza heads

414
00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:40,250
to turn state evidence, but the
Shinjukus weren't Kamikaze

415
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:43,000
like the Katanas.
They had more style.

416
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:45,734
They hid in plain site
like cameleons.

417
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:48,612
They've been really quiet recently
until the inner universal

418
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,103
treaty was granted to them.

419
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:52,529
How would that have effected
the Katana stature?

420
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:56,065
Under the treaty, the Katana's

421
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:58,935
chance of survival is like an ice
cube in a thousand degree oven.

422
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:02,006
Shit. Thousand degrees?

423
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,077
Looks like the Shinjuku
gang got re-armed.

424
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:08,148
With the
Shinjuku Kitano's death,

425
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,419
could be looking at
a full out clan war.

426
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:14,488
-Who's next in line?
-His son.

427
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:17,559
Goes by the name of Linton, but
he's a real enigma.

428
00:32:17,592 --> 00:32:20,529
-E really sees or hears from him.
-We'd better get going.

429
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,534
You're staying for lunch.

430
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,537
How about a glass of Romo Wine?

431
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,607
Now this is a reunion.

432
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:32,745
Cheers.

433
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:35,848
The horror.

434
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:51,135
No!

435
00:32:51,168 --> 00:32:54,205
No!

436
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,513
It's not fair!

437
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,761
He cannot be gone!

438
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:18,868
No!

439
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,730
You have no right accusing me
like this. You're the one who's

440
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:43,833
-responsible.
-Me? Are you fucking kidding me?

441
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,297
Take some fucking responsibility
for once you, bastard.

442
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:48,396
Bastard?
How dare you say that?

443
00:33:48,397 --> 00:33:53,044
-I'll come for you. I got my eyes on you.
-Sit your fucking ass down.

444
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:56,149
Right now and god dammit, don't
threaten me. I swear to god

445
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:58,953
you fucking owe me. You just wait
until the organization arrives.

446
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:01,955
You're scaring me.

447
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,994
Hey!

448
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:08,098
Hey! Knock it off!

449
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:14,104
Knock it off! Knock it off
you imbecilic clowns!

450
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,542
Madness, just madness.

451
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:20,246
I know I'm going to be
crucified for this, but

452
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,621
-welcome back, Joe.
-Thanks, captain.

453
00:34:26,654 --> 00:34:29,657
You're gonna need this.

454
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,661
That's alright.
I got all I need.

455
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,766
It's good to finally see you
guys

456
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:38,803
together again. I've been
looking forward to this

457
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:41,872
-magnificent day.
-Don't look so surprised, Marshall.

458
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:47,880
-I mean, people recognize mediocrity.
-Marshall?

459
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:51,018
Marshall, my god.

460
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:54,121
Hey, how are you? Cashew?

461
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:57,191
-No, thanks.
-I love my nuts.

462
00:34:57,224 --> 00:35:00,296
Anyway, here is
the file of the last

463
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:03,333
three murders, ok, and if
you're dealing with the Yakuza,

464
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,187
watch your back. You don't
have to remind me of that.

465
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,555
Do we have the needed intel
if the Ginzas are involved?

466
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:10,758
That's really funny.
That you should ask because

467
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:15,317
Roger Takahara of the Ginza
biotech. He arrived today

468
00:35:15,318 --> 00:35:18,044
in LA for a summit.

469
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,892
Ginzu knives. I
own several myself.

470
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:27,830
They make good
stocking stuffers.

471
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:30,935
Ginza.

472
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:34,138
Ginza.

473
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:37,241
Looks like it's time for you
and I to set up some

474
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:40,212
surveillance. Now,
that's what I'm talking about.

475
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:43,216
Now boys, look,
I'm going to expect

476
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:46,353
some results. Alright, alright,

477
00:35:46,386 --> 00:35:49,323
alright folks, don't let the
door hit you in the ass.

478
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:52,193
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

479
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,336
It's madness.

480
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:01,271
It's just madness.

481
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:10,785
Fujiyama son.

482
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:13,788
Our Tokyo attack
squad came back dead.

483
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,825
Joe Marshall has
rejoined the force.

484
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:22,933
Eliminating Shinjuku leader
Kitano was a success and we know

485
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:25,903
Takahara has arrived
in Los Angeles.

486
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:32,110
-The time to strike is now.
-Have patience, Dogge Chan.

487
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:35,181
We have been patient
for 25 years.

488
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:38,152
We have no choice
but to move forward.

489
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:44,225
The fire is burning now. Please,
let me take care of Ginza Takahara.

490
00:36:44,258 --> 00:36:47,330
-The victory should be ours.
-I want him dead.

491
00:36:47,363 --> 00:36:50,300
I want him more than dead.
I want his death to be

492
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,437
a lesson, an example
to all the clan.

493
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,474
Everywhere! That no Katana
will be pushed around

494
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,478
-or threatened with our honor.
-I will make you

495
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:02,449
proud and prove that
your lessons have been

496
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,519
profound and proficient.

497
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:08,489
I can handle it.
I've warned the Ginza

498
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,794
nothing will stop me!

499
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:14,797
Enough. We have
much ahead of us.

500
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,834
Now, I am tired.

501
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,837
I must get some rest.

502
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:47,986
Disappoint love.
I just lost one.

503
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:51,243
You dirty bird.

504
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:54,313
Hello.

505
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:57,317
Tina, the happy beaver.

506
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,458
It's the complex.

507
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,595
I know how to get
to the complex.

508
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:09,867
-Ave to give me that information.
-No.

509
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,904
Hannah, you do. I need
to have that information.

510
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:15,574
-No, you don't understand.
-You need to tell me.

511
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,544
I can't. I won't.

512
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:49,984
Jennifer!

513
00:39:08,204 --> 00:39:11,309
-Smells great.
-One thing that I'm really

514
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:14,414
good at is whipping up a
fantastic meal

515
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:17,218
-for a beautiful girl.
-Well, thank you.

516
00:39:20,421 --> 00:39:23,358
So, how's my cooking?

517
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:26,395
Good. It's good.

518
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,540
You're blushing, Joe.

519
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:33,546
I just can't get over how comfortable
and familiar I feel with you.

520
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:42,020
So, what do you
want to do today?

521
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:44,685
We can go shopping.
We can see a movie.

522
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,722
Maybe take in a winery.

523
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:50,626
It all sounds good.

524
00:39:55,688 --> 00:39:58,947
By the order of Shinjuku,

525
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:02,745
by the law of Shimura
Hashimura alliance,

526
00:40:02,746 --> 00:40:05,730
you Mister Ross saw the benefits

527
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:11,186
are here by the order to commit
harry carry for the crime of

528
00:40:11,187 --> 00:40:17,648
murder our Shinjuku minister
Regime Azacazu.

529
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:27,538
AKA Tyler Kimbell.

530
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,641
Please. Have mercy.

531
00:40:30,674 --> 00:40:33,679
You don't understand.

532
00:40:33,713 --> 00:40:36,750
They're going against you.

533
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:43,124
The Katana is going
after all of us!

534
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:46,061
And they brought the warrior.

535
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:49,099
Him!

536
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,239
Hlm!

537
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:01,247
No!

538
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:37,902
You know Milena,
have you ever thought about

539
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:40,872
-going blonde?
-Blonde?

540
00:42:40,904 --> 00:42:43,942
For a change.

541
00:42:59,462 --> 00:43:02,399
Got eyes on the Katana.

542
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:05,570
Are you sure it's them?

543
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:08,506
No, not really.
You wanna take a look?

544
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,611
Namu myoho renge kyo.

545
00:43:11,644 --> 00:43:14,648
Namu myoho renge kyo.

546
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,817
Namu. Is there a problem?

547
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,821
Right now I'm glad we're
not gonna pull an all nighter.

548
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:23,792
-Namu myoho renge kyo.
-Come on.

549
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:26,729
Come on. Take a look.

550
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,808
They're here.

551
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:38,811
I'm going in.

552
00:43:38,845 --> 00:43:41,982
Hey.

553
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:45,018
You're gonna need this.

554
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:48,022
Thanks partner.

555
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,605
I wanna talk to you!

556
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,576
Frank, can you hear me?

557
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,641
I'm on the roof.
Where are you?

558
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:09,549
Yo answer me. You're gonna
get killed. Get out of there.

559
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,547
Joe! Joe!

560
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:59,479
Frank.

561
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:02,415
-Can you hear me?
-I got you covered, Joe.

562
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:05,485
Copy. I'm going in.

563
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:27,012
Would you care for
some kale chips sir?

564
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:30,083
Fresh from the well-paid
employees at our factories in

565
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:33,420
-Portland Washington.
-Portland Washington?

566
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:36,458
I think you better study
your pacific northwest.

567
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,562
Joe, I have definite
confirmation that

568
00:45:39,594 --> 00:45:42,632
Dogge Sakamoto was
spotted near the Red Eye.

569
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:45,636
Just before the Katana murder
and know she's eyeing

570
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:51,744
Roger Takahara of the Ginza clan's
enforcer, Lauren Kimura.

571
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:53,146
Hey there, what
can I do for you?

572
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:54,915
-Ey there, what can I do for you?
-One kabuto, please.

573
00:45:54,948 --> 00:45:56,970
And some kale chips.

574
00:45:57,059 --> 00:45:59,560
Sure you wouldn't like
something stronger?

575
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,009
You know, they say if
you drink that stuff

576
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,855
you'll live longer. I
just say it feels longer.

577
00:46:03,856 --> 00:46:05,184
Because it tastes like shit.

578
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:08,122
It's like being married to
the wrong woman, right?

579
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:10,129
My first wife for example.

580
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:15,649
Married almost 8 years until it
feels like 8 minutes, underwater.

581
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,608
But I got a great wife
now. My second wife.

582
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:19,209
She's great.
Got a couple kids.

583
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:22,464
You know how kids are. Always got their
hand out right? Money, money, money.

584
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:24,665
Give me money. Alright.

585
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,680
I'm gonna go clean up

586
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:31,120
some glasses and give me a
shout if you need anything.

587
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:33,266
Pleasure chatting.

588
00:46:40,805 --> 00:46:43,149
My, my.

589
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:46,979
Who might you be?

590
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,050
Joe. Joseph Tinen.

591
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:55,319
-I'm with the Katana office.
-Katano's dead.

592
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,006
Old news. I'm sure
you know who I am.

593
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:05,392
Dogge Sakamoto,
junior vice president

594
00:47:05,393 --> 00:47:08,946
of Tokyo Robotics Incorporated.

595
00:47:08,947 --> 00:47:12,387
You see that man over there?

596
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:16,927
He's not a good man.
He's corrupt.

597
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:27,130
I have a secret, Mr. Joe.

598
00:47:28,968 --> 00:47:33,305
Something big
is about to happen here.

599
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:36,274
And you cannot escape.

600
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:45,854
Do me a favor.

601
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:48,857
Don't keep it warm.

602
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:58,069
Milena.

603
00:47:58,102 --> 00:48:01,040
-What are you doing here?
-Happy birthday, Joe.

604
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:04,009
-Wow.
-Do you like it?

605
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,748
Takahara, this is the land of
opportunity and freedom and yet,

606
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:16,359
you insist on taking the freedom
and opportunity from the Katana.

607
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:19,328
You have lifted us
out of existence.

608
00:48:20,813 --> 00:48:21,706
Joe!

609
00:48:21,707 --> 00:48:25,452
Answer me! Answer me!
You're gonna get killed.

610
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:28,990
I'm the queen of death.
Look at me, you mother fuckers.

611
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:31,036
Go kiss your ancestors.

612
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:34,011
Kill them all! Kill them all!

613
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:58,374
I'm gonna get us out of here.

614
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:52,140
-Hirohito.
-What?

615
00:50:24,819 --> 00:50:27,090
Joe and Milena, I got your back.

616
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,696
It sure ain't like

617
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,904
-the old days.
-Amen to that.

618
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:40,251
-Feels like a club up my ass.
-Let's get out of here, partner.

619
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:55,825
What is that?

620
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:58,894
No, I can't.

621
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:02,065
Is that the map?

622
00:51:02,097 --> 00:51:04,968
It is the map. It's the
map to the complex.

623
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:08,072
The complex?

624
00:51:08,105 --> 00:51:11,110
-You need to give me that map.
-No, no.

625
00:51:11,144 --> 00:51:14,080
No. I must not.

626
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:29,400
The plan is moving forward.
All elements

627
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:32,269
are in place. Joe Marshall
is in love with me.

628
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:35,441
Poor fool.

629
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:38,376
-Conquest should be ours my love.
-I love you.

630
00:51:44,418 --> 00:51:47,489
Come here.

631
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,625
Thank you.

632
00:51:50,658 --> 00:51:53,629
You hold that a lot.

633
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:56,901
Your wife's?

634
00:51:56,934 --> 00:52:00,005
I lost someone too you know.

635
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:02,909
He was my heart and soul.

636
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:09,115
Joe, I can't bring
her back. I know that.

637
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:12,322
But what I can do

638
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:16,562
is create a world where
that love can exist.

639
00:52:16,918 --> 00:52:19,045
I just want to go away with you.

640
00:52:20,862 --> 00:52:22,854
This isn't the city
I used to know.

641
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:25,140
People used to look up to us.

642
00:52:27,104 --> 00:52:29,208
The corporations
have taken over.

643
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:33,752
It's like the people don't even
matter anymore.

644
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:36,405
The system doesn't work.

645
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:40,397
This. This is all forgery.

646
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:42,691
It's a corruption
of the human condition.

647
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:46,029
I saw this coming

648
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,699
even before my wife took a
bullet to the chest.

649
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,043
Can you believe in us?

650
00:52:58,076 --> 00:53:01,113
Us?

651
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:04,084
I believe in you Joe.

652
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:52,219
I am not you!

653
00:54:52,253 --> 00:54:55,224
I will never

654
00:54:55,256 --> 00:54:58,227
be you!

655
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:01,399
I am Joe

656
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:04,535
Marshall!

657
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:07,605
No!

658
00:55:26,396 --> 00:55:29,400
The day has come my
friend. We have risen

659
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:32,637
and secured all
that's necessary.

660
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:35,674
We can only succeed and prevail
from here forth.

661
00:55:35,706 --> 00:55:38,845
Due to necessary nutrients.

662
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:41,781
It will be an honor
joining you on this journey.

663
00:55:41,815 --> 00:55:45,154
My senior.

664
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:48,222
You taught me everything I know.

665
00:55:48,255 --> 00:55:54,298
If you die,
I die with you.

666
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,402
You're always trying to escape.

667
00:55:57,435 --> 00:56:00,572
You are like a Houdini. I was

668
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:03,642
fucking partner man and you
left me high and dry.

669
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:06,646
I stuck it out far beyond
anything you can understand.

670
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,717
Why don't you just try to do
your job and join us?

671
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,888
The force? This job?

672
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:16,192
They took everything from you.

673
00:56:16,225 --> 00:56:19,196
It's you. You don't

674
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:22,365
exist.
That was you.

675
00:56:22,398 --> 00:56:25,670
Excuse me?
When I was a kid,

676
00:56:25,703 --> 00:56:28,573
I was on a camping trip and I swear I
saw you fighting some old Japanese dude

677
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:31,644
-in the woods, with a sword.
-No, that wasn't me.

678
00:56:31,677 --> 00:56:34,582
There's a lot of maniac cops
running around LA.

679
00:56:34,614 --> 00:56:37,851
Sorry to bother you.

680
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:40,957
Come on honey. Let's leave
these nice gentlemen alone.

681
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,825
By the way, your partner
is kind of hot.

682
00:56:53,304 --> 00:56:56,408
Frank, what are you doing here?

683
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,579
You seen the girl lately?

684
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:02,683
No, I've been trying
to call her all day.

685
00:57:02,716 --> 00:57:05,653
-Not sure I like your tone.
-You won't find her.

686
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:08,790
She skipped town man.

687
00:57:08,823 --> 00:57:11,893
-What are you talking about?
-Milena Roberts.

688
00:57:11,926 --> 00:57:15,865
It's not her real name.
She goes by several aliases.

689
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:20,448
It's Anya Tavolva,
Marlena McDonald.

690
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:22,810
She was fired by NYPD
ten years ago.

691
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:28,348
-She's playing you, man.
-Playing me? Playing me how?

692
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:32,354
I think she slipped you some
hallucinogens.

693
00:57:32,387 --> 00:57:36,493
She's manipulating you.

694
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:52,712
I got some intel from Higgins.

695
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:56,684
A new building. A new location.
It's called a complex.

696
00:57:56,717 --> 00:57:59,746
It's where all the
clans come together.

697
00:57:59,747 --> 00:58:03,147
They're responsible for all
these attacks and murders.

698
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,528
They're trying to trap you.

699
00:58:08,733 --> 00:58:12,737
Hold the weapon like it was
part of your body.

700
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:16,742
You know how to hold
the sword, don't you?

701
00:58:16,776 --> 00:58:20,781
-Yes, I do.
-Mr. Katano.

702
00:58:20,814 --> 00:58:24,720
I am undefeated.

703
00:58:28,857 --> 00:58:32,996
Mr. Cozo.

704
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:37,135
-What's the news on Ginza?
-We don't expect any

705
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:41,406
retaliation any time soon.
However, the word on the street

706
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,479
is that Joe Marshall is back in
town and the Katana

707
00:58:45,512 --> 00:58:48,642
believe that he
is the chosen one.

708
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:54,247
Hey, Washington. You and the
legend back together again.

709
00:58:54,248 --> 00:58:57,115
Legend? From what I hear,
most people just thought

710
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,053
-I was dead.
-You fucking guys!

711
00:59:00,054 --> 00:59:04,987
-Hey, Captain. Be nice. Nice?
-Nice, isn't in my vocabulary

712
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:08,606
-fighting the Kakuzu. You get it?
-Yes, sir.

713
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:13,358
Not another word. You're off
the case. Give me your badges.

714
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,428
You can't take my badge sir.
You can't! I worked all my life...

715
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,644
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To bring
down the Kakuzu in another 20 years.

716
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,975
Come on, Come on.

717
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:27,911
-Frank.
-No, don't say it.

718
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:30,412
And as for you, my
little provisional deputy.

719
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:34,342
You stay out of this mess because
it's my ass that's on the line.

720
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,079
Truth be told, the FBI is
taking over the damn case.

721
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:49,066
This is Director Cutter,
Federal Bureau Investigations.

722
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:55,608
Hello, my followers.

723
00:59:55,609 --> 01:00:00,333
The case is under our
jurisdiction now.

724
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:07,490
Our organization will handle the Yakuza
problem expeditiously and fiercely.

725
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:12,176
We need your participation,
Mr. Marshall.

726
01:00:17,975 --> 01:00:22,383
The forces in the world need to be
one of healthy spirit and energy.

727
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:24,990
You must join the regime.

728
01:00:26,272 --> 01:00:31,021
Vitamins and herbs. Very good
for you. I take fifty a day.

729
01:00:33,823 --> 01:00:35,113
Here. Drink it.

730
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:38,853
I said, drink it.

731
01:00:41,147 --> 01:00:42,993
No, thanks.

732
01:00:49,586 --> 01:00:51,169
Wuss.

733
01:00:55,206 --> 01:00:59,546
Joe. Hey, Joe.

734
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,318
-T's going on man? Joe. Joe. Joe.
-Listen to me.

735
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:07,323
-I gotta go.
-Hey, Joe. Come on.

736
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:09,624
Hey that was a pretty cool move.

737
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:13,597
Are you going to teach me that like
you told me you would 20 years ago?

738
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:21,873
Where you going Joe?

739
01:01:21,906 --> 01:01:25,811
The hell is wrong with that guy?

740
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:42,333
-How did I know you'd come by?
-Frank.

741
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:46,236
Yeah. Look whose peace you're
disturbing now.

742
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:50,644
Hey. I need your help.

743
01:01:50,676 --> 01:01:54,616
I've sworn off violence man.
I came here to find inner peace.

744
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:58,753
Remember that one?
Don't bother me.

745
01:01:58,787 --> 01:02:02,391
-I'm on suspension.
-Frank, I'm being serious.

746
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:51,153
Sorry, wrong number.

747
01:02:51,186 --> 01:02:55,324
My ninjas have

748
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:59,363
failed me. It will
be I that kills you.

749
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:27,864
Damn.

750
01:03:27,898 --> 01:03:30,818
Let's go get us some Katana.

751
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:34,277
-Ok, my man.
-Right on.

752
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:12,820
No!

753
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:20,496
I will handle that.
Give me the map.

754
01:04:20,497 --> 01:04:23,222
But the complex? Certain guys.
I know what's gonna happen.

755
01:04:23,223 --> 01:04:29,309
-Give me the map. No, our love.
-No, Niko, stay with me.

756
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:33,380
-I love you. Stay with me.
-Where is the map. I love you.

757
01:04:33,413 --> 01:04:37,518
-Give me the map. I need the map.
-Stay with me.

758
01:04:37,552 --> 01:04:41,290
-The map. Come on. You can do it.
-I love you.

759
01:04:41,323 --> 01:04:45,361
I love you too.

760
01:04:45,394 --> 01:04:49,401
Hey.

761
01:04:54,738 --> 01:04:57,845
Please, don't go. Niko!

762
01:05:11,532 --> 01:05:13,049
Marshall. Washington.

763
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:17,036
Listen, I think you two better
start watching your backs.

764
01:05:17,037 --> 01:05:19,646
Captain Harmon. Well, he's
clean. I know this,

765
01:05:19,647 --> 01:05:22,016
but there are some
higher ups that even

766
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:25,218
he has to answer to and I don't
think it's going to be very long.

767
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:28,361
-We'll be on the lookout.
-And Washington,

768
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:30,952
Jesus Christ, straighten
out your arms.

769
01:05:30,953 --> 01:05:33,009
A 45 has a hell of a dig.

770
01:05:50,677 --> 01:05:54,484
Hello, Joe.
Back again I see.

771
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:55,626
Good to see you, Lucky.

772
01:05:55,627 --> 01:05:58,701
It's nice to see an old friend
after all these years.

773
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:00,428
How you been?

774
01:06:01,103 --> 01:06:04,321
Well, I'm not so sure
about your lady friend.

775
01:06:04,322 --> 01:06:07,018
You know, she claimed to be the PD.

776
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:11,008
I'm not sure about that because
she's been consorting

777
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:15,873
with the Katana executives. Now the
Feds have had an eye on this place.

778
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:18,434
They call it the complex.

779
01:06:18,435 --> 01:06:22,854
But it's on embassy grounds and
they claim diplomatic immunity.

780
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:26,613
However, we do have a mole on the
inside and that's the key for you.

781
01:06:26,614 --> 01:06:30,333
Now, if you get inside,
you contact him.

782
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:35,353
They call him Mola Ram.
You contact him and he'll help you.

783
01:06:35,354 --> 01:06:38,815
The problem with the complex is
people walk in but a lot people

784
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:42,959
don't walk out. So, be careful.

785
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,876
See you soon.

786
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:50,706
Hey, Marshall.

787
01:06:51,585 --> 01:06:55,623
Lucky isn't telling you telling
you the whole story.

788
01:06:55,656 --> 01:06:59,563
If you go to the complex alone,
you might not make it back.

789
01:06:59,596 --> 01:07:03,501
-I know.
-You sure you have to do this?

790
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:07,572
-I do.
-I have the map

791
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:11,710
that will lead you there.

792
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:16,050
This is the key
that will get you in.

793
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:20,155
-You feel you really need to go.
-Yeah.

794
01:07:20,189 --> 01:07:23,601
You know, 25 years ago I lost
my arm, but I was given

795
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:28,406
a new life. I just
want to help out here.

796
01:07:28,407 --> 01:07:32,271
I'd give you a hand,
but... Be well.

797
01:07:42,302 --> 01:07:44,553
Namu myoho renge kyo.

798
01:07:44,586 --> 01:07:48,558
Namu myoho renge kyo.

799
01:07:52,662 --> 01:07:56,634
-Okamura.
-Joe Marshall.

800
01:07:56,667 --> 01:08:00,739
Samurai cop, it is I...

801
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:04,778
The evil in your brain.

802
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:09,084
It is I that keeps you awake.

803
01:08:09,116 --> 01:08:13,121
I will share the secret of the
clan, but in return

804
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:17,260
I need your help
to kill every one

805
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:21,298
of my enemies. Do you hear me
samurai cop?

806
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:25,337
-I do.
-I need for you

807
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:28,143
to infiltrate the complex.

808
01:08:28,144 --> 01:08:32,613
-Are you familiar with the complex?
-Yes.

809
01:08:32,614 --> 01:08:37,418
When do you think you can
start on this journey?

810
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:41,591
As soon as possible,
Okamura son.

811
01:08:41,623 --> 01:08:45,529
Tell me, Marshall. Do
you have what it takes

812
01:08:45,562 --> 01:08:49,667
to rise to this challenge?

813
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,639
Samurai cop, don't fail me!

814
01:08:57,776 --> 01:09:01,781
My warrior.

815
01:13:49,643 --> 01:13:52,279
You should have gone to
japanese school.

816
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,050
It's over there.

817
01:14:32,194 --> 01:14:35,165
Damn.

818
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,571
Damn Joe.

819
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:41,308
What did you do man?

820
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:47,747
Time is over for
you, Mr. Marshall.

821
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:50,785
You should have stopped
when you had the chance.

822
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,790
I'm gonna prosecute you
with your own system.

823
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,727
I am judge, jury and
executioner.

824
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:02,834
Vengeance is mine.
Ginzas are a one man jury.

825
01:15:02,867 --> 01:15:09,075
-We are quality over your imperialism.
-And now Marshall,

826
01:15:09,109 --> 01:15:12,111
the choice is yours.

827
01:15:12,145 --> 01:15:15,083
Pull the string.

828
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:24,661
What is this?

829
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:27,797
I had miles to go.

830
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:30,968
There is no room for you.

831
01:15:31,002 --> 01:15:33,940
Joe, go on your way.
God speed to you.

832
01:15:33,973 --> 01:15:36,977
Remember Mola Ram!

833
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:40,114
Father! Father!

834
01:15:40,147 --> 01:15:43,217
Father, I shall go
to the depths of hell

835
01:15:43,251 --> 01:15:46,187
to avenge you. I shall
bring vengeance

836
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:49,291
and soul determination

837
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:52,196
to the kingdom. I shall
bring salvation.

838
01:16:13,988 --> 01:16:20,065
You passed to the next level
samurai, but it ends here.

839
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:23,033
We finally got you and you
cannot escape.

840
01:16:23,066 --> 01:16:26,271
Take him to the freezer!

841
01:16:26,304 --> 01:16:29,341
You should have never come out
of your dead existence, Marshall.

842
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:32,146
You've done. You've uprooted us.

843
01:16:35,248 --> 01:16:38,220
We are ghosts Marshall.

844
01:16:38,252 --> 01:16:41,323
Not even a mirage.

845
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:44,227
Thought we broke up at the bar.

846
01:17:11,796 --> 01:17:14,798
Dating game.

847
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:17,936
Over.

848
01:18:19,113 --> 01:18:22,116
And now Joe,

849
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:25,087
I have you all to myself.

850
01:18:28,324 --> 01:18:31,295
Do you want to play samurai?

851
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:52,520
Sweet.

852
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:55,592
It's over my darling, Dogge.

853
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,963
Now it's your chance
to make it right.

854
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:01,966
Do the right thing. We make
such a cute couple, don't we?

855
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:05,780
My italian lover.
I have watched you from afar.

856
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:09,115
My heart longs
for your touch.

857
01:19:26,263 --> 01:19:32,263
In this lifetime on earth, Joe,
we are meant to be together.

858
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:41,214
-Not in this lifetime.
-Yes.

859
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:44,452
In this lifetime, Joe.

860
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:50,660
Shit. You made me bleed.
You're gonna pay for it.

861
01:19:50,694 --> 01:19:53,998
Joe! You are mine.
We could have made such

862
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:57,101
an ultimate couple.
Just think of our

863
01:19:57,134 --> 01:20:00,106
offspring together.
Only if you knew the pleasure

864
01:20:00,138 --> 01:20:03,109
of being inside of me.

865
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:15,224
Joe.

866
01:20:15,258 --> 01:20:18,262
Say goodbye!

867
01:20:30,576 --> 01:20:36,751
What I've done
has been glorious.

868
01:20:36,785 --> 01:20:39,756
Death is only a woman too.
Think of us.

869
01:20:39,788 --> 01:20:42,792
It's not the final ending.

870
01:20:42,825 --> 01:20:46,097
I'll be

871
01:20:46,129 --> 01:20:49,100
I'll be back.

872
01:21:10,626 --> 01:21:12,284
Why are you using
that medieval thing?

873
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:15,050
Because it brings
me good luck, Frank.

874
01:21:15,051 --> 01:21:19,258
Shogun Takata gave this to me.

875
01:21:30,715 --> 01:21:31,854
You're kidding me.

876
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:47,439
Let's go.

877
01:21:53,547 --> 01:21:56,584
Hi Joe.

878
01:21:56,618 --> 01:22:00,685
I was waiting entire my life for this.

879
01:22:00,686 --> 01:22:02,866
You think you're
chosen one, Joe?

880
01:22:02,867 --> 01:22:04,809
I never claimed to be.

881
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:08,846
You got that wrong, Joe,
and now

882
01:22:08,847 --> 01:22:14,840
there is no more room
for words, Joe.

883
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:27,357
We have to do this.

884
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:30,293
This is something we must do!

885
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:36,433
There is no room for the words,
Joe.

886
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:39,438
No room at all!

887
01:22:42,509 --> 01:22:45,613
I kill you Joe!

888
01:22:45,645 --> 01:22:48,616
This is my destiny, Joe!

889
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:51,687
This is my birth rights!

890
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:54,857
Why you are

891
01:22:54,891 --> 01:22:57,862
cheating my destiny,
Joe. Ever since

892
01:22:57,894 --> 01:23:00,830
I burned. I earned, not burned.

893
01:23:00,863 --> 01:23:03,835
Not born. Joe!

894
01:23:03,867 --> 01:23:06,558
No one can stop me but I

895
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:11,418
can stop myself, but I will
not stop myself, Joe.

896
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:19,287
I own the palace. I own
25 of them and I built more.

897
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:25,395
I eat them for breakfast, Joe.
You got that?

898
01:23:25,428 --> 01:23:31,469
I listen to humanity, Joe,
and I buried it in my sleep!

899
01:23:31,503 --> 01:23:34,441
Ever since I was born, Joe.

900
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:37,477
When I reversed

901
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,513
little boys.

902
01:23:59,003 --> 01:24:02,008
You gotta be a better.

903
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:04,946
I'm gonna kill you.

904
01:24:04,978 --> 01:24:08,282
I will piss on your

905
01:24:08,316 --> 01:24:11,353
eyes. I will throw
a curse on you.

906
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:14,323
Your mother will
not recognize you!

907
01:24:14,357 --> 01:24:20,632
Chen Chow was my
best friend and he became

908
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:23,601
a woman because of alcohol.

909
01:24:23,634 --> 01:24:26,638
Surprise stranger.

910
01:24:51,369 --> 01:24:54,474
There is

911
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:57,411
something I have to tell you,
Samurai.

912
01:24:57,444 --> 01:25:00,415
I'm listening.

913
01:25:00,447 --> 01:25:06,555
My initiation to the Shinjuku.
I had to kill a girl.

914
01:25:06,589 --> 01:25:09,626
A beautiful girl.

915
01:25:09,658 --> 01:25:12,696
It was so easy.
She was so beautiful.

916
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:15,767
Most beautiful I ever saw.

917
01:25:15,799 --> 01:25:21,841
I still see her in
my dreams, Joe.

918
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:27,916
Beautiful, long hair,
stained in red blood.

919
01:25:27,949 --> 01:25:30,986
Red blood, Joe.

920
01:25:31,019 --> 01:25:34,057
Red! She haunts me.

921
01:25:34,089 --> 01:25:37,026
Wherever I go.

922
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:52,647
I see miracles. Elements.

923
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:58,042
You ever witness or see
the act of love and hate,

924
01:25:58,043 --> 01:26:04,476
which both inspire me and
repel me, but I believe that love

925
01:26:04,477 --> 01:26:07,933
is one continuous stream
which is never ends

926
01:26:07,965 --> 01:26:12,424
It is through love to
experience ultimate love.

927
01:26:12,425 --> 01:26:16,023
That what drives us
all, isn't it, Joe?

928
01:26:26,055 --> 01:26:32,095
Don't kill him,
Joe.

929
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,503
How long have you been
in the Katana's pocket?

930
01:26:38,537 --> 01:26:41,641
How did you know?

931
01:26:41,673 --> 01:26:44,712
You didn't think I'd find
traces of the drug in my body

932
01:26:44,745 --> 01:26:47,783
after I realized
what was going on?

933
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:50,652
Sorry, Joe.
Linton's my brother.

934
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:56,961
It's true.

935
01:26:56,993 --> 01:27:00,064
You played with my emotions.

936
01:27:00,097 --> 01:27:03,268
Joe, I'm sorry.

937
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:06,239
We had to. To take down Dogge
and the Katana,

938
01:27:06,272 --> 01:27:08,536
we infiltrated them.

939
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:11,311
We ate like them.
We lived like them.

940
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:18,721
They didn't think you were
special and I believed in you.

941
01:27:18,753 --> 01:27:21,724
You were special.
You're special.

942
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:27,933
You are specialist,
Milena.

943
01:27:27,965 --> 01:27:31,002
You brought peace
to the Shinjukus,

944
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:34,073
Joe. We're good people.

945
01:27:34,105 --> 01:27:37,110
Don't think of
this as a betrayal.

946
01:27:37,143 --> 01:27:43,985
You sacrified your emotions
for an entire people.

947
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:53,196
And now, god speed
to you and your life.

948
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:56,235
Bye, Joe.

949
01:27:59,272 --> 01:28:05,612
So, do I need to
send in more cavalry?

950
01:28:05,645 --> 01:28:08,617
It's cool, Gail.
Just another day.

951
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,654
Just another day.

952
01:29:49,274 --> 01:29:52,279
Fresh air. Isn't it beautiful?

953
01:29:52,313 --> 01:29:55,316
-The best part of freedom.
-You got it.

954
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:58,254
Joe, pick up the pace man.

955
01:30:01,389 --> 01:30:04,394
What's the matter, Marshall?

956
01:30:04,428 --> 01:30:10,470
It's all over now.
It's time to move on.

957
01:30:10,502 --> 01:30:13,472
It's only just getting started.

958
01:30:18,866 --> 01:30:19,814
Hey!

959
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:22,852
Mr. Marshall. My god.

960
01:30:22,884 --> 01:30:26,021
How fortunate am
I to see you again

961
01:30:26,055 --> 01:30:28,959
and for you to be my first
customer? How are you doing?

962
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:32,129
-Mr. Sebastian.
-Yes.

963
01:30:32,163 --> 01:30:35,067
Just exactly how many part time
transportation jobs do you have?

964
01:30:35,099 --> 01:30:37,937
-A lot.
-Will you please take them home?

965
01:30:42,557 --> 01:30:44,109
I won't be joining them.

966
01:30:45,048 --> 01:30:46,950
What? So you mean,

967
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:49,767
the old undercover
cop has to go it alone?

968
01:30:50,285 --> 01:30:53,455
I'm not going with you.

969
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:56,226
So what are you going to do?
You gonna ride off into the sunset?

970
01:30:58,629 --> 01:31:02,875
I'll go where I'm needed.
I don't have a home anymore.

971
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:05,377
We did it, partner.

972
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:07,411
We took them all down.

973
01:31:08,384 --> 01:31:12,477
Take care my brother.
Don't be a stranger.

974
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:39,360
I don't want to fight anymore.
I'm tired of being a bad girl. 

975
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:42,017
Maybe we can join forces.

976
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:48,346
I know.

977
01:31:48,347 --> 01:31:51,104
Keep it warm.

978
01:31:51,139 --> 01:31:53,028
Bingo.

979
01:33:24,288 --> 01:33:26,889
It's not over.
