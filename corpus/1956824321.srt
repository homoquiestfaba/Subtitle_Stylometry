00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:08,364
Sir, that is all I said, sir!

353
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:12,268
Let's move! We have a briefing
in the C.O.'s office.

354
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,216
Mr. Lassen.

355
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,917
We have a package that
needs to be delivered

356
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:30,719
to Kirkland Air Base
in the United States

357
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,288
within the next 12 hours.

358
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:34,223
It's absolutely essential
there be no further

359
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,226
personal communication
outside of the desert.

360
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,994
There's a better than
average chance

361
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,230
we'll be subjected to
further reconnaissance.

362
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:42,531
Sir?

363
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:44,066
Second Lieutenant Alex Marcus.

364
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,335
I'd like to volunteer our
squad for air defense.

365
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:48,203
Kid, you have no idea
what's coming for us.

366
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,871
No, sir, I guess I don't.

367
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,141
Most likely, Russian military.

368
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:55,244
A trio of green,
untested Air Force cadets

369
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:57,079
lacking surface to air support

370
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,415
is hardly a match
for Russian U47s.

371
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,017
Yes, your only option is
to run this mission, sir.

372
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,955
You may get that chance,
Lieutenant.

373
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,625
Second Lieutenant Spielman, sir.

374
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:11,894
Second Lieutenant Brown, sir.

375
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,196
If the Russian military
attacks this base,

376
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:16,231
is that not considered
an act of war?

377
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:18,467
Unfortunately, in the court
of international law,

378
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:21,103
our actions to date would be
considered terrorism.

379
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,773
- Great.
- Joy.

380
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,143
And Colonel Herring could be
regarded as harboring fugitives.

381
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:32,114
Here's how I would
like to proceed

382
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,482
with your permission, sir.

383
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,451
Let's hear it.

384
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,686
I don't mind the idea
of having three pilots

385
00:24:37,753 --> 00:24:39,955
available for the FA-18 Hornets.

386
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,191
If you have anybody
available to repair

387
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:45,294
our aircraft, I would
appreciate that.

388
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:48,497
Master Sergeant Kelley,
Mr. Oliver, Mr. Rapp and myself

389
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:51,734
will give a refresher
on basic infantry skills.

390
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,002
Master Sergeant, can we
get some weapons, please?

391
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:55,170
We can, sir.

392
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:56,672
Need I remind you, Mr. Lassen,

393
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:58,841
these kids are fresh
out of Air Force Academy.

394
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:00,509
They've never put
a bullet in anyone.

395
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:02,411
Everybody's gotta
start somewhere.

396
00:25:08,984 --> 00:25:09,952
Good stance, Lieutenant.

397
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:11,387
Thank you, sir.

398
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:15,791
Elbows tucked in and down!

399
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,393
Hold that rifle
like you mean it!

400
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:19,361
Got it.
Thank you, ma'am.

401
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,530
Keep it up, keep it up.
Right there. Right there.

402
00:25:21,597 --> 00:25:23,532
Pull it tight.

403
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,968
Elbows tucked in and down.

404
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:27,636
Hold that rifle
like you mean it!

405
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:29,138
Widen your stance.

406
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:30,372
Your feet should be
under your shoulders.

407
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:31,473
Yes, sir!

408
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:34,109
Ah!

409
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:35,444
How does it feel to have
a loaded rifle

410
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,479
in your face even
though it is jammed?

411
00:25:37,546 --> 00:25:39,915
- Sorry.
- You made your point.

412
00:25:42,184 --> 00:25:44,186
If you all can't think
clearly right now

413
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,754
when you're not being shot at,

414
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:48,892
how are you gonna perform
when you are being shot at?

415
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:50,759
I understand you're pilots.

416
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:54,163
The saying that goes for up
here goes for down here.

417
00:25:54,229 --> 00:25:57,332
Keep your head
in the game at all times.

418
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:03,505
Still got a little time left.

419
00:26:03,572 --> 00:26:05,941
Mr. Oliver, assist
them for another 30.

420
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:09,144
I'm gonna get a SITREP and
find out where our EXFIL is.

421
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:11,613
All right,
let's keep going, guys.

423
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,556
Who's the best pilot
out of that group?

424
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:23,258
Marcus.

425
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:25,394
He's cocky, but talented.

426
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,663
I'm not opposed to Marcus's
idea of providing

427
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:31,600
some sort of diversion as an
attack using the FA-18 Hornets.

428
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:33,268
Well, Lieutenant Barret,

429
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,170
who I know isn't on the top
of your list presently,

430
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:37,739
is a fine mechanic as well.

431
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,108
Okay, put Barret
on our aircraft.

432
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:42,177
Hey, earlier in that briefing,

433
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:44,813
you said there was a chance
of an assault on our base.

434
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:46,748
Yes?

435
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:47,749
How likely is that?

436
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:21,717
Jamie, you all right?

437
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:27,723
There's something
I need to tell you.

438
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:38,300
I put in for reassignment.

439
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:44,473
Reassignment?

440
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,309
To who, where?

441
00:27:50,512 --> 00:27:54,816
Just here, but just as support.

442
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:59,087
I'm not cut out to fly.

443
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:00,556

444
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:01,723
You.

00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:04,793
Alex, Kathryn.

446
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:10,799
You know, in handling
that gun today

447
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:14,336
it just made me realize that,
if it came to it,

448
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,439
I couldn't shoot
an enemy plane down.

449
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:19,474
Well, at least you don't have
to shoot your enemy in the face.

450
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,579
That's supposed
to make me feel better?

451
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:26,815
I didn't mean it like that.

00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,022
God, that was such a stupid
thing to say.

455
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,424
It's fine.
It's fine.

456
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,093
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,861
It's fine.

458
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:42,798
Colonel Herring and Lassen want
me to try and fix that Valkyrie.

459
00:28:44,366 --> 00:28:47,235
So I'm gonna give that
a try, at least.

460
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:51,206
Good.

461
00:28:52,909 --> 00:28:53,842
Good, I'm glad.

462
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:56,612
Fix that futuristic
jet of theirs

463
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:57,880
and get 'em to hell
outta here, right?

You saw how that one put
his gun in Barret's face?

00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:19,434
Who do these people
think they are?

468

they are or were.

at our cruising altitude

531
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,031

let's drop it down to 5,000,

I'm gonna take to 3,000 and see
if I an shake 'em up a bit.

01:11:18,786 --> 01:11:20,489
Pull up, man. Pull up!

1060
01:11:20,556 --> 01:11:22,191
Damn it, Spielman, we only
wanted to take his rudder out,

1061
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:23,359
not make him crash!

1062
01:11:23,425 --> 01:11:25,127
No! I know!

1063
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:30,166
Pull up!

1064
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:32,001
Pull up! Pull up!

1065
01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:35,104
Damn it!

1066
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,440
I'm sorry, Alex.

1067
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:41,911
Wait, wait!

1068
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:43,212
No, no, no, look!
He's running!

1069
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:49,684
- There he is.
- How'd he survive that?

1070
01:11:49,751 --> 01:11:53,088
Alex, take her down.

1071
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:54,890
I'm goin' after the CRISPR.

1072
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:56,691
Are you sure about this?

1073
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:00,262
Time to Cowboy up, right?

1074
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:04,600
Copy that.

1075
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:07,570
Let's get ready
to take her down.

1076
01:12:07,636 --> 01:12:09,338
Let's take her down.

1077
01:12:10,606 --> 01:12:11,806
Hold tight!

1078
01:12:11,873 --> 01:12:13,142
All right, guys.

1079
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:15,444
It's gonna be a
bumpy one, okay?

1080
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:17,479
- All right.
- Hang on!

1081
01:12:22,685 --> 01:12:25,654
Nice and slow, hold on.

1082
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,256
Nice and slow.

1083
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:29,058
All right.
It's gonna be a rough landing.

1084
01:12:29,124 --> 01:12:32,827
Touchdown in three, two, one.

1085
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:40,569
We'll have the Valkyrie
ready to go.

1086
01:12:40,636 --> 01:12:42,770
Based on the way
he's moving on the monitor,

1087
01:12:42,837 --> 01:12:43,973
he looks pretty banged up.

1088
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:45,773
This one's yours, Spielman.

1089
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,110
But if you're not back in 10,
we're coming after you.

1090
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:54,903
Oh! Oh!

what is your status?</i>

1094
01:16:29,899 --> 01:16:31,867
- Do you copy?
- <i>We do copy.</i>

1095
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:33,502
We have the CRISPR, one injured.

<i>Copy. We understand
you have the CRISPR.</i>

<i>Please proceed to

<i>Copy.

1099
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,772
Looks good.

1100
01:17:49,012 --> 01:17:49,946
Well done.

1101
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,280
Everything looks intact.

1102
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,921
Thanks, guys. We'll get you
briefed and back to Asan.

1103
01:17:57,987 --> 01:17:59,821
Who says I'm going back to Asan?

1104
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:05,661
How are we gonna protect
America without you?

1105
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:08,463
Could we we technically say
that we saved the whole world?

1106
01:18:12,267 --> 01:18:14,770
You've done your country
a great service.

1107
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,338
Saved a lot of lives.

1108
01:18:20,877 --> 01:18:22,277
And lost a lot of them, too.

1109
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:26,181
We have them to thank.

1110
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:31,386
I've trained a lot
of pilots in my career,

1111
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:33,488
some good, some real good.

1112
01:18:33,555 --> 01:18:36,792
And then a few that
are truly exceptional.

1113
01:18:36,858 --> 01:18:39,561
To be an exceptional pilot,
much like being

1114
01:18:39,628 --> 01:18:42,798
in Special Forces, sometimes you
need to think outside the box.

1115
01:18:42,864 --> 01:18:46,168
You need to be a rebel,
but not a mutineer.

1116
01:18:46,234 --> 01:18:48,704
Sometimes the answer lies
right in front of you.

1117
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,607
Other times, you need
to search deep for it.

1118
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:55,677
In combat, it is easy
to lose your cool.

1119
01:18:55,744 --> 01:18:58,246
But those who can keep
a cool head and stay calm

1120
01:18:58,313 --> 01:19:00,917
are the ones who've
proved to be leaders,

1121
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:06,089
leaders that we so desperately
need in these desperate times,

1122
01:19:06,154 --> 01:19:08,857
those capable of
heroic acts of courage

1123
01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:10,626
not only to protect
one's country,

1124
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,694
but be willing
to lay down their life

1125
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:15,364
for that of their
fellow servicemen.

1126
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,467
Most pilots like Marcus,
Brown and Spielman will never be

1127
01:19:18,533 --> 01:19:20,435
called upon and
do what those great pilots

1128
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:24,573
have done: to actually
engage in ground warfare.

1129
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,242
It's another thing
entirely to look your enemy

1130
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:30,579
in the eye to see the
life drain from them.

1131
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:33,749
That's one advantage
to being a pilot.

1132
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:36,284
But even still,
the knowledge of your actions

1133
01:19:36,351 --> 01:19:38,553
can still lay heavy
on your conscience,

1134
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,555
if you don't keep
the mission and the reason

1135
01:19:40,622 --> 01:19:42,591
at the forefront
of your thoughts.

1136
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:45,327
Lieutenants Marcus, Brown
and Spielman will have long,

1137
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:48,764
successful careers ahead of them
for as long as they wish.

1138
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,233
It's a chance to forge
pilots like these

1139
01:19:51,299 --> 01:19:54,403
that drives me to continue on.

1140
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:56,571
Their actions enabled Lassen
and his team

1141
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:58,807
to get the CRISPR to where
it needed to go.

1142
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:02,644
It's been reported that the
operation proved successful.

1143
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:05,647
Even at my rank, you don't
always get the full story.

1144
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:07,950
Sometimes you just get
"mission accomplished"

1145
01:20:08,017 --> 01:20:09,919
and that's all you can ask for.

1146
01:20:09,986 --> 01:20:12,854
I often wonder what
would have happened

1147
01:20:12,922 --> 01:20:16,725
had Lassen and his men landed
in another training base.

1148
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:20,629
But, luckily,
they landed in mine.
