310
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,765
YOU CAN SELL THEM ANYTHING.

311
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,334
HOW DO YOU THINK                
I PASSED U.S. HISTORY?

312
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,936
ONE DAY, WE WERE TAKING         
THIS TEST AND...

313
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,104
[TAPPING]

314
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,272
DAD?

315
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:32,941
REMEMBER THE GUY    
            YOU SAID WOULD COME

316
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,110
IF WE DIDN'T        
            EAT OUR VEGETABLES?

317
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:36,111
HE'S HERE.

318
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,113
THAT'S NOT                      
THE BOOGEYMAN.

319
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:39,881
IT'S A HOMICIDAL KILLER.

320
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:46,455
ZATCH.

321
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,926
AAH!

322
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,728
AAH!

323
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,564
AAH!

324
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,066
AAH!

325
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,403
HYAH!

326
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:19,855
AAH!

327
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,089
HYAH!

328
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,197
AAH!                        
                        AAH!

329
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:34,603
AH-HYAH!

330
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:43,879
YOU'RE GETTING OLD, MAC.

331
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,786
AAH!

332
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:51,854
AAH!

333
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:53,021
HYAH!

334
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,059
HYAH, SKATEBOARDER!

335
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,264
HYAH!

336
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:24,519
ME NO SPEAK ENGLISH.

337
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,021
I WASH DISHES.

338
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,456
I--OH, FINE.

339
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:28,490
I--AAH!

340
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,894
ZATCH, GET THE KIDS             
OUT OF HERE!

341
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:34,897
NO! WE'RE NOT LEAVING           
OUR DAD!

342
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:36,132
YOU'VE GOT  
                    TO GO NOW!

343
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,199
COME ON.

344
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,301
NO. NO! DAD!

345
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,238
NORMALLY, I'D STAY AND FIGHT,   
BUT IT IS A SCHOOL NIGHT.

346
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:44,073
JOHNNY, WAIT UP!

347
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:49,278
COME ON.

348
00:16:51,348 --> 00:16:52,782
LISTEN. WHO ARE YOU?

349
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,083
JUMP!                       
    LET'S GO!

350
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,517
OH! AAH!

351
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:58,854
KWANTZU!

352
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,090
AAH!

353
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,725
HEY, LOOK,                      
I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS.

354
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,727
I'M JUST GOING TO EXPLAIN       
TO THESE NINJA GUYS

355
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:07,729
THAT I DON'T                    
HAVE ANY--MMM!

356
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,298
LISTEN. WHAT
                    IS GOING ON?

357
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,233
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS  
        FOR ONE MINUTE?

358
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:12,301
JUST ONE MINUTE.        
        I GOT ONE THING TO SAY,

359
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,302
AND THEN                
        I'LL BE QUIET.

360
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,237
HEY!

361
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:17,239
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

362
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,308
I FELT REALLY SAFE          
    IN YOUR ARMS,

363
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,944
AND I'VE NEVER SAID         
    THAT TO A MAN BEFORE.

364
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,179
LISTEN,                         
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

365
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:24,746
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE             
OUR DAD ALL ALONE

366
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:25,747
WITH THOSE GUYS.

367
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:26,682
QUIET!

368
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,618
YOUR HIGHNESSES.

369
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:32,754
YOU MUST BE QUIET.

370
00:17:32,824 --> 00:17:34,256
LOOK, WHO WERE                  
THOSE QUIMBIES

371
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:35,757
IN THE CAMOUFLAGE               
PAJAMAS?

372
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,326
BOY, THOSE UNIFORMS

373
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:38,760
REALLY GIVE THEM        
        A CHAMELEON-LIKE ABILITY

374
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,930
TO BLEND IN WITH        
        THEIR SURROUNDINGS.

375
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:42,431
WOULD YOU GUYS      
            JUST SHUT UP

376
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,599
AND LET THIS GUY--

377
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,101
WHERE'D HE GO?

378
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,704
I DON'T KNOW,           
    BUT I MISS HIM ALREADY.

379
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:02,718
Zatch:                  
    THEY HAVE TAKEN HIM.

380
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,820
WHOA! HOW DOES  
                HE DO THAT?

381
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:05,821
LIKE THIS.

382
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,389
"THEY HAVE TAKEN HIM."

383
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,358
WHO TOOK HIM?

384
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,994
THE SAME ONES WHO WANT YOU  
    DEAD, YOUR HIGHNESSES.

385
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:13,996
WHY DO YOU KEEP 
                CALLING US THAT?

386
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,998
BECAUSE YOU ARE     
            CROWN PRINCES,

387
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,933
AND YOUR FATHER     
            WAS A KING.

388
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,737
OH, UNREAL.

389
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:23,739
REMEMBER WHEN                   
I SAID BEFORE...

390
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:25,841
"WHAT IF MY FATHER  
            WAS A KING"?

391
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,943
THIS IS             
            COMPLETELY INSANE.

392
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:29,378
I'M A CROWN PRINCE.

393
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:30,612
NOT YOU.

394
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:32,748
<i> THEY</i> ARE           
             CROWN PRINCES,

395
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:35,251
AND THEIR FATHER    
            WAS A KING.

396
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,253
AND YOU ARE A MANIAC,

397
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:39,755
AND YOUR FATHER         
        WAS A MANIAC...

398
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,757
AND HIS FATHER                  
WAS A MANIAC,

399
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:43,759
AND<i> HIS</i> FATHER                 
 WAS A MANIAC.

400
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,761
ADAM, DON'T HELP ME.

401
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,196
YOU GET THE POINT.

402
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:51,267
AND THE GUY HIS FATHER          
BOUGHT HIS HOUSE FROM

403
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:52,368
WAS A MANIAC.                   
                        ADAM.

404
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:56,972
GOOD THINKING,          
        O PATCHED ONE.

405
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,207
LET THEM THINK THEY'RE  
        THE REAL CROWN PRINCES.

406
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,209
WE'LL USE THEM          
        FOR DECOYS.

407
00:19:00,278 --> 00:19:03,212
HEY, I'M GOING          
        TO GO CALL THE COPS.

408
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:04,713
LISTEN, THIS COULD      
        BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS,

409
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:07,649
SO I WANT YOU TO KEEP   
        ONE EYE ON MY FRIENDS

410
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:09,218
AND ONE--

411
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:12,154
WELL, YOU JUST DO       
        THE BEST YOU CAN.

412
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,891
Zatch: LISTEN TO ME.

413
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,127
SEARCH YOUR MEMORIES,           
YOUR HIGHNESSES.

414
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:19,295
WHAT DO YOU                     
REMEMBER OF LIFE

415
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:20,729
BEFORE YOU CAME                 
TO AMERICA?

416
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,432
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "BEFORE"?  
    WE WERE BORN HERE.

417
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:25,667
WEREN'T WE?

418
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:28,570
YOUR BROTHER WAS                
TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER.

419
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,707
BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER       
    SOMETHING OF PATUSAN.

420
00:19:32,776 --> 00:19:33,909
PORTA-SAN?

421
00:19:33,978 --> 00:19:36,912
UH, YOU MEAN THOSE TOILETS      
AT CONSTRUCTION SITES?

422
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:38,847
EW, I'D GIVE                    
UP THE THRONE.

423
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,083
NO, NOT PORTA-SAN.

424
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,486
PATUSAN.

425
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,762
FOR 4,000 YEARS,

426
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:55,264
PATUSAN...

427
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,267
RULED BY ONE LINE       
        OF WARRIOR KINGS,

428
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:01,203
WAS THE MOST PEACEFUL       
        PLACE ON EARTH.

429
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,914
THEN ONE DAY,           
    THE PEOPLE GATHERED

430
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:16,218
TO CELEBRATE THE BIRTH      
    OF CROWN PRINCE AD-HAM...

431
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:19,621
OF WHOM                 
    THE PROPHECIES FORETOLD

432
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,125
WOULD BECOME                
    A TRUE VISIONARY.

433
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:25,461
AND HIS BROTHER,            
    CROWN PRINCE YOW-NI,

434
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,297
WOULD BE EVEN           
    A GREATER WARRIOR KING

435
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:29,564
THAN HIS FATHER.

436
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:34,803
IT WAS FORETOLD         
    IN THE SEVENTH CYCLE,

437
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:36,638
AFTER MEN FLEW          
    AS EAGLES TO THE MOON--

438
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:38,640
Adam: WHOA, BABE.               
YOU JUST LOST ME.

439
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,076
THE PEACE WOULD BE          
    BROKEN BY BLOODSHED.

440
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:51,153
AAH!

441
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:52,821
AAH!                        
                    AAH!

442
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,990
[GUNSHOTS]

443
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,260
A VIOLENT COUP              
    LED BY COLONEL CHI,

444
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,262
A FOREIGN MERCENARY,

445
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:02,097
DEVASTATED OUR COUNTRY.

446
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:06,402
I WAS HEAD OF           
    THE IMPERIAL GUARD.

447
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,905
IT WAS MY DUTY          
    TO PROTECT THE ROYAL FAMILY

448
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:12,241
AT ANY COST.

449
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,276
HYAH! HYAH!

450
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,610
HYAH!

451
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:18,780
CHARGE!

452
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,949
HYAH!

453
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:22,784
HYAH!

454
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:23,818
HYAH!

455
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:25,787
HYAH!

456
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:26,788
AAH!

457
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:27,756
UHH!

458
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:31,560
ROTTEN HAT.

459
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:39,301
I WAS SUMMONED          
        TO THE PALACE

460
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,304
AND THERE ENTRUSTED TO      
    PROTECT THE ROYAL PRINCES,

461
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:43,805
YOW-NI AND AD-HAM,
