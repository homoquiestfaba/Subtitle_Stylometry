1
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:58,149
Your hands are… disgusting.

2
00:02:58,335 --> 00:02:59,584
Let me do it.

3
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:01,323
Disgusting?

4
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,090
Just breathe.

5
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,769
It's alright.

6
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,840
I'll go with Dad.

7
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:01,486
My truck's up there.

8
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:21,838
Don't worry.

9
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,542
Wait here.

10
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:54,433
What's wrong?

11
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,164
It's Dad!

12
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,744
Wait here.

13
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,807
I'm going back in…

14
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,487
Stay here.

15
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:48,861
No. Dad would've heard this.

16
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:54,938
You're lying!

17
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:57,287
My Dad used the radio every day!

18
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,835
You're nothing like him!

19
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,763
It's not a song.

20
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:55,598
On the radio.

21
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:58,130
Beyond The Sea… Right?

22
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,268
It's not a song…

23
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,321
It's a signal.

24
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,045
They're telling us where to look.

25
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:09,524
I looked up the radio station.

26
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:12,367
…where the song is coming from.

27
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:23,082
It's an island!

28
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,008
I can follow the train tracks…

29
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,859
It's not even one day.

30
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,349
Then I can find a boat.

31
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,556
You can't do this.

32
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:39,966
If I can find the song.
Where it's coming from…

33
00:34:40,058 --> 00:34:41,632
I can use this…

34
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,538
to change this…

35
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:47,196
into this!

36
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:52,690
Mom, will never… let you go.

37
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:59,385
I can save them.

38
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,926
I can save us.

39
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,891
I'll tell her.

40
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,374
Mom… I'll tell her.

41
00:35:08,712 --> 00:35:10,899
Please don't do this!

42
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,908
I need to try.

43
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:16,230
Why?

44
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:18,179
Because Dad would.

45
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:20,366
And look what happened to him.

46
00:43:57,271 --> 00:44:01,359
Enunciate… Remember?

47
00:44:30,689 --> 00:44:31,957
Help me.

48
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:42,727
What home?

49
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:50,797
You said…your wife…

50
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,093
You said…

51
00:45:02,356 --> 00:45:05,779
…that you could not do enough.

52
00:45:07,903 --> 00:45:11,635
Now you can.

53
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:34,837
I found a boat.

54
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:40,734
Don't go.

55
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,737
I will be right back.

56
00:49:45,685 --> 00:49:47,482
A matter of hours.

57
00:49:48,072 --> 00:49:50,079
But the baby, I don't know how--

58
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,285
I showed you how to do it.

59
00:49:53,868 --> 00:49:55,549
Stay calm.

60
00:49:56,647 --> 00:49:58,979
You have everything you need.

61
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:01,535
Everything.

62
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:05,174
Please…

63
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:08,434
Look…

64
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:11,192
If I don't go…

65
00:50:11,514 --> 00:50:14,623
Soon you'll be in a lot of pain.

66
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,291
And I won't know…

67
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:24,977
… I won't lose you too.

68
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,394
Breathe…

69
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:40,290
I'll be right back.
