1
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:20,710
(blues rock music)

2
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:42,870
- So today makes the big two
- O.

3
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,768
Indeed, my friend.

4
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,056
Could you have imagined that you

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
would work at Carter's
for over 20 years?

6
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:50,671
Well you find something that

7
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,536
works and you just
stick with it.

8
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:54,985
You and Christine
have any plans on

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,229
celebrating the momentous
occasion tonight?

10
00:00:57,298 --> 00:00:58,541
Eh, nothing special.

11
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,163
Probably just order pizza, play

12
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:02,131
some board games with the kids.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,615
Just another day.

14
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:06,214
(Larry) I got a
date tonight myself.

15
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:07,170
(Vaughn) Really?

16
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,447
Yeah, you know that new

17
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:09,528
hygienist from the
dentist's office?

18
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:10,725
Yeah?

19
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:12,624
She totally digs me.

20
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,420
I'm just trying to
decide if I want

21
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:18,733
to splash on Stetson
or Old Spice.

22
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,287
Vaughn!

23
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:23,083
Mr. Carter wants to see you
in the office before you go.

24
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,119
Okay, I'll be there in a second.

25
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,465
Nice!

26
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:27,880
Mr. Carter!

27
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:29,054
The boss man!

28
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:32,575
He's probably gonna
give you a bonus.

29
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,818
We're gonna have to let you go.

30
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,166
Effective immediately.

31
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:40,100
Brian's got your
separation papers.

32
00:01:41,998 --> 00:01:44,104
I'm really sorry, Vaughn.

33
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:48,108
I understand.

34
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:50,179
If you wanna come in
tomorrow, there's nobody

35
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:53,630
here, and get your
tools, that'd be okay.

(Partygoers) Surprise!

(cheering)
(party blowers blowing)

56
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,836
Thanks a lot everybody
for coming out.

57
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:14,564
Helping me celebrate my
20th year at Carter's.

58
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:18,119
Turns out though my
20th year was my last.

59
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,468
They let me go.

60
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:24,609
I'm sorry, you guys.

61
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:27,267
Thanks for coming out.

62
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:28,785
(Partygoer) Sorry.

63
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:31,478
(Second Partygoer) Sorry, man.

64
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,625
So you're just gonna take this?

65
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:42,316
I know you got my back, Larry.

66
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,871
You're just being a friend,
but you still got your job.

67
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,080
You need to focus on that.

68
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:55,364
(dramatic tuba music)

69
00:04:55,433 --> 00:05:00,369
Well well, looks like I
got me a brand new ball.

70
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:03,061
Thanks for tracking our
ball down for us, Gibby.

71
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,925
Oh no you didn't!

72
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:06,236
Dad!

73
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,479
What?

74
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:09,170
He's trying to take my new ball.

75
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:12,622
(suspenseful tuba music)

76
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:19,008
Is there a problem
here, poindexter?

77
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,182
No, there's no problem.

78
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:25,566
Gibby, you can keep the ball.

79
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:27,188
That's what I thought.

80
00:05:27,257 --> 00:05:29,398
Now listen, I know that you've

81
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:32,642
been mowing this
section of my yard.

82
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,060
What you need to know
is we're getting a pool.

83
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,098
I need this section
of my yard back.

84
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,066
Okay, Roland.

85
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,242
Okay.

86
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,278
Of course it's okay.

87
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,763
You're dismissed.

88
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:51,798
Run along.

89
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:57,287
What a pansy.

90
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,014
Always has been, always will be.

91
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:05,779
(upbeat acoustic guitar music)

92
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:09,092
So I'm unemployed.

93
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,269
I've never not had a job.

94
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:16,617
Honey, listen.

95
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,550
Do not let this get you down.

96
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:21,001
We aren't in any danger here.

97
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,832
We've been married 14 years.

98
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,835
We've never taken a vacation.

99
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,872
I just lost my job.

100
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,563
I'm not Chuck
Norris, I can't just

101
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,185
roundhouse kick the classifieds

102
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:35,602
and have the job
drop out of them.

103
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:36,982
Vaughn, relax.

104
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,640
Relax, how can I relax?

105
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,815
What if I were to stroke out?

106
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,093
You don't even have a
family history of strokes.

107
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,267
Well those things come
from somewhere don't they?

108
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,684
They strike without a notice.

109
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,272
And now we don't have
health insurance.

110
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:52,619
This could be just the thing

111
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:54,034
you need to change everything.

112
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,103
Change?

113
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,073
There's just so
much more out there.

114
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,076
I love you, you know that.

115
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:07,530
The thing is, you sell yourself
short over and over again.

116
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:09,394
You don't...

117
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,154
I don't...

118
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,293
I don't what?

119
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,711
Time was, and I didn't
give you any good

120
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,954
reason for it, but
I knew at least you

121
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:21,958
believed in me, but I
guess that's changed huh?

122
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,650
I can't deal with this.

123
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:24,927
I gotta go clear my head.

124
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,963
Vaughn, wait!

125
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:29,725
You know that's
not what I meant.

126
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:35,869
(whispers) I'll talk to him.

127
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,254
Then she says oh now
we can go on vacation.

128
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:44,636
I can't go on a vacation.

129
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:47,501
I've gotta figure out where
to apply for the food stamps,

130
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,296
map out all the
soup kitchens, and

131
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:51,712
find some of those
free health clinics.

132
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:55,129
I gotta prepare for life
on the outside of society.

133
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,441
I'm sorry, dude.

134
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,063
Relax.

135
00:07:58,132 --> 00:08:00,652
You've had a lot
laid on you today.

136
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,721
Yeah.

137
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,000
Didn't you say you had a date

138
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,693
or something like that tonight?

139
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:07,762
Oh yeah.

140
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,768
Well I figured on account of
the events of the day that...

141
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:14,010
Well the truth is she's gonna

142
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,332
have to take a number, you know?

143
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:16,668
Yeah.

144
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,532
Larry can't be
spreading himself so thin.

145
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,601
'Cause...

146
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:24,607
I got skydiving tomorrow
and I'm going to

147
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,886
the gym and I'm taking
a new MMA class.

148
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,751
MMA?

149
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,272
I had no idea they offered that
kind of stuff down at the Y.

150
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:35,618
Oh yeah.

151
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,138
I mean it's the real deal.

152
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,691
Can't wait to get in that ring

153
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,590
and tap out some
of those clowns.

154
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,835
Like armbar and chokehold
and whatever it takes.

155
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,112
I don't know, dude.

156
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,045
Sounds like a perfect
recipe for a herniated

157
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:53,740
disk or some sciatic nerve
damage if you ask me.

158
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,121
Well it's not for everyone.

159
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,951
The ladies love it though.

160
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,711
Being fierce and all.

161
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:08,064
Can I interest you fellas
in a couple of figurines?

162
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,203
Why?

163
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:10,895
What's so special about them?

164
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:12,552
You purchase one
of these, It'll lead

165
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:15,140
to all your wildest
dreams come true.

166
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,522
I could use a little of that.

167
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,767
How much for two
of those carvings?

168
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,976
That'll take care of it.

169
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,981
Nice doing business with you.

170
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,157
What would you want, Vaughn?

171
00:09:32,226 --> 00:09:33,607
What do you mean?

172
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:36,127
I mean all your wildest
dreams coming true.

173
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,887
What would that
look like to you?

174
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:40,649
I guess pretty much how
things were until today.

175
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:44,722
Wife, kids, a job
which I no longer have.

176
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,620
How about you?

177
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:47,689
Me?

178
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,141
Well I'm living
the dream, broseph,

179
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,764
I mean my Rolodex is
full of numbers of

180
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,941
awesome babes, I'm an
extreme sports athlete.

181
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,806
I still got my good
looks and charm.

182
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,808
I got an apartment,
I'm driving a

183
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:04,638
Pinto which is a
total chick magnet.

184
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:05,812
Really?

185
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:06,881
Oh yeah.

186
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,540
Well man, you've always had
it figured out for yourself.

187
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,577
I'm happy for you.

188
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,787
(dramatic rock music)

189
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,146
Mind if I come
in and grab another

190
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,114
slice of that cake
before I hit the road?

191
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,183
Sure.

192
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:39,983
What's on?

193
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,158
Some western.

194
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,508
I was made for times like that.

195
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:50,132
The open air, horses.

196
00:10:58,243 --> 00:10:59,831
(Peddler) You
purchase one of these,

197
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,627
it'll lead to all your
wildest dreams come true.

198
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,456
(Vaughn) I could
use a little of that.

199
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,089
(Peddler) (echoing) You
purchase one of these,

200
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:08,633
it'll lead to all your
wildest dreams come true.

201
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:10,842
(Vaughn) (echoing) I
could use a little of that.

202
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:12,717
(Peddler) (distorted)
You purchase one of these,

203
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:15,191
it'll lead to all your
wildest dreams come true.

204
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,402
(Vaughn) (distorted) I
could use a little of that.

205
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:23,717
(western twang music)

206
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:30,724
(Larry) (mutters) Shiny.

207
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:31,863
Get off me.

208
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,521
Air conditioning.

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,834
Get off me, dude.

210
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,076
Larry!

211
00:11:38,145 --> 00:11:39,629
I'm still tired!

212
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,606
We're outside!

213
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:55,266
(Larry) We're in the desert!

214
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,545
You're dressed like
Charles Ingalls!

215
00:11:58,614 --> 00:12:00,305
This is a dream!

216
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,168
No.

217
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,100
We're just dreaming!

218
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:02,963
No!

219
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:03,930
No, check it.

220
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,483
Just punch me in the face.

221
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,830
I never get hurt in my dreams.

222
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,658
No!

223
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,730
Just punch me, Vaughn!

224
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,183
(restrained screaming)

225
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,949
You punched me in the forehead!

226
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,710
Well this isn't a dream.

227
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,332
No.

228
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:29,058
No, we've been drugged.

229
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,681
We've been kidnapped and we've
been dumped in this desert.

230
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,340
I think someone
slipped us some roofies.

231
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,377
I've seen this on Dateline.

232
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:38,758
Really?

233
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,414
Somebody kidnaps two grown men,

234
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,175
flies them across the country,

235
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,556
dresses them like
Butch Cassidy and the

236
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,042
Sundance Kid, and leaves
them in the desert to die?

237
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:49,561
You have not seen
this on Dateline.

238
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,493
How.

239
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,978
- Ah!
- Oh my gosh!

240
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,255
Who is that guy?

241
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,635
You don't recognize me?

242
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:56,568
I've never seen you before.

243
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,674
You sure about that?

244
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:01,125
It's the figurine guy!

245
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:04,404
He pushed us all the
way out here in his cart?

246
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:07,372
And this is supposed to be
our wildest dreams come true?

247
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:08,926
What a ripoff!

248
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,652
No no no no, this
is no dream come true.

249
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,723
This guy has drugged us!

250
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,211
Okay, Indian cart pushing,
trinket selling guy!

251
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Oh it's on!

252
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,491
It's on like Donkey Kong, yeah!

253
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,873
I was made for a time like this!

254
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,496
Let's get this
thing going, Tonto!

255
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:30,671
Relax, Larry, before
you hurt yourself.

256
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,259
Yeah, I know your name.

257
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,952
I know your name too, Vaughn.

258
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:37,540
Larry Maizel, born
to Marshall and Ester

259
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:41,061
on June 20th, 1973,
in Fairdale, Kentucky.

260
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:46,135
You like long walks on the
beach, romantic comedies,

261
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:48,862
puppies, nice clothes,
candlelight dinner.

262
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:50,484
Okay, that'll do!

263
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:54,695
He cracked into
my dating profile.

264
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,180
Is nothing sacred?

265
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:59,631
Don't you think you
owe us an explanation?

266
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,841
You two have been
watched, measured,

267
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,739
and found wanting,
but you've been

268
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:06,500
born to such a
time just as this.

269
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,055
I'm sorry, you've got us, or

270
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:11,264
at least me mixed up here.

271
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,266
Mr...

272
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,405
Keezheekoni.

273
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:17,028
Okay, Mr. Keyzucchini.

274
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:18,098
Keezheekoni.

275
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,031
Cheyenne for burning fire.

276
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,516
Okay, Mr. Keezheekoni, we are

277
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:24,933
not the right person for your...

278
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,486
Special chosen task.

279
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:29,109
Yes, yes, your
special chosen task.

280
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,249
Listen, I'm a loser.

281
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,493
I just got fired from my job.

282
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:34,943
Please, just put me back on the

283
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:38,187
couch where you found
me, that'd be great.

284
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,948
You're just the right person

285
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:42,778
and you're gonna
help him, Larry.

286
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,473
What have I done to
you, Mr. Keyzucchini?

287
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,924
You answer me that right now!

288
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,720
You two will mount and
ride these horses due

289
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,033
west 'till you come to
the town of Pumpkinville.

290
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:59,933
No no no no no no, we
just want to go home!

291
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:02,108
People of Pumpkinville need you,

292
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:05,559
you need them, and you
need to heal the town.

293
00:15:05,628 --> 00:15:08,010
You have two weeks
to complete the task.

294
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,013
If you don't, you'll
never return home.

295
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,670
Heal the town?

296
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,327
What does that even mean?

297
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,329
"Heal the town."

298
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:17,847
You'll figure it out, fellas.

299
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,090
Two weeks.

300
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,437
Well where are we?

301
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,819
You're in the Arizona territory.

302
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:25,855
You mean to tell me
that you have dragged

303
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,066
us out here across
state lines to Arizona?

304
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:32,000
No, Arizona's still decades
away from being a state.

305
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:36,038
It's 1875, the clothes you're
wearing, modern attire.

306
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,006
You better get riding.

307
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,939
Stay on this road right here.

308
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:43,425
Eventually you'll
reach Pumpkinville.

309
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:45,323
Wait, wait, wait
wait wait, don't you

310
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:48,602
think this is all
just a little ridi...

311
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,881
Dear Lord.

312
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,576
That man practices
the dark arts.

313
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:59,959
(low tempo piano music)

314
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,790
This has gotta be
some kind of a joke.

315
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:06,793
We're just supposed to get
on those and ride due west?

316
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,829
Which way is west?

317
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:12,178
Not like these babies
are outfitted with any kind of a GPS.

318
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:16,561
Did you see that man appear
and disappear out of thin air?

319
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,630
I saw it.

320
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Cool.

321
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:25,846
You know, he said it was 1875.

322
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,401
How's that even possible?

323
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,093
Just gonna have to get
on these things and ride.

324
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:32,439
How do you get up there?

325
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,828
I guess you just
try to put a foot

326
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:37,306
in here and throw a
leg over or something.

327
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,485
(blues rock music)

328
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,980
Hey Vaughn, I'm up here.

329
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:58,154
Yeah.

330
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,297
Hey, is this how you steer it?

331
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:03,643
I don't think so, buddy.

332
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:07,267
I think you might be
up there the wrong way.

333
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:12,100
(western orchestral music)

334
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:41,706
Hey, you think that's
our town up there?

335
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:45,572
It's either that or
it's another ghost town.

336
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,068
How do you figure
we're gonna settle

337
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,301
in there when we
get to Pumpkinville?

338
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,235
Figure out what needs to happen
to get ourselves back home.

339
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:54,650
I don't know, I think we're just

340
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,687
gonna have to take
it as it comes.

341
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,930
We can get up there and
see if they have a church.

342
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,518
Why's that?

343
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:03,694
Ever heard of a little
hamlet called Walnut Grove?

344
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:05,868
Why does that sound familiar?

345
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,387
Little House on the Prairie?

346
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,456
Oh, okay.

347
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,460
I mean I've seen
every episode of that

348
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,704
show at least twice,
and if this is the

349
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:17,501
1870s, my knowledge
is gonna be gold!

350
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,916
How do you figure that?

351
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:20,331
Well I've studied them.

352
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,584
I know their customs, I know how

353
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:24,646
to communicate
with these people.

354
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:26,234
Well hopefully
you know how to talk

355
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:27,590
to these people a
little bit better

356
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:30,928
than you know how
to take a punch.

357
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,032
Come on.

358
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,310
The church.

359
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,597
Let's get down there
and see if they've

360
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:35,840
got a reverend, see
if he can help us out.

361
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:36,623
All right.

362
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,177
Come on.

363
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:41,318
(country rock music)

364
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,203
What's the name of
this town, youngin'?

365
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:06,066
This here's Pumpkinville.

366
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,585
(Vaughn) We made it.

367
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:10,036
Hey, do you know a place
we might be able to stay?

368
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,038
The hotel's been shut
down for about a year,

369
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:15,731
but you can go see
Emilia at the mercantile.

370
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,631
(Larry) Much obliged.

371
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,184
Where'd you get that coin?

372
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,221
Found it in my pocket.

373
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:32,954
Whoa.

374
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:35,682
(Vaughn) Hello.

375
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:38,306
We were looking for Emilia,
is this the right place?

376
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,342
Sure is, Emilia's my mother.

377
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,619
She'll be back any minute.

378
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:42,827
How can I help you?

379
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,553
We was wondering, half pint,

380
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,175
if you might have
a place where we

381
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,178
can hang our hat for
a night's rest or two?

382
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,595
Can I help you two
gentlemen with something?

383
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:52,744
They were inquiring about a

384
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,356
place to stay for a few nights.

385
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,910
You aren't in the
willows are you?

386
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,085
Running from the law.

387
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,535
No!

388
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:01,812
Mother.

389
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,158
I have every right to know what

390
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:05,954
these two strangers
claim to be up to.

391
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,611
Ma'am, we're from back east

392
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,199
and we're only passing through.

393
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,064
Listen, we've had
a week's long ride

394
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,654
and we're just looking
to rest for a spell.

395
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,900
All right, well Laura
will get you settled then.

396
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:21,969
Gentlemen.

397
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,699
Please excuse mama,
she's been raising

398
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:28,908
my brother and I
for years since pa

399
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:31,945
passed on and she can
be quite suspicious.

400
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,533
That's fine.

401
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:35,086
We understand.

402
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,605
Take these two up to the cabin

403
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:39,367
and see that they
get settled in.

404
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,620
Well here it is.

405
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:52,873
If you need anything
you can go see

406
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:54,796
Mrs. Henderson or Laura
at the mercantile.

407
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:57,074
Hey, do you know where we
can find a church around here?

408
00:21:57,143 --> 00:22:00,249
Yeah, there's Doxology Work
on the east side of town.

409
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,044
Great, is there
a minister there?

410
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,253
Yup, Reverend Callaghan.

411
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:15,954
Whoa.

412
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:21,995
Would you look at this place.

413
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,032
Amazing, isn't it?

414
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:28,243
Yeah, amazing breeding ground
for brown recluse spiders.

415
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:33,455
This is just like
Mr. Tucker's place.

416
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:35,319
Little House?

417
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:38,322
Stayed in a cabin
just like this.

418
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,980
Listen, I'm really happy you're

419
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,430
getting a chance
to relive some of

420
00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:44,949
your childhood TV
viewing memories,

421
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:47,158
but the clock is ticking.

422
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:48,343
We gotta figure
out what we gotta

423
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,507
do to get up out of this place.

424
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:52,025
I hear you.

425
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:53,658
But when in Rome, you
gotta blend in with

426
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:57,652
the Romans, we gotta take
stock of the locality!

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,278
This bed isn't half bad.

428
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,211
About the "when
in Rome" business.

429
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,740
You think there's any
chance that you might

430
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:09,111
be able to go a little
bit easy on the isms?

431
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,493
You can't be calling
people half pint.

432
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,012
Relax!

433
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:14,876
Life's a journey, my brother.

434
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,912
We're gonna find
our way outta here.

435
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:20,122
We just need to enjoy
the ride a little.

436
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:23,712
Yeah, I'm gonna "enjoy
the ride" outta here.

437
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:27,026
This place is Walnut
Grove made over.

438
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,720
You know what, we oughta see
if we can find a Doc Baker.

439
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,515
Doc Baker.

440
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,516
Yeah, he was the town's...

441
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,276
He was the town's doctor.

442
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:37,968
Doctors heal right?

443
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,487
They diagnose a
problem, they come up

444
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:42,835
with a remedy, and they
deliver the medicine.

445
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:44,561
I know what we need to do!

446
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,045
Yeah, we need to find a creek or

447
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:48,150
a bath and change
into some new threads.

448
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,462
That's my suggestion.

449
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:52,361
No no no, he said the
town needs to be healed.

450
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,711
So the town would
need to be sick

451
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,744
or broken or something
like that right?

452
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:56,676
Okay.

453
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:57,953
(Vaughn) Yeah, well that's it.

454
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,379
We figure out what
the town's problem

455
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:01,992
is and we do whatever
it takes to solve it.

456
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,580
Exactly!

457
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:06,099
And you can't do that
without understanding them.

458
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,594
See, that's why I've
been using the whole

459
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:10,414
lingo thing so we can
connect with these folk.

460
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,589
I see where you're coming from.

461
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:15,764
Well then, let's find
this Doxology Works and

462
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:19,975
Reverend Callaghan and let's
get this show on the road.

463
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,188
Would you look at this place?

464
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,088
It's a small town.

465
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,330
Small church.

466
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:33,057
Could fit 10, maybe
20 people in here.

467
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:35,474
35 if you stack
them in correctly.

468
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:36,336
Reverend?

469
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:37,579
Callaghan.

470
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:39,108
And who do I have the
pleasure of meeting?

471
00:24:39,132 --> 00:24:41,514
My name is Larry and
this is my partner Vaughn.

472
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,654
Nice to meet you fellas,
just passing through?

473
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:46,450
No, we plan to be
here for a week or two.

474
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:47,347
That so?

475
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:49,073
What's the occasion?

476
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,455
Well we're...

477
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:55,044
Here...

478
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:58,427
To do a little research.

479
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:02,017
We're writing a story
about the town for...

480
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:05,434
For a...

481
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,747
A benefactor, a
benefactor back east,

482
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:12,131
where we're from, and
we thought we would...

483
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,030
We're gonna just be
here for a week or two,

484
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:16,549
we're gonna file our story, and

485
00:25:16,618 --> 00:25:18,309
we're just right
back outta here.

486
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:19,828
(Callaghan) No
need to rush, fellas.

487
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:21,899
You make lodging arrangements?

488
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:23,729
Yeah, we have.

489
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:27,664
Yesterday we met Laura and
Emilia down at the mercantile.

490
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,114
They've let us rent their cabin.

491
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:32,634
You're in good hands in Emilia.

492
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,583
You should meet some of
the people here in town.

493
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:36,224
Get the lay of the land.

494
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,960
I can show you around
and introduce you to folk if you like.

495
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:39,227
Sounds great.

496
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:44,715
(Callaghan) This is Elijah
Woods, our blacksmith.

497
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:45,544
Nice to meet you.

498
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:46,372
Nice to meet you.

499
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:47,580
Nice to meet you.

500
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:48,857
Vaughn and Larry are here to do

501
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:50,583
a story for a paper
back in Louisville.

502
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,067
Careful, that might be hot!

503
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:53,136
Gosh!

504
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:54,897
Darn it!

505
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:58,015
You wanna draw a little bit
more attention to yourself?

506
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,178
Well there should've been a

507
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,767
railing or a warning sign there.

508
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:03,907
Sorry, long day of travel.

509
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:04,976
Boys.

510
00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:06,875
Thanks, Elijah.

511
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:07,980
Nice to meet you boys.

512
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,050
Take care.

513
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:17,230
This here's Sebastian,
our town Deputy.

514
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,818
Sebastian, meet
Vaughn and Larry.

515
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:22,511
They're staying at the
Henderson cabin for a few weeks.

516
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,203
I got five beans in a wheel here

517
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:27,482
and I won't hesitate
to let them loose.

518
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:31,969
I think you made your point.

519
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:34,903
Well nice to meet
you, Sebastian.

520
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:39,321
Hope to see you
around real soon.

521
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:43,187
What is his problem?

522
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:45,742
Never mind him, he just
needs to feel important.

523
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,536
That's just his way.

524
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,436
Fact is, we don't
even have a sheriff.

525
00:26:50,505 --> 00:26:52,334
He's actually deputy to no one.

526
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,199
We just allow him to
amble into that role.

527
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,268
Figures.

528
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,514
You're acquainted
with the mercantile.

529
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:02,344
Well thanks for showing
us around, Reverend.

530
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,175
You're in good hands
here with Emilia.

531
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:06,728
Sunday service is at 8.

532
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,937
Can I expect to see both
of you in attendance?

533
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:09,869
We'll be there, Reverend.

534
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:10,938
Sure.

535
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,950
You break anything,
you've bought it.

536
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:24,228
Yes ma'am, I'm sorry.

537
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:28,439
Larry, why don't you just go
wait outside, I've got this.

538
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:35,067
(gentle piano music)

539
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,010
Howdy, ma'am.

540
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,494
Hola.

541
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,185
My name is Rosa.

542
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,566
What's your name, senor?

543
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:53,499
My name's Larry.

544
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:55,915
Laurence, my name's Laurence.

545
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:57,779
Laurence, si?

546
00:27:57,848 --> 00:27:59,539
Yes, Desert Rose.

547
00:27:59,608 --> 00:28:01,783
My name is Laurence.

548
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:05,925
And Laurence is very
pleased to meet you.

549
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:07,996
Where are you from, Laurence?

550
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,481
I saw you talking with
my father this morning.

551
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,931
Who's your father?

552
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,553
My father's Reverend
Callaghan, I...

553
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:16,108
You're Reverend
Callaghan's daughter?

554
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:18,110
He told me so much about you.

555
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:19,214
Yes?

556
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,422
Yeah.

557
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,217
What have you heard?

558
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:24,668
Well that your name's Rose.

559
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:26,807
And that...

560
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:29,328
He's a minister.

561
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:31,502
And...

562
00:28:31,571 --> 00:28:33,470
(Sebastian) Hey!

563
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:34,747
Back away!

564
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:36,853
Just back away right now!

565
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:41,996
This scoundrel
bothering you, Rosie?

566
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:43,445
Just tell me.

567
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,826
Tell me now and my swift hand

568
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:47,277
of justice will fall like rain.

569
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:49,658
Sebastian, go back
to your jailhouse.

570
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,455
I don't like you
shouting at my friend.

571
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,561
We'll see about this, Larry.

572
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,563
His name is Laurence.

573
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,015
(Sebastian) Perfect.

574
00:29:01,084 --> 00:29:03,017
Spreading an alias
already I see,

575
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:05,191
well I had a feeling deep in my

576
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,469
craw you's a no good varmint.

577
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:11,577
That's enough, go back
and mind your jailhouse.

578
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:18,066
That's the second time
with that guy today.

579
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,723
What's his problem?

580
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:23,313
Don't worry about him,
he doesn't mean any harm.

581
00:29:23,382 --> 00:29:24,624
Hey Larry!

582
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,903
Got some groceries,
you ready to go man?

583
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:30,044
Come here, I want
you to meet Rose!

584
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:36,050
Rose, this is my partner Vaughn.

585
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,155
Rose here's the
reverend's daughter.

586
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:40,537
Oh, well nice to meet you, Rose.

587
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:42,781
Your father's been very helpful.

588
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,853
Yes, that is my father's
way, very helpful.

589
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:47,751
Hope we'll be seeing
you around again.

590
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,270
Yes, I look forward to it.

591
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,719
(Vaughn) All right.

592
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,170
We'll see you, Desert Rose.

593
00:30:03,525 --> 00:30:06,597
You think that deputy's
got a screw loose?

594
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,840
(Larry) Oh he does.

595
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,393
I mean he came up
to me all crazy

596
00:30:09,462 --> 00:30:11,085
like when you were in the store.

597
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:14,467
When I was working
my magic on Rosa.

598
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:15,986
Listen, I'm
completely not trying

599
00:30:16,055 --> 00:30:17,574
to tell you what
to do man, but you

600
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:19,403
know she's not our
main goal here right?

601
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:21,681
I got you, I just,
there's nothing

602
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,176
wrong with getting
to know people while

603
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,720
we're trying to sort
all this stuff out.

604
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,998
(Vaughn) I agree.

605
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:29,689
I know you're an
enjoying the journey

606
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:31,968
type of a guy, right,
and that's fine.

607
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,037
It's just...

608
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:37,283
I keep thinking about Christine.

609
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:38,871
I wonder what she's thinking.

610
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,079
Have the kids.

611
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:42,540
Well you know what
man, just as easy

612
00:30:42,564 --> 00:30:44,187
as we were whisked
out here, that

613
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:48,087
Keezheekoni guy, he
can get us back home.

614
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:49,986
The reverend was
saying that they used to

615
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:52,954
have a restaurant, the
town used to have a hotel.

616
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,311
Makes me wonder, it
doesn't seem like

617
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,855
this town is quite
what it used to be.

618
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,235
Yeah, but towns like this popped

619
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,927
up all the time back in the day

620
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,549
and then they just disappeared.

621
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:03,907
I mean you saw all those ghost
towns when we were riding in.

622
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:04,793
Yeah.

623
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,519
I wonder what happened to them.

624
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:08,211
I don't know, I
think they were just

625
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,869
old mining towns, or
maybe the well ran dry,

626
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:15,045
or I dunno, maybe people
just went to other towns.

627
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,257
Bon appetite.

628
00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:24,537
Well that was...

629
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:25,607
Delicious!

630
00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:30,716
I mean we just had our
first meal on the frontier.

631
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,166
Loved it.

632
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:34,616
Well I'm glad you liked it.

633
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,967
Dude, I am wiped out.

634
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:42,728
I'm gonna get some shuteye.

635
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:44,143
I'm right with you.

636
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:45,692
We got church tomorrow
and I gotta get

637
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:49,735
my beauty rest so I
can look good for Rosa.

638
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:50,804
Whatever.

639
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:57,536
(upbeat woodwind music)
(clock ticking)

640
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:16,451
(gentle piano music)

641
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:55,249
I gotta figure this out.

642
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:03,498
This morning we
look at Moses who

643
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,156
was the greatest man
in the Old Testament.

644
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:09,504
Moses got the 10
commandments from God.

645
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:12,300
Moses wrote the first
five books of the bible.

646
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,233
He led the people from Israel,

647
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:17,512
out of captivity and
slavery, in Egypt.

648
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:21,930
Why was God so effective
in His use of Moses?

649
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,624
Because Moses made some
choices in his life.

650
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:28,247
So we see Moses ask who am I.

651
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:29,904
What are my choices?

652
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:32,941
What's important to my
life, what are my goals?

653
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,426
And in closing, my
final exhortation

654
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,118
to you is accept responsibility.

655
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:40,535
Like Moses, you
make some choices.

656
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,272
No matter what happened
to you in the past,

657
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:44,746
you have the freedom to choose
how you're going to respond.

658
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,135
Never take your
eyes off the goal,

659
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:48,440
get a clear vision,
find God's purpose

660
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:51,098
for your life, and
focus in on it.

661
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,202
Take chances.

662
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:55,067
Never, ever give up.

663
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,691
(jazzy piano music)

664
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,383
Wonderful sermon, Reverend.

665
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:04,180
Thank you, (mumbles).

666
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,664
Good to see you, Wilbur.

667
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:07,435
I'll be over next week to
check on that fence of yours.

668
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,459
Okay.

669
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:10,979
Very nice message, papa.

670
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,189
Thank you, sweetheart.

671
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:15,087
Nice to see you boys.

672
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:16,537
Good to have you as guests.

673
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:20,575
It's nice to be a
guest, Reverend and Rosa.

674
00:34:20,644 --> 00:34:22,439
It's such a gift to behold such

675
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:25,408
a beautiful face
on a gorgeous day.

676
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,795
Of course, nice to
meet you again, Rosa.

677
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,349
Could you boys
do us the honor of

678
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,799
having a picnic lunch
with Rosa and I?

679
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:38,938
Absolutely!

680
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:41,976
We'd love to.

681
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:47,119
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

682
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:03,515
(piano accompaniment)

683
00:35:09,935 --> 00:35:12,248
So tell us about your
lives back in Louisville.

684
00:35:12,317 --> 00:35:15,078
Well we work together on...

685
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,528
Carriages.

686
00:35:16,597 --> 00:35:19,393
On the side we do
that, but my main pursuit

687
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:22,810
is to be a hot air balloon
owner and operator.

688
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,949
(Callaghan) Really?

689
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,778
How interesting.

690
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:27,987
That and I'm an inventor.

691
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,197
Yeah, you sure are.

692
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,612
So how does that fit in with

693
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:33,407
the story you're
doing about our town?

694
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:34,891
Well we've been working together

695
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,308
for the last 20
years on carriages.

696
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:41,553
That all ended right
before we came out here.

697
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:43,037
I see.

698
00:35:43,106 --> 00:35:45,143
From there we got
the opportunity to come

699
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:49,112
out here, the offer
that you can't refuse.

700
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,357
Some of my background
is in writing.

701
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:55,083
Mainly poems and sonnets.

702
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,260
I did most of my writing
during my stint at Harvard.

703
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:02,229
Do you both have
families back home?

704
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:03,575
Yeah, I do.

705
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,301
A wife and three kids.

706
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,166
You must miss them so
much being away for so long.

707
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:09,926
I'm a single man myself.

708
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:13,309
I've just been so dedicated
to my studies and work and...

709
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:15,794
And all of your
hot air ballooning

710
00:36:15,863 --> 00:36:18,037
and all of your inventions.

711
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:19,763
Of course.

712
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:21,213
I just haven't made the time to

713
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:22,762
take on the duties
of being a husband.

714
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:24,561
Not that I don't want to.

715
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,667
I'm just looking
for the right woman.

716
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:31,292
One to love and care for,
to honor and cherish.

717
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:33,605
("Bridal Chorus" melody)

718
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:37,367
From this day forward
'till death do us part.

719
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,266
We're pleased to
have you with us.

720
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,475
Rosa, would you mind getting
some more water please?

721
00:36:41,544 --> 00:36:42,821
Oh sure, papa.

722
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,823
May I assist you please?

723
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,480
It would be my pleasure.

724
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,689
Why thank you, Laurence.

725
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,494
So are you a famous
man in your town?

726
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:05,395
Being an inventor of things
and having hot air balloon?

727
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:08,881
Nah, well yeah, but
I'm still the same

728
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,334
Laurence as I was before
the fame and fortune.

729
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,198
How about you?

730
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:19,513
What's it like being the
most beautiful woman in town?

731
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:23,033
Laurence, I don't
think such things.

732
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:24,102
Okay.

733
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:27,141
Have you lived here long?

734
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,316
Yes, since I was 15 years old,

735
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:32,250
I moved here with my
father and my mother.

736
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:34,597
My mother, she
got sick and died.

737
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:38,808
I lived here ever since just
taking care of my father.

738
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:42,984
I'm sorry to hear
about your mother.

739
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,331
Yes.

740
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,953
Gracias.

741
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:48,058
Her and papa adopted me from an

742
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:51,096
orphanage when I was
just a little girl.

743
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:53,098
Well I'm glad they did.

744
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,167
Me too.

745
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,136
Enjoyed your sermon
this morning, Reverend.

746
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:58,345
Thank you.

747
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:01,002
That Moses, quite
a character huh?

748
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,281
Indeed, quite a person of faith.

749
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,937
He had some problems
in his life.

750
00:38:05,006 --> 00:38:06,249
Really?

751
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,468
Sure, he didn't
exactly volunteer

752
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:09,804
for the job of saving
all those people.

753
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,461
Had to have been scared.

754
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,187
But he decided he
wasn't going to run.

755
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,154
Just too much at stake.

756
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:17,709
It wasn't easy, but he did it.

757
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:21,920
I guess sometimes the
stakes are just too high.

758
00:38:21,989 --> 00:38:24,509
And failure isn't an option.

759
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,580
I suppose you're right.

760
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:28,513
What can you tell
me about Pumpkinville?

761
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:31,274
Well it was founded
about 20 years ago.

762
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,562
There was an abundance
of wild pumpkins

763
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:36,210
down by the river,
hence Pumpkinville.

764
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,419
That makes sense.

765
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:41,042
Town's fallen on tough
times the last few years.

766
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,527
Really?

767
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:43,838
Six or seven years ago, the

768
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,253
town was bursting with promise.

769
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,566
What do you know
about that deputy fella?

770
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:49,257
You mean Sebastian?

771
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,914
Yeah, he seems...

772
00:38:51,984 --> 00:38:54,124
He seems different.

773
00:38:54,193 --> 00:38:58,094
We went to school together,
I think he tries to be nice.

774
00:38:58,163 --> 00:39:00,061
Seems very interested in you.

775
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,238
Papa says he wants to marry
me, but papa says no way.

776
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:08,276
Well I knew Reverend
Callaghan was a smart man.

777
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,520
(laughing)

778
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,694
You're very funny.

779
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:14,766
(siren wailing)

780
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,907
(country rock music)

781
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,363
Hey, I think I found
what I'm looking for.

782
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:27,572
Well I know I have.

783
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,783
And it comes in a 120 pound
package of Mexican goodness.

784
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,200
What?

785
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:37,823
The Desert Rose, Vaughn.

786
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,480
The DR, baby.

787
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:40,895
(Vaughn) Oh come on.

788
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:43,519
Listen, this whole
heal the town thing.

789
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:46,349
There's this ghost
town slumlord Malachi.

790
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,695
Reverend says the town has been

791
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,456
on decline for years and he lays

792
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:52,597
most of the blame
for that on Malachi.

793
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:53,839
How's that?

794
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,265
Well apparently he
goes around buying

795
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:57,498
up all the land, he
runs the people out.

796
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,776
You remember those ghost
towns we saw on the way in?

797
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:00,845
Mmmhm.

798
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,952
His handiwork.

799
00:40:03,021 --> 00:40:04,332
So this is what I figure.

800
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,655
I know where he's
at, you and me are

801
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,612
gonna ride out there
and talk to Malachi.

802
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:08,899
We're gonna convince him to take

803
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:10,615
his boot off the
town's throat just

804
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:13,169
a little and we'll
be back outta here.

805
00:40:13,238 --> 00:40:14,515
So you're just gonna walk up

806
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:16,034
to this Malachi dude and you're

807
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:19,209
just gonna ask
him to stand down?

808
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:21,626
Now how's that gonna work?

809
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:23,524
I don't know.

810
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:25,802
What would Moses do?

811
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:27,217
WWMD?

812
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:30,013
Yes, WWMD, what would Moses do?

813
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:34,086
Reverend Callaghan's
talk this morning?

814
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:36,261
You weren't paying attention.

815
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,918
No I wasn't.

816
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:40,783
But did you ever see Charlton
Heston in The 10 Commandments?

817
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:42,060
Check it.

818
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:44,372
Snake turns into a staff.

819
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,443
Cue the wind.

820
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:47,134
(whistles)

821
00:40:47,203 --> 00:40:48,756
Lots of people.

822
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:52,760
Hair flowing, beard,
majestic on a mountain.

823
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:55,556
(dramatic orchestral music)

824
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,006
Let my people go!

825
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,979
That was awesome.

826
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,671
Okay, well anyway.

827
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:11,365
So Moses got the call of his
game, you know what he did?

828
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,091
He came out swinging.

829
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,679
That's just what I'm gonna do.

830
00:41:14,748 --> 00:41:16,094
Coming out swinging.

831
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,405
Right right left!

832
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,062
Left right left!

833
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,443
- Bam, bam!
- Yeah!

834
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:21,651
Yeah!

835
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,411
Get in there, beat
him down and make him

836
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,001
tap out and you come
out swinging, bro!

837
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,487
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do!

838
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:33,145
Yeah, and you just get
in there and take a punch!

839
00:41:33,214 --> 00:41:35,803
Oh I don't know about that.

840
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:38,323
No, you just fight!

841
00:41:38,392 --> 00:41:39,704
Listen, do you have any idea

842
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:41,844
how sensitive the
human temple is?

843
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:43,880
One wrong punch
and you're a goner.

844
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:45,123
I just thought you said you

845
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:46,676
weren't gonna take
this lying down.

846
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:48,644
Well I'm not.

847
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:50,000
I know where he's
at and we're gonna

848
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,957
ride out there and
we're gonna see him.

849
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:53,959
That's what I'm
talking about, bro!

850
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:56,030
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

851
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:57,411
We're gonna talk to him.

852
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,760
We're gonna reason, just get him

853
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:00,321
to let up on this
town a little bit and

854
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:04,245
we can be back to
Louisville in a flash.

855
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,143
(bell rings)

856
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:06,972
(Larry) It's on, bro.

857
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:10,079
(country rock music)

858
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:20,641
How can I help you fellas?

859
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,884
Hey, we're about ready to go

860
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,171
on a long trip, I
was wondering if

861
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:24,587
you could take a look
at these guys and

862
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:27,268
make sure they're ready
for the long haul.

863
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,753
Where you off to?

864
00:42:28,822 --> 00:42:31,134
We are off to Pine Hollow.

865
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,312
For your story?

866
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:38,038
We're gonna go see a guy.

867
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:39,453
William Malachi.

868
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,043
Malachi, huh?

869
00:42:43,112 --> 00:42:44,389
Watch yourself.

870
00:42:48,324 --> 00:42:49,324
Oh yeah?

871
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:51,153
Why?

872
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:56,263
Got a reputation for
mayhem and quick on the draw.

873
00:42:58,127 --> 00:43:00,439
Y'all might wanna
get some sidearms.

874
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:01,508
Guns?

875
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:03,476
Yeah.

876
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,657
Are those really necessary?

877
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:13,867
(Elijah) Necessary if you
wanna protect yourselves.

878
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:15,627
Boys be careful.

879
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:16,696
Sweet.

880
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:20,287
I got a killer pair of
chaps to go with these.

881
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:21,529
Thank you.

882
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,153
Shoes are in good
shape, have a good ride.

883
00:43:24,222 --> 00:43:25,223
Thank you.

884
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:30,366
Gunslingers.

885
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:31,435
I knew it.

886
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:40,410
(ragtime piano music)

887
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:46,692
Well...

888
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:48,833
This is it.

889
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:49,937
It sure is.

890
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:06,678
(music dies down)

891
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:14,513
(music starts back up)

892
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:19,484
Howdy, partner.

893
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:22,901
We're looking for
a William Malachi.

894
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,316
Got business with him?

895
00:44:24,385 --> 00:44:26,008
We hope to.

896
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:27,526
Well he's right there, but if

897
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:30,150
I was you boys, I'd be careful.

898
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:33,015
He just said we
need to be careful,

899
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:36,259
let's just leave now and
come back a little later.

900
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:37,709
Come back with what?

901
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:39,918
I don't know, maybe
some backup or something.

902
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:40,747
Backup?

903
00:44:40,816 --> 00:44:42,196
We don't have backup.

904
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,682
Well, you know, a
bigger gun like a howitzer

905
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:47,719
or a Gatling gun or
something, I don't know.

906
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:49,548
We ain't having
no shoot out here.

907
00:44:49,617 --> 00:44:51,033
I never said we were, I just

908
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:53,380
thought maybe he would
respect a bigger gun.

909
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:55,220
Just follow my lead on
this one, I got an idea.

910
00:44:55,244 --> 00:44:57,764
- Let's just go not this time.
- No no, just...

911
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:58,833
Will!

912
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:01,768
William Malachi!

913
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:06,255
Who here's William Malachi?

914
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:07,566
Who's asking?

915
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,292
(Malachi) It's okay.

916
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm Malachi.

917
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:11,950
Pleased to meet you.

918
00:45:12,019 --> 00:45:13,227
(Vaughn) Oh no, don't shoot!

919
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,057
(suspenseful orchestral music)

920
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,196
Easy, easy.

921
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:20,407
That's no way to
treat our guests.

922
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:26,206
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle anybody.

923
00:45:26,275 --> 00:45:27,655
Please sit down.

924
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,105
Thanks so much.

925
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,730
Can I interest
you two in a drink?

926
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,732
Oh no no no, we
wouldn't want to impose.

927
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,010
I'll not hear it.

928
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:39,495
Much obliged, much obliged.

929
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:48,918
Glasses are small.

930
00:45:48,987 --> 00:45:50,368
(Vaughn) (whispers)
Just drink it.

931
00:45:50,437 --> 00:45:52,094
(Larry) Thank you.

932
00:45:57,202 --> 00:45:59,273
(coughs)

933
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,931
Don't drink the tea.

934
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,794
It's rotten.

935
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:03,795
(Vaughn) It's not tea.

936
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:04,865
(Larry) It's tea.

937
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:06,142
This is rotten.

938
00:46:08,455 --> 00:46:09,455
So.

939
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,461
To what do I owe the honor
of making your acquaintance?

940
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,394
Well Mr. Malachi,
we're doing a

941
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:17,913
story for a publication back out

942
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:19,949
east, which is where we're from,

943
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:21,986
and well we decided to settle

944
00:46:22,055 --> 00:46:24,609
in Pumpkinville for a few days.

945
00:46:25,713 --> 00:46:27,129
Interesting choice.

946
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:31,892
Well it's basically the
only town in the area.

947
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:33,445
That so?

948
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:36,724
So tell me, what would be
the purpose of your story?

949
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,623
Well Mr. Malachi, what...

950
00:46:38,692 --> 00:46:40,487
Now let me stop you right there.

951
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:41,660
Call me William.

952
00:46:41,729 --> 00:46:43,145
Please, I insist.

953
00:46:44,077 --> 00:46:45,595
And you two are...

954
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:48,771
My name's Vaughn and
this is my partner Larry.

955
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,773
Let me back up,
gentlemen, and say pleased

956
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:55,157
to meet you and welcome
to our little oasis.

957
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:57,435
Now about this story.

958
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,024
Are you familiar
with the plans for the

959
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:01,957
Southern Pacific Railroad
to come through this area?

960
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:03,406
I am.

961
00:47:03,475 --> 00:47:05,270
Well there's some people in the

962
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:07,963
town that have indicated that...

963
00:47:09,136 --> 00:47:10,413
You've made interest in making

964
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:14,210
sure that the railroad
bypasses Pumpkinville.

965
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:16,903
I have no interest
in the affairs of

966
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:20,251
Pumpkinville or any
proposed line there.

967
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,046
It was mentioned
that you had some role

968
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:25,152
in buying up some land
around Pumpkinville?

969
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:26,878
I respect the
people of that town.

970
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:28,235
I can understand why
they wouldn't wanna

971
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:30,468
circulate an idea that
I would be interested

972
00:47:30,537 --> 00:47:33,643
in taking ownership and
refurbishing their town.

973
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:34,712
Why?

974
00:47:35,714 --> 00:47:37,199
Well such a rumor,
if it were true,

975
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:39,132
and I assure you
that it is not, would

976
00:47:39,201 --> 00:47:41,962
increase the value of their
businesses and holdings.

977
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:44,792
But the fact remains, gentlemen.

978
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,794
I have no interest in
doing business there.

979
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,762
What about hindering business?

980
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:51,592
Absolutely none whatsoever.

981
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,422
Well thank you so much for your

982
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:55,942
time William, it was a
pleasure meeting you.

983
00:47:56,011 --> 00:48:00,187
Well gentlemen, are there
anymore questions I can answer?

984
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:01,809
I don't have any.

985
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:06,953
Thank you so much, sir.

986
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:09,472
See you guys!

987
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:19,310
Well that went well.

988
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,277
Yeah, and you wanted to
bring out the big guns.

989
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:22,796
Whatever.

990
00:48:22,865 --> 00:48:25,626
(dramatic sting)

991
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:30,838
I'm never gonna get that
tea taste outta my mouth.

992
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,948
Tom looked him in the
eye and said, like only Tom

993
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:39,640
could, that's why this town
needs a printing press.

994
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,539
(laughing)

995
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:42,781
That's so funny.

996
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,508
(laughs) Tom.

997
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:48,787
Good man.

998
00:48:48,856 --> 00:48:49,857
Indeed.

999
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,549
Yeah, I miss him.

1000
00:48:51,618 --> 00:48:52,481
I do too.

1001
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,931
We all do.

1002
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,863
The whole town does.

1003
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,453
Place is not the
same without him.

1004
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:01,835
How long since you lost Harriet?

1005
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:03,768
Eight years.

1006
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:05,908
Seems like forever.

1007
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,635
Rosa, come see the new
fabric mother just got in.

1008
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:10,602
Yes, I would love to.

1009
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:14,364
Hello.

1010
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:18,679
Back from your trip already?

1011
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,405
How did you know we were gone?

1012
00:49:20,474 --> 00:49:21,935
You were at the
blacksmith this morning.

1013
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,167
Small town.

1014
00:49:23,236 --> 00:49:24,823
Yeah, guess so.

1015
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:26,135
Pine Hollow was it?

1016
00:49:26,204 --> 00:49:27,654
Yes sir, we went...

1017
00:49:27,723 --> 00:49:31,209
What business do the two
of you have in Pine Hollow?

1018
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:32,279
You see Malachi?

1019
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:33,108
- Yes.
- Yes.

1020
00:49:33,177 --> 00:49:34,626
We did.

1021
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:36,432
Exactly who is it that the
two of you think you are?

1022
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:37,250
Mother.

1023
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:38,492
Emilia.

1024
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:40,080
I just thought we
could go and talk

1025
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:41,840
to him and reason
with him a little.

1026
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:43,911
Oh, and how did
that work out for you?

1027
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,061
Well at first it was a little

1028
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:47,674
dicey, the tea was awful, but...

1029
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:50,366
Yeah, what did you talk about?

1030
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:53,162
Word in town is that you two

1031
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:56,338
have been dealing with Malachi.

1032
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:58,305
Yeah, we just felt we
would ride out there,

1033
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:00,135
reason with him a
little bit, talk to him

1034
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:02,620
about allowing the
train station here.

1035
00:50:02,689 --> 00:50:04,104
He says he has no problem with

1036
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:06,244
Pumpkinville doing
that kind of business.

1037
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:07,556
And he lies.

1038
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,558
He's a bad man.

1039
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:11,836
Maybe, but why would he lie?

1040
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:13,355
Maybe things have changed.

1041
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:15,150
Maybe he's got his
sights set elsewhere.

1042
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:16,530
Could that be possible?

1043
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:17,842
Maybe it is.

1044
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:20,362
Maybe we could get
Roger back out here.

1045
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:21,649
Roger's my old friend that works

1046
00:50:21,673 --> 00:50:22,961
for the Southern
Pacific Railroad.

1047
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:23,986
It's worth a shot.

1048
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:25,781
We could get him back here?

1049
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:28,646
With Malachi out of the way,
we at least have a chance.

1050
00:50:28,715 --> 00:50:31,200
That could be wonderful.

1051
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:32,269
Thank you.

1052
00:50:33,582 --> 00:50:37,241
Well we did what anyone in
our situation would've done.

1053
00:50:39,174 --> 00:50:40,174
Absurd!

1054
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:42,108
Asinine!

1055
00:50:42,177 --> 00:50:43,385
Idiotic people!

1056
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:51,945
(western orchestral music)

1057
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,134
Laurence, it goes here.

1058
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:17,996
Right here?

1059
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:19,964
No, right here silly.

1060
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,484
Oh.

1061
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:25,625
(gentle piano music)

1062
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:33,460
What would you do, Rosa?

1063
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:37,844
If you could do anything,
what would it be?

1064
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,467
I'd want to teach school.

1065
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:42,297
I could totally
see you doing that!

1066
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:43,366
(laughing)

1067
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:45,023
You'd be a great teacher!

1068
00:52:45,092 --> 00:52:46,646
You should do that!

1069
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:51,202
What else would you do?

1070
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:55,033
I'd want to meet my
husband, have a family,

1071
00:52:56,449 --> 00:53:00,004
raise the children, things
like that I suppose.

1072
00:53:00,073 --> 00:53:04,215
Have you considered
anybody that you might marry?

1073
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:06,148
No, not yet.

1074
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:08,288
Emilia says that Mr.
Right will come along

1075
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:12,223
sometime and I'll know
it's him when I see him.

1076
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,918
What about you,
Mr. Question Man?

1077
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:20,921
You've probably done
everything with your

1078
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,063
big inventions, your
balloons, and your studies.

1079
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:27,549
Yeah, I've done a lot.

1080
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:29,654
But I'm thinking that
there's more out there.

1081
00:53:29,723 --> 00:53:31,311
Like what?

1082
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,244
What would you do next?

1083
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:38,111
I wanna be a dancer.

1084
00:53:40,286 --> 00:53:42,184
(laughs) A dancer?

1085
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:43,461
Really?

1086
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,637
Laugh if you will, but
Laurence here can dance.

1087
00:53:46,706 --> 00:53:48,604
He can really dance.

1088
00:53:48,673 --> 00:53:52,229
Yes, well please, let's
see your dance moves.

1089
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:54,300
Well I wish I
could, but there's no

1090
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,060
place to dance in here, and man

1091
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:57,993
I wish we had a
dance hall, but...

1092
00:53:58,062 --> 00:53:59,546
No, you're wrong.

1093
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:01,514
On Thursday we're
having our one year

1094
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:04,551
big dance here at the saloon.

1095
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,829
Everyone's coming from all over.

1096
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:08,624
It's really fun.

1097
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:09,487
Really?

1098
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:11,006
Yes, really.

1099
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:12,490
Can you take me to the dance?

1100
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,768
You can show your dance moves.

1101
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:15,837
Yes.

1102
00:54:16,736 --> 00:54:17,736
Yes I will.

1103
00:54:18,496 --> 00:54:19,496
I'd love to.

1104
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:23,915
Hey, there you are.

1105
00:54:23,984 --> 00:54:25,641
I got some news for you.

1106
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,642
Hi, Rosa.

1107
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,057
Hello, Vaughn.

1108
00:54:28,126 --> 00:54:30,681
I'm so excited about the dance.

1109
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:34,167
Hey, can I talk to you?

1110
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,930
(gentle sax music)

1111
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:46,696
Larry?

1112
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:48,836
Larry.

1113
00:54:50,494 --> 00:54:51,494
Larry!

1114
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:58,571
Dance?

1115
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,744
What dance?

1116
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:01,436
Well they're
having some big thing

1117
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:02,723
here at the end of week and she

1118
00:55:02,747 --> 00:55:04,162
wanted to know if
I'd go with her.

1119
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:05,094
Oh.

1120
00:55:05,163 --> 00:55:07,027
Well hey, I got a plan.

1121
00:55:07,096 --> 00:55:08,350
You and me are gonna ride to the

1122
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:10,376
Southern Pacific
offices in Yuma.

1123
00:55:10,445 --> 00:55:12,354
We're gonna talk them into
building a station here.

1124
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:13,620
I don't know.

1125
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,553
What do you mean you don't know?

1126
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:16,968
It's our ticket outta here.

1127
00:55:17,037 --> 00:55:19,039
We talked Malachi into
changing his mind,

1128
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:20,396
we're gonna do the
same thing with

1129
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,803
the Southern Pacific
Rail Station.

1130
00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:24,976
Well maybe.

1131
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:26,737
Well maybe nothing.

1132
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:28,221
We will!

1133
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,430
We decide what we want, we act,

1134
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:33,502
we focus, and we do this thing.

1135
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,571
Wow!

1136
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,611
Where did Vaughn go?

1137
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,198
Who are you?

1138
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:41,510
Who am I?

1139
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:42,787
I'm the guy that's gonna get a

1140
00:55:42,856 --> 00:55:44,237
ticket out of this place and get

1141
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:47,585
back home to my
family where I belong.

1142
00:55:47,654 --> 00:55:48,654
Back home.

1143
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:51,865
Yeah, back home.

1144
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:55,075
Saddle the horses, buddy.

1145
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,077
We are outta here.

1146
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,941
(train horn blows)

1147
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,152
(electric guitar and piano music)

1148
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:13,922
Here you go.

1149
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:14,819
Thank you, ma'am.

1150
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:16,683
You have a good day.

1151
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,174
We are here to see Roger.

1152
00:56:25,243 --> 00:56:27,245
Send them back please.

1153
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,459
Hi, I'm Vaughn McDaniel.

1154
00:56:33,528 --> 00:56:34,391
Vaughn.

1155
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,978
And this is my partner Larry.

1156
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:37,566
Larry.

1157
00:56:37,635 --> 00:56:40,983
So what business do you have
with Southern Pacific today?

1158
00:56:41,052 --> 00:56:42,295
Well we wanted to talk to you

1159
00:56:42,364 --> 00:56:44,193
about a proposed rail station in

1160
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:46,161
and around the area
of Pumpkinville.

1161
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,025
Okay, go ahead.

1162
00:56:48,094 --> 00:56:49,820
Have plans been made for exactly

1163
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:52,616
where such a station
will be located?

1164
00:56:52,685 --> 00:56:54,859
Well not as of yet.

1165
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:57,103
There seems to be
some dispute as to

1166
00:56:57,172 --> 00:57:00,209
whether the railroad could
obtain workable terms.

1167
00:57:00,278 --> 00:57:02,108
Right, I understand,
and I can assure you

1168
00:57:02,177 --> 00:57:04,559
that those issues had
long since been resolved

1169
00:57:04,628 --> 00:57:06,319
and the town does indeed want to

1170
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:09,287
negotiate with Southern
Pacific Railroad.

1171
00:57:09,356 --> 00:57:10,530
What do you suggest?

1172
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,083
We suggest you
bring more kids to

1173
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:14,879
Pumpkinville so
Rosa can teach them.

1174
00:57:14,948 --> 00:57:16,640
Excuse me?

1175
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:18,262
Our want and desire is that you

1176
00:57:18,331 --> 00:57:20,920
consider renewing a
review as Pumpkinville

1177
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:24,164
as a viable place to
put the rail station.

1178
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:26,719
Now the people are
behind it and they're

1179
00:57:26,788 --> 00:57:28,203
ready to negotiate
terms that are

1180
00:57:28,272 --> 00:57:32,000
favorable for both the
town and the railroad.

1181
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,797
I can be there on Friday,
how does that sound?

1182
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:38,075
That sounds great,
now I assure you sir,

1183
00:57:38,144 --> 00:57:40,733
it is gonna be well
worth your time.

1184
00:57:40,802 --> 00:57:41,941
I'm sure.

1185
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,943
Gentlemen, don't forget.

1186
00:57:44,012 --> 00:57:47,291
Tell the captain the
old war horse is coming.

1187
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,603
You have our word.

1188
00:57:48,672 --> 00:57:49,845
Good day to you.

1189
00:57:49,914 --> 00:57:52,330
- Take care now.
- Thank you, sir.

1190
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:55,782
We are in business, man.

1191
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:59,717
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1192
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:11,142
So I was thinking.

1193
00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:14,456
I could escort you
to the dance tonight.

1194
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:18,529
You wear your best dress,
I'll wear this rugged uniform.

1195
00:58:18,598 --> 00:58:19,875
What do you think?

1196
00:58:19,944 --> 00:58:21,428
I don't think so.

1197
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,603
Not this year, Sebastian.

1198
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:26,157
(laughs)

1199
00:58:26,226 --> 00:58:28,125
Are you playing hard to get?

1200
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:29,885
I see, you pretend
to not wanna go

1201
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:31,680
with me to the dance and I work

1202
00:58:31,749 --> 00:58:34,407
harder trying to convince you.

1203
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:35,891
It's not...

1204
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,516
This pillar of law and
justice does not play games.

1205
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:42,553
It's not like that, silly.

1206
00:58:42,622 --> 00:58:46,730
It's just I've already been
invited to go with someone else.

1207
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:52,390
That someone else
wouldn't happen

1208
00:58:52,459 --> 00:58:55,601
to be that Larry guy, would it?

1209
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:59,536
I'm not sure it's any of your
business, I mean calm down.

1210
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:02,815
I will not stand
for this aggression.

1211
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:08,303
Sebastian gets what he wants
ans Sebastian wants you, Rosie.

1212
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:09,925
What is going on here?

1213
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:13,101
Nothing, papa, no worries.

1214
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,931
This has been a long
time in the making.

1215
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,484
And now I'm ready.

1216
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,695
Sir, I love your daughter.

1217
00:59:22,213 --> 00:59:24,388
She is my soulmate.

1218
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:28,875
I was made to love her and
she was made to love me.

1219
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:31,222
Reverend, today I ask for your

1220
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:33,673
daughter's hand
in holy matrimony.

1221
00:59:33,742 --> 00:59:35,019
Sebastian!

1222
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:36,573
(Sebastian) Sir?

1223
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:38,999
I see your daughter
and I walking down

1224
00:59:39,023 --> 00:59:40,303
the streets protecting this town

1225
00:59:40,335 --> 00:59:43,649
from anybody who
would dare harm it.

1226
00:59:43,718 --> 00:59:45,754
There will be children.

1227
00:59:45,823 --> 00:59:49,206
Lord willing, they'll grow
up to be just like me.

1228
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:50,621
I don't know what to say.

1229
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,174
I know this is a lot to process,

1230
00:59:52,243 --> 00:59:55,384
but the time has
come and we're ready.

1231
00:59:57,145 --> 00:59:58,698
I can't give my permission.

1232
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:00,873
She doesn't want to marry you.

1233
01:00:00,942 --> 01:00:01,942
I'm sorry.

1234
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:12,919
(Sebastian) Okay.

1235
01:00:19,788 --> 01:00:20,824
No.

1236
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:22,688
No, not okay.

1237
01:00:22,757 --> 01:00:24,551
I (mumbles) for all this.

1238
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,174
Coming in town,
ruining my plans,

1239
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:28,694
stirring up so much confusion!

1240
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:35,666
Is it always
something with that guy?

1241
01:00:35,735 --> 01:00:39,049
Hey, I got something
to tell you guys.

1242
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:40,602
Emilia, come here!

1243
01:00:43,778 --> 01:00:45,987
Guess who's coming to town.

1244
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:48,334
Roger!

1245
01:00:48,403 --> 01:00:50,025
Roger McCardy!

1246
01:00:50,094 --> 01:00:51,268
How about that.

1247
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:52,579
How'd you arrange it?

1248
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,340
Well we went to his office and

1249
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:56,929
we talked to him and he agreed.

1250
01:00:58,516 --> 01:01:00,795
(Vaughn) And he's
gonna be here tomorrow.

1251
01:01:00,864 --> 01:01:02,037
Tomorrow?

1252
01:01:02,106 --> 01:01:03,383
This is terrific.

1253
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:05,351
(Emilia) We've gotta
get this place together.

1254
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,673
Laura, go get all
the banners and

1255
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:08,941
have Elijah put
them around town.

1256
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,703
Rosa, make sure all the
boardwalks are swept.

1257
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:15,637
This is what we've
been working for.

1258
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,881
Finally things
are going our way.

1259
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,710
Will I see you at
the dance tonight?

1260
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:21,505
I wouldn't miss it.

1261
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:26,475
(ragtime piano music)

1262
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:40,662
Hey, where's Larry?

1263
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,157
He'll be here in a
minute, I think he's

1264
01:01:42,181 --> 01:01:45,391
got a little something
special planned.

1265
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:01,338
Wow!

1266
01:02:01,407 --> 01:02:03,858
Some costume you
got there, amigo.

1267
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:06,101
(laughing)

1268
01:02:08,897 --> 01:02:10,312
Why don't you get
your dance shoes

1269
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:12,867
out here and show
us what you got.

1270
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:14,247
Hit it, Charles.

1271
01:02:15,455 --> 01:02:18,631
(ragtime piano music)

1272
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:30,677
You look wonderful.

1273
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:34,267
You look very handsome.

1274
01:02:34,336 --> 01:02:35,717
You look handsome too.

1275
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:36,960
I mean beautiful too.

1276
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:41,136
I mean I'm handsome
and you're beautiful.

1277
01:02:41,205 --> 01:02:44,036
Why thank you, Laurence.

1278
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:46,555
Got you this flower.

1279
01:02:46,624 --> 01:02:47,764
Very pretty.

1280
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:53,459
Do you want to dance with me?

1281
01:02:53,528 --> 01:02:54,528
Yes I do.

1282
01:02:56,842 --> 01:02:57,842
Shall we?

1283
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:04,711
May I have this dance?

1284
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,267
(upbeat orchestral music)

1285
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:36,364
Very nice, gringo.

1286
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:42,232
Why don't you show me your
special dancing skills again.

1287
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,130
Show him what you got, cowboy.

1288
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:46,788
Only this time don't hold back.

1289
01:03:59,663 --> 01:04:02,735
Just give me the
best you got, buddy.

1290
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:05,289
(sparkly ring)

1291
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:16,093
(synthesizer pop music)

1292
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:32,618
That was amazing.

1293
01:05:32,687 --> 01:05:34,516
Well I told you I could dance.

1294
01:05:34,585 --> 01:05:36,380
No no, that was incredible.

1295
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:39,004
I thought nobody could
dance better than Sebastian.

1296
01:05:39,073 --> 01:05:40,384
Until you met me.

1297
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:41,696
(chuckling)

1298
01:05:41,765 --> 01:05:42,973
Maybe I would've looked better

1299
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:44,561
if I wore a little
leather vest and a

1300
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:46,252
little pretend
badge and a gun with

1301
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:48,599
five beans in a barrel
just waiting to discharge.

1302
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:51,499
(laughs) Stop it.

1303
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:52,949
You are very funny.

1304
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:54,018
Thank you.

1305
01:05:55,641 --> 01:05:58,230
You're welcome, Laurence.

1306
01:05:58,299 --> 01:06:01,612
I've enjoyed these last few
weeks that we've had together.

1307
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:02,681
Me too.

1308
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:06,893
I think you are so
smart and funny.

1309
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,172
I like being around you.

1310
01:06:09,241 --> 01:06:11,622
I like being around you too.

1311
01:06:11,691 --> 01:06:15,626
I like the way you look, I
like hearing about your dreams.

1312
01:06:15,695 --> 01:06:19,837
I think you're the most
incredible woman I've ever met.

1313
01:06:21,046 --> 01:06:23,220
Thank you for saying that.

1314
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:24,704
That is so sweet.

1315
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,709
I wish you didn't
have to go, I'm going

1316
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:32,747
to miss you so much
when you leave.

1317
01:06:32,816 --> 01:06:34,645
But I know you have
all your inventions

1318
01:06:34,714 --> 01:06:36,785
and your balloons back home.

1319
01:06:36,854 --> 01:06:38,787
I don't care about that.

1320
01:06:38,856 --> 01:06:41,100
If I could, I'd
stay here with you.

1321
01:06:41,169 --> 01:06:42,826
If you'd have me.

1322
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:44,103
I could never ask you to do

1323
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:46,795
that, to just leave everything?

1324
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:48,935
I would if I could.

1325
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,317
I love it out here.

1326
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:55,563
I love the way the moon
shines in your eyes.

1327
01:06:55,632 --> 01:06:58,911
The way it makes your skin glow.

1328
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,326
And I love your outfit that

1329
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,846
you put on tonight
for the dance.

1330
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:04,710
It was very cute.

1331
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:06,125
Did you like my hat?

1332
01:07:06,194 --> 01:07:07,644
Yes.

1333
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:10,026
It was very big and Mexican.

1334
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:13,374
It was a very nice touch.

1335
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:17,216
If there was any
way in the world I

1336
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,450
could swing it, I'd
stay here with you.

1337
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:23,004
I don't know exactly what it is

1338
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:25,144
that we have between
us, but I feel

1339
01:07:25,213 --> 01:07:28,527
like we owe it to
ourselves to find out.

1340
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:33,359
Do what you think
is right, Laurence.

1341
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:36,742
If you can stay,
and it feels right,

1342
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:39,538
then I would like
that very much.

1343
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,368
It makes me very sad to think

1344
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:45,233
of never hearing
your voice again.

1345
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,249
He's coming!

1346
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:04,045
He's coming!

1347
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:05,736
I just saw him back there!

1348
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:08,912
(upbeat piano music)

1349
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,335
There you are.

1350
01:08:18,404 --> 01:08:20,855
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes.

1351
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:23,029
(laughs)

1352
01:08:24,686 --> 01:08:26,205
How you been?

1353
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:27,482
It's been a long time.

1354
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:28,345
It has.

1355
01:08:28,414 --> 01:08:29,588
Yes.

1356
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:32,970
Vaughn, Larry, good
to see you both again.

1357
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:34,593
This place is looking great.

1358
01:08:34,662 --> 01:08:36,605
Let me walk you around and
show you what's been going on.

1359
01:08:36,629 --> 01:08:37,630
Excellent.

1360
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:41,669
(gentle piano music)

1361
01:08:50,436 --> 01:08:51,920
Is that Malachi?

1362
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:54,509
What is he doing here?

1363
01:08:54,578 --> 01:08:56,373
I don't know.

1364
01:08:56,442 --> 01:08:59,031
Probably just dropping
by to say hello.

1365
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:02,241
(ominous piano music)

1366
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:14,805
Well well well.

1367
01:09:14,874 --> 01:09:16,531
What do I find here?

1368
01:09:17,705 --> 01:09:20,466
Y'all didn't have to
gather here in my honor.

1369
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:21,650
Looks like we've
got some business

1370
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:23,435
being conducted here, fellas.

1371
01:09:23,504 --> 01:09:26,886
Did I order any business
to be conducted?

1372
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,614
Funny, I don't
recall that I did.

1373
01:09:30,683 --> 01:09:32,651
I thought I made
it clear that this

1374
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,241
sort of meeting would
require my attendance.

1375
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,277
Since I normally
wouldn't attend such a

1376
01:09:38,346 --> 01:09:42,454
pointless meeting,
such a meeting is entirely unauthorized.

1377
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:49,875
So here's how we're gonna
solve this little problem.

1378
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:54,120
You, Roger, are gonna get back
on that horse you rode in on.

1379
01:09:55,432 --> 01:09:56,744
The rest of you?

1380
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:58,884
I order to return back to your

1381
01:09:58,953 --> 01:10:01,611
meaningless and pointless lives.

1382
01:10:03,095 --> 01:10:05,477
Why don't you back it down
about 10 notches, partner.

1383
01:10:05,546 --> 01:10:06,833
You ain't got no
say in what we're

1384
01:10:06,857 --> 01:10:10,136
doing here, so why
don't you skedaddle?

1385
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,206
I see.

1386
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,351
Well looks like we have
no say-so here, boys.

1387
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,111
I must've been mistaken.

1388
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,288
I guess we should just get
on our horses and skedaddle.

1389
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:27,361
Or on second thought.

1390
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,614
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1391
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,226
(Rosa) Sebastian!

1392
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:33,505
Sebastian.

1393
01:10:33,574 --> 01:10:34,920
Rosie.

1394
01:10:34,989 --> 01:10:36,646
Is that you?

1395
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:37,715
Whoops!

1396
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,857
Did I do that out loud?

1397
01:10:41,858 --> 01:10:44,481
I'm sorry, that was an accident.

1398
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:49,555
I know there's been
"accidents" here before.

1399
01:10:51,143 --> 01:10:52,972
I would hate to see any
other tragedy befall

1400
01:10:53,041 --> 01:10:55,734
this pathetic excuse
for a town, so why don't

1401
01:10:55,803 --> 01:10:59,600
you all just go back to
wherever it is you usually are.

1402
01:10:59,669 --> 01:11:01,912
It'd be your safest option.

1403
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,329
Any objections?

1404
01:11:07,332 --> 01:11:08,332
Wonderful.

1405
01:11:10,024 --> 01:11:13,061
You're free to return
to nothingness.

1406
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:22,485
And you'll do it.

1407
01:11:22,554 --> 01:11:25,211
If you know what's good for you.

1408
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,844
What just happened?

1409
01:11:36,913 --> 01:11:38,880
Malachi just happened.

1410
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:41,952
He wasn't a thing like that
the last time we met him.

1411
01:11:42,021 --> 01:11:44,265
I thought you had
this taken care of.

1412
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:45,818
Yeah, they had it worked out.

1413
01:11:45,887 --> 01:11:48,234
Now he's gonna be back
and burn down the town.

1414
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,788
(Elijah) That's right.

1415
01:11:49,857 --> 01:11:52,138
This was a great place to live
'till you two came to town.

1416
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:53,654
Thanks a lot!

1417
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:56,519
(angry muttering)

1418
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:59,694
(Larry) Oh come on!

1419
01:11:59,763 --> 01:12:00,937
Seriously.

1420
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:03,077
Rosa, wait, wait!

1421
01:12:03,146 --> 01:12:06,701
Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?

1422
01:12:10,809 --> 01:12:12,258
Just a minute.

1423
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,098
These boys aren't to blame
for this, Malachi is.

1424
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:16,435
We can work something out.

1425
01:12:16,504 --> 01:12:18,023
Captain, I'm sorry.

1426
01:12:18,092 --> 01:12:19,990
There are still too many
unresolved issues at

1427
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:23,856
play here for the railroad
to get further involved.

1428
01:12:23,925 --> 01:12:25,617
It's just company policy.

1429
01:12:25,686 --> 01:12:27,515
Sir, if I may
please, I don't know

1430
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:29,137
what Malachi was
doing here, but if

1431
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:31,347
you'd just allow
us another chance.

1432
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,866
I'm afraid that's entirely
out of the question.

1433
01:12:33,935 --> 01:12:35,730
I'm sorry, I really am.

1434
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:38,768
I'm sorry I wasted
your time coming here.

1435
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:41,978
At least allow me to let
you stay at my home tonight.

1436
01:12:42,047 --> 01:12:44,670
I accept, thank you very much.

1437
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:53,438
Hey.

1438
01:12:53,507 --> 01:12:55,198
How's your head?

1439
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:56,820
Awful.

1440
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:58,408
Thanks to you.

1441
01:12:58,477 --> 01:13:00,237
I'm sorry he hit you.

1442
01:13:00,306 --> 01:13:02,274
I know it must've really hurt.

1443
01:13:02,343 --> 01:13:05,070
In fact, I bet you have
a stage three concussion.

1444
01:13:05,139 --> 01:13:07,003
Look, how many fingers
am I holding up?

1445
01:13:07,072 --> 01:13:08,936
Get your hand away from my face!

1446
01:13:09,005 --> 01:13:12,457
Why don't you calm
down, you psychopath?

1447
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:16,806
Don't you insult me.

1448
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:19,222
I have half a mind...

1449
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,637
Do what?

1450
01:13:20,706 --> 01:13:22,328
You feeling froggy?

1451
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,951
Why don't you jump?

1452
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:28,300
Calm down.

1453
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:30,095
(Sebastian) You want some.

1454
01:13:30,164 --> 01:13:31,199
(Mumbles).

1455
01:13:31,268 --> 01:13:32,028
Really?

1456
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:32,891
(Vaughn) Calm down.

1457
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,788
You asked for it.

1458
01:13:33,857 --> 01:13:34,962
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!

1459
01:13:35,031 --> 01:13:36,180
By the power vested in me in the

1460
01:13:36,204 --> 01:13:37,596
territory of Arizona,
and the town of

1461
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:40,105
Pumpkinville, I hereby
place you under arrest!

1462
01:13:40,174 --> 01:13:42,141
(Larry) On what grounds?

1463
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,419
Treason!

1464
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:44,913
Now get them belts
off and turn around,

1465
01:13:44,937 --> 01:13:48,734
you yellow-bellied, don't
you say another word!

1466
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:50,149
Easy, easy.

1467
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:54,153
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1468
01:13:59,883 --> 01:14:03,680
Gather all around,
people, dead men walking!

1469
01:14:05,026 --> 01:14:07,270
(gunshot)

1470
01:14:07,339 --> 01:14:08,961
Dead men walking!

1471
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,998
I said dead men walking!

1472
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,450
Today we's a havin'
us a hanging!

1473
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:15,278
Stop this!

1474
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:16,486
Stop this right now!

1475
01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:18,419
Get back woman, this
don't concern you!

1476
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:20,559
Go find papa right now.

1477
01:14:26,738 --> 01:14:28,291
Get up there, go.

1478
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:56,975
Don't we get any last words?

1479
01:14:57,044 --> 01:14:58,286
I'll allow it.

1480
01:14:58,355 --> 01:14:59,667
Make them brief.

1481
01:15:04,707 --> 01:15:07,157
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here

1482
01:15:07,226 --> 01:15:10,195
today, in the
presence of this town.

1483
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:13,716
I don't wanna die!

1484
01:15:13,785 --> 01:15:16,063
(sobbing)

1485
01:15:16,132 --> 01:15:19,376
The only thing that
we have to fear...

1486
01:15:19,445 --> 01:15:20,688
Is fear itself.

1487
01:15:24,209 --> 01:15:26,522
Four score and 20 years ago.

1488
01:15:29,904 --> 01:15:31,147
I have a dream!

1489
01:15:32,907 --> 01:15:36,808
A dream that's deeply rooted
in the American dream.

1490
01:15:36,877 --> 01:15:37,636
Today!

1491
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:39,086
(Larry) Day, day, day.

1492
01:15:39,155 --> 01:15:40,363
I consider myself!

1493
01:15:40,432 --> 01:15:42,261
'Self, 'self, 'self.

1494
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,330
The luckiest man!

1495
01:15:43,366 --> 01:15:44,678
Man, man, man.

1496
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,476
One small step for
mankind and one giant...

1497
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,755
Oh enough of your babbling!

1498
01:15:52,824 --> 01:15:54,284
No one understands
what you're saying or

1499
01:15:54,308 --> 01:15:56,897
wants to watch you
cry, you yellow sissy!

1500
01:15:56,966 --> 01:15:59,416
Where's the lever on this
thing, on the count of three.

1501
01:15:59,485 --> 01:16:00,935
Here we go, one...

1502
01:16:01,004 --> 01:16:04,076
Oh mercy, I haven't
had a chance to live!

1503
01:16:04,145 --> 01:16:05,353
(Sebastian) Two!

1504
01:16:05,422 --> 01:16:06,838
What do you think
you're doing here?

1505
01:16:06,907 --> 01:16:08,540
Stop it this instant,
Sebastian Walker, before I

1506
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,945
take you over my knee
and give you a what for.

1507
01:16:11,014 --> 01:16:12,706
Back away from there now.

1508
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:14,200
The charge is
treason and the penalty

1509
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:17,089
is death, am I
right or am I right?

1510
01:16:19,195 --> 01:16:23,233
I say am I right or
am I right, come on!

1511
01:16:23,302 --> 01:16:25,201
Sebastian, it's over.

1512
01:16:32,035 --> 01:16:33,219
You know, with you here, we'll

1513
01:16:33,243 --> 01:16:35,694
never get to use these things.

1514
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:01,271
What a debacle.

1515
01:17:02,514 --> 01:17:04,136
You think?

1516
01:17:04,205 --> 01:17:05,344
Yeah.

1517
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:06,829
All that had to happen was Roger

1518
01:17:06,898 --> 01:17:08,347
take a little look around town,

1519
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,349
see that he liked what we had,

1520
01:17:10,418 --> 01:17:11,913
and we would've been
up and out of here,

1521
01:17:11,937 --> 01:17:14,768
but instead, in one
second, the whole

1522
01:17:14,837 --> 01:17:15,952
town hates us and the next thing

1523
01:17:15,976 --> 01:17:17,460
we know we're being strung up.

1524
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:21,291
Yeah, well nice work
out there, pumpkin cakes!

1525
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,810
Pumpkin cakes?

1526
01:17:22,879 --> 01:17:24,294
What's your problem
all of a sudden?

1527
01:17:24,363 --> 01:17:26,400
Oh let's see, what
seems to be my problem?

1528
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:27,712
Let's start with you personally

1529
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:30,887
arranging for us to
be hung out there!

1530
01:17:30,956 --> 01:17:32,475
I think you got
me confused with the

1531
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:34,063
little third point of the lover

1532
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:36,582
triangle that you got
yourself involved in.

1533
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,378
It was Sebastian that
had the gun, not me.

1534
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:41,449
Yeah, whatever.

1535
01:17:41,518 --> 01:17:43,693
You know, come to think of it,

1536
01:17:43,762 --> 01:17:45,868
you weren't really much
help up there, were you?

1537
01:17:45,937 --> 01:17:47,628
With all your little sobbing.

1538
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:50,113
Okay, and you and
your bizarre mash-up of

1539
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:53,703
speeches really got the
job done there, didn't it?

1540
01:17:53,772 --> 01:17:55,153
Yeah, which is a
lot more than what

1541
01:17:55,222 --> 01:17:58,328
you did with all
your little crying.

1542
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,227
Knock it off, you whiner.

1543
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:01,815
Why don't you relax?

1544
01:18:01,884 --> 01:18:03,506
You know, now you're gonna have

1545
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:05,301
all the time in
the world to pursue

1546
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:08,614
your little relationship
with Rosa, right?

1547
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,720
Because now Christine is a widow

1548
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:13,240
and the kids, they
don't have a father.

1549
01:18:13,309 --> 01:18:15,725
But no no no no, you
just worry about your

1550
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:18,866
little relationship with
your girlfriend, mkay?

1551
01:18:18,935 --> 01:18:21,455
Okay, and whose
fault is all of this?

1552
01:18:21,524 --> 01:18:22,764
I mean you do realize that this

1553
01:18:22,801 --> 01:18:24,561
was your fault in
the first place

1554
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:27,047
that we're even here, don't you?

1555
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:28,565
Okay, okay, well why don't you

1556
01:18:28,634 --> 01:18:30,188
tell me a little
bit more about that

1557
01:18:30,257 --> 01:18:32,362
because this will be
really interesting

1558
01:18:32,431 --> 01:18:34,779
coming from the, can I
even remember it all,

1559
01:18:34,848 --> 01:18:37,816
let's see, the balloon
owning inventor

1560
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:39,715
with the Ivy League education.

1561
01:18:39,784 --> 01:18:41,064
You ever stop to
think that maybe

1562
01:18:41,095 --> 01:18:42,959
Rosa likes you a
little bit more for who

1563
01:18:43,028 --> 01:18:44,961
you pretend to be
rather than who you are?

1564
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,859
Do you wanna go there?

1565
01:18:45,928 --> 01:18:46,791
Sure!

1566
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,584
You really wanna go there?

1567
01:18:47,653 --> 01:18:48,827
Yeah, let's do it.

1568
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,080
Okay, let's see,
we met Jacuzzi down

1569
01:18:50,104 --> 01:18:51,150
at the river, why
were we at the river?

1570
01:18:51,174 --> 01:18:52,454
We were at the river because you

1571
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,212
were whining and
moaning and complaining

1572
01:18:54,281 --> 01:18:57,491
about getting fired
from your stupid job.

1573
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,779
And rather than standing up for

1574
01:18:58,803 --> 01:19:02,565
yourself, you did
what you always do!

1575
01:19:02,634 --> 01:19:04,601
You took it lying down!

1576
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:08,778
"Oh boo hoo, I got fired, time
to eat government cheese."

1577
01:19:10,021 --> 01:19:10,780
Yeah, well I...

1578
01:19:10,849 --> 01:19:13,058
This is a debacle?

1579
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:15,405
You're the debacle.

1580
01:19:15,474 --> 01:19:18,167
You don't have anyone
to blame but yourself.

1581
01:19:18,236 --> 01:19:20,514
You know, I tried standing up to

1582
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,792
him this time, and
what did it get me?

1583
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:25,036
It got me stuck in
this little time warp,

1584
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:27,832
wearing this stupid
clothes, with somebody with

1585
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:31,836
the emotional intelligence
of a 12 year old boy!

1586
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,909
You take that back right now.

1587
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:37,324
Okay.

1588
01:19:37,393 --> 01:19:38,877
I'm sorry.

1589
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:41,707
These clothes
aren't that stupid.

1590
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,470
Larry!

1591
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:48,266
Larry, come back!

1592
01:19:48,335 --> 01:19:49,646
(door slams)

1593
01:19:49,715 --> 01:19:51,338
I didn't mean it.

1594
01:19:51,407 --> 01:19:54,444
(gentle piano music)

1595
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:04,523
So I think I'm
gonna stick around

1596
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:07,009
a little while longer after all.

1597
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:09,183
Oh that would be terrific!

1598
01:20:09,252 --> 01:20:13,463
But I thought you had to
get back home with Vaughn.

1599
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:15,741
Vaughn and I are
parting company.

1600
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,504
He's going his way and,
well, I'm going mine.

1601
01:20:27,581 --> 01:20:29,410
It was a pleasure
to see Roger again.

1602
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:32,137
I wish it were under
different circumstances.

1603
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:33,932
He said we had a
nice little town here.

1604
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:35,554
But it came down to
the unwillingness

1605
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:36,903
of the railroad to work with any

1606
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:39,524
kind of problem that
Malachi might pose.

1607
01:20:39,593 --> 01:20:42,561
I wish it would've worked out.

1608
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,115
He's coming, he's coming!

1609
01:20:44,184 --> 01:20:45,461
Malachi is coming!

1610
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,290
He's coming from the south!

1611
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,260
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1612
01:20:56,506 --> 01:21:00,096
He's come back to
finish us off for sure!

1613
01:21:00,165 --> 01:21:01,857
(Sebastian) Every
many for himself!

1614
01:21:01,926 --> 01:21:05,964
Run for the hills, hide the
women, hide the children!

1615
01:21:18,183 --> 01:21:23,050
Where are the fine citizens
of Pumpkinville this morning?

1616
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:24,119
Hello?

1617
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:27,123
Anybody here?

1618
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:30,471
That's a shame.

1619
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:34,165
'Cause I'm here to
thwart your town!

1620
01:21:34,234 --> 01:21:36,650
Anybody wanna try to stop me?

1621
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:43,346
(military marching drums)

1622
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:55,393
What's this?

1623
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,360
A challenger?

1624
01:22:00,225 --> 01:22:04,264
Run along now, boy, before
you get yourself shot.

1625
01:22:05,886 --> 01:22:07,405
Does a newspaper
man really wanna get

1626
01:22:07,474 --> 01:22:11,167
hurt over something as
pathetic as this town?

1627
01:22:13,998 --> 01:22:17,242
Well I guess the
answer to that is yes.

1628
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:20,936
Let us begin.

1629
01:22:26,562 --> 01:22:29,185
Ah, two for the price
of one, terrific.

1630
01:22:29,254 --> 01:22:32,982
Which one of you would
like to be shot first?

1631
01:22:35,847 --> 01:22:38,436
Well I guess that would be you.

1632
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,715
(gunshot)

1633
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:48,756
That was cool.

1634
01:22:51,242 --> 01:22:52,898
(gunshots)

1635
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:54,210
Yeah!

1636
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:55,279
Woohoo!

1637
01:22:56,212 --> 01:22:57,212
Yeah!

1638
01:22:58,732 --> 01:22:59,732
Yeah!

1639
01:23:03,254 --> 01:23:04,634
Larry?

1640
01:23:04,703 --> 01:23:05,808
Yeah Vaughn?

1641
01:23:07,051 --> 01:23:08,742
(Vaughn) You just
used all your bullets.

1642
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:12,056
I don't think Malachi knows.

1643
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:15,093
Pretty sure he
knows how to count.

1644
01:23:20,823 --> 01:23:22,859
This isn't your fight, Reverend.

1645
01:23:22,928 --> 01:23:24,482
This is my fight.

1646
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:29,694
What about all that turn
the other cheek stuff?

1647
01:23:29,763 --> 01:23:33,905
As Moses commanded the
pharaoh, let my people go.

1648
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:43,535
(dramatic orchestral music)

1649
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:58,309
Hey now.

1650
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:00,828
There's no need for bloodshed.

1651
01:24:00,897 --> 01:24:04,970
I respect you fine folks,
I have no quarrel with you.

1652
01:24:05,799 --> 01:24:07,732
My quarrel is with him.

1653
01:24:09,596 --> 01:24:11,701
I'm not leaving you, Vaughn.

1654
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:13,772
I got this one, Larry.

1655
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,282
(country rock music)

1656
01:24:48,393 --> 01:24:50,292
It's just you and me.

1657
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,367
(gunshots)

1658
01:25:11,244 --> 01:25:12,244
Don't shoot.

1659
01:25:13,211 --> 01:25:14,557
I didn't mean any harm.

1660
01:25:14,626 --> 01:25:16,732
Here's what you're
gonna do, Malachi.

1661
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:18,458
You're gonna get
up off that ground

1662
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:19,676
and you're gonna go back to your

1663
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,841
pathetic, meaningless,
worthless life.

1664
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:26,050
Or else...

1665
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:29,538
Or else what, Sebastian?

1666
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:33,335
First of all, you're gonna hit

1667
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:35,337
him in the head really hard.

1668
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:36,659
Then you're gonna
embarrass him in front

1669
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:38,236
of everybody and
make him look like

1670
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:41,929
he's a pretend lawman
and hurt his feelings.

1671
01:25:44,518 --> 01:25:45,761
Get up!

1672
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:47,452
Get outta here!

1673
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:50,006
Go on, get up, get outta here!

1674
01:25:55,219 --> 01:25:56,219
He's gone!

1675
01:25:57,635 --> 01:25:59,119
He is gone!

1676
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:03,330
(cheering)
(upbeat western music)

1677
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:28,321
(music distorts)

1678
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:46,270
I smell bacon.

1679
01:26:47,892 --> 01:26:48,996
I love bacon.

1680
01:26:51,482 --> 01:26:53,346
Daddy, daddy, rocket!

1681
01:26:54,864 --> 01:26:57,626
Where's the cheering
crowd to Pumpkinville?

1682
01:26:57,695 --> 01:26:59,490
Is this real?

1683
01:26:59,559 --> 01:27:00,732
We're back?

1684
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:02,700
(laughing)

1685
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:03,769
Yes!

1686
01:27:05,703 --> 01:27:08,430
I am so sorry I was gone.

1687
01:27:08,499 --> 01:27:09,776
But now I'm back and things are

1688
01:27:09,845 --> 01:27:11,709
gonna be different, I promise.

1689
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:15,126
You're back from
sleeping on the couch.

1690
01:27:16,369 --> 01:27:18,543
Yeah, yeah, from the
night on the couch.

1691
01:27:18,612 --> 01:27:20,304
You want some
breakfast too, Larry?

1692
01:27:20,373 --> 01:27:21,373
Okay.

1693
01:27:22,582 --> 01:27:24,042
Can you get one of the chairs
from the party last night?

1694
01:27:24,066 --> 01:27:24,929
They're alongside the house.

1695
01:27:24,998 --> 01:27:25,998
Okay.

1696
01:27:29,105 --> 01:27:30,866
What in the world has happened?

1697
01:27:30,935 --> 01:27:32,108
I have no idea.

1698
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:34,559
A time warp, a dream?

1699
01:27:34,628 --> 01:27:36,216
(Larry) Like a mirage?

1700
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:38,425
I mean it can't be!

1701
01:27:38,494 --> 01:27:39,875
We did it.

1702
01:27:39,944 --> 01:27:42,429
I tell you, that Keezheekoni,
he's a man of his word.

1703
01:27:42,498 --> 01:27:46,053
He said heal the town
and boom, we're back.

1704
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:50,368
(Roland) There he is.

1705
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:51,473
Yikes.

1706
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:52,957
Nice bed head, sport.

1707
01:27:53,026 --> 01:27:54,476
Listen, I'm gonna need you to

1708
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,443
get that fence
outta here by noon.

1709
01:27:56,512 --> 01:27:58,100
We're getting the pool today.

1710
01:27:58,169 --> 01:27:59,826
Why don't you back off, Roland?

1711
01:27:59,895 --> 01:28:02,104
I got this, Larry.

1712
01:28:02,173 --> 01:28:04,037
I'm not gonna pull up my fence

1713
01:28:04,106 --> 01:28:06,729
so you can put in your pool.

1714
01:28:06,798 --> 01:28:08,179
You wanna put a pool up?

1715
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:10,595
Put it on your ground.

1716
01:28:10,664 --> 01:28:12,287
Oh my goodness.

1717
01:28:12,356 --> 01:28:14,806
I guess you really do
wanna get body slammed.

1718
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:18,016
This isn't the third
grade anymore, Roland.

1719
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:20,467
I want you to get
out of my yard.

1720
01:28:20,536 --> 01:28:22,435
I'm serious, leave now.

1721
01:28:24,022 --> 01:28:25,300
Cut him down.

1722
01:28:26,749 --> 01:28:29,373
Are you sure you wanna rumble?

1723
01:28:31,582 --> 01:28:33,722
Let my people go.

1724
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:36,863
(country rock music)

1725
01:28:52,672 --> 01:28:56,814
Come back again, there'll be
more where that came from.

1726
01:29:09,274 --> 01:29:10,931
Can I get you a
water while you wait?

1727
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,450
Water would be great.

1728
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:13,519
Thank you.

1729
01:29:20,044 --> 01:29:21,252
What up, cuz?

1730
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:22,805
A little of this,
a little of that.

1731
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:24,220
So how was your vacation?

1732
01:29:24,289 --> 01:29:26,050
It was perfect.

1733
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:27,569
So where'd you guys go again?

1734
01:29:27,638 --> 01:29:30,779
Seven night western
Caribbean cruise.

1735
01:29:30,848 --> 01:29:31,848
You?

1736
01:29:31,883 --> 01:29:33,057
On a cruise?

1737
01:29:33,126 --> 01:29:36,405
(laughs) That's awesome!

1738
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:40,305
Dude, we're dying down
at the shop without you.

1739
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,343
Mr. Carter says he
wants you back big time.

1740
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:45,794
Yeah, he's left me
a couple voicemail.

1741
01:29:45,863 --> 01:29:47,243
You coming back?

1742
01:29:47,312 --> 01:29:48,312
Well...

1743
01:29:49,453 --> 01:29:50,453
No.

1744
01:29:51,524 --> 01:29:52,524
I'm not.

1745
01:29:56,874 --> 01:29:59,773
Vaughn's Collision Center.

1746
01:29:59,842 --> 01:30:01,257
And I'm in need of a new service

1747
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:04,053
manager, so if you know anybody.

1748
01:30:04,122 --> 01:30:06,262
What's going on with you?

1749
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:09,024
Call it the
Pumpkinville experience.

1750
01:30:09,093 --> 01:30:11,198
Man, I have done over
100 searches online

1751
01:30:11,267 --> 01:30:13,787
and can't find anything
about that place.

1752
01:30:13,856 --> 01:30:15,271
Some things can't be explained,

1753
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:18,378
I just say thank
God it happened.

1754
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:21,139
Talk about an eye
opening experience.

1755
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:25,350
I mean for one thing, I am
done living some pretend life.

1756
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,770
It's time for me to open
up and try something new.

1757
01:30:30,839 --> 01:30:31,736
Here you go.

1758
01:30:31,805 --> 01:30:33,117
Thank you.

1759
01:30:33,186 --> 01:30:34,843
What can I get for you to drink?

1760
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:37,639
I think I'll just take a water.

1761
01:30:43,955 --> 01:30:46,510
I'll be back with your water.

1762
01:30:52,343 --> 01:30:53,586
Pumpkinville.
