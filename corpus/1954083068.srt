Mild headache. I'll find it with Jerry at 08:20.

12
00:01:48,616 --> 00:01:51,816

00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:08,617
He wants me to make amends. -So you let him do it again?

I call me </ i> No! Jolene!

19
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,019
Forget it! Forget all men like him. You deserve more.

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,020
Are not you late for work?

21
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:22,021

22
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:27,718

Of course!

25
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:24,825
There was nothing I could do. He was ... -The problem with the car?

26
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:28,626
This time, not a car, but ... -Lock the car?

27
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,627

31
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,327
Žvakaæa! Perfect.

32
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:58,328

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,125
Hi! Did you decided to order?

34
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:26,922
Maybe it's in the bag. -Smart. Yes.

35
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:30,923

Currently looking at a fresh candles. It smells good.

43
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,727

00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:21,429

50
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,130
I heard a ringing cell phone, but I did not get back to you.

51
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:50,427

Good.

58
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:33,801
Tulips. Flowers called tulips.

59
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:38,898
All right. Bye.

60
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,096
Good morning, Ardis. -G. Gus, just thinking will you finally ...

I was behind, he wants to talk to you. -I like your haircut.

64
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:09,399
Thanks Gus, but I'm going to cut until the afternoon.

65
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,400
I meant to tell you is so great, so that do not change too much.

66
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:24,397
Hey, Sam. Are you okay?

67
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:29,094
No, I do miss kamenèiæ. Blue diamond. Have you seen him?

68
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:32,295
I think you've polished it some day.

69
00:07:32,396 --> 00:07:35,696
Gus, you had it last.

70
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:40,097
Never mind, we'll find him. Mrs. Bing wants her brooch as soon as possible.

71
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:43,198
Can you handle it? -Mrs. Bing?

72
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,599
A lady who used too much perfume.

73
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,500
I do not know. Do not worry, you will know when namirišeš.

74
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,201
Important - fix brooch Mrs. Bing.

75
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:58,502
I would not worry about GDI Bing, but a diamond. I need it.

76
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:01,503
I need you.

77
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:08,000
Search, blue diamond.

78
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:11,801

00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,602
stupid car blocked ...

80
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:17,603
If we at least one thing went right.

81
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:22,504
All right. How? -Jolene, I can not borrow from you again!

82
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,505
Let me at least help restore the car back.

83
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,006
How much?

84
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:34,141
Old sentence, new sentence, remove the padlock with rubber ...

85
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:37,642
Around $ 175. Nearly 200!

86
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:43,940
Here you go. -I'll come back.

87
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,041
I know.

88
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:49,542
How's it going with that legacy?

89
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:54,143
Impossible mission. I wonder if all that lost the case.

90
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:58,344
I live in a different way.

91
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:02,845
Starting from today! I'll take care of you financial situation,

92
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:06,946
interrupted with Roger! You were right! Who left the girl on her birthday?

93
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,047
That's it!

94
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,348
For a change, the next time Find NEKON decent and precious.

95
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,549
He's out there somewhere. -Jolene, nobody knows

96
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,850
you're a good person. Because we are roommates.

97
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:22,151
Because you are totally mistaken.

98
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,448
Hey, Gus!

99
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,749
Bye. I'm Bernadette, this is Max.

100
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,550
We live upstairs. Nice to meet you.

101
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:43,851
Already us know. -Good.

102
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:46,452
Let Gus alone.

103
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,853
Can we bring back those $ 5 you owe me?

104
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:53,850
You do not owe him anything! How many times do you have to say?

105
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:57,451
Stop talking to Gus owes you money! I He does not remember </ i>

106
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:00,452

00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:03,453
Bernadette and Max!

108
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:19,050
Great! Thank you! -Until next time, Molly.

109
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:25,747
My dear, where are you?

110
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,344
Venus.

111
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,445
If you do not use social networks, why not use it?

112
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:51,846
Where are your sites, blogs? Do you know how to present

113
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:55,147
Twitter, Yelp, conduct a Google? The possibilities are endless

114
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:58,948
and the point is that if you do not know today how to keep your small business

115
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,549
then do not open.

116
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,750
I want to make a plan. It is your task to Monday.

117
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,251
Tell me your plan. You understand?

118
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,852
If you want an example, you can download it from the website.

119
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:17,453
I now look at some fresh flowers. It smells good. </ I>

120
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,454
I wonder what kind </ i>

121
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:24,655
I note that you are definitely back in Addie Mae's. </ i>

122
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:31,057
Hey, you do not know me and believe me, I'd never do anything like that. </ i>

123
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:34,658
I just wanted to thank you for noticing the flowers. </ i>

124
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,159

127
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,462
I with Jerry talks focused on Molly </ i>

128
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,063
I do not want to discourage. Cvjeæarnica is a good idea

129
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:00,964
vision but are not well targeted. Think about the competition in the city.

130
00:12:00,965 --> 00:12:05,265
I do not want to throw in something from just anything you will not be able to get away.

131
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:08,266
What do you know about your intention? Why cvjeæarnica?

132
00:12:08,467 --> 00:12:11,267
Sometimes children make a wish staring at the stars.

133
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,968
I do it trgajuæi petals.

134
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:16,469
Arranging bouquets someone can brighten your day.

135
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,069
I know that it is not ambitious.

136
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,370
But you is ambitious. Therefore honor it and organize it.

137
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:58,464
Hi! Good morning!

138
00:12:58,665 --> 00:13:01,465
Glad to see you!

139
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:05,762
You're late minute!

140
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:29,061
Are you okay? Wanna talk about it?

141
00:13:29,862 --> 00:13:31,559
I know, I'm calling you every morning </ i>

142
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,460
You want me to come to you? I do not. There's no need. </ I>

143
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:41,361
Lucy, this is why I moved from California to New Orleans?

144
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:45,362
Yes, in order to be in a familiar environment. And that I can be with you

145
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:49,063
whenever you need me. And Jerry.

146
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:53,664
Thank you for helping me to handle this all in. ..

147
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:59,161
Helping me. I-What are sisters for? </ i>

148
00:13:59,262 --> 00:14:02,162
Or I Venus </ i>

149
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:06,863
I wish you a nice day, a nice life. My name is Molly. </ I>

150
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:11,664
Remember Suzy Watkins from the 5th Grades? She gave you a gift for Valentine's Day.

151
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,865
What does that have to do with .. Or Lily Gazinski, 8th Grades?

152
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:17,966
She invited you to a little graduation. I had the chance!

153
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,499
Until you have moved to California. 12 years I've watched

154
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,968
how these women fall into your lap. And I? I've always watched TV with popcorn

155
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,469
and my sister. And then I even had a flat stomach.

156
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,970
Even you and Brenda liked more than me.

157
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:37,271
Who is Molly? Yes, Molly.

158
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:41,372
I'd say that's a good girl, probably not very much.

159
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:45,473
Sensitive, generous, with a strange sense of curiosity.

160
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:48,874
What luðakinja leaves messages to strangers? How do you it seems?

161
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,175
I love it. Just you.

162
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:55,176
Waiting for my clients and the case that I get.

163
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:00,077
Come on now! Go! Okay, I'm going.

164
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,878
Yes, go now.

165
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,375
Sorry! -Oh my God!

166
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,376
Sorry, I did not mean to scare you.

167
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,377
Hi, I did not know that you're doing here.

168
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,178
I am. Do you remember me?

169
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,379
You Gus, do not you? I've been waiting for you.

170
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,280
Sorry if I scared the other day. It was one of those days.

171
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:35,381
In fact, today I was such a day. I sold it.

172
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,082
Pretty expensive. I got it as a gift.

173
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:42,883
I'm broke so I will accept half of its value.

174
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:47,984
I'm sorry, but today I can not help it. Then tomorrow? You tell.

175
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:52,985
No, not really.

176
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:57,486
Why? Because it is false.

177
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:01,287
Impossible! -Come, I'll show you.

178
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:05,288
Let's see. Yes, right there.

179
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,889
Original. Yours.

180
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,790
First, you can feel by touch.

181
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:15,591
Then you can feel the difference in weight.

182
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:22,793
And last, the original label that unfortunately out of your way.

183
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:25,744
Of course! -I'm sorry. Are you okay?

184
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:28,745
Junk lying fool!

185
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:33,746
What was it? I'm sorry, I did not ...

186
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:37,747
I Forever, Roger. </ i> It's okay.

187
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:42,448
I'm so sorry. I Forever </ i> is not really that long.

188
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:47,349
Thank you looked at him. You've got a nice ring with rubies.

189
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,950
This? -Yes. can you see it?

190
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:56,451
Half kamenèiæa missing. -Yes.

191
00:16:56,752 --> 00:17:00,852
Nevertheless it is very nice. And there are many kamenèiæa in it.

192
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,753
It belonged to my aunt.

193
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,954
She has good taste.

194
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,655
Definitely.

195
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:13,556
It is a Victorian ring, rarely can find them.

196
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:20,253
$ 50.

197
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:25,650
I can not pay that much. Value-at least 50

198
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:30,051
I think ... I need money.

199
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,948
Here you go.

200
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,645
$ 200? I told 50 -Worth more than 50

201
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,042
No way you can pay less.

202
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:52,339
I've lived here three years already. I changed two cars,

203
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:56,340
four apartments, three boy and met countless strangers

204
00:17:56,641 --> 00:18:00,541
and this is one of the most beautiful things that someone did for me.

205
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:04,242
Come on ... Thank you.

206
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:09,339
Sorry, what's your name? -Molly. My name is Molly.

207
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,340
Thank you again. -Yes. Molly, I wish you a nice day.

208
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,337
I Saèuvaj for Molly </ i>

209
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,634
What possesses? The jewelry?

210
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:49,935
I do not ... I do not know. He's nice. Just like you said.

211
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:53,936
Drag and bastard and, agreeable and dangerous ... How are you dear?

212
00:18:53,937 --> 00:18:55,937
I think I have a good assessment.

213
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:00,238
Molly! What? I'm just nice to kind boyfriend.

214
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,339
What's wrong with that? -Take the floral pattern.

215
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,940
In it, you look desperately.

216
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:23,407
Hi, Sam.

217
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:27,608
I was looking for, but I think I've never seen a blue diamond.

218
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,309
Gus, we need to find him.

219
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,410
This just came. Someone pushed under the door.

220
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,107
I Dear Gus, thank you for noticing the flowers. You've made my day. Molly. </ I>

221
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,804
I sent you a wilted flower? I think that Molly calls out.

222
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,501
Literally and stalking. Send her a message or a call.

223
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:07,027
Neither is know her.

224
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:09,515
She left a message on that your recorder,

225
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:12,003
send a postcard, you would still need to know?

226
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,570
What else do I need to know?

227
00:20:13,605 --> 00:20:17,905
You had an aneurysm, lost pamæenje, you have suffered a lot.

228
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:19,606
Be thankful you're still alive.

229
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:24,507
And to remember the important things before the nervous breakdown. Like me.

230
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:27,508
Gus, you're not living. We are all experienced trauma.

231
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,709
I am a divorced woman with whom I thought I spend my life.

232
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,410
I know it's not the same, but the call went out. What bad could happen?

233
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:38,011
Wait ... You and Brenda're divorced?

234
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:41,712
Yes! Will you go over? You're ruining my lunch.

235
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,709
Hi Molly, Gus here.

236
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,310

242
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,047
Perhaps the Cafe Amelie.

243
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:35,548
They have delicious food.

244
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:40,449
I If it fits in 19:30 </ i> Meet me there.

245
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,250
To reiterate, here Gus Gillenwater.

246
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,651
Okay, bye.

I Make Payment salaries. And at 19:30 you have a date with Molly Cafe Amelie. </ I>

248
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,945
I Gus? Gus </ i> Hi, stay there.

249
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:24,846
Hello? -Gus?

250
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:29,347
Is that you? Bernadette.

251
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,548
My son Max and I live upstairs.

252
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:38,245
Thank God! That's better.

253
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:43,146
Sorry, I have problems with memory.

254
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:46,847
If you again, I asked for the name ... Good going, Gus.

255
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,548
Do you need something?

256
00:22:49,849 --> 00:22:53,649
No, I think not. -Good. Good night.

257
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,350
Good night. -Max? Hi, what are you doing?

258
00:23:25,746 --> 00:23:28,446
Molly?

259
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:33,743
Where's Molly? -In the back.

260
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:37,344
Molly!

261
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:40,345
Molly! Yeah? What are you doing?

262
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:44,346
I finished. Check the schedule. I work until 19:00. I have a meeting.

263
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:48,147
Oh, I'm sorry. Compound?

264
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:52,148
Hard to believe, but yes. -Is it a good boy?

265
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:56,249
I think so. You're a pretty girl, Molly.

266
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,750
And dear. Irresponsible, but nice.

267
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:03,551
're Worth. Someday ...

268
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,152
Blurs my mirror. -You look good.

269
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:10,153
Thank you.

270
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,297
I Hi, Jerry. </ i> Is' ugly?

271
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:36,398
Do not hang up, just say yes or no.

272
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:40,495
I Gus, where are you? </ i>

273
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:43,296
I at home. </ i> Is you serious?

274
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:46,297
I knew it! I Why are you home? </ i> That's why I live here.

275
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:49,250
Do not you know what tonight? Nothing special?

276
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:53,599
Are you dressed? I want you dressed for the compound when I come. I'm coming.

277
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,096
More bread? I do not need.

278
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,497
Thank you.

279
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,798
Did you intentionally blew? Say you are not. Jerry, I did not know!

280
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,199
It is no longer an excuse! It's not an excuse, but a fact.

281
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,700
This is unacceptable, why bother at all?

282
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:16,701
Because you're my best friend since I was six.

283
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:20,402
That's it. I'm glad you do not have to write every morning.

284
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:55,201
Do not call me anymore! Do not send me messages, e-mails or any signals!

285
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,302
I do not want to talk with a man who will only disappoint me!

286
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:00,603
Goodbye!

287
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:03,604
What if I'm better off?

288
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:07,105
Maybe my brain is just protecting. Or maybe you're just a coward.

289
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,906
Come in, look for it, eat something, listen to it ...

290
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:13,907
Maybe the kiss. Jerry!

291
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:17,308
If something goes wrong, you will not be anyway to remember in the morning.

292
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,009
A well told.

293
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,406
Flowers? Yes! What do you have?

294
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:30,107
Yes, $ 10. Thank you.

295
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,104
That's it? -Address the envelope.

296
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,845
Are you sure about this? -You look as if you regret,

297
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:06,046
Say you're sorry, give her a rose and begged for a second chance.

298
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:08,647
The fourth floor, apartment 417

299
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,648
Why do you care about this? -Let at least one of us has a love life.

300
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:16,049
What happened to Brenda? -Get out!

301
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,746
I open it </ i>

302
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:27,847
You have forgotten your keys?

303
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,244
I just got back. How was it ...

304
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:37,145
Hi!

305
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:41,046
This is for you! Sorry!

306
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:45,447
Probably they need water. I'll put them in water.

307
00:27:45,648 --> 00:27:48,848
Here's the link. I'll ask and receive. </ i>

308
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:51,949
Otherwise, I'm more organized. I'm really sorry.

309
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,550
I feel terrible, Molly. Okay, what is this?

310
00:27:56,451 --> 00:28:00,251
What? -This. Flowers. I'm Molly.

311
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:04,648
I know! I know.

312
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,249
I know. Just practicing.

313
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,750
For what? -For Molly.

314
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,751
I'm here.

315
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,748
This is for you! Roses, sunflowers not.

316
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:31,549
Although they are beautiful.

317
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,550
I did not ... You probably think ...

318
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:38,351
I do not really know what you mean, just ...

319
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:45,153
I want to accept these flowers as a sign of sincere repentance.

320
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:48,354
Or, as a sign of gratitude.

321
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,255
I'm really sorry, Molly, especially because I think you're so ...

322
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:09,956
Brilliant.

323
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:20,553
Wow! He just needs to keep.

324
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:30,850
Molly ...

325
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:34,851
Molly, do not you dare!

326
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:38,452
Try it now.

327
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:44,049
How'd you do that?

328
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,050
I'm good at mechanical things.

329
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,551
It would really be good.

330
00:29:52,652 --> 00:29:56,748
I wanted to thank you for making me stop.

331
00:29:56,949 --> 00:29:59,749
For a long time I did not even skim out.

332
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,350
With my job and everything else ...

333
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,151
Of course, I'm busy.

334
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,710
Trade you doing well? -Shop?

335
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:13,111
Your jewelry store where doing.

336
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:17,112
Where are we ... -No.

337
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:20,913
I mean, I work there, but not my jewelery.

338
00:30:21,014 --> 00:30:24,214
The owner was a neighbor of my parents, before they died.

339
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:27,215
I've known them since childhood.

340
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:34,712
You want to go somewhere else? Sure.

341
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:40,813
Yes, I am studying at the same time, the waiter, can not wait something better.

342
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:44,214
I moved here three years ago from the northeast.

343
00:30:44,215 --> 00:30:47,615
Thank you. -These are very tasty. Is not it?

344
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:51,616
Why did you move here?

345
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:55,317
To go fascinated. To be what I want.

346
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:59,318
And what would you be? Really?

347
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:06,920
I imagine a girl who is constantly worried that I would turn on her car,

348
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,321
which does not have hardly make ends meet,

349
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,922
which does not have to live in an apartment tuðem, which can achieve something.

350
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,896
I want to be.

351
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,823
Is jewelry what you really want to know?

352
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:22,625
In fact, cosmology. -Hair?

353
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:26,626
No, although it's close.

354
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:31,127
Stars. Universe. I Cosmos </ i> - cosmology.

355
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:34,228
Actually, come with me.

356
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,829
A little to the left.

357
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:42,930
See how the harmonized? You mean like a horoscope?

358
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,231
Wrenched open a little. Sometimes squint you can see the stars ...

359
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:50,332
Do you see now? That's right there. See?

360
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,733
It is ... Teapot!

361
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:57,434
No, it's shopping carts. I can see, there are wheels

362
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:01,835
and that part there, it's pram! Am I right?

363
00:32:02,236 --> 00:32:08,467
No, but nice try. Expertly run, it's Orion.

364
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:13,568
Right ascension to 5 pm, the deviation at 5 degrees ...

365
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,869
It's very scientific.

366
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,170
Where did you get that idea?

367
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,171
Or may be pram! Looks just like them!

368
00:32:24,372 --> 00:32:27,472
And not just ... Making that up.

369
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:31,873
If you're curious about the universe, how is it that you do in a jewelry store?

370
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:35,074
Good question!

371
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:39,075
I worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.

372
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:43,076
Before that, the OUR, I graduated at Caltech.

373
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:47,077
So why do not you do it?

374
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,278
I ...

375
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,979
Science is all around us, right?

376
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,680
For example, diamonds. When you look at them,

377
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,931
seems to have its own galaxy.

378
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:04,982
The way the light penetrates from them and reflects the ...

379
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,383
It can be wonderful. Sounds that stupid? I have such a feeling.

380
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:10,984
Not when you're talking about.

381
00:33:10,985 --> 00:33:13,185
Look! See?

382
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:16,486
A shooting star! Yes! Right.

383
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:20,387
Technically, it was a meteor. But yes, it was a shooting star. Unbelievable.

384
00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:23,388
How a bunch of stardust looks so

385
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:26,489
beautifully while burning the Earth's atmosphere.

386
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,190
Yes.

387
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:34,291
I gotta get back. Tomorrow I have a lot of obligations.

388
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:37,792
I. ..

389
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:41,593
On Sunday early raise.

390
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:47,194
Yes, I'm free on Sunday afternoon.

391
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:51,795
Will you give me a call on a date or not?

392
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:56,496
You mean the real date? -Yes. You show up on time,

393
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:59,797
do something normal, eating, talking ...

394
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:03,098
Can.

395
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,699
Then invite me on a date?

396
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,000
Sunday.

397
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,401
And this time I can remember, Molly. I promise.

398
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,902
All right.

399
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,299
Molly Brandford.

400
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,300
Tonight you have a date with Molly Brandford.

401
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,701
It was great.

402
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:35,198
Try to find a way to keep it.

403
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,199
I Molly Brandford. </ i>

404
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,600
Tonight I've had a date with Molly Brandford. </ i>

405
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:56,001
I was great. Try to find a way to keep it. </ I>

406
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,500
Do I pay you to write? The break-I.

407
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,299
I Cvjeæarnica Molly petals </ i>

408
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,097
It's my job at the university.

409
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:18,098
My plan. I Molly's lovely petals. </ i>

410
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:22,199
Good. One day I'll work for you, but right now you're doing for me.

411
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,200
Break's over. Serve customers to third in the table.

412
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:33,997
I Do, I study at the same time and wait tables, </ i>

413
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,598
I can not wait a better opportunity. I moved before ... </ i> Who is it?

414
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,995
Girl.

415
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,996
A friend ...

416
00:35:47,097 --> 00:35:51,997
With that tomorrow I have a date because we obviously went on a date last night

417
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,398
and it was very nice.

418
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,399
I. ..

419
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:03,100
I can not explain it, but I think I really like it.

420
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:09,807
Dressed because we have scheduled an appointment with a doctor.

421
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:16,008
You understand that your aneurysm destroyed hippocampus?

422
00:36:16,209 --> 00:36:21,409
Yes. My old memories before aneurysms are normal.

423
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,910
Sorry, you probably already ask for the hundredth time,

424
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,190
but what about my new memories?

425
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:31,012
Otherwise healthy brain using sleep assimilate short-term memory.

426
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:34,713
When you around. Sleep you lose short-term memory.

427
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:38,614
With so complicated neurons, it is difficult to say

428
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,815
where information is stored.

429
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:43,516
Headaches?

430
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:49,217
I noted two. Lucy we developed a good system.

431
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,218
Excellent. I'm glad you that the system works.

432
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,419
To negotiate a new term? I can not live like this.

433
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,016
I want my brain back. I need it.

434
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,817
It is our goal and Gus. We are testing a promising treatment

435
00:37:05,018 --> 00:37:07,918
and perhaps for a year ... I do not have a year!

436
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,419
Lucy has created this brilliant system and I am very grateful for that.

437
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:18,320
All of these procedures, which helped me to make my life work, but ...

438
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:23,121
I have no brief pamæenja not advance, and how could I?

439
00:37:23,192 --> 00:37:25,522
Every time I try to do something new,

440
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:29,323
can not be given to it. I need this, I need new stuff.

441
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:32,524
I need to bring me closer to people

442
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:35,925
and not to forget them every damn day!

443
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:41,722
Please ...

444
00:37:41,923 --> 00:37:45,423
If using my brain again to work.

445
00:37:47,624 --> 00:37:50,624
Gus, he can not.

446
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:54,525
Yet. We will not give up.

447
00:37:54,726 --> 00:37:57,322
Everything is possible.

448
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:00,723
Healed me!

449
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:03,424
Please!

450
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:13,121
Soon I will see you again. Are you sure you're okay?

451
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:17,122
Why would not I be? -Gus?

452
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,519
As for the new girls, if you're serious about it,

453
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,170
you have to tell her the truth. Otherwise it's not fair.

454
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:32,967
I love you. -Good.

455
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:36,419
You're gonna tell her? I hardly know her! As the name anyway? Molly?

456
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:38,419
Lucy is right. I decided.

457
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,120
To tell her that she can not remember the name of the day?

458
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:43,730
It's true, is not it?

459
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:46,971
And when her plan to admit? We put a little bit?

460
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:49,572
I'm gonna puke!

461
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:54,769
If you plan to tell her and hold her,

462
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,270
First is you have to win. Take the slip.

463
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,845
Skating?

464
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:03,371
Yes, skating. I took one girl and she was thrilled.

465
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,072
You cheated Brenda?

466
00:39:06,193 --> 00:39:10,073
Brenda has another guy. We're separated!

467
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:14,474
More than a year ago. More accurately, 14 months and 22 days, but who's counting?

468
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:17,175
I'm tired of the constant repetition.

469
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,606
But Brenda was great! I know!

470
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:25,207
Signing the papers for the divorce was my biggest mistake in my life!

471
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:29,308
Why do you think treime? Give me that your recorder.

472
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:33,309
I know the perfect place where you'll take her.

473
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,406
The rink I Moonlight Dome </ i> How did you think of this?

474
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:49,807
A friend had recommended it.

475
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:56,965
I'm not dressed appropriately, and I really can not ... Watch out!

476
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:01,966
He was amused. And we can so.

477
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,067
All right. Come on!

478
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,054
Maybe we should try something else.

479
00:40:13,355 --> 00:40:17,055
No, you're doing great. -Through!

480
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:21,706
Maybe we could get a bite.

481
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,807
It may, of course.

482
00:40:25,308 --> 00:40:30,204
Ladies and gentlemen, the last of the evening is only for couples.

483
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:34,105
Thus, only couples. Get away from the rink!

484
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:41,406
OK, a bit of nostalgia for you golupèiæe. Enjoy!

485
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,400
What do you think?

486
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,297
Yes, you're doing good. -Approx.

487
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:13,498
Forget it, I'm just bad at this.

488
00:41:13,699 --> 00:41:16,999
Molly, nobody cares. Look around you.

489
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,500
This is buffoonery.

490
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,201
Come closer. I promise you that I will not bite. Now the left.

491
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:27,502
Right, left, right. That's it.

492
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,103
Look, you catch the rhythm.

493
00:41:31,244 --> 00:41:34,204
The upcoming turn. -I got you.

494
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:39,755
How long kližeš?

495
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,756
I do not know. I always have.

496
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:46,557
I always? -Wait, painting.

497
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,654
See this turn! You did not turn around.

498
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:57,455
It was not bad!

499
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:14,752
Come on!

500
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,049
Excellent're doing. I'm fine.

501
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,346
Today was beautiful.

502
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:40,647
What would you do if you could choose?

503
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:44,648
I opened cvjeæarnicu.

504
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:47,649
You should not be.

505
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,950
Why would I laugh? -People are sometimes not that.

506
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:55,451
I suppose that sounds ridiculous. Irrelevant.

507
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:59,852
I do not sounds. Why is not already opened?

508
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:03,553
I'm waiting on some money.

509
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:07,154
My Aunt Ruth had no grandchildren

510
00:43:07,355 --> 00:43:11,355
so the property has left me and my daughter.

511
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:18,657
They should divide the money but my cousin is stalling. -Awful.

512
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,349
Waiting to solve it,

513
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,259
I odugovlaèila is a new beginning in my life.

514
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,060
I'm stuck, and I'm tired of waiting for something to happen.

515
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:33,661
I do not want to be afraid. Do you understand me?

516
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:36,662
Yes.

517
00:43:54,763 --> 00:43:57,659
What is it? I tell Molly ... </ i>

518
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,760
Nothing. Nonsense.

519
00:44:01,961 --> 00:44:06,461
But this is what I have done for you in the diner.

520
00:44:07,362 --> 00:44:10,762
The rear part I'm not the best made, but ... Elephant!

521
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:14,263
It's very nice, thank you. I've seen it izraðuješ.

522
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:18,264
Another hidden talent. What I do not know about you?

523
00:44:20,065 --> 00:44:23,065
I live here.

524
00:44:23,766 --> 00:44:27,966
What is your apartment? Balcony with a telescope.

525
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:32,767
Terror. I've never looked through a telescope.

526
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:37,264
It should.

527
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:41,265
I mean, one should try.

528
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,562
Yes.

529
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,659
I have to go, but I'll see it. -Good.

530
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,756
Wanna talk about it? No!

531
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:18,353
I want to. You were right.

532
00:45:18,554 --> 00:45:21,054
I'm furious at myself. Oh impossible.

533
00:45:21,295 --> 00:45:24,255
You really like it? Very.

534
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:28,056
I literally threw herself at him. And what he did?

535
00:45:29,657 --> 00:45:32,257
Maybe she married.

536
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:36,458
Do not do that tonight. I can not stand your cynicism.

537
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:40,359
Perhaps it is better to avoid, let the other pulls him.

538
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,800
42 years and no objection. Have you ever complained? I did not!

539
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:49,601
I, vièeš! We need to do this.

540
00:45:49,802 --> 00:45:52,802
Blue diamonds do not just disappear!

541
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:57,103
No, Addie Mae's, when they ...

542
00:45:57,304 --> 00:46:00,104
Great! Thank you, bye.

543
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:03,105
Hey, is everything okay?

544
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:06,106
Rehn insurance companies have is here, remember?

545
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:10,007
Glad to see you again, Gus. -Hi. What is going on?

546
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,608
Mr. Zed has a few questions about the blue diamond.

547
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,609
Where the blue diamond?

548
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,916
Iznenaðujeæe is.

549
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,117
I was not sure he ... I do not know how I should feel.

550
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,118
It's not just one mountain, the mountain already.

551
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:34,219
I do not understand. What is there to understand?

552
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,721
A man sends you flowers because you want to know that he likes you.

553
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,530
I hope you like tulips. Gus </ i>

554
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:47,631
This is it? Molly?

555
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:50,632
It's very beautiful.

556
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:54,433
Is it serious? I do not know.

557
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:57,734
That's why I called you to come. Listen to this.

558
00:46:57,885 --> 00:47:00,735
I ... can not wait to start my life. </ i>

559
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:04,236
I'm stuck, and I do not want to wait for something to happen. </ i>

560
00:47:04,237 --> 00:47:06,587
I do not want to be afraid of. </ i>

561
00:47:07,888 --> 00:47:10,684
I hate that I have to record our conversations but

562
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,085
it will be to remember what we have done and talked,

563
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:17,786
and I want to remember it. You guys should be to remember such things.

564
00:47:17,787 --> 00:47:23,288
Her favorite flowers, dresses on the first date, ordinary things.

565
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:27,189
But it's not fair to go out with her.

566
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:31,190
It is fair to decide if alone. Did you tell her?

567
00:47:31,591 --> 00:47:34,691
I wanted to. I intend to.

568
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:39,692
I think she really likes you.

569
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:43,193
What if I tell her and she did not mind at all?

570
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:46,794
Or if you tell her, and it's all over? -Here's your chance to find out.

571
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,895
That's it, is not it? Molly?

572
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,692
No, no! I'm not on the schedule. -Now it is.

573
00:47:57,893 --> 00:48:00,493
I'm not on the schedule! -Good luck!

574
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,154
I'm not in the notes! What should I do?

575
00:48:03,455 --> 00:48:06,455
Oh, God!

576
00:48:19,406 --> 00:48:22,352
Hi! Hi!

577
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:27,549
I'm coming! I'm coming!

578
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,650
Just that little poèistim.

579
00:48:30,801 --> 00:48:34,151
Molly, just a moment. -Gus?

580
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:36,952
Here I am.

581
00:48:37,153 --> 00:48:39,453
Almost.

582
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,750
Bye. -Hi. Sorry, I should have called ahead.

583
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,752
No, I've arrived at the right time. Really? You did not?

584
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:53,253
Flowers is wonderful, I just wanted to thank you.

585
00:48:53,954 --> 00:48:57,654
Also I have to ask you something. Sure, Come.

586
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,455
Would you like something to drink, a snack?

587
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:05,256
Or both? Oh whatever. Water?

588
00:49:05,357 --> 00:49:07,757
Yes, the water arrives.

589
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,054
It's very scientific.

590
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:22,455
Yeah, you know already ... Milk or sugar?

591
00:49:22,756 --> 00:49:25,956
What do you what do I need to bring? -Water.

592
00:49:26,057 --> 00:49:28,057
Exactly!

593
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,354
No way! No way?

594
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:38,355
No chance of that?

595
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:42,556
Yeah, no chance. It is Ur.

596
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:47,257
My sister bought them because I loved Star Wars.

597
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:52,954
I still love them. You carry in your purse Chewbacca?

598
00:49:53,155 --> 00:49:56,155
Scary! -The grapes are my best for you?

599
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:59,056
From orange. Excellent-have.

600
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:02,257
So ...

601
00:50:03,758 --> 00:50:07,054
Your water! Thank you.

602
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,055
I like your apartment. Thank you, nice and mine.

603
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:15,556
You told me you've got to ask you something? -Yes, I ...

604
00:50:16,657 --> 00:50:20,257
I wanted to ask you a couple of things ...

605
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,058
What is it?

606
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:26,259
This is the last important project on which I worked.

607
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,060
Remember the robot to explore Mars?

608
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:33,461
Spirit and Opportunity? -They run autiæi the remote?

609
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:36,762
They're made? Come on.

610
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,063
You created this new they were sent?

611
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:43,064
I'll get the coffee.

612
00:50:43,265 --> 00:50:47,365
It says so much. I wish I could read it all.

613
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,366
Take it with you. I've already read many times.

614
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:57,163
Currently working on this? -For what?

615
00:50:57,312 --> 00:51:04,465
Forbidden lines. New evidence on quintessencelike, Gustaf Gillenwater.

616
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:08,666
Gustaf? It sounds fancy, it's you? -I was once upon a time.

617
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,963
I was looking to throw something.

618
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:17,464
For thus?

619
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:21,965
Some trace. It soon as.

620
00:51:23,066 --> 00:51:27,262
You've done all these amazing things and obviously you liked it.

621
00:51:28,063 --> 00:51:31,763
how could you leave it all and move to New Orleans?

622
00:51:35,064 --> 00:51:38,160
People change, Molly.

623
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:43,661
Sometimes these things just happen in life that affect your ...

624
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:48,168
I Visible comets, 19:30 </ i>

625
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:52,469
Come to show you something! Where are we going?

626
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,170
Watch your head.

627
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:59,171
All right, look over there. What do you see?

628
00:51:59,372 --> 00:52:03,272
Is it a meteor? No, it's ... see here.

629
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:05,173
This is a comet.

630
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:10,874
Frozen gas, ice and dust, which extends the gravity of the Sun.

631
00:52:11,025 --> 00:52:14,075
However, it is interesting to ...

632
00:52:15,776 --> 00:52:20,176
What? -Talking about it as if you had it in you.

633
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:23,777
You had it in you. Actually, they all have.

634
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:26,578
It all starts.

635
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,979
All the elements in the universe come from stars.

636
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,881
Since it is made of. The calcium in our bones, the iron in the blood ...

637
00:52:37,082 --> 00:52:40,982
It all kicked off with the explosion.

638
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:46,283
No star would not see anything, either me or you ...

639
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:50,284
So, we are stardust.

640
00:52:50,285 --> 00:52:53,085
Yes. We are.

641
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:56,091
About 93%.

642
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,500
You know, sometimes it looks as if the comet lost.

643
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:15,897
And then return to orbit.

644
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:20,698
And when it counted, scientists realize that it is not at all lost.

645
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:24,699
Were found.

646
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,400
Stop for a moment.

647
00:53:27,551 --> 00:53:30,701
I wish I could freeze this moment

648
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,550
how he would never forget.

649
00:53:33,703 --> 00:53:36,203
Me too.

650
00:53:38,604 --> 00:53:42,500
Molly, I have something ... No!

651
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:46,501
What does not? -My lecture!

652
00:53:46,802 --> 00:53:50,502
I'm late! I'm done! My plan! Sorry, I'm stupid!

653
00:53:50,903 --> 00:53:53,703
I have an important presentation tonight! I gotta go!

654
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,200
Call me!

655
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:08,597
I'll call you! I will not forget!

656
00:54:08,748 --> 00:54:11,998
Hi! -I will not forget.

657
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,399
Call Molly. Do not forget! Do not forget!

658
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:21,100
Do not forget Molly Branford! Arrangements compound to tell her everything!

659
00:54:21,701 --> 00:54:24,301
At all costs!

660
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,399
You think it's a good idea to tell her now? -We will find out.

661
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:37,600
Not every woman ... Wait a minute. What do you think?

662
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,700
I wrote all about Molly in the folder I Read it to me every morning </ i>

663
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:45,401
so that I can remember. I want it! -Some things take time.

664
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,202
You can not just tell someone something so important.

665
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,703
They can, if she is the right girl for me. -You say you love her?

666
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,704
I say ... I've recorded,

667
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:58,405
And after each day spent with her, just as I feel.

668
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:02,106
So maybe ... Yes, I love it.

669
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:08,327
Do you ispovraæaju triplets,

670
00:55:08,328 --> 00:55:11,627
drunk girl fell while he goes to the bathroom ...

671
00:55:11,628 --> 00:55:13,304
That's what I call entertainment.

672
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:16,805
Maybe this job is not for me ... Saèekaj little.

673
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,956
I'll call you later.

674
00:55:20,857 --> 00:55:23,957
Hello? Hey Molly, Gus.

675
00:55:24,058 --> 00:55:27,333
Before you say anything, I'll explain

676
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:30,609
why I was acting so weird.

677
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,010
And that? It's hard to say over the phone.

678
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,211
I thought I'd take her somewhere special.

679
00:55:37,352 --> 00:55:40,912
Not Molly, Jolene said. Roommate of Molly.

680
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,813
We met when you have me confused with Molly.

681
00:55:46,414 --> 00:55:49,210
How many women hustling?

682
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,760
Call again and leave a message. I do not feel like it bother this.

683
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,907
I Hi, this is Jolene and Molly. Saèekajte signal. </ I>

684
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:11,704
Molly, Gus. I need to talk to you,

685
00:56:11,865 --> 00:56:15,165
explain some things. Meet me at sundown

686
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:18,166
zoo Otoban.

687
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:21,067
I got it? I'm waiting for you there. </ I>

688
00:56:21,168 --> 00:56:23,468
I deleted message. </ i>

689
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,469
Sorry, we close early. Expected storm.

690
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:45,070
Yes, I do ...

691
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,071
I was waiting for someone.

692
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:50,972
Maybe she forgot.

693
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:55,073
I wanted to show her elephants. ELEPHANTS and will be here tomorrow.

694
00:57:03,004 --> 00:57:05,970
You're lying, are not you? Tell me you're imagining!

695
00:57:06,071 --> 00:57:08,871
I know I should not, but it was for your own good.

696
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,272
I will not let you destroy some clown life.

697
00:57:12,373 --> 00:57:15,573
This Read it and tell me whether it's a clown.

698
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,704
Good. I do not know what his problem is.

699
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:21,445
Maybe you've got a problem. What?

700
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:24,746
The way you behave ... Would you prefer that I alone

701
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,547
and unhappy than to try to find a good one.

702
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,348
We both know that you bring a bad decision. I was protecting you.

703
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:34,849
This guy is different. He's nice and polite ...

704
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:38,150
And spontaneous. If you really think it's not good for me,

705
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,051
Why did you then say the message? You could pretend it was not there.

706
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:45,652
Because I've never seen something so desire.

707
00:57:47,653 --> 00:57:50,153
Accident.

708
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:54,154
Cooperate with me, old tank.

709
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,451
Thank you!

710
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:04,648
You're mad, do not blame you. I'm not angry.

711
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,649
She would go there, not my fault. Roommate wiped message.

712
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,550
Then my car would not start, then rain ... I'm so sorry.

713
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:16,601
It's okay. Can I get a towel?

714
00:58:16,802 --> 00:58:19,202
Thank you.

715
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:26,303
This is so sweet. You got our picture in the mirror.

716
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,204
I My girlfriend Molly. </ i>

717
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:35,105
Really it feel? -Yes.

718
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:39,802
Molly, I have a confession to make.

719
00:58:41,203 --> 00:58:44,599
You're married. What? -Jolene was right.

720
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:47,680
Do you have a girlfriend? Tell me the truth.

721
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,481
Please come here.

722
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,182
I do not have a girlfriend. I have no wife. I'm not married.

723
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:58,083
But I have a problem ...

724
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,184
With memory.

725
00:59:01,785 --> 00:59:04,185
I can not ...

726
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:10,282
That's your problem? That's your only problem?

727
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:14,283
Yes, but ... Oh please!

728
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:17,684
How am only things I forgot!

729
00:59:20,005 --> 00:59:22,981
Sit down.

730
00:59:23,082 --> 00:59:25,586
Bye. -Hi.

731
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,887
Something happened to me ... And me.

732
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:34,784
No, I mean before ...

733
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:36,585
Before you, before us.

734
00:59:36,586 --> 00:59:41,786
Gus, I do not care what happened before we met.

735
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:54,483
Incredibly beautiful.

736
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,600
I do not want to lose. I want to keep it, you want to keep.

737
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:08,101
I want to keep your eyes your lips, your scent.

738
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,002
You smell the tulips.

739
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:19,409
What is it? Nothing. I'll let the music.

740
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,906
Are you filming us?

741
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:28,607
Just tonight or ...

742
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:32,208
Each of our meeting? I can not explain.

743
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:35,709
What are you going to do with it? Published on the internet?

744
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:39,350
No, why would I do that? I do not know. You're the one who takes us.

745
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,151
Do you have any cameras? I can not believe I did not anticipate.

746
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,100
You misunderstood. I'm sorry, I have to go.

747
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,001
I wanted to tell you, but you did not listen. Stop it!

748
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:52,102
My mind is not right. Every morning, I forget everything.

749
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,403
Stop it! I should listen to Jolene! How stupid of me!

750
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,404
You did not! Molly, you're stupid!

751
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:05,101
Oh, my God!

752
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:21,598
Molly, stop!

753
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,595
There is little uncertainty in your life. A little?

754
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:12,896
Much uncertainty. Everyone has questions.

755
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,797
Believe me, we all struggle with it. -I do not know where I am when I wake up!

756
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:22,098
I do not know what to do that day, in which city I live in, what we do.

757
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:25,749
I need a script that I knew what I was doing yesterday, whom I saw.

758
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,900
What people know whom should I believe?

759
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,101
And it will never change.

760
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,202
What should I do about it?

761
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:38,603
Try to go slowly.

762
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:41,704
With what you need to know to spend the day.

763
01:02:45,505 --> 01:02:49,001
Is it possible to fall in love with someone every day?

764
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:55,598
No, Gustaf. Would not we all like that?

765
01:02:57,099 --> 01:03:00,095
It's over, is not it?

766
01:03:38,703 --> 01:03:41,409
Good morning. -Good morning.

767
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,040
I'm early.

768
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:48,211
I did not sleep well last night. -Today, no flowers?

769
01:03:48,352 --> 01:03:51,912
Returning to the artificial, Baptiste. You win.

770
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,619
Something wrong? What is it?

771
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,716
You're not as usual.

772
01:04:00,817 --> 01:04:04,417
You're scaring me! What is going on? -Did you hear about the execution?

773
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:05,918
You mean as a decoration?

774
01:04:06,019 --> 01:04:09,419
As a student loan, like when you take part of government wages,

775
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,420
before you get.

776
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,620
I'm sorry, Molly.

777
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,721
This is ... I can not live without a salary!

778
01:04:23,022 --> 01:04:26,622
I have to work I would go to college.

779
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:30,919
What should I do?

780
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,816
Here you go. I do not ...

781
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:43,817
I can not take it. Too.

782
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,114
Thank you, Baptiste!

783
01:04:51,815 --> 01:04:55,115
It's all right, Molly. It's okay.

784
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:58,516
I do not understand. I scheduled.

785
01:05:00,017 --> 01:05:03,800
The insurance company. Wolves do not want to admit the shelf.

786
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,200
Because of me? I can not work without insurance

787
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:11,301
and they will not renew my insurance if you keep.

788
01:05:12,602 --> 01:05:15,202
Sam, firing me?

789
01:05:16,903 --> 01:05:22,199
Listen, friends of your parents have a place in a chemical cleaner's.

790
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:25,600
Can you call them ... Sam, Sam ...

791
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:28,601
It's okay. See you.

792
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:34,398
I do not want a trainee, I want a real lawyer

793
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,799
which will deal with my case.

794
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,100
I'm tired of wrangling, it's been for two years.

795
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,000
I'm dying here.

796
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:46,201
Have him call me.

797
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,970
I Hi, this is Jolene and Molly. Saèekajte signal. </ I>

798
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,371
Molly, Gus. I really ... </ i>

799
01:05:55,572 --> 01:05:59,572
Do not call me, Gus. Forget you ever met me.

800
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,669
I My girlfriend Molly </ i>

801
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,366
I do not care that score?

802
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:38,967
Not really. This is my last lecture, I give up.

803
01:06:39,168 --> 01:06:43,268
I'm sorry to hear that. I have no choice, so ...

804
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:47,269
Check your work.

805
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,766
Frankly, I was skeptical about you, but that you did a great.

806
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:59,167
Plan with cvjeæarnicom could succeed.

807
01:07:00,168 --> 01:07:03,168
Thank you, Professor. Lawrence.

808
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:06,169
You'll keep that in mind.

809
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:34,266
Who is it? Gus, is that you?

810
01:07:35,667 --> 01:07:38,673
What is it, Gus?

811
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:44,370
Your when it flooded my living room, my system, all ...

812
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:47,071
I must have fallen asleep on the couch ...

813
01:07:47,472 --> 01:07:51,372
I am very sorry. I'll take care of everything, as far as cost.

814
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:55,073
What is necessary, Gus? Everything is destroyed.

815
01:07:59,474 --> 01:08:02,180
Sorry!

816
01:08:08,101 --> 01:08:12,077
Molly Branford from 417 Sign-in here.

817
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:21,374
Thank you.

818
01:08:25,575 --> 01:08:27,971
It has arrived.

819
01:08:28,272 --> 01:08:32,372
You did it! $ 234,000!

820
01:08:32,473 --> 01:08:35,773
Enough to start a new life.

821
01:08:35,774 --> 01:08:39,374
You'll go back to college? -No. I want to repay the loans,

822
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:44,626
find their own apartment, a car that works and rent space for cvjeæarnicu.

823
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:49,050
No longer the delayed. No more excuses.

824
01:08:56,148 --> 01:09:00,548
Hello? -Girl! Profit'll cardiac.

825
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,249
I'm so sorry. You're Molly.

826
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,550
What happened? -Long story.

827
01:09:07,751 --> 01:09:11,851
I'm sorry, who are you? Lucy, Gus's sister.

828
01:09:12,852 --> 01:09:16,352
I came here just to put something back.

829
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:21,053
I wanted to tell him that I'm leaving, I'm moving out.

830
01:09:21,354 --> 01:09:24,354
Can you tell him goodbye for me ...

831
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:27,555
Actually, do not. He's in the hospital.

832
01:09:27,856 --> 01:09:31,056
Observation. He'll be fine.

833
01:09:32,357 --> 01:09:35,257
Would you like to sit?

834
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:40,354
I think I was trying to say.

835
01:09:40,555 --> 01:09:43,555
Every day he had to re-learn who I am?

836
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:48,556
It happened on the 9th March

837
01:09:48,757 --> 01:09:56,358
His brain has suffered prsnuæe anterior communicating artery in the hippocampus.

838
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:59,309
In other words, his brain is overheated.

839
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,159
He lost everything, right?

840
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:08,656
News Week, The New York Times, London Times,

841
01:10:08,857 --> 01:10:13,257
The Washington Post, World Conference of scientists ...

842
01:10:13,658 --> 01:10:17,654
He worked on quintessencelike.

843
01:10:18,555 --> 01:10:23,755
Still works. He was supposed to be the next Einstein.

844
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:26,656
I wish you knew him then.

845
01:10:26,757 --> 01:10:30,057
When did this happen? In March 2009th year?

846
01:10:32,658 --> 01:10:35,754
This is the last thing that remembers?

847
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:41,656
Old memories of him remain forever losing sleep but new memories.

848
01:10:41,857 --> 01:10:45,057
At first he tried to stay awake.

849
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:47,258
So when he wakes up ...

850
01:10:48,259 --> 01:10:52,959
It must again learn about everything new in your life. Like you.

851
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,556
I found this morning in the trash.

852
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,553
We're out of fine desserts, but I have found you some pudding.

853
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:13,554
Thank you.

854
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:16,555
This is for you.

855
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,356
Thank you.

856
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:22,007
I press play </ i>

857
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,904
I Hi Gus, Molly here. </ i>

858
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,905
I do not remember me, but I'm your girl. </ i>

859
01:11:33,006 --> 01:11:36,206
Or at least I was. We had a misunderstanding. </ I>

860
01:11:36,347 --> 01:11:39,207
I I've had. But it's over. </ I>

861
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:42,408
I think you know better now and I hope we can </ i>

862
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,909
I start again because I fell in love with you. </ i>

863
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:49,310
I think that you and you feel the same. </ i>

864
01:11:49,311 --> 01:11:52,811
That's me on the recorder.

865
01:11:56,002 --> 01:12:00,608
Hi, Molly recorder.

866
01:12:01,509 --> 01:12:04,509
Please, sit down.

867
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:15,506
I'm sorry, I do not remember you.

868
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:20,803
In fact, somehow and remember.

869
01:12:32,304 --> 01:12:36,100
I made it about you? -Yes.

870
01:12:36,901 --> 01:12:40,281
To be able to keep things

871
01:12:40,382 --> 01:12:43,782
although it had every day poèinjati again

872
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:47,483
anyway we can develop our story in. .. -To build something.

873
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:50,680
Yes.

874
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:57,781
I spent a long time waiting for something to happen.

875
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:03,378
I may have even blamed some people for their problems,

876
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:06,479
forgetting that I was alone responsible for their decisions.

877
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,780
But it ended.

878
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:13,781
I'm ready to take control of your life in. ..

879
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:17,782
I hope I will do that for you.

880
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,499
Shvaæaš to ...

881
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,900
All you'll ever have a day

882
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:34,197
and many old juèerašnjih days.

883
01:13:34,798 --> 01:13:38,198
No, you got me.

884
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,995
Can you ...

885
01:13:46,096 --> 01:13:50,296
You can get a little closer? Why? I wrote good?

886
01:14:02,107 --> 01:14:05,393
How could I forget?

887
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,190
Hi, Molly.

888
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:16,991
Bye.

889
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:25,588
As I said, it is a special occasion.

890
01:14:26,589 --> 01:14:29,989
Yes, you started talking. What's going on?

891
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:33,590
I discovered an exciting opportunity.

892
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:36,391
And that is?

893
01:14:36,492 --> 01:14:39,092
There is a new laser surgery.

894
01:14:39,293 --> 01:14:42,093
Let me show you.

895
01:14:42,694 --> 01:14:47,894
This is a photo of the brain, much like what is yours.

896
01:14:49,895 --> 01:14:53,191
This is a photo of the same brain, but patient.

897
01:14:57,092 --> 01:15:00,488
They have not perfected the process, but are close.

898
01:15:00,689 --> 01:15:03,589
Anticipate great success.

899
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:07,490
Gus, this might help.

900
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:11,491
I do not know ... Are you sure? You're the perfect candidate.

901
01:15:11,692 --> 01:15:15,692
Young, healthy, we just need to fill out paperwork.

902
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:19,289
I can not pay. -No.

903
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:23,290
I want nothing more than that, but I can not let you pay.

904
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:27,991
Before odluèiš, I'd take you to a place.

905
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,698
Where? -Sunday.

906
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:35,329
I want to take you somewhere where we can talk some more about it.

907
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,830
We'll just leave. Just the two of us.

908
01:15:40,131 --> 01:15:44,031
Gus, remember Sunday.

909
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:49,828
Okay? -I remember.

910
01:16:00,274 --> 01:16:05,674
Remember to ask for the surgery and remember to ask ...

911
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,971
Molly? Hi, stranèe.

912
01:16:14,072 --> 01:16:16,672
Yes, Molly.

913
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,769
So, where are you taking me?

914
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:30,170
Sorry, I'm taking you somewhere?

915
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:32,871
Here you go.

916
01:16:32,972 --> 01:16:36,872
Airline tickets to Los Angeles.

917
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:41,573
I want to see where you come from. I want to know what proportion taken remember.

918
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,600
So that's it? Here you doing?

919
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:54,601
Yes, in that big, with the biggest telescopes.

920
01:16:56,602 --> 01:17:02,002
I think you can not go in there. I thought I might be able to, but I can not.

921
01:17:02,037 --> 01:17:03,903
Why?

922
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:06,904
Please.

923
01:17:07,105 --> 01:17:10,905
I can not. I'm so sorry. Can we get back to the hotel?

924
01:17:11,506 --> 01:17:14,456
I thought you'd want to see this place again.

925
01:17:14,457 --> 01:17:16,006
You do not have to watch it.

926
01:17:16,407 --> 01:17:20,007
I see it every morning when wake-up call, every night before bedtime.

927
01:17:20,108 --> 01:17:23,308
I can not stop watching.

928
01:17:23,509 --> 01:17:28,610
It represents everything I ever wanted, all whereof I had to give up,

929
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:31,010
all I have taken and now I'm alone!

930
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:34,111
You are no longer alone.

931
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,400
I was there when it happened.

932
01:17:41,701 --> 01:17:44,901
That's the last thing I remember, and whereof I always to remember.

933
01:17:44,902 --> 01:17:46,601
Gus, I'm sorry. I did not know.

934
01:17:47,502 --> 01:17:51,198
But I should know. If we try together,

935
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:54,499
I must be the person to whom you'll be able to tell you.

936
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,500
Please, just a little show.

937
01:17:59,001 --> 01:18:02,601
Do not ask me, please.

938
01:18:02,802 --> 01:18:05,802
Then I see myself.

939
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:30,899
This is incredible!

940
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,196
This is your office.

941
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,147
That was my life.

942
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:43,848
Everything I learned about the universe through the big glass.

943
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,498
Through you watched?

944
01:18:46,899 --> 01:18:49,795
Who's there? We're all here.

945
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:52,496
Bilmos, Lukrey ...

946
01:18:52,697 --> 01:18:56,197
Welcome back, Dr. Gillenwater. -Welcome home, Gus.

947
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:59,573
We're pretty busy lately.

948
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:02,248
Ruth was worried whether I want to go back home at all.

949
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:06,349
Still not over and there are still a lot of work,

950
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:10,350
but I think it will be interesting to you. Krida, show the chart.

951
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:14,351
Here it comes. -Prepare.

952
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,648
What are you doing? -Wait ...

953
01:19:22,849 --> 01:19:25,649
Is this verified? For now.

954
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,850
If it still continues, will definitely change things.

955
01:19:28,951 --> 01:19:31,651
Gus, this is your report.

956
01:19:32,652 --> 01:19:35,352
Fast facts?

957
01:19:35,553 --> 01:19:38,553
Quintessence? Molly gave them to us.

958
01:19:38,654 --> 01:19:40,804
When she called to make an appointment.

959
01:19:40,805 --> 01:19:44,955
I sent your note, I thought you were finished, how do I know.

960
01:19:44,956 --> 01:19:46,755
Putting it mildly.

961
01:19:46,856 --> 01:19:49,256
If these data are correct, we have just found

962
01:19:49,257 --> 01:19:51,656
way for the monitoring of dark energy in the universe.

963
01:19:51,857 --> 01:19:55,057
And if we can ... Then we will know the fate of the universe.

964
01:19:55,258 --> 01:19:59,058
We call I Gillenwaterov effect. </ I> We hope you do not mind.

965
01:19:59,259 --> 01:20:03,959
So will the whole world be called. This can not be forgotten.

966
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,506
Thank you, guys. Thank you all.

967
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:12,307
Honey, thank you.

968
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:22,105
It used were not so long ago, giants like Hubble, even Einstein

969
01:20:22,306 --> 01:20:25,106
stood exactly there where you're standing.

970
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:28,879
I have used this same telescope to

971
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,508
changed our view of the universe forever.

972
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:38,005
Shivering! Are you cold? It's not from the cold.

973
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:41,906
Oh, yeah. -Maybe a little cold.

974
01:20:42,907 --> 01:20:45,407
Here you go.

975
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:50,008
Thank you. In what I see now?

976
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:53,610
United light of millions of stars.

977
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:56,511
I could watch it forever.

978
01:20:56,512 --> 01:21:02,012
Actually, could it because the universe is not only expanding but also accelerating.

979
01:21:02,213 --> 01:21:06,013
There is simply no end. We know that now.

980
01:21:06,214 --> 01:21:10,014
Forever. Comforting, is not it? -Gillenwaterov effect.

981
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,511
I Do not forget to ask. </ i> What? -Gus!

982
01:21:15,712 --> 01:21:17,462
Thank God you're still here.

983
01:21:18,163 --> 01:21:21,212
I wanted to sell a few more questions before you go.

984
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:23,013
Will take only a few minutes.

985
01:21:23,014 --> 01:21:25,814
Go ahead, I'll wait in the car. -Good.

986
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,111
Bye. -Hi.

987
01:21:34,212 --> 01:21:37,112
Have enjoyed the visit? -Yes.

988
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:41,813
Everything is wonderful! Telescope ... Unbelievable, is not it?

989
01:21:42,014 --> 01:21:44,814
More is not used much, but ...

990
01:21:45,415 --> 01:21:49,315
Good night. -I wanted to thank you.

991
01:21:49,516 --> 01:21:53,616
Sure. For what? -Because Gus.

992
01:21:54,017 --> 01:21:57,517
What did you bring him here and helped him.

993
01:21:57,618 --> 01:22:00,818
I'm Molly Branford. I do not know if we are already acquainted ...

994
01:22:01,019 --> 01:22:04,819
They told me they'll come today, I just did not want to disturb.

995
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:09,720
I'm Lauren Reynolds. Did I ever mention that?

996
01:22:14,321 --> 01:22:18,617
We worked together and we were engaged.

997
01:22:27,418 --> 01:22:31,414
I assumed that someone had, but I did not know.

998
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:35,415
What happened?

999
01:22:36,216 --> 01:22:40,216
We were in love, then an aneurysm in. ..

1000
01:22:40,617 --> 01:22:43,817
For months I tried.

1001
01:22:44,018 --> 01:22:48,018
His sister had decided to take, and I wanted to go but ...

1002
01:22:48,219 --> 01:22:51,019
In the end I could not.

1003
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,720
You left him. But not for him.

1004
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:59,421
I wanted to have children. We could have just ...

1005
01:22:59,722 --> 01:23:03,722
them he would not be remembered. -Yes.

1006
01:23:07,223 --> 01:23:11,419
Do not tell him to meet you. Better that way.

1007
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,120
We're sorry. Molly, I'm glad that I met you.

1008
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:17,421
Me too.

1009
01:23:29,022 --> 01:23:32,718
Are you okay? What is it? I'm fine.

1010
01:23:36,019 --> 01:23:39,669
Do you wake up every morning expecting that you'll

1011
01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:43,519
be here to work with your friends?

1012
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:50,126
Every morning I wake up I'm not sure of anything.

1013
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,623
Molly, I want to try with that operation. Really?

1014
01:23:59,224 --> 01:24:02,624
Gus, it's ... -Molly!

1015
01:24:04,525 --> 01:24:13,818
If the operation fails, I want to tell me something obeæaš.

1016
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:18,867
I want you to obeæaš you'd forget me

1017
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:22,116
and delete it from my life. What? I will not!

1018
01:24:22,317 --> 01:24:25,117
Listen to me!

1019
01:24:25,318 --> 01:24:28,118
When I'm with you all seems fine.

1020
01:24:31,019 --> 01:24:34,415
I wish I would have been enough.

1021
01:24:35,616 --> 01:24:39,012
Never and I'm not going to remember in the morning.

1022
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:43,109
And you deserve more than that.

1023
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:47,710
Only on this condition I will go into surgery. Either that or nothing.

1024
01:24:50,611 --> 01:24:53,407
Promise me, Molly.

1025
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:58,304
Will you promise me?

1026
01:25:03,305 --> 01:25:05,805
Thank you.

1027
01:25:18,806 --> 01:25:22,102
Hey sis. -Let me help you.

1028
01:25:23,003 --> 01:25:25,803
Are we supposed to find? -No.

1029
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:28,054
I knew that you went with her the conductor

1030
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:30,204
so I decided to update the computer.

1031
01:25:30,405 --> 01:25:34,605
I'll be back tomorrow and I'll explain everything. Where were you?

1032
01:25:35,406 --> 01:25:38,606
The Mount Wilson.

1033
01:25:40,007 --> 01:25:43,807
Will we take this to the car? Green VW Beetle.

1034
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,904
Be right back.

1035
01:25:52,805 --> 01:25:56,001
It's not easy to him, but you gotta love it.

1036
01:25:56,150 --> 01:25:59,702
And I really love it. I have to warn you.

1037
01:25:59,903 --> 01:26:03,303
Do not count on it that he will be better.

1038
01:26:03,504 --> 01:26:07,504
What is the one brochure for the hospital? -Gus is interested.

1039

and then return to orbit and scientists understand

1129
01:35:15,913 --> 01:35:18,813
that in fact nothing is lost.

1130
01:35:20,114 --> 01:35:23,120
