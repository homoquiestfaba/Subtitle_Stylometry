1
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,959
The mind plays tricks on you.

2
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,510
Now you see me,

3
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,459
now you don't.

4
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:11,843
You better be careful.

5
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,876
We're watching you.

6
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
Get out.

7
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,223
Now.

8
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,372
Teresa?

9
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,943
How was Mexico?

10
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,125
You okay?

11
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,197
Talk to me.

12
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,654
I'm thinking of doing
something bad.

13
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,443
Doesn't matter if it's bad,

14
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:33,347
but a knife like that is not
going to get you very far.

15
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,020
I know where we can
find a lot of money.

16
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,178
I just don't want to

17
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,221
do it alone.

18
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,465
How many people know about it?

19
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,192
Well,

20
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,964
my brothers and my sister.

21
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:54,867
That's too many people.

22
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,859
Look, the first rule
of being a criminal,

23
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,295
don't steal with more
than two people.

24
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,617
I really need you on this.

25
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,725
This is our chance.

26
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,941
We could have all this money and get
the things that we really want.

27
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,124
I, I don't think we can.

28
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,592
Please.

29
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,810
Where's grandma?

30
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,370
Gavin?

31
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:57,844
Gavin, open up.

32
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,410
I know you're in there.

33
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,527
Who told you I was here?

34
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,533
Hannah.

35
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,436
Lovely.

36
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:25,772
Yeah.

37
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,403
She's been a rat ever since
we were little kids.

38
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
You know,

39
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,742
I really hate seeing
you living like this.

40
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,380
Well, are you going
to ask why I'm here?

41
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,610
You know, what
difference does it make?

42
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,971
Why don't you just say your bullshit
speech and just leave, okay?

43
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:03,676
You know what?

44
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,516
I should just let you drive this
piece of shit van right back

45
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:13,245
down joy road over there, so you
can find out what just happened.

46
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,831
They found grandma dead.

47
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,635
What?

48
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,875
Oh my God.

49
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,616
Don't start that shit now.

50
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,654
I know you and I know these
tears they don't mean shit!

51
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,977
How can you say that shit to me?

52
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,093
I mean look how I'm living.

53
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:55,970
Oh, so what?
You're going to blame me now?

54
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:56,995
It's my fault?

55
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:03,037
Do you, do you remember when you
wanted to turn eighteen so badly?

56
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,877
Well, here it is. Guess what?

57
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,064
This is adulthood

58
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:11,997
in full effect.

59
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,382
It's sink or swim now kid because
you're not a little girl anymore.

60
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,499
And these tears, nobody
gives a shit about them.

61
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,633
No one cares that you're crying.

62
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,101
No one cares that you're broke.

63
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,358
And no one gives a shit if
you live in a fucking van!

64
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,109
Hello.

65
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,311
Hi.

66
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,081
I'm sorry.

67
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,469
I was just looking
at your purse.

68
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,985
Excuse me?

69
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,240
Yeah, it's, um, really pretty.

70
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,011
Well, thank you.

71
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,440
So, is that hot
chocolate or coffee?

72
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,958
Not that it matters.

73
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:44,501
Yeah, um, I just wanted

74
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,671
to buy a hot chocolate,

75
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:53,902
but, this is embarrassing, but I
don't have enough money so...

76
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,825
Well, I think I can help you.

77
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,690
Thank you.

78
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:16,902
$5?

79
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,655
Is that really all you
could come up with?

80
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,361
You're kidding?

81
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,356
No, um, actually,
actually I'm not.

82
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,956
So, why don't you reach into

83
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,783
that pretty little purse
and try a little harder.

84
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,153
You're crazy.

85
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,110
You're not getting this $5 back.

86
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,732
I don't know if you noticed but
I'm a police officer and you

87
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,004
know you need to go get a job.

88
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,767
I've been looking for a job
actually, um, for months

89
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,438
and not a single one called me so...
um, I lost my mom,

90
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,066
I lost grandma, I lost my house.

91
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,814
So, don't act so
surprised, okay?

92
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,058
Because you know the same thing

93
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,716
that happened to me
could happen to anyone.

94
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,956
I'm sorry.

95
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,113
I'm really sorry.

96
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:25,370
We got a call from DPD.

97
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:31,851
I was put on the case two days
after we found the grandmother.

98
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,826
We began our search in the
woods looking for where her

99
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,381
granddaughter Gavin had
parked and lived in her van.

100
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,266
We'd like to talk to the oldest

101
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,591
granddaughter Teresa,
but no one's seen her.

102
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,628
So, what do you really think
happened to the grandmother?

103
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,023
I don't know.

104
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,682
Well, how do you
feel about the case?

105
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,242
I don't.

106
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,652
It doesn't look like anything is
going to show up here either.

107
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,891
That's good coffee.

108
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:32,872
Come in.

109
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,349
Kelogg?

110
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,286
That's me.

111
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,698
Like the breakfast of champions.

112
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,620
Speaking of champions, to the
right is investigator Zod.

113
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,528
To the left my assistant.

114
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,968
I assume the administrator
at the agency contacted you?

115
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,001
She sure did.

116
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,336
Hold on.

117
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Right.

118
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,575
Have a seat.

119
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,914
I can't sit when my
company is losing money.

120
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,569
Then let's get down to business.

121
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,132
I'll need names, addresses, shoe
sizes, bra sizes, the works.

122
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,684
My company makes
$100 million a year.

123
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,160
The money goes from the
customer's account to us.

124
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,098
The customer contacts us to cash
in, if we have to pay, we pay.

125
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,632
If we don't, we don't.

126
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,876
My job is to find a
reason not to pay.

127
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,409
Sounds like you got a
pretty fucked up job.

128
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:47,054
It's a fucked up world.

129
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,099
And then some.

130
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,644
And we're all in it.

131
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,777
What about you Zod?

132
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,782
Standing here for a few
minutes, haven't said a word.

133
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,257
You talk?

134
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,914
Only when I've got
something to say.

135
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,259
That works.

136
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,030
What about you sweetheart?

137
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:06,270
You just another pretty face?

138
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,331
She's fucking useless unless you
want a blowjob as a partial payment.

139
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,415
I never mix business
with pleasure.

140
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,528
That's my motto.

141
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,768
The envelope please.

142
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,424
Everything you need to start

143
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,739
is either in that envelope
or in Zod's head.

144
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,265
I hope Zod doesn't let us down.

145
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,334
I don't get let down, Kelogg.

146
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,301
I'm the guy that sends the
letters to the clients letting

147
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,407
them know that their
claim has been denied,

148
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,405
especially if it ain't legit.

149
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:43,669
All right.

150
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,648
Give me a few days and
I'll get back to you.

151
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,238
Thanks for your time.

152
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Thank you.

153
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,813
Any reason why
you're still here?

154
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,336
Well, I thought we'd take a few
minutes to get to know each other.

155
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,321
Well, I hate to let you
down, but I'm not looking

156
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,261
to get to know anybody.

157
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:16,270
So, if you don't mind...
So, you want me to leave?

158
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:19,005
Well, you catch on fast.

159
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:21,076
Aren't you ready to work?

160
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,807
Well, I'm not doing anything
until this check clears.

161
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,015
So, you want me to leave?

162
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,905
You're starting to get
on my nerves, Zod.

163
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,499
So, in plain English
take a walk.

164
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,820
Get the fuck out of here!

165
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,553
It's been a long day.

166
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,768
Hey, you okay?

167
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,484
Mexico didn't work out.

168
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,955
Gavin can't be trusted.

169
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:03,063
She went there without us.

170
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,753
There's now two people missing.

171
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,694
The second being
Teresa's brother red.

172
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,473
One picture tells it all.

173
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:42,913
♪ Eery music ♪

174
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:29,387
How are you today?

175
00:35:31,097 --> 00:35:32,390
I've been better.

176
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,704
Well, let's just get down
to business, shall we?

177
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,813
Your grandmother set up a trust

178
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:41,436
fund for all the family members
named on this document.

179
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,317
My name is on there, right?

180
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,430
Yes, of course,

181
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,190
but due to the terms of
the agreement we need the

182
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,256
signatures of all the parties.

183
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,914
All four beneficiaries,

184
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:55,345
including yourself.

185
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,988
Um, I was hoping Blake

186
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:01,793
would be here.

187
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,362
Oh, yes.

188
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,063
He was here.

189
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,507
He signed both copies and left.

190
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:10,068
What?

191
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,168
Hmm-mm.

192
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,435
Um, would you mind if

193
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,897
I take some time to
look over these?

194
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,817
But I was hired to do that.

195
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,847
I, I know...

196
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:30,649
I just want to fully understand what
I'm signing through my own eyes.

197
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,467
Oh, so now you're
practicing law.

198
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:35,533
Is that how it is, young lady?

199
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,318
No. Um, actually,

200
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,696
I want to have my own
attorney look at this.

201
00:36:42,835 --> 00:36:43,835
Why?

202
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:47,472
Excuse me?

203
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,201
What's the matter?

204
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,434
You don't trust me?

205
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:55,813
No.

206
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,449
Hmm, fine.

207
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,360
Don't sign it.

208
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,385
Fine by me.

209
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,297
Don't sign a damn thing.

210
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,499
Let me explain something to you.

211
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,628
All that matters is what's
written on this document.

212
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:15,326
Not your views, not your
opinions, and not your lawyer.

213
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,965
So, if I were you I'd
give it a chance,

214
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
you know.

215
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,331
Roll the dice and

216
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:28,245
sign on the dotted line.

217
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:36,987
Let's go.

218
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,557
Sign it.

219
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,172
Piece of shit!

220
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:10,109
Piece of shit?

221
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,199
If I'm a piece of shit then what
the fuck does that make you?

222
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,081
You're the one living
in a goddamn van.

223
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,302
Why? Just tell me why
did you go to the

224
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,871
attorney's office
and then leave?

225
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:18,629
Leave before I got there?

226
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,574
Why?
What's the big problem?

227
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,109
You know what my problem is?

228
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,643
Fucking you know what
I've been going through.

229
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,911
I have no place to live.

230
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,947
I'm living in a fucking van
picking through garbage while

231
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,116
you're fucking eating real food.

232
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:30,207
Shut up.
That's what my problem is.

233
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,376
Come on.
Shut up.

234
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,446
Gavin, come on.
No.

235
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:36,413
You know what?
You come on.

236
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,924
I mean I used to think, I
used to think that you

237
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,326
actually cared about
me, but now I know.

238
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,697
Now I know you don't
give a shit about me.

239
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,186
So,

240
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,453
that's what you think?

241
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,335
You think I don't give a shit?

242
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,969
You know what your problem is?

243
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,906
Is that you never appreciate a

244
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:53,882
goddamn thing that anybody
does for you ever!

245
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:57,894
Give me something to
appreciate and I fucking will!

246
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,303
God!

247
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,348
I don't even know who
you are anymore.

248
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:02,415
I'm your goddamn sister.

249
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,528
That's who I am.

250
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,366
But you know what
that means to me?

251
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,678
It only means that we came
from the same fucking mother.

252
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,547
I hate you.

253
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:33,003
Fuck!

254
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,405
Fuck!

255
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:36,474
Fuck!

256
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,516
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

257
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,271
Kelogg.

258
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,705
Can I help you guys?

259
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,907
Maybe we can help you.

260
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,491
You can start by telling me why
the fuck you got my sunglasses.

261
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,476
They were sitting on that
table over there before.

262
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,088
So nobody would take them.

263
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,374
You guys cops?

264
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,347
You looking to make
a police report?

265
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,231
Have a seat.
Come on.

266
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,199
Go ahead.

267
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,650
You haven't
answered my question.

268
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,026
You still haven't answered mine.

269
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,035
Well, fire away.

270
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,476
I'm attorney Kelogg.

271
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,751
This is investigator Zod.

272
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,151
And this is good coffee.

273
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:57,255
It sure is.

274
00:41:00,192 --> 00:41:03,460
Listen, I know you guys aren't here
about talking about no goddamn coffee.

275
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,624
And now that I know that
you're both not cops,

276
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,996
you guys got about two minutes before
I kick you the fuck out of here.

277
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,632
The insurance company has a few questions
to ask about the death of your grandmother.

278
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,706
What do you want to know?
She's dead.

279
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,414
Just a couple of questions.

280
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,052
Just a couple of questions?

281
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,908
What the fuck are
you looking at?

282
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,307
Just answer the man's questions.

283
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,322
Fine.

284
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,667
I'll answer one question and you

285
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,263
better make it a good one.

286
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,197
Well,

287
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,366
I'm not going to kiss your
ass to get this information.

288
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,413
You don't want to talk to me?

289
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,438
Then don't.

290
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,641
Great.

291
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,190
Then you and your buddy can
get the fuck out of here.

292
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,924
I think we better leave before

293
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:02,151
something happens that
we'll be very sorry for.

294
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,093
Your sister is still
living in a van.

295
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,398
Who cares?

296
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,956
You're all hard Blake.
Change your mind,

297
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:20,444
you want to talk, call me.

298
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,173
I'm listed.
Kelogg.

299
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,970
Like the corn flakes.

300
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:44,193
Excuse me?

301
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,802
Hello?
Can I get some towels please?

302
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:51,202
My room is out of towels.

303
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:54,804
Hello?

304
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:14,783
Hey, um, it's me.

305
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,603
Just listen, okay?

306
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:17,989
I used the spare key

307
00:43:19,565 --> 00:43:23,300
and I put, um, an envelope in a
shoebox under your bed, okay?

308
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:26,712
And, um, just don't
try to contact me.

309
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,301
Don't try to call me
or text or anything.

310
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,783
Let's just let this whole thing
play out and we'll talk after.

311
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:35,827
No. Please. No.

312
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:37,574
No. No. No.

313
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:39,744
No. No.

314
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,056
What am I doing here?

315
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,780
Gavin, Gavin.

316
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,724
We see you Gavin.

317
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:28,805
We know why you're here.

318
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:31,942
Do you?

319
00:48:32,878 --> 00:48:37,634
It's very important that you follow
our instructions or you may die.

320
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:45,622
What?

321
00:48:45,724 --> 00:48:47,289
Tell us about Mexico.

322
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,871
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

323
00:48:50,896 --> 00:48:53,596
Aw, you disappoint us Gavin.

324
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,622
Is this someone's idea
of a fucking joke?

325
00:48:57,536 --> 00:48:59,212
What the fuck are you writing?

326
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,117
There are two types of
drinks in front of you.

327
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,506
One of them you'll love,

328
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,472
which one will it be?

329
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,859
I drank the fucking
water, asshole.

330
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:13,940
It's hot in here.

331
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,093
Hello, motherfucker.

332
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,190
You're one annoying
son of a bitch.

333
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:47,506
Red head. Red head.

334
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:51,715
Ready to talk?

335
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:53,341
Talk? About what?

336
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:57,515
The fucking weather?

337
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:06,200
- Tell us about Mexico.
- Starts with the letter "M."

338
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,065
Assholes.

339
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,617
You guys said I'd figure it out.

340
00:51:17,976 --> 00:51:19,745
You said if I thought hard

341
00:51:21,045 --> 00:51:25,967
enough this fucking brain of mine
would figure out why I'm here.

342
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:29,952
Well, I can't.

343
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,950
What the fuck you keep
looking at me for?

344
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:45,565
Shall I add some more

345
00:51:46,905 --> 00:51:47,905
piss to it?

346
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,342
Fuckers.

347
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,349
Dirty girl.

348
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:03,741
Oh, dirty girl.

349
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:09,052
We're watching you.

350
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,620
We're watching you.

351
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,358
We're watching you.

352
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:24,417
When someone goes missing

353
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:26,162
the answer is usually
right under your nose.

354
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:29,239
Someone trusted someone
they shouldn't have.

355
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,090
You just have to figure it out.

356
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:14,617
Hello?

357
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:17,221
It's me.

358
00:54:17,222 --> 00:54:18,222
Are you busy?

359
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:20,523
No, I'm not.

360
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:24,728
I'd rather be getting drilled
right about now by Jimmy,

361
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,931
but that's not happening.

362
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,231
Why?

363
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,432
What's up?

364
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:31,623
I need to talk.

365
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,112
Okay, so start talking.

366
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,042
Well, I wanted to come by.

367
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,061
Well, drop by.

368
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,266
Wait, wait, wait.

369
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:44,045
You're not parked outside or some
strange shit like that are you?

370
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:45,916
No.

371
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,384
All right.

372
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:48,678
Well, I'll be here.

373
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,899
Okay, bye-bye.

374
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,816
Digging for gold?

375
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:33,163
Nope.

376
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,189
Digging for gold means
digging up my ass.

377
00:55:37,268 --> 00:55:39,723
Got anymore piss
for me to drink?

378
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:42,040
Why don't we have a talk?

379
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,041
Fuck you.

380
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:46,518
I don't want to talk to you.

381
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,244
You don't have a choice.

382
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,147
Hey, I do have a choice.

383
00:55:50,949 --> 00:55:52,324
Fucking piece of wood.

384
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,349
Oh!

385
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,518
Red,

386
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,364
you must cooperate or your
scheduled time will end sooner.

387
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:01,613
Scheduled time?

388
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,244
You are as nasty and
evil as we thought.

389
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,367
Meaning what?

390
00:56:13,338 --> 00:56:15,525
It will be harder for
us to kill your soul.

391
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,060
It will take longer for
your heart to stop,

392
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:22,745
but don't worry it will.

393
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,774
Red's going to die.

394
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,610
Red's going to die.

395
00:56:32,023 --> 00:56:33,860
Let me tell you something.

396
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,695
Before you brought me here,
before all this bullshit,

397
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,663
my life was dead anyway.

398
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:46,123
So, if you think you want
to kill me, go right ahead.

399
00:56:52,143 --> 00:56:53,143
Oh, shit.

400
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,148
Maybe the urine is finally
flushing out your soul.

401
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:03,686
Ugh, please.

402
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:06,766
I need to take a shit.

403
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:07,947
Go right ahead.

404
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:10,327
Ugh.

405
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,498
Need some toilet paper?

406
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,375
Hey.

407
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,121
Fuck.

408
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,312
Okay, Hannah.
What's going on?

409
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,868
I haven't been able to sleep.

410
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,572
Well, I can understand that.

411
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,366
You've been through a lot.

412
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:50,760
A lot has happened.

413
00:57:51,202 --> 00:57:54,633
Yeah, I tried talking to my
mom and she won't believe me.

414
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:57,700
She just won't
fucking believe me.

415
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:59,329
Believe what?

416
00:58:01,813 --> 00:58:03,310
I can show you better

417
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:05,875
than I can tell you.

418
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,655
Okay. Now, if you have to

419
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,465
warn me about something
now would be a good time.

420
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,490
No surprises.

421
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:16,358
Okay.

422
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:19,821
I'll be right back.

423
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,606
Are you expecting anybody?

424
00:59:22,293 --> 00:59:23,193
Ah!

425
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,246
It's just me.

426
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:27,023
God, don't fucking
do that shit again.

427
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,766
Fuck.

428
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,226
We found out about Mexico.

429
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:51,249
How, how did you
know about that?

430
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,300
That was a secret.

431
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,936
You had a secret.

432
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,344
We know your secret.

433
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,463
You've been a bad girl.

434
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:55,617
You like that?

435
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,496
Finally, something I do
gets your attention.

436
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:12,648
Red, red.

437
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:16,719
Shit.

438
01:04:17,822 --> 01:04:18,722
Stop.

439
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:19,755
I knew it.

440
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,832
Why don't you just stay
the fuck out of this?

441
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,638
I was entertaining that guy.

442
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,070
Not you.

443
01:04:36,507 --> 01:04:38,573
We know about your
anger problem, red.

444
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,535
Are you angry, red?

445
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,278
Or does this have to do

446
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,542
with your impotence?

447
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:50,650
How do you know that?

448
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,081
Where are you getting
this information?

449
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,123
That's it.

450
01:05:30,628 --> 01:05:32,329
May as well face reality.

451
01:05:37,635 --> 01:05:40,165
Never going to get
out of here alive.

452
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,072
Fuck.

453
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,906
We have asked you
to cooperate but you

454
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:52,248
have refused.

455
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:54,850
Still, you have survived

456
01:05:58,222 --> 01:05:59,651
longer than expected.

457
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,232
We have studied you and even

458
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:11,322
though you're alive right now we
believe that soon you will be dead.

459
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:18,907
Please.

460
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,362
You are weak.

461
01:06:22,012 --> 01:06:24,121
Staying alive is not an option.

462
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,137
Please, help me.

463
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,583
There's pleasure in

464
01:06:33,257 --> 01:06:34,618
watching you suffer.

465
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,146
The pleasure of

466
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:39,284
watching you die.

467
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,296
Don't look at my master.

468
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:47,103
Look at me!

469
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,005
Look at me!

470
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:52,108
Why?

471
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:54,742
Why are you doing this?

472
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,373
There is no reason.

473
01:06:58,382 --> 01:06:59,470
No one can help.

474
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:01,978
No one can help you.

475
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:08,091
Soon you'll be dehydrated.

476
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,516
Soon you'll lose
touch with reality.

477
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,004
Soon your heart will stop.

478
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:27,777
Dirty girl.

479
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,199
Oh, dirty girl.

480
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,302
Oh, dirty girl.

481
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:57,939
Door is locked.

482
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,940
I see that.

483
01:07:59,677 --> 01:08:01,854
You work here or are you a cop?

484
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,904
Most people come here are either
cops or looking for work.

485
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:08,951
Anyone here?

486
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:12,521
Go to the back door, knock,

487
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,080
and start praying.

488
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:56,506
Hi, I'm detective Smith, DPD.

489
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,693
What do you want?

490
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:03,749
I'm investigating the disappearance
of an employee here, red Cason.

491
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:04,850
Did you know him?

492
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:05,875
Did or do?

493
01:09:05,943 --> 01:09:08,387
Because I'm pretty sure those
mean two different things.

494
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:09,977
Okay, do you know him?

495
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,774
Yeah, I knew him.

496
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:15,346
But I don't know you.

497
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,364
Do you mind if I
take a look around?

498
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:20,750
Owner is not here.

499
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:24,519
I just want to take
a look around.

500
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,029
Look, I put my paycheck

501
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,401
in the gas tank, I
have two kids, no man.

502
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:36,234
You expect me to just
let you walk in here?

503
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,340
No.

504
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:39,978
I think I'd like some cash.

505
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,508
All right, thank you.

506
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:47,917
Excuse me.

507
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,375
I knew the secretary
was full of shit,

508
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:53,526
but I have to do what I have
to do to make sense of this.

509
01:13:21,698 --> 01:13:22,698
I'm scared.

510
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:26,053
I don't even really
know this guy.

511
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,534
I just got a message saying
to come to his office.

512
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:30,898
Can we trust him?

513
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,466
He's an attorney.

514
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,206
Yeah, how do you know that?

515
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,426
Come in.

516
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,168
Have a seat.

517
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:08,587
Why is she here?

518
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:09,836
Is she your lover?

519
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,904
She's my friend.

520
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:16,445
I prefer to speak to you
on this matter alone.

521
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:17,385
Really?

522
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:18,286
Then why is he here?

523
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,397
I don't know that fucker.

524
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:20,422
Hannah.

525
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,735
I pulled a few strings.

526
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,626
Had the investigator check into

527
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:28,429
the documents for the trust
your grandmother set up.

528
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,768
My mom gave me the original
when I turned 18 and said

529
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:33,335
I had money coming.

530
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,713
Well, it doesn't say that now.

531
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:35,894
Who changed it?

532
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:37,966
That we don't know.

533
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:40,738
Sir, I'm not trying

534
01:14:42,112 --> 01:14:43,200
to get anything.

535
01:14:43,447 --> 01:14:45,557
I mean if I have money
coming that's fine,

536
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:49,061
but my other relatives didn't
even have the decency to

537
01:14:49,086 --> 01:14:50,923
give her a fucking funeral.

538
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,380
There's two wills.

539
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,293
You can go to court,
challenge the authenticity

540
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,756
of the second one,
but that's about it.

541
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:01,463
I'm sorry.

542
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:06,400
My mom told me that my
grandmother kept money,

543
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:09,426
like literally hid
money everywhere.

544
01:15:11,475 --> 01:15:12,972
You got a map for it?

545
01:15:14,144 --> 01:15:16,321
Otherwise it's finder's keepers.

546
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,880
Thank you.

547
01:15:19,149 --> 01:15:21,347
Hannah, I've got one question.

548
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,146
What in the hell
happened in Mexico?

549
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:27,999
Gavin's mom disappeared there.

550
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,924
And did any of the authorities
get back to you at all?

551
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:32,795
No.

552
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:35,231
Well, now that's strange.

553
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:39,096
Because we were told that
they found her alive.

554
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,670
What?

555
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:42,638
Where is she?

556
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:44,204
My mom is worried sick.

557
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,516
We were hoping that you would
tell us what's going on.

558
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:54,692
Yeah. Aside from what we already
know, like the fact that you have a

559
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:58,694
strange fucking family and right
now we can't find any of them.

560
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:01,623
Can I go now?

561
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,224
Who asked you to stay?

562
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,932
You got something to say?

563
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,824
I didn't think so.

564
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:18,573
And close the door.

565
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,662
There's a draft.

566
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,945
I never could make
those circles.

567
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,804
Neither could I.
I've been smoking for years.

568
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:41,829
I can't do it.

569
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,399
It takes talent.

570
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,400
It does.

571
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:13,729
Morris, DPD.

572
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,641
You work for Goldstein?

573
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:17,666
Yes, I do.

574
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,056
Is he available?

575
01:17:20,237 --> 01:17:22,305
I'm sorry, but
nobody is here today.

576
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:24,232
Well, you're here.

577
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,574
Well, I'm just here to
finish some paperwork.

578
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:27,743
I see.

579
01:17:28,712 --> 01:17:30,762
You guys drafted a
will for a family.

580
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:35,392
This will was... Yes, Gavin was
here and so was her brother.

581
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,928
And we gave them as
well as the others

582
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:38,836
a full understanding
of the will.

583
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:41,298
I'm not here about the will.

584
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,810
This is now a murder
investigation.

585
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,570
So, any information that
you or attorney Goldstein

586
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,160
can give me would help.

587
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,307
Detective, we don't
give information about

588
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:53,455
our cases or our clients
for any reason.

589
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:54,879
Now, if you'll excuse me.

590
01:17:54,904 --> 01:17:56,333
Just one more thing.

591
01:17:56,605 --> 01:18:00,479
Who hired you to draft the
will in the first place?

592
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:02,478
Keep trying, detective.

593
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:08,242
Because guesswork is the only way
you'll get anything out of me.

594
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,219
Surprise, surprise.

595
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:52,704
I don't think I told you.

596
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,226
I don't like surprises

597
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:58,096
except on my birthday.

598
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,640
Could've got yourself killed.

599
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:03,337
Listen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

600
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,881
you move again and the first
bullet goes in your nut sack.

601
01:19:08,778 --> 01:19:10,932
Whoa. I just came
here to talk Kelogg.

602
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:14,939
Put the gun away.

603
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:17,552
Okay.

604
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,890
Start talking.

605
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:30,631
Kelogg.

606
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:37,309
Now where would someone get
a name like Kelogg from?

607
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:38,974
Yeah.

608
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:44,000
I think my mother
was using drugs.

609
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,727
Why did you come to see me?

610
01:19:48,752 --> 01:19:50,589
I go see a lot of people.

611
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:52,075
Don't mean shit.

612
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:55,023
Anyway, your grandmother

613
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,861
had a half a million dollar

614
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:04,904
insurance policy but I'm
sure you know about that.

615
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,600
And what's the problem?

616
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,780
The problem is that everyone

617
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:11,921
who's a beneficiary is
missing except you.

618
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:17,805
The insurance company thinks that's
a little more than a coincidence.

619
01:20:17,913 --> 01:20:19,022
And what about Hannah?

620
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,047
Yeah.

621
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,641
What about Hannah?

622
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,510
The masked man.

623
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:32,048
And I don't mean
the lone ranger.

624
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,794
What do you know about
the interviewer?

625
01:20:38,868 --> 01:20:40,229
The golden elephant?

626
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:43,505
Stop this.

627
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,536
You're not even a cop.

628
01:20:47,577 --> 01:20:48,577
Not anymore.

629
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:53,090
But I know a rat when I see one.

630
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:34,965
Where's the money, bitch?

631
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:35,990
What money?

632
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,893
You've got five seconds.

633
01:21:41,264 --> 01:21:42,761
One, two, three, four.

634
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:48,936
Okay.

635
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:50,905
Where?

636
01:21:50,974 --> 01:21:51,840
Upstairs.

637
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,597
- Where?
- Under the bed.

638
01:21:53,943 --> 01:21:55,253
Upstairs under the bed.

639
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:56,298
Go take it out.

640
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,304
You better be telling
me the truth, bitch.

641
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:06,654
Hey, boss.

642
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:07,913
Did you check it?

643
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,379
Is it all there?

644
01:22:09,525 --> 01:22:10,818
It's all I found.

645
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:12,794
Where's the rest of it?

646
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:13,528
That's it.

647
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:14,529
I swear.

648
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,464
Sweet smell of money.

649
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,646
Nice doing business with you.

650
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:27,285
Have a good day, doll.

651
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,310
Let's go.

652
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:31,138
Here's your keys.

653
01:22:45,862 --> 01:22:47,699
Gavin. You have a visitor.

654
01:22:51,868 --> 01:22:53,637
This man has done no harm,

655
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,363
committed no crime,

656
01:22:57,974 --> 01:22:59,403
and yet his fate lies

657
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:01,643
in your hands.

658
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,869
If you will not talk
to save yourself,

659
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,144
perhaps you will to
save an innocent.

660
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:12,941
Decide quickly.

661
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,310
Do not hesitate.

662
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:21,829
Time's up.

663
01:23:46,255 --> 01:23:47,275
Hungry, Gavin?

664
01:24:07,176 --> 01:24:09,198
You wouldn't even
help a stranger.

665
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:11,977
Would you help a child?

666
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:20,418
She's fresh, innocent.

667
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,294
Why don't you help her?

668
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:31,233
Help her.

669
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:34,426
Please, help me.

670
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,109
Just as we thought.

671
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:51,860
She won't even help a child.

672
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,387
So very disappointing.

673
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:16,978
Still hungry?

674
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:22,850
Go ahead.

675
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:25,787
Take a bite.

676
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,322
She was so sweet.

677
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:41,869
Wasn't she?

678
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,167
Last chance to talk.

679
01:25:53,483 --> 01:25:56,353
You know, you did
this to her, Gavin.

680
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:01,426
How does that make you feel?

681
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:05,316
By not cooperating

682
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:08,029
you have sealed her fate.

683
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:13,664
And now you have also
sealed your fate.

684
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,736
Can you live with that?

685
01:26:26,349 --> 01:26:27,505
Please, help me.

686
01:26:30,386 --> 01:26:31,474
Please, help me.

687
01:26:33,789 --> 01:26:34,877
Please, help me.

688
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,560
Help me.

689
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:40,915
Please, please.

690
01:26:41,096 --> 01:26:41,796
Help me.

691
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:42,797
Help me.

692
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,663
Please, help me.

693
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,878
I want to get out
of here please.

694
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,426
Get me out of here.

695
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:03,561
Please get me out of here.

696
01:27:03,586 --> 01:27:04,529
Please let me out.

697
01:27:04,554 --> 01:27:05,554
Let me out.

698
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:15,791
Hey, Nancy is here.

699
01:27:17,132 --> 01:27:18,132
Talk to her.

700
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:27,042
You okay?

701
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:29,176
Do I look like I'm okay?

702
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:33,043
I just had five guys break in
here and shove guns in my face.

703
01:27:35,318 --> 01:27:38,744
Well, whatever is going
on you know I'm here.

704
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:40,647
Nance, I'm not who

705
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,143
you think I am.

706
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,232
What do you mean by that?

707
01:27:51,167 --> 01:27:53,657
My cousin Gavin stole
$300,000 from our

708
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:57,330
grandmother's house
and we've split it,

709
01:27:57,873 --> 01:28:00,428
but it was supposed
to be a secret.

710
01:28:01,377 --> 01:28:02,377
Our secret.

711
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:05,474
How the fuck did they
know I had money in here?

712
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:07,950
They had keys to my house.

713
01:28:08,618 --> 01:28:10,913
How the fuck did they
get keys to my house?

714
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:15,932
What are we going to do?

715
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:16,957
We?

716
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:18,822
I'm not in this shit.

717
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:20,843
But I just needed
you to help me.

718
01:28:20,997 --> 01:28:23,507
No, I told you I
wasn't getting involved.

719
01:28:23,532 --> 01:28:24,532
I told you.

720
01:28:24,567 --> 01:28:25,399
But we're friends.

721
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,910
No, we're friends, yeah.
But I'm not going

722
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:28,772
to let you fuck up my life.

723
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,147
Nance, like I've never
done anything for you?

724
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:33,261
Like you've never
done shit to me?

725
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,719
You know what I'm talking about.

726
01:28:36,545 --> 01:28:37,989
I never said I was innocent.

727
01:28:38,014 --> 01:28:40,958
Not one time did I ever
say I was innocent.

728
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:42,293
But you know what Hannah?

729
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:44,495
I never put your life in danger.

730
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:49,553
What should I do now?

731
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:53,984
I'm not going to
even answer that.

732
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:38,863
Gavin, are you scared?

733
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,373
I have a letter for you.

734
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:50,867
More bullshit.

735
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:59,651
Gavin, you are not in a
position to respond.

736
01:31:03,259 --> 01:31:05,028
If I were you, I'd listen.

737
01:31:09,532 --> 01:31:12,333
A decision has been made
based on your evaluation.

738
01:31:12,734 --> 01:31:13,822
Within 24 hours,

739
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:16,770
you will die.

740
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:19,505
Why are you looking
at me like that?

741
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:22,577
Peace, Gavin.

742
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:56,872
You got any cigarettes in there?

743
01:31:57,145 --> 01:31:58,982
Your jokes are not funny.

744
01:31:59,215 --> 01:32:01,324
Seeing that your death is near,

745
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,046
a decision was made.

746
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:07,889
A decision?

747
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:09,890
On what?

748
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:13,556
Why don't you fuckers
just kill me already?

749
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:14,828
Huh?

750
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:18,233
Just kill me.

751
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:19,701
Kill me!

752
01:32:22,404 --> 01:32:24,513
Actually, if it were up to me

753
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,746
I'd cut your hands off and
let you bleed to death.

754
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:33,652
Your evaluation is complete.

755
01:33:13,689 --> 01:33:14,689
Hey.

756
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:17,958
She's dead.

757
01:33:19,528 --> 01:33:20,528
She's dead.

758
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:24,631
She's dead.

759
01:33:25,967 --> 01:33:26,967
She's dead.

760
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:04,439
I told you.

761
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:33,721
Move. Vamanos!

762
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:46,475
Hola. Buenas noches.

763
01:34:49,585 --> 01:34:52,090
Whatever you just said would
be great if I spoke Spanish.

764
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,079
Any numbers yet?

765
01:34:58,527 --> 01:34:59,527
No.

766
01:35:00,462 --> 01:35:01,462
Priceless.

767
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:12,129
I like that word.

768
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:13,875
Priceless.

769
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:16,944
Make a wish.

770
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,333
Wishes can't come
true without cash.

771
01:35:27,588 --> 01:35:31,219
But what we're talking about is
worth much, much more than cash.

772
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,930
Yes. I can see it.

773
01:35:47,009 --> 01:35:48,009
Ah, yes.

774
01:35:54,949 --> 01:35:56,173
The day is coming.

775
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:03,831
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

776
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:04,832
Oh my God.

777
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,399
What are you doing here?

778
01:40:07,735 --> 01:40:08,735
I don't know.

779
01:40:14,309 --> 01:40:16,536
If both of us are here
then what about...?

780
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:20,347
I hope not.

781
01:40:22,818 --> 01:40:24,478
My other sister is
not here, right?

782
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:28,355
Talk to me.

783
01:40:28,957 --> 01:40:29,957
Come on!

784
01:40:31,193 --> 01:40:32,962
Where's my goddamn sister?

785
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,820
If it wasn't for Blake
I'd be dead right now.

786
01:40:49,845 --> 01:40:51,673
Just the way you
wanted it, right?

787
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:54,605
- I'm sorry, momma.
- Shut the fuck up.

788
01:40:55,149 --> 01:40:56,638
You tried killing
your own mother.

789
01:40:56,851 --> 01:40:57,652
I'm sorry, mom.

790
01:40:57,653 --> 01:40:59,889
But growing up in your
house was bullshit.

791
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:02,621
I mean every fucking month
you had a new boyfriend.

792
01:41:03,391 --> 01:41:05,364
You even fucked my boyfriend.

793
01:41:06,728 --> 01:41:09,627
And then when he started bragging
about it at school that was it.

794
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:14,156
And fuck Mexico.

795
01:41:16,037 --> 01:41:18,214
I wanted to kill you right then.

796
01:41:20,341 --> 01:41:23,145
Well, I guess we just
hate each other, don't we?

797
01:41:23,779 --> 01:41:25,604
But what I want to know
is who killed grandma?

798
01:41:33,121 --> 01:41:34,121
I did.

799
01:41:35,791 --> 01:41:38,358
She was sick.
She was ill.

800
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:41,338
And she wanted to die
and I took care of it.

801
01:41:41,363 --> 01:41:42,792
You took care of it?

802
01:41:43,131 --> 01:41:45,240
You both treated her like shit.

803
01:41:45,801 --> 01:41:49,413
And when I found out what you did,
even though you're my goddamn kids

804
01:41:49,438 --> 01:41:51,411
I knew I had to get you back.

805
01:41:52,373 --> 01:41:54,369
And that's why I
took you to Mexico.

806
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:58,316
And when you found out about it,
you tried to flip it around.

807
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,087
Payback is a motherfucker.

808
01:42:09,925 --> 01:42:11,125
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

809
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:15,004
All right, please stop.

810
01:42:15,029 --> 01:42:16,253
Please, oh my God.

811
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,832
Please!

812
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:19,099
Oh my God.
Stop.

813
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:20,665
Listen, get off of him.

814
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:21,969
Please.

815
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:32,365
No. Oh my God.

816
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:36,102
No, no, no, no.

817
01:42:37,219 --> 01:42:38,719
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

818
01:42:39,887 --> 01:42:40,887
No.

819
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,917
Take off that mask
you motherfucker.

820
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:37,003
Ready to pay?

821
01:44:43,511 --> 01:44:47,363
Did you really think you were
going to get away Hannah?

822
01:46:17,338 --> 01:46:18,338
Billy.
