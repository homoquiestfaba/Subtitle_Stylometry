1
00:00:09,776 --> 00:01:13,640

00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,223
Why? Because he's crazy.

She won't pull her fingernails on my foot.

38
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,094
It's to which movie too fucking crazy.

39
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,530
A small thing man made over

40
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,433
which city shall be eaten
is the witch in the shower. I need money.

41
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,901
I don't give a fuck what it is.

42
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,469
No doubt whether that money

00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,440
it will create a fucking mortgage
on socialize with shit.

44
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,910

Oh, wait a minute, he might not be
smoking, Bill, the way it goes.

48
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,291
People say the way
Saddam Hussein is going to make

49
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:24,130
a fucking fuck it, I'll put him now,
but I don't want to see what happen.

50
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,832
Fucking Dick is greedy.

51
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,602
A more strong look like the little balls

52
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,705
in the back of the socks,
the little things fucking that.

53
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,209
I had a fucking dream

54
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,145
throwing my dick.

55
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,050
You understand you can understand

56
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,690
me a yo yo, this is my world,
this is my world.

57
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,626
I went down there by myself
one night, right?

58
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,498
This kid told me to go down here
and he said it will be all good.

59
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,199
He was like, you know, go down there.

60
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,036
This is the projects,
but you'll be safe, you know?

61
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,205
And I'm like, OK, well, I'm like,
you know what I'm saying?

62
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,309
But, you know, I'm a cool white kid,
you know what I mean? So.

63
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,111
So I figured, you know,
he said you would be.

64
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,581
So I went down there
and he said the drugs were free.

65
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:16,816
You know what I mean?

66
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,084
I didn't have to pay anything.

67
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,820
So I'm thinking I'll go down there, free
drugs, whatever.

68
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,487
You know what I'm saying?

69
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,190
But they said they said
she was really ugly.

70
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,626
So you can't look
at it for too long. Right.

71
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,597
So I was looking at it, you know, saying
I'm only trying to look at it,

72
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,133
but I was like, what? By a mirror
and try to you know what I'm saying?

73
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,936
See the reflection or whatever.

74
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,372
And I guess I was like, I don't know.

75
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,443
I was sitting there for a minute
and I slipped something into my drink,

76
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,145
I guess, or something.

77
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,082
And I took it. I drank some

78
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,918
stuff about what
the fuck was some hot water?

79
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,722
I drank some hot water, you know, and.

80
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,561
I don't. Yeah, of course.

81
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,662
You're not listening.

82
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,329
I'm telling you.

83
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,398
But she's pretty.

84
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,266
At 10 million dollars.

85
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,969
But that's the way I look at A.M.

86
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,407
straight up. And we're not playing
all your niggers.

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,509
We're going to have some

88
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,914
street like dead.

89
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,086
Yo, check it. This is
Salem, Massachusetts.

90
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,390
You know the places
where the witches are from.

91
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,191
That's me, Will.

92
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,461
The shortI with the pink
hair is wave girl, the skinny guy with

93
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,265
the dreads is shaggy
short little angry boy is muzzled

94
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,769
in the thick chickies meal.

95
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,875
Oh, and she has a dog named Pug. Dog.

96
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,814
We all grew up around the way in a town
near Salem called Framingham

97
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,151
Framingham's, just like any other hick
town in the suburbs.

98
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,120
We've all known each other
since kindergarten.

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,290
Through the years, we stayed tight.
Even though we're all so different.

100
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,825
We're still friends.

101
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,361
There's not a whole lot
to do in Framingham.

102
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,596
As you can see, but lately, other

103
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,299
lives in this huge town
have been less than fulfilling.

104
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,601
Until I read about the hip hop, which.

105
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:29,182
How many? The state you called last week,
small enterprises.

106
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,285
All right, all right, I'll tell hello.
All right. Know I'm sorry.

107
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,354
We had that story last week
and you said, I choose Ortego.

108
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,931
So do we have this morning?

109
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,966
What's going on? What's new? OK.

110
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,968
All right, I'll ask Betty called again.

111
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,270
He has a picture of a cat
that gave birth to it off his picture.

112
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,874
That's nothing. I'm sick of those people.
What about you, Mr. and Mrs. Stip Rickon?

113
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:59,011
They said aliens landed on the roof
and they say they're the prophets.

114
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,981
These same people,
they have nothing to say.

115
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,449
Sarah, her story.

116
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,385
A scientist at Manhattan Labs
claims that sperm

117
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,121
is now proven to be
the fountain of heroes when it boring.

118
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,224
This is nothing.

119
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,626
Is this all women?
Is this all you have for me this morning?

120
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,329
I want to tell you something.

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,998
Do you see that man over there, Mr. Crump?

122
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,802
He is the reason that you were sitting
in those chairs that your butts are

123
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,237
in those chairs right now, OK?

124
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,441
And the reason I am sitting in this chair
is because I know

125
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,577
how to get a great story.
Do you think I just came here.

126
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,714
I sought the story out.
I found it. Gosh, yeah.

127
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,350
This is Mr. Crump to get more serious.

128
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,719
Hey, no screwing around. Good stuff.

129
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,688
Not tomorrow. Today.

130
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:47,059
Now, Covid never ceased to be a.

131
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,162
We're looking for this bitch,
this fucking hip hop witch bitch.

132
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,233
The bitch, the bitch got little she she,

going to kill this bitch when we catch up.

137
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,716
I'm on the hunt for this bitch right now.

138
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,586
So of course, it's
not that we're going to kill this bitch.

139
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,720
We're going to kill this bitch.

140
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,924
I'm a I'm a blow this bitch to planet
Rasim. I don't give a fuck.

142
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,199
We try to think bubble
that we're no trouble there.

143
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,436
Me and my friend, we on the road
like we tumble, they're watching money

144
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,573
because everybody's hustling to block it.

145
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,443
We'll keep coming. Coming. Medium.

146
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:45,151
Everybody said everything is wonderful
now that I'm here, a girlfriend

147
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,020
who fell out of their place
with all of the crazy me ,

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,196
OK, I heard she's a sister. Yes,
she is. So which way?

151
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,632
Straight ahead. She's

152
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,367
See you later. Let's OK.

153
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,470
The problem is whether your boy

154
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,607
if you're making money to me,
is all hustlin soon to be

155
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,343
in a rock to the muscle and the HP.

156
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,678
What the government is

157
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,750
going to have to do

158
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,519
is use Josephine has been

159
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:24,423
I've heard wonderful things
about you just .

160
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,492
I received a fax on you this morning, Mr.

161
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,961
Washington. Yes.

162
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,063
Didi, is that short for a Deandra?

163
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,499
Denise? No, just cute.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,135
I was also perusing
your file this morning,

165
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,206
and I had a couple of questions
on two different issues.

166
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,476
I noticed that you previously

167
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,712
worked for six months
for our other location on 44th.

168
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,449
And then you switched over to the 80
the street location.

169
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,619
I can explain all of that.

170
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,723
Basically, I worked for a lot of men and
there was some sexual harassment involved.

171
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,994
And just to keep it under wraps,
I told them I'd like to be transferred.

172
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,396
And my girl works at the front desk.

173
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,731
She's a receptionist. And she told me
there was an opening over here.

174
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,466
There was a sister doing thing.

175
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,503
So I told her basically I told my boss
that I wanted to be transferred here,

176
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,172
you know, sisters together
doing it, you know, and.

177
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,343
Well, you can be assured
that I won't be coming on to you, correct?

178
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,647
Well, I should let you know what
your job responsibilities will be here

179
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,383
at Trump Enterprises.
You will be answering to me.

180
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,287
And every morning there's certain things
that must be in place.

181
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,357
You are in charge of the mail room
faxes in open view.

182
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,261
And like my Mimos suite on my desk,

You got that duty. All right.

185
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,838
Are you back in your old job?

186
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:55,181
I will never be up.

187
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,851
So you'll check it out.

188
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:04,356

We're going to sit around,
let the street down, take over.

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,102

We got it. We got to come with sun.
That ain't been done before.

196
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,409
A lot of this shit out

197
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,978
We're focus now for the women
we're focusing on, for the niggas,

00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,606
I'm going to talk about that.

217
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,409
A lot of people are saying that.

218
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,545
Different really happening right now.

219
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,514
We are on the slopes, well, you got a tap.

220
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,550
I really did get a tap

221
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,853
not that he's saying things like that.

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,358
They're going to keep
putting it in my hair, pulling out a hole.

223
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,063
This is Isabelle
Calzado for hip hop watch TV.

224
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:55,167
We're on our way right now to the Slim
Shady studios, where Eminem and Spliff

225
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,871
are bolted themselves inside
for fear of being attacked by the hip hop,

226
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,740
which lets see what's going on.

227
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,547
They're not allowing me inside.

228
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:12,718
Only a cameraman has been allowed access
for fear, this reporter, a female,

229
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:19,358
may be the hip hop, which in disguise
a wish of God is God then thwe princess.

230
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,728
Oh, just no fucking women. Oh, magic.

231
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,468
That song is about the winds.

232
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,704
Yeah, he's pretty.

233
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:37,042
I drink some hot water sprite, drink
some hot water, and it has some exiting.

234
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,645
Now, I didn't know you had to exit it.

235
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,348
You know, man, I was seeing it soon.

236
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,682
And then all of a sudden I start feeling

237
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,384
this really weird feeling,
you know what I'm saying?

238
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,788
And my eyes start coming out of my,
you know, like really fucked up.

239
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,791
Are you following me?
I'm following you at all on the train.

240
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,093
All right. Listen,

241
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,863
this is kind of a touchy subject,
but OK, I'm going to call you back.

242
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,633
And I'm a punchline to one to five inches

243
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,603
snow despite my song.

244
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,206
You know what I mean? Come on. Yeah.

245
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,611
Anyways, I took I took the took the
ex and she started laughing.

246
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,683
She was laughing at the beginning,
but I don't know.

247
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,252
She was really laughing
and looked like she was laughing at me.

248
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,155
It sounded like she was
laughing at me. But I did sound

249
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,961
like a horse like Impey, OK?

250
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,564
And she's laughing at me and I'm crying

251
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:36,168
and I'm trying to figure out what's going
on, because my puke was like this big.

252
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,269
I looked in the mirror.

253
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,006
My pupils, you my pupils
were like this. Yeah.

254
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:46,779
Yeah. Last year I had ASHRAE pupils
from drinking the hot-blooded allowed

255
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,883
to walk out the side of your bucket
and not your face. Now

256
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,121
phosphenes just Southtown don't sweat

257
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,827
know that can't walk straight over
crossover switch over change.

258
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,764
Well I don't so I sent them and

259
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,901
I summon me a couple yo.

260
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,774
The real shit about to go down
right now, I feeling it.

261
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,711
I'm all ears, my brother,

262
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,013
you know, my money's going
just like the street down, man.

263
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,247
I want to know, you know what I'm saying?

264
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,416
What we have to do to try to get on,
you know what I'm saying,

265
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,852
and make things happen for us
in this company right here.

266
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,722
My my my audience is hot.
You know what I'm saying?

267
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:30,923
All we want to do is, you know,

268
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,893
we just want to know the secret
to selling all ammunition, some secrets.

269
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:35,861
Simple, my brother.

270
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:36,762
I rule the streets.

271
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,231
Yeosu, if you want to get on,
you got to put me on.

272
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,600
Well, I have no problem with that.

273
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,602
Would you ask him for half? You

274
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:51,276
had half. You know what half means
half of your artists, half of you,

275
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,980
half of your production company,
half of the distribution rights,

276
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:59,084
half of the merchandizing rights,
the studio, everything. Half.

277
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:07,526
I do the money. I'll
be there all the time.

278
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,963
When you see us greased up black, which.

279
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,466
Yeah, well I might them. No, I get

280
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,536
instead of black.

281
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,437
Oh, the next story.

282
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,240
Yeah, I know. You know
there's the black bridge.

283
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,577
OK, the black with ten million dollars
for the capture of black,

284
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:30,716
which is victimizing rappers
from the record label Gastrique.

285
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,586
Dunno, what's the street done
the best trying to grab me.

286
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,191
It's definitely like, you know, me
and I had to pull out and pop off on

287
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,661
and you know, I mean, you're black,
which is no such thing as with no shit.

288
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,130
So why are they offering ten
million dollars if there's no such thing?

289
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,733
Let's figure it out,
guys. It's a publicity stunt.

290
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,469
I've been tracking this
for about three weeks now.

291
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,840
Each and every week there's more
claims of witches attacking his artist.

292
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,975
And every week record sales go up.

293
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,644
There's no such thing as witches.

294
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,712
How are we going to bring them
a wish to get ten million dollars?

295
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,915
We threaten to go to the press with them.

296
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,550
We can bust them. We can get ten million.

297
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,453
Do you want to blackmail
some record industry?

298
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,623
Is that what you're saying? Uh, yeah.

299
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,325
How are we going to get to New York?

300
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,595
I mean, we're in Salem
and it's a mighty long way.

301
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,898
Still fuckin car.

302
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,233
That's what we'll do.

303
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,002
Oh, OK. Gambino, fuck you.

304
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,339
No, I don't think so. No,
I don't think so. That's bad karma, dude.

305
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,942
That's bad, bad, bad karma. Oh, yeah.

306
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,743
You're the cop. That's bad.

307
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,379
When we get the money,
we just give the car back. That's OK.

308
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,259
Great house. Crime, it's

309
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,262
everywhere in our art, on our streets.

310
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,930
There's no escaping it.

311
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,266
And the hip hop,
which is just another section of it,

312
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,903
is no such thing
as which is, you know, the black,

313
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,471
which I don't know too much about.

314
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,374
The black wish to tell you
so much about the black race. But

315
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,444
we have a witch that's not black so much.

316
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:09,448
But she comes from a black cat book store
and she's with us now.

317
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,418
She's the best tarot reader, knows more
about the craft than most people in town

318
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:14,887
know the way it goes.

319
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:21,160
People say the way Saddam made his way
west and beat his way out.

320
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:33,539
Tell. We're going to face

321
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,807
of the green hair.

322
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,047
Big feet, like 20 feet.

323
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,386
Disgusting shit, you know,
I see this snack.

324
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,031
And we we consulted for hip hop on TV.

325
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,666
I'm on the scene right now with Baucau

326
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,869
rapper Sevior, who's having many,
many problems with the which of course,

327
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,438
Spanish viewers on retaining,
which is one of them, is going to

328
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,442
make him relax. So.

329
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,810
All right. We Adobe.

330
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,615
Good it's good to of reference firsthand

331
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,951
to step off the light.

332
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:24,122
And, you know, it's like you
maybe should don't even make no sense.

333
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,792
I ain't never seen shit
like that in my life.

334
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,661
And she was pretty big.

335
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,396
She looked like a big

336
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,100
a big green, green and black,
you know, Sasquatch or some shit.

337
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,002
And it starts swinging at me.

338
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,638
Damn damn near. Pushed my feet
back and all that.

339
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,507
Well, you can't let me forget.

340
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:47,079
La la la la la la la la. Ha ha ha.

341
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,517
So anyways, she goes to put
a finger up my ass, right.

342
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,954
And I'm kind of twitching and shit.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

343
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,456
I'm just like bugging out,
you know what I'm saying?

344
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,857
My eyes are coming out of my ears.

345
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,093
The high blood is like spilled
all over the fucking place.

346
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,129
And I'm trying to I'm trying to run
while she got a finger

347
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,598
like, you know, I'm saying
starting to go up my ass.

348
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,568
And I looked down
and I had no fucking pass on.

349
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,271
You know what I'm saying
is being on these deep notes

350
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,208
from Miles Davis, like, yo, man,
it's like, well, we knew we had

351
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,745
to cut those same because, you know,
because all that crazy shit knows him.

352
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,247
I don't know, man.
I really get a good look now, man.

353
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,750
I just feel like there's
a whole bunch of madness, man.

354
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,886
I got a body and I was
like, sometimes, you know, me

355
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,022
pieces come on by cells.

356
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,358
Adobe went downstairs one morning.
I was saying, I know all equipment.

357
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,596
They said, no, this terrorism started
playing all different types of bees back.

358
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,132
The back side is crazy.

359
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,435
Now the fuck is going
on. That they might get mad.

360
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,303
And I'm talking about it right

361
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:49,107
now, or, you know,
this is kind of scary on the table.

362
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,877
I said Shinoda makes magnetizing.

363
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,813
It's hitting the sit
now low on the on the right notes.

364
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:59,551
And I'll be having to look around
these calls for me for me to move in

365
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,955
with this man here, Stephen King,
this prodigy mob deep.

366
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:06,725
They don't fuck with the hip hop, which

367
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,128
you just cannot find out
about a real good plan.

368
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,537
Yeah. Yeah. Would be

369
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,441
regrows temp job.

370
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,348
Courtyard sustained.

371
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,752
Would you be? Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,656
Price went from one million to two.

373
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,593
Everybody is, the government said,
like those witches from Eastwick,

374
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,362
it ain't a secret to grandma.

375
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,565
I speak with Peter Choules
niggers back in my day life, bullet proof

376
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,601
riches out the blue will come around
and put a hold upon the light

377
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,769
for any rapid Ashleigh.

378
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,137
So stop sleeping.

379
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,606
Hello. I don't know.

380
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,110
Nagin was trying to get down
before they can.

381
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,077
Said it was right.

382
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,011
I'll bring it to light.

383
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,581
Either we fabricio get the job
and we could split the cheder

384
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,116
or separate us on whatever.

385
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,283
As long as I live forever

386
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,054
with them, I can't let you always get tear
flesh and rip open your bare chest.

387
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,724
We need that so you better wise up
quick before it's too late for y'all

388
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,925
to recognize this shit.

389
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,094
Are you afraid of the dark?

390
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,196
Okay. What about the wisdom of the club?

391
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,600
If you tell me to
let me see the madness for themselves

392
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,670
and the witches, I put my mind to
that or any kind of seatings.

393
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,440
You know, I don't believe in things.

394
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,642
And you know what has been done
to you, to you or me.

395
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,412
But how are you going to go against
say you can't see you?

396
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,648
Show me the drama, never see.
Still like the belly of the beast,

397
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,117
reminiscent of fellow rappers
that went beneath.

398
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,721
I mean, these streets, rappers from those
that went to heaven, those that went down

399
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,891
the soul rail is just a lesson that.

400
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,562
All right. All right,
so we're here now with the fucking gift.

401
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,664
We're going to find out who's responsible.

402
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,266
Yeah, we're going to find the street

403
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,368
on, you know, the guy
I showed you in the magazine

404
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,637
going to find him,
we're going to bust him. Yeah.

405
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,872
So why don't we find these guys?

406
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,607
Get them on tape.

407
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,843
And then we can,
like, blackmail them or something.

408
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:10,382
Here we go. Boy, I got to walk the dog
for the dread of dread.

409
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,784
Show us the way.

410
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,053
Want to show us the way?

411
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,222
Show us away. Show.

412
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,560
Let's start with.

413
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,965
Since the attack, vitamin C.

414
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,869
Oh, one hundred and fifty
thousand units split up,

415
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:35,407
120000 units hell raiser up
two hundred thousand units.

416
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,409
Yeah, that's straight up.

417
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,211
I'm looking at the numbers right now, man.

418
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,780
This week, SoundScan,
all it has since the attack.

419
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,417
The word on the street
you fucking with big

420
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:48,386
Z like you trying to double do yo yo dumb.

421
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,055
I'll put it to you like this.

422
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,691
You can you're going to let that nigga
z fuck with your shit.

423
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,260
You tell me I've got your back.

424
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,029
I know what's up. I rules these streets.

425
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:11,109
Just Covid Covid these Covid.

426
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:16,314
Just Covid you crazy?

427
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,152
Boy, tough line,
don't get no better than that.

428
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,122
Who's better than me?

429
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,791
Like he did 10 million bucks.

430
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,466
Key to. I mean. Yeah,

431
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,935
we're going to keep an eye on.

432
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,539
What's going on.

433
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:45,877
Twice, staff like James Bond,
the undisputed world champion, made mad.

434
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:49,548
Hi, it's Johnny Bananas
right here. Hangmen three.

435
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,552
I still just two times over
and Egmond through it.

436
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,687
Jesus made me Rosemary's Baby.

437
00:25:55,687 --> 00:26:01,593
I Qianlong like a long black fuckin
like a long black trenchcoat type shit.

438
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:06,264
I look more like some type of um,
some type of black like you're

439
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:10,035
your bitches Bostich like the fucking arm
Shiao like some kind of judge,

440
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:13,505
like the black Lusane saying that
we've been waiting already Benzino for M..

441
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:15,073
I think she snatched Muchea.

442
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,977
She'd run wild out to small
fuck a man up here right now as we speak.

443
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,279
I don't even know if this woman

444
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,717
on the economy I think you made me
think is going to jump off.

445
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,920
I don't trust yo,
we made men up bloody be yo.

446
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,190
I actually just stay away
from that fucking.

447
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,962
Which really speaks to I mean, the way
in which you're trying to find rape.

448
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,763
Benzino now she's crazy.

449
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,932
Think she snatched him
up. Don't get him back.

450
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,669
If you're watching the dog coming to get
you, you'll be coming to get you.

451
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:53,144
Rob Van Winkle, otherwise
known as Vanilla Ice.

452
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,947
Tell you what man
is, which is got me going crazy.

453
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,850
You know, she came to me
at one of my shows.

454
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,453
I say ice cores.

455
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,923
In this trench coat
and she like, opened up her

456
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,060
trench coat and she was butt
naked in there, I was like.

457
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,395
She followed the show around

458
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:14,299
and it was crazy, man, I didn't even know
we were all talking about it.

459
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,767
It was like, man,
check out this beautiful chick.

460
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,702
And then she wrote
some stuff in the mirror,

461
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,105
some kind of satanic message
or something in the mirror.

462
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,173
Being that my birthday's on Halloween,

463
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,443
you know, I thought maybe it had something
to do with that, because, you know,

464
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:30,715
Hallow's Eve is like the biggest evil
holiday of the year for these people.

465
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,418
And then it wasn't until later that
I learned that she was like the witch man.

466
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,520
And I was like, whoa,
I still have nightmares.

467
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,689
I mean, this is no joke, man. Nightmares.

468
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,859
You know, I just got to tell everybody,
watch out for the hip hop witch.

469
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:46,698
But she could be this fine chick and then
completely flip the script and be Satan.

470
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,705
Oh, I miss Josephine.

471
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,774
I did. How are you?

472
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,909
A couple of quarters together
for everybody, you need anything?

473
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,012
Oh, no, just waiting for me
to bring my Caesar salad.

474
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,683
I have been doing something
that I probably shouldn't have been doing,

475
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,620
but it was in the interests of Premiere
cashier. OK, OK.

476
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,454
I remember when I first

477
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,290
started with the company, you told me
if I had any interesting stories

478
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,625
to come to you with them, right?

479
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,827
Yeah. Well, I have one ready.

480
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,664
There's this hip hop, which it's
been attacking these rappers, supposedly.

481
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,901
All right. Supposedly these rappers,
they've all been on television

482
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,602
talking about they've been attacked

483
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,339
by this hip hop, which people like Priz,
this pop star, vitamin C.

484
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:29,708
This guy, Eminem.

485
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:33,511
The point is, they've been saying they've
been attacked, but they really haven't.

486
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,148
What I have concluded
to bring the record Silvercup.

487
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,086
Hip hop, which hip hop, which.

488
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,022
So just a story about a hip hop,
which is a story

489
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,625
about bringing these people out,
it's a lot like, come on, you think that

490
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,028
I would be interested in such crap?

491
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,165
You know, I thought Enterprises
was interested in that stories.

492
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,567
I could be the reporter.

493
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,468
It could be big.

494
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,104
I know it. It could be really big
for us, which they.

495
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,241
Vitamin C, vitamin C sold
two million copies.

496
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,178
She's some Pasdaran
spending far too much time reading about

497
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:11,750
doing your job properly. Not interested.

498
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,188
Ray Benzino was the main man

499
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,425
with my nick, is he being born, sir?

500
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,362
I'm saying all I know is right.

501
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm up in the projects and shit.

502
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,971
No, I'm saying it fucking all of a sudden
I see this fucking big light.

503
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,939
I don't know what the fuck it was.

504
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,208
Me and Vum talking to some bitches.

505
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,145
The next thing you know,
a big fucking green light is some shit.

506
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,214
And then I was like,
damn, what the fuck is that? And

507
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,517
it was some smoke, man.

508
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,985
I just killed yardman.

509
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,387
We jet. It goes some crazy shit, man.

510
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:02,066
Stackup, Miss Washington,
welcome to Trump Enterprise.

511
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,270
I don't care if it's Trump Enterprises,
all right, don't touch my ass.

512
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,571
I will all this motherfucker.

513
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,607
OK, look, we have a lot of cross country,

514
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,677
Eric Trump, and you definitely have
a lot of potential.

515
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,145
Look at Mr Josefin.

516
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,481
I don't really care about Miss Josephine.

517
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,882
Mr. Trump. All right.

518
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,085
My butt is off limits. OK,
so I'd appreciate it if you. OK, yourself.

519
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,822
OK, you just think about it.

520
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,824
There's nothing to think about.

521
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,826
You want to go on the company.

522
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,261
Like I said, there's
a lot of growth potential.

523
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,529
Have a lot of potential yourself.

524
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:34,365
My door's always open. But the country.

525
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,737
Are we still on for tonight for dinner?

526
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,074
And after dinner, fix the problem.

527
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:48,746
Madeleine bought tickets for the kids
the other day for this hip hop concert.

528
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,749
Look, this hip hop thing.

529
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:57,522
It's on all the TVs, all the newspapers,
all the radio stations.

530
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,624
My son talks about it.

531
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,560
Do we have anything,
any storylines whatsoever?

532
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,365
I think I'll be able to find something,

533
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,601
but to bring, you know.

534
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,704
Well, you have a good night, OK?

535
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,073
O'clock in the morning can.

536
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,143
Up which project,

537
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,147
you know, and she tried to stick
a finger up my eyes.

538
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:30,588
Oh, yeah, well, she tried to stick her
finger up my ass, that's my word.

539
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,925
You'll be OK. That's my fucking word.

540
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,060
She tried to stick her finger up my ass.

541
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,763
Did she get it in? Nah, she tried.

542
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,032
But I was like, yo yo bug in your book.

543
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,067
And then the fingers
were like six feet long.

544
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,704
Oh, yes. And basketball players?

545
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,807
Yeah. Basketball fingers? Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,212
This hip hop thing is dicks.

547
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,156
Yeah, I don't think I caught the bits
to be just crazy.

548
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,360
I was I was, you know, that green had

549
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:15,600
big feet, like 20 feet

550
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,603
are disgusting shit.

551
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,539
You don't want to see this nasty night.

552
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,542
Supermodel Beverly
Peel is afraid for her life.

553
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,643
It is yet another

554
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:29,447
alleged attack of the hip hop
which chased me down the stairs to fight.

555
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,382
The fire escapes to the hotel.

556
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,216
Yeah, the hotel.

557
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,686
And then she caught me
and I was fucking freaking out

558
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,688
because you know the show tonight
and I don't know what to do.

559
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,289
I'm like, freaking out.
She could be anywhere.

560
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,458
I see a big humongous seven foot shadows.

561
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,898
Either way, I'm begging
you cannot go near, this is dangerous,

562
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:49,567
you should pull out a machete on you
or something of this way and stay.

563
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,804
Oh, man. One that came
in the studio or the sports.

564
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:57,041
And I was I was shown

565
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,612
with a girl chip then,
which came up in that show,

566
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,084
which came to me for a month or so.

567
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,252
But did you know?

568
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,589
Right. Oh, good.

569
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,825
I keep that in. I jumped out.

570
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,727
I let the dogs out from the back.

571
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,996
That's the only way I got away.

572
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,866
You look down your eyes,
all you see is just character sports.

573
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:27,872
And the politicians
being brought in to these

574
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:32,310
all big cities are posh
nitwits up is like it.

575
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,880
Covid, like I say, 45 percent a city.

576
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,282
I used to data. Oh, shit.

577
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:42,453
Like banking mall
for anyone to go down the mountain.

578
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,789
You know what I'm saying?
Go in the woods. Me.

579
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:48,760
I used to have a campfire
banging his door.

580
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,829
It make lights. Yose,
you know how to do my shit.

581
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,132
She's nice, though. She used to be nice.

582
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,035
I'm doing after she broke up with me,
she just flipped out

583
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,736
and just started killing.

584
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,271
Yeah, she just started killing people.

585
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:04,442
People be misunderstood thinking a witch
going to have a bump on her nose.

586
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,846
This woman is beautiful, blond
hair, blue. Word is more.

587
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,050
When this reporter asked the outsiders
why they were being targeted,

588
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,018
they had this conspiracy theory.

589
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:18,756
It refreshes hip hop group in Brick City,
commercial emcees.

590
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,425
They got a lot of protection and stuff.

591
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:23,795
They know they can get to us
and they don't want us to get on.

592
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:25,296
She looked good as hell.

593
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,933
Just stay away from
she got a big ass outfit. Which dope.

594
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:33,004
If you see that, which runs right?

595
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:56,461
Stay away from. The
outsiders came, it's easy to see

596
00:34:56,994 --> 00:35:01,132
you just came out
and they went from 500000

597
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,235
to a fucking million copies
in all of these people.

598
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,173
More on the news about this
freak in hip hop, which is coming.

599
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,510
All of them are what, record company?

600
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,614
Uh huh. With Mr. Big Z.

601
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,683
Z fucking permits.

602
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,920
Have you heard of a hip hop witch
project? This is shit.

603
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,822
I got to get to the outsiders.

604
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,358
We're not talking about God.

605
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,393
So what's up? Come on, man.

606
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,329
We explain all we know about the way

607
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,266
she's come to the attacks by the hip hop,
which have escalated

608
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,769
not only targeting rappers,
but everyday people in the street.

609
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,273
I just seen them, which came
and I ran as fast as I could.

610
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,811
I got the wind behind my back
and grabbed me by my feet after feet.

611
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,448
Don't fail me now. Black,
which is just a phenomenon

612
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,250
throughout the 80s.

613
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,721
I mean, it seems like an urban myth,
but in fact, I know she's black.

614
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:00,491
I heard she's got Stevie Wonder braids.

615
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,968
Are you doing here
my side of the deal, OK?

616
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,337
I got my in Covid, everything's good.

617
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,640
My people are in place.
We we're all set to go. Yeah.

618
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,976
All right. So I got the deal and everybody
everybody is redhill.

619
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,045
One lady messenger.

620
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,780
Everybody is ready, you know.

621
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,715
And you know, it's all going now.

622
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,751
We're just waiting on you
to make your move.

623
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,854
You know what I'm saying?
The street on his time is up.

624
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,222
OK, Mandy Brady. All right.

625
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,858
So we move to the next step
now. All right. OK.

626
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,459
Just like we talked about.

627
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,328
All right. Streetdance going down.

628
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,564
Yeah. Next up, baby.

629
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,066

630
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,536
And even the next pit
going down. All right. All right. Knee.

631
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,548
Thanks, everyone, everyone.

632
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,685
I would like you to meet
someone very special.

633
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,821
I decided to hire a new trainee
and her name is.

634
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,892
Everyone was in shock.

635
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,530
I know it's your first day and all, but.

636
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:17,201
Some ideas you wanted to share
just to throw out some breaking news.

637
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,603
I want you to feel free.

638
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,073
Well, I was working on something
where at my complex where I live.

639
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,449
She's got three new kitchen.

00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:56,340
Which, Jenny? Yes.

Good job. No man.

645
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,959
No man, I was walking down the street.

646
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,495
Take a time, baby. Take your time

647
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:18,829
walking out, because I don't know.

648
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,364
I can't I don't believe in that shit.

649
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,699
Oh, man. Running man.

650
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,535
Pretty may calm down. I calm down.

651
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,273
Long as braids that braid cornrows.

652
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,510
Worse, she had a mic in the hand

653
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,113

654
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,351

Stick, man. A hippies jumped on the broom.

656
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:49,327
Well, I just stopped running
and she starts chasing me, man.

659
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,339
Stay away from the hip hop,
which muthafuckas.

660
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,079
Is not like this overdose.

661
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,182
So yo, it's coming out, the studio set up.

662
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,784
Oh, no. It's it's messy, crazy.

663
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,320
She tried to she tried this.

664
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,689
You know, she really just put it on me.

665
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,257
She's strong. I mean it.

666
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,527
So she said the to me meant

667
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,331
she said the bitch did grab me
the fuck up, break my shit. I got rocks.

668
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,201
She told me if I take these shits
out, that's my head straight.

669
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,572
Well, your mother fucking jokes, you
trying to get the hot motherfucking spin,

670
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,842
you yo pick up to Missy,
but it's the switch going around, yo

671
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,445
watch out, which is crazy.

672
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,247
She's real crazy.

673
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,283
Miss Josephine, if you don't mind, I'd
like to speak to you for just a second.

674
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,486
Sure have, Snoop.

675
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:58,863
You know, I deserved that promotion
that you just gave, Kitty, as a trainee.

676
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,533
I've been working my butt off for you,
and I haven't asked for anything.

677
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,835
I just kind of figured
when this promotion came up

678
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,471
that I would get in
and now you're going to give it to her.

679
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:10,074
Well, can I say I know
you must be upset about it?

680
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,943
No, I know it's not even that I'm upset.
I'm really hurt.

681
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,646
When I first got here,
I mean, we were sisters doing it together.

682
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,648
No kidding. Just a stupid couple, Kitty.

683
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,284
This has nothing to do
about being sisters.

684
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,919
This is business.

685
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,820
And I have you know that

686
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,624
I had her résumé on file for seven months
before you walked in the door.

687
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:32,763
Personally, I think that maybe she was
more qualified for the position than you.

688
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,600
I think, Kitty, more
qualified than me. Look,

689
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,070
there might be something else
opening up soon.

690
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,441
Whatever I want anything else.
I deserve that position. All right.

691
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,611
And just you just keep doing
what you do, right? OK.

692
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,881
Thank you very much, Mr..

693
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:59,690
Prize winner, I thank you. Yeah.

694
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,962
Which at the one everyone.

695
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,766
What is she saying it was rude of us.

696
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,471
Describe for me if you indeed.

697
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:20,277
Tokyo was attacked,
remember the way men would like to ask you

698
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:27,585
why, why, why, why, why not?

699
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,490
This is coming your way to me,

700
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,927
getting me up right now on the plane.

701
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,698
And I just can't can't be a session.

702
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,970
Now, right now, I'm leaving,
I thought you told me to come down here

703
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,139
because you're doing a story
and you wanted me to come down here.

704
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,310
Why don't you go write this?

705
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,412
But I don't understand what he's saying.

706
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:59,450
And you tell me about D.B.

707
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,620
Washington, the witch story
with the rapper's.

708
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,856
How did she get hold of it?

709
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,325
Isn't that Miss Josephine?

710
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:28,145
She put this. Dan?

711
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,582
The fucking risk is stupid.

712
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,451
The bitch got my motherfucking trucks.

713
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,720
The fucking hip hop, which bitch, son?

714
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,723
No, you got Moshin.
This is the fucking last fucking throw.

715
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,794
This bitch got my fucking whipped
son. Oh, so hula.

716
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,134
Try this, the slogan

717
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:53,871
at BASTID, Big Rock, a little Ratman,
we out of here is hip hop witch bitch.

718
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,007
Just fucking hands on the steering wheel.

719
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,547
My first encounter with

720
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:07,918
Miles is in Newport, and I was doing
some promotional stuff on that.

721
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,589
I have my daughter with me this beautiful
afternoon to be in the mall,

722
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,925
and I look up to the second level,

723
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,295
and I thought I saw it and figured
it was a fast moving figure .

724
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:22,032
And she definitely was a hood rat,
though I could tell she was from the hood.

725
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,735
It didn't look suburban at all.
She was definitely from the hood.

726
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,804
It looked like she was smoking something.

727
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,405
I wasn't really I couldn't make out

728
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:32,209
if it was a cigaret or a blond,
but she was whuppin and she was just

729
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:36,680
standing there staring at me,
go, you let me go. And I was plug.

730
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,516
I mean, I'm not scared of anybody.

731
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:43,821
But this this, you know, that's
that's not supposed to be said.

732
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,624
It could even be a flyball thing

733
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:50,594
that I think I can remember
telling me for a couple of times.

734
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:55,265
So I'll go and I'll see
if this is the squad thing.

735
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,900
Maybe she just come in after

736
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,771
like the hottest squad on the marquee
and maybe she just coming up

737
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,975
to the hottest female on the market, Dirty
Harry brand name for.

738
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,612
And I told my road manager, yo,
I think she's after me.

739
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,280
But no, nobody saw.

740
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,516
So I'm just standing there looking.

741
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,685
Whatever you doing, just keep it moving.

742
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,221
I don't even want
to talk about it anymore.

743
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,456
I mean, yo, yo, yo.

744
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:25,029
Which I'll tell you who else
they await the wit purple here.

745
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,131
Yo il powers yo.

746
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,400
She was talking about Yeezus
fleece stallion's.

747
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,402
She's just that's
my little daughter for me.

748
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:36,273
I saw a little karate move
but hip hop with yo what's chill.

749
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:48,218
Really? I came to
to give you some good news.

750
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,889
I I've been noticing

751
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,794
you having everything in order here,
and I think you've been doing a great job.

752
00:44:56,794 --> 00:45:00,597
And there's another opportunity

753
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:04,568
to be a trainee in another position
has come available. Oh, really?

754
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,505
Yeah. And I think that you'd be perfect.

755
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,176
Well, basically, you know,

756
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,212
I think that I would be perfect
for the last one you gave away.

757
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,616
I'm sorry. I did not

758
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,252
I didn't do the right thing.

759
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,455
I might have made a bad choice.
I think you did.

760
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:25,823
I think you did.

761
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,226
And I'm sorry. Just isn't enough for me.

762
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,962
But that's all you're going
to give me then.

763
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,465
So be it. But I'm a little busy
right now, actually.

764
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:40,437
Well, that being the case
now in the future, that was the past.

765
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,773
What I'm saying now
is, is another opportunity.

766
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,276
And in this opportunity,
you have the opportunity

767
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:50,914
to bring in your own story,
and it could be great for you. And

768
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,885
remember, while back
when you mentioned this hip hop project.

769
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,157
Remember this? Yeah,
and I completely shot it down. Yeah. OK.

770
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,659
I'm thinking that I'm changing my mind

771
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:08,365
and I think that
this could be a great story,

772
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:12,069
a great lead, that it could really put
crumpled prices over the top.

773
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,471
Too bad. So sad. Sorry.
I don't know anything.

774
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,806
The guy that I was trying
to get in contact

775
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,442
with, basically, I can't find
and I kind of stopped pursuing it.

776
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,314
OK, what guy? You know what?

777
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,416
You watch TV just like I do.

778
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:30,087
But in the meantime,
I have things to do and coffee to make.

779
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,071
Hi, I'm Isabelle
Gunsight or hip hop watch TV.

780
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,842
I am still in front of Slim Shady Studios
waiting for Eminem

781
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,011
and Split to come out and do an interview.

782
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,712
So I'm down on the goddamn floor.

783
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:59,483
You know, same with this witch's
finger up my ass or whatever.

784
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,985
And I don't know what the fuck's going on

785
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,821
because I'm still twitching
and I'm tweaking.

786
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:08,492
You know, I'm saying if she's
laughing at me, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

787
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,596
And I'm yo. I'm plugging
you me at this point.

788
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,933
I don't know. I started to have like this
little evil green.

789
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,636
No, I mean, it's like a little green.

790
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,873
Like, I don't know,
I wasn't really scared.

791
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,641
You know what I'm saying at the time,

792
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,044
it felt really good,
you know what I'm saying?

793
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,645
It kind of felt good, you know?

794
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:33,050
So so I'm having this good feeling
of of the ex, you know what I'm saying?

795
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,520
And then I just like fall down.

796
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,457
But I'm already on the floor
and then I just like fall down.

797
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,859
But I'm already on the floor.

798
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,299
So I'm already on the floor, but I felt,
you know what I'm saying?

799
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,669
So I'm on the floor falling.
I'm still falling.

800
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,671
You don't say it, but. But

801
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:59,109
like my my my my face is at this point,
and I'm starting to look like her.

802
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:00,811
You know what I'm saying?

803
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,380
And I'm like, yo, are you listening to me?

804
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:06,583
I'm going to cut an interview
with the legendary rap star.

805
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,353
Ice ice baby during his comeback tour.

806
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:14,892
Vanilla Ice. Crazy which?

807
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,729
Believe it, that's all you.

808
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,965
No joke. Real deal.

809
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:27,004
She's got many faces, but the deal that I
saw was like she came, she was beautiful.

810
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,841
She was like this naked chick, you know,
sitting up in front of my concern.

811
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,610
She was on the airplane
on the way over to Japan.

812
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:38,181
She comes up and says, screaming,
I've got to have you.

813
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,049
I got to have you.

814
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:40,951
You're my destiny and all this stuff.

815
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:42,853
And I'm like, what's going on?

816
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:43,921
I wake up, I look back

817
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,791
and she lay on the ground and everybody's
like to tackle these people, tackle this.

818
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,092
You know what's going on.

819
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,994
I thought the plane was going
to crash or something before

820
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,231
we landed and everything was cool.

821
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,601
I went to the hotel and, you know,
you could see that look in her eyes.

822
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,102
She had some scary about it.

823
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,607
You know, it wasn't even when the ice.

824
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,609
How are you doing?
How are you doing? Hi, my name is Val.

825
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,679
How are you doing? Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry. You're doing something to.

00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:17,054
I know. And I'm a director.
You know all that milk.

829
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,189
Who is this guy? Anybody who hears me.

830
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,059
What are you talking about, man?
Get out of here.

831
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,061
I don't know what's going
on, man. You're freaking me out.

832
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,964
You're like you're getting to look
that evil. Look in your eyes, man.

833
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,100
You need get something to go with that
with away from that hip hop, which.

834
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,103
No joke, no joke. She's hating

835
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,140
yo picks once called Professor X.

836
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,843
Now the persona is unstable.

837
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,815
It's due to the con and the atrocities
happening in this crazy world poll.

838
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,284
Two thousand something strange

839
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:50,687
back in the day as I was fighting wars
in the streets, Crown Heights.

840
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,357
It was a strange looking car.

841
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,760
I think she's a witch
which will soon be looking for the bomb,

842
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:01,431
ready to give her a permanent net seat.

843
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:05,869
So whoever looking for me
won't be permanently put to sleep.

844
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,973
Straight up, that's my word.

845
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:18,882
So that just about engaged.

846
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,986
And we think God is real, man.

847
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:31,194
I mean, well, I mean,

848
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,131

849
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:44,074
Nothing. Well, to say nothing,

851
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,149
Nothing built this ship
from the ground up.

852
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,785
It built this whole fucking ship.

853
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,520

I don't know what they're
should be happening right now. Really?

890
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:58,602
We just need time.

891
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,270

Yeah, you look funny to me, by the way.

00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,024
Just ahead, what you feel about

00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,294
You know, in the alleyway.
Not so. You got that.

00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:25,495
You're going to do it. Do it.

904
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:56,359

You don't care about anything
but yourself, man. Manuel.

908
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,763
So the fuck is everybody?

This is a trip saying

915
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,386
That's beautiful.

916
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,688
How am I supposed to get girls
like this is nasty.

917
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:00,957
I ain't going to happen.

918
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,092
Stay away from the nasty bitch.

919
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,260
I got to have a good dentist.

920
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,900
She's coming. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

922
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,707
It's my mama. My mom Covid.

923
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,343
My mom is Covid.

924
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,011
My mom is coming.

925
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,381
My mom is coming

926
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,617
to go over. All this time.

927
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:32,088
I thought he was talking about me,
which was kind of scary. It's mama.

928
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,393
Have faith. Oh, good Lord.

929
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,800
I'm Isabelle Calzado for hip hop watch TV.

930
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,836
As you can see, we're still stationed
in front of Slim Shady Studios

931
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,504
waiting for Emmett.

932
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,576
This just in Mobb Deep is missing.

933
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,814
The only thing that was found was the
cameraman's camera and a disturbing tape.

934
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:02,352
This one like man just woke up
out of nowhere because business came on.

935
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,888
Ozanne wasn't nobody really nowhere.

936
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,290
So I'm like, I don't have time to sit on.

937
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,392
My yo ain't going to sit on. No.

938
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,628
So I'm going to turn it off, man.

939
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,129
And then I just fell ill.

940
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,064
Costarring coal ash.

941
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,467
I just started seeing mother setting foot

942
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,570
in the I'm in my fuckin boxes,
I'm like, what the fuck?

943
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,005
They're all gone.

944
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:24,808
E w was gone and he was gone.

945
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:28,344
And the hip hop business Jenckes
has been chasing me around the house.

946
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,479
We just come home.

947
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,614
We just got finished with Modie
Music, the movie,

948
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,149
and we see something in the backyard.

949
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:36,219
It was like right over here,
you know, saying to me, hey,

950
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,522
if we got out the car, we came over here
probably like six in the morning there.

951
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,691
And it's quite late.

952
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,027
And it's just tell us it was raining.

953
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,829
Like I said, it was crazy, man.

954
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,231
And then music started
playing in the house again. Oh, no.

955
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,232
I think the best song

956
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,302
Stop Maldive thinks you don't want us
to come home or near the movies.

957
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,437
You'll want to come out
with our music no more.

958
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:56,906
That's how that's
my impression is to sit down.

959
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,443
And plus, it's got something to do
with drinking because the smell like Henny

960
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:03,480
and he double it out
every time he come around

961
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,382
and all the beer is gone,
all the big fucking going.

962
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,184
They drink the Heny and a beer is crazy.

963
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,119
No alcoholic fucking witch.

964
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:37,180
What's up? Hey, you
got to you got to help, Nick.

965
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,148
OK, if you give me five.

966
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,452
You know what works for Shitara?

967
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:48,091
What are you doing?

968
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,727
Oh, I got to go.

969
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:53,229
I got I got to go.
I've got to go. Come on.

970
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,798
Come on. This one.
I was waiting for you. I got to you.

971
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,201
You get what you want to get that
which you got to see about that.

972
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,803
What is it you talk about?
White kids, white pug.

973
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,238
We're on The Brady Bunch.

974
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:04,741
No white kids are going to tell me that.

975
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:05,608
So you could tell me.

976
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,545
So you're not going to give me

977
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:13,082
any. No, no. Go get things. Go golfing.

978
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,618
What's the matter with you?

979
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:16,619
Oh, you're a pretty girl.

980
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,422
You're you know, you're
you'll let me. Can you sell them? Not.

981
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,394
That's true. I'm

982
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:28,498
a puppeteer so much. Oh.

983
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,816
What up right now are you doing stuff?

984
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,053
You got some Cormick.

985
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,922
All right, all right, all right.

986
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,094
Good looking good.

987
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,997
All right, this on we got to do got a deal

988
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:03,933
rather than just like we discussed.

989
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,870
Yeah, you too, baby. All right, now.

990
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,306
But like my my my

991
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,409
my face is at this point
like starting to look like her.

992
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,680
You know, I'm saying and I'm like, Yo,
are you listening to me?

993
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,351
I doubt you'll be listening
in on this. And I came in.

994
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,321
I should have thought the reason
what they should green in

995
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:29,125
Dickstein is really it is
it is like a marijuana plant.

996
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:32,662
Fatwa Sakwa anyway, so and so.

997
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,064
So I got my finger
over the beaches there. Right.

998
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,401
I couldn't even get
my fingers up her ass. OK.

999
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,038
She still got her
finger urines, she is trying

1000
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,074
to put a finger in my eyes, but
my finger was like all the way up there.

1001
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,111
So all the sudden the room got dark

1002
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:51,414
and I couldn't see shit.

1003
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:55,451
But a big ass face
like just this hideous like monster,

1004
01:00:55,451 --> 01:01:00,923
I don't know what it was, a Yoda's
GIRoA. Oh, I hope.

1005
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,227
Oh, we love that.

1006
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,196
We got to shout out.

1007
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:10,667
Stay away from the hip with
the beat is crazy.

1008
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,005
We have this murder.

1009
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,173
I'll murder that bitch.

1010
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,876
Come in. I'll get a promise.

1011
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,211
Got something? All right.

1012
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,313
Yeah. Shit. Yup.

1013
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:29,519
I thought had seen me
go read a book about a young woman.

1014
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,722
My motherfucker kind of walk like a man.

1015
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:36,059
This one was more
like it did come out. Oh.

1016
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:57,647
Pissed off at by. Five. Oh. Boy.

1017
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,959
The rule of law, Jim, was just the Javert

1018
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,229
looking motherfucker just came in.

1019
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,701
Hey, boys. I heard
you were looking for rapper.

1020
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,873
Look, though, Jim,
how are you doing big zabo?

1021
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,410
All right, well, I hear you having
a little contest and I wanted to audition.

1022
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,878
I'm a rapper from Atlanta.

1023
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:31,781
You have to come in on a session right now
and you know what I'm saying?

1024
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,951
Well, I just want to do my thing right.
I could do my thing.

1025
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,753
I want to see it do something.

1026
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,856
Oh, no. Forget it.

1027
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,792
No. What do you think?

1028
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,994
Well, this be what you have.

1029
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:49,365
It's going to be worth it. All right.

1030
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,836
Yes. Who was that that she talked about,
You've Got a Baby by Rick.

1031
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,540
He chose not to cheer when I left,
but nothing will hit me back

1032
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,077
tonight. Rick, by
sticking in a real place sometimes.

1033
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,080
But as far as I'm coming in, you pay.
That's the last thing they do.

1034
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,048
Try to get an extra check.

1035
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,684
Bizzocchi, please.
Oh, I bet. Is it your dad?

1036
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:12,255
I think so. Wadewitz,
Altieri, Gojo, baby daddy.

1037
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,490
I can't look more like the best friends.

1038
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,528
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

1039
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,098
That ain't so, baby, daddy.
Oh, that's my baby daddy.

1040
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,169
She got her daddy
because that's my baby daddy.

1041
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:31,440
That ain't no baby daddy because
that's my baby daddy, man, baby daddy.

1042
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,777
You both my baby's
dad got yourself a deal.

1043
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,480
I've got to sit with you. Hey, fellas.

1044
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,049
Come on. Come on.

1045
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,021
I got an offer. I know. I know.

1046
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:46,823
Oh, baby. I heard the

1047
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:52,862
baby. I heard you were giving a.

1048
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:58,968
Now, as for which hip hop,
which is something you.

1049
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,072
Right, you know, channels
to get more popular,

1050
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,675
you know what you know about the ways

1051
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:09,879
about the question you find out about
the which I'm talking about. No record.

1052
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,081
There should be a record deal.
I'm trying to get.

1053
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,149
Okay. I understand.

1054
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,686
But what about the girls, the kid,
the girls and the pug and something?

1055
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,188
I don't know nothing about that because I
going to keep up with that kind of stuff.

1056
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,990
But somebody tell me something about kids.

1057
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:24,360
And, you know, my kids in the park
wouldn't know anything about that.

1058
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:28,464
Oh, cool. But I do know about that to me
now that I could give away.

1059
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:30,733
You can tell me about
the kids in the poor.

1060
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,602
Those lovely about the free.

1061
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,172
The kids go hard

1062
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:40,142
when the person he is
and what else I got to do this

1063
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:45,882
big z, d, p q r is t, y, z. Hmm.

1064
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:49,886
Mm hmm. I find it so attractive

1065
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,289
when a man is involved in such danger.

1066
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,524
Ooh, look at me.

1067
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:56,592
Why don't you make

1068
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,428
what your face looks familiar?

1069
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:01,697
What are you talking about, baby?
I'm from Atlanta.

1070
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,933
Come on. Come on, baby.

1071
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,069
Don't do this to little chip, baby.

1072
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,307
Don't you want some little blue chip?

1073
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,111
Don't you want some? You don't.

1074
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:20,449
You don't do, baby.

1075
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:23,119
What am I to fuck you know about this?

1076
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:27,857
The white kids shit. Covid.

1077
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:38,467
Hello? Yes. Yes,
the fuck happened again, man. Hey,

1078
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,570
what's up, man? What's going on?

1079
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:42,638
Yeah, nothing much.

1080
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,740
Yeah, I thought I told you
not to contact me, man.

1081
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,743
We're supposed to be talking
right about now. Fuck that, man.

1082
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,613
What we got to do
is we got to stop all this bullshit.

1083
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,248
You tell them the orders
that they've been attacked

1084
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:53,983
by which you know all that shit like that.

1085
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:54,817
We got the media on.

1086
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,987
I asked specifically this one bitch,
you know, if they should keep

1087
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:01,824
fucking coming to the studio first,
like you crazy fools went and murdered.

1088
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:05,795
Big Don would pull in that Reservoir Dogs
Pulp Fiction bullshit.

1089
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:09,365
You guys, they bring in a rain,
a police down on all of us, man.

1090
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:10,733
It's going to ruin it for every.

1091
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:13,102
Oh, Casey. Shit, I can't see nothing.

1092
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,839
All I can feel is like like my finger up
an asshole, you know,

1093
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,408
I'm saying I couldn't even tell you
if it was an amount of pussy.

1094
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,410
I don't know. Whoa.
I don't know where it was.

1095
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,079
It was somewhere
I could have stuck it in a hole

1096
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,480
in the wall of fucking light socket.

1097
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,150
I don't know. But all of a sudden
I just start like

1098
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,921
twitching in these hives, start
coming out on me and shit. Right. So. So

1099
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:37,259
what I tried to do during the
midst of the tussle, you know, I'm saying

1100
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:41,931
in the scuffle, I'm trying to like
slip person, you know what I'm saying?

1101
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,967
So she can get well at.

1102
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,204
You know, I mean, yeah,
but I was at like thirty

1103
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,140
thousand feet with portable
electronics can no longer be used

1104
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,576
and that to be stored
in the overhead cabinet. OK.

1105
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:59,448
So I was like really fucking hard, you
know, I mean, so I'm laughing and smiling

1106
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:03,085
and she's crying and we're both laughing
and we're both having a good time.

1107
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:06,622
And and next thing I know,
you'll all wake up

1108
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,958
with my dick in my hand beating my shit.

1109
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:13,295
You can see I am still here
in front of Slim Shady Studios.

1110
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:17,166
Waiting for Eminem is uplifting Britney
an interview, but they are not coming out.

1111
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,602
So in the meantime,
we're going to go to a news bulletin.

1112
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:22,438
You know, someone
said, you know, some like,

1113
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,075
yeah, she stuck his
finger in her. That's right.

1114
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,078
People always doing that too slow.

1115
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:31,080
Probably because we move
people all the time.

1116
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,349
Yo, Miss Royce, five nine.

1117
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,917
Do not fuck with that hip hop bitch.

1118
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,620
That bitch is fucking crazy. This is Rick.

1119
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,056
Whatever. You do not fuck with the hip

1120
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:44,660
hop, which was scary,
scary, scary, scary, scary.

1121
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,763
Bitch. Yo, don't mess with me.

1122
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:49,865
So what's the problem?

1123
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:51,734
Talk to anybody.

1124
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:55,971
Yeah, I got. Right now
I believe you. Yeah.

1125
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,873
I mean I Premiere. Yeah.

1126
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,375
Got to leave before we leave.

1127
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:02,144
Oh, she travels. Right.

1128
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,512
So with the cell phone

1129
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,982
the fuck out of all shit
so she can ask why we got cell phone.

1130
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:11,720
Make sure to communicate via
cell phone radiation.

1131
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,222
Fucka which up. Does he

1132
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:18,094
see the wishes coming by now, mama?

1133
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,797
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm the landlady.

1134
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,237
Don't leave home without a candle.

1135
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:30,973
My name is. My name is KRP
Christmas Macerate.

1136
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,609
I was walking out like

1137
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:36,645
this lady say they'll Opry's.

1138
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,417
That's what little black. Overs.

1139
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,321
You know my name. Will those.

1140
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,024
He said that's how much it will.

1141
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:54,029
Word versus I'm like your go

1142
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,500
hand my back to sin and love.

1143
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,802
All of a sudden, I feel this love

1144
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:08,878
that fills my head. She who?

1145
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:15,751
What is that? That's poke.

1146
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,187
She just public. It's just yes.

1147
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,723
Just because once

1148
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,493
you see that he's right,
that everybody should push.

1149
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,863
We've been here.

1150
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,332
For over three hours,
we can't be here all night, guys.

1151
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,102
We can't we can't stay here all night.

1152
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,737
We got them. They're going
to we're going to get us.

1153
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,874
The street, Don, is a stupid.

1154
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,576
He owns these fucking projects.

1155
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,411
We've got we got to fucking keep going.

1156
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:46,115
I'll tell you what. I'm stamens.

1157
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,684
He's right. Fucking
get back to the fucking tent.

1158
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:54,356
Sleep, wake up. Well,
if I can just get the fuck out of you.

1159
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:57,059
We need to band together now

1160
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,161
and remember that song
that first brought us all together.

1161
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,796
Remember that song?

1162
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:05,000
Don't you want me, baby? Don't shoot.

1163
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:09,371
Oh, I want to go.

1164
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,207
I just want to fucking get out of here,

1165
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:15,311
but I got to film this shit, guys, OK,
in case we fucking found dead and shot.

1166
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,180
Yeah, we've get this
fucking videotape here.

1167
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:25,921
That because the plug. Here's what.

1168
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:30,659
Sounds like screaming. No, I just got.

1169
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,163
You know who the folks this.

1170
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:36,765
You know, this isn't funny.

1171
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:39,301
Stop it, stop it. Stop playing around.

1172
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,070
Oh, it's the dog.

1173
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,305
Who the fuck the bear?

1174
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:44,940
If you saw someone.

1175
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,280
We'll check it out, man,
I fucking check it out.

1176
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,216
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't sign up for this man.

1177
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,318
You know, the ten million dollars
upgrade, great, but.

1178
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:57,920
This is crazy, man.

1179
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,123
No, it does not know that, you know.

1180
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,262
We could end up dead.

1181
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,631
What do you want to say
to you, to your parents and everybody?

1182
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,733
I don't really care.

1183
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:14,069
For that sort of thing.

1184
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,939
Leave her alone. OK, tough guy.

1185
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:21,143
You fucking tell me what's cooking
next for you, man. OK, baby girl.

1186
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:24,880
Miss Sgro, what do you have to say?

1187
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,584
I don't know they could.

1188
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,053
There's no time to think about it.

1189
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,922
I don't want to think about any of this.
I'm going to do that.

1190
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,859
You know, that's your fucking problem,
too. You're always trying to escape.

1191
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,160
You want to go to a fucking club.

1192
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,396
You want a fucking party.
You want to fucking do some text.

1193
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:41,797
You want to fucking run, run.

1194
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,767
Well, I wish I was doing it right now
because I sure as hell would rather be

1195
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:49,104
doing that than sitting here
freaking out over these freaky people.

1196
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,642
Mr Spiritual, what do you
have to say about this whole fucking mess?

1197
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,612
Come on, tell the world something, Mr.

1198
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,281
Mr Profound. Say something.

1199
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,118
I can't find my rock.

1200
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,154
I can't. Did you take my rock?

1201
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,092
Well, I can't find my fucking rock man.

1202
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,562
Me, you don't have it.

1203
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,933
You want your fucking rock?

1204
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:23,806
This is well, actually the man who it is,
I need you to meet me

1205
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,942
at 18th and Central Avenue.

1206
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,780
Oh, you better beat it would just say

1207
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,683
it's about a poke and five white kids.

1208
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,388
Don't be know what it's like
to talk about sports.

1209
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,865
Fuck big Z, fuck the witch.

1210
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:54,169
Fuck the far way, kids, fuck everybody.

1211
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:57,272
The street, Don, is dead after police

1212
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,775
and Coast Guard authorities comb
the murky waters.

1213
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,578
They finally recover the body of St.

1214
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:06,281
John, the infamous and legendary
rap music mogul.

1215
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,586
I repeat the street
Dunn is dead. I hear things.

1216
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:22,564
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

1217
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,470
What's he talking about, man?

1218
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,239
What the hell are you talking about?

1219
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,008
He's start overreacting about things
like. That's exactly.

1220
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,747
So sorry, I thought you

1221
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,316
heard about the what are you with
about the money?

1222
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,993
I took over row.

1223
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:54,530
To talk dirty, you talk more topic rice.

1224
01:13:56,465 --> 01:14:05,774
You know what? I see. We.

1225
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,185
I want to move. And I'm seen.

1226
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:26,428
I get. The real, the real.

1227
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,808
Don't fight with the bucket,
wet lights came on again.

1228
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:42,611
It was standing there.

1229
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:45,747
I don't know what the fuck
I had my arm like behind my back,

1230
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:49,518
and it was in her eyes,
my whole arm was in her eyes.

1231
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,754
And I think she was trying to swallow me.

1232
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,523
You know what I'm saying now?

1233
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,993
I couldn't tell you if it was if it was
if it was the X.

1234
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,262
I couldn't tell you
if it was the hot button.

1235
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,932
I couldn't tell you if it was the butter
knife that I fucking slit her throat with.

1236
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,134
I couldn't tell you anything like that.

1237
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:09,872
But listen, man,
I don't fuck with the witch no more.

1238
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,908
I can't fuck with the witch no more.

1239
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:15,811
Like even if someone tells me
the drugs are still free,

1240
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:18,680
I can't fuck with the
witch no more. She's really.

1241
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:42,905
Nickname. I think those my look for those.

1242
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,441
What the fuck is this bitch?

1243
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,677
White kids in the pug mixi,
I'm doing my job.

1244
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,078
I work for a newspaper.

1245
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,747
No, you didn't know,
you know, come on, baby.

1246
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:54,049
It's not it's basically
some of the people that's in here.

1247
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:57,119
But I'll tell you, some bitch
little thing. Hold up. You know what?

1248
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,422
They don't fuck around with Big Z,
you understand what I'm saying?

1249
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,824
I'm not trying to fuck around with you.
I'm just doing my job.

1250
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,160
I'm trying to do my job and get

1251
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,162
You know anything.
Nobody's saying that you did it.

1252
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:08,664
Nobody's saying that you did enough.

1253
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,899
But if you know anything,
I need to know the big Z.

1254
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,702
Five white kids in a pug
disappeared in New York.

1255
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:14,603
I don't know. Nothing to do.

1256
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,706
You know something about the why the fuck
you on the on the pictures with the kids.

1257
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,341
Nobody's saying they talked to you.

1258
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,377
Maybe you just talking to him.
But if you know anything, help me, please.

1259
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:23,946
It's me. Tell you something,

1260
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:27,716
if I catch a motherfucking ass where again
on the stump, your mother fucking ass.

1261
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:28,750
Definitely daddy's.

1262

Just doing my fucking job, all right.

01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,025
And I want to know about the street

1264
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:41,797
down the street down
how you kill the street dog.

1265
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,833
You know him, you know the white kids,
but you know the street gang.

1266

Don't fucking take your fucking

They got a map. You got to stop telling

I don't have to stop to you

1271
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,321

the groundwork for this stuff.

01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:08,090
And I'm just watching it.

1273
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,760

the white kids in the pug.

entrance to find your answers there.

01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:00,275

like those witches from Eastwick.

1318
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:03,044

1319
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:04,646
Truth niggers back in my a life.

1320
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,581

1321
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:10,418
come around and put a hold upon the light
for any rapid Ashlee's Stop sleeping.

1322
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:14,155
Stop reaching this online game
and that they can never disregard teachers

1323
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,625
up a nigga restrikes they get down
before they can said it was right.

1324
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:18,693
I'll bring it to light.

1325
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:21,262
Either we fabricio get together,
we could split the chatter

1326
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,797
or separate us song whatever.

1327
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:24,499
As long as I live forever with fam,

1328
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:28,570
I can't let you get tear flesh and rip
open your bitch ass near death

1329
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:32,607
so you better wise up quick before it's
too late for y'all to recognize this shit.

1330
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:34,609
Are you afraid of the dark?

1331
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,911
Okay, what about the wisdom of the club.

1332
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:40,281
If you tell me to
let me see the loudest voice times

1333
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:44,352
and the witches, I can get my heart to
that or any kind of seatings.

1334
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,088
You know, I don't believe in things.

1335
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:49,324
And nobody has been party to you or me.

1336
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,492
But how are you going to go?

1337
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,061
Can't say you can't
see you, me, the drama.

1338
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:57,065
Never see still like the belly of the
beast, reminiscent of fellow rappers

1339
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,033
that went beneath.

1340
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,301
I mean, these streets, rappers from those
that went to heaven,

1341
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,070
that went to hell is so real.

1342
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,607
It's just a lesson that we learned
while we on earth, way before the past.

1343
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:07,175
My history is twisted.

1344
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:10,311
I was born Christmas
and not I saw a happen in many ways.

1345
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,814
Feel like I'm in a daze,
going through a wicked phase

1346
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:16,051
into the stage of a nigga
ready for death, ready for life.

1347
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,388
He married the mice, which has forced me
to carry my striken to the grave.

1348
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,724
Still amazed at the outcome.
The chicken may.

1349
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,293
Is it a phase or
a way of life in the city?

1350
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,829
This type city know
when these witches is trying to get me.

1351
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:30,432
They cast members got fake news
trying to stick me.

1352
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:34,169
That's why I walk around
with the state committee made up to talk

1353
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,006
about the wisdom of the club.

1354
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:40,375
Let me see them not as far back
as they were, something

1355
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:44,846
which is out to get my heart beat at any
time to see these things.

1356
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,082
You know, I don't believe in things.

1357
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,317
And you know what
this means to you, to you or me.

1358
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:50,485
How are you going to go?

1359
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:52,687
Can't say you can't see you. Tell me.

1360
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:57,959
This is real nice.
