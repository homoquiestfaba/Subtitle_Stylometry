a convicted murderer

13
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:44,104
that led to Niente"s conviction.

14
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:45,844
Well, shortly before his death,

15
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,020

to planting this evidence.

17

20

confess your sins."

"Cecilia, you" re right.

00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,846
[thunder rumbling]

360
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,537
This is Bobby, over.

361
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,539
[dispatcher over radio]
Hey, Bobby.

362
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:48,150
[Bobby] I think we found our
boy with his hand in the cookie jar.

363
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:50,631
So you might want
to send me some backup.

364
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,198
All right, honey?

365
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,066
Julio?

366
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,284
Julio!

367
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,207
[vase shatters][Julio] No!

368
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,166
Shut up,
you little shit! Shut up! Let me go! No!

369
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,820
Stop right there,
asshole.[panting] Dad. Dad.

370
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:51,387
Julio.Dad.

371
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,434
[screams]Julio, calm down.

372
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:57,306
[shouts]Everything"s gonna be okay.

373
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,180
Motherfucker. Hey!

374
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:04,792
You so much as twitch, I"m gonna blow
your goddamn brains out, you hear me?

375
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:07,838
You see, actions
have consequences.

376
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,710
Or didn"t they teach you
that in prison?

377
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,974
What, you think
you can come into my home,

378
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,889
fuck my woman,
and get away with it?

379
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,587
You let go of my son right now.

380
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,242
You see, that"s not gonna happen,
because he"s coming with me.

381
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,461
Riley, bury him.

382
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:22,636
[Julio screams][grunts]

383
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,942
[Vincent] Fuck!

384
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,074
Fuck!

385
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:33,647
[grunts]

386
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,736
[Bobby] Drop it! [grunts]

387
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,085
[Julio gasps]

388
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,915
Come on![grunts] Get off!

389
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:42,961
Where is he?
Where the fuck is he? Dad!

390
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:45,615
Find him and kill him![Julio grunts]

391
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:48,923
I"m going to find you!
You broke my fucking arm!

392
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:52,361
You fucking wetback,
skinny little shit motherfucker!

393
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:55,799
Where are you, man?
Where are you?

394
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,107
I"m gonna fucking kill you. You got
to say your fucking prayers, buddy!

395
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,848
Say your fucking prayers!

396
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,463
[gunshot]

397
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:12,077
Get in! Dad!

398
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,166
[Vincent grunts][Neto] Julio!

399
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,385
Shut up, or I"ll
shoot you in the face.

400
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,518
[Neto] Julio![tires screech]

401
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:23,131
[police siren wailing]

402
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,531
[siren stops]

403
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,060
Freeze!

404
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,148
Stop!

405
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:02,475
Now, I picked up your stuff.

406
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:05,347
Got your money and
your clothes from the motel.

407
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:09,395
Did the cops find Vincent?
No. No, nothing yet.

408
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,962
To tell you the truth, I don "t
think they" re particularly bothered.

409
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,964
What are you talking about?
I told "em about Vincent,

410
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,010
but all they really wanna do
is find The Jesuit.

411
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,491
The whole force seems to
have a bit of a hard-on for you.

412
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,623
Can"t say I blame them, really.

413
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,931
A vicious little fucker like you, a
murderer, gets released from prison.

414
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:27,326
Four days later, his wife and a
police sergeant are found shot to death,

415
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,545
and they see you running
from the scene of the crime.

416
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,287
Fuck. Fuck is right.

417
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,637
You gave them the needle
on the golden platter, mate.

418
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:37,466
I need to find Julio fast.

419
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,775
Well, bastard"s probably
gotten across the border by now.

420
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,298
Did you find out
anything about him?

421
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,822
Well, I made a few phone calls.

422
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,824
Um, Feds definitely
had him on their radar.

423
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:51,567
He"s supposed to be smuggling
a truckload of guns down south.

424
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:53,787
To tell you the truth,

425
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:56,181
Vincent makes people
a little bit nervous.

426
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:57,312
You know what I mean?

427
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,314
"La Cara del Norte," right?

428
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:01,490
Um, that"s his nickname,
"The Face of the North."

429
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,189
Why do you fucking people
always have to have nicknames?

430
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,104
[sighs] So?

431
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:09,759
Well, he was supposed
to have hooked up with, um,

432
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,240
a local gunrunner
by the name of Jet Rink.

433
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:15,200
That"s his real name, by the
way. That"s not a fucking nickname.

434
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:17,245
He"s a Catholic cunt, like you.

435
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:18,638
I think you should look him up.

436
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,466
Do you know where
I can find him?

437
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,773
Yeah, he owns a place
called Lady Birds.

438
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:26,036
What, the titty bar?

439
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,473
Yeah, that"s the one, yeah.

440
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:32,608
[car engine starts]

441
00:35:32,782 --> 00:35:35,045
[Neto]
I need one more thing from you.

442
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,667
You got a full tank. I owe you big-time.

443
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,712
In that case,
do me a favor? Yeah?

444
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:51,453
Big-time. Yeah?

445
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:52,933
Forget my fucking number

446
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,196
before these psychos
kill me too.

447
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,116
[people cheering, whistling]

448
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,249
[upbeat dance music
playing in club]

449
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:06,049
[upbeat dance music
playing over speakers]

450
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,052
[customer whistles]

451
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,804
[customer 2] Yeah!

452
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,388
Hi there.[dancer]
No, I did. I swear.

453
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:44,087
Yes, I said that
the next weekend after...

454
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,220
You"re up, sweetie.
There"s a man at the bar.

455
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:48,483
Not today.
I just can"t take it today.

456
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:51,181
[dancer]
Why? He looks nice. I"m going upstairs.

457
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,837
Howdy. Hi, I"d like a coffee,
please.

458
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:57,492
Uh, black? Yeah, black"s fine.

459
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,277
All right, there"s
a two-drink minimum.

460
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,757
I guess I"ll have two then.

461
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:04,020
Can I get
a black coffee, please?

462
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:09,504
How you doing? I"m fine, thanks.

463
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:10,766
Good.

464
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,942
All right, thank you.

465
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,466
All right, follow me.

466
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,296
[customer whistles]

467
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,561
There you are,
best seat in the house.

468
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,215
That"ll be $20.

469
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:33,746
Nice! Do you want company? Sure.

470
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:37,619
What"s your name? Inez.

471
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,670
That"s interesting.

472
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:46,411
Interesting for a stripper,
you mean?

473
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,108
Like it"s not
a regular stripper name?

474
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:51,677
What"s yours?

475
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,683
You know what Inez means?

476
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:01,817
It"s from Agnes.
It means "holy" or "chaste."

477
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,648
I bet I know
what you "re think in".

478
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,737
[chuckles] You "re think in",

479
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:11,479
"Oh, I bet you"ve been
"chased,"" or something like that.

480
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,220
Listen, honey.
I"m looking for Jet.

481
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,658
Who? Jet Rink.

482
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,010
I"m sorry.
I don"t know the guy.

483
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:28,366
You have a good time.

484
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:31,630
I"ll see ya.

485
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:35,285
[upbeat music continues playing]

486
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,852
[customers whistle, cheer]

487
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:49,256
[giggles] Baby, stop it.
What you making?

488
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,953
Lobster?
I like lobster.

489
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,826
[phone ringing]Mm-hmm. Butter?

490
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:57,656
Wait a second.
What?

491
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,571
[Inez] That cute Mexican"s
looking for Jet.

492
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,442
Tell Waylon to get his piece.

493
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,618
[customer whistling]

494
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,971
I"m looking for Jet.

495
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:13,019
He"s out sick today.

496
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,151
Called in.

497
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,197
You take a wrong turn?

498
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:19,808
A friend of mine, Vincent Rice,

499
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,549
suggested I contact Jet.

500
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:23,029
Said he"d help me out.

501
00:40:23,203 --> 00:40:24,683
[customer whistles]

502
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,297
Lots of gun dealers in town,
they can do the same.

503
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,820
I understand that.

504
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:34,170
The thing is, Vincent
owes him some money.

505
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,695
[snaps fingers]

506
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,785
Here"s a down payment.

507
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,701
[Waylon] Hey, Collie. Is this
the spic I"ve gotta get rid of?

508
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,790
Everything"s fine, Waylon.

509
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,231
You want some rice and beans?

510
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,587
So, you got a number for him?

511
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,591
What"s your name?

512
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,594
Just tell him, um,

513
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:09,815
I want to establish a
long-term relationship, okay?

514
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:12,644
Really? How nice.

515
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:15,168
Hey, baby.

516
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,779
I got a fricking spic here.
He says he wants to...

517
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:19,607
Yeah, from Vincent.

518
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:21,870
I don"t...

519
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,179
Name?

520
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,746
John.

521
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:29,922
[chuckles]

522
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,315
Yeah.

523
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,274
John.

524
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,755
No, he"s a fricking beaner,
that"s what he...

525
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:40,193
All right, babe, I don"t
think it"s a good idea.

526
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:42,325
Fine. No, I...

527
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:44,937
Fine.

528
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,468
You can go out by his house,

529
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:56,862
out by Beeville.

530
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,952
Armadillo 67.

531
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,215
Don"t be there before midnight.

532
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,045
Call before you ring the bell.

533
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:09,483
[scoffs]

Of course, you already
met my beautiful wife.

565

But this one"s not for sale.

588
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:02,830

And now you want
to work against him?

608
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:04,631
It"s called capitalism.

I"d like you to be my wife.

718
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:54,622
Well, shit.
That"s some job.

719
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:56,450
Well, not the conjugal part,

720
00:53:56,624 --> 00:53:59,932
just the pretending to be my
wife part to cross the border.

721
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:02,804
You mean not to care about
each other, just to pretend,

722
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:04,806
like... like a real wife?

723
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,373
Yeah.
You got a passport?

724
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,767
How much you paying
for this job, mister?

725
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:10,464
Well...

726
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:14,294
It"s only a day, so...

727
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,559
How about 500?

728
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:28,917
How about a thousand?

729
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:32,791
It gets really busy here
on the weekends.

730
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,403
And do I get
to keep my clothes on?

731
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,709
Yes, ma"am.

732
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:41,147
And then what happens?
Well, we cross the border.

733
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:43,367
The next day,
you take a bus back.

734
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,067
A thousand.

735
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,289
Just a ride. Across the border.

736
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:00,122
Do you mind?

737
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:04,301
Put it away.

738
00:55:08,827 --> 00:55:10,698
You"ve been in prison, huh?

739
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,570
You"ve got that look.

740
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:16,487
So, I didn"t see those boys
come out of the bathroom.

741
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:18,967
The owners are used
to cleaning up

742
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:21,579
those kinds of messes
all the time anyway.

743
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:23,276
Do you want me to wear this wig?

744
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,148
Do you prefer blondes
or brunettes?

745
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,893
It"s driving me crazy.
It really itches.

746
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:34,809
I think this is going to be fun.

747
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:37,246
I"ve never been to Mexico, if
you can actually believe that.

748
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,292
[in Spanish]
Speak Spanish.

749
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,427
[Neto]
When the officer comes,

750
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:45,646
I want you to smile
and look pretty.

751
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,083
You understand?[Inez] Sure thing.

752
00:55:49,476 --> 00:55:51,870
[border agents chattering]

753
00:55:52,044 --> 00:55:53,611
[agent] Can you open
the trunk, please?

754
00:55:56,091 --> 00:55:58,006
So, I"m thinking that $1,500

755
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,095
sounds like a more
appropriate amount.

756
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:02,576
Yeah, I ain"t paying you
to think.

757
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,232
[clears throat]

758
00:56:09,844 --> 00:56:11,716
You know what?
Let"s make it 2,000.

759
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:13,544
It"s a more even number,
don"t you think?

760
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:15,720
It sounds nicer.
Okay, sweetheart?

761
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,202
[agents chattering]

762
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,813
All the way down.
Yes.

763
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:25,164
[both speaking Spanish]

764
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:46,054
[Neto]
We will spend the night here.

765
00:56:46,228 --> 00:56:48,753
Tomorrow I"ll take you to the
bus station so you can go back.

766
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:50,319
[Latin music playing
in distance]

767
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,973
[service bell dings]

768
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:54,498
So, what are you looking for?

769
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:56,282
I know you"re looking
for something.

770
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,416
I"m looking for my son.

771
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,592
My wife"s boyfriend
took him, went south.

772
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,158
[in Spanish]
Good night.

773
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:04,551
[in Spanish]
Two rooms.

774
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:06,988
We only have one.

775
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:11,036
How much? Forty.

776
00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:15,997
[Inez in English]
So, uh, this boyfriend...

777
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:18,696
You met him? Yeah.

778
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,828
And he"s met you? Mm-hmm.

779
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,657
[Inez] So he knows
you"re looking for him,

780
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:25,093
and you"re
just going to show up?

781
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,617
Yeah.

782
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,925
I mean, don"t you need
some help, maybe,

783
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:32,536
if you don"t mind my asking?

784
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:38,237
I mean, I can arrange
the contact for you.

785
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:40,761
He doesn"t know who I am.

786
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:42,676
Well, how much
is that going to cost?

787
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:44,809
I don"t know.

788
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:47,376
It sounds pretty dangerous.

789
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:49,074
Name your price.

790
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:50,989
Five grand, at least.

791
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:55,559
Goddamn, you"re just gonna
clean me out, aren"t you?

792
00:57:57,038 --> 00:57:58,649
It"s a win-win, if you ask me.

793
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:09,311
Were those in the truck
the whole time?

794
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,704
Yep.

795
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:14,142
What was your plan gonna
be if the border man

796
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:15,535
asked to look through it?

797
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,842
Well, I wasn"t
too worried about him.

798
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:19,626
He was too busy
looking at your tits.

799
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,801
[gun clicks]

800
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:24,588
[Inez] Well, he wouldn"t
have been the first.

801
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:31,464
[sighs]Do you mind if I borrow
a shirt to sleep in?

802
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:33,858
I packed really fast
and I forgot one.

803
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:37,470
My sign is a Pisces. I am such
a Pisces. What sign are you?

804
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:39,777
I was kind of discovered
like Anna Nicole Smith.

805
00:58:39,951 --> 00:58:41,430
I dream about going to Hawaii,

806
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,955
"cause I really wanna open
my own flower shop.

807
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:46,653
"Cause I do like making people
feel good, and I like having fun.

808
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:48,437
You would love my grandmother.

809
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,614
You know why?
Because she doesn"t ever talk.

810
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:54,008
I learned how to knit a little bit
by myself, which I like. I like it.

811
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:56,794
Yeah, I"m not so good at it,
but I"m not sure why,

812
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:58,970
but it"s just never
really stuck with me.

813
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:01,712
Oh, wow, are we here?
Are these them?

814
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:04,279
Ooh, they look like
pretty nice-looking condos.

815
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,021
[Inez] Houston.

816
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,591
Well, I"m originally from Waco.

817
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:14,333
Yeah. [chuckles]

818
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:15,552
That"s right.

819
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,031
So, yeah.

820
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:20,600
So, I have a friend, um,
who lives in Tampico,

821
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:23,081
and she was saying
that there was a...

822
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:25,344
You know, I saw your sign.
That"s what it was.

823
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,346
I saw your sign,
and I remember her saying

824
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,914
something about this guy,
Vincent Rice,

825
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:33,482
who is developing
a community of houses somewhere,

826
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:36,747
and it"s really
going to be great,

827
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:39,880
and that she wanted me
to look into it.

828
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:45,277
You know what?
I think I can do that. Uh-huh.

829
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:47,932
Yeah. Great.
I"ll see you in an hour.

830
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,934
And Vincent"s going
to be there, right?

831
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:52,632
Oh, great! That"s great.
He can!

832
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:53,938
Okay, good.

833
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,855
Good. Okay, thank you.
I appreciate it.

834
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:00,205
Thank you very much.
I"ll see you soon. Bye.

[Vincent]
I"m not gonna kid you, Inez.

836
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:13,697
You seem like
a real smart cookie.

837
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:16,047
The market"s going down,
the peso"s going down.

838
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:17,744
This is the time of opportunity.

839
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:19,920
It"s all upside.
Literally no downside.

840
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:22,357
"You buy low,
you watch it grow."

841
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,795
You know
who said that? No.

842
01:00:24,969 --> 01:00:26,535
Somebody rich.

843
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:27,928
[chuckles] I bet.

844
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:30,104
So, you have children?

845
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:32,498
Oh, not yet.

846
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:35,936
I"ve been thinking about it, but I gotta
convince my boyfriend first, of course.

847
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,024
Boyfriend? Mm-hmm.

848
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,243
Aw.

849
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:41,681
Uh, you live here? No.

850
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,641
No, I live in a small mansion
on the other side of town.

851
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:46,338
Mmm.
Oh, my goodness.

852
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:47,731
They follow you
everywhere you go?

853
01:00:47,905 --> 01:00:49,994
That"s
my sales team.Mmm.

854
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:51,865
Do you mind if I take
a couple pictures?

855
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:53,475
Feel free.

856
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,695
Just to show my boyfriend.
I think he would really...

857
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:57,262
Give me this... really like this place.

858
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:58,655
[in Spanish]

859
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,614
[in English] So...

860
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:04,269
Yeah, I guess you can just
show me the facilities, you know.

861
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:06,967
Playground, clubhouse.

862
01:01:07,141 --> 01:01:08,055
Clubhouse? Yeah.

863
01:01:08,229 --> 01:01:09,578
Follow me.Okay.

01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:22,156
[breathing rapidly]

866
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,219
[Vincent] Up over there
is gonna be the greens.

867
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:44,701
Up top there will be
the new football field.

868
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,572
Of course, over here
will be the casino.

869
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:49,183
Right next to that,
the clubhouse

870
01:01:49,357 --> 01:01:51,272
with, of course,
another pool, a sauna,

871
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:52,970
etcetera,
etcetera, etcetera.[Inez laughs]

872
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:55,059
Oh, I"m sorry.
Did you want one of these?

873
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:58,018
Oh. I never had
one of these before.

874
01:01:58,192 --> 01:01:59,454
You"re
kidding me.Yeah.

875
01:01:59,628 --> 01:02:01,108
How do you do it? Oh, it"s easy.

876
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,283
Just suck.

877
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,155
That"s it.

878
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:07,071
Mmm? [chuckles]Like a chimney.

879
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:08,899
[Vincent smacks lips]

880
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,992
That"s him, right? Yeah.

881
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,951
Okay, so...
[sighs]

882
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,345
...those are the condo
offices right behind him,

883
01:02:20,519 --> 01:02:23,522
and let"s see...

884
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:25,524
There were workers all over.

885
01:02:25,698 --> 01:02:28,092
They don"t look like workers
to me, but they were all leaving.

886
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:31,008
Um, and then here I am,
Miss Motormouth, of course.

887
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:33,227
"Can you show me this?"
and "Can I see that?"

888
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:34,925
"Take me here,"
and blah, blah, blah, blah,

889

01:30:14,713 --> 01:30:16,498
[Neto groaning]

1248
01:30:30,207 --> 01:30:31,426
You see?

1249
01:30:35,517 --> 01:30:37,127
This is what justice looks like.

1250
01:30:48,312 --> 01:30:50,009
Let"s see how your boy is doing.

1251
01:30:54,753 --> 01:30:56,102
[grunts]

1252
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:24,479
[groaning]

1253
01:31:49,895 --> 01:31:51,418
[groaning continues]

1254
01:32:39,945 --> 01:32:41,817
[groaning]

1255
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:00,792
[sniffling]

1256
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:07,059
[prisoners chattering
in distance]

1257
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:39,570
[Neto] Julio,

1258
01:33:39,744 --> 01:33:42,138
I was never the man
you thought I was.

1259
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:45,141
I killed an innocent boy,

1260
01:33:45,315 --> 01:33:47,796
and for that,
you paid the price.

1261
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,235
For all the things I"ve done,

1262
01:33:52,409 --> 01:33:54,498
for all the things
I"m about to do,

1263
01:33:55,891 --> 01:33:57,980
may God have mercy on my soul.

1264
01:34:00,852 --> 01:34:02,811
[groaning]

1265
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:17,608
And now, Judas,
it"s time for you to pay.

1266
01:34:18,783 --> 01:34:20,219
[muffled shouting]
