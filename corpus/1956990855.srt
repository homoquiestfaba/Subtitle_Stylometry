What is it, Sam? I mean,
I'm becoming paranoid!

715
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:31,587
I don't want to be like her!

716
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:39,595
- If you really want to
get to the bottom of this

717
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,076
we can work it through.

718
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:44,644
Break down every detail
that you remember

719
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:47,995
with everything that
you're experiencing now.

720
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:50,998
Or if you'd like
to give it a try,

721
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:53,783
we could regress you.

722
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:58,223
Alex, I want you to just
focus on the pendant.

723
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:00,616
Try to look right through it.

724
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,488
And breathe...

725
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:06,492
And focus on the pendant.

726
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:10,626
Let the pendant bring you back.

727
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:13,499
The pendant is
taking you back.

728
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,502
Back...

729
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:21,507
The pendant is taking you back.

730
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,747
- Mommy!

731
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:46,010
No!

732
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,884
Oh God!

733
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,713
Oh my God!

734
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:56,368
- It's OK. I'm so sorry.

735
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:58,500
I'm so sorry.

736
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,154
Alex, I'm so sorry.

737
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,723
I should have known.
I should have known.

738
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:06,291
Alex, you witnessed your
mother murder your aunt

739
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:08,641
and then she tried to kill you.

740
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,034
Listen.

741
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:11,774
You and I know

742
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:13,863
that you're afraid of
becoming like Evelyn.

743
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:17,606
But I think that
subconsciously, Alex,

744
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:20,740
you think that you are Evelyn

745
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,308
and that you might
have even killed.

746
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,092
- I would never do that, Sam!

747
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:27,268
- No, no. I know.

748
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:29,140
I agree.
- Oh!

749
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,881
- But with all the stress
that you're under right now

750
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:36,799
with Dan, and your mother,
and that brownstone

751
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,237
your mind is just having
a little trouble adjusting.

752
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,239
Now listen, listen.

753
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:43,981
I need you to tell me.

754
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:47,332
Have you had any of these
episodes outside of the house?

755
00:49:47,462 --> 00:49:51,336
- Sam, you're scaring me! I'm
not having a breakdown, Sam!

756
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,512
- You're not having a breakdown.

757
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,949
Now, the Valium's fine, Alex.

758
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,212
But I'd like you to try
something more targeted

759
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,519
to your own anxiety, all right?

760
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:06,873
I want you to take
these for a few days

761
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,267
to see how they work for you.

762
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,921
If it's a fit, I'll
get you a prescription.

763
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:12,792
- OK.

764
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:15,664
- Good.

765
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:19,755
- Thank you.

766
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:21,888
- Listen...

767
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,372
I'm going to make the
arrangements for your mother.

768
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:28,808
I'll take care of that.

769
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:31,898
And I will get you through
this. I promise you.

770
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,595
I promise you.

771
00:50:36,555 --> 00:50:37,817
- Thank you.

772
00:50:49,742 --> 00:50:52,049
- What were you trying to say?

773
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:54,486
[ Knocking ]

774
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,706
- Alex! Alex!

775
00:50:57,837 --> 00:51:00,100
Alex! What the
hell are you doing?

776
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:03,625
The building inspector's waiting
for you downstairs, remember?

777
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:06,585
- Oh my God. Um, just
stall him or something.

778
00:51:06,715 --> 00:51:08,891
- OK, but hurry up!

779
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:10,023
- Ah...

780
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:17,030
Two...

781
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,988
- I've got your current
building permits

782
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,382
as well as the voided one
that was filed in '85.

783
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:22,992
These are standard forms.

784
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,082
- Wait. Did you say '85?
What was it for?

785
00:51:25,212 --> 00:51:27,040
- Well, don't know.

786
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,957
But it's the same contractor
you're using now.

787
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,180
- Oh my God.

788
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,182
It was you!

789
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:39,400
It was you, you murderer!

790
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:40,401
You murderer!

791
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:41,968
- What's wrong with you?

792
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,710
- Thought you could void
the permits to hide yourself?

793
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,538
You were wrong!
- What's she talking about?

794
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,670
- Alex, calm down.
He has nothing--

795
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,846
- Was it for the money?
The hidden room?

796
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:53,284
Is that why you took advantage
of my mentally-ill mother

797
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:54,502
and you murdered my aunt?

798
00:51:54,633 --> 00:51:56,200
I should murder you myself!

799
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,810
- Go ahead, murder me!

800
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,768
Somebody call the cops.
This woman's nuts!

801
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:01,248
She needs to be locked up.

802
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:02,597
- Yeah, call the cops!

803
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:04,947
- You see this? I had
emergency heart surgery.

804
00:52:05,078 --> 00:52:07,298
I was in the hospital the
week your aunt was murdered.

805
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:09,691
Don't believe me?
Check the hospital records.

806
00:52:09,822 --> 00:52:11,519
- Why not tell me
you were here before?

807
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,130
- Because I didn't
want to dredge up

808
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,261
any bad memories for you.

809
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,220
You know what? You're psychotic.

810
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:17,264
I quit.

811
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:18,526
- Ed, come on! Come on!

812
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:20,746
- Oh, that's good! Go after him!

813
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:23,270
I saw you guys conspiring!
I heard the whispering!

814
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:24,706
- OK, you need to get a grip!

815
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,534
Ed was helping us off the books!

816
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,275
Dan cancelled part
of his payment.

817
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:30,756
I figured you already had
too much to worry about

818
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:31,844
so I didn't tell you!

819
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,412
- I didn't know! I didn't...

820
00:52:34,542 --> 00:52:36,022
- Alex,

821
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,590
you need to pull
yourself together.

822
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,984
- You saw her drawings,
my aunt's murder.

823
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:44,465
In some of them she drew a man.

824
00:52:44,596 --> 00:52:46,859
I want to know if
you think he's real.

825
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:49,557
- You're asking me if I believe
Evelyn murdered your aunt?

826
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,342
- Do you think
someone else was there?

827
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:52,560
- I don't think there was.

828
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:54,475
I think she drew him
to forgive herself.

829
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:56,173
- Are you saying
she made it up?

830
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:58,131
- No, no. Her reality split.

831
00:52:58,262 --> 00:53:00,307
She truly believed
there was someone else

832
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:01,787
when her mind allowed her to.

833
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:03,745
When it didn't, she saw
herself as the killer.

834
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:09,925
A mental break is like two
realities overlapping,

835
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:12,754
constantly weaving,
so they both seem real.

836
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:15,279
- Two realities? What causes it?

837
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:18,020
- Genetics, severe trauma,
any number of things.

838
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,979
I can tell you this:

839
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:22,982
I don't believe her true break
occurred until after the murder.

840
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,465
Give me a second.
I want to show you something.

841
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:30,990
- I'm not like her.

842
00:53:33,819 --> 00:53:35,212
I'm not like her.

843
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:51,750
Shouldn't there be another
index card up there?

844
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,055
Or did sleeping with me

845
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:55,101
not give you enough
insight into my mother?

846
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,190
- Alexandra, it's
not what you think.

847
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:58,974
Alex, please wait!

848
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,759
- Look, just
stay away from me!

849
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:03,196
- Alex, let me
explain what you saw.

850
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:06,547
It's a map of your mother's
mind. How she processed things.

851
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,201
Her two realities.

852
00:54:15,077 --> 00:54:18,298
Your last visit with her
triggered something.

853
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:21,823
The key to that night, the one
thing she'd never drawn.

854
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,740
This is the "why".
You must want to know.

855
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:27,612
- No, I don't want to know!

856
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:29,527
She was insane, all right?

857
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:32,225
- OK, look, I'm sorry.

858
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:35,707
Look, I won't
pursue it either.

859
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:40,799
You're a beautiful, intelligent
woman who I want to get to know,

860
00:54:40,929 --> 00:54:42,017
not analyze.

861
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,198
You have to believe I didn't
become intimate with you

862
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,199
for any other reason.

863
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:55,074
- I don't know. I just don't
want to see you anymore.

864
00:54:59,861 --> 00:55:00,993
Hey, Sam.

865
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:03,125
- Oh, hi. I was just
coming to see you.

866
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,518
- Yeah? What's up?

867
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,697
These are her things, huh?

868
00:55:09,828 --> 00:55:12,265
- The sanitarium handed
them over to me and...

869
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:15,094
I'm sorry. I didn't know how
to prepare you for this.

870
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:41,642
OK...

871
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:43,296
What's happening here?

872
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:45,603
- Nothing. It's fine, it's fine.

873
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,431
- Stop, stop.

874
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:48,954
Why don't I take these?

875
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:51,565
I don't think this is a
good idea for you right now.

876
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,654
- No, I got it.
It's fine, it's fine.

877
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,222
I'm tired.

878
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,441
I got it.

879
00:55:58,877 --> 00:55:59,573
- OK.

880
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:06,363
Alex...

881
00:56:08,016 --> 00:56:09,278
Get some rest, OK?

882
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:10,541
I'll see you tomorrow.

883
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:56,978
- OK, so just make sure
these are taken care of

884
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:59,328
and I guess we
can fudge the rest.

885
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:00,939
There you go.

886
00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:02,419
- Sure.

887
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:16,476
- All right, here's
what I got to say.

888
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:24,049
I was way out of line,
and I'm truly sorry for that.

889
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:27,139

1083
