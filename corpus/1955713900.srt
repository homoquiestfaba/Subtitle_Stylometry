* WITH ME

1110
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:37,467
* ONCE UPON A TIME

1111
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:43,273
* WE WERE FLYING

1112
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,476
* ONCE UPON A TIME

1113
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:52,116
* WE WERE FREE

1114
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:55,785
* LIFE ONCE LET US GO

1115
01:05:55,819 --> 01:06:00,490
* AS FAR AS WE COULD GO

1116
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:03,527
* ALWAYS REMEMBER

1117
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,531
* ONCE UPON A TIME

1118
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:12,036
* WITH ME

1119
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:14,338
* COME AWAY

1120
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:15,839
* COME AWAY

1121
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:21,111
* AND YOUR HEART
WILL UNDERSTAND *

1122
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:23,213
* YESTERDAY

1123
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:25,049
* FLIES AWAY

1124
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:30,120
* BUT TOMORROW'S
IN YOUR HAND *

1125
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,356
* COME AWAY

1126
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,191
* COME AWAY

1127
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:38,962
* THERE'S A PLACE
THAT IT CAN BE *

1128
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,465
* THAT YOU CAN BE LIKE

1129
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:48,638
* ONCE UPON A TIME

1130
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:52,509
* ONCE AGAINST THE ODDS

1131
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:57,481
* WE WERE WINNERS

1132
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:06,556
* WE WERE ALL WE DREAMED
WE COULD BE *

1133
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:10,994
* YOU TOUCHED
NIGHT AND DAY *

1134
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:16,266
* AND MADE THEM GO OUR WAY

1135
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,404
* ONCE UPON A TIME

1136
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:24,541
* WITH ME

1137
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:30,046
* WHEN WE LIVED OUR LIVES

1138
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:35,018
* LIKE A STORY

1139
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,855
* AND THE STORY ENDS

1140
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:44,528
* WHAT WILL BE?

1141
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:48,232
* WHERE THIS LIFE WILL GO

1142
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:52,469
* I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW

1143
01:07:52,502 --> 01:08:00,377
* PLEASE DON'T FORGET
THAT ONCE UPON A TIME *

1144
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,312
* WITH ME

1145
01:08:02,346 --> 01:08:04,414
* COME AWAY

1146
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:09,386
* AND YOUR HEART
WILL UNDERSTAND *

1147
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,421
* YESTERDAY

1148
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,657
* FLIES AWAY

1149
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:19,062
* BUT TOMORROW'S
IN YOUR HAND *

1150
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,964
* COME AWAY

1151
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:23,267
* COME AWAY

1152
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,904
* THERE'S A PLACE
THAT IT CAN BE *

1153
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,141
* AND YOU CAN BE LIKE

1154
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:34,911

1155
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,913
* WITH ME

1156
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:42,352
* WHEN ONE STORY ENDS

1157
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:47,957
* THERE'S ANOTHER

1158
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:51,628
* IT'S ALL UP TO US

1159
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:57,701
* DON'T YOU SEE?

1160
01:08:57,734 --> 01:09:02,272
* YOU SAY LET'S BEGIN

1161
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:07,211
* AND I SAY ONCE AGAIN

1162
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:10,547
* AND YOU'LL FIND IT'S NOT

1163
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:14,851
* ONCE UPON A TIME

1164
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,554
* BUT HERE AND NOW

1165
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:24,961

1166
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,896
* COME AWAY

1167
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:32,035
* AND YOUR HEART
WILL UNDERSTAND *

1168
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:33,970
* YESTERDAY

1169
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,473
* FLIES AWAY

1170
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:41,378

IN YOUR HAND *

1171
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,680
