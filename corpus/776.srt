00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,399
<i>Another year,
a brand new diary.</i>

2
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,793
<i>Once again I was summoned,
kicking and screaming,</i>

3
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,871
<i>to my mother's turkey curry buffet,</i>

4
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,953
<i>where I've had some of the most
shaming experiences of my life.</i>

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,436
<i>Hello, darling.</i>

6
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,429
<i>Lovely to see you.</i>

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,636
<i>It was, as usual, crammed full</i>

8
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,678
<i>with some of the most dangerous perverts
In the UK,</i>

9
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,752
<i>disguised as close, personal friends
of my parents.</i>

10
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,672
- Hello, Bridget.
- Hello, Una.

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,149
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Love the jumper.

12
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,790
- I prefer what's underneath it.
- Uncle Geoffrey!

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,076
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello.

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,838
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Dad. How's it going?

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,513
I wish I was dead.

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,118
<i>But this year,
there was one crucial difference.</i>

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,511
- Nice jumper.
- My mother's taste never falters.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,271
Never.

19
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,434
<i>You always wonder how it's going
to work out at the end of the story.</i>

20
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,716
<i>Marla and Captain Von Trapp,</i>

21
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,632
<i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,</i>

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,758
<i>Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones.</i>

23
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,117
<i>I've found my happy ending at last.</i>

24
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,034
<i>And nothing in the world can spoil it.</i>

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,558
<i>Well, almost nothing.</i>

26
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,757
<i>Bridget Jones,
what the fuck are you doling?</i>

27
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,275
- I, I can't see anywhere soft to land.
- How about on your arse?

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,716
Bridget, unless you want to get sacked
at 6,000 feet,

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,917
you will be on your way
in exactly three seconds.

30
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,719
Three, two, one... cue Bridget.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,398
<i>Skydiving:</i>

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,155
<i>A dangerous bane to the countryside
and emergency services,</i>

33
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,392
<i>or a safe and exhilarating hobby?</i>

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,632
<i>Well... let's see, shall we?</i>

35
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,109
Go. Jump.

36
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,874
For Christ’s sakes, go!

37
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,238
<i>- She's out. Unit Two, you got her?
- We see her.</i>

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,994
<i>Bridget, open the chute.</i>

39
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,031
<i>Open it.</i>

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,710
Open your fucking parachute!

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
<i>Pull the thingy or you will die!</i>

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,789
Oh.

43
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,431
<i>Honestly,
you forget just one teeny, weeny detail</i>

44
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,795
<i>and everyone treats you like an idiot.</i>

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,508
<i># Nobody does it better</i>

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,438
<i># Makes me feel sad for the rest</i>

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,958
<i># Nobody does it</i>

48
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,511
<i># Half as good as you</i>

49
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,955
<i># Baby, baby</i>

50
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,955
<i># Darling, you're the best</i>

51
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,028
<i># Baby, you're the best...</i>

52
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,398
<i>Where was I?
Oh, yes... Mark Darcy.</i>

53
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,031
<i>The question is: What happens
after you walk off into the sunset?</i>

54
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,079
Bridget?
Earth to Bridget Sodding Jones.

55
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,158
<i>Bridget, you're on.
You're live.</i>

56
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,673
<i>Well, this is Bridget Jones
for Sit Up Britain,</i>

57
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,150
reporting to you
from a big vat of excrement.

58
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,075
Give me a close-up of the porker.

59
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,152
<i>Who cares about
the odd professional hiccup?</i>

60
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,629
<i>I've been in a functional relationship</i>

61
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,872
<i>with an adult male
for six wonderful weeks,</i>

62
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,555
<i>four fabulous days
and seven precious hours.</i>

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,957
<i>Or to put it another way,
71 ecstatic shags.</i>

64
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,669
<i>He's given up being snooty,
and I've given up smoking.</i>

65
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,878
<i>- # Loving you...
- Well, he thinks I have anyway,</i>

66
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,031
<i>which is practically the same thing.</i>

67
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,350
<i># ... a dream come true...</i>

68
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,351
<i>Mark Darcy is perfect.</i>

69
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,990
<i>Not a fuckwit, alcoholic, workaholic,
pervert or megalomaniac,</i>

70
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,958
<i>but total sex god
and human rights lawyer.</i>

71
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,759
<i>He is a miracle, really.</i>

72
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,388
<i>Bridget, will you stop?</i>

73
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,120
Stop staring at me.
Go and find something to do.

74
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,998
Sorry.

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,276
<i># La la la la la...</i>

76
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,115
<i>So, as you can see,
the incredible truth is</i>

77
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,192
<i>the wilderness years are over.</i>

78
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,592
<i>Bridget Jones is a love pariah no more.</i>

79
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,510
Morning, Bridget. Late again.

80
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,876
Yes. Sorry.

81
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,635
I was in bed with my boyfriend.

82
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,075
He's a human rights lawyer, you know.

83
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,071
Yes, we know.

84
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,709
<i>I cannot believe how fantastic
shagging was last night.</i>

85
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,311
<i>Maybe I'll ring him.</i>

86
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,193
<i>No, no...</i>

87
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,273
<i>Obviously it's important to tell one's
boyfriend how nice he looks naked,</i>

88
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,955
<i>but I have crucial,
Pulitzer Prize winning journalism to do.</i>

89
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,113
<i>Hello?</i>

90
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,556
It's me. Just wondered how you are.

91
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,473
<i>I'm fine, thanks.
Everything all right with you?</i>

92
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,631
Fine, though, er...

93
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,119
I've just had a rather graphic
shag flashback.

94
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,912
And you do have
a genuinely gorgeous bottom.

95
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,998
Thank you.

96
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,789
I'm with the Mexican ambassador,
the head of Amnesty International

97
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,872
and the Undersecretary
for Trade and Industry.

98
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,836
And you're on speakerphone.

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,195
Oh. Right, well...

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,749
I'm quite busy
with important stuff too...

101
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,118
Bridget, we're waiting for that tape
about Tom, the happy hamster.

102
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,750
<i>- I'll call when I've finished.
- Excellent.</i>

103
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,230
And Richard wants to see you
about that crap skydiving report.

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,550
Oh, fuck.

105
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,793
<i>Oh, dear. Is this the end of my career?</i>

106
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,471
<i>No, It can't be.</i>

107
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,316
<i>I will fight this. I am a journalist of
the highest standards and integrity.</i>

108
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,952
<i>This is Bridget Jones
reporting from a big vat of excrement.</i>

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,510
Look, I never said I could skydive
and I'm terrified of heights,

110
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,276
- so it was really hard to concentrate.
- Be quiet. They loved it upstairs.

111
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,149
Loved it. And they want us to come up
with another regular spot for you.

112
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,153
Oh, my God. That's...

113
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,280
- I won't let you down, Richard.
- Precisely.

114
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,115
<i>...my friends' motto was "When in Rome,
do as many Romans as you can. "</i>

115
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,990
<i>But if your tastes are marginally
more highbrow, I also have tips.</i>

116
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,958
<i>Forget the Forum,
definitely forget the Coliseum,</i>

117
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,554
<i>no fun now they can't
slaughter Christians.</i>

118
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,350
<i>Forget the Sistine Chapel, first example
of a poof interior designer gone mad...</i>

119
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,832
What is Daniel Oleaver
doing on the television?

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,276
<i>It's called The Smooth Guide.
"Making culture bearable".</i>

121
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,116
<i>...equally serene and equally beautiful
Professore Giovana Dabrache.</i>

122
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,475
<i>Who is about to show me her diptych.</i>

123
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,710
Same old creep.

124
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,791
Oh. Shame.

125
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,474
He always speaks very warmly of you.

126
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,119
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

127
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,748
How about we go out
for a bite to eat tonight?

128
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,912
Oh. Can’t.
I have to go out with my boyfriend.

129
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,196
- He's a human rights lawyer.
- I know.

130
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,396
I'm meeting him for a romantic supper.

131
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,879
<i>Oh.</i>

132
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,990
<i>- Bridget Jones.
- Bridget, It's Mark.</i>

133
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,879
Oh. I was just talking about you.

134
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm running late.
Do you want me to cancel?

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,558
<i>- Oh. No, that's fine.
- Are you sure?</i>

136
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,836
Be as late as you like.

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,830
Chuck him, while you're not pregnant
with his unwanted child.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,752
I only said he was working late.

139
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,151
In one hour, he'll be coming
in his secretary's mouth

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,993
while he rings to say
what he wants for starters.

141
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,152
<i>Friends spend years
finding you a boyfriend,</i>

142
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,231
<i>then instantly tell you to dump him.</i>

143
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,756
Even if he isn't shagging her already,
he's thinking about it.

144
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,959
A man dating a woman with large breasts
will bed one with small breasts.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,953
Rubbish. Mark's above all that nonsense.

146
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,873
Jellyfisher alert. Jellyfisher alert.

147
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,754
<i>Janey Osborne.
Talking to her is like swimming in a sea</i>

148
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,037
<i>and being stung repeatedly
by an enormous jellyfish.</i>

149
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,716
Bridget. How's it going
with that divine man of yours?

150
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,678
You must be so pleased
to have a boyfriend at last.

151
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,717
<i>First jellyfish of the evening.</i>

152
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,110
Is he taking you
to the Law Council Dinner?

153
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,510
Oh. Well, I'm sure he's just forgotten.

154
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,035
Better start slimming into that dress.

155
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,352
He's given you the night off
to cheer up your single friends. Sweet.

156
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,196
Actually, he's got a big case on, trying
to get everyone in Mexico out of prison.

157
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,033
We're meeting for a very late
romantic dinner.

158
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,509
Really? That's so odd,

159
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,389
'cause I saw him an hour ago going
into his house with Rebecca Gillies.

160
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,597
She's only 22.
She's got legs up to here.

161
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,990
And Daddy owns half of Australia.

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,118
See ya, babes.

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,393
Who is Rebecca Gillies? What's she doing
going into my boyfriend's house?

164
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,711
Where he never asks me.
And with legs up to here?

165
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,509
- My legs only come up to there.
- You have fine legs.

166
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,591
Climber’s legs.

167
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,354
I say go over there and ask him,
straight out,

168
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,398
are you or are you not
sleeping with Rebecca Gillies?

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,348
- If he says...
- I won't dignify that with an answer...

170
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,431
Then you know he's shagging her.

171
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,750
<i># All that I have
Is all that you've given...</i>

172
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,913
<i>It's all about confidence and
trust. Mark would never betray me.</i>

173
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,311
<i>Everything will be lovely
and we'll have sex in the kitchen.</i>

174
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,389
- Oh, God.
- I'm coming.

175
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,949
<i>Oh, God! What is that?</i>

176
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,554
Two seconds,
I'll be straight down.

177
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,631
<i>Who is that?</i>

178
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
<i># ... I find you lied</i>

179
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,671
<i># And I can't believe it's true</i>

180
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,588
<i># Wrapped in her arms
I see you across the street</i>

181
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,069
<i># I see you across the street</i>

182
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,395
<i># And I can't help but wonder
If she knows what's going on</i>

183
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,719
<i># You talk of love
But don't know how it feels</i>

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,434
<i># When you realise</i>

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,992
<i># You're not the only one</i>

186
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,752
Let's get on with it.

187
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,992
<i># ... oh, you better stop</i>

188
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,469
<i>- # Stop
- # Before</i>

189
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,200
<i># You tear me all apart</i>

190
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,316
<i># You better stop</i>

191
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,472
<i>- # Stop...
- You are a very demanding man.</i>

192
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,598
<i># ... you go and break my heart...</i>

193
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,478
Bridget Jones.

194
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,676
No, I'm Bridget Jones.

195
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,559
- That's what I meant.
- You must be...

196
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,951
Rebecca Gillies. I've been
so looking forward to meeting you

197
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,112
- after everything Mark's told me.
- Why? What's he said?

198
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,276
- Where is Mark?
- Actually, er...

199
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,159
- Becky, who is it?
- Becky?

200
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,788
- Right.
- Great.

201
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,590
- Right...
- Bridget.

202
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,751
Hello, Mark.

203
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,835
Hello...

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,878
lawyers who work with Mark.

205
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,076
Good evening.

206
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,198
Everything under control, I see.

207
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,715
Um... Excellent graph.

208
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,869
- Lovely legs.
- Thank you.

209
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,030
I am so sorry.

210
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,749
I thought...
Oh, I don't know what I thought.

211
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,831
Now you're really angry with me.

212
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,912
- No, I'm not.
- It's OK, you can say if you are.

213
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,356
- It's not the end of the world.
- I'll get you a glass of wine.

214
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,074
The thing is I ran into Janey Osborne,

215
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,155
who said she'd just seen you
with this girl, with really long legs,

216
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,233
and Shazzer and Jude said
I should get over here straightaway.

217
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,075
Following the orders of the dating
war command, you executed a raid.

218
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,913
- You are angry.
- I'm not, just disappointed.

219
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,595
Disappointed?
Oh, God, that's worse than angry.

220
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,036
I'm just disappointed
I can't take you home this instant.

221
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,396
Oh.
What about all those lawyers?

222
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,553
Oh, plenty of time to butter them up
at the Law Council Dinner next Friday.

223
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,555
Don't want to go, do you?

224
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,392
I'd love to.

225
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,635
<i>Oh, stupid Bridget, stupid friends.</i>

226
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
<i>Wonderful, loyal Mark Darcy...</i>

227
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,314
<i>...who loves me just the way I am.</i>

228
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,392
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

229
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,869
Why are you dancing around in that tent?

230
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,433
Because I don't want you to see
any of my wobbly bits.

231
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,388
That's pointless, because I have
a very high regard for your wobbly bits

232
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,471
in all circumstances.

233
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,551
- Really?
- Absolutely.

234
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,435
I think it's high time
we had another look.

235
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,439
<i># Yeah</i>

236
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,791
<i># Are you digging on me?</i>

237
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,678
<i># Yeah</i>

238
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,949
<i># I'm digging on you, now, baby</i>

239
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,314
<i># Yeah</i>

240
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,750
<i># Do you want a little bit of my love?</i>

241
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,909
<i># Yeah...</i>

242
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,709
<i>He really is very, very, very nice.</i>

243
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,991
<i># All the time I knew</i>

244
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,718
<i># That you loved me</i>

245
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,238
<i># And you promised me...</i>

246
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,391
I miss you too.

247
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,395
<i># That you would be my only man</i>

248
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,709
<i># Yeah</i>

249
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,111
<i># Are you digging on me?</i>

250
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,998
<i>I've never been happier
In my entire life.</i>

251
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,232
<i>However, must not obsess or fantasise.</i>

252
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,711
<i>Bridget Darcy.</i>

253
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,836
<i>Mrs Darcy.</i>

254
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,036
<i>Mr and Mrs Darcy.</i>

255
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,509
<i>Lord and Lady Darcy.</i>

256
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,072
<i>Wonder what Mark Darcy
would be like as a father.</i>

257
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,515
<i>To his children, I mean, not to me.</i>

258
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,478
<i>That would be a weird,
Oedipus-like thought.</i>

259
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,554
<i>At last, life is on track.</i>

260
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,110
<i>Bridget Jones: Fiancée, wife...</i>

261
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,633
<i>mother.</i>

262
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,711
Bugger.

263
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,350
Ever fancied doing it in the dark
with a total stranger?

264
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,308
All right, perhaps not a total stranger.

265
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,753
Back off, Oleaver, or I'll report you
to a sexual harassment tribunal.

266
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,319
I'm a serious journalist.

267
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,835
Is that your most serious skirt, Jones?

268
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,479
Oh...

269
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,437
Do you like it?

270
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,830
I thought you hated television.

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,151
I hate watching television.
Being on it is... Hello there.

272
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,231
...entirely different.

273
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,234
Daniel, thought the Madrid piece
was outstanding, really original.

274
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,188
Cheers, Jeremy. Appreciate that.
We had to work really hard on that one.

275
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,352
Tosser. Talking of which,
how is Mark Darcy?

276
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,836
- You still...?
- Yes, I am.

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,309
And I intend to be for a very long time.

278
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,029
Good. You know what a fan I am
of any woman married to Mark Darcy.

279
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,317
- That's not funny.
- Seriously, though, Jones,

280
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,153
speaking purely unselfishly,
I worry about you.

281
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,593
You do know that it's a fact that
most lawyer's wives die of boredom?

282
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,636
And what about you?
Still shagging anything that moves?

283
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,913
As a matter of fact, no.
No shagging whatsoever.

284
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,196
I'm in shag therapy.

285
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,353
It turns out I have a problem. I go
to meetings, talk about my feelings.

286
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,476
Hug people who smell.

287
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,234
- I don't believe you.
- I'm trying...

288
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,551
...to be a better man, Bridge,

289
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,518
so that the next time
a better woman comes along,

290
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,592
I won't make a pig's ear of it.

291
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,551
Daniel. Meeting?

292
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,151
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

293
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,791
Very good hair, Jones.

294
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,510
By the way, um, you're not free
for dinner tonight, are you?

295
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,229
No, I'm not.
I'm going to the Law Council Dinner.

296
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,755
It's a very important evening.

297
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,392
I can't wear that.

298
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,599
Bridge, do you want to get married and
have babies before you become barren?

299
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,829
Trust me...

300
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,754
<i>Magda: My only grown-up
friend. Married to Mark's partner.</i>

301
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,629
<i>She actually got engaged
on the night of the Law Council Dinner.</i>

302
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,711
Try it with the dress.

303
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,199
Oh, my God!

304
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,114
Remember, we are trying to reduce
your body size by 15 per cent.

305
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,477
You hold the front, I'll hold the back.
One, two, three...

306
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,799
What's going on in there?

307
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,318
Not too bad, actually.

308
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,878
Tra-la!

309
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,998
Fantastic.

310
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,277
Right, let us begin.

311
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,433
I am going to make you into a princess.

312
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,669
Goody.

313
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,389
<i>Nothing like being
In the hands of a total genius.</i>

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,752
Wow.

315
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,433
<i>- Whatever you do...
- Bugger it.</i>

316
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,556
<i>...don't iron your hair.</i>

317
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,436
It's a lot worse than I thought.

318
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,591
We could flatten it with Brylcreem.

319
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,035
What about a wig? Lawyers love wigs.

320
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,352
- I preferred you in the gold.
- No, whatever you do, not the gold.

321
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,116
Great. I'm late with mad hair and can
barely breathe in scary knickers.

322
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,716
<i># La la la
La la la la la...</i>

323
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,314
<i>Oh, God. I'm very worried.</i>

324
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,349
<i>What if someone says "Bridget Jones,
get out of here, you are ridiculous"?</i>

325
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,032
<i>Stop it.</i>

326
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,398
<i>The most important thing, of course,
Is to look absolutely wonderful</i>

327
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,120
<i>and make a magnificent entrance.</i>

328
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,398
<i># I just can't get you out of my head...</i>

329
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,912
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

330
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,234
- Hello.
- I think you should go to the ladies.

331
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,914
But I went before I left home.

332
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,472
Trust me on this one.

333
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,792
Oh.

334
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,871
Not good.

335
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,755
<i>All right, tiny make-up mistake,</i>

336
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,630
<i>but I always have wit and conversation
to fall back on.</i>

337
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,312
Thank you.

338
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,196
- Bridget.
- Hello.

339
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,435
Derek, Horatio, Camilla.

340
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,672
- Horatio?
- Yes, Horatio.

341
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,469
Horatio was just saying
he's totally against charitable giving.

342
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,072
- What?
- Well, obviously you don't mean it.

343
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,597
Absolutely. Do you think it's helpful
to give a beggar fifty pence?

344
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,672
- Maybe he's just hungry.
- Don't be so naive.

345
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,549
The people you see outside the tube
every day are there by choice.

346
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,598
- End of story.
- Oh, no, it's not.

347
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,274
Some people
have terrible personal problems,

348
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,150
and other people might have lost their
family in some tragic ferry disaster.

349
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,835
And some people are just plain hopeless.

350
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,676
Honestly, this is the sort of rubbish
you'd expect from fat, balding

351
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,631
Tory, Home Counties,
upper-middle-class twits.

352
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,594
Yeah, very good.
Tested my resolve.

353
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,678
How did I do?

354
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,559
You seem to have made
quite an impression.

355
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,470
I've put you next to Giles Benwick.

356
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,916
- Oh, I'm not sitting next to you?
- No. He's terribly nice,

357
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,550
but his wife's just run off
with one of the partners.

358
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,439
He probably won't mention it,
but you should know.

359
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,353
I always knew she was out of my league.

360
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:58,390
You see, there's the high-fliers,
like Annabel and Mark Darcy

361
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,111
and there's the gorgeous girls,
like Rebecca there

362
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,635
and there's the rest of us.

363
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,320
Like you and me, you mean?

364
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,436
Absolutely.

365
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,637
I mean, look at the state of us.

366
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,996
You and me stumbled into the VIP room
by mistake

367
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,596
and it's only a matter of moments
before they show us the door.

368
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,480
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
let the quiz begin.

369
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,556
Oh, goody. I love quizzes.

370
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,710
All those years of playing
Trivial Pursuits are about to pay off.

371
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,153
Now I want to see your hands
poised over those bells. Ready?

372
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,869
Here we go. What are something
called "customary freeholds"?

373
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,112
Superior copyhold.

374
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,474
Yes.

375
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,279
What is the correct grace
used in the Inner Temple

376
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,750
for the second mooting night
of Michaelmas term?

377
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,913
<i>Amas bibendo... fructis.</i>

378
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,197
Jolly good.
What is an overreaching conveyance?

379
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,432
What is rack-rent?
When was breach of promise abolished?

380
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>Define "damnum sentit dominus".</i>

381
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,669
<i>Translate "reddendo singula singulis"
into Ancient Greek.</i>

382
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,956
I believe this is the answer.

383
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,269
<i>Hippodamoi credemnon louestai.</i>

384
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,432
Absolutely correct.

385
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,835
Now, for our final
and deciding round,

386
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,436
the category is contemporary culture.

387
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,476
Who did the design
for Princess Diana's wedding dress?

388
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,869
The Emmanuels.

389
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,349
- Correct.
- Excellent, Bridget.

390
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,432
Name the character in Footballers' Wives

391
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,118
who, in one memorable episode,
set fire to her own breasts.

392
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,599
Chardonnay.

393
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,671
Correct.

394
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,797
At this point,
there are only two tables in contention

395
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,315
and only one question left.

396
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,632
What was the name of Madonna's
first UK single?

397
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,109
<i>Lucky Star.</i>

398
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,352
- Sorry, I didn't quite hear.
- Are you sure?

399
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,478
<i>- Wasn't it Holliday?
- No, everyone thinks it is,</i>

400
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,789
but it's not.

401
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,838
My entire life has been leading up
to this very moment.

402
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,993
Take that knife, slice off my head
and boil it if I'm wrong.

403
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,639
<i>The correct answer is Lucky Star.</i>

404
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,990
No.

405
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,833
<i>- The correct answer is...
- Is it Holliday?</i>

406
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,878
<i>Holliday, indeed, yes.</i>

407
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,636
The winners of
the 42nd Annual Law Council Quiz are...

408
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,870
the Legal Eagles.

409
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,398
- Lovely to see you, Bridget.
- Oh, thanks, Rebecca.

410
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,471
Good night.

411
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,034
Why didn't you speak to me all night?

412
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,430
That's the point of those dinners.

413
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,115
But you talked to Rebecca.
And you talked to Horatio.

414
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,311
I'll never fit in with your friends.

415
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,519
Not if you go on calling everyone
"balding, upper-middle-class twits".

416
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,752
Well, they were balding,
upper-middle-class twits.

417
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,990
Except for the ones who had hair.

418
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,269
I suppose you agree with them
that poor people deserve to be poor?

419
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,351
Don't be ridiculous.

420
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,035
- So now I'm ridiculous?
- Yes, tonight you were a little.

421
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,555
Well, tonight you were an arrogant arse.

422
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,873
I think I may have
made a mistake inviting you

423
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,474
and your folding underpants
into my life.

424
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,191
Good night.

425
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,116
If you had asked me tonight,

426
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,188
I'd have said no, anyway.

427
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,272
Asked you what?

428
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,954
Bridget?

429
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,031
Asked you what?

430
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,155
<i>Oh, God, I've done it.</i>

431
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,356
<i>I've gone and done it.</i>

432
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,433
<i>One minute, you're closer to someone
than anyone in the whole world,</i>

433
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,558
<i>next minute,
you're never going to see them again.</i>

434
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,348
<i>If you have a message for
Mark Darcy, please speak after the tone.</i>

435
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,753
Hello, it's me.
I'm really, really sorry...

436
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,670
Sorry, it's the door.

437
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,310
Don't go away, I have something
really, really important to say.

438
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,314
<i>- Yes, who is it?
- It's me.</i>

439
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,119
<i>- Mark.
- Oh, right.</i>

440
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,396
Er, just a moment.

441
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,112
I'm on the phone.

442
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,596
You're outside.

443
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,596
Look, er...

444
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,231
I'll ring you later.

445
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,916
Unless you've come to chuck me
once and for all.

446
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,271
In which case,

447
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,479
bye and thank you,
and... sorry.

448
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,236
Oh, God, please don't chuck me.

449
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,994
If you have chucked me,
please change your mind,

450
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,116
I'll behave much better in future.

451
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,669
<i>On the other hand, if you haven't,</i>

452
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,230
please behave better
next time we go out. Stuck-up snob.

453
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,839
What do you want?

454
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,833
I'd like to come up.
You are, after all, my girlfriend.

455
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,197
Even though I shouted at you
and called you an arrogant arse?

456
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,511
Unfortunately, yes.
You see, the problematic thing is...

457
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,511
I love you.

458
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,833
W-what?

459
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,196
- I said I love you.
- I'm sorry, I missed that again.

460
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,237
I said I love you, for God's sake!

461
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,999
All right, no need to shout.

462
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,116
I'll come down and let you in.

463
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,588
You might be needing this in the future.

464
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,471
He said he loves me.

465
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,474
<i>- He said he loves you?
- He said he loves me.</i>

466
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,394
- Right, where is he now?
- He's in the bedroom.

467
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,471
Go back in there, Bridge,

468
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,679
and whatever you do,
act completely nonchalant.

469
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,828
Bridget, you're staring at me again.

470
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,033
Sorry.

471
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,837
Listen, I know this evening
didn't go exactly as planned,

472
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,429
but there was a very important question
I wanted to ask you tonight.

473
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,749
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

474
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,791
I've actually been meaning
to ask this for quite some time.

475
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,669
I've just never really found
the right way to put it.

476
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,951
Darling Bridget...

477
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,118
...would you...

478
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,788
...like to go on a skiing mini-break?

479
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,553
Yes!

480
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,875
<i># What the world...</i>

481
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,349
<i>This is not just a mini-break.</i>

482
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,637
<i>This is a holiday in heaven.</i>

483
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,799
<i>Told a tiny lie about being
an extremely experienced skier.</i>

484
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,399
<i>But, honestly, how hard can it be?</i>

485
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,356
- Ah.
- Shall we?

486
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,314
<i>[Bridget[
I know I'm going to like skiing a lot.</i>

487
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,199
<i>Very romantic, very relaxing.</i>

488
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,238
- Bar going up.
- No. What? Why?

489
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,038
Um...

490
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,079
Er...

491
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,151
Oh. Oh, God.

492
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,798
Oh, God. Oh.

493
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,318
Ah.

494
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,078
Bridget.

495
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,516
Rebecca. What are you doing here?

496
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,911
- Didn't Mark tell you we were coming?
- No, he didn't.

497
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,150
It was me who recommended the place.

498
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,959
- I've been coming since I was 11.
- Really?

499
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,633
<i>Three whole years.</i>

500
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,916
Come on, up you get.

501
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,752
Come on.

502
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,910
- There you go.
- Are you all right?

503
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,798
Yes, fine, thanks.

504
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,190
- You sure?
- Why is Rebecca here?

505
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,477
Oh, God. Well, I mentioned
that we were coming

506
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,519
and she said why didn't they come too,
and I couldn't say no, could I?

507
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,035
Come on, you two, let's crack on,
shall we?

508
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,077
Actually, I might just sit this one out.
You head on.

509
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,549
- See you down there.
- You sure?

510
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,870
Absolutely. I'll be fine in a minute.

511
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,429
Right, I'll see you at base camp, then.

512
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,872
<i>Bastard.
I can't believe he's left me.</i>

513
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,669
Ooh.

514
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,879
Oooh.

515
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,312
<i>So, romantic getaway
has turned into lawyer's reunion.</i>

516
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,913
Oooh.

517
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,038
<i>I can't believe
we're already into group holidays</i>

518
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,397
<i>after only eight weeks
of total, undisturbed sex.</i>

519
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,951
<i>Walt a minute...</i>

520
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,429
<i>No. Eight weeks?</i>

521
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,909
It couldn't be, could it?

522
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,116
<i>Totally undisturbed...</i>

523
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,431
<i>Oh, God. I'm pregnant.</i>

524
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,916
<i>And going to die!</i>

525
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,672
Oh, my God!

526
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,713
I can't see!

527
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,950
Big bump!

528
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,156
Get out of the way!

529
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,112
<i>Who's this? An eccentric
but exhilarating performance</i>

530
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,395
<i>from a total unknown,</i>

531
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,757
<i>who's now solidly in position
for the bronze.</i>

532
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,396
I would like a pregnancy test, please.

533
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,075
A pregnancy test.

534
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,910
<i>Ich bien, er, possibly...</i>

535
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,798
<i>mit baby.</i>

536
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,712
Er...

537
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,998
<i>Kinder! I am on back...</i>

538
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,276
and he, er...

539
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,115
<i>maken ze lieben.
Er, with me.</i>

540
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,273
She's pregnant!

541
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,350
Oh, no! No, no, not pregnant.

542
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,077
She's bloated.

543
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,037
<i>- Condom?
- Nein. Nein, nein.</i>

544
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,033
Maybe like this, but maybe like this.

545
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,714
I think her problem is psychological.

546
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,348
There is nothing
a pill can do to help her.

547
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,193
I'm a girl and I met a boy.

548
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,511
<i>Fraulein, and I met frau... boy.</i>

549
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,312
<i>And possibly now mit baby, uh-huh?</i>

550
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,989
<i>Right, moment of truth awaits.</i>

551
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,031
<i>What if I am pregnant?</i>

552
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,149
<i>I must try not to get hopes up too high.</i>

553
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,278
<i>Boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky.</i>

554
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,557
Bridget? I have been looking
everywhere for you.

555
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,633
I thought you'd broken a leg
or something... Oh, God.

556
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,359
- You're not...?
- I might be.

557
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,835
- What if I were?
- Well, I suppose I'd...

558
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,476
To be quite frank,
it'd be bloody fantastic.

559
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,313
I mean, if a little ahead of schedule.

560
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,234
- Are you really pregnant?
- Well, give it three minutes.

561
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,992
- What do you fancy? Boy or a girl?
- I dunno, it doesn't matter.

562
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,117
Although, I suppose I've always had
the fantasy of a son.

563
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,076
- Another Mark Darcy.
- Or maybe something like Huck.

564
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,915
Or River. Or some fabulous
Hebrew name like Noah.

565
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,356
Anyway, I could teach him
to play cricket and rugby

566
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,715
and visit him at Eton
on St Andrew's Day.

567
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,869
Eton?

568
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,999
Yes. The Darcy men have been going
to Eton for five generations.

569
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,714
Well, my son's not going to be
sent away from home.

570
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,953
Especially to some fascist institution
where they stick a poker up your arse

571
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,509
that you're never allowed
to remove again.

572
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,391
I see.

573
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,270
- I didn't mean you.
- No, of course not.

574
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,477
So what's the alternative?
Sleeping in his parents' bed,

575
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,596
breastfeeding until he's a teenager

576
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,117
<i>and some progressive school, where the
day is spent singing Yellow Submarine?</i>

577
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,872
Oh, you're absolutely right.

578
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,158
It's madness to allow a child to enjoy
his education or live with his parents.

579
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,108
What is madness is to have a child
if his parents can't have a discussion

580
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,157
without one shouting at the other.

581
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,469
It's negative.

582
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,995
- That's too bad.
- Yes, very sad.

583
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,070
Perhaps we should go out for lunch
tomorrow. Get out of the grump.

584
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,390
That's a good idea in theory,
but you made a family arrangement.

585
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,356
Oh, God.

586
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,349
Darlings!

587
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,353
I've had the fabulous idea
of inviting your parents.

588
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,478
<i>Another one
of Mother's culinary triumphs.</i>

589
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,189
<i>- Everything in miniature.
- Mini treacle tart, Admiral Darcy?</i>

590
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,239
No, no, thank you. The mini spotted dick
rather finished me off.

591
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,274
So, Mark, Bridget, when are you
two lovebirds going to name the day?

592
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,117
Bridget, you must want to hear
those ding-dong bells.

593
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,513
Well, we're certainly not thinking
about that yet. Are we, Bridget?

594
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,196
No. God, no.

595
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,157
Of course not.

596
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,675
Good.
Well, that's that sorted.

597
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,354
So, Admiral, out on the high seas.
How was it?

598
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,152
- Did you mean that thing you said?
- What thing?

599
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,710
- You know what thing.
- No, I don't know what thing.

600
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,511
The thing thing.

601
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,198
Now, let's see, there are any number
of things, um...

602
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,669
in an afternoon full
of all sorts of things,

603
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,637
so I, um...

604
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,157
The thing where you said
you're not, um...

605
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,948
That you're not,
not even thinking about, um...

606
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,155
What's the matter?

607
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,876
Let's get a drink.

608
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,715
I'm going to go to the loo,
then I'm going to come back.

609
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,155
And then we're going to be civilised.

610
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,432
<i>If you have a message for Mark Darcy,
speak after the tone.</i>

611
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,876
<i>Mark, It's Rebecca. Are you there?</i>

612
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,437
<i>Obviously not.
Probably still out with Bridget.</i>

613
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,710
<i>Um... Anyway, I hope lunch
with the parents went well.</i>

614
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,917
<i>I'm sure you were dutiful
and very polite, as usual.</i>

615
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,995
<i>Er... Whatever. Anyway, look, maybe
give me a ring when you get back.</i>

616
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,720
<i>I thought I might pop round
for a nightcap.</i>

617
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,996
<i>But I suppose that's a silly idea.
Bridget's probably there.</i>

618
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,670
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

619
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,835
Oh, Christ, what now?

620
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,788
Are you or are you not having an affair
with Rebecca Gillies?

621
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,278
I won't dignify that question
with an answer.

622
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,158
Right.

623
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,832
All I did was go to the loo.

624
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,757
Bridget!

625
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,718
Bridget.

626
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,109
That's not your coat.

627
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,916
Oh, right.

628
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,271
Oh, Bridget, what are you doing?

629
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,516
I read you should never date someone if
you can think of three reasons not to.

630
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,398
- Can you think of three?
- Yes.

631
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,269
- Which are?
- Well, first off, I embarrass you.

632
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,591
I can't ski, I can't ride,
I can't speak Latin.

633
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,309
My legs only come up to here and yes,
I will always be a little bit fat.

634
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,916
And you, you fold your underpants
before you go to bed.

635
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,390
- Now, hang on, that can't be a reason.
- No, it's not a reason.

636
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,551
But you're not perfect either.

637
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,359
You look down your nose
at absolutely everyone,

638
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,036
and you're incapable of doing anything
spontaneous or potentially affectionate.

639
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,431
It feels like you're waiting
to find someone in the VIP room

640
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,068
who's, who's so fantastic...

641
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,751
just the way she is,

642
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,480
that you don't need to fix her.

643
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,153
Bridget, this is mad.

644
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,675
Perhaps you've already found her.

645
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,395
Do you want to marry me?

646
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,431
Look, I...

647
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,438
You see, you can never
muster the strength...

648
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,870
to fight for me.

649
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,710
<i>I can't believe I did that.</i>

650
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,470
<i># What do I gotta do
to make you love me?</i>

651
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,238
<i># What do I gotta do to make you care?</i>

652
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,989
<i># What do I gotta do
when lightning strikes me</i>

653
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,593
<i># Hmm</i>

654
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,399
<i># And I wake to find
that you're not there?</i>

655
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,156
<i># What do I gotta do
to make you want me?</i>

656
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,868
<i># Hmm</i>

657
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,032
<i># What do I gotta do to be heard?</i>

658
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:14,153
<i># And what do I say
when it's all over, babe?</i>

659
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,753
<i># Oooh-ooh</i>

660
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,118
<i># And sorry seems to be the hardest word</i>

661
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,635
<i># It's sad
So sad</i>

662
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,190
<i># Why can't we talk it over, babe?</i>

663
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,794
<i># Always seems to me</i>

664
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,591
<i># When sorry seems to be</i>

665
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,558
<i># The hardest word #</i>

666
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,150
<i>Five weeks later.</i>

667
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,073
<i>Weight: 4,000 pounds.</i>

668
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:55,279
<i>Am enjoying a relationship with two men
simultaneously.</i>

669
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,637
<i>The first is called Ben,
the other, Jerry.</i>

670
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,951
<i>Number of current boyfriends: Zero.</i>

671
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,350
<i>Number of calls from ex-boyfriend:</i>

672
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,717
<i>You have absolutely no messages.</i>

673
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,395
<i>Not a single one.
Not even from your mother.</i>

674
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,349
- Hello?
- Hello, darling.

675
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,229
<i>- You haven't forgotten our lunch date?
- Of course I have.</i>

676
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,358
<i>- I'm suicidally depressed.
- Don't be silly, Bridget.</i>

677
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,875
Meet me at Debenhams at twelve o'clock.

678
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,958
Mum... I thought we were going
to have something to eat.

679
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,749
Patience, please. I've got
a big surprise for you, darling.

680
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,358
- What?
- Don't say "what", say "pardon".

681
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,912
Tra-la!

682
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,992
- What do you think?
- Oh, my God.

683
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,116
Daddy and I are getting married.

684
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,953
- You're already married.
- We're doing it again.

685
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,317
Reaffirming our vows.
You are going to be a bridesmaid,

686
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,233
and absolutely everything
is going to be lavender.

687
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,834
And when I say everything, I mean...

688
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,839
...everything.

689
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,150
<i>Oh, God, I'm never going to get married</i>

690
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,788
<i>and my sodding mum and dad
are doing it twice.</i>

691
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,748
<i># No more candlelight
No more romance</i>

692
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,276
<i>- # No more small talk...
- Bloody know-It-all.</i>

693
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,834
<i>New York: The Big, Juicy Apple.</i>

694
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,788
<i>The city that never sleeps
with the same person two nights running.</i>

695
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,033
<i>My favorite place in America, where Sex
And The City isn't just a programme,</i>

696
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,077
<i>It's a promise.</i>

697
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,870
<i>Morning, Rach.</i>

698
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,758
Sorry.

699
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,515
Oh, cheer up, misery guts.
I have good news for you.

700
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,591
Sure, right.

701
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,718
What's the angle?
I interview some rocket scientist

702
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,713
while he looks through my skirt
with X-ray glasses?

703
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,313
No.

704
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,831
Although that is a bloody good idea.

705
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,319
<i>No. The fact is The Smooth Guide
is doing very well with women,</i>

706
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,792
but the network want us to cast
a wider net and use a Smooth Guide-ess.

707
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,032
Me? With Daniel Oleaver?

708
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,909
It's the next logical step.
I think Thailand is first on the list.

709
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,640
No. I won't do it.

710
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,473
Not now.
Not in a million years from now.

711
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,279
- Excuse me?
- I am a top television journalist,

712
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,590
not some boorish bint in a bikini.

713
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,117
Really? Strong words from somebody
who doesn't know where Germany is.

714
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,475
Who told you that?

715
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,030
Oleaver. He said he couldn't be expected
to go out with someone

716
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,070
who thought Iran was David Bowie's wife,
and who didn't know where Germany was.

717
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:46,109
Daniel Oleaver is a deceitful, sexist,
disgusting specimen of humanity,

718
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,874
that I wouldn't share a lift with,
let alone a job.

719
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,554
Come on, Jones, there must have been
something you liked about me.

720
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,792
Well... you have a nice car.

721
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,832
And quite nice manners.
Outside the bedroom.

722
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,956
But that's about it.

723
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,994
And by the way,
I know exactly where Germany is.

724
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,470
The question is do you know the location
of your arsehole?

725
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,155
As a matter of fact, I do know the
exact location of my arsehole. And hers.

726
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,114
Oh, come on, Jones,
it was just a silly joke.

727
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,759
Not a very funny one.

728
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,273
- Go on, then.
- What?

729
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,351
Where is it? Where is Germany?

730
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,193
- Next to France.
- And?

731
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,590
And also Belgium...

732
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,274
Poland. And it has a sea coast.

733
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,309
Which sea?

734
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,031
Oh, sod it. Now, look,

735
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,839
I think we should talk
about Finch's suggestion.

736
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,991
I am going to Thailand, Jones.

737
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,674
Wouldn't you like to be
my little Girl Guide?

738
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,870
Thailand?

739
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,589
- You'll shag before you leave Heathrow.
- I'll be perfectly fine.

740
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,751
I'm eschewing all men.

741
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,039
And cigarettes. And carbohydrates.

742
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,953
- We can't possibly let you go.
- On your own.

743
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,031
Oh, stop it, all of you.

744
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,919
I am a mature, sophisticated,
professional woman

745
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,631
and I'm going to Thailand
entirely on my own, thank you very much.

746
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,199
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

747
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,351
- Fuckity fuck.
- Sorry.

748
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,911
<i>And now our final passengers
have joined us, we can get underway.</i>

749
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,071
Someone's gotta be last.

750
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,232
Are we not sitting together?

751
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,311
Oh, fuck.

752
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,798
I don't think we're really
in a position to, um...

753
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,988
...make a fuss.
Sorry. Hi.

754
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,795
Sorry.

755
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,592
What's our film?

756
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,675
What's your name? Mine's Olive.

757
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,751
Er, Bridget.

758
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,798
<i>Good afternoon again,
ladles and gentlemen.</i>

759
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,758
<i>We're about to offer a wide range
of duty-free items.</i>

760
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,514
<i>Details can be found
In your in-flight magazine.</i>

761
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,039
Wonderful people, the Thais.
Particularly the young ladies.

762
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,111
If you know what I mean, eh?

763
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,874
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Come with me.

764
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,156
Come with me now.

765
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,754
- Where are we going?
- Just through here.

766
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,956
Thank you. This is worse than school.

767
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,156
It really wasn't my fault.

768
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,595
It's a fizzy drink, you know, it just...

769
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,876
It just sort of fizzied over.

770
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,476
Couldn’t bear to think of you back there
in slum class, Jones.

771
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,599
Graham, thank you. You are the best
air steward I've ever come across.

772
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,751
And if I may say so, the smartest.

773
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,319
Thank you, sir.

774
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,753
I thought you were there already,
doing research.

775
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,797
Fuck, no. I make it up as I go along.

776
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,509
It's 13 hours for this trip.
I need some in-flight entertainment.

777
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,195
Why don't you tell me, in detail,
about your school netball tour,

778
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,716
particularly the unsavoury incident
in the communal showers.

779
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,838
I didn't play netball.
Or go to a girls' school.

780
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,470
- Or have showers.
- Now that's just not true, is it?

781
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,551
- Let me start you off.
- No.

782
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,269
<i>If you're gonna be dull, I'm going
to plunge back into Mrs Dalloway,</i>

783
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,512
and you know how she loves that.
Dirty, dirty bitch.

784
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,515
<i># Here's a new thing</i>

785
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,272
<i># That's gonna please ya</i>

786
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,829
<i># Just a little town down in Indonesia</i>

787
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,075
<i># Bangkok...</i>

788
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,959
<i>Arrived Bangkok. Very hot.</i>

789
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,954
<i>Relieved at last to throw myself
Into serious journalistic work.</i>

790
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,913
Thailand has long called travellers
from around the globe

791
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,595
to take spiritual succour
and karmic rest.

792
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,675
For centuries, Western visitors
have been inevitably drawn

793
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,071
to some of Bangkok's oldest sanctuaries.

794
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,676
So true, Bridget. Even I,
fight it as I may, am no exception.

795
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,799
The moment I arrive here,
I almost feel an irresistible pull...

796
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,555
...to this. The Temple of Tranquillity.

797
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,075
Indeed, nothing symbolises Thailand's
extraordinary fusion of East and West,

798
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,516
of tradition and innovation,
better than this.

799
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,830
Fully body-to-body massage.

800
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,309
<i>- Sawatdee kha?
- Sawatdee khrab?</i>

801
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,712
An incredible thing about Thailand
is the amazing traditional cuisine.

802
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,759
I'm going to taste kapaluk,
the ultimate delicacy.

803
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,790
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

804
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,871
Oh, my God. My God.

805
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,474
Um... Er... Mmm.

806
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,029
How about a lovely locust?

807
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,270
I can't. No, no, I can't.

808
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,396
They're delicious.

809
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,993
Oh!

810
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,789
Now that is Ko Panyi, which is
the setting for a very famous Thai poem,

811
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,190
which I think you'd like very much,
Jones.

812
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,399
It's all about a badly-behaved prince
who finds true love with a beautiful,

813
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,632
and as it happens,
very slightly overweight princess.

814
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,796
- You're teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.

815
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,229
"Oh, Suvarnamali
Why can you not see that I adore you?"

816
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,709
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"

817
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,791
"If you cast me off and leave me

818
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,076
How should I live another day?"

819
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,078
And you thought all I knew of Thailand
was pussies and ping-pong balls.

820
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,152
- You wouldn't sleep with him?
- No, of course not.

821
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,595
Absolutely not.

822
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,751
But he is clever.

823
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,399
- Yes?
- And handsome.

824
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,950
He's also a dysfunctional,
fucked-up, middle-aged, lost boy.

825
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,031
Well, no-one's perfect.

826
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,075
I didn't realise you were busy.

827
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,389
- He's young enough to be your grandson.
- I know. Isn't that great?

828
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,554
Come on, guys, I've got a very special
treat lined up for lunch.

829
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,995
<i>I'm getting rather fond of Jed,</i>

830
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,391
<i>and I must say he has a genuine interest
In Thai cuisine.</i>

831
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,314
I wouldn't have thought
omelette would be big in Thailand.

832
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,950
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- It's magic.

833
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,598
It is a magic mushroom omelette,
isn't it?

834
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,551
Well, that's awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.

835
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,551
Although, thank God,

836
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,958
the mushrooms don't actually
seem to be working.

837
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,596
<i># Just what is It
that you want to do?</i>

838
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,799
Such lovely colours!

839
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,838
<i># We wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time...</i>

840
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,551
Beautiful Bridget! Beautiful Bridget!
Beautiful Bridget!

841
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,951
Bridget Jones!

842
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,029
Bridget Jones!

843
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,838
But, wait...

844
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,197
- Bridget Jones?
- What sound is that?

845
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,672
It is Daniel Oleaver.

846
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:40,594
How unutterably beautiful he is.

847
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,429
Jones, what the hell are you doing?

848
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,559
<i>You are lovely colours.</i>

849
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,119
<i>- # I don't wanna lose your love...
- Here.</i>

850
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,271
Here I am.

851
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,469
I think you're completely off your face.

852
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,597
Hey.

853
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,672
Bloody hell.

854
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,112
Oh... Oh, I'm an angel.

855
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,793
Oh. How lovely.

856
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,235
Glorious sand.

857
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,118
Oh.

858
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,396
I want to be naked.

859
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,158
- Naked as a baby.
- Come on, then, angel. Up you get.

860
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,191
- All right?
- Mmm.

861
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,596
- How are you feeling?
- Completely embarrassed.

862
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,991
Don't be. You're charming on drugs.
In future, just say yes.

863
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,749
Do you know, I never really understood
why you wanted to go out with me.

864
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,433
- It seemed so unlikely.
- Come on. For God's sake.

865
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,433
You're sexy. You make me laugh.

866
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,909
At you, of course, not with you.

867
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,516
And you were...

868
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,398
...incidentally...

869
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,758
...the best shag...

870
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,478
...I ever had.

871
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,153
The best?

872
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,517
Aside from Simon Reade
in the fifth-form locker room, yeah.

873
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,914
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?

874
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,911
Pretty good?

875
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,235
Was I better than Mark Darcy?

876
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,552
By the way, is it true he always says
"I'm sorry, I think I'm going to come"?

877
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,598
- Who told you that?
- It's common knowledge, isn't it?

878
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,519
Come on, Jones. Who gave who the hoof?

879
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,716
And why?

880
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,796
Let's just say

881
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,111
that we suffered
from a fatal incompatibility.

882
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,796
I have missed you, Jones.

883
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,599
I don't suppose
there's any circumstances

884
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,035
in which you would ever consider

885
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,873
thinking about trusting me again?

886
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,351
Absolutely not.

887
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,070
Well, I suppose I'll be getting back
to my little hut now.

888
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,236
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.

889
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,598
Is that the Big Dipper
or the little one?

890
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,876
I can never tell them apart.

891
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,712
Definitely the big one.

892
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,792
You can't see the little one
this close to the equator.

893
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,475
Oh, please.
You don't know about astronomy.

894
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,074
I most certainly do.
I'm passionate about it.

895
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,069
You know, Jones, if stargazing
is something that interests you,

896
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,153
then it has to be said that the view
from my balcony is quite outstanding.

897
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,273
Perhaps you'd like to come up
and have a little look?

898
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,237
I don't think so.

899
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,437
See over there? Along my arm.

900
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,556
That's it, over there.

901
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,750
That is Orion's Belt.

902
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,994
And next to that is a very sexy little
constellation called Ursa's Maiden.

903
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,149
Ah.

904
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,551
She's being very naughty
and trying to undo Orion's belt.

905
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,433
All right, what about...
that one?

906
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,392
Yes, well that is
a very, very famous star.

907
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,835
Um, right next to, of course, um...

908
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,192
I don't know, some other fucking star
that's been there for years and years.

909
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,557
Seen one star, you've seen the lot,
that's what I say, Jones.

910
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,155
Different with girls, though.

911
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,071
Some girls...

912
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,151
...are special.

913
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,356
Are they?

914
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,111
I think so.

915
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,592
What is this special power
you hold over me, Jones?

916
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,836
And what about your therapy?

917
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,551
I think you might be it.

918
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,756
<i># I'm not in love</i>

919
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,951

920
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,550

01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,631

<i># I call you up</i>

924
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,752
<i># Don't get me wrong</i>

925
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,753
<i># Don't think you've got it made</i>

926
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,791
<i># I'm not in love...</i>

927
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,199
God, I hope you're wearing
those giant panties.

928
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,475
Please.

929
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,473
Please be wearing the giant panties.

930
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,631
Please.

931
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,791
Oh, my old friends.

932
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,599
Oh, Daddy's home.

933
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,435
Did you miss me?
Because Daddy missed you. Yes, he did.

934
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,713
Wait.

935
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,553
Sorry.

936
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,790
Can I just have a minute?

937
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,871
Just a minute.

938
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,629
<i>Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.</i>

939
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,395

941
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,635
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, sure.

942
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,676
Just a bit... nervous.

943
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,519
I mean, you see,
if I stay with you tonight,

944
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:02,639
well, it's definitely
the end of something...

945
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,916
important with someone.

946
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,719
Um, which has probably ended already,

947
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,713
- but perhaps...
- Bridge, Bridge Bridge, Bridge.

948
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,189
Doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance?

949
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,473
Hmm?

950
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,632
Except Hitler.

951
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,391
Well, he was very, very, very naughty.

952
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,679
What?

953
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,230
Nothing. Er, come back later, please.
Thank you very much.

954
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,475
Bridge, it's nothing.
Leave it. Leave it.

955
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,548
You made order for 10.30.

956
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,436
Order for what?

957
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,793
Me.

958
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,632
10.30.

959
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,200
You know, I've had it up to here
with this hotel.

960
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,035
- It's been cock-ups like this all week.
- You Mr Oleaver?

961
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,512
Yesterday, you with Maria.
She say you big tipper.

962
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,468
I mean, I'm up for it if you are.

963
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,916
Actually, no, that was stupid.
It's just one little slip.

964
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,595
Don't let it ruin what was gonna be
a fantastic weekend shagathon.

965
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,832
- I don't want a shagathon.
- No, nor do I. Nor do I.

966
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,992
- You're right.
- You're looking for a weekend of sex,

967
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,232
- I'm looking...
- For more. I feel I can change.

968
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,789
- I absolutely can change.
- I need to change.

969
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,076
I can't believe I fell for it again.

970
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,913
Daniel, I really do think

971
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,753
that you should go and fuck yourself.

972
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,629
Or her. But definitely not me.

973
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,279

I can't believe he made up
the sex therapy thing.

978
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,995
Doesn't matter.
I finally learnt my lesson,

979
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,833
and it's an excellent lesson
to have nailed.

980
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,993
- Fuck!
- What?

981
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,435
No fucking room in the fucking suitcase.

982
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,909
There's room in mine. Give me something.

983
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,798
Great.

984
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:25,270
- What the hell is this?
- It is a fertility-snake bowl.

985
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,749
- Ooh.
- Jed gave it to me.

986

<i>- # Think think

987
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,353

<i># Freedom...</i>

989
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,839
The way I look at it, in everyone's
life, there's a certain amount of shit.

990
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,434
- That's true.
- In the last year,

991
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,989
things have turned out pretty shitty.

992
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,230
So logically, mathematically, even,

993
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,233
it's got to be time
for something not shit.

994
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,996
- Like what?
- Maybe Mark will have chucked Rebecca.

995
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,469
And he'll run to my door,

996
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,758
fall to his knees,
possibly wearing a wet white shirt,

997
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,717
and beg me to come back.

998
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,074

Hello. Oh...

1004
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,238
Seems to be getting a bit excited.

Oh.

- It's just a misunderstanding.

1008
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,078
Hold the plane.

1009
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,992
Hold the plane.

1010
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,196
Excuse me! Excuse me!

- Yes.

1014
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,436
I mean, they're not my favourite pair.

1015
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,396
You can't do this. I'm English.

01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,676
And an award-winning journalist.

1017
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:15,152
Well, maybe not award-winning, but I
have been to lots of award ceremonies.

1018
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,793
Hello. Bridget Jones.

1019
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,350
Lovely to meet all of you.

1020
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,835
<i>Oh, my bloody God and fuck.</i>

1021
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,468
<i>I hope they've told
the British ambassador.</i>

1022
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,200
<i>Surely Shazzer
would have raised the alert.</i>

1023
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,510
<i>Maybe they got Shazzer as well.</i>

1024
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,158
<i>Oh, God, 28 hours.</i>

1025
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,877
<i>How much longer?</i>

1026
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,759
Jones.
Bridget Jones, you come now.

1027
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,517
Charlie Parker-Knowles,
Assistant Consul.

1028
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:12,830
Thank God you're here.

1029
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,272
Um, shall we...

1030
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,432
I really had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

1031
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,511
Jed planned the whole thing.

1032
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,638
That's why he snogged Shazzer,
who's much older than him

1033
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,711
and slightly past her peak.

1034
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,314
Yes, he sounds the most frightful shit.

1035
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,708
Mmm.

1036
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,192
The bore is everyone who gets caught
has exactly the same story,

1037
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,956
so unless we find this, this Jed fellow
and get a full confession,

1038
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,156
you're on a bit of a sticky wicket.

1039
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,591
Well, how sticky?

1040
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,990
Something like 15 to 20 years.

1041
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,596
- 15 years?
- Or maybe ten if we're lucky.

1042
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,671
Ten years!

1043
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,115
In here?

1044
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,236
<i>Very black.</i>

1045
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,393
<i>All my life I've had the feeling
something terrible was about to happen.</i>

1046
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,276
<i>Now it has.</i>

1047
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,271
Bijjit, right?

1048
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,317
Bridget, actually.

1049
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,232
My name Phrao.

1050
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,311
You're my friend?

1051
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,311
- Steady on!
- Superbra!

1052
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:37,552
You lend me. One day, two cigarette.

1053
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,237
Oh.

1054
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,550
Well, I'll think about it.

1055
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,590
Actually, I was thinking of giving up,

1056
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,070
but that was before I was arrested
and thrown into a Thai prison

1057
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,754
for ten to 15 years.

1058
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,470
Circumstances change.

1059
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,511
No, it really, really is "touched".

1060
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,517
"Like a vir-gin,
touched for the very first time".

1061
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,159
- No, you wrong.
- No.

1062
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,197
<i># Like a wersion</i>

1063
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,113
<i>- vir-gin.
- # Fucked for the very first time</i>

1064
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,829
<i>- Touched.
- # Like a wersion</i>

1065
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,070
<i>Ten years of this? I</i>

1066
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,959
Stop! Enough. Enough.

1067
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,749
If you're going to do it,
you really ought to do it properly.

1068
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:29,559
After all, Madonna is nothing
if not a perfectionist.

1069
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,995
Five, six, seven, eight and one...

1070
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,355
<i># Like a virgin</i>

1071
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,114

1072
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,189

01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,874

1075
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,916
<i>Dear Mum and Dad,</i>

1076
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,991
<i>I'm missing you a lot.</i>

1077
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,469
<i>Please write as soon as you can.</i>

1078
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,110
<i>I'm feeling pretty low.</i>

1079
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,276
Bijjit Jone.

1080
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,074
In there. You have five minutes.

1081
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,958
Just five.

1082
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,193
Mark?

1083
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,751
You all right?

1084
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:33,354
Oh... Fine.

1085
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,158
Hmm.

1086
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,913
And... scared shitless.

1087
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,036
But, you know, perky.

1088
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,989
I can't believe
you've come all this way.

1089
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,391
I haven't. I was out here
handling a Foreign Office case

1090
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,471
when I heard about your situation.

1091
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,029
I haven't done anything wrong.

1092
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,714
I promise you, it's all a big mistake.

1093
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,269
Yes, well, I'm sure it is.

1094
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,477
I've got all the papers here
and I'm sure we can sort it out.

1095
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,952
I think about you all the time.
And I'm so sorry,

1096
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,272
I really, really am,
for everything that happened between us.

1097
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,396
Yes, well...

1098
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,235
We don't have much time and I need you
to identify someone for me.

1099
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,188
Is this the man with whom you were
seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms

1100
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,920
before you spent the night
with Daniel Oleaver?

1101
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,719
Yes, that's him,
but I think you should know...

1102
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,917
The same man who gave you
the snake containing the drugs?

1103
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,389
Yes, that's him, that's Jed.

1104
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,551
But it was Shazzer's snake, not mine,

1105
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,915
and as far as Daniel Oleaver goes...

1106
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,072
Your sex life doesn't concern me at all.

1107
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,354
Has there been any ill treatment here?

1108
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,390
No, no. Well, I mean...

1109
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,719
...the toilet facilities
are well below par, but...

1110
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,791
Good, that makes things simpler.

1111
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,272
Listen, they're prepared
to drop all charges against you

1112
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,796
which is extremely lenient,
given the circumstances.

1113
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,394
You're going to be out within a week.

1114
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,553
And...

1115
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,632
Goodbye.

1116
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,439
Mark?

1117
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,357
Thank you.

1118
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,794
You're welcome. I'm just the messenger.
The order came from above.

1119
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,479
Well, good luck.
Glad I could be of help.

1120
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,196
So, Bijjit, what happen?

1121
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,396
Well, um...

1122
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,555
Bijjit! How this can happen?

1123
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,712
This is terrible! You are innocent!

1124
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,429
- They're always cheating us.
- No, no, no. That's all fine.

1125
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,910
They've dropped the charges
and they're letting me go.

1126
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,957
But that good news.

1127
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,111
What is wrong?

1128
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,873
Mark Darcy definitely...

1129
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,508
...doesn't love me anymore.

1130
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,432
Ohhh.

1131
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,719
You see the trouble is
it was me who chucked him.

1132
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,916
He treat you bad?

1133
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,991
Yeah, actually, he did.

1134
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,390
My boyfriend treat me bad too.

1135
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,118
- Me too.
- Mine as well.

1136
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,633
Me too.

1137
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,156
Then you know all about it.
You think you've found the right man,

1138
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,629
but then there's so much wrong with him

1139
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,873
and he finds there's so much wrong
with you and it all just falls apart.

1140
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,349
Don't tell me. My boyfriend,

1141
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,431
he seem really nice.

1142
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,513
Then he start to hit me.
Make me work on street.

1143
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,989
My boyfriend, he say he love me.

1144
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,789
But he do no work,
and make me work 24 hour a day.

1145
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,030
Then he make me take heroin drug.

1146
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,715
What about you, Bijjit?
What your bad boyfriend do?

1147
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,076
Well, er...

1148
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,555
...he really didn't stick up for me
at this lawyers' supper...

1149
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:49,077
and, um, then he would fold his...

1150
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,633
Oh, same sort of thing, really.

1151
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,635
Hitting me and making me take drugs.
Stealing all my money and stuff.

1152
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,432
<i>Oh, God.
I've been the world’s biggest fool.</i>

1153
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,952
Bijjit?

1154
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,678
Just a few tiny leaving presents.
No luxuries.

1155
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,675
<i># Living in a material world</i>

1156
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,035
<i># And I am a material girl</i>

1157
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,398
<i># You know that we are living
In a material world</i>

1158
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,915
<i># And I am a material girl</i>

1159
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,197
<i># Living in a material world</i>

1160
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:37,238
<i># And I am a material girl #</i>

1161
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,755
If you want something smooth
on your wall,

1162
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,831
you could do worse than John Currin.

1163
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,037
He is about the only
contemporary painter who can paint.

1164
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,351
There's usually something
interesting and allegorical,

1165
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,398
plus of course,
there is a very high perv quotient.

1166
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,869
- Did you see her?
- Out. Out it.

1167
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,349
Sorry, everyone, sorry. It's my stalker.

1168
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,949
Fuck off, Darcy,
some people have jobs to do.

1169
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,309
Did you see her surrounded by police,
dogs, handcuffs?

1170
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,836
Come on, she's a big girl,
she can take care of herself.

1171
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,276
I'm only going to ask you one more time.
Did you see her?

1172
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,749
You're only gonna ask me one more time?

1173
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,396
- You haven't got your wig on now, dear.
- I'll take that as a yes.

1174
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,710
Yes, I did see her.

1175
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,190
<i>I thought she was smuggling seashells,
or mangoes:</i>

1176
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,679
Right.

1177
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,992
Right, good.
Will you step outside, please?

1178
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,310
Oh, no, it's not possible.

1179
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,870
Darcy, do you have any idea
what century we actually live in?

1180
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,316
Are you gonna step outside
or am I gonna have to drag you?

1181
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,675
I think you're gonna have to drag me.

1182
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:50,310
- You're insane!
- And you're a disgrace, Oleaver.

1183
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:53,036
You're pulling my hair!

1184
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,272

- No, you're going in, Oleaver!

1193
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:24,473
If I'm going in, you're coming with me.

1194
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,437
You smug bastard.

1195
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,750
- Oh, my God.
- Get up.

1196
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,271
Well, what are you gonna do now?

1197
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,749
Drown me in 16 inches of water?

1198
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,638
Yes, good idea.

1199
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,478
Fuck! Stop, stop.

1200
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,631
Listen, listen, listen...

1201
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,952
OK, I left her at the airport.
I shouldn't have done that.

1202
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,990
But she bumped into Jed herself

1203
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,879
and I didn't fucking well seduce her,
all right?

1204
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,634
- You didn't?
- There's something wrong with her.

1205
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,552
She's gone all frigid.

1206
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,995
I spent the night
with a gorgeous Thai girl.

1207
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,879
Who in fact turned out to be
a gorgeous Thai boy.

1208
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,959
Satisfied?

1209
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,152
Yes.

1210
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,833
Thank you.

1211
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,231
You know what, mate?

1212
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,833
If you're so obsessed with Bridget
Jones, why don't you just marry her?

1213
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,829
'Cause then she'd definitely shag me.

- What was it like?
- How did you survive?

1219
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:55,158
Any girl who's been single in London
knows how to handle herself.

1220
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,834
- Darling!
- Will you be going back?

1221
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,594
Sorry I didn't write.
I've just been so busy.

1222
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,593
Hello, darling. You look lovely.

1223
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,433
- Skinny, but lovely.
- Oh, thank you.

1224
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,592
Oh, it's good to be home.

1225
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,069
- Ciggy?
- No, no, thanks.

1226
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,312
- I've given up again.
- Shame. I find them very useful.

1227
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:19,519
I take great comfort in the fact they
might kill me before things get worse.

1228
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,672
The Darcys rang to say how pleased
they were you were out.

1229
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,199
I rather thought Mark might be here
to meet you.

1230
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,749
Yes, but you must remember we split up.

1231
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,115
So no hope there?

1232
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,191
No hope there.

1233
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:46,195
Believe me,
next time I will not fuck it up, Mum.

1234
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,476
- Language, darling.
- Sorry.

1235
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,996
Next time, I will not fuck it up...

1236
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,830

Surprise!

1249
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,751
- Hello.
- Hello.

1250
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,831
- Oh, darling.
- Hiya.

1251
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:08,953
Bridget...

1252
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,997
I'm so sorry.

1253
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,636
It's all right.

1254
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,828
Well, thank God for Mark Darcy.
I mean, he might be a boring arse,

1255
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,036
but he performed a miracle.

1256
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,669
That's a bit of an overstatement.

1257
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,914
He actually seems
to be the villain of this piece.

1258
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,150
He's a top human rights lawyer and he
left it to someone else to get me out.

1259
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,356
He was just a messenger.

1260
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,039
- Who told you that?
- He did.

1261
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,191
Straight from the horse's mouth.

1262
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,679
The horse wasn't quite
telling you the truth.

1263
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,149
I called Mark
the minute I landed in London.

1264
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,675
We went to his office
and within half an hour,

1265
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,718
he'd woken two Cabinet ministers
and half of Ml5.

1266
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,793
But none of them could locate Jed,
so Mark flew over to Interpol.

1267
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,235
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai,

1268
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,914
but they don't normally
extradite people,

1269
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,311
so Mark rang the Home Secretary
who rang our ambassador...

1270
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,631
In Riyadh. Then Mark flew to Dubai
where he identified Jed,

1271
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,075
who was impounded and pushed out into...

1272
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,118
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting
with the police.

1273
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,512
Jed was arrested and extradited back
to Britain. Then Mark flew to Bangkok,

1274
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,672
to make damn sure they'd let you go.

1275
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,118
Oh.

1276
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,839
He was just angry about Daniel Oleaver.

1277
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,318
- He must still love me.
- He fucking must.

1278
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,598
Taxi?

1279
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,034
Yes, please.

1280
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,116
Get in the cab!

1281
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:54,232
Hurry!

1282
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,155
Oh. I forgot about you.

1283
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,078
Er, I, I, I just wanted to, um...

1284
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,276
say something to Mark.

1285
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,715
He's at the office.
Do you want to come in?

1286
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,191
Oh, no. No, no, I don't think I will.

1287
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:38,756
I really hope
that you'll be happy together.

1288
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,956
- Sorry?
- You and Mark.

1289
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,908
I really hope that you'll be
very happy together.

1290
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,071
No, no, no, Bridget, listen...

1291
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,549
you've got it completely wrong.

1292
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:51,915
I'm not in love with him.

1293
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,275
How could I be when I'm...

1294
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,477
seriously heartbroken
and smitten with someone else?

1295
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,751
Someone else?

1296
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,593
- You, Bridget.
- Me?

1297
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:07,670
Ever since I saw you here
with your hair messed that night

1298
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,673
and bits of garden stuck to you.
You must have noticed.

1299
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,958
I try to hide it,
but every time I see you, I light up.

1300
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,315
I thought you were just, you know...

1301
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,469
...lying.

1302
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,710
Was every look I ever gave you a lie?

1303
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,552
I've been looking forward to this.

1304
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,950
Lovely to see you, Bridget.

1305
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,310
Thank you very much.

1306
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,796
That was lovely.

1307
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,832
Really lovely.

1308
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,434
But I'm afraid it's still men
in general,

1309
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:00,275
and Mark Darcy in particular,
that I love.

1310
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:01,954
Right.

1311
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,628
Lf, er, if I ever do decide to, um...

1312
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,839
you know, bat for the other side...

1313
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,469
...well, there's no-one else.

1314
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,439

01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,358
Thank you very much.

1356
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,274
<i># Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no</i>

1357
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,396
<i># Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no</i>

1358
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,676

1359
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:57,910
<i># Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh no no...</i>

1360
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:02,193
I love you.
I always have and I always will.

1361
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,116
Oh, um...

1362
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,477
I don't love you,
and I never have, and...

1363
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,474
...I never will. Sorry.

1364
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,038
Come in.

1365
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,396
Hello, Bridget.

1366
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,471
Hello, Mark.

1367
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,752
Er...

1368
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,317
I'm sorry, I'm disturbing you.

1369
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,193
- Well, yes, a bit.
- I'll just...

1370
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:46,476
sit outside while you finish.

1371
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,838
No, no, no, please,
say what you have to say, young lady.

1372
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,997
Mr Santiago
is the Peruvian Secretary for Trade.

1373
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,795
And Mr Hernández is his number two.

1374
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,796
Hello.

1375
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,439
Hello.

1376
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,236
Hello, hello, hello.

1377
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,750
How can we help you, young lady?

1378
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,512
Well, er...

1379
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:17,556
Er...

1380
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,359
I just wanted to tell Mr Darcy here

1381
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:25,196
that I heard what magnificent work

1382
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,238
he actually did
releasing me from prison.

1383
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:36,317
Tiny, tiny misunderstanding to do
with an enormous stash of cocaine.

1384
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,040
And I also wanted to say,

1385
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:43,239
since having found out that his
girlfriend is actually a lesbian...

1386
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,192
...that I love him.

1387
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,192
Always have. Always will.

1388
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,313
And that I'm...

1389
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:00,833
...you know...

1390
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,356
...available for dates...

1391
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,474
...if he should feel so inclined.

1392
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,440
So, er, your girlfriend is a lesbian.

1393
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,150
Look, if you'll all just excuse us
for a second...

1394
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,478
I think we should...

1395
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:41,669
Bridget, that was not the most romantic
proposition I've ever heard.

1396
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:45,154
Well, maybe it is romantic

1397
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,629
because it's not. I mean...

1398
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,395
I know there's no music playing,
and it's not snowing,

1399
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:57,633
but that doesn't mean that it,
that it can't really be something.

1400
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,711
You're right.

1401
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,598
In fact, there's a question
I've been meaning to ask you.

1402
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:09,877
All right. As long as it's not
"Will you marry me?"

1403
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,551
Oh, God.
It is "Will you marry me?"

1404
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,950
Well, I'm not gonna say it now.

1405
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,680
- Is it "Will you marry me?"
- The moment's gone.

1406
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,956
No. No, no, no. No, wait.

1407
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,278
Wait.

1408
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:30,759
- Bridget.
- Start again.

1409
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,876
- No.
- Start again.

1410
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,951
I'm not gonna... It's...

1411
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,476
We've just stepped out
into the corridor,

1412
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,756
you say "I've got a question to ask you"

1413
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,036
and I don't say anything.

1414
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,750
And... And...

1415
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,392
You say...

1416
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,959
Bridget Jones, will you marry me?

1417
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,075
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here this day

1418
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,800
to unite this couple.

1419
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,318
Do you affirm your love,
one to the other?

1420
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,515
I do. Again.

1421
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,477
And Colin?

1422
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,471
I do. Again.

1423
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:44,076
As well. Of course.

1424
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,629
<i># I've been really tryin', baby...</i>

1425
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,308
<i>December 31st, year-end summary.</i>

1426
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,516
<i>Prison stays, one.</i>

1427
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,319
<i>Lesbian kisses, one.</i>

1428
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,755
<i>Pounds lost, minus one.</i>

1429
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,232
<i>Boyfriends lost but then regained

1430
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,391
<i>one:</i>

1431
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:14,358
<i>Marriage proposals, one.</i>

1432
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,909
<i>An excellent year's progress.</i>

1433
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:21,870

1447
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:05,070
<i>So, as you can see,
I have found my happy ending at last.</i>

1448
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:10,155
<i>And I truly believe
that happiness is possible.</i>
