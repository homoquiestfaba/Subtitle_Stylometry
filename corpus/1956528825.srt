1
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,531
Message coming in from the
flagship, captain.

2
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,400
Captain, I don't have to tell you

3
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,535
how important this mission
is to national security.

4
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,539
The entire free world is in danger.
Have you briefed your men yet?

5
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,242
Yes, sir, as we speak.
- It's time to go to work.

6
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,275
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,281
Every major terrorist act
in the last four years

8
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:59,484
has either been executed or devised
by this man, lieutenant.

9
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,391
These are the only photos we have.

10
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,761
Baker, get your head out of your
ass and get over here. - Yes, sir.

11
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,965
It's not much.
- Not much?

12
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,968
You can't see anything.
What else do we know about this guy?

13
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,937
All we know is that he
goes by the name Casper

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,740
and that he's the most resourceful
terrorist in the world today.

15
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,942
So I'm sure you will all jump for joy

16
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,479
when I tell you that our orders
are to bring him back alive.

17
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,383
Eloquently put, captain.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,220
Now, intel reports that they
do have underwater defenses.

19
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,891
Though antiquated, they may still
be operational and can kill you.

20
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,628
At 20:35 we'll break the surface,
commence on to the target.

21
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,397
And if all goes well,
we'll be back by 21:15.

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,132
In time for a late snack.

23
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,537
Finish checking your gear.

24
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,841
We'll assemble in the launch
room in nine minutes from mark.

25
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,876
All right, you heard the captain, ladies.
Move.

26
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,286
Steve.
- Yes, captain.

27
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,759
When you call me captain when no one's
around, I know something's wrong.

28
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,028
What's going on?
- Nothing.

29
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,664
Come on.
We've been friends a long time.

30
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,433
I know you better than that.

31
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,369
I got a call from Karen.
My baby is due tomorrow.

32
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,638
And I'm not going to be there.
- Captain Jefferies.

33
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,640
All engines stopped.
We are one half click from target.

34
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,674
Copy.

35
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,945
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,384
Let's go!
Move!

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,826
Check your gauges.
- Don't worry guys.

38
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,995
I'm from God's country.
We'll be safe.

39
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,364
It's showtime, baby, ha.

40
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,368
Hatch release activated.

41
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,401
All systems go.

42
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:12,552
We're close.
Do any last minute checks on gear.

43
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,156
Stay clear of these lines.

44
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,561
You heard the captain.
Be alert.

45
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,621
Careful of these trip wires.

46
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,978
Keep moving.

47
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,758
Shit.

48
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,791
I'm stuck!

49
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,162
I can't get free.

50
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,735
Joey, no!

51
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,843
He's gone. Let's go.
There's nothing we can do.

52
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,184
How you doing with that?

53
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,753
Not there yet.

54
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,356
Is it something you can fix?
- I don't know.

55
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,424
It might be these cheap wires.

56
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,760
What?

57
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,793
I said, it might be these cheap wires.

58
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,767
What about you?
- I'm done.

59
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,568
Time's up.
We've got to go.

60
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,870
Just a second.
- I don't have a second.

61
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,941
Move away from the table!
- Don't shoot! I'm unarmed.

62
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,877
Move away from the table!
- I can't.

63
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,146
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
- Where's Casper?

64
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,549
Get away from the table.
- Give us Casper.

65
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,318
Where is he?

66
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,020
He's gone.

67
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,421
He is not stupid enough to
hang around when a bomb is

68
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,324
about to explode in 15 seconds.

69
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,274
Miller, watch him.

70
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,352
Look at this.

71
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,652
Move!

72
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,232
Come on.

73
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,474
Come on!

74
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,077
We gotta go!

75
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,110
Steve.

76
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,485
Come on, let's go!
Baker, move!

77
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,093
Baker, move! Move!

78
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,371
Come on. We gotta go!

79
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,039
Go on!

80
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,441
Come on!

81
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,442
Come on!

82
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,144
Together, come on!

83
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,512
Go, go, go!

84
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,513
Come on!

85
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,515
Come on!

86
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,549
Go, go, go, go!

87
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:34,460
Come on, get moving! Move!
You've got the rear!

88
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,469
Get in the water!

89
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,413
Come on, move your ass!
- No, no, no! I don't swim.

90
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,446
I don't swim.

91
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,289
What's your name?

92
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,729
Andreas Thrasos.

93
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,899
Where's Casper? Don't give me that look.

94
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:51,336
I asked you a question.
Where is Casper?

95
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,370
Last chance.

96
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,277
Where's Casper?

97
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,212
No, no, no, no.

98
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,314
You need me.
- For what?

99
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,347
There's things I can tell you.

100
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,322
Then talk.

101
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,464
You're looking for Casper.
He's been in hiding for 10 years.

102
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,367
You think he tells me where he
goes, his servants,

103
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,703
where he goes, where he lives?

104
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,736
You think I have his address
and his phone number?

105
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,841
Then you don't mean shit to us.
Kill him.

106
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:35,314
No. Don't, don't.
Come on. Be smart.

107
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,450
I don't know where Casper is.
I know what he wants, though.

108
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,785
I could tell you that.
Be smart.

109
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:48,660
So tell us.
Tell us what he wants.

110
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,829
The Stormbringer.

111
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,266
If you find that bomb,
you'll be able to find Casper.

112
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,870
Last of the Cold War super weapons?

113
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,906
I am an explosives expert
with a physics degree.

114
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:05,244
That is a cluster bomb
with six warheads that fire

115
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,779
simultaneously on detonation.

116
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,916
A bomb like that can wipe
out six cities at once.

117
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,485
The Russians dismantled
those after the Soviet.

118
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,489
Union collapsed.
- Not all of them.

119
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,292
They kept some.
And they're selling them.

120
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,696
This one, the guerrilla Albanians
are buying, the freedom army.

121
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,598
And they want to use it to
resolve their border conflict.

122
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,767
What's Casper got to do with that?

123
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,270
Casper brokered the deal.

124
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,672
What the hell are you talking about?

125
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,908
You said find the Stormbringer
and we find Casper.

126
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,710
Now, you're telling me he sold the
goddamn thing to the Albanians?

127
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,512
You're not... You're getting it.

128
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,848
Casper needs this deal to go down.

129
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,383
Why?

130
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:50,255
Because once the Russians
deliver the bomb,

131
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:54,293
Casper will steal it from the Albanians.

132
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,262
And then, he'll sell it
to the highest bidder.

133
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,463
Relay that to intel.
Find out if it's bullshit.

134
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,542
Can you loosen these cuffs?
I can't feel my pinkie.

135
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,314
Ten-hut!

136
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,824
At ease.

137
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,294
Lieutenant, what's up with the new guys?

138
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,764
I think we're about to find out.

139
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,798
Yeah.

140
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,974
Good morning.
- Good morning, captain.

141
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,475
You can go on in.

142
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,710
The commander's expecting you.
- Thank you.

143
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,743
You're welcome.

144
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,366
Rick, good to see you.

145
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,100
Commander.

146
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,468
A drink?

147
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,802
No, thank you, sir. I'm fine.

148
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,837
That's all right.

149
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,870
Have a seat.

150
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,512
Rick, I'll cut to the chase.

151
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,383
I want you and your
men to steal that bomb.

152
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,951
The next worst thing would be for Casper

153
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,452
to get his hands on it.

154
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,521
So Casper, are we after him again?

155
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,057
If he surfaces, we'll take him out.

156
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,559
Casper is a secondary
target this time around.

157
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,062
This is not a revenge mission.

158
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,064
This is about getting the bomb.

159
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,097
And I've given you the team to do it.

160
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,103
Rogers is an expert in demo.

161
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,541
If you can't take the bomb out,
he knows how to disable it.

162
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:51,610
What's the extraction plan?

163
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,047
You'll travel via land from
Albania to camp Bondsteel.

164
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,083
Illegal op, you'll be on your own.

165
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,452
It's damn near a suicide mission.

166
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,421
Most of them are.

167
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,155
What about Jacobs?

168
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,956
What's his story?

169
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,861
A shooter, top of his class in
his Target Introduction Course.

170
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,832
In Bosnia, I got a Serb sniper from half

171
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,935
a mile away, single shot.

172
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,937
Looks like he's the only
one with combat experience.

173
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,906
He says he's still wet behind the ears,

174
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,509
wants you to hold his hand.

175
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,777
Smart kid.

176
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,547
McGee's your new communications officer,

177
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,582
Ivy League boy, watch out.

178
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,155
No, I can't take this one.

179
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,156
What?

180
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
This one, I don't want him.

181
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,525
I can't take him.

182
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,627
You have to, Rick.

183
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,563
Is that an order, sir?

184
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,864
Because I don't like to make mistakes.

185
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,033
And I sure as hell don't
like repeating them.

186
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,434
You read the report.

187
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,436
I lost good men on that island, sir.

188
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,438
And Baker might as well
pull the trigger himself.

189
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,806
Now, calm down.

190
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,110
He's a loose cannon, sir.
He's trigger happy.

191
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,878
He's gonna get us all killed.

192
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,146
I'm sorry, sir.

193
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,448
But he's bad for the team.

194
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,183
I'm pissed off enough to
kill the little bastard.

195
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,619
And I'm too pissed off
to reason through it.

196
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,021
Now, you can give me psych
leave so I can fix my head

197
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,490
or whatever.

198
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,524
But you need me now, and I'm telling you

199
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,092
I don't want him on the team.

200
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,162
Baker's father is a senator on
the Armed Services Committee.

201
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,096
Jesus.

202
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,164
Defense Appropriation.

203
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,632
Christ.

204
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:24,169
He wants his son returned to active duty.

205
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,671
I never thought you'd screw
us over politics, sir.

206
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:29,541
Politics is what pays your salary, son.

207
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,574
I'll just pretend I didn't hear that.

208
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,546
You'll need a tour guide over there.

209
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,579
Come in!

210
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,253
Hello.

211
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,988
What?

212
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,557
You can make me take Baker,
but you cannot make me take

213
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,659
this terrorist son of a bitch.

214
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,561
We told him if he didn't help us,

215
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,129
we'd make sure he died in prison.

216
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,798
I should have put a bullet
in you when I had the chance.

217
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,132
Take it easy, Rick.

218
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,736
Actually, I'm happy to see you
again, captain.

219
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,072
I didn't get a chance to
express my condolences.

220
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:01,973
You know what?

221
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,941
I just changed my mind.

222
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,709
I'll be happy to take him.

223
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,743
But I can guarantee he ain't coming back.

224
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,714
Commander.

225
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:22,091
Ten-hut!

226
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,675
I know the truth about who you are.

227
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,708
And you're a goddamn liability.

228
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,734
USS Truman, this Kilo 271

229
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,303
requesting permission to land.

230
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,905
Roger that, 271.

231
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,774
Permission granted.

232
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,877
The bomb will be delivered
by a Russian convoy

233
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,581
to a military depot in Northeast
Albania on April 13th, which

234
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,351
means we have less than 36 hours
to beat Casper to the depot

235
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,384
and steal the bomb before he does.

236
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,139
I've spotted them.

237
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,374
They're going in the water.

238
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,407
What should I do?

239
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,343
Start drop.

240
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,915
Help him.

241
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,138
Send the divers in now.

242
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,960
Right behind you.

243
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,161
, go over here.

244
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,195
Over here.

245
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,567
How many of them are there?

246
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Over here.

247
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,937
They're coming in from all sides.

248
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:04,943
I'm coming Edwards.

249
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,945
Get a read on Edwards.

250
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,978
Edwards, you out there?

251
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,331
Edwards?

252
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,000
Edwards, you OK?

253
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,303
I'm going.

254
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,337
I'm going over here.

255
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,288
We got another one over here.

256
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,891
God damn.

257
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,293
I'm going over here.

258
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,895
I need help.

259
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:57,896
I'm on my way.

260
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,929
I'm on my way.

261
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,272
I think I see another one.

262
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:21,284
You got him?

263
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,657
Hurry up.

264
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,690
That was the last one.

265
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,141
Friends of yours, Andreas?

266
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,376
I don't know who they were.

267
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,377
Yeah, right.

268
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,279
Watch him.

269
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,312
All right.

270
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Hey!

271
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,488
Sir, I don't like this at all.

272
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,823
Those are soldiers.

273
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,057
What should we do?

274
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,425
Just drive.

275
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,459
All right.

276
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:27,772
Just relax.
- All right.

277
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,805
All right. All right.

278
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,717
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?

279
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,751
No, sir.

280
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,339
Shit.

281
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,273
Keep going.

282
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,208
Keep going.

283
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,143
It's just a check point.

284
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,176
Everybody relax.

285
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,786
Captain, with your
permission, I think it might

286
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,621
be best if I did the talking.

287
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,323
You better make it damn good.

288
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,357
Look at that tank.

289
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,679
You speak Albanian well for an American.

290
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,482
I've spent a lot of time in your country.

291
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,784
Where you are going?

292
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,386
Korce?

293
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,353
Shkoder.

294
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,888
Why you go there?

295
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,324
We're UN observers.

296
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,225
Observers?

297
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,258
Yes.

298
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,795
Papers.

299
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:10,339
Cigarette?

300
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:32,561
I see driver's passport?

301
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,931
Just give it to him.

302
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,439
Thank you.

303
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,523
Hot out today, no?

304
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,292
Yes, it's been a long drive.

305
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,895
I'm not talking to you.

306
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,928
I talking to him.

307
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:17,542
I talking with Baker.

308
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,345
Yes, it's hot.

309
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,449
OK.

310
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,688
Wait here.

311
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,363
Stay cool.

312
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,575
Relax.

313
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,708
Fuck.

314
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,384
Don't do anything.

315
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,398
What the hell was that?

316
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,632
He was pushing me, sir.

317
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,667
He wasn't pushing you.

318
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,868
He was testing you.

319
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,071
You panicked and blew our cover again.

320
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,104
That's twice.

321
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,620
We got to dump this vehicle
and get rid of these uniforms

322
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,644
and get another vehicle.

323
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,057
Pull over here.

324
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,029
Miller, hot wire that van.

325
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,063
Yes, sir.

326
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,668
How close are we?

327
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,702
I'd say about another half hour.

328
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,053
Move out.

329
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,871
Last chance.

330
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,786
The package is on the way.

331
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,757
Roger, understood, make your way back.

332
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,161
Big, big truck for a bomb.

333
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,727
So how do you want to do this?

334
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,702
First, you, Baker, McGee,
and Rogers will go in

335
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,705
and lay charges in case
something goes wrong.

336
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,607
Rogers, I want you to
set a canister of gas

337
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,308
in the barracks in the back.

338
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,344
Right.

339
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,680
First light,
we'll go in and take the camp.

340
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,350
Jacobs, you're going to cover
us from that guard tower.

341
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,219
Sir, why don't we just do everything now?

342
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,854
I mean, let's get in there.

343
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,190
You want to fight the
Albanians and the Russians?

344
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,124
No, sir.

345
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,693
No, I don't either.

346
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,128
There's nothing worse
than a pissed off Russian

347
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,730
pumped full of vodka.

348
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:16,967
But, captain,
how are we going to get the bomb?

349
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,001
We're going to carry on your back.

350
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,392
Baker, heads up.

351
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,108
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

352
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,386
Get out of there, Baker.

353
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,037
McGee, on your right.

354
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,082
Miller, on the stairs.

355
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,223
You know, you didn't have to do what

356
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,256
you did back at the UN van.

357
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,561
If I didn't, we'd all be dead.

358
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,537
As much as I hate to say it, I'm gonna

359
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,570
need you when we go out there.

360
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,111
And, obviously, you know how to use it.

361
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,969
Let's go.

362
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,418
Roger, start the gas.

363
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,153
Roger that.

364
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,254
Jacobs, you set?

365
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,557
Captain, I have a shot.

366
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,292
All right, Baker?

367
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,293
Ready.

368
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,428
Miller?

369
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,662
Ready.
- McGee?

370
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,696
Ready.

371
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,266
It's done.

372
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,545
Jacobs, take the shot.

373
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,314
Take the shot, Jacobs.

374
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:52,814
God damn it! There's no keys.

375
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,403
Go! Go!

376
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,437
Go!

377
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,440
I think it would be safer if
we stay off the main roads.

378
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,299
I know of some mountain
roads that are around here.

379
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,703
But it will take us longer
to get to the border.

380
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,736
You'll be fine, man.

381
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,079
We need to stop before that.

382
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,013
Stop?

383
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,047
Baker is hurt bad.

384
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,415
He won't make it to the border.

385
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,684
We need to stop now.

386
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:18,355
There's an old quarry about
45 kilometers from here,

387
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,689
very hidden.

388
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,659
This isn't about Baker at all, is it?

389
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,692
Take us to the quarry.

390
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,710
I still don't think we should stop.

391
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,479
I don't remember asking your opinion.

392
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,514
Our mission was to get the bomb.

393
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,750
And to take Casper out if he surfaces.

394
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,018
Yeah, and you're doing everything you

395
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,819
can to make damn sure he does.

396
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,788
You know, I don't think I like
where you're going with this,

397
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:52,922
lieutenant.

398
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,958
We have to leave Casper behind.

399
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:57,069
Because of that motherfucker
my best friend is dead.

400
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,093
So don't fucking tell
me what I need to do.

401
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,809
I screwed up again, Rogers.

402
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,878
I guess I'm not cut out for this.

403
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,713
You picked a hell of a time to tell us.

404
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,482
We still got work to do.

405
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,984
You keep dragging along and you'll never

406
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,120
get this bomb out of here.

407
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:28,058
So what are you fighting for, Andreas?

408
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,493
Fighting for, you mean like a cause?

409
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,128
Sure.

410
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,664
I fight for many things, captain.

411
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,534
Casper pay you well for those things?

412
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,703
I don't do it for the money, all right?

413
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,905
I'm not a materialistic American.

414
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,407
Tell me about these
non-materialistic things you

415
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,943
feel so deeply about that you're willing

416
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:50,180
to help the world's biggest
butcher kill innocent people.

417
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,682
Wait a minute, captain, I mean, you work

418
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,417
for the American government.

419
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,755
They are much more of a butcher
than Casper will ever be.

420
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,990
I fight for democracy and human rights.

421
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,827
Why do anything without purpose?

422
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,396
Maybe we're not so different after all?

423
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,941
Pull off right up here.

424
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,882
Right up here.

425
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,629
Yeah, it's going to be one
hell of a luxury night.

426
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,172
Something ain't right here.

427
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,879
Miller, Jacobs, secure the perimeter.

428
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,147
Yes, sir.

429
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:31,848
Rogers, take Baker and go down to the...

430
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:33,881
Captain!

431
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,892
Drop your weapons!

432
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,769
Drop your weapons!

433
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,738
Drop your weapons!

434
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:56,806
Drop your weapons!

435
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,840
I said drop 'em.

436
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,658
Do it.

437
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,609
Wise decision, captain.

438
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,010
What about you?

439
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,043
Miller, drop your weapon.

440
00:58:55,832 --> 00:59:03,831
No reason to get sentimental
about such a small weapon.

441
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,176
Bitch.

442
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,612
What did you call me?

443
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:11,981
You heard me.

444
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,349
Ha!

445
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,919
Ha!

446
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,855
Ha!

447
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,758
Please, tell me again,
if you have the balls.

448
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:30,333
I said, you're a fucking bitch.

449
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,869
Ha!

450
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,902
Anya, that's enough.

451
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:41,778
You Casper?

452
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,947
You're looking for Casper?

453
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,881
Don't patronize me.

454
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,783
You know I am.

455
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:51,387
Well, you found him.

456
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,963
At ease.

457
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,966
I have never been more at ease
in my entire life, captain.

458
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,234
Thank God we are good.

459
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,268
I missed you so much, Casper.

460
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,991
Surprise.

461
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:31,060
How are you going to take me down now?

462
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:35,031
Your mission was a big success.

463
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,266
Only you were too stupid to realize it.

464
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:46,175
And poor, obedient, and scared Andreas,

465
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:48,111
can't swim, can't escape, can't do

466
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:53,249
anything without the permission
of the great, big, strong Navy.

467
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,183
Seals.

468
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,217
You piece of shit.

469
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:02,225
You be careful, lieutenant.

470
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:04,961
You're not talking to Andreas anymore.

471
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,164
You're talking to me.

472
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:11,834
And I can shoot, remember?

473
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,237
Yes.

474
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,240
All right.

475
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,308
Krozniak?

476
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,443
Yes.

477
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:21,310
Gather the trucks in the quarry.

478
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,245
We leave at dawn.

479
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,748
Cuff these assholes.

480
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,938
Put your head up, buddy.

481
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,109
There you go.

482
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:54,077
Lean back.

483
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,110
Thanks.

484
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,317
Did you bring my bag?

485
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,251
Of course.

486
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:04,285
Put it in my room.

487
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:15,865
Pretty smart kissing ass,
using us to get Stormbringer.

488
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,937
Well, it was worth it, captain.

489
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,305
It couldn't have worked out better.

490
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,374
And that commander of
yours, all he wanted

491
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,511
was a Stormbringer, a few decorations,

492
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,544
maybe make general.

493
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,916
You know what he did?

494
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,152
He let me make calls from
an unsecure phone line

495
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:37,520
the second you left.

496
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,255
Is that when you called all your sissy

497
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,958
little terrorist friends to
ambush us at the water pipe?

498
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,526
Yeah.

499
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:49,232
And that didn't work out as
planned so I had to improvise.

500
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,167
I decided to take advantage
of the phenomenal opportunity

501
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,937
and let you and your Navy
Seals steal the bomb for me.

502
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,607
You don't know me, captain.

503
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,009
I am extremely ambitious.

504
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:04,847
I'm also extremely
lazy, so I prefer to let

505
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,017
other people do the dirty work.

506
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,418
The guerrillas will kill you when they

507
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,453
find out what you did to them.

508
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,354
You know that.

509
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,222
The Albanians?

510
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,892
The Albanians are incapable
of running a gas station,

511
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,860
much less a government, captain.

512
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,062
But you arranged for them to buy it.

513
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,598
Yes, and lose it.

514
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,435
I'm doing the world a favor, captain.

515
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,904
But I'll let you take all the credit.

516
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,472
I'm sure you will.

517
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,242
You are an imperial Yankee on
a search-and-destroy mission

518
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,378
in a third-world country.

519
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:39,282
And when they find your bodies,
they'll have all the evidence

520
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,951
of your atrocities.

521
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,420
I'll be sneaking away
quietly with the bomb.

522
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,255
Why wait?

523
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,449
Why don't you just go ahead
and kill us all right now?

524
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,095
What are you using it for?

525
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:55,665
In a few hours,
the bomb will be lowered into a trawler

526
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,698
in the port city of Durres.

527
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:03,172
And in 10 days,
it will sail into a harbor

528
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,541
on the east coast of America where

529
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,575
it will detonate, captain.

530
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,679
What do you get out of it?

531
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,271
Perfect, man, just perfect.

532
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,573
We are so fucked.

533
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,443
Damn it.
- You look like shit.

534
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,949
Blind date, she didn't like me much.

535
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:55,191
How you feeling?

536
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,392
Never better.

537
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,962
Can't you smell it?

538
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,330
What, that?

539
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:04,300
Yeah.

540
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:08,337
Hell, that's...

541
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,438
That's me.

542
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,472
It's a long line for the shower.

543
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,547
It's gangrene, bleeding internally.

544
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,651
My leg is about to rot off.

545
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,684
Look at it.

546
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,380
I'm gonna go see about the captain, OK?

547
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:53,414
Yeah.

548
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,128
What's going on?

549
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:19,575
Stevie looked up to me his whole life,

550
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:20,676
became a Seal because I did.

551
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:24,246
He thought it was cool.

552
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,684
I tried to tell him not
to, but he joined anyway.

553
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:02,418
He was a damn good Seal,
did his job like he was told

554
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:07,189
and he never panicked and
saved my life in the process.

555
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:22,238
God damn, I just keep seeing his face,

556
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,839
the way he was looking
at me before he died.

557
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:28,511
It's like a fucking movie over
and over in my head, you know?

558
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,380
Part of the job, Rick.

559
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:32,748
We all know that.

560
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,782
He was my best friend.

561
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:40,256
And you were right.

562
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,624
Ever since then, all I wanted to do

563
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,493
is get Casper, that mother fucker.

564
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,495
I jeopardized the mission.

565
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,764
And I jeopardized my men.

566
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:53,135
How we fucked up doesn't matter.

567
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:57,273
Question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

568
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:20,763
Captain Jefferies, if you please.

569
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,587
Anya, you stay.

570
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,620
, let's go.

571
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,375
Ready to leave?

572
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,777
Soon.

573
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,714
They're talking.

574
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,949
There's one guard on them.

575
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,284
Revenge, captain.

576
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,317
What?

577
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,490
You asked what I get out of it.

578
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,524
Revenge for what?

579
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:33,569
Five years ago in
Belgrade during the war,

580
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:39,742
I had a beautiful wife, Biara,
and a wonderful little boy,

581
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,844
Milos.

582
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:46,248
We lived in an apartment on
the outskirts of the city.

583
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:47,783
On the night of the American
bombing, my son,

584
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,318
he heard a loud crash outside.

585
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,886
So he runs out into the courtyard.

586
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,922
And there below his window is a cylinder

587
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,624
half-buried in the dirt.

588
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:59,895
Now, I imagine to the boy it
looked like a rocket ship.

589
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,530
Smart bomb?

590
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:04,400
Yeah, a smart bomb designed
to hit military targets.

591
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,968
Now, this place where these people lived,

592
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:10,973
these innocent people,
my wife, my son, apparently

593
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,675
was the target of some considerable

594
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,910
military significance.

595
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,413
Imagine that, captain.

596
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,281
My wife, she heard the
boy out in the courtyard.

597
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,449
So she runs out there.

598
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,351
And I suppose it was about that time

599
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:26,055
that the bomb started ticking again.

600
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:31,460
Wiped out the whole block,
my wife, my only son.

601
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:34,830
You asked me why.

602
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:40,336
Well, now I ask you,
Captain Jefferies, why?

603
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,770
Why did that happen?

604
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:45,040
In every war and every
battle, innocent people die.

605
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,642
It happens?

606
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,011
Not to my fucking wife
and kid it doesn't happen!

607
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,913
Your fucking hypocritical
government murders

608
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,414
numerous innocent people.

609
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,783
But it's OK, it's for a cause.

610
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,319
They are my fucking cause, captain!

611
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,922
That is my fucking cause.

612
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,657
You don't pretend you don't understand

613
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,690
because I've been watching you.

614
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,598
I understand the desire.

615
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,468
But I also understand that
revenge perpetuates revenge.

616
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,710
Take him back to his cell.

617
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:40,794
There's a couple of guys
loading stuff into Jeeps.

618
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:46,368
Looks like some of them are
going to move out tonight.

619
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,102
How many?

620
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,406
How many trucks?

621
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,007
Why?
- Tell me how many.

622
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,041
How many trucks?

623
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:02,551
Listen, I'm not going to
make it out of here, guys.

624
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:03,585
That's bull shit man.

625
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,721
You're going to be just fine.

626
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,389
Bull shit.

627
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,458
There's nothing you guys can do for me.

628
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,491
All right, Baker.

629
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,429
You're dying.

630
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,538
What do you want to do?

631
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:27,609
Well, if you guys want
to get out of here,

632
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,713
you're going to need a distraction.

633
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:35,584
I... I think I've got one.

634
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:05,748
The trucks are ready.

635
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,117
We should get moving.

636
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,153
Relax, Krozniak.

637
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,186
Have a drink.

638
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,104
To success.

639
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,138
Not yet.

640
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,744
It will only be a success
when the Americans

641
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:36,979
know what it's like to lose everything

642
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,815
they love in a single blast.

643
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,184
I don't understand this
passion for revenge.

644
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,690
The Saudis are willing to pay
as much more money for the bomb.

645
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,529
It's never been about the money.

646
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,738
It has been so long since
you lost your family.

647
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,877
You don't care that you will be hunted

648
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,911
for the rest of your life?

649
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,788
Yeah.

650
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,822
Are you sure it's worth the risk?

651
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:45,212
Move!

652
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,349
Move!

653
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,127
Hurry up.

654
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,062
Hurry up!

655
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,597
Come on.

656
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,031
Come on, Baker.
- Come on.

657
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:04,032
Baker's got an idea.

658
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,033
What?

659
01:15:05,067 --> 01:15:07,067
Yeah.

660
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,339
Come on, move, move, move, move, move.

661
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:11,340
Let's go.

662
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:12,274
Clear!

663
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,308
Go, go.

664
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,576
Come on, Baker.

665
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,610
You can make it.

666
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,801
Casper, you need to come downstairs.

667
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,834
We have a problem.

668
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:34,156
Hi-ya!

669
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,758
Hyah!

670
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,161
Ha!

671
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:55,143
No.

672
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:56,211
No.

673
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:58,244
No.

674
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,064
What about the bomb?

675
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,132
We can't get to it.

676
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:19,165
Get in the truck, now!

677
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:32,447
Fuck, they did it again.

678
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,481
They did it again!

679
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:47,863
Our Father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

680
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:51,233
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.

681
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:59,241
On earth as it is in heaven.

682
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,877
Thy will be done.

683
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,923
Amen.

684
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,819
Let's move out.

685
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,133
Go!

686
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,166
Go!

687
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,613
Go!

688
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,127
Get to the dock!

689
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:08,501
Jacobs, take out the driver!

690
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:15,108
Sweep the area and head for the docks.

691
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,417
Shit!

692
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:12,694
Truck went in right over there.

693
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:13,695
Where's Casper?

694
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,196
I nailed him.

695
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,132
Find Miller and Rogers
and come back here.

696
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,165
Yes, sir.

697
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:35,630
Nailed him, did you?

698
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:37,663
Man, I hit him dead center.

699
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,270
Do something with this.

700
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:16,271
You got a plan?

701
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,304
No, you?

702
01:26:29,984 --> 01:26:31,984
Make that a yes.

703
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:52,974
Casper, Zodiac approaching.

704
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:57,979
Ready?

705
01:26:58,012 --> 01:26:58,980
Yes.

706
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:01,013
Now!

707
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:31,746
Pretty good idea.

708
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,779
Thanks.

709
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:51,032
Take your time, really.

710
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:55,103
Hey, it's nice to see you guys.

711
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,136
Come on.

712
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:21,062
They're putting Baker up
for the Medal of Honor.

713
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:21,996
They should.

714
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:23,498
He deserves it.

715
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,099
He did a lot of growing
up on this mission,

716
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,001
surprised a lot of people, especially me.

717
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,136
I know.

718
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:30,004
That's what I put in your report.

719
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:33,775
But the senator wants to
know what really happened,

720
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:34,809
off the record.

721
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,577
Yeah, politics again, right?

722
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:38,046
I don't think so.

723
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,015
If it was politics,
he wouldn't have asked.

724
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:42,817
I'll tell you exactly what
happened, commander.

725
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:44,152
Ten-hut.

726
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:46,854
Baker sacrificed his
life for the mission.

727
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,389
His father should be damn proud of him.

728
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,957
He died like a man.

729
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,526
All right, Captain Jefferies, that's

730
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:53,995
exactly what I'll tell him.

731
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,028
He'll be proud to hear it.

732
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:04,906
Rick.

733
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,939
Commander.

734
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,009
At ease.

735
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,149
I don't know about you boys,
but I'm ready for a beer,

736
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,752
maybe 10.

737
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:18,820
Got any money?

738
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:20,853
Jesus.

739
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:27,128
Hey, I'll buy you a beer,
get Rogers a stick of gum.

740
01:29:27,161 --> 01:29:31,165
Yup, another beautiful day in the Navy.
