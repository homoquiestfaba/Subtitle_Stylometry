00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,253
[wheels squeaking]

3
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,010
I don't know why you were
in such a hurry

4
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,112
to get this stuff
in storage tonight.

5
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,947
Just needed to be done.

6
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,483
Okay...if you say so.

7
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,818
Come here.

8
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,585
What?

9
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,187
Come here.

10
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,058
[giggling]
What?

11
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,801
Okay, what are you doing?

12
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:50,702
Shh...

13
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,671
You're so bad!

14
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,040
Shh, it's gonna be okay.

15
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,051
Donovan!

16
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,819
Paul is full of shit!

17
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:12,724
He's a low-down
dirty bastard and
should be disbarred.

18
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,693
It doesn't matter!

19
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,564
Scum like that are the
reason why people
don't trust lawyers.

20
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,701
Dude, I'm telling ya...
Get it right, or you're done!

21
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,603
Okay.

22
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,242
Hey, Chris...

23
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:36,215
Have I ever told you
how much I appreciate
all the shit

24
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,150
you've gone through
to move all this crap?!

25
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:39,585
No problem, Mr. Morgan.

26
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,552
Chris...

27
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,821
How long you been
with the company?

28
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,156
Eight years, sir.

29
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,492
Eight years!
Oh God...

30
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:50,662
Time flies by when
you're having fun.

31
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:53,065
We can't do this here...

32
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,301
It's gonna be okay.

33
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,710
Come on, silly.
Let's just get the stuff done

34
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:05,877
and go home.

35
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,580
Shh, it's gonna be okay.

36
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,517
Hello?!

37
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,419
Hello!

38
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,622
Yeah...

39
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:20,092
Oh, my reception's bad
'cause I'm at my
storage place.

40
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,527
I'll call you back!

41
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,801
You know Chris,
I appreciate all the hard
work that you do?

42
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,536
Yes, sir.

43
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,805
I knew you were up
for a promotion.

44
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,974
Yep!

45
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,644
Chris...

46
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,747
Times have been difficult.

47
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:45,384
And there was only one
promotion spot available...

48
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:49,721
And you know what?
I had to give it to Scott.

49
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:50,989
Now...

50
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,058
You're a lot
more trustworthy,

51
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,460
And you're a harder
working guy.

52
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,095
But there was just
something about Scott

53
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,666
that jumped out at me.
I had to grab him.

54
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:03,302
And I hope you understand.

55
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,269
Yeah...

56
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,804
I understand.

57
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:10,676
And please, know that it had
nothing at all to him
being...

58
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,344
my nephew.

59
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,979
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,750
Feels good, don't it?

61
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,751
Sir?

62
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,522
Feels good to know
that your boss...

63
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:26,258
appreciates what you
do and acknowledges it.

64
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,760
Feels good, don't it?!

65
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,363
Yes, sir.
Feels good.

66
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,031
Feels good.

67
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,600
Feels good.

68
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,669
Feels good.

69
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,338
Gimme a minute, Chris.

70
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,006
Hello, hello?!

71
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,507
No, can't hear you!

72
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,711
Shit, I've got no reception!
Hang on, I'll be right there!

73
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,586
[muffled voice]

74
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,967
Hey!
You okay?

75
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,959
Hey, Chris?!

76
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,195
Hey, Chris!

77
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,197
Man, where are ya?!

78
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,400
Chris!
Where are ya, man?!

79
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,035
I gotta go!

80
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,062
Come on, Chris!
I gotta go!

81
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,465
That's enough of this shit!

82
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,972
[screaming in pain]

83
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,111
[scurrying and growling]

84
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,815
Oh God, no!
[screaming incoherently]

85
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,585
No, no!

86
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:10,489
Somebody!

87
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,995
Feels good, don't it?

88
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,102
Feels good, don't it?!

89
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,107
Somebody!
No!

90
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,944
Help me!
Somebody!

91
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,288
Feels good, don't it?

92
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,629
[screaming]

93
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,177
Come on,
we can't do this here.

94
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,613
It's gonna be okay.

95
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,484
I wanna go home now.

96
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,086
It's gonna be okay.

97
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,154
Come on...

98
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,689
It's gonna be okay.

99
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,690
Honey...

100
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,959
It's gonna be okay.

101
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,464
[heavy metal music d]

102
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,216
[roaring and feeding]

103
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,746
Come on!

104
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,190
Come on, you guys!

105
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,259
So, Mike, what I'm trying
to say is that this
semester--

106
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,428
[girl]
The demon stone...

107
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,565
How we gonna get in there?

108
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:17,102
We're gonna take it.
We're just gonna grab it.

109
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,270
It's all around
12 thousand pounds.

110
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,474
But how we gonna move it
if it's that heavy?

111
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,410
How we gonna move it?

112
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,912
So, what?
Now you're telling me
you're afraid of demons?

113
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,416
Uh no, what I'm trying
to tell you is that
we don't have time

114
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,085
to be chasing rainbows
this semester, Mike.

115
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,421
Why not?!
That's what we do!

116
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,457
Come on, we're thrillseekers!
That's what life is all about!

117
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,561
Yeah look, I would rather
go chasing rainbows...

118
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:48,299
than just sit around
waiting to say "bingo"
and keel over.

119
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,370
Now look, the three of us,
we have hit up caves
in the Congo.

120
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,706
Come on, we've surfed
in Acapulco!

121
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,543
We have climbed and
skydived damn near every
spot from here to Tahoe.

122
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,211
And now you're telling me
you're afraid
of some legend.

123
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:04,449
Focus on your thesis, Michael.
Not another crazy scheme!

124
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,218
It's not crazy.

125
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,720
Lemme get this straight then.

126
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,389
You wanna go into this
underground storage facility

127
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,925
and go through these old
tunnels just to find
some stolen

128
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,227
grave statues?
- Ah no, no...

129
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,230
Priceless stolen
grave statues.

130
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,399
You probably don't even
know they're down there!

131
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,737
Yes, I do!
Look, I am in with the guy
who works there!

132
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:28,406
He doesn't know
what he has.

133
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,908
Mike, if this was so easy,

134
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,609
how come you haven't
gone down there
yourself already?

135
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,211
I would've...

136
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,115
But I need your help.

137
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,783
Look you guys,
this time I promise.

138
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:43,121
I promise there is a pot
of gold at the end
of the rainbow.

139
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,424
Mike, if you were a midget
in a green costume..

140
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:50,094
And had four-leaf clovers
spewing out of your ass...

141
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,764
I still wouldn't
believe that shit!

142
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:55,266
And it sounds dangerous,
anyway!

143
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,434
It's not dangerous!

144
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,101
How do you know?!

145
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,237
[laughing]
Okay...

146
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:04,175
"The Demon Stones
of the Ontume, major
archaeological treasure,

147
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,544
were stolen from
the Museum of
Science and Industry.

148
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,447
Anonymous tip led police
to a warehouse where
they discovered

149
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,284
mutilated bodies...
of numerous suspects,

150
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,320
but the artifacts
were never recovered."

151
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,654
Okay...

152
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,889
[laughing]
Okay!

153
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,457
There's more...

154
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,127
"Hieroglyphics have linked
the ancient tribe
to partake in...

155
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,397
human sacrifice
and demon worship.

156
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,201
Legend states the stones
whistle when covered
with blood.

157
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,070
This however,
has never been proven."

158
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:36,207
Okay, okay, so...
It's creepy...

159
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,144
But it's not dangerous.

160
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,880
Okay Mike...

161
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:45,083
So we just go down there
and we see if these
things whistle.

162
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,751
That's it, right?

163
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,353
Yes, yes!

164
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,755
And I know that
deep down inside...

165
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,657
you wanna know, too!

166
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,058
Michael, what is this?

167
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,426
Is this a joke?!

168
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,995
You know I don't like
messing around
with voodoo,

169
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,830
and crap like this!

170
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,431
Kendra, you're really
that scared?

171
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:03,501
No, I just don't want to end
up on the front page
of the newspaper!

172
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,336
Not going to!

173
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,506
Look, all I need you to do
is navigate me and Floyd

174
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,676
through the tunnels
and help us pull it out!

175
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,845
Then we go
to the museum...

176
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,214
Cash in...

177
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,717
And Kendra...

178
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,985
I know your parents
could use the money.

179
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,520
Hey, come on, man, look...

180
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:27,926
Kendra, you don't have
to do this if you don't
want to, okay?

181
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:29,027
Whatever...

182
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,297
You guys both know
my dad lost his job.

183
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:37,035
And my mom's stressed
about losing the house.

184
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,339
This could help.

185
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,145
So we're all in?

186
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,113
Looks like it.

187
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,483
All right, it's settled.

188
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,353
[thud]

189
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,059
[thuds continue]

190
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,033
[man]
Feels good, don't it?

191
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,550
[screaming]

192
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:34,625
Look, we're closing up.
I'm not gonna go upstairs
to cut a lock.

193
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,327
Oh really?!
Like an extra 10 minutes

194
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,129
is really gonna kill you?!
Honesty?!

195
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,831
- Sorry ladies, but--

196
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,967
Listen, listen, we really
need to get the stuff
out of the locker.

197
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,769
Well then,
where's your key?

198
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,271
I told you, it's lost!

199
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,140
Look, we're gonna
be super quick!

200
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,475
Look, I've been here
all day today, all right?

201
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,510
Come back tomorrow.

202
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,015
[mockingly]
Come back tomorrow!

203
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,018
Oh, such a hard day!

204
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,086
[softly]
Fucking idiot.

205
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,933
What are you doing?

206
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,042
[mouthing words]
Let's go.

207
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,021
Hey, are you feeling okay?

208
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,524
What?!
- I don't know, did you
take your pills today?

209
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,858
What?!

210
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,693
Yeah, I took my pills!

211
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,830
'Cause you're just acting a
little snappy, little on
edge.

212
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,865
Oh my God!
Dana, the guy was an ass!

213
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,435
There's nothing wrong
with me!
- Okay, but did you take--

214
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,036
Of course I did!

215
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,738
Yeah!

216
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,041
I did!
I promise, I promise I did!

217
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,010
Yeah!

218
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,979
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

219
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,595
Fuck!

220
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,443
Fuck!

221
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,220
Greg, I appreciate the
concern, but I'm cool.

222
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,558
You sure, 'cause we can
talk about anything, bro?

223
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,228
Yes, I'm all right.

224
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,131
Okay, well, I'm not trying
to play psychologist
or anything--

225
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,665
Greg!

226
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,602
Look, I just wanna get
this stuff stored away
and be done.

227
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,203
Okay?

228
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,772
Yeah, that's why I'm helping.

229
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,307
Good...

230
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,147
Hey T, you sure you
don't wanna talk, bro?

231
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,048
I said I'm fine!

232
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,316
Okay, if you're cool...

233
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,152
Yes, I'm cool!

234
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,423
[engine idling]

235
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,800
So how'd you find out
about this place?

236
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,769
Connections...

237
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:33,804
Ready?

238
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,939
Yeah.

239
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,774
Yo, Big Mike!

240
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,310
What's the deal, chief?
I thought you got
the stuff out yesterday?

241
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:43,181
No, no, I had to bring
a little extra muscle.

242
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,283
Well, you coulda asked
me for help.

243
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,185
Guys, Franco.

244
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,519
Hey, Floyd.

245
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,021
Kendra.
- Pleasure to meet you.

246
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,190
Well, come on,
walk with me.

247
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,057
Whoa, whoa, hold up.

248
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,226
So you came yesterday?!

249
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,295
Yeah!

250
00:19:57,297 --> 00:20:00,064
Just to check things out.

251
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,000
He didn't say that.
- He didn't, no.

252
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,136
[Mike]
Come on!

253
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,713
See we're going
for a world record here...

254
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,252
Can always make more
than one trip, bro.

255
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,757
So uh...

256
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,327
We're gonna catch
the game later, right?

257
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,098
Dude...

258
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,767
What're you doing?

259
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,570
Sorry, I was just looking
at--
- Greg!

260
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,239
I just wanna get
this stuff stored away.

261
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,341
Can we focus on that?

262
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,376
Yeah, that's why I'm helping.
- Good!

263
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,845
So let's finish this, okay?

264
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,480
Okay.

265
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,099
I mean, look at all this
clothes everywhere, it's like

266
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:12,603
people just throw stuff
away wherever!

267
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,139
You know, I should just...

268
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:22,313
You know, I think I should
pick it up and take it
to a homeless shelter.

269
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:26,317
Dana, will you hurry up?!
I don't have all day for
this!

270
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,320
I know but people,
they don't care about stuff,
so I just--

271
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,621
Yes they do!

272
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,357
But they only care
about themselves!

273
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,261
You know, that guy
is gonna be pissed!

274
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,329
Who?

275
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,664
The attendant.

276
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,833
Screw him, he was an
absolute asshole anyway.

277
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,736
[thud]

278
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,405
What was that?

279
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,309
People...

280
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,812
Jackass!

281
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,748
You know what?
I hope you take a chill pill

282
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,417
when you leave, 'cause
you know how you are.

283
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,218
Whatever!

284
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,589
[feeding sounds,
creature squeaking]

285
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,366
So Mike, how much you
think you're gonna

286
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,768
get for whatever stuff's
in the trunk?

287
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,537
Let's just say you might
wanna start uh,

288
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,105
thinking about
early retirement.

289
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:23,574
Oh, I'm gonna like this!

290
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,459
So, how old is this place?

291
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:44,228
Oh, it's been around
since the 1920's.

292
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,364
How far does this
thing go down?

293
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:50,201
Nine stories deep
underground, my friend.

294
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:53,471
This guy's just about
freaking out everyone.

295
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,539
I don't know...
Are there stairs?

296
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,842
Stairs?
Who needs stairs?

297
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,044
What do you do if
this thing breaks down?

298
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:04,382
Oh, Betsy here,
she's never broken down.

299
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,283
Not once...

300
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,428
Welcome to Alcatraz.

301
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,445
Okay, just one more trip.

302
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,349
Dude, this place
is about to close!

303
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,851
He won't mind if we grab
a few more things.

304
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,124
Can I say something without
you flying off the hinge,
bro?

305
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,528
Why are you making it
seem like I'm so unstable?

306
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,530
Because you are.

307
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,266
I'm serious, T!

308
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,834
Okay, what?!

309
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,971
At some point, you have
to move on, bro.

310
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,908
Greg, I really think we
shouldn't talk about
this right now.

311
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,075
It's been almost two years.

312
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,444
Dude, let's go!

313
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,812
You couldn't control
what happened!

314
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:11,048
Do you know how you
sound right now?!

315
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,584
Okay, I'm sorry
for being a hump!

316
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:16,921
I'm not saying that.
- Then what are
you saying?!

317
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:20,124
Todd,
we're like brothers, man.

318
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,792
I just don't want you
to wander around like

319
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,394
you're about to jump off
a fucking cliff!

320
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:25,529
I'm emotional, okay?!

321
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,468
People don't just die
and you turn the page,
like some robot!

322
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,474
If you ever cared about
anybody in your life,
you'd relate to that.

323
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,454
Daddy loves you,
too, baby girl.

324
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,023
Of course I miss you.

325
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,461
Oh baby, why you crying?

326
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,030
No, wipe those tears away.

327
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,001
Daddy's gonna
get a new job...

328
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,202
[creature snarling]

329
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,871
And then we're gonna
be able to get a house.

330
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,607
And then we'll
all be together!

331
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,579
Of course Shaggy
can come!

332
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,749
Amanda?

333
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,584
Hello?!

334
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,920
Amanda?

335
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,922
Hello--
Hi!

336
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,356
Yeah sweetie.

337
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,692
Daddy gets bad reception.

338
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:04,995
His cell phone doesn't work
well inside this place.

339
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,432
Amanda?
Hello?!

340
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,504
Sweetie, daddy'll have
to call you tomorrow.

341
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,506
I love you, too.

342
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,849
Shit!

343
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,363
What the...

344
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,637
Hey!

345
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,173
[screaming]

346
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,879
[creature feeding]

347
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,049
[roaring]

348
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,656
All right!

349
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,425
Here it is!

350
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,829
And uh,
remember my split.

351
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,631
You know it.
- All right.

352
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:23,333
All right look, I gotta lock
shop and kick people out!

353
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,868
Just check in with me,
all right?

354
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,037
'Cause I don't wanna lock
you in here on accident.

355
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,341
They couldn't pick
a different name for this
place besides Alcatraz?

356
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,577
Sweetheart,
this place is a prison.

357
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,680
It's underground, concrete
walls, and steel doors.

358
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,682
Once it automatically
shuts down,

359
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,751
nobody, and I mean nobody,

360
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:43,787
get in or out.

361
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,391
Well that's just great!

362
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,794
Come on.
Let's do this!

363
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,747
Rachel, I think we should
come back tomorrow, okay?

364
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,417
No, I just wanna get this
done and get it done today!

365
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,686
I know, but what if he--

366
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:18,889
Rachel?
Rachel!

367
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:19,723
Rachel!!

368
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,426
What?!
Fuck!!

369
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,413
I wish I woulda
never met him.

370
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,415
Cheating bastard.

371
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:50,320
I know, but this is the way
it is when someone
you love hurts you.

372
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,793
Yeah, I guess.

373
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,227
Listen...

374
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,497
It's gonna be okay!

375
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,679
Oh my God.
Shit.

376
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,516
We better get outta here!

377
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,688
Thanks.

378
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,631
Hey!

379
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,667
Dude, you see this?

380
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:37,868
Yeah, what about it?

381
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,869
Look!

382
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,871
People rushing.

383
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:43,941
Dude!

384
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,709
Chill all right, I'm just
looking for some ID.

385
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,845
Can we keep moving and
leave that for the janitor?

386
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,680
No, I'm taking this
to the front.

387
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,849
All right,
do whatever you want.

388
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,817
See?

389
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,986
Some sexy supermodel
lost her purse

390
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:58,522
and she's gonna give
me a big reward for it.

391
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,456
[blowing kisses]

392
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,458
Keep dreaming.

393
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,972
[breathing heavily]

394
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,580
Fuck!

395
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,917
You see that?

396
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,285
Yeah.

397
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,754
Let's go.

398
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,880
Mike, gimme the
walkie-talkie.

399
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:59,850
Gimme the fucking walkie!

400
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:01,618
[beep]

401
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,126
[catching breath]
How far is that opening,
Kendra?

402
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:11,328
It should be getting close.

403
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,631
Come on.

404
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,138
This place gives
me the creeps.

405
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,374
Alcatraz...

406
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:28,745
Yeah, that'll keep the
customers rollin' in.

407
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,447
Geez.

408
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,816
God.

409
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,885
How much further?!

410
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,255
Maybe thirty feet.

411
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,057
God dammit.

412
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,091
Come on.

413
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,893
Gotta keep going.

414
00:32:55,974 --> 00:33:00,577
[electricity crackling]
Okay, what is wrong
with the lights?

415
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,779
Dane, come on.

416
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,815
I'm gonna go this way.

417
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,988
Are you sure?

418
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,823
Yeah!

419
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,668
What's up with the lights?

420
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,269
I don't know.

421
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,283
[creature snarling]

422
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,135
There!

423
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,370
Look!

424
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,805
Fuck, you weren't
kidding man!

425
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,040
Hey, Floyd, Floyd.
- What?!

426
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,075
Wait, stop, stop.
- What?!

427
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,009
[sniffs]

428
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,978
What the fuck is it?!

429
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,013
Can you smell
those clover leaves?

430
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,582
Shut the fuck up!
[both laughing]

431
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,818
Oh God!
Pot of gold!

432
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,319
Holy shit!
- Pot of gold, baby!

433
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,155
Let's get this thing
outta here.

434
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,189
Let's go, let's go!

435
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,258
Latch it up.

436
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:24,995
Tie this bitch up.

437
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:27,664
Kendra, we got it!

438
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,499
[celebrating]

439
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,736
Dana, relax!

440
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:36,006
Okay, I'm not comfortable
wandering around
this maze!

441
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,207
We're fine!

442
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,877
Yeah, we're on the wrong
side of the building!

443
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,013
Look, there's the stairs
right there.

444
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,514
Ha!!

445
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:46,950
Wooh!

446
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,322
What?!

447
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,292
This was the door.

448
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,296
I think we're locking in!

449
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:00,764
Dana, we're not locked in!

450
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,302
We're just-- We're just
at the wrong door!

451
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,204
Rachel...

452
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,773
What?

453
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,375
I just saw something.

454
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,377
You what?

455
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:16,913
I just saw something move.

456
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,248
Where?

457
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,117
Down there.

458
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,890
The lights?

459
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:30,660
And your eyes.
They can play tricks on you.

460
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,630
Make things appear
to be moving.

461
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,537
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go!

462
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:55,152
You were right man,
this was cake.

463
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:58,421
I tell you, baby.
It's all good!

464
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,293
Mike, let's open this
bad boy up, man.

465
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:07,364
Where's the blood?
I know you brought some.

466
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:09,633
Can we please not do that?

467
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,168
Come on, Chicken Little...

468
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,937
Why don't you wait
for the sky to fall first?

469
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,706
Why am I always the only
voice of reason?

470
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,142
[making clucking sounds]

471
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,310
Mike, where are
the cutters, man?

472
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:21,545
Thought you were
supposed to bring 'em.

473
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:24,047
No, I specifically said
for you to bring them!

474
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,850
It doesn't matter, because
we can open it outside!

475
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,218
Thank God!

476
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,020
Let's go!

477
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,189
All right, whatever.

478
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:33,957
Let's get this
bad boy outta here.

479
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,225
Change of plans...

480
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:36,459
What?

481
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,295
[Kendra]
What're you talking about?

482
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,130
Museum doesn't open
'til Monday.

483
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,164
We're gonna leave it here.

484
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,465
What are you
talking about?!

485
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:43,533
This is a joke, right?!

486
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,536
No, Franco hooked me up
with a unit.

487
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,470
It's perfect.

488
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,206
That wasn't a part
of the plan!

489
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,807
- You never said anything!
- But what am I gonna
fucking do Floyd?!

490
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,677
Am I gonna leave it in my
closet over the weekend?
- Sure!

491
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,512
Look Kendra,
Alcatraz is the safest place.

492
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:56,580
It's the smartest choice.

493
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:58,348
No, you never said
anything about this!

494
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,084
I don't fucking care because
it's my plan, okay?!

495
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:04,087
- We're all here together
now!
- Guys, calm down!!

496
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,655
Calm down, man.

497
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:08,491
Whatever, we'll figure
this out later.

498
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,331
Fine.

499
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,269
Need some
fresh air anyway.

500
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,973
Get this outta here.

501
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,456
[electricity crackling]

502
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,993
These lights are really
starting to freak me out.

503
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,435
Still don't get why we're
leaving this shit here, man.

504
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:53,703
It's your call.

505
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:57,307
Looks like you're just
gonna have to trust me.

506
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,276
If I had a dollar for every
time you said that,

507
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,211
I'd own a fucking
Maserati, Mike.

508
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:04,481
Well I don't know about you
guys, but I'm ready to leave.

509
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,649
Agreed!

510
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,952
All right, follow me...

511
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:21,264
Mike, none of these exit
signs lead anywhere, man!

512
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,267
Where the fuck are we
even trying to go?!

513
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,769
It's a big place...

514
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,469
All looks the same.

515
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,771
We need to find Franco!

516
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:28,638
We is he?

517
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,507
Franco's around.
He's around!

518
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:31,474
He's around.

519
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,109
Look everything--
- Franco!!

520
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:35,178
Franco!!
- Floyd!

521
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,280
Stop yelling.

522
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,281
Okay, look...

523
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,582
We need to come up
with a plan, man.

524
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:42,285
We're just wandering
aimlessly right now.

525
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,520
What do you wanna do?
We gotta go forward.

526
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:44,988
We gotta keep going.

527
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,323
How do you know which--
- You wanna go back
this way?

528
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,158
Hello?
- Is that what
you wanna do?

529
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,958
Do you have any bars?

530
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,460
I can't keep a signal!

531
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:51,761
Let's go back
the way we came.

532
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,829
Let's go back
the way we came!

533
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,999
Why?!
- We just came
from that way!

534
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,300
Follow me.

535
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,602
But you don't know where--
- Please, just trust me.

536
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,338
[scoffs]
- We came from this way.

537
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,173
We know there's an exit
right where we were before.

538
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,374
But there's an exit sign
there and th--

539
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,142
I'm sure there are
exit signs everywhere!

540
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,778
There haven't been doing
us a fucking shit bit
of good so far.

541
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,980
We don't know this way.
We don't know this area.

542
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,283
Let's go back to where
we're fucking from...

543
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:14,617
And then we'll just...

544
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,720
We'll keep looking around.
Try some doors, please?

545
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,288
Please, you guys?
- Let's just-- We've--

546
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,557
We don't wanna
go this way.
- Quit arguing.

547
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,792
Let's stop.
It's not gonna do any good.

548
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,396
Trust me, trust me...
- Just shut up!

549
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,431
Floyd, come on.

550
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,470
Dude, we need
to come up with a plan.
- See, look!

551
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:34,971
We just came through there!

552
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:37,607
What are you
talking about, man?!

553
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:46,983
[metal door clanging,
electricity crackling]

554
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,620
Ah man,
what the fuck now?!

555
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,263
[electricity crackling]

556
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,000
Un-fucking-believable!

557
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:07,537
I guess the name isn't
on tap for tonight, bro.

558
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,240
I've got some flashlights
back in the locker.

559
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:13,410
How we gonna find
our way back there?

560
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,911
Hang on...

561
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,450
This finally came in handy.

562
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,589
[cart rolling]

563
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:31,828
Please, please.

564
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,766
No, no, what do you mean?
No, no!

565
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,903
Mike, this is the fifth fucking
door we've tried, man!

566
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,404
You don't know where
the fuck we're going!

567
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:42,405
Hello?

568
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,141
Hello, Lisa,
can you hear me?

569
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,443
Lisa?
- Kendra, you're not gonna

570
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,611
get a fucking signal
down here!
You know that!

571
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:49,913
All right...

572
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:53,216
Look, everything's gonna
be fine, okay?

573
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,652
Dude, this is not okay!

574
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,420
I mean, what the fuck is
wrong with these lights?

575
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,889
Huh?
Huh?!

576
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,493
Hello, can anyone
hear us?!!

577
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,429
Now I need you to relax.
All right?

578
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:07,797
Now Franco knows
we're down here.

579
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,999
Franco?
Dude, are you okay?

580
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,100
Yeah, I'm fine.

581
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,836
'Cause you've been
acting really weird.

582
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,571
Are you sure you're okay?

583
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,840
Yes, I am fine.

584
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,107
I need you guys to relax.

585
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,576
Come on, Franco,
he knows--

586
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:21,478
Franc--
Mike, this is bullshit!!

587
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,613
You relax, Floyd.

588
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:26,483
Now, I need you to relax.

589
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:30,587
Okay?
Because getting upset is not
going to help anything.

590
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:33,289
Mike, how do we get locked
here in the first place, huh?

591
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,525
I thought Franco said
he wasn't gonna
leave us in here!

592
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,494
And he hasn't!

593
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,297
You guys, I'm gonna
get us out of here.

594
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,266
I'm gonna get us
out of here.

595
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:44,300
Now, come on.

596
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,936
Come on, let's just go.
Let's go.

597
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,439
[electricity crackling]

598
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:50,540
Oh no, no, no.

599
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,141
You gotta be
fucking kidding!

600
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:55,378
Hello!!
Franco!!

601
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,783
Oh my God!
Are you serious?!

602
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,952
No, you couldn't wait 'til
tomorrow, could you?!

603
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:05,154
No, you couldn't wait!

604
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:08,892
[metallic thud,
creature noises]

605
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,565
Dana?

606
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:18,968
Dana?!

607
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,651
Oh my God!!

608
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,149
[murmur]

609
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,174
[murmurs continue]

610
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,816
Mike?

611
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,119
Stop playing games, man.

612
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:18,721
You and your friends
do your thing
and get outta here.

613
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,992
Kids.

614
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:28,297
Come on,
which one are you?

615
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,833
This has gotta be it.

616
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,343
[scurrying, snarling]

617
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,687
Oh, that thing is huge, dude!

618
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:51,788
I use it for boating.

619
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,624
Yeah, or to find UFO's.

620
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,332
Sorry I got you
stuck in here.

621
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:04,667
It's no problem, bro.

622
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:07,870
After we get out,
you can buy me
a beer or two....

623
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,806
Three or a case...

624
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:10,673
Two cases.

625
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,375
[chuckling]
Yeah.

626
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,716
I'm sorry I blew up
on you, too.

627
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,818
Nah, it's cool, man.
I was outta line.

628
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,087
No, it's not.

629
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,790
It's just...

630
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,161
It's crazy.

631
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,477
I still think...

632
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,746
When I'm at home...

633
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,719
That's she's gonna walk
through that door...

634
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:59,822
That big, beautiful smile.

635
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,527
Nothing wrong
with that, bro.

636
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,763
Yeah there is.

637
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,171
'Cause the truth is,
she's not.

638
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:29,051
[creature scurrying]

639
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,260
Kendra, will you hurry up?!

640
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:39,162
Will you slow down?!

641
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:40,830
This is such bullshit!

642
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:41,964
Bullshit.

643
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,766
Michael!

644
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,768
Floyd, will you
hold up a minute?!

645
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:46,836
Kendra,
I'm not fucking around!

646
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:48,004
I wanna get outta here,
all right?!

647
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:50,773
So do I, but where
are we rushing to?!

648
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:52,175
Mike,
what are you doing, man?

649
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,576
Why are you
walking so slow?!

650
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:55,511
Hurry up!

651
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,081
Are you sure this
is the right way out?!

652
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,951
Kendra, we just need
to keep moving forward,
all right?!

653
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:04,587
I know, but I don't wanna
be wandering in circles!

654
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,088
Well, neither do I!

655
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,523
So what do you think
we should do, huh?!

656
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:08,691
I don't know, okay?!

657
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,860
But you don't have
to yell at me!

658
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:11,761
I'm not yelling, all right?

659
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:14,030
We just need
to stay focused

660
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:17,600
and keep moving forward
because Mike is not helping
us at all--

661
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:19,302
Mike?

662
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,703
Mike!

663
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:23,105
Michael?

664
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:26,008
Mike, quit joking around!

665
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,043
Mike!

666
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:29,512
Mike, quit it, man!

667
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,549
Kendra!

668
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,854
[coughing]

669
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,122
Dude, what's that smell?

670
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:42,658
Smells like a sewer pipe
backed up.

671
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,393
You think we should
keep going this way?

672
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:45,294
We gotta keep trying.

673
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:47,496
There's no way
out behind us.

674
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:48,798
This place
is a fucking maze.

675
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,933
Every fucking door
is locked.

676
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,703
What the hell's that?

677
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,305
Kids doing graffiti
or something.

678
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:57,940
I don't know.

679
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,778
Lemme see
that phone again.

680
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,818
Hello?

681
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,620
Hello!

682
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,789
Fuck me!

683
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,826
Thing won't hold a signal.

684
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,896
Exit sign...

685
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,331
No fucking exits.

686
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,833
This can't be happening.

687
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,668
Would you relax?

688
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,670
All right, we're not stuck
on some deserted island.

689
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:29,005
We're in a building.

690
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,008
Every building
has a way out.

691
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,011
I hope you're right.

692
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,081
[squishing noise]

693
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,950
[dripping]

694
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,919
Uh, this is sewage!

695
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,288
What the fuck?!

696
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,355
Where did she come from?!

697
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:47,456
I don't know!

698
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,358
Is she dead?!

699
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,131
What are you doing?

700
00:48:55,133 --> 00:48:56,799
Relax!

701
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,977
She's barely breathing.

702
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,613
Fuck.

703
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:15,051
That sewage shit
is in her ear.

704
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,722
We gotta get the cart.

705
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,424
What?!
I'm not touching here!

706
00:49:21,426 --> 00:49:22,625
We can't leave her here!

707
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,127
What if that shit is toxic?!
Greg!

708
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,229
Look,
I'm fucking serious, man!

709
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,965
This fucking chick
fell from nowhere!

710
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:31,067
She's shaking,
she's covered in shit!

711
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:33,803
And I'm supposed to be
cool with that?!

712
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,442
You're not that
kinda guy, man.

713
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:41,377
Okay?

714
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,246
Go get the cart.

715
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:45,881
Fuck!

716
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,987

[creature gurgling]

718
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,670
I can't believe this.

719
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,006
I should be chillin'
drinking a cold one

720
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,875
and watching the game.

721
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,243
Let's try that door up there.

722
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:49,078
But no, I'm stuck
in the dark,

723
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,815
dragging some half-dead,
toxic chick.

724
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:54,383
You should be a
motivational speaker.

725
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:58,387
Yeah, I wish I could
motivate myself
into a bar right now.

726
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,390
[woman moaning]

727
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,261
She's waking up.

728
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:06,896
Great!

729
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,235
It's okay.

730
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,904
We're here to help you.

731
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,505
You're safe.

No.

733
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,777
Kill.

00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,913
Killed.

735
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,748
What did she say?

736
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,349
Shh, I can't hear her!

737
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,121
All killed.

738
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:34,023

00:51:38,963 --> 00:51:40,329
All killed.

742
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,432
All killed!!

743
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,300

00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,289
Shit!

I can't fucking believe this!

752
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:21,103
We gotta go after her.

753
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:22,805
Are you fucking insane?!

754
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,340
She just ragged out on us!

755
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,008
Greg, think about it, okay?

756
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,543
She's scared!

757
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,613
She's emotional!
Freaking out!

758
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,748
Somebody probably tried
to rape her or something!

759
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,751
Yeah, or more like she tried
to rape somebody!

760
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,089
T, let's get outta here,
okay?

761
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:43,192
Tell the cops.
Have them get her.

762
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,297
Why are we trying to play
Batman and Robin?

763
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,199
Please, tell me!

764
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:53,202
'Cause right now, I need
somebody to save me!

[Kendra]
Michael!

766
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,273
This is not the time to be
joking around, man!

767
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,008
This isn't funny!

768
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,877
Quit screwing around, man.
Let's go!

769
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:03,312
I just wanna go home!

774
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:17,293
Kendra, fuck this!
Let's just get out of here.

775
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:22,031
Where are you going?!
- I'm leaving!

776
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,232
Floyd, I know--

777
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:25,134
We're obviously stuck
in here until morning!

778
00:53:25,136 --> 00:53:27,536
I'm not staying here
'til morning!

779
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,071
If he wants to fuck around
in the dark,

780
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,573
he can fucking do that!

781
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:32,174
Floyd, I know you're pissed,

782
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:34,176
but we can't just leave him!

783
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:35,844
We're not leaving him
in here!

784
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:39,248
He's just playing some
fucking dumb, spook thrill!

785
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,250
That's what it is!

786
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:44,186
Michael, stop joking around!
Let's go!

787
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:47,389
Kendra, let's go!

788
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,093
We should go get him!

789
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,698
What are you doing?!
- Come on!!

790
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,200
I can walk, Floyd!

791
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:00,436
I said I can walk!
Let me go!

792
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,104
Let me go!

793
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:05,040
Fine, then stay in
here with him!

794
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:07,009
Don't fucking yell at me!

795
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:09,078
I'm tired,
and I wanna go home!

796
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,248
And I'm not freaking out
grabbing you!

797
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,217
Dammit,
where is my phone?!

798
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:18,287
I'm sorry, all right.
I just--

799
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:21,590
Mike, this isn't funny, man!!

800
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,799
Oh my God, Floyd!

801
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,034
What?

802
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,702
Look.

803
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,908
You've gotta
be fucking kidding me.

804
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,279
Do you think that
Mike drew that?

805
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:45,314
I don't know.

I'm gonna fucking
kill you, man!

810
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,357
These games
are fucking over!

811

Floyd...

812
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,130
There's another one.

Fuck this, let's go!

815

Bro, this chick is obviously
hiding from us.

816
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:20,249
We're never gonna find her.

817
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,353
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

818
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:25,754
What?!

819
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:29,658
Man, I don't feel like going
on some crazy chick hunt.

820
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,494
We'll double back
in 15 minutes...

821
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,762
and meet up right here.

822
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:37,199
Dude, let's find our way out.
Okay?

823
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:39,668
I'm tired.
I wanna leave.

824
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,706

You need some help?

838
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,820
Fuck.

839

I'll help you, but I swear to
God, if you jump out at me,

840
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:37,159
I will punch you in the face.

841
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:38,927
I am not afraid
to punch a chick.

842
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:41,730

Fuck!

847
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,118
Why did Mike draw those
things on the ground?!

848
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,553
I don't know!

849
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,388
Floyd, I'm scared,
what if somebody else--

850
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,590
Look, he's just

Remember the caves?!

Remember the caves?
That's all there is!

There's no one else here,

Then why are you
spooking yourself out?!

Feels good...

Feels good, don't it?!

900
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,613
Oh my God.

Feels good, don't it?!

902
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,627
Feels good, don't it?

903
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:02,230
Feels good, don't it?!

Help me!!

908
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:00,388
Oh shit...

909

It's okay.

910
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:06,995
It's okay.

911
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,465
I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

912
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,968
It's okay.

913
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,836
What's your name?

914
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,673
Shh.

915
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:21,242

[softly]
Rachel.

917
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,382
What?

918
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,919
Rachel.

919
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,892
You got locked in here, too?

920
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,664
It's okay, it's okay.
Shh...

921
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,871
There's something in here.

922
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,075
There's something
that's got my friend.

923
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,280
We'll find your friend.

924

[scurrying]

926
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,394
I don't wanna die!!

927
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:14,629
Stop!
- I don't wanna die!!

928
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,802
Let me go!
Let me go!

929
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,404
Stop!
- Let me go!

930
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,472
You gotta be quiet!

931
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,976
Shh, you gotta be quiet.

932
01:07:27,978 --> 01:07:31,179
Okay?
Okay?

933
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:34,315
Okay?
Shh.

934
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:37,085
Okay, that fucking thing
is in here.

935
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:41,022
And it's gonna kill us both
if you're not quiet.

936
01:07:41,024 --> 01:07:42,624
Okay?

937
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,796
We're gonna find
your friend, all right?

938
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,067
Let's go this way.

939
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,969
Michael, what is this?

940
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,337
Is this a joke?

941
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,239
You know I don't like
messing around
with voodoo,

942
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:05,473
and crap like this!

943
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,175
Kendra, you're really
that scared?

944
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:11,479
No, I just don't want to end
up on the front page
of the newspaper!

945
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,251
"The Demon Stones

01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,473
Michael?

954
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,410
Michael, say something!

955
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:53,314
Michael, please!

956
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,117
Don't worry, Kendra...

be just fine!

[creature noises]

962
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,782
All right...

963
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,683
Let's get her outta here.

964
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,289
Rachel...

965

This isn't an exit!
- We got nowhere
else to go!

973
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,575
You see it?
- No!

974
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,595
There's no way out.

975
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,398
I fucking hate this place!

976
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,166
What about up there?!

977

Look, there's a door!

Use a light!

983
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:31,245
What?!

984
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:34,749
It can't take the light!
