1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:01,035
-[Voiceover] In the
beginning, there was 1967.

2
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:10,144
Casual sex was born
and celebrated.

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:14,615
Men and women everywhere enjoyed

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,086
a new sense of sexual freedom.

5
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,221
But by the end of the 70s,

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,058
there was a terrible buzzkill

7
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:25,426
and the party was
over for everyone.

8
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:27,428
Then came the 80s,

9
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:30,531
and casual sex suffered further
under President Nancy Reagan.

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,069
-F'ing Canadian!

11
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,171
-[Voiceover] But
that too did pass,

12
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,472
and the 90s brought
forth another revolution,

13
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,075
casual sex under reprieve and
a new sense of acceptance.

14
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,579
During this time, Al Gore
invented the internet.

15
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,584
Electronic mail and
personal advertisements

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,554
were soon targeting an
unsuspecting public.

17
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,056
Millions began connecting
with others unknown

18
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,059
for the sole purpose of
instant personal gratification.

19
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:02,196
This modern marvel
soon turned wicked.

20
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,667
And spawned the
philandering creature,

21
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,404
the married man.

22
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,308
This is his story.

23
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,512
* The penis is the
loneliest of animals

24
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,699
* Wandering here and there

25
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,701
* Roaming around
from town to town

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,672
* Beneath a nest of hair

27
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,708
* You may think
his life's a breeze

28
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,212
* Easy and carefree

29
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,714
* But sometimes it gets very sad

30
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,285
* If it's not where it should be

31
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,388
* It should be in a vagina

32
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:04,124
* It should be in a vagina

33
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,728
* Life don't get
much funner yeah

34
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,732
* That's the way it is

35
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,536
-Hello?

36
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:22,676
I'm home.

37
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:24,745
Anybody?

38
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:26,347
Mom?

39
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:28,449
(speaks foreign language)

40
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,618
You promised!

41
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,152
(hushes)

42
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:33,321
(speaks foreign language)

43
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,156
Can you feel how
happy you make me?

44
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:47,735
-Ooh la la.

45
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:48,769
-I know where we can go.

46
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:50,704
(moans of pleasure)

47
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:58,246
(speaks foreign language)

48
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:00,448
I think my brother's watching
scrambled porn again.

49
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,786
(speaks foreign language)

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,987
Busted!

51
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,459
(screams)

52
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,493
Mom?

53
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:13,827
-You're home early!

54
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:15,529
-[Voiceover] This is Diane.

55
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:16,730
-Hello (laughs).

56
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,899
-[Voiceover] Married for
19 years, three kids,

57
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,501
all of them couldn't tell
you when it was her birthday.

58
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,271
Diane met Phil's three
requirements for casual sex,

59
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:29,277
human, alive, married.

60
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,479
-Which is pretty pathetic
when you consider

61
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:33,547
there's eight million
people in Naked City.

62
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,583
You'd think I could find
at least one married

63
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:37,718
woman who'd want to F word.

64
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,487
-[Woman] I need
to use the phone.

65
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,489
-Wait just a minute.

66
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:42,823
-Why can't you remember
to lock the front door?

67
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,459
-I left a set with
Gene in the car.

68
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:47,828
-What are you doing?

69
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,363
-Online.

70
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:50,831
-Playing web games again?

71
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:52,733
-No, shopping,

72
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,503
for your birthday.

73
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,472
-It's a little early
to be shopping for
my birthday isn't it?

74
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,307
-Well, Lordy Lordy,
here comes 40.

75
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,842
-[Woman] Don't remind me.

76
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:03,777
-Who do you need to
talk to so urgently?

77
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,648
-Look, I'm tired of
competing with you

78
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,418
when I need to use the phone.

79
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,986
-I'm working on
getting an upgrade.

80
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,387
-We must be the last
family still using dial up.

81
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,656
-You're the one that's
all about saving money.

82
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,291
-Then I surrender, Ok?

83
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:18,459
We need a better connection.

84
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:20,761
-How about a high speed fiber
optic cable for your birthday?

85
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:21,862
Wouldn't that be romantic?

86
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,331
-I'll make it easy for you.

87
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:24,598
All I want is a vacation.

88
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:25,866
-Is that all?

89
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:27,335
-Yeah, get off soon Ok?

90
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,769
(moans)

91
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:32,306
-Everyone has an excuse.

92
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,743
I do.

93
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:38,412
-[Voiceover] Phil
liked the applause.

94
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,748
-All right?

95
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:42,450
-[Voiceover] Phil
liked saying yes.

96
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,786
-[Phil] Of course you
deserve a loan without

97
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,587
any verifiable income.

98
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,288
-[Voiceover] Phil
liked being appreciated

99
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:49,890
for doing what Phil
was expected to do,

100
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,428
day after day, week after week.

101
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,566
-Sorry but you're much
to responsible for
a loan modification.

102
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,670
-[Voiceover] Year after year,

103
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,572
being the hero,

104
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:05,839
-Need a jump?

105
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,341
-[Voiceover] Phil was
happy with his row.

106
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,377
For Phil, it was a fair
trade for true love and

107
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,647
happy penis.

108
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,549
-Absolutely!

109
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:15,649
-[Voiceover] Then at some
point the applause lessened,

110
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,588
appreciation waned.

111
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:22,923
But Phil was fine with this
life of quiet desperation.

112
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,527
As long as Phil
was getting laid.

113
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,399
-[Doctor] Please,
please, have a seat.

114
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:35,536
(unclear) for the pleasure.

115
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:41,742
-What did you say?

116
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:42,943
-Easy now, just relax.

117
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:50,518
-[Phil] I think I'm
gonna get a (mumbles).

118
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,554
-You 42?

119
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:54,655
-37.

120
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:56,757
-I think you are a
little young to be in

121
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:08,902
for a prostate exam, aren't you?

122
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:10,771
-Well, I thought
it'd be a good idea.

123
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:12,973
-How long have you been married?

124
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:17,978
-[Phil] 12 years.

125
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:19,613
-Long time.

126
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:23,617
Do you have regular intercourse?

127
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:26,987
-Almost always, so boring.

128
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,524
-That's not what I meant.

129
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:35,463
-I try to get backdoor,
she always says no.

130
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,000
I know why now.

131
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,535
Are we almost done?

132
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:43,771
-Oh course, yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,939
Yep!

134
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:48,809
Do you have regular ejaculation,

135
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,480
like daily, weekly, monthly?

136
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:54,615
-Why are you asking me this?

137
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,750
-Because see your
urine sample test

138
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,821
always indicates excessive
amounts of seminal fluids.

139
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:04,692
-[Phil] What does that mean?

140
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,561
-It's not healthy.

141
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:07,661
See, your body constantly
manufacturers sperm.

142
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,764
And when you don't
ejaculate regularly

143
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:12,833
semens is absorbed
back into the body.

144
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,037
This creates stress
on the testes,

145
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,040
which in turns
harms your prostate.

146
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,477
-English?

147
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:25,012
-Blue balls kill Phil.

148
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,050
Call me for a follow up.

149
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:32,720
-[Phil] Come on honey,
doctor's orders.

150
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,493
-[Woman] I would prefer not to.

151
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:41,729
-If I don't get a blowzoe joe,

152
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,934
I could get prostate
cancer and die.

153
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,068
-Prostate cancer?

154
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:49,770
You're pathetic.

155
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:51,605
-It almost killed
America's favorite mayor.

156
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,906
It wasn't 9/11, you know.

157
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,575
-Go jerk instead of
blowzoe joe, I'm tired.

158
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,011
-I love you.

159
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,047
-Good, then you understand.

160
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,083
-[Voiceover] One day, Phil
realized he's made love

161
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,492
more times to himself this year
than he had with his spouse.

162
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,096
-You can't turn your
wife on, who can you?

163
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,772
-I can't go to sleep
because my penis

164
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,952
is harder than Chinese calculus.

165
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:39,720
-Age, sex, location?

166
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,055
-37 and married
but not dead here.

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,726
-Who's on the down low?

168
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,126
-Don't let your small
phallus ruin your sex life.

169
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,563
-Barely legal student
needs hot release.

170
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,767
-Wanna go primate?

171
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:54,534
-Wicked, wicked--

172
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,136
-Having a huge lovestick is easy

173
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,538
with a miracle herbal solution.

174
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:00,073
-Isn't this room for
married people only?

175
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,142
-Freaks in the doctor.

176
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:03,944
-That means you, and you.

177
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:05,979
-Where are the cyber windows?

178
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,948
-Hey stud!

179
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,683
-Wrong, wrong!

180
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:10,350
-Sexy slut with big yam
yams wants to drain you dry.

181
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:15,155
-Sounds inviting, wanna cyber?

182
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,791
-You bet hun, just
cum to my website.

183
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,162
$39.99 per month gets you easy--

184
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,998
-Burn in hell!

185
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,166
-How about a lube job?

186
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,174
-You're nuts!

187
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:35,909
-[Voiceover] Gene and
Phil each married about

188
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:37,945
the same time in
their early 20s.

189
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,180
But whereas Phil
volunteered for the war,

190
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,186
Gene was drafted.

191
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,188
-Isn't your wife turning 40?

192
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,923
I mean all the
checkout magazines says

193
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:51,458
she should be
getting her freak on.

194
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:52,425
-Yeah well at this
stage of my marriage,

195
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:54,928
being married is
like being in prison.

196
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,831
-No it's not amigo.

197
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:00,200
-Oh yeah, there's more
sex happening in prison.

198
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,971
-You and Evelyn Ok?

199
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:06,907
-Well, we're good cellmates.

200
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:08,776
-I know what you're
thinking, don't do it.

201
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,713
You can't lie.

202
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:14,882
-I can lie.

203
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:16,616
-Yeah, what's the biggest
lie you ever told?

204
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,218
-I do.

205
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,754
-If you start telling yourself
there's ways outside of

206
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,823
your marriage to find
happiness then you're done.

207
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,158
You wouldn't like it if
she was doing it to you.

208
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,227
-Wow, I totally
lost my erection.

209
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,898
-Good, 'cause there's nothing
better than having someone

210
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,235
to love you unconditionally
for the dog you are.

211
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,670
-Don't play moral
superiority with me,

212
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,840
you've been there too.

213
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:40,874
-Yeah and I pray to God I never

214
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:42,676
make stupid like that again.

215
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,111
-Plus, there's dog in all men.

216
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,715
You know who gives
birth to dogs?

217
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,249
Bitches.

218
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,084
-You're not listening.

219
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:52,252
-What should I do?

220
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:54,822
Buy more lotion for
my hand callouses?

221
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,090
-You find a way to make
her want to show up

222
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:58,792
and play ball with you.

223
00:10:59,259 --> 00:10:59,960
-Like how?

224
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:01,294
-I don't know,
flowers, massage toys,

225
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:06,666
some sort of romantic bullshit.

226
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,268
-I'm already married,

227
00:11:10,738 --> 00:11:10,771
why should I have to
keep doing that stuff?

228
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,073
-'Cause if you're lucky,

229
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:16,009
'til death do you
part's a long ways off.

230
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,145
-Why wasn't the
front door locked?

231
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,758
-Sorry, I forgot.

232
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,225
-You forgot?

233
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:33,293
Where's Benjamin?

234
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:34,294
-Babysitter.

235
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:35,228
-Why?

236
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:36,329
-I really need to tell you?

237
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:37,697
-Yes.

238
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:38,899
-Well, because I want
to seduce my wife

239
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,836
and touch her inappropriately.

240
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,872
-Well she's married.

241
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,006
-Then it's a sure thing.

242
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:47,307
-Come on baby, giddy up.

243
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:55,148
-Where's the towel?

244
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:24,845
-You need one?

245
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,046
-Didn't you cum?

246
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,049
-I had an orgasm.

247
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:30,350
-There's nothing there.

248
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:35,989
-You don't have to ejaculate

249
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:37,357
in order to have an orgasm.

250
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,792
-You faked your orgasm?

251
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:41,361
-They're two separate
things Evelyn.

252
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:43,831
It's a biological fact.

253
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:44,998
-I don't believe this.

254
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,134
-I had fun, didn't you?

255
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,369
-You know what?

256
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,904
Never mind.

257
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:54,107
-Why do I get the feeling
you'd rather be reading a book?

258
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,078
-It's only because of
you sex is the most

259
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,080
important thing in the world.

260
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:01,381
It's not with me.

261
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,183
-Tell me why.

262
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,387
-It's called life, Phil.

263
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,122
People change, we
evolve, get grey hairs.

264
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,924
Tits sag, balls
droop, what the F?

265
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,126
This is a surprise to you?

266
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:14,794
-So I'm the odd one here?

267
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,030
-You think I'm strange?

268
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:18,798
-No, I just want to know why

269
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:21,368
you don't find me
attractive anymore?

270
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:22,903
-Here's a secret, shh,
don't tell anyone Ok?

271
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,107
Are you ready?

272
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:29,409
You are attractive to me.

273
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:31,444
-Then why is our marital
sex life such a train wreck?

274
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,916
-I didn't say it's not.

275
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,018
It's rather ordinary,

276
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:40,988
what we're working through
is nothing special.

277
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,122
-So that's the way it has to be?

278
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,257
For better or for worse?

279
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:47,160
-Easy with the daddy drama,
you don't have it so bad.

280
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,430
People living in other
parts of the world,

281
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:52,265
you have bigger
things to worry about.

282
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,167
-I don't care about that.

283
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:55,468
I only care about what's
happening in my world.

284
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,406
You know, what's
happening right now

285
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:01,441
and why you're not in it.

286
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,043
-God, give me a
break you ass hat!

287
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,979
I'm the mother of your child.

288
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:07,447
-Well don't blame this on Benji.

289
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:09,983
I'm not just another
chore (unclear) mom.

290
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:12,452
-Just stop, stop
pushing my buttons.

291
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,189
It's not attractive!

292
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,125
-Ok.

293
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:21,094
Maybe we should see
another marriage counselor.

294
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,998
-Again?

295
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,035
Good luck finding one
that's not divorced.

296
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:28,335
-Don't you think we should
talk to somebody, anybody?

297
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:31,204
-How is someone that we don't
know gonna help our marriage?

298
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,008
-Yeah but maybe a stranger
is exactly what we need

299
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,147
to figure things out.

300
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:41,481
Oh boy!

301
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:46,253
* Rewind the clock

302
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:02,502
* Tick tock erase
the shock of our gang

303
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,207
* Change all the names

304
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:08,775
* Shift the blame

305
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:10,410
* I'm not the same girl you knew

306
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,913
* I'm over you all over you

307
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,518
* We were so blind some times

308
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,967
* Forward crying for romance

309
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,304
* No second chance at this dance

310
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,440
* Our circumstance was the clue

311
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,977
* I'm over you all over you

312
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:48,315
* But the joke is on me

313
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,557
* And it hurts when I laugh

314
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,428
* Defense is all gone

315
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,464
* And there's no
second half to regret *

316
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:09,569
-Greetings, I'm a
college graduate.

317
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:28,521
I'm unemployed, racked
with debt, but hey

318
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,391
I can do pushups with my tongue.

319
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,126
-When I think of
my special someone,

320
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:34,594
I think of you,

321
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,063
in handcuffs,

322
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,197
gagged,

323
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:38,398
with a butt plug in your ass!

324
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,033
-What do I like most in a woman?

325
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,002
Without a doubt, my dick!

326
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:44,604
(speaks foreign language)

327
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,143
-My man must be willing
to urinate sitting down,

328
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,147
fold towels into thirds and
prefer two percent milk.

329
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,551
-I will be your master,
you will worship me

330
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,557
and beg for forgiveness.

331
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,292
But there will be only pain!

332
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,561
-Internet personal ads
are nothing but pleas

333
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,399
of desperation from lazy people.

334
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,501
-But I found this
website Love a la Carte,

335
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,636
it's a fancy clearinghouse
for people stuck in

336
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,639
relationship quagmires.

337
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:21,308
-Yeah and it's not for
you because, I don't know,

338
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,644
because you're already married?

339
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:26,613
-Don't throw away the car
just 'cause the muffler's bad.

340
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,648
-No, I don't.

341
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:30,450
But I also didn't make a
vow to a 63 Dart either.

342
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,221
-So by commensurating
with other married women

343
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,056
through internet personals,

344
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:38,658
you know you're married,
they're married,

345
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,460
and the rules are clear.

346
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:42,429
-What rules?

347
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,496
-Family first.

348
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:45,265
-Yeah, what's second?

349
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:46,666
-Everything else.

350
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:48,268
-Are you gonna write the ad?

351
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:50,670
-Why not it seems like
a little anonymous

352
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,672
harmless fun to me?

353
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:54,341
A little easier now, you
did it once upon a time.

354
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,576
You want in?

355
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:58,378
-No, I like having
sex with one person.

356
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,314
I'm sentimental that way.

357
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,217
-Hold on, it's not just
about getting laid.

358
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,418
If I wanted to buy a
whore, I'd do that today.

359
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,687
-Yeah, for now all
you can afford is me.

360
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:10,623
-I just want to know what I
can do to be desirable again.

361
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,627
What I can do to be appreciated?

362
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,096
What can I do to get
a little applause?

363
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:19,399
-What if Evelyn was
doing the same thing,

364
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,370
looking for a Sancho?

365
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,339
-What if my ding dong
grew six inches, Gene?

366
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,307
-Aren't you a little
worried about the husbands

367
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,777
of these online wives?

368
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,544
-No, the husbands are
more worried about why

369
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:33,380
their wives are
cheating on them,

370
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,114
than who they're
cheating on them with.

371
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:36,516
-You tool.

372
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:39,519
You're going to hell.

373
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:41,654
-Yep and I'm taking over, drive!

374
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,526
Come on, this is
gonna be worth it.

375
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:50,630
Countless babes on the
internet just couldn't wait

376
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,432
to get (mumbles).

377
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:53,566
(screams)

378
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,603
(grunts)

379
00:18:59,506 --> 00:18:59,539
-[Voiceover] Phil's quest
wasn't for any female

380
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,743
but a married one, therefore,

381
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,446
he must think smarter
than a single man.

382
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:08,748
-A married man shouldn't search
for dates online at home.

383
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,684
That's why you have
the internet at work.

384
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,553
-[Voiceover] Phil
knew most husbands

385
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:16,756
were easily replaced
by science and plastic.

386
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,427
But with the internet,

387
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:25,665
a married man can learn a
lot about how to succeed,

388
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,235
in the tryst trade.

389
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,971
So Phil visualized the prize

390
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,306
and created a road
map to getting there.

391
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,342
-How can something
so impersonal,

392
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:37,210
salvage a personal dilemma?

393
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,379
-[Voiceover] Phil
new most men failed

394
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,383
because they sold themselves
from their perspective

395
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,286
and not a woman's.

396
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,154
Phil would not make
the same mistake.

397
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,791
-Let's be honest,

398
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:53,593
you and I both have long
term commitments elsewhere.

399
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,463
We realize that our time
on this planet is fleeting.

400
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,732
Like you, passion with that
person has hit rock bottom.

401
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,804
Yet, you're not willing to
roll over and play dead either.

402
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,343
That is why I'm hoping
another married woman

403
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,746
will consider
responding to my ad.

404
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,649
To her I'd say this,

405
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:18,718
"You and I are a rare breed.

406
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:21,821
"A small target market in
a very complicated game.

407
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,825
"But if you're willing
to take a chance

408
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,730
"at how to play that game right,

409
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:31,398
"I'm willing to
discuss it with you,

410
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,233
"at lunch."

411
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:36,769
Now your first thought may
be to quickly turn away.

412
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,841
But maybe tomorrow

413
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:45,712
or the next day

414
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:48,881
you'll reconsider that long
neglected desire within.

415
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,720
Yes, yes you can have it all.

416
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,858
Your public moments elsewhere,

417
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,263
your private moments

418
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,369
with me.

419
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:14,907
See I don't wanna get
to the end of the line

420
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,909
and wonder if I missed
a chance for magic

421
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,545
while I can still pull it off.

422
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:19,879
For us it may be that
it goes no further

423
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,816
than that lunch date.

424
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:24,884
But what a thrill,

425
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:28,655
what a thrill it
would be to think

426
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:31,791
it almost did.

427
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:34,894
(cheers)

428
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,367
Old Mother Hubbard

429
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:46,573
-Old Mother Hubbard

430
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:46,806
-went to the cupboard

431
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:48,675
-went to the cupboard

432
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:48,908
-to fetch the poor dog a bone

433
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:50,810
-(mumbles) poor dog a bone.

434
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:53,880
-Your vibrator.

435
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:55,948
-[Voiceover] Greeting from
Love a la Carte your ad was

436
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,920
declined, you have
zero messages.

437
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,557
You are rejected!

438
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,325
-[Child] Daddy?

439
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:07,927
-and when she came there
the cupboard was bare.

440
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:10,730
-And so the poor dog had none.

441
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,366
-How's life in the internet
fast lane, any luck?

442
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,772
-It's early.

443
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:21,608
-What, no replies?

444
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,943
Poor baby.

445
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:26,946
I guess it's confirmed
then, you suck.

446
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,650
-Just fix my car so I don't
have to see you again, Ok?

447
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,353
-(laughs) You put so much work
into creating that fantasy,

448
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,857
maybe you should apply some of
that knowledge on your wife.

449
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:42,462
-You know what,

450
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:42,595
maybe you should lick a
dog's ass until it bleeds.

451
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:43,730
-(laughs) Yeah, call me foolish

452
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,366
but risking so much just
to have sex with someone

453
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,503
who means absolutely nothing

454
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,571
is asinine.

455
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,773
-You're right.

456
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:55,775
-What?

457
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:58,645
-You heard me,
don't bust my balls.

458
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,747
-Of course I'm right.

459
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:02,949
And you're wrong, no matter
what's going on in your marriage

460
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:05,752
you have the responsibility
to create opportunities

461
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,622
to deal with problems
and fix them.

462
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:10,990
-Yeah, well your point is moot

463
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:13,660
if you're the only one
who thinks it's a problem.

464
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:14,827
Apparently, this
is my own dilemma.

465
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:17,530
-All right, here's what you do.

466
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:19,699
You find a massage parlor
that's giving happy endings

467
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,469
and while you're there,

468
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,571
have them pluck that wild
hair out of your ass.

469
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:25,805
-This isn't just about the sex.

470
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:30,009
-Then it's worse than I thought.

471
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:33,813
-This marriage of mine,
it's way underwater.

472
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,685
My wife, she's a fish

473
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:39,952
and I'm drowning.

474
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:41,621
Where's my bailout?

475
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:43,022
-Shide for it, Phil.

476
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:44,624
-I want my bailout.

477
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:46,526
-You know,

478
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:50,730
there is more than one
woman out there for you

479
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,933
but trust me

480
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:56,068
you don't want to
meet 'em, not now.

481
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,939
Not ever.

482
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:01,874
-Well, if Love a la
Carte can't help me,

483
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:03,676
there's always alcoholism.

484
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:05,444
-Yeah but what you wanna
justify is living a lie,

485
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,047
it's cheating.

486
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:09,682
-As long as it's
not a lie to myself,

487
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:11,684
I don't see the problem.

488
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,519
-I'm sorry to hear that.

489
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:17,890
I wish there was something I
could say to change your mind.

490
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,527
Or your wife's.

491
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:23,062
-Thanks but don't blame Evelyn.

492
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:25,998
It's not her fault
she closed with me.

493
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,067
-Such a mad existence.

494
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:31,738
Living in the shadows,

495
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,073
the darkness is gonna come,

496
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:37,076
so will the hurt.

497
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:40,613
-Yeah, well at least
I don't have company.

498
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:42,849
* I'm sick of here alone

499
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,859
-You look like the kind of
man that could use a woman.

500
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,028
Am I right?

501
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,630
Am I?

502
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:58,831
-Yeah man, I'm really Jonesing.

503
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,570
-What would it take

504
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,151
for me to put you
inside of a woman today?

505
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:19,986
-I don't know, what do you got?

506
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:23,890
-I got it all son.

507
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:26,392
Freaks in heat, Pollys
wanting crackers,

508
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,095
what you need baby?

509
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:30,763
-Something discreet.

510
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,132
-Discreet?

511
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,102
-Yeah.

512
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:36,168
-Discreet like, "I'm
legal in 34 states" or

513
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:39,839
discreet like, "This
don't make me homo right?"

514
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,075
(laughs)

515
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,044
-No, discreet like
she's married.

516
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:46,646
-A married woman?

517
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:52,151
Why?

518
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:59,325
-Because I'm married.

519
00:25:59,358 --> 00:25:59,926
-Oh sir, you sicken me.

520
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:05,564
Have you no regard for
the sanctity of marriage?

521
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,669
You made a promise to your wife,

522
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:13,172
to be faithful, to be honest,
to cherish your relationship.

523
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,878
You said, "I do."

524
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,080
You accepted the wedding gifts.

525
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,350
You made a commitment to your
woman before God Almighty,

526
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,586
'til death do you part.

527
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:29,889
Well hallelujah!

528
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:33,125
Are you ready to die?

529
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:36,128
Answer me, are you ready
to die today motherfucka?

530
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,931
-I'm dead already.

531
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:46,205
-And the phoenix
shall rise again.

532
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:00,853
-Go home Phil it's
three o'clock!

533

ask you about me?

it's just some man I hooked
up with on the internet.

-I never got as many
dates with my ad

-Yeah but don't
tell anybody, Ok?

656

we had our first kiss.

-[Phil] I don't want you to go.

-[Blonde] Phil, I have to
pick up my son from school.

668

And you have to
get back to work.

669
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:28,667
-I'd rather be working on this.

670
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:31,670
-Phil, you're making me dizzy.

-[Blonde] Phil, please.

after so much time of
putting up with your husband,

677
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:47,353
when did you decide
to sub plan him?

678
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:48,687
-Sub plan him?

679
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:50,289
-Wow, now that's a
nice parking spot.

680
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:00,599
We should have parked, damn!

681
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,206
-I'm not subplanning my husband!

682
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,311
I think you mean to
ask me, "Why do this?"

683
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,615
Why would anyone do this?

684
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,385
-I feel like Moses.

685
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:22,388
-Moses?

686
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,256
-Yeah.

687
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:26,558
I mean he wandered around
the desert for years.

688
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,328
It was hot, he was
probably thirsty,

689
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,564
Of course he was Jewish.

690
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:34,933
I mean, I'm not Jewish but

691
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,467
I'm circumcised.

692
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:36,635
But don't ask me why.

693
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:38,570
-Moses?

694
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,641
-You and I,

695
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:45,677
it's like we're
lost in a desert.

696
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:47,746
I say we make it rain.

697
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,520
-You've really
thought about this.

698
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:56,755
-Yes, I have.

699
00:35:59,258 --> 00:35:59,291
-My best answer is I'm bored
as fuck with pedestrian penis.

700
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,762
-That's a good answer.

701
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:10,302
Angela.

702

* Small talk is cheap with
the friends that I keep

* I spread a little
stories around

707
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,228
* I gotta get out of this town

708
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,465
* Feeling like an
old hand me down

709
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,201
* Paid all my dues now
I'm left with the blues

710
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,805
* And lately all
I wear is a frown

711

* I've been around
for a year and a day *

00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,812
-Well, hello stranger.

713
00:36:58,817 --> 00:36:58,850
-I think your husband
might need these.

714
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:01,753
-You came all the way across
town just to drop off keys?

715
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:04,756
-Nah, I had other
business in the ghetto.

716
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:06,825
-Yeah, what kind of business?

717
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:08,494
-None-ya business.

718
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:10,662
-None-ya business!

719
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:12,498
You're a better mechanic
than you are a comedian.

720
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,566
* Desire is lost

721
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:16,835
* And isn't anywhere to be found

722
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,838
* Gotta get out of this town

723
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,409
* I'm getting tired
of running around

724
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,478
-So I hear your big
birthday is coming.

725
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:27,846
-[Evelyn] Don't remind me.

726
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:29,848
-What's that term?

727
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:32,484
What do they call
women in their 40s?

728
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:32,851
-A MILF?

729
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,488
-Yeah, well we both
know that's not true.

730
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:39,358
-Yeah, maybe for your wife.

731
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,859
(laughter)

732
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,829
-A cougar, that's it.

733
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:44,396
Yeah, you'll be a cougar.

734
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:46,298
-I hate those trendy
demeaning terms

735
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,868
they come up with for women.

736
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:50,536
-I thought it was a compliment.

737
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:52,871
-That's because you're a man.

738
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:54,873
-Ooh, kitty likes to scratch.

739
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,309
-Really I just rather everyone

740
00:37:58,944 --> 00:37:59,878
forget about my birthday.

741
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:02,481
I bet Phil's planning
something special.

742
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,385
-You'd lose that bet.

743
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:09,421
-You know he talks
about you a lot.

744
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,560
I mean it's obvious, he really
wants you two to be happy.

745
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,696
-He could have fooled me.

746
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:19,865
-Well, that's just because

747
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:23,569
it requires major energy
and focus for some men to

748
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:26,472
show even the simplest,
loving gestures.

749
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,741
-And yet for some it's so easy.

750
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,581
-Yeah but,

751
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:36,915
Phil's your man now.

752
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:38,917
And well when you show him you

753
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,920
appreciate what he does for ya',

754
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:43,855
it makes him feel like he's won.

755
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:45,557
-So now, we're keeping score?

756
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:47,459
He has to feel like he's won

757
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:48,927
in order to be happy?

758
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:50,529
-All the time.

759
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:51,930
He won you.

760
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:53,699
-He won the booby prize

761
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:55,434
and it turns out,

762
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:56,602
I got second place.

763
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:58,604
What about life on my terms?

764
00:38:58,637 --> 00:38:59,471
-These are the terms.

765
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:01,940
You are damsel in distress.

766
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:04,342
And he's the hero rescuing you.

767
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:06,945
-Well maybe I
prefer the bad guy.

768
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,348
-I know it hurts.

769
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:13,852
But

770
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:17,523
what's happened in
your marriage is past.

771
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:18,890
You can still be happy
with Phil again, you just

772
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,960
you need to remember,

773
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:23,429
what all you have together.

774
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,431
-Is that what you tell yourself?

775
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,967
-Everyday Evelyn.

776
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:34,773
Everyday.

777
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:37,876
-[Phil] Did you like college?

778
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:48,420
-Yes, it was fun, I used
to dance, do you dance?

779
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,389
-Evelyn and I haven't
been dancing since

780
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:53,992
God, since the
Christmas work party.

781
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:56,962
-Christmas how intolerant.

782
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:58,530
Don't you mean holiday party?

783
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,499
-Forgive me, infidels.

784
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:02,701
Happy Hanukkah, Happy Kwanzaa
-What are you, sit down!

785
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,003
[Phil] Happy Ramadan!
-What are you doing?

786
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:06,672
What about being discreet?

787
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:07,939
-I'm sorry, I just
feel so alive!

788
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:09,675
-Oh my God, my (mumbles).

789
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:14,012
-It's your fault.

790
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:15,947
-My fault?!

791
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:17,583
-Yes, you turn me on,
I feel so powerful.

792
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:19,618
-Come on you're a married man--

793
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:21,887
-I hold my power.

794
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:23,021
Behold my power.

795
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:25,557
-[Blonde] Where is
your off switch?

796
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:26,758
-[Phil] Behold it.

797
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:27,993
-My, you're a
handful aren't you?

798
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,630
-There's a man crossing central

799
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:33,031
and you're holding my penis.

800
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:35,033
-We shouldn't, I mean
we could get caught.

801
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,604
-It's a couple ordering escargot

802
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:40,038
and you're holding my penis.

803
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,674
-I can see my bridge
room from here.

804
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,044
-And you're holding my penis.

805
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:47,613
-I want you so bad.

806
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:57,823
-You're turning me into
somebody I don't even recognize!

807
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,691
-Don't mess up this (unclear).

808
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:00,559
-Ok.

809
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:01,059
(screams)

810
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:03,061
-You didn't plan this very well.

811
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:06,765
-I'll get us a room.

812
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:07,933
-There's no vacancy,
I already checked!

813
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,769
-Serendipity at last!

814
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:17,008
-The penthouse suite.

815
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,910
(thunder roars)

816
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:27,753
-It's been raining.

817
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:38,597
-That is most certainly correct.

818
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:46,104
-You know those black
shoe laces you got me

819
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:55,046
to replace the
ones I already had?

820
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:56,915
They're too short.

821
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:58,917
-That's a shame.

822
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:06,758
I'll take them back.

823
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:07,859
-Too late.

824
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:15,667
-I suppose it is.

825
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:21,807
-I'm just being realistic
about our situation.

826
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:30,616
I realize at any given
moment it can all end,

827
00:42:31,817 --> 00:42:33,151
no strings attached.

828
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:34,853
-You're afraid of me, why?

829
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:37,889
-Think about how we met?

830
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:39,958
Why we keep seeing each other?

831
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,360
Sooner or later with
that kind of intimacy,

832
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,561
we're bound to have feelings.

833
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,963
I just don't want to see
either one of us get hurt.

834
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:47,165
-Men, you're all a
bunch of pussies!

835
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:50,969
-How did you meet your husband?

836
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:54,840
-[Angela] At work,
back in college.

837
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,176
Remember I told
you I was a dancer?

838
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:00,178
-Right, so nightclub,
bartending?

839
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:03,649
-No, not like that.

840
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:06,051
He was in the front office
of the pro football team.

841
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:08,987
I was on the dance
squad for five years.

842
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:11,723
-You were a professional
cheerleader?

843
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:14,626
-I was even in the Superbowl.

844
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:16,862
My parents said they saw
a close up of me on the TV

845
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,198
and right before the credit
card graphics rolled,

846
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,701
it covered my face.

847
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:23,869
We lost.

848
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:26,638
-Oh God!

849
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:27,773
I've hit the mother-load!

850
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:29,708
-You can keep that.

851
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:32,744
I was gonna give you the
calendar but it's not even good

852
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,014
for another four years.

853
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:37,615
Phil?

854
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:41,920
Surprise!

855
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:29,868
Happy Birthday!

856
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:31,136
-I'm still 39 for
two more weeks.

857
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,671
-That's a surprise.

858
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:34,873
-Plane tickets to my sister's.

859
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,677
-Drink all the boxes
of wine you want.

860
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:41,947
Sit in her hot tub
until you prune.

861
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:43,681
-Why did you get
me plane tickets?

862
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,216
-(internal voice) 'Cause I'm
trying to get rid of you.

863
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:46,251
You said you wanted a vacation.

864
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:47,886
Why spend all of it driving?

865
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:49,287
-I don't know.

866
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:51,823
What about all that security
screen now, it's brutal.

867
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:53,992
-It's not brutal, it's smart.

868
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:56,828
And if it was me going,

869
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:58,163
I'd ask them, how much
for extra groping?

870
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:00,031
-Why aren't you in with us?

871
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,300
-You know I can't stand

872
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,203
being around your crazy sister
for more than a weekend.

873
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,304
Plus, I've got to work.

874
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:07,939
-Doesn't seem right though,

875
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:10,241
living our lives
in parts like this.

876
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:11,877
We should be together.

877
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:13,544
-What do you call 12
years of marriage?

878
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,981
-We should want to be
together not because we have

879
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,984
a kid or a dog.

880
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:20,718
-Look, I miss ya' already.

881
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:24,923
I just thought you
might like to get away

882
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:28,994
from everything that's
going on around here.

883
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:30,728
Including me.

884
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:31,997
-Would you miss me if I was gone

885
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:34,265
forever?

886
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:35,533
-Wait a minute!

887
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:38,904
How did we go from happy
birthday to this inquisition?

888
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:39,270
-I was checking out
this woman's website,

889
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:41,940
some of the bloggers
had some ideas about

890
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,876
what keeps a relationship fresh.

891
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,077
-You've been online?

892
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,815
-Of course, isn't everybody?

893
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,352
-That makes two of
us if I ejaculate.

894
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:06,231
-Hey, you're gonna have a lot
of free time on your hands

895
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,100
while I'm gone, are you
gonna be a good boy?

896
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:11,169
-Of course, what
else would I do?

897
00:46:12,037 --> 00:46:13,271
I'm a married man.

898
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:14,305
-What are you doing?

899
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:22,413
-Marking my territory.

900
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,150
Give me that!

901
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:27,418
-Everyone must
evacuate the building.

902
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:33,024
Go to staircase Z,
(foreign language).

903
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,793
-What the hell was that?

904
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:39,597
-Rebel Rousers in the perimeter.

905
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,199
Rebel Rousers in the perimeter!

906
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:41,933
-Rebel Rousers?

907
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:42,868
-Oh snap!

908
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:43,969
-Can you see
anything down there?

909
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:47,839
-Only martyrdom and glory, Phil!

910
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,408
Glory, hallelujah.

911
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,177
-Was that a Mountie?

912
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:53,879
Where is staircase Z?

913
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,380
What the hell is a Rebel Rouser?

914
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,082
-(unclear) reform now man!

915
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,817
-[Mountie] You there--

916
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:00,651
-Hey, hey, don't tase me bro'!

917
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:01,920
(screams)

918
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,022
-He pissing in his pants,
he pissing himself.

919
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,357
Go Canada!

920
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:08,059
-Anarchy at last.

921
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,261
-I'm gonna need a new intern.

922
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:12,430
All these single people.

923
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:20,939
And I thought
everyone was married.

924
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:22,440
-One hundred unmarried women

925
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:24,842
for every 86 unmarried men.

926
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:27,078
-Lucky for those
guys that are gay.

927
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:29,881
-Yeah, and they want
to be married too.

928
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:32,984
-What's the point in being gay
if you're gonna be married?

929
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,120
You just wasted the best
part of being a homo.

930
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,289
-Yeah, you're right.

931
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:40,258
Why should gays be allowed
to sully the sanctity of a

932
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:42,460
breeders only
marriage institution?

933
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,230
-You get to be
promiscuous by default.

934
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:47,265
You've been given a
pass, nobody cares.

935
00:47:49,134 --> 00:47:50,401
-Are you jealous?

936
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,137
Or curious?

937
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:54,039
-You try being like
that as a married man,

938
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,373
you're branded a piranha.

939
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:57,042
-I know one good thing about
being married and faithful,

940
00:47:58,276 --> 00:47:59,410
I'd sleep like a
monkey flying baby.

941
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:01,879
-But Gene, all this power
at your finger tips?

942
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,483
You don't like what
you got, wait a day.

943
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:08,153
They'll be a hundred new
ads for you to consider.

944
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,288
You can always trade up.

945
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,190
-You're never gonna be satisfied

946
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:14,025
if you're always looking
for the next best thing.

947
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,293
-I don't see it that way.

948
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:16,427
I see dreams coming true.

949
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,497
Fantasies fulfilled,

950
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:21,232
wishes granted.

951
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,268
I can be of service

952
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:27,973
to all these unwashed,

953
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:30,041
single masses.

954
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:31,509
-Of service?

955
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:34,512
-Who am I to deny
these women me?

956
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,249
-You're smoking now?

957
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,119
-I don't inhale.

958
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:43,521
-You're not a martyr, Phil.

959
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,124
You need to get off this
power trip that you're on.

960
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,226
-But Gene,

961
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,063
this kind of power
makes it your world,

962
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,499
not God's.

963
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:56,234
-You're only this confident
because you already

964
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:57,302
got what you really want.

965
00:48:58,403 --> 00:48:58,536
-Sex equity buddy,
that's what I got.

966
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,206
-Yeah, if you were single,

967
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:05,076
you wouldn't be so
sure of yourself.

968
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:06,544
LMFAO, I've been to Superbowl,

969
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,549
I know what I talk about?

970
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:13,284
What?

971
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:14,485
-All your bases
are belong to us.

972
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,087
-Phil!

973
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:17,488
-Don't talk to me in all caps

974
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:18,689
because you don't have the
balls to do what I'm doing.

975
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:20,358
You know guys like you,

976
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:25,463
they tell their wives to
put the toilet seat down.

977
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:26,531
-Your car is finished.

978
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:33,238
So are we!

979
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:34,972
-I know you.

980
00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:47,118
I know what you want.

981
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:51,022
You want

982
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:53,858
what I can be.

983
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,127
(laughs)

984
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:02,133
-What do you want?

985
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:28,459
-All of them!

986
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,195
Nice, very nice.

987
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:36,634
-All these women have
seven email minimums.

988
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:41,472
That should say, responding
to your single ad.

989
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:44,642
I know you most
certainly aren't married.

990
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:48,446
You can see any one
of them right away.

991
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,251
-Thanks.

992
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:54,685
You've been a great help.

993
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:56,887
-Yes, that's supposed
to be this way.

994
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,057
-What is?

995
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:01,426
-Well, you're not playing fair.

996
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:04,362
-I'm just giving
them what they want.

997
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,200
They have demands

998
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:12,470
and I'm the supplier.

999
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:15,072
-You must realize that

1000
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:20,678
no one is the owner
of their instincts?

1001
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:21,379
But controlling them,
that's civilization.

1002
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:26,617
-You must realize they're beyond
being judged by hypocrites.

1003
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:36,127
(mumbles)

1004
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:39,230
-These people, they don't
advertise themselves

1005
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,731
so they can get used.

1006
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:42,567
They do it so they can
meet somebody cool.

1007
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:46,871
Somebody they can spend the
rest of their lives with.

1008
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:47,472
-And in the
meantime, there's me.

1009
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,511
* Did it fly away

1010
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:00,718
* Where did our love go

1011
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,622
* I gotta get it
back with me someday

1012
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:07,558
* Where did our love go

1013
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,196
* I need to find it right away

1014
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,199
* Lady where did our love go

1015
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:19,270
-Wowee zowee Polly.

1016
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:24,375
-Are you Canadian?

1017
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,147
-No.

1018
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:33,584
-I hate Canadians.

1019
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:37,455
-I'm not Canadian.

1020
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:41,526
-What's the capital of Canada?

1021
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:45,496
-Arizona.

1022
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:51,336
-Ok, let's go.

1023
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,308
-Check please.

1024
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:58,543
-[Voiceover] That'll be 10.70.

1025
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,778
(screams)

1026
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:05,550
-The Obama weeps!

1027
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:07,252
-Daddy go make me some eggs!

1028
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,791
(farts)

1029
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,394
-A healthy sexual
relationship combats insomnia

1030
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,600
and relieves pain.

1031
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,202
-So it was good for you.

1032
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:27,472
-Quite the workout.

1033
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:31,809
I think I just
lost three pounds.

1034
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:35,413
-You're welcome.

1035
00:53:37,482 --> 00:53:37,548
-[Voiceover] For Phil,
living his life a la carte

1036
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,319
made perfect sense.

1037
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:42,787
-Now you have it all.

1038
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:44,088
You've got a monogamous
relationship with

1039
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,591
four different women.

1040
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:46,824
Keep it simple, keep it moving

1041
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,226
and keep on hunting.

1042
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,695
Remember this,

1043
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:52,597
if you're the type of man
that's not paying attention

1044
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:54,332
to his wife,

1045
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:55,333
beware the dog that will.

1046
00:53:58,503 --> 00:53:58,603
-[Voiceover] Phil was in the
fantasy fulfillment business

1047
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,374
and business was good.

1048
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,576
* I look for the answers

1049
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,862
* I look for the truth

1050
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:28,533
* I sense complications

1051
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,603
* From the remnants of you

1052
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,407
* I'm searching for something

1053
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,877
* And I don't ask much

1054
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,814
* I'm longing to break free

1055
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,885
* But I do need your touch

1056
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,789
* And the easy life

1057
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:55,326
* Is all that I'm hoping to find

1058
00:54:57,428 --> 00:54:59,530
* It's that easy life

1059
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:02,900
* Find a man with some money

1060
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:06,404
-Lordy Lordy look who's 40.

1061
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,339
* And become his wife

1062
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:10,741
* Easy life
-Easy life

1063
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:14,579
* Easy life
-Easy life

1064
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,914
-What's it like having
sex with your husband?

1065
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:24,789
-He's not your type.

1066
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:27,658
-I mean, how am I
different than him?

1067
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,396
-You're not asking
me how you measure up

1068
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:37,334
with my husband are you?

1069
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:38,569
-No, of course not.

1070
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:41,606
Size doesn't matter
to men, that's a myth.

1071
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:43,874
-Talk about your buzzkill.

1072
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,346
-I'm sorry.

1073
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:51,849
You just seem so easy to enjoy.

1074
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:54,952
I don't want to make
the same mistakes

1075
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:55,453
your husband made with you.

1076
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:56,854
-I prefer not to
answer that question

1077
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:00,791
while you're still inside of me.

1078
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:02,893
-Just curious that's all.

1079
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:16,974
-Husband sex, ooh the humanity.

1080
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:24,782
-Hey hey!

1081
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:28,719
(whoops up)

1082
00:56:30,655 --> 00:56:33,424
Who's your Easter Bunny?

1083
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:36,661
(grunts)

1084
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:38,663
(unclear) cowboy!

1085
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:39,730
Give me the chance.

1086
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,432
(cap gun pops)

1087
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,000
Touchdown!

1088
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:47,004
-Ugh, sorry I asked.

1089
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,011
-You needed to know.

1090
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,482
-Look,

1091
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:01,686
I'd just like to apologize
for all husbands everywhere.

1092
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:02,953
-I can't accept your apology.

1093
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,023
-Thanks.

1094
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:08,893
-Sure it's not the
same for your wife.

1095
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:12,497
Right?

1096
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:15,633
-So Evelyn, tell us
about your vacation.

1097
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:19,870
You went to your sister's?

1098
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:21,038
-For a little more
than two weeks.

1099
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:22,840
-Wow, how did you maintain?

1100
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:24,575
-Maintain?

1101
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:25,976
-You know.

1102
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:27,578
-Two weeks isn't that long.

1103
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:29,980
-So what's your secret?

1104
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:31,716
How are you both able
to control yourselves

1105
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:33,450
when you're not together?

1106
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:34,451
-You're making the assumption

1107
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:35,853
that we're actually having sex!

1108
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:36,954
How can you possibly
miss something

1109
00:57:37,855 --> 00:57:37,955
when it's not there anymore?

1110
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:38,956
-Phil!

1111
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:39,757
-Evelyn!

1112
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:40,758
-Oh well maybe uh...

1113
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,460
Honey where did you say
those terrorist live?

1114
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:45,596
-It's my own damn fault,
this is the life I chose.

1115
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:47,865
I only did what
everybody else did.

1116
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:49,534
I foolishly gave up myself

1117
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:51,836
in exchange for a marriage
Nirvana that doesn't exist.

1118
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,470
-What?

1119
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:54,772
-We're gonna need a bigger boat.

1120
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:56,006
-It was unrealistic
to begin with.

1121
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:57,474
But I'm Ok with that now

1122
00:57:58,876 --> 00:57:59,076
because there is no Santa Claus.

1123
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:00,945
There's no homosexuals in Iran

1124
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:02,647
and there's no way out
of this sexist quagmire

1125
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:04,481
we call marriage.

1126
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:05,449
-Are you telling me
you want a divorce?

1127
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:07,017
-Abandon ship?

1128
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:08,553
-No, wait a minute.

1129
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:09,654
You two might hear something
that will help you.

1130
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:10,988
We're terminal.

1131
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:11,989
You still have a chance.

1132
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:14,091
-How are we terminal?

1133
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,695
-We're lazy, we're
business, we're roommates.

1134
00:58:17,728 --> 00:58:17,762
We're tired, we're bored,
we're siblings, we're lazy.

1135
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:20,631
-[Evelyn] You said
that all ready.

1136
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:21,632
-We're married.

1137
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:22,833
We're not lovers.

1138
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:24,835
-That sounds like
you're blaming me.

1139
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:25,603
-I said, "We."

1140
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:26,704
-I know what you're
really saying.

1141
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:27,772
I know you.

1142
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:28,973
And you want an explanation.

1143
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:30,741
Well here it is!

1144
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:32,777
It's the quality
of the connection
outside of the bedroom

1145
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:33,978
that makes married sex good.

1146
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:35,846
Once you figure that out sex
will come easier than you do.

1147
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:38,115
-One hand washes the other.

1148
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:39,784
-Get that hand to do
more than washing honey,

1149
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,552
-[Gene] Phil!

1150
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,053
-then we'll talk.

1151
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,288
-That's the woman I love.

1152
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:44,354
-It's so easy to cop out to
some obscure connection issue

1153
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:46,957
that's typical female
rationalization
for being frigid.

1154
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,695
-How hard is it for
you to be a man?

1155
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:50,828
Your righteous sense of
entitlement makes you think

1156
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:52,963
that all the answers
to a healthy marriage

1157
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:54,565
can be solved with an erection.

1158
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:55,900
-Where did you get that idea?

1159
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,001
-From you!

1160
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:58,969
You're so focused on
one part of our marriage

1161
00:58:59,003 --> 00:58:59,670
that you completely
missed the bigger picture.

1162
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,071
-Ok, I agree with you.

1163
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:02,973
Men are pigs,
what's your excuse?

1164
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:03,974
-I've got swine flu.

1165
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:05,876
-[Voiceover] The bed Phil
laid in became uncomfortable.

1166
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,084
-If your wife doesn't
want to have sex again,

1167
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,154
-[Voiceover] He had to change.

1168
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:19,023
-why would I?

1169
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:20,858
Fucking Canadian!

1170
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:23,393
Ok, you were right!

1171
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,997
-Are you listening to me?

1172
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:29,566
Phil--

1173
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:31,568
-[Voiceover] Phil knew
that there was room

1174
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:32,703
for only one female
in his heart.

1175
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:34,171
-You're breaking up with me?

1176
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:36,106
Oh bollocks, look I
can pay you in euros.

1177
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:40,878
-[Voiceover] Phil would
commit now to only one woman

1178
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,149
before the only one
committed was himself.

1179
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,986
-You did all this for me?

1180
00:59:58,663 --> 00:59:59,196
-Thought you might enjoy it.

1181
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:02,633
-It's a little more high profile

1182
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:04,869
than what I'm comfortable with.

1183
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:06,203
-Don't worry about it.

1184
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:08,038
All right, this is for
us, it's a real date.

1185
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:09,740
We're out there
and we deserve it.

1186
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:12,910
-Wish you would
have asked me first.

1187
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:14,745
-Where's that coming from?

1188
01:00:16,981 --> 01:00:17,014
-It's nice dating like
we're a legitimate couple?

1189
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:19,750
That's beyond our
original agreement.

1190
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,119
-What do you mean?

1191
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:23,220
-It crosses a line.

1192
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:25,622
You should be here
with somebody else.

1193
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:28,125
-Yeah well, my wife
wouldn't enjoy this.

1194
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:30,695
-Maybe not, maybe one of
your other girlfriends might.

1195
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:35,132
-I don't have any
other girlfriends.

1196
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:41,806
-Phil, I kept three other
personal ads running.

1197
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,009
You wrote them all.

1198
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:46,677
Same cut and paste intro
from you every time.

1199
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,246
-Why'd you do that?

1200
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:50,647
-Because I'm smart.

1201
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:51,982
I'm smarter than boys.

1202
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,051
-So why didn't
you say something?

1203
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:55,652
Why did you let me
embarrass myself like that?

1204
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:57,988
-I was on vacation.

1205
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:01,926
-So what?

1206
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:03,828
-Relax.

1207
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,096
-I answered some ads but I
don't have another girlfriend.

1208
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,732
-I hope you had fun.

1209
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:11,268
-Why doesn't it bother you?

1210
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,240
-Because it proves my point

1211
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:18,909
that you don't believe in the
fairytale monogamy either.

1212
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,278
That's what made me choose you.

1213
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,280
I felt honest with you.

1214
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:25,682
-I suppose you'd be wanting
your underwear back now.

1215
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,152
-What I want is to keep
things simple, just sex.

1216
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:32,823
You're the perfect man for that.

1217
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:36,060
-So you're saying I'm shallow?

1218
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:36,693
-Uncomplicated.

1219
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:37,962
All of this,

1220
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:39,897
is complicating.

1221
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:41,766
-I hoped things are
different between us.

1222
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,434
I thought we cliqued.

1223
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:44,769
-We did clique,
we double cliqued.

1224
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:46,303
-I need more than that.

1225
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:47,772
-Oh no, you didn't?

1226
01:01:53,778 --> 01:01:56,280
Did you?

1227
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:01,819
-I did what?

1228
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:06,090
-You did!

1229
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:09,960
-I did what?

1230
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:12,262
-We had a deal!

1231
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:13,864
-What deal?

1232
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:15,265
-Don't let me think
I'm in love with you?

1233
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,802
Remember?

1234
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:19,336
-Yeah, I remember.

1235
01:02:21,005 --> 01:02:21,271
-No, you don't remember.

1236
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,742
-Wait a minute.

1237
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:30,848
(dramatic sigh)

1238
01:02:33,183 --> 01:02:33,250
-Goddammit Phil!

1239
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:35,019
I am not going through this
again with another man.

1240
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,923
-Don't leave.

1241
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:40,357
All right, I can change.

1242
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:43,861
-I don't want you to change.

1243
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,832
I don't want you to love me.

1244
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,368
-I don't love you.

1245
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:55,172
-Like hell you don't.

1246
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:03,047
-I like this one.

1247
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:20,197
Do you like this one
(gibberish) very much.

1248
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:25,069
What's this say?

1249
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,370
What's this say?

1250
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:28,338
What's this say momma?

1251
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:32,342
Momma?

1252
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:33,944
Momma?

1253
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:35,179
-At least I still have hands.

1254
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:36,413
Delete already.

1255
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,121
All profiles?

1256
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:49,960
Oh my God!

1257
01:03:58,235 --> 01:03:58,268
-Could you please
explain why your family's

1258
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:32,369
personal ads have
crashed all the computers

1259
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:34,905
on the 22nd floor?

1260
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:35,372
-No.

1261
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:37,341
-Hey Phil?

1262
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:37,474
Aren't you married?

1263
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:39,209
-[Phil] Yes.

1264
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,010
-Is your wife?

1265
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:41,311
(laughter)

1266
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:43,413
-Our employees don't
do such things.

1267
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,149
(razzing)

1268
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:48,018
-[Voiceover] This
is Evelyn Anders.

1269
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,224
And this is her story.

1270
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,360
The following visualizations

1271
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:58,095
were culled from
the Anders web log.

1272
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,064
Now defunct.

1273
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:02,032
-[Voiceover] I haven't
had sex in months.

1274
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:03,500
Even Mother Theresa had
doubts about her man.

1275
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,437
I can't say that
Phil is the problem

1276
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:10,374
or any man.

1277
01:05:12,176 --> 01:05:12,442
My problem has no name.

1278
01:05:14,444 --> 01:05:15,145
-Be that as it may,
you've lamented

1279
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:17,347
in all of our sessions the fact

1280
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:19,516
that your husband
likes Bill Clinton

1281
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,151
for all the wrong reasons?

1282
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:23,087
-Yes.

1283
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:26,290
But even the King of England
wanted to be a tampon.

1284
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:29,359
-Are you defending
your marriage to him?

1285
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:32,196
(exaggerated sigh)

1286
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:33,463
-I prefer not to.

1287
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,399
-You may be surprised you know,

1288
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,502
many others share your problem.

1289
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:39,103
Some studies show
infidelity exists

1290
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:41,938
in 60 percent of
all relationships.

1291
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,208
-Is this all?

1292
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:48,212
What you dream about?

1293
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,380
What's really there?

1294
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:53,250
-So how did you find
yourself a part of this

1295
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:56,086
problem with no name?

1296
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:57,487
* Ice cream soda
pop cherry on top

1297
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:02,959
* Who's your boyfriend
let's find out

1298
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,563
-[Voiceover] From the beginning,

1299
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:08,398
Evelyn resented the
idea that little girls

1300
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:10,434
should use their happiness
on a handsome prince.

1301
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:13,303
-G, George is your boyfriend.

1302
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:15,972
-No, not George.

1303
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,242
-George is your boyfriend.

1304
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:19,976
-Why can't I be best friends?

1305
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:21,978
(unclear)

1306
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:24,414
-[Voiceover] Her
dissatisfaction began then too.

1307
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:29,053
-The men in my
life never matched

1308
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:30,254
the heroes I saw in movies

1309
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:31,521
or heard about in love songs.

1310
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:33,023
-Reality bites don't it?

1311
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:34,491
-You're one to talk,
Mister President.

1312
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,593
-So I may have shared
my bed with another

1313
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:38,128
dude in my youth, big deal!

1314
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:40,097
The LA winters
are freggin' cold.

1315
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:41,598
And the summers
are hot, hot, hot!

1316
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,034
-Fall colors in Arizona,
simply beautiful.

1317
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,606
-This is my favorite
place to travel.

1318
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:52,476
-How do you cope with
society's opinion of

1319
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:55,112
what you should be and who
you really are, Black Jesus?

1320
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:58,615
-I remind them that I
called everyone my brother,

1321
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:02,619
likes gospel music and
couldn't get a fair trial.

1322
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:06,590
-Just talking about
it doesn't work.

1323
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:10,294
-Then, get their
attention somehow,

1324
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,563
Old Testament style!

1325
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:17,267
-I wish I was that
brave, but I'm not.

1326
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:21,037
Everyone gets married because
it's a check box in life.

1327
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,310
Anyways, I'm much too
much of a coward to be

1328
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:30,614
selfish and single.

1329
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:31,181
Every guy that ever liked me

1330
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:32,582
just long enough to
get into my pants.

1331
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:34,318
-Then you need to find out not
why someone should get married

1332
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,653
but why they don't get divorced.

1333
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:38,355
-Thank you, I know
just who to ask.

1334
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:43,660
-Hey, you shook my hand.

1335
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:49,099
That's a hand job, (whoops up)!

1336
01:07:49,866 --> 01:07:52,302
(laughter)

1337
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,475
-So, mom, dad 42
years of marriage,

1338
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,212
was it worth it?

1339
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,181
-The fellatio could
have been better

1340
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,615
but all in all, I
would wager it was.

1341
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,085
-He's an ass clown but he's,

1342
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,688
he's my ass clown.

1343
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:13,490
-But you two argue all the time.

1344
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:15,091
-He just gets this way
around his offspring.

1345
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:17,361
You know, he has to feel like
he's the cock of the walk.

1346
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,464
-Here's another hot flash
grandma, I don't either.

1347
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,400
-Why do you sleep
in separate rooms?

1348
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,236
-Why not?

1349
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:26,470
-Because we can.

1350
01:08:27,371 --> 01:08:27,504
-It's not what you'd expect.

1351
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:28,938
I mean you suppose
to be married,

1352
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:30,507
together.

1353
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:32,176
-Our independence
makes our togetherness

1354
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:33,443
more bearable.

1355
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:34,711
-Did you ever think
about divorce?

1356
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:36,713
-You mean today?

1357
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:38,548
-Sure, especially when he
was thinking with his dick.

1358
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,385
-Well, why didn't you
divorce back then?

1359
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,520
-When your dad had
his girlfriend,

1360
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:45,355
I knew it was partly my fault.

1361
01:08:47,224 --> 01:08:48,192
Sex was so important
to him, but not to me.

1362
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:51,261
-I'd like to kick the
guy who invented those

1363
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:53,463
boner pills right in the nuts.

1364
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:55,165
-See men can't blame
themselves for why

1365
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,435
they're cheating on their wives.

1366
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:00,136
So they don't think
cheating's bad,

1367
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:02,539
but let their wives fool
around then they'd understand.

1368
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,375
-I remember wishing that you
would have gotten a divorce,

1369
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:07,211
I was so sick of being
around all the arguing!

1370
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:10,580
-It would have been
worse on you kids

1371
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:11,448
if we would have split.

1372
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:13,683
You don't know it but
I did you a favor.

1373
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:15,619
-Why did you let him stay, mom?

1374
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:18,255
-I knew I could have
castrated him financially

1375
01:09:19,223 --> 01:09:20,757
and found somebody new

1376
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:23,293
but why would I ever want
to train another man?

1377
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:26,430
Screw that!

1378
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:28,265
-And what do you have
when the shiny hotness

1379
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,433
wear off your lover?

1380
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:30,600
Just another wife?

1381
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:32,469
-Plus he's this close
to a slight stroke.

1382
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:35,305
Maybe then he'll shut up more
when I spend his retirement.

1383
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:38,775
-[Dad] Cheers.

1384
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:41,611
-[Voiceover] One day it was the
4369 day Evelyn was married,

1385
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:46,450
-This isn't working.

1386
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:52,722
-Any special requests?

1387
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:55,792
-Let's just do it.

1388
01:09:58,728 --> 01:09:58,795
-I wanna try
something different.

1389
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:02,198
-Like what?

1390
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:05,201
-Relax, close your eyes.

1391
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:10,407
-You better not
do anything weird.

1392
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:15,645
I don't feel clean.

1393
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:18,815
-It's Ok, really.

1394
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:21,618
-What is that?

1395
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:28,825
-Nothing.

1396
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:30,627
-No really, what is that?

1397
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:31,395
-Nothing!

1398
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:32,796
It's um...

1399
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:33,797
-My electric toothbrush?

1400
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:34,230
-I thought you might like a toy.

1401
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:35,832
-I brush my teeth
with that Phillip.

1402
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:37,834
-Well it is good for cavities.

1403
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:40,370
-That's not even
close to being funny.

1404
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:43,239
-I wasn't gonna
use the brush end.

1405
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:44,674
I mean unless you're
into the sort of thing.

1406
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,844
-Just get the lube.

1407
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:49,613
-I love when you talk sexy.

1408
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,248
-I'm warning you.

1409
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:56,453
-The great cultural
anthropologist Margaret
Mead once said,

1410
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:04,861
"Every woman needs
three husbands."

1411
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,864
-Three husbands?

1412
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:09,499
God was she drunk?

1413
01:11:10,467 --> 01:11:10,800
-One for youthful sex.

1414
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:13,437
One for security as
she raises her children

1415
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,406
and one for the joyful
companionship of old age.

1416
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:19,275
Do you see all three in Phil?

1417
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,681
-The great rock singer
Meatloaf once said,

1418
01:11:26,683 --> 01:11:28,284
"Two out of three and bad."

1419
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:29,886
-You just rolled off a bunch
of your husband's faults.

1420
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,889
Why are you protecting him now?

1421
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:34,891
-Victim's remorse.

1422
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:37,727
-Is why you haven't divorced?

1423
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:39,796
-I don't wanna cut and
run like some democrat.

1424
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:42,566
Divorce feels like
failure to me.

1425
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:44,701
Plus the world doesn't
need another single mother.

1426
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,571
-Divorce my dear is
in fact something

1427
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:50,674
that takes much
bravery to accomplish.

1428
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,477
Courage you evidently lack.

1429
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,513
-I don't wanna be
older and alone

1430
01:11:58,448 --> 01:11:58,915
just because I'm angry now.

1431
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:00,917
-If I could make a fist,

1432
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:03,820
I'd punch you in the labia.

1433
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:06,322
-We're both right.

1434
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:08,825
Divorce is a good
reason to stay married

1435
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,495
but marriage is the number
one reason for divorce.

1436
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,731
-You're far too
young to be already

1437
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:18,802
waiting out the clock.

1438
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:24,808
-Even still, my connection
with my husband 404,

1439
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,478
-Phil's already two of
your three husbands.

1440
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:31,581
Who is your third man?

1441
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:33,783
* He's a preacher with an iPod

1442
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,557
* And a WiFi for Jesus

1443
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,962
* And he's cruising eternity

1444
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,569
* Looking for some action

1445
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,374
-[Voiceover] Evelyn's
hero was someone full of

1446
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,512
(unclear), mystery
and surprises.

1447
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,981
* Gotta watch out
for the trap of hell

1448
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,718
* Devil's gonna get you

1449
01:13:09,653 --> 01:13:09,986
* 'Cause you are in

1450
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:11,988
-Hydrogen Monoxide is the
primary component of acid rain.

1451
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:17,727
It can cause severe burns,

1452
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,630
cut through solid rock

1453
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:22,398
and have been found in the
tumors of cancer victims.

1454
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,535
The terrorist are using
dihydrogen monoxide

1455
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:30,940
to this day America.

1456
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:31,675
Now what are you
going to do about it?

1457
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,444
-I want my baby to be
dihydrogen monoxide free.

1458
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:37,413
We have to bomb all
the dihydrogen monoxide

1459
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,649
before they use it on us.

1460
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:41,451
-(mumbles) vote no against
their dihydrogen monoxide.

1461
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:44,754
(screeching)

1462
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:48,692
-The term dihydrogen
monoxide means

1463
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:00,436
two parts hydrogen,
one part oxygen.

1464
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:04,674
H2o.

1465
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:08,845
Nice job guys.

1466
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:10,847
You just demonized water.

1467
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:12,982
-[Voiceover] For Evelyn, when
the world would go insane,

1468
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:16,986
her hero would know how to
make her feel safe and secure.

1469
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,990
So Evelyn queried the
website, Love a la Carte

1470
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,728
to see if it could
find what she couldn't,

1471
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:27,063
her whole life.

1472
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:37,541
-Team work is a lot of
people doing what I say.

1473
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:38,608
Doing it right is no excuse
for not meeting the schedule.

1474
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,611
-It's so important that you
couldn't let other things

1475
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:45,248
that are more important
fear it, right?

1476
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:45,882
-So, since we've
established a relationship

1477
01:14:47,751 --> 01:14:48,685
may I have sex with you now?

1478
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:51,087
-[Voiceover] Filtering
out the dirty old men

1479
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:53,623
for Evelyn was just as
easy as spotting the

1480
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:56,025
slick, habitual cheaters.

1481
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,528
But Evelyn, you're still
young and attractive,

1482
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:03,499
yet your husband
still ignores you?

1483
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:06,936
How can it be?!

1484
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:09,906
-Are you Ok?

1485
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:11,875
-Do you feel that?

1486
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:17,080
That is the sound
of your empty heart

1487
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:21,117
and I'm here to replenish it.

1488
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:23,587
You deserve satisfaction.

1489
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:28,124
-And therefore, as a man it
is my duty to service you.

1490
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:33,129
No reciprocation necessary.

1491
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:38,134
-Die!

1492
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:40,637
No wonder whores get
such good business,

1493
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:43,006
they charge you because
it's so much fucking work!

1494
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:45,675
-Call me!

1495
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:48,712
-[Voiceover] Evelyn
soon realized

1496
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:51,915
that while looking
for Prince Charming,

1497
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:53,883
she forgot to consider
again the man at home.

1498
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,152
-Why wasn't the
front door locked?

1499
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:57,854
-Sorry, I forgot.

1500
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:00,724
-[Voiceover] But by
then, it was too late.

1501
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:01,157
Evelyn was the one who
left her world unlocked.

1502
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,694
Her husband simply
left to find the key.

1503
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,864
He would have to find out
on his own what I know now.

1504
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,970
Every star wants a fan.

1505
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:16,706
Every player wants
a cheerleader.

1506
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:18,975
But the sweetest applause
you'll ever receive

1507
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:21,745
comes from the one that
unconditionally loves you.

1508
01:16:23,146 --> 01:16:24,781
-Yeah, I know who you are.

1509
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,212
-He's all yours.

1510
01:16:58,381 --> 01:16:59,215
-Don't flatter yourself.

1511
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:04,220
-Do you know why I could
have him whenever I wanted?

1512
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,962
-Oh I can't wait!

1513
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:16,032
-I am the forbidden
fruit that quenches

1514
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,037
your husband's starved libido.

1515
01:17:22,438 --> 01:17:23,106
-(unclear) Phil driven him out
of the home to find, Evelyn.

1516
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:30,013
And when I'm satisfied I
don't have to hear him snore

1517
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,116
or wash his dirty underwear,

1518
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:34,918
I just send him home.

1519
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,021
You'll make him miserable again

1520
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:40,056
but he'll dream

1521
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:42,025
of me.

1522
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:44,260
-Suck my phoenix.

1523
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:47,230
I don't feel the female
version of emasculation

1524
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,201
when a man cheats.

1525
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:53,269
I see it for the
weakness that it is.

1526
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:56,072
That's why a husband
always comes back home

1527
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:59,275
to his wife.

1528
01:18:00,977 --> 01:18:01,044
Even a dog like Phil knows
that you're not worth

1529
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:02,678
what he would lose with
me if I ever strayed

1530
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:05,281
because it would be proof
that I no longer loved him.

1531
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:08,284
And they lived
happily, never after.

1532
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:12,288
-I figure there are many models
of marriage that are viable.

1533
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:19,295
Mine may not be perfect but

1534
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:22,298
it'll have to do.

1535
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:24,067
-In writing your blog,

1536
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,037
the comments from anonymous
souls on the internet,

1537
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,238
it's helped you hasn't it?

1538
01:18:31,074 --> 01:18:31,307
-Yeah, I'm shutting it down.

1539
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,844
-Why?

1540
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:36,980
-Too maddening thinking
about all the possibilities.

1541
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:40,784
-The truth is you determine
the life that you live.

1542
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,754
Why do you choose to live a lie?

1543
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:46,990
-There was one man who
helped explain me to myself

1544
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,728
with a framework I could
finally understand.

1545
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,330
-He connected with you.

1546
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:57,801
-In more ways than
he would allow me.

1547
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:00,804
He that I could not have.

1548
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:02,772
Still he helped me
believe my vows again.

1549
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,942
Sent me a telegram once.

1550
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:07,743
-Always remember that
forgiving someone

1551
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:12,982
justifies your own forgiveness.

1552
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:14,283
-That was it.

1553
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,019
To me it's proof that

1554
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:17,987
freedom beating heroism
can still exist,

1555
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:19,956
even in a struggling marriage.

1556
01:19:21,557 --> 01:19:22,358
* Cinderella dressed in yellow

1557
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,830
* Went upstairs to kiss a fella

1558
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:30,900
* Made a mistake
and kissed a snake

1559
01:19:32,135 --> 01:19:34,770
* How many doctors did it take

1560
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,374
-Princess Evelyn, you
magnificent bitch!

1561
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,110
I read your posts.

1562
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:42,278
-Imagine that.

1563
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:44,080
It's a small world wide web
after all isn't it, Phil?

1564
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,315
-How you felt
about our marriage,

1565
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:47,951
why we're not communicating,

1566
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:49,118
why couldn't you
tell me those things?

1567
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:50,954
-I did!

1568
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:51,955
I could have said more.

1569
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:53,389
-But it would have been wasted?

1570
01:19:54,323 --> 01:19:55,158
-Probably.

1571
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:56,625
-You know you really know
how to stomp on a guy's ball.

1572
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:58,361
I mean, bravo.

1573
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:00,063
-You can appreciate
that can you?

1574
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,065
-This marriage sucks anus!

1575
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,067
-It is not a competition, Phil!

1576
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:06,102
-Yeah, well in the
court of world opinion,

1577
01:20:06,602 --> 01:20:07,937
I lose!

1578
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:09,839
How were you gonna explain
this to Black Jesus?

1579
01:20:09,873 --> 01:20:10,806
-We could go Hindu.

1580
01:20:12,075 --> 01:20:12,341
-I don't know, all that curry.

1581
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:14,043
-Do you think there is any way
we can repair our marriage?

1582
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:15,845
-Marriage by default isn't a
success until death do us part.

1583
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,815
-You first!

1584
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:21,417
-What is it my love?

1585
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:36,900
-I want you to be
my lady friend.

1586
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:38,267
-Alas, I'm married.

1587
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:39,869
-Oh forsake your husband I say.

1588
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:41,437
-Prey tail why?

1589
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:43,006
-For he knows not how to
make a wife feel loved.

1590
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:44,773
I however realized what
most men never learn.

1591
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:47,944
-What's that my prince?

1592
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:49,445
-Pussy is pussy,

1593
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:52,448
they're all the same.

1594
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:54,250
What matter is the person,
and that's you my love.

1595
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:56,252
Too many men only think
of their tallywackers but

1596
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:58,154
I say refuse to let my
tallywacker define me anymore.

1597
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:02,959
-So romantic.

1598
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:07,096
-But I also want the
life of least resistance.

1599
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:09,465
And that mean true
love and happy penis

1600
01:21:10,433 --> 01:21:11,034
with only one person.

1601
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:12,235
So I unconditionally
surrender myself to you.

1602
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,104
-You do?

1603
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:16,005
-For certain!

1604
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:17,273
I have enough respect
for you to know

1605
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:19,475
you could do much better than I

1606
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,344
but our differences
aren't so irreconcilable.

1607
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:24,213
Would you return the key
to your heart once more?

1608
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,916
-Of course, you're my hero.

1609
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:28,384
-Oh sweet, precious darling,
let us never quarrel again.

1610
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,489
-(mumbles)

1611
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,159
-[Both] Hib hib hooray!

1612
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:37,927
-[Voiceover] Love a la Carte

1613
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,097
was brought to you by

1614
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:42,531
Vacation Saturn, you
like our hot boobs,

1615
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:46,235
you'll love our xenophobia.

1616
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:48,271
And by kumquats.

1617
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:51,207
And by the great
nation of Mexico,

1618
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:55,244
just like Canada but with a tan.

1619
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:57,981
-It doesn't have to
end like this Evelyn.

1620
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:04,520
Please, don't let it happen.

1621
01:22:07,056 --> 01:22:07,190
-Every story has to
have an ending, Phil.

1622
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,059
What's it gonna be?

1623
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:11,460
-Isn't it possible to forgive?

1624
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:13,529
-Sure, but it's forgetting

1625
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:16,132
and moving on that's
the hard part.

1626
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:17,533
-Yeah but we don't have
to nuke our entire world.

1627
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:20,336
You know there's still good
reason for us to be together.

1628
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:24,073
-(unclear) is the
enforcement of stupid laws.

1629
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:26,942
I do want to stay with you.

1630
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:29,345
I often wonder exactly why.

1631
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,082
-Well for one thing I do a
lot of things mostly right?

1632
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:35,551
Plus we've got the
same last name,

1633
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:38,521
that's got to be a bonus.

1634
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:40,189
-This species aren't
even the best.

1635
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:41,557
Your nuisance for
bread is overwhelming.

1636
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:43,559
Most likely it's because
neither one of us

1637
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,196
has a better choice.

1638
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:48,497
-Yeah, I can live with that.

1639
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:51,034
-You're reaching for
a happy ending but

1640
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:53,969
out story's still being
written and it's an epic,

1641
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,372
a constant battle to
try to find the reasons

1642
01:22:58,107 --> 01:22:59,142
that we should stay together.

1643
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:00,443
-Let's write our own
chapter, our chapter 13.

1644
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:03,046
-Bankruptcy?

1645
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:04,080
-We're broke.

1646
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:05,514
Let's get solvent sexy pants.

1647
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:07,383
You wanna go see a movie?

1648
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:10,786
-I want to take a vacation,
before I go back to work.

1649
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,255
-You're gonna start
your career again?

1650
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:14,190
How serendipitous, my
unemployment insurance

1651
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,493
lasts for 13 weeks,
let's do this!

1652
01:23:17,526 --> 01:23:19,495
-You lost your job?

1653
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:21,397
So you're gonna be
the one staying home?

1654
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:24,267
-Gone in there and make
me a damn sandwich bitch!

1655
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:28,003
-Not tonight, I have a headache.

1656
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:30,273
-Seriously, I want
a good vacation.

1657
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:33,609
-We could go to Tijuana.

1658
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:35,278
We could bring back
some cheap medication.

1659
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:37,480
How long is your anal cavity?

1660
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:40,383
-I wanna go see America,
before they close it down.

1661
01:23:41,817 --> 01:23:44,187
-Wow, oh wow!

1662
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:54,163
If I was a female you would
totally be questioning

1663
01:23:55,731 --> 01:23:56,099
your sexuality right now.

1664
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:57,633
-Keep dreaming.

1665
01:23:59,635 --> 01:23:59,668
-Thanks for continuing
to be my wife.

1666
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,411
I love you, I love you.

1667
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:12,648
-I love you too.

1668
01:24:15,518 --> 01:24:16,352
-It's over.

1669
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:27,630
-That's a relief.

1670
01:24:32,468 --> 01:24:32,668
-I don't want to
be a third wheel.

1671
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:43,078
-Wanna go with us instead?

1672
01:24:45,548 --> 01:24:46,515
-Yeah, I do.

1673
01:24:52,355 --> 01:24:54,123
(groans of disgust)

1674
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:00,229
-Let's go amigos!

1675
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:05,434
* Sometimes it stops (unclear)

1676
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:07,536
* Feels like it never ceases

1677
01:25:08,371 --> 01:25:10,273
* And all that you found

1678
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,909
* (unclear)

1679
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,378
* Please Mister
please play one for me

1680
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:20,683
* Her man of her's

1681
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:27,723
* He's learned a lesson

1682
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:30,393
* Not to keep a good
man second guessing

1683
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:35,164
* She's gonna show
him what she needs

1684
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:40,736
* If you wanna be
if you wanna be

1685
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:47,410
* If you wanna be
the love of my life

1686
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:50,346
* If you wanna be
if you wanna be

1687
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:52,381
* If you wanna be
the love of my life.

1688
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:55,284
* I've had enough of it

1689
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:59,422
* Right now

1690
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:02,391
* I see part of you

1691
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:17,473
* Wants to think about it

1692
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:20,309
* But the rest of you

1693
01:26:21,577 --> 01:26:22,678
* Just can't be without it

1694
01:26:23,446 --> 01:26:25,348
-It get's better!

1695
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:28,417
* If you wanna be
if you wanna be

1696
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:37,593
* If you wanna be
the love of my life

1697
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,429
* If you wanna be
if you wanna be

1698
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:42,465
* If you wanna be
the love of my life

1699
01:26:43,466 --> 01:26:45,468
* I have an opening right now

1700
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:50,806
-I was in the West
End, I played Guinevere

1701
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,578
in front of the Queen
and now look at me.

1702
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:57,580
This is ridiculous,
I can't believe this.

1703
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:00,516
Look what I've got to
put up with, this one.

1704
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,619
And these, 3 bras,
it's ridiculous.

1705
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,655
-Hey baby, what are you doing?

1706
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:07,823
-Oh God, come here.

1707
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:09,625
I like it really.

1708
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:18,834
-Here we go, no I don't
like it and action.

1709
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:23,439
-No (laughter).

1710
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,843
-I couldn't let things
that were more important.

1711
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:30,546
Other things that
were more important.

1712
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:32,648
-So it seems we've
established a relationship.

1713
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,385
May I have sex with you now?

1714
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,321
(slurps)

1715
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:40,589
Excellent!

1716
01:27:40,623 --> 01:27:41,424
-Is that a yes?

1717
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:42,858
-Let me grab my water bottle.

1718
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:46,629
-Sure.

1719
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:46,829
-Sorry, sorry sorry, go ahead.
