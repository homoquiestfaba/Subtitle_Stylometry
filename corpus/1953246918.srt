1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000

2
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
  Evans!

3
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,080
  Don't come!

4
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,080
  LONDON, June 13, 1923

5
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,680
  Those ruffians dead Gods
shan't have it all their own way.

6
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,320
  Those gods who never lose 
a chance of hurting, foughting ...

7
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,440
  and spoiling human lives ...

8
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
  are seriously put out
if all the same, you behave like a lady.

9
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,680
  Of course, now I think there are no 
 Gods and there's no one to blame.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
  It's so very dangerous to live 
 for only one day.

11
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,080
 I buy the flowers myself, Lucy. 
 Yes, ma'am.

12
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
  And Mrs Walker 
said not to forget that

13
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,040
  Rumplemayers's men
 will be here at eleven.

14
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,560
I won't forget.

15
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,400
  Oh, what a day, Lucy! 
What a day for my party.

16
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,080
What a luck!

17
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,600
What a plunge!

18
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
  What a plunge!

19
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,480
  Good morning to you, Clarissa. 
 Hugh!

20
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,920
And where are you off to? 
 To buy flowers for my party.

21
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,240
  I love walking in London on a day
like this. It's better that in the country.

22
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,000
  Evelyn wouldn't agree with you there. 
 She can't bear coming out to town.

23
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,880
  I had to get her to come up to see W. Bud.

24
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
He's putting her in a nursing home, 
 for a few days.

25
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
  Nothing serious?

26
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,600
  No, nothing serious. She's just a good deal 
out of salts.

27
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,680
  The war may be over, 
 but there is still the echoe of it.

28
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,600
The Boxborough boy
 was killed, you know ...

29
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,560
  and she is very close
to Lady Boxborough.

30
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,520
  And Evelyn takes things badly.

31
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,080
Yes, one does still hear dreadful stories.

32
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,360
  I must get on. The'll be waiting for this, 
 at the palace.

33
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,520
  Will you still come to my party tonight?

34
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,760
  Oh, yes! Evelyn absolutly insists I go.

35
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,200
  Hugh Whitbread. I can forgive you 
 liking him, Clarissa.

36
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,000
 He's a buffon. Even when he plays tennis, 
 his hair doesn't move.

37
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,400
 He's a barbers block. An imbecil. 
He thinks of nothing but his clothes.

38
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,160
  I like him.

39
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,640
  How can you? He's never read anything. 
Never thought anything.

40
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,240
 Never felt anything!

41
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,840
Stabel boys are more likeable than
Hugh.

42
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,720
  Sally says 
 he tried to kiss her in the smoking-room.

43
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,640
 Oh! 
 She didn't let him? She rather die first.

44
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,120
 Good for Sally. She sees through that  
 public school nonsense.

45
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
  Old manners and breeding.

46
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,160
  No country but England 
  could have produced Hugh.

47
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,560
  He is sweet and unselfish 
 and he's very good to his mother.

48
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,880
  You're so sentimental, Clarissa!

49
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
  And you're impossible!

50
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,240
  Oh, what beautiful flowers! 
That's absolutly wonderful, Sally.

51
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,200
  Oh, I thought Sally could be trusted 
to do the flowers.

52
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,960
That's wicked. To cut off the heads 
 of those flowers. Really...

53
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,400
  I think they're beautiful.

54
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,760
  Peter, look at the flowers.

55
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,520
Yes.

56
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,800
  Roses for the hall, I think.

57
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,680
 And sweet peas for the table, 
 perhaps?

58
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
  Yes! Sweet pea to the table. 
 It will be perfect!

59
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,360
  Those awful motorcars.

60
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,480
  Yes 
 Of course, it was a car.

61
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,160
  - I'm loose it here. 
 - Septimus, please. We must go on.

62
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,720
I'm loose it here, 
and I don't know with what purpose.

63
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,320
  Septimus, please, poeple are looking at us. 
Am I blocking the way?

64
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,000
 Allright, then.

65
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
Bye, Mrs. Dalloway.

66
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,440
  Mrs. Dalloway, Mrs. Dalloway. 
 I'm not even Clarissa anymore.

67
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,960
  No more marrying, no more having children. 
Just Mrs. Dalloway.

68
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,040
  Mrs.  Richard Dalloway, 
who's to give a party.

69
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,720
You'll marry
 a prime minister ...

70
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
  and stand 
 at the top of the staircase.

71
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,640
Who'll give parties. 
You'll be the perfect hostess.

72
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,960
  You have the makings 
 of a perfect hostess.

73
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,040
  You could do so much, 
 be so much.

74
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,560
  What you want me to be?

75
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,360
  Life seems to me to be very dangerous.

76
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,080
  But one must live life 
dangerously!

77
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,400
  Look! Look, Septimus!

78
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,640
  Is no crime.

79
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,960
  There is no death.

80
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
  The birds are singing in Greek.

81
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,640
  The whole world is clamouring. 
 "Kill yourself!" "Kill yourself!"

82
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,640
  Septimus, I'm going to walk to the lake and back.

83
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,640
  "Kreemo". It says "Kreemo".

84
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
  -So revigorating. 
 - I know what you meen.

85
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,680
  The bushies, the flowers. 
So well kept.

86
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,960
  Yes, this is a wonderful garden. 
Beautiful.

87
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,160
  You should see the Milan gardens! 


88
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,600
What a strange person. 
 She's a foreigner.

89
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,880
  Make it now ...  Make it now ...

90
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,280
  But there is a God! 
 No one kills from hatred!

91
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,520
  Evans!

92
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
  For God sake! Don't come!

93
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,720
  T. .. O. ..

94
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
  F. .. F. ..

95
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,280
  E. .. And!

96
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,720
 It says "toffee"! 
 I know it's "toffee".

97
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,120
Look, Lucy.

98
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,160
It sayed "Kreemo toffee".

99
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
  There was a phone message, ma'am. Mr. Dalloway 
sayed to tell you he would not be home for lunch.

100
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
He would be lunching at lady Bruton's.

101
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
He did!

102
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,640
  Lady Bruton. Well...

103
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,440
  Clarissa, my darling. Parliament 
 sits so late ...

104
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,320
  and the doctor said 
 you must get your rest.

105
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,160
 You must sleep undisturbed.

106
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,080
  Fear no more the heat of the sun ...

107
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,080
  nor the furious winter's rages.

108
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,480
 It's all over for me.

109
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
The sheets stretched and  
 the bed narrow.

110
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,920
  What we need to do is abolish 
 private property ...

111
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,880
  because that really is what
causes all the problems.

112
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,080
  Let's write 
 a letter to the Times about it.

113
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
Then, we should found 
 a society ...

114
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,680
  to abolish private property 
and do away with it forever and ever.

115
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,560
  This house as well?

116
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,160
  You always 
look so virginal, Clarissa!

117
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,760
  I am virginal.

118
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
  Are you in love with Peter?

119
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,640
  Oh, love...

120
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,920
I don't know.

121
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,360
  But you love me?

122
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,880
  Damn and blust! I left my sponge 
 in the bathroom.

123
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Tell me to go and get it, like this!

124
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,720
  You wouldn't! 
I would!

125
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
  Is it all over for me?

126
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,400
  I've come up to the tower and left them all 
 blackberrying in the sun.

127
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,640
  Don't run, Clarissa! 
 Young ladies don't run.

128
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,880
  Leipzig is good, but I think
 Heidelberg is beautiful...

129
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,840
  especially this time of year. 
 The "Philosopher's Walk".

130
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
  It reminds me very much of here, 
 with the gardens.

131
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,200
  You are most fortunate the way 
your gardens are done.

132
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,920
  And you have many trees. The colors and
the way it's all been orchestrated.

133
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,000
  It's tremendously fine. I think this is a great 
achievement of the English garden.

134
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
  "Love in her sunny eyes, 
 just basking play.

135
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,080
    Love walks the pleasant
 mazes of her hair. "

136
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,880
  "Love does both on her lips, 
 forever stray...

137
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,000
  and saws and reaps 
 a thousand kisses there."

138
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,440
  "N'or all her outfought parts
  love's always seen ...

139
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,520
  but, oh, he never went within."

140
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,840
  Clarissa.

141
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,120
  What?

142
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,560
 The men leed such 
exciting lives ...

143
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,040
  but their poor wives 
don't seems to do so well.

144
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,240
  Marriage is a catastrophe 
 for women.

145
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,360
  But it is inevitable, isn't it?

146
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,640
  Sally ...

147
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,280
  Will we always be together?

148
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,480
Always! Always!

149
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,520
  We'll do everything together. 
We'll change the world! Come on.

150
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,480
  Oh, Lucy!

151
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,040
  Silver does look nice.

152
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,120
  The doors are of the hangers in 
the dining room, ma'am.

153
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,360
  And Rumplemayers's men
 will be here soon.

154
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,520
  Can I help you with that, ma'am? 
 No, Lucy.

155
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,240
  You've got enough to do.

156
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,240
Star gazing, are we?

157
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,040
  Yes.

158
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,800
  Come on, Joseph. You know the stars, 
 you can tell us which is which.

159
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,320
  You see that star, 
 just above the horizon?

160
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
  Yes. 
That's Antares.

161
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,760
  Heart of the Scorpio
constellation.

162
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,400
  He's name means 
 "rival of Mars."

163
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,480
And that one?

164
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,000
Ask Libra, we have Alpha. 
There goes bright star.

165
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,280
  And see how Altair, the  
 brightest star of equality Eagle...

166
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,720
  shines in the east for us today.

167
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,880
  Ms. Kilman and I are going out. 
Is there anything we can get for you, Mother?

168
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,160
  Where are you going, Elisabeth dear?

169
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,040
  Ms. Kilman is taking me
 to meet the Rev. Whitacker.

170
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,000
  Reverend Whitacker. Ah, yes.

171
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,720
Wasn't he the very instrument
 in your conversion, Ms. Kilman?

172
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,240
  Yes, he helped bring me 
 to our Lord.

173
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,880
And is today's visit part of 
 the history lesson?

174
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,360
  The reverend Whitacker is also 
a historian, Mother.

175
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,280
  He can put this true religion 
 in a proper perspective.

176
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,680
  I wonder what that is.

177
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,000
  I've never wanted to convert anyone, I hope. 
 I just want everyone to be themselves.

178
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,440
I've often thought that religious fanaticism 
 can make a person ...

179
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,040
  rather careless.

180
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,520
  Mother! We just going to talk to him.

181
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,960
You won't forget about my party 
tonight, Elizabeth!

182
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,080
  I was going to help Mrs. Kilman 
 sort the clothes for the mission.

183
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,760
  Well, I dare say Ms. Kilman could 
spare you for one evening.

184
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,920
  I'll see, Mother. We must go, 
 or we'll be late.

185
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,400
  It all seems useless. Going on being in love. 
Going on quarreling.

186
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,920
  Going on making out. 
 But Peter, you want so much from me!

187
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,320
  You leave me nothing to myself. 
 You want every little bit of me!

188
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,120
  Well, I do! I want us
 to be everything to each other.

189
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,680
  But that's all so suffocating!

190
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,040
  God! God! God!

191
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
  Peter Walsh!

192
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,760
  Clarissa. 
 Peter!

193
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,880
  But you're in India.

194
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,440
  No, didn't you get my last letter? 
 I said I'd be here in June.

195
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,160
  No. Your last letter said
that you might be back ...

196
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,080
But I never suspected it.

197
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,160
  It's extraordinary how Peter 
 can put me in this state, just by coming here.

198
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,080
  He looks awfully well.

199
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,880
  It's heavenly to see you again, Peter.

200
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,240
  I arrived last night.

201
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,040
  Playing with his knife. 
 How is everything? How are you?

202
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,320
  Oh, so like him. 
 How is Richard?

203
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,760
  Richard's with some committee. 
 Something to do with his constituents.

204
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,440
  What's this? What's all this here?

205
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,800
  I'm mending my dress. 
 It's for my party tonight.

206
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,360
Which I shan't invite you to, 
 my dear Peter.

207
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,680
  Why? 
 Why won't you ask me?

208
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,280
 It is extraordinary that
 you shown up this morning.

209
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,080
  I've been thinking 
 about Bordon all day.

210
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,040
  I heard about your father. 
I should've written to you, of course.

211
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,560
  Although I never really got on with him. 
He never liked anyone who...

212
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,600
who wanted to marry you.

213
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,120
  Herbert has Bordon now. 
 I never go there.

214
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,640
  And what happened to you? 
 Millions of things.

215
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,720
Should I tell you?

216
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,840
 Should I make a clean brast of it?

217
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,240
  I'm in love, I'm in love with a girl 
 in India.

218
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,920
  And who is she? 
A younger woman, of course.

219
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,080
  Well, I'm not old, you know? 
 My life isn't over not by any means.

220
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
  Well, you of course ...

221
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,080
think me as a failure, 
 wich I suppose I am compared to all that.

222
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,040
  But who is she? Tell me.

223
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,000
  A married woman. 
 Unfortunately.

224
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,240
  She's the wife of a major 
 in the Indian Army.

225
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,400
 She has two young children, 
 a boy and a girl.

226
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,160
  And it's a bit of a mess.

227
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,840
 I'm here to see the lawyers 
 about a divorce.

228
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,840
  Just called Daisy.

229
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,400
Yes?

230
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,400
  Yes

231
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,840
  But what should you do?

232
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,600
The lawyers and the solicitors
they can judge...

233
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,640
 For heaven's sake, 
leave that knife alone!

234
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,920
  I know what I'm up against.

235
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,800
   I know what I'm up against.

236
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,840
 All is all up! And am I behaving like a fool, 
 weepping, being emotional!

237
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,840
  Probably annoyed you, 
turning up at this hour ...

238
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,480
  and told you everything, 
 as usual?

239
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,320
  Are you happy, Clarissa? 
 Does Richard ...

240
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,560
  Excuse me, ma'am. The gentlemen
 are here from Rumplemayers.

241
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,520
  Oh, thank you, Lucy.

242
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,160
  Good bye, Clarissa.

243
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,840
  My party tonight

244
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,160
  Please come to my party, 
 tonight.

245
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,880
  Come on! Let's get out of this.

246
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,280
  I want to do another!

247
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,520
  Come on.

248
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,880
Is this what you want? 
 Staying here and go to parties?

249
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,440
  But I like parties! 
 Oh, Clarissa!

250
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,360
  You always tie me up
with your queen standard, Breitl.

251
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,400
  It's my turn to shuffle, 
 Herbert.

252
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,280
  Hugh, do you  
ever stop eating?

253
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,320
  Did you know 
Wingate's married again?

254
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,160
  Yes, they came to call 
last week.

255
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,240
  The woman use to be his housemaid.

256
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,920
He had a nerve. 
 Bringing a housemaid to Cork.

257
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,000
 Yes! She was absurdly overdressed. 
She looked like a cockatoo.

258
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
  And she never stopped talking!

259
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,080
  She probably thought 
you all knew.

260
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,080
 Knew what?

261
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,000
  That she had a baby
 before she was married.

262
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,840
  - I don't think I should ever be up to speak to her again! 
 - Don't be ridiculous, Clarissa.

263
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,800
  If this is true we should certainly
 not receive her again.

264
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,480
  I should think not. If we start receiving 
  women like that, you don't know where it'll end?

265
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,640
  Oh, you snob! You represent all that's 
 detestable in british middle class life.

266
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,080
  It's men like you who's responsible 
 for prostitutes around Piccadilly.

267
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,280
  Me! 
 Yes, men like you.

268
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,720
  That's enough, Sally. We'll have no more  
 of this conversation.

269
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,920
  I'm glad I walked out. They're all 
 such snobs and Hugh is a fraud.

270
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,120
  Clarissa is so prudish 
 and arrogant.

271
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,280
  Not really.

272
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,800
 It's just what she's been brought up to. 
 Wish she would see things more clearly.

273
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,560
  Clearly enough to marry you, 
you mean?

274
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,440
  I see.

275
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,880
  This is Mr. Wickham, Peter. 
 My name is Dalloway.

276
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,360
  Richard Dalloway.

277
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,360
  But I've introduced you
to everyone as Mr. Wickham.

278
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,120
 Still Dalloway. 
 My name is Dalloway.

279
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,360
  Dalloway.

280
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,520
 So definitly you're going
to go to politics?

281
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,200
  Yes, I think so. 
 What is with your friend, Mr. ..?

282
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,360
  "My name is Dalloway".

283
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,760
  What's the matter?

284
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,880
  Somebody's just walking 
 on my grave.

285
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,120
  I took another friend. 
 She's gonna marry that man!

286
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,240
  I went into the sea.

287
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,800
  I have been dead.

288
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
  But now I'm alive.

289
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,760
  I must rest, I must rest.

290
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,680
  Septimus, I'm going to ask 
 someone the time.

291
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,680
  I think we have to go now.

292
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,680
  It's nowhere to go, 
nowhere to hide.

293
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,720
  Septimus, you know we are going to see 
 a doctor who will help you.

294
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,320
  No more doctors!

295
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,720
  No more lies! 
 Septimus, please!

296
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,680
  Irvin!

297
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,400
  Thank you.

298
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,040
  Evans?

299
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,560
  Evans!

300
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,720
  For God's sake, don't come!

301
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,000
  Septimus, it isn't Evans, allright? 
 It isn't Evans.

302
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,360
  There is nothing to worry about. 
 The man is not Evans.

303
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,880
Really, he isn't.

304
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,480
  Come on.

305
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,560
  Let's go for a walk.

306
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,360
  Clarissa! It's such a lovely evening. 
 Let's go to the lake.

307
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
  Yes! We can go boating.

308
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,120
  Let's get our shoulds. 
 It might be cold.

309
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,840
  Peter! We're going boating
 on the lake. Aren't you coming?

310
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,680
  I think Mr. Dalloway 
 likes you.

311
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,200
Oh, aren't we being 
 the perfect hostess?

312
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,480
Oh, don't come than if you're going 
to be beastly in the wood.

313
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,920
  "Dalloway. It's still Dalloway."

314
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,720
  Come on.

315
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
  They're all waiting.

316
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,680
  Poor old woman.

317
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,320
  Septimus, you won't tell 
 the doctor, will you?

318
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,920
  You mustn't. 
 They will take you away from me.

319
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,600
  Sir William BRADSHAW 
 M.D.

320
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,520
 I've looked at Dr. Holmes's notes. 
 He's been seeing your husband for some six weeks?

321
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,600
  Yes. 
 He is our landlady's doctor.

322
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,480
  She send for him because 
 I told her I was worried about Septimus.

323
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,760
  He threatened to kill himself? 
 He didn't mean it.

324
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
  No. Of course not.

325
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,320
  And Dr. Holmes prescribed ...

326
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,360
  bromine? 
 Yes

327
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
 He said that there was nothing really wrong. 


328
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,480

But Septimus keeps talking to the dead man, Evans, 
his friend who was killed in the war. 


329
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,800
 And Septimus wasn't like this
 when I met him.

330
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,120
 It's happened in just the last few months.

331
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,920
  He says people are talking 
 behind bedroom walls...

332
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,480
  and he saw a woman's head
 in the middle of a fern.

333
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,720
  He says he's on trial  
 for some terrible crime ...

334
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,240
  but, of course, he's done nothing.

335
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,200
 And then he seems to forget 
it all and seems happy again, as he used to be.

336
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,120
  We went to Hampton Court, 
on top of a bus, the other day...

337
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,480
  and told of red and yellow flowers. He said 
they looked like floating lamps.

338
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,120
 And he was fun, as he used to be  
 and made me laugh. I was so happy.

339
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,080
  And suddenly, as we  
 were standing by the river, he said ...

340
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,800
  "We will kill ourselves." 
 Then, he held my hand ...

341
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,440
  and said he was falling
 into the flames. And he cried and cried.

342
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,160
  Ms. Warrensmith, your husband is  
 very seriously ill.

343
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,240
  From everything you told me  
 and from Dr. Holmes's report ...

344
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,240
  I believe that his suffering
from delayed shell shock.

345
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,640
  But he's not mad, is he?

346
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,720
  I never use that word. 
 I prefer to say ...

347
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
lacking the sense of proportion.

348
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,560
  But Dr. Holmes said that there
  was nothing what so ever the matter!

349
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,600
  Your husband needs rest. 
Complete rest.

350
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,040
But not away from me!

351
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,960
  My dear Ms. Warrensmith sometimes 
we have to separate such people...

352
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,080
from their loved ones, 
for their own good.

353
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,280
  Dalloway! I met Clarissa 
 this morning.

354
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,880
So, she's giving another of her 
famous parties tonight?

355
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,280
  Right as usual, Hugh.

356
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,680
  And Lady Bruton summond you as well. 
 Wonder what she wants from us?

357
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,120
  Nothing we can't accomplish 
 ever at a good lunch, I'm sure.

358
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,560
  Ah, good day, Miss Brasher. 
 Good day, sir.

359
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,000
  How's your brother, 
 in South Africa?

360
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,920
 I got you here under false pretenses. 
I actually need your help.

361
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,720
  But we'll have lunch first.

362
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,400
  And how is Clarissa?

363
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Quite well recovered, thank you. 
 The doctor told her he must take things easy ...

364
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,960
  But she does so want to
give her party tonight.

365
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,520
  I trust we'll should have the pleasure 
 of your company tonight.

366
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,920
  Of course, Richard. I wouldn't miss 
 one of your parties.

367
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,160
  I met Clarissa in the park 
 this morning.

368
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,480
  She was wearing  
a yellow feathered hat.

369
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,200
  Oh, yes! I like that hat.

370
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,320
 We'll you come in now, please?

371
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,600
  Good.

372
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,840
  Do sit down.

373
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,360
  I see that you served with great distinction 
in the war, Mr. Warrensmith.

374
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,000
  At the war?

375
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,400
  The European war.

376
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,320
  A little shindy of schoolboys 
 with gunpowder.

377
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,960
  Did I serve with distinction? 
 I'd forgotten.

378
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,480
  In the war, itself, I failed.

379
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,720
  No, he served with the greatest distinction. 
 He was promoted.

380
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,720
  I. ..

381
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,760
  I have committed a crime. 
 He's done nothing wrong whatever.

382
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,720
  What did Dr. Holmes advised 
you to do?

383
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,400
 To my wife he said
to make me porridge.

384
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,960
  Headache, dreams, 
 fears are just nerves.

385
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,440
  Health is largely a  
matter of our control.

386
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,760
  I should take up some hobby.

387
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,080
  Dr. Holmes ...

388
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,240
 throws himself into outside interests. 
 And throwing himself, he is able ...

389
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,000
  to switch off from his patients  
 on to old furniture.

390
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,560
  Dr. Holmes is interested 
 in antique furniture.

391
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,080
  Yes

392
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,080
 So, when the damn fool came again, 
 I refused to see him.

393
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,720
  Impulsive brute...

394
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,520
 Blood red nostrils...

395
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,880
  Once you stumble, human nature 
 is on you. Holmes is on you.

396
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,360
  Our only chance is to escape 
 without letting Holmes know.

397
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,400
  Anywhere, 
 away from Dr. Holmes.

398
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,680
  There is no excuse. 
Nothing whatever is the matter.

399
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,840
  Except sin.

400
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,280
  For which ...

401
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,680
  human nature has condemned me 
to death.

402
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,600
  I can not feel.

403
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,160
  I did not care, 
 when  Evans was killed.

404
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,400
  That was the worst ...

405
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,520
  but all the other crimes ...

406
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,840
  raised their heads, 
 shaked their fingers ...

407
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,360
  and they cheer and they sneer.

408
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,720
  And the verdict of human nature 
 on such a beast ...

409
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,040
  is death!

410
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,560
  We all have our moments 
 of depression.

411
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,280
 He has impulses, sometimes? 
 That is my own affair!

412
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,360
  There you are mistaken, sir. We are all 
responsible one for another.

413
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,360
  I am responsible 
 to Dr. Holmes?

414
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,760
  Another humbug.

415
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,000
  We ...

416
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,120
have been arranging
that you should go into a home.

417
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,960
One of Holmes's homes?

418
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,480
  No, one of my homes, 
 Mr. Warrensmith.

419
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,800
  And there we will teach you to rest 
and to regain a sense of proportion.

420
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,400
  But I've confessed! 
I confessed my crimes!

421
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,160
  Why won't you had me off? 
 He's done nothing. Nothing!

422
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,360
 He will be perfectly looked after. 
 I will visit once a week.

423
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,200
  But my husband does not like 
 doctors. He will refuse to go.

424
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:31,880
 Your husband has threatened to kill himself. 
There is no alternative, it is a question of the law.

425
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,280
 It's a very beautiful home in the country. 
 Nurses are admirable.

426
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,840
Now, if you have no further questions to ask...

427
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,200
I will arrange everything with Dr. Holmes.

428
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,320
He will send somebody around this evening ...

429
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,400
  between five and six.

430
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,560
 It's the law, Ms. Warrensmith, 
 and it is for the best.

431
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,920
 It won't be Dr. Holmes who comes, will it?

432
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,040
 Trust everything to me.

433
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,280
I do not like that man. 
 He's a humbug.

434
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,600
We are deserted.

435
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,120
  Do you know who's in town?
 Our old friend, Peter Walsh.

436
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,720
Back from India. 
 Peter Walsh back?

437
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,000
  In trouble with some woman, 
evidently.

438
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,080
  Some woman in India.

439
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,200
  Peter Walsh was always in trouble 
 of some sort.

440
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,440
Didn't he marry someone on the boat
going out?

441
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,560
  I don't believe that lasted long. 
 I imagine that was all what...

442
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,840
  I believe is known as "the rebound".

443
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,040
  I suppose he'll try 
to settle here now.

444
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,760
  I'd say it will be difficult to help him. 
He'll be quite a misfit.

445
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,840
 I'm sure Clarissa will know 
that he's here.

446
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,800
  And I no doubt he'll be at her the party 
tonight and all will be revealed.

447
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,120
  Yes, if Peter Walsh is in town, 
 Clarissa will know.

448
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,960
  This is better.

449
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,320
  Come on, Peter.

450
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,200
  We'll race you
 to the top.

451
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,600
  Well ..

452
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,920
  my idea is this.

453
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,760
  We all agree, do we not,
 that Britain is overpopulated.

454
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,240
  Yes, indeed.

455
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,880
  And you agree ...

456
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,160
  that many of these men, 
 back from the war ...

457
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,720
  are finding it difficult
 to find employment.

458
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,200
Indeed, in some cases, 
their work ...

459
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,600
  has been commandered by women. 
 However ...

460
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,120
 We all know the rot
 that's set in there.

461
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,920
  Unfortunately! 
 Well ..

462
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,920
  my idea is a simple one.

463
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,760
  All the best ideas are simple, 
as we know.

464
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,760
  My project is to incourage ...

465
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,160
 by making it financialy easy 
 young people of both sexes ...

466
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,680
  to emigrate to Canada.

467
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,120
They will be set up with the fair chance 
of doing well in Canada.

468
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:46,880
  And Britain will gain financialy, 
in the long run.

469
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,760
It's only so much that I can do, 
being a woman.

470
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,840
  But Richard, I ask you ...

471
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,800
 to make this suggestion 
 in the House. And Hugh ...

472
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,960
  I want you to help me start the ball rolling 
with a letter to the Times.

473
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,960
  I know, my dear Hugh, 
 that you will know, exactly ...

474
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,400
  how to phrase it for me.

475
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,320
  I think someone is already typing
a motion against some kind of emigration plan going.

476
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,320
  But I suppose a letter to the Times 
 will do no harm.

477
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,200
  I take it further. 
Make emigration obligatory ...

478
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,320
  if you couldn't get work 
after a certain period of time.

479
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,400
  I wouldn't go that far. 
 These things are never quite that simple.

480
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,120
  There is a new chef at the Cafe Royal ...

481
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,920
  does marvellous things 
with mollusces.

482
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,600
  You'll just have time 
 to catch the three o'clock post, Mildred.

483
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,400
  I think we can say if you say it, 
that was a job well done.

484
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,520
  I should take my rest now.

485
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,440
  Go!

486
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,480
  I wonder if Peter Walsh has
got in touch with Clarissa?

487
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,160
  I think I might buy 
 something for Evelyn. She is very low.

488
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,720
  And jewelry never 
loses its price.

489
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,560
I think I buy Clarissa 
some flowers.

490
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,040
  Yes, I'll pop in to see her on my way 
 back to the House with some flowers.

491
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,640
  Fresh flowers!

492
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,600
I wanted them to be red.

493
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,600
  I know. 
They're the red ones left.

494
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,840
  Richard!

495
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,640
  Red roses!

496
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,360
  I put them somewhere 
 very special.

497
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,160
  How was lunch? Amusing?

498
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,920
  Hugh was there. 
 He's "rely" is getting quite intolerable.

499
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,800
  She wants him to write 
 a letter to The Times.

500
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:05,320
  One of her schemes 
 to put in the world in order.

501
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,080
  What's all this?

502
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,680
  Richard, you couldn't have forgotten! 
 It's for my party!

503
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,040
And now, it will all be spoiled.

504
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,200
  Come here.

505
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,640
  Let's sit down for five minutes.

506
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,240
  Why would it all be spoiled?

507
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,280
  Ms. Marsham has just  
sent me this note to say ...

508
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,040
 that she's quite sure 
 I wouldn't mind ...

509
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,680
 she's invited Ellie Henderson. 
 What's so dreadful about that?

510
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,120
  Richard! She's one of the dullest 
women in the world.

511
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,960
She'll bore everyone. And than Elizabeth said 
she isn't coming to the party tonight.

512
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,040
  She's gone off to pray 
 with that dreadful Mrs. Kilman.

513
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,080
  You worry too much 
about your parties, Clarissa.

514
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,560
  Richard, it's all that I can do.

515
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,800
  Give people one night 
 in which everything seems enchanted ...

516
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,600
 when all the women seem beautiful, 
 all the men are handsome ...

517
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,440
  and everyone's made to feel
 they're amusing ...

518
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,880
  Yes, liked.

519
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,800
  And go home thinking: 
 "Ah, what fun it was!"

520
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,000
  "What a wonderful evening!" 
 "How good it is to be alive!"

521
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,440
  I don't think poor old Ellie Henderson 
 could put a stop to that.

522
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,440
  You're laughing at me. 
Not in the least.

523
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,680
  Richard! 
 You're so much nicer than I am.

524
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,480
  You should never have 
  married me.

525
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,280
 Then what would you've done? 
 Married Peter Walsh, I suppose.

526
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,840
 Would you believe that
he was here this morning?

527
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,080
  Yes, Minnie Bruton 
tell me he was in town.

528
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,840
 He's in love with some
 woman in India.

529
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,800
  He's here to see about 
the divorce.

530
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,800
  He's just the same. 
 He hasn't changed the slightest.

531
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,080
  You choose a cake, sir. 
 Thank you.

532
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,040
  Did you understand what 
 the Reverend was saying this morning ...

533
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,240
 about knowidge 
 coming out from suffering?

534
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,040
  Not really, no. 
But than ...

535
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,840
  I suppose I haven't really suffered 
 yet.

536
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,520
  Maybe you'll never will.

537
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,920
  Not that I wish that one.

538
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,240
  But as he says, real 
 knowledge is only gained thru suffering.

539
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,480
  What was you wanted to buy here?

540
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,000
A petticoat. Mine is in shreds, 
 I hung on to it as long as I could.

541
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,480
 They have some pretty striped ones.

542
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,240
  I couldn't possibly afford the striped ones.

543
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,920
   I might have to go to the party tonight.

544
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,960
  I've forgotten all about it when I 
said I'll help with the mission.

545
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,440
  Mommy will be upset 
 if I don't go.

546
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,320
  It's a great pity that women like your mother 
 have nothing better to do ...

547
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,560
  with their time than get parties.

548
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,080
  Oh, I know it's not her fault.

549
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,640
  Women like your mother can't help it 
if they'll been spoiled.

550
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,320
 She likes giving parties. 
I never go to parties.

551
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,080
  Why should they ask me? 
 I'm plain ...

552
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,240
  I'm unhappy. But I don't pity 
 myself. I pity other people more.

553
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,240
  Your bill, madam.

554
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,840
  You finish your tea. 
 I pay to set the desk.

555
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,680
I'll help another night at the mission. 
I'm sorry. I have to go.

556
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,760
  Fear not.

557
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,760
   Fear no more.

558
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,280
  Who you making that hat for? 
 Mrs. Filmore's married daughter.

559
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,320
 And what's the name of Mrs. Filmore's 
married daughter? Mrs. Peters.

560
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,520
 I don't like it, but Mrs. Filmore 
 has been so good to us.

561
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,480
  That's too small for Mrs. Peters. 
 She's enormous.

562
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,800
  That's an organ grinding 
 monkey's hat.

563
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,800
  There.

564
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,520
  Now, the poor woman looks
 like a pig at the fair.

565
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,200
  Come on, let's see what else you
have in your workbox.

566
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,640
  She shall have a beautiful hat.

567
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,560
  There. Now, stitch that together 
 very, very carefully.

568
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,960
  Evans?

569
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,880
  Mrs. Filmore, I shall be to busy 
looking after Septimus.

570
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,760
  It will take a long time. 
 We thank you for the paper.

571
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,040
  Evans?

572
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,040
  It was only the evening paper. 
 Mrs Filmore with the evening paper.

573
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,640
  They going to take me away, Rezia.

574
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,480
  Sir William Bradshaw said that
 you must learn to rest.

575
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,760
  It's "must". "Must".

576
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:50,440
  Why "must"? What right has he  
 to say "must" to me?

577
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,760
  It is because you talk 
 of killing yourself.

578
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,200
  So ...

579
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,200
  I'm in their power.

580
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,680
  Where are my writings, Rezia?

581
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,000
  Burn them! 
 Some are very beautiful!

582
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,000
  I'm going with you, Septimus. They can't 
 separate us against our will.

583
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,720
  You're a flowering tree.

584
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,240
  You're a sanctuary.

585
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,080
You fear no more!

586
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,360
  Not Holmes, not Bradshaw.

587
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,400
  You've triumphed.

588
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,120
  I'm going to pack our things, 
 Septimus.

589
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,240
  I shall tie this with silk 
 and hide them away.

590
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,920
  Good afternoon, Mrs. Filmore. 
 Good afternoon, dr.

591
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,840
  They send Holmes. 
 I won't let him come in here.

592
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,880
  Ms. Warrensmith, Sir William Bradshaw 
 is a physician of up most integrity.

593
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,280
  He promised not to send you. 
 Is your husband upstairs?

594
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,800
  Look! I will not allow. 
 It is the law.

595
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,320
  Please, go away. 
 I can not allow you.

596
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,840
  Leave my husband alone, 
 I beg you.

597
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,280
  Mr. Warrensmith!

598
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,680
You want my life?

599
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,480
  I'll give it to you.

600
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,920
  God 
 God!

601
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,760
  Why the devil did he do it?

602
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,480
  One of the triumphs 
 of modern civilization.

603
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,160
  Good afternoon.

604
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,400
I'm 12, please.

605
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,160
  Thank you. 
 This came for you, Mr. Walsh.

606
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,880
  Thank you.

607
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,600
  Thank you.

608
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,120
  " Peter, it was heavenly to see you, 
 I must tell you that. Clarissa. "

609
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,520
  We could play tennis.

610
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,080
  No. It's too hot 
 and scorchy for tennis.

611
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,720
Beside, 
we need a fourth person to play doubles.

612
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,600
  Hugh's gone to visit his mother. 
And Herbert won't play.

613
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,680
  Maybe "My name is Dalloway" will turn up.

614
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,000
  In his perfect whites  
 matching his perfect teeth.

615
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,960
  "My name is Dalloway".

616
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,760
I think we've had enough of 
that feeble joke.

617
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,640
  She can't be  
 serious about him!

618
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,800
  I'm gonna have this out.

619
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,200
 You've come to an understanding 
 with Dalloway, haven't you?

620
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,520
Haven't you?

621
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,840
  It's so difficult, Peter.

622
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,400
  Just tell me the truth.

623
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,200
  Tell me the truth.

624
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,080
  Tell me the truth!

625
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,680
  He makes me feel safe. 
 Safe? Is that what you want?

626
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,320
  You want so much of me, Peter. 
 I just can't do it!

627
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,880
  Throw everything away
and go across the world with you.

628
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,400
  I'm just not brave in that way. 
 And Richard ...

629
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,720
  and Richard will pamper you

630
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,480
  and keep you in a perfectly 
  beautiful safe prison...

631
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,920
  filled with flowers and stuffed 
 with elegant antique furniture.

632
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,800
 He'll make all the decisions for you 
 and you'll  never have to think again.

633
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,880
  You demand so much from me! 
 Because I love you, for God's sake!

634
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,960
  Richard will leave me room,
room to breath.

635
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:31,600
  Clarissa, he is a fool!

636
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,040
  And unimaginative, 
 dull fool!

637
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,600
  You want to much of me, Peter. 
 I can't give it.

638
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,080
So, it's no use.

639
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,520
  This is the end.

640
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,920
  I'm sorry, Peter. 
 Clarissa!

641
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,000
  Clarissa! Clarissa!

642
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,480
  Lord Lexham. 
 Lord Lexham.

643
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,320
  How delightful to see you.

644
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,320
  I'm so sorry, but my dear wife 
has a cold.

645
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,320
 Oh, dear!

646
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,880
  She simply would not wear her furs to
 the garden party at Buckhurst.

647
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,360
  And it was bitterly cold. 
 Richard!

648
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,560
  Oh, dear! It's going to be a failure. 
 A complete failure.

649
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,720
  How delightful of you to come. 
Lovely to see you.

650
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,280
 We're delighted to see you. 
 I'm glad you could come.

651
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,320
  Why do I do it?

652
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,880
How lovely of you to come. 
 It was nice of you to invite me.

653
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,320
 Mr. Peter Walsh.

654
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:19,080
  Peter, you came! 
 How delightful to see you.

655
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,680
  Peter! Back from India, right?

656
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,760
  Yes, back from India. 
Must be years since we've seen you.

657
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,800
It was a mistake to invite him. 
 You'll all know

658
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,280
 when he's sorry to come.

659
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,560
  And he's criticizing me. 
 I know he is.

660
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:39,680
  Accusing me of being insincere. 
 Why do I do this things?

661
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:43,760
  Why seek pinnacles 
 and stand drenched in fire?

662
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,320
  I feel burned to a cinder.

663
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,480
  Miss Henderson.

664
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:54,000
  Better that...than 
to brindle away like Ellie Henderson.

665
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:58,560
  Ellie! I'm so glad you've come. 
 It's so grand!

666
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,120
  Oh, dear! Why can she at least 
stand up properly!

667
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,280
  Well, well, I suppose 
 it's her weaponless state.

668
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,120
 Wonderful to see you again.

669
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,960
  Richard, how lovely.

670
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,800
  Their graces, the Duke 
 and Duchess of Marlborough.

671
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,960
  A duke?

672
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,400
  Oh, why did the Marlboroughs 
 have to follow Ellie Henderson?

673
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,000
  They must wonder what kind 
of people I invite to our parties.

674
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,480
  Clarissa, how lovely to see you. 
 Thank you so much for inviting us.

675
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,800
  Bertie, how lovely of you to come.

676
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:37,320
  It's a disaster! The party is 
 a disaster! I'm humiliated!

677
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,040
  And now there's Peter wondering off. 
 I'm speak to him!

678
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,240
  I know I get the chance, I know it. 
Why's he like dirt? He thinks I'm absurd.

679
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:54,280
 Oh, it's too much of an effort! 
 I'm not enjoying it at all.

680
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:59,320
  I feel like a stake 
 driven in on the top of this stairs.

681
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,680
  Clarissa. 
 Delighted to see you.

682
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,760
  Mr. Hugh Whitbread. 
How did you find Evelyn today?

683
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,760
  Bearing up, bearing up. 
 I shall visit her tomorrow.

684
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,400
  I do hope she doesn't read 
  Lady Azquez's memories.

685
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,160
 Oh, I doubt it. 
 Not Evelyn, she's not a great reader.

686
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,360
  Lady Bruton. 
 Lady Bruton? So she came...

687
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,320
  My dear Clarissa.

688
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:26,280
  Maybe she doesn't dislike me as much 
as I thought she did.

689
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,720
  The essential condition 
 for a study of Milton ...

690
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,320
  an  in depth study of Milton ...

691
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,280
  A momentary sensation 
 of an embrace!

692
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:45,320
  It's not a failure, after all! 
 It's going to be allright.

693
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,320
  It's still touch and go, 
 but it's begun. My party has begun!

694
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,480
  Lady Rosseter. 
 Lady Rosseter? Who I ask can that be?

695
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,120
  Clarissa!

696
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,160
  Sally 
 That voice!

697
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,080
  Sally Seaton.

698
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,600
  Goodness! She didn't look like that 
 when she kissed me by the fountain.

699
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:17,640
  How wonderful to see you! 
 How extraordinary to see her again!

700
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,320
  She's older, she's happier, 
 but less lovely.

701
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,880
  But, oh, how wonderful that
 she's come to my party.

702
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:32,360
  Sally, I've been thinking about  
 Bordon all day.

703
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,120
  Have you? Have you?

704
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,960
  The Prime Minister.

705
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,960
Oh, my goodness, Sally, I must go. 
 Where's Richard?

706
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,600
  Sorry, Ellie. 
 Duty calls.

707
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,520
  How delightful to see you.

708
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,120
  Unfortunately, my 
 wife could not come.

709
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,200
  The Prime Minister!

710
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,280
 It is the Prime Minister.

711
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,440
  Clarissa is looking well, 
considering how ill she's been.

712
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,400
 I know that Richard was very 
 worried about her.

713
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,000
  M.P.'s wives 
really shouldn't get ill.

714
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,960
  I believe it was her heart.

715
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,680
  I think you can always pull yourself together. 
 Mind of a matter.

716
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:43,240
  Harry Audle. 
You painted your wife. Lovely picture.

717
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,040
  Peter!

718
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,240
  Peter Walsh!

719
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:01,080
  Good Lord! Sally Seaton. 
 Lady Rosseter now.

720
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,560
  Don't be absurd. 
 It's true. Lady Rosseter.

721
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,960
  We live in Manchester 
and I have five ennormous boys.

722
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,080
  Either my eyes are deceiving me, 
 or that's Ellie Henderson?

723
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,960
  It's our old vicar's daughter. 
 She's gaping at the Prime Minister.

724
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,800
  Oh, do bring her over, 
 before she disgraces herself ...

725
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,320
  and faints with astonishment.

726
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,200
  Mr. Prime Minister, how nice to see you. 
 What would you like?

727
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,160
  She's always looked delicate to me. 
 But such charm.

728
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,600
  Richard would've done a great deal better, 
if he'd married a woman ...

729
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,920
   with less charm and more backbone. 
 It would've helped him in his work.

730
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,160
  He's lost his chance in the Cabinet.

731
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,120
  Lady Bruton and Lady Beckford.

732
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,560
  What a pleasure to see you.

733
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,320
  Lord, what snobbs the english are!

734
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,200
 How they love dressing up 
 and doing homage. Listen to them!

735
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,520
  I'd better have baboons chattering
 and coolies beat their wives.

736
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,640
Still the same old Peter. 
 Still playing with your pocket knife.

737
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,880
  It is delicious, isn't it?

738
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,920
  We are not all the same, Peter. 
 My husband may have his own cotton mill now,

739
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,800
  but he was a miner's son
 and when he...

740
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,720
 Oh, look! Look! 
 Isn't that Hugh Whitbread?

741
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:38,520
 What a toady! 
 What an obsequious toady!

742
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,040
  He's not changed at all.

743
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,400
  How can she bear him?

744
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,320
  It still makes you angry!

745
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,160
  Look at her. Intoxicated, 
while they all're thinking she's brilliant.

746
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,800
  Don't be too hard on her. 
 After all, parties are a kind of performance.

747
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,040
  She has to give a performance. 
 It isn't the real Clarissa.

748
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:06,360
  The real Clarissa was lost 
 years ago.

749
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,400
  Mr. Prime Minister, can I 
 introduce our daughter.

750
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,160
  I'm sure, if you were alone 
 with her, you'll find the old Clarissa again.

751
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,840
  Fat chance of that this evening!

752
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,960
  Richard so enjoyed your lunch and party.

753
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,040
  Richard was most encouraging. 
 And he's promised to drop my little idea ...

754
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,360
  into the right ear.

755
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:30,920
  He and the Prime Minister 
 are having a quiet word now before he leaves.

756
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,240
  My plan will save  
 the government a fortune.

757
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,360
  Maybe Richard is sowing  
 the seeds this very minute.

758
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,120
  Isn't that Peter Walsh 
 talking to old Mrs. Perry?

759
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,280
  Yes, that's Peter.

760
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,480
  Dear Peter. 
 So very sharp and clever...

761
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,800
  sure had made a name for himself. But 
 he's allways in some trouble with women.

762
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,200
  Do come and say hello to him!

763
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,680
  Now, Peter, we can get it straight
 from the horse's mouth.

764
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,800
  What is going on in India?

765
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,600
 Well, great deal, Lady Bruton. 
 Is a very complex issue.

766
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,120
  It is a tragedy.

767
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,680
  If my father, the general, 
 would be alive, he'll sort it out.

768
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,960
  Hay, Mrs. Perry.

769
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,880
  Clarissa, I must speak with you, please ...

770
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,360
  Peter, I must go and deal  
with Sir William and Lady Bradshaw.

771
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,600
  Will talk later. 
 I promise.

772
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,840
 Awfully good of you to come.

773
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,720
  We are shockingly late. 
 We hardly dared to come in.

774
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,720
  We couldn't resist the temptation.

775
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,320
  But a rather sad occurrence held us up. 
 A young patient of mine killed himself.

776
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,400
  Really, Richard, there must be 
 some provision ...

777
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,400
  in the government's bill for 
this cases of delayed shell shock.

778
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,840
  Yes, poor young man. 
Awarded for bravery during the war.

779
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,280
  And than this evening he just throws himself
 out of the window. Impaled on the railings.

780
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,800
  It's quite upset William.

781
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,840
  She looks like a sea lion 
 barking at me.

782
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:08,760
  Dear William. He does so hate 
 losing a patient.

783
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,800
  When a young man's body is blown appart, 
 he loses an arm or a leg ...

784
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,400
  or half of face, 
 as we've seen so often it.

785
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,440
  It's immediate.

786
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:20,480
  Stop it! Stop it! Don't talk of death 
 in the middle of my party!

787
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,280
 I don't like you. 
 I've never liked you.

788
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,960
  You're obscurely evil.

789
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,960
 And the poor creature will either survive or he won't,
  but we all know ...

790
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
 and we do our best for him.

791
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,280
  A young man came to you 
on the edge of  insanity...

792
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,640
  and you forced his soul ...

793
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:40,120
 made his life intolerable 
 and he killed himself.

794
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,520
 Stucked there with lobs... It's frightful... 
 Every single mother does everything ...

795
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,200
  If you'll excuse me, 
 lady Bradshaw ...

796
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,600
  I have to ... 
 Alice!

797
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,080
  The problem is that politicians 
 are not really ...

798
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,920
 very interested in shell shock. 
This is it. This is exactly it.

799
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,400
  Hello, Henry, Eleonore. 
 Delightful to see you.

800
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,480
  I see that sir William Bradshaw 
 is just arrived.

801
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,920
I think it would be most useful to bring him in 
 on your emigration scheme.

802
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,480
  I know he's treating many of this fellows
 from shell shock or whatever.

803
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,960
  I'm sure, he'll think it's a good idea 
to get some of them to Canada.

804
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,400
  Open air life and all that... 
excellent for mental disturbance.

805
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,200
  What a good idea, Hugh.

806
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,040
  She's disappeared.

807
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,640
  Do you think she went upstairs? 
She can't have gone to bed, can't she?

808
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,960
  No. She couldn't leave 
 her own party.

809
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,440
 I don't know. I don't know.
 I didn't know she'd been ill.

810
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,480
  Stop worrying, Peter.

811
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:29,440
 He threw himself out of the window 
 and impaled himself on the railings.

812
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:32,800
 Up flashed the ground 
 and through him ...

813
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,760
  blundering and bruising 
 went the rusty spikes ...

814
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,480
  and there he lay with a tut... tut! tut!
in his brain.

815
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,120
  and then 
 a suffocation of blackness.

816
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,960
  Why? Why did he do it?

817
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:51,400
  Why did the Bradshaws talked 
 of it at my party?

818
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,640
  He's thrown it all away. His life. 
 Just like that.

819
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,760
  I once throw a shelling 
 into the serpentine.

820
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,520
  But his thrown his life away.

821
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,400
  You were going to write, 
 I remember.

822
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,280
 Have you written anything?

823
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,200
  Not a word.

824
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,800
  Not a solitary word.

825
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,600
  But then he will
 always stay young.

826
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:37,560
 All day long I've been thinking 
of Bordon, of Peter and Sally.

827
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,280
  We've grown old.

828
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,000
  We'll grow older.

829
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,160
  Have I lost the thing
 that mattered?

830
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:02,720
  Let it get obscured, 
 gradually...

831
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:08,280
  every day in corruption, 
 lies and chatter?

832
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,800
  Do you remember the night 
 we went boating on the lake?

833
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,120
  Yes, I remember thinking: 
 "She's abandoned me."

834
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:33,200
  And then, all of the sudden, she was there, 
with her hand stretched out ...

835
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,520
looking utterly beautiful, saying: 
 "Come on, come on.

836
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,800
  They're all waiting. "

837
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,520
  Why wouldn't she marry me, 
 Sally?

838
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,320
  She was afraid.

839
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,320
  Your parents just handed to you, 
 LIFE...

840
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,720
  to be lived right through to the end.

841
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,520
 We must walk it 
serenely.

842
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,480
  But in the depths of my heart, 
 there's been an awful fear ...

843
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,440
sometimes that 
 I couldn't go on ...

844
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,320
  without Richard, sitting there
calmly reading the Times ...

845
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:22,920
  while I crouched like a bird
and gradually revived.

846
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,880
  I might have perished.

847
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,720
  I looked across the room 
 and wondered - "Who's that lovely girl?"

848
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,640
  And then I realized: 
 "That's my daughter."

849
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,400
  Maybe she needed someone
 who found life simple.

850
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,640
  She certainly cared for you, 
 more than she cared for Richard.

851
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,960
  Oh, my life isn't simple.

852
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,160
  My relationship with her
 wasn't simple.

853
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,080
  She broke my heart.

854
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,080
  And you can't love like that 
 twice.

855
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,840
  What makes us go on?

856
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,640
  What sends roaring 
 up in us ...

857
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,840
  that immeasurable delight
 to surprise us?

858
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,600
Than nothing can be 
slow enough...

859
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,720
  nothing lasts to long.

860
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,480
 You want to say to each moment: 
 "Stay!" "Stay!"

861
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,320
  "Stay!"

862
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,040
I cherrish the friendship
 I had with Clarissa.

863
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,960
 There was something pure about her.

864
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:57,600
  She had such charm, 
 such generosity.

865
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,560
  I can see her to this day, going 
 bye the house all in white.

866
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:06,560
She always seemed to be in white 
and her arms were full of flowers.

867
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,640
  And I wondered ...

868
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,840
  does absence really matter?

869
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,080
  Does distance?

870
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,880
  You'll think me sentimental 
 and so I am ...

871
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:24,920
  but I've come to believe that the only 
 thing worth saying is what you really feel.

872
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,080
 But I don't know what I feel.

873
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,400
  I know that I loved her once 
 and that it stayed with me all my life ...

874
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,600
  and colored everything.

875
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,400
  I must go back to my party. 
To Sally and Peter.

876
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,520
  That young man killed himself, 
 but I don't pity him.

877
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,560
  I'm somehow glad he could do it, 
throw it away.

878
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,960
 It's made me feel the beauty, 
 somehow feel ...

879
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,440
very like him, less afraid.

880
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,720
  I have to go.

881
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,440
  Do you think he's made her happy? 
 Who can tell, Peter?

882
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,240
  All our relationships are 
 just scratches on the surface.

883
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,560
  We tought he wasn't 
 very bright.

884
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,120
  But what does the brain matter?

885
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,480
  Compared to the heart.

886
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,040
  There you are.

887
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,320
  Peter and Sally haven't left, have they? 
 Don't know.

888
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,600
  Clarissa!

889
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,360
  I couldn't leave without 
saying goodbye.

890
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,080
And you can't leave, 
 until you danced with me.

891
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,880
  Peter's in the library.

892
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,840
  Here I am, at last.

893
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
