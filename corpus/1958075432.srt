00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,066
but I couldn't budge it,
and I'm a lot stronger than I look.

171
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,011
I do weight training. Not to
bulk up. Hector would hate that.

172
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,378
Actually, I'd hate that, too. I don't
think it's attractive on a woman,

173
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,575
all those muscles.

174
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,618
Oh, I'm talking too much,
aren't 1?

175
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,278
(STAMMERING) It's
because I'm so nervous.

176
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,686
I've never done this
sort of thing before.

177
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,191
You probably don't think so
because you do it all the time,

178
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,455
but from my side,
it's very scary.

179
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,587
Oh, it's a good idea
having a kitchen.

180
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,155
That way, you don't have to go
out to lunch, maybe miss a client.

181
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,927
You could offer someone
a cup of coffee.

182
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,469
Oh, would you care... Oh,
not for me, thank you.

183
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,368
I try to limit my caffeine.

184
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,837
Probably a good idea.

185
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,466
But... But I keep it at home.
I offer it to my friends.

186
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,375
I'm no fanatic.
You know, this is...

187
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:42,313
This is really nice. It's very warm,
very comfortable.

188
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,943
It's not like an office at all. It
feels more like somebody's home.

189
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,647
It is somebody's home.
Mine.

190
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,383
Oh, my God.
You're not James Rockford?

191
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:55,292
Oh, I wrote down the wrong
address. I'm really sorry.

192
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,295
I don't know what to say,
I... Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

193
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,162
It's okay, it's okay.
It's the right address.

194
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,793
I'm Jim Rockford,
and this is my office and my home.

195
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,769
Oh. Now,
why don't you come right over here?

196
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,172
(CHUCKLES) You sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

197
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,868
Tell me what
I can do for you.

198
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,573
Randy said you were
easy to talk to.

199
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,808
He said he felt like
he'd known you for years.

200
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:16,906
Randy?

201
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,178
Randolph Silvero.

202
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,049
Silvero Micro-CompuMeg.

203
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,316
He's a family friend. He
told us what you did for him.

204
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,981
He said you were
very discreet.

205
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,719
That's the most important thing for me,
discretion.

206
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,693
Of course, with me,
it's not like it was with Randy.

207
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,026
It's not industrial espionage. But
you take other cases, don't you?

208
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,499
Not unless I know
the client's name.

209
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,558
Oh, I... I'm...
I'm really sorry.

210
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,001
(STUTTERING) I'm not
always like this.

211
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,233
It's just that lately,
I've been...

212
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,035
I'm Linda. Linda Gustavo.

213
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,405
How do you do?

214
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,104
Mrs. Hector Gustavo.

215
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,214
Randy told us
what you charge,

216
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,148
so we don't have
to talk about that.

217
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,312
I'll pay you for a week in advance,
not including expenses,

218
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,786
since we don't know
what they are.

219
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,381
If it takes more than a week,
I'll be happy to pay you more.

220
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,358
Is that all right?
Oh, sounds fine.

221
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,396
(STUTTERING) I just have to
know what you want me to do.

222
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,831
(LAUGHING) You know,
is it some sort of investigation?

223
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,632
Investigation.
Yes. Yes.

224
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,536
(STUTTERING)
This is very difficult.

225
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,903
(SIGHING)

226
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,841
(STAMMERING) I...
I'm just going to say it.

227
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,745
I'm going to put it out there
and I'm going to deal with it.

228
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,514
I am not going to cry.

229
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,915
Thank you.

230
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,288
I think my husband is
sleeping with another woman.

231
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,291
No, I don't think,
I know he's sleeping with her.

232
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,349
Mrs. Gustavo...

233
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:39,627
He comes home, he smells from her perfume,
his clothes, his hair.

234
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,894
(SOBBING)

235
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,436
Do you know how long it's
been since we made love?

236
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,533
Before, he couldn't
take his hands off me.

237
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:51,372
I even know who it is.
All I need is proof.

238
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,242
Mrs. Gustavo...

239
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,337
(SIGHS)

240
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,816
...you don't know how
difficult this is for me, but,

241
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,445
much as I'd like to help you,
I don't handle domestic cases.

242
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,422
It isn't a question of money.

243
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:11,293
I know. You think if you give me proof,
I'm gonna go crazy,

244
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,332
and I'm gonna kill my
husband. I 'am not...

245
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,993
Well, no, I... ...going to kill my husband,
Mr. Rockford.

246
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,367
I am not even going to kill
that tramp from the office.

247
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,465
He's going to fire her
and never see her again.

248
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,077
I have been married
for 12 years.

249
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:32,209
Do you think I am going to let Eleanor
Hooperman just walk off with Hector?

250
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:36,153
Mrs. Gustavo,
when I went into this business years ago,

251
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,054
I made just one promise
to myself.

252
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,058
No domestic cases.

253
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,993
Now, I've never broken that promise,
and I don't intend to now.

254
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,962
No matter how much
I'd like to help you...

255
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,523
No, no. Don't do that.
Now, don't do that.

256
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,834
That's way too much. There are
some very good people out there.

257
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,237
They're easy to
talk to, discreet.

258
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,833
I'd be happy to refer someone.

259
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,775
Why don't I
just kill myself?

260
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:01,712
I'd rather be dead
than run all over town,

261
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,375
telling total strangers
about my sex life.

262
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,713
I'm a total stranger.

263
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,584
No, you're not.
You know Randy.

264
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,145
Now, you said
you weren't going to cry.

265
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,850
(CRYING) I can't help it.

266
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,085
You took Randy's money.

267
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,895
Why won't you take mine?

268
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,463
You don't know how difficult
you're making this for me.

269
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,867
(STUTTERING) I mean,
as much as I'd like to help you,

270
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,339
this just isn't my kind
of case. Not at all.

00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,807
That's not your
kind of case?

273
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,310
Sure, it is.

274
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,041
What'd you do for
the lady, Rockford?

275
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,981
Break into some
cheesy hotel room

276
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,750
with a photographer,
catching Gustavo in flagrante delicto?

277
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,984
Yeah, me and Lyle Talbot,
we work as a team.

278
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,652
Does he have to be here?

279
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,126
Yes.

280
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,496
Can we get some
decent coffee in here?

281
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,433
Good idea.

282
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,665
So, you got hired
by Linda Gustavo

283
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,400
to get the goods
on her old man.

284
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,408
And you did this
by following him?

285
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,910
Well, I followed him, yeah.

286
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,003
I also got a job at his record company,
Felicidad Records.

287
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,016
Which is where you had the
confrontation with Bud Monckton.

288
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,553
No, which is where he had
his confrontation with me.

289
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,886
The guy's paranoid. I...
He runs security for them.

290
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,755
He thought I was trying
to steal the account.

291
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:24,161
I was just trying to check up
on Gustavo from the inside.

292
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,030
So, I wrote a few glossy
letters of recommendation.

293
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,263
I got exactly the job
I was shooting for.

294
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,829
It gave me unquestioned access
to the whole complex,

295
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,069
and at the same time
it rendered me invisible.

she's not in...

going to be asking for it, you know.

298
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,743
It's on his desk.

299
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,789
He'll probably want me to
rewrite it before lunch. Again.

going to let him ruin my work.

listen to this and give me that.

I think that's your
problem right there.

315

You rewrote the life
out of it. Put it away.

of days. See what happens.

Not that we have her.

Your .38 wasn't there,
so they decided not to charge you.

505

At least, not yet. Too
circumstantial without the weapon.

506

What do you mean
it wasn't there?

507
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,808
They looked in the cookie
jar. They found Oreos.

508
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,572
Did they look
under the Oreos?

509
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,740
These are trained police officers. Of
course, they looked under the Oreos.

faster if you'd stop trying to help me.

555

I didn't hear about his
death until I came back home.

Well,
you always used to call before you came up,

"Can we make it next weekend?"

you were there.

to share you.

with that, aren't you?

with the idea that Rocky

579
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:39,580
could have a relationship
with somebody,

580
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,914

anything about it.

up to point that out?

that out on my own.

looks like you missed a couple of chapters.

00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,484
Are you here to confess?

670
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,211
Excuse me?

671
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,755
Well, I don't
mean to pry, but,

672
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,383
I have been here for 45 minutes,
and you just came in.

673
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,584
I'm an attorney.

674
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,892
Oh, I don't need one.
I did it.

675
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:01,723
Oh.

676
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,597
(CHUCKLES)

677
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,293
(SNICKERS)

678
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,737
(STAMMERING) I'm just...
I'm just going...

679
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,467
(MAN SHOUTING)

680
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,667
Bye.

681
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:14,074
Hi, Sally. SALLY: Good morning,
Commander.

682
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,079
I may have to get myself
a larger office.

683
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,555
Did you get
everybody's statement?

684
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,286
No, sir, I was
waiting for you.

685
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,020
Thank you.

686
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:35,465
Oh, you've been spending so much time here,
you're practically family.

687
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,558
So, where do we start?

688
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,264
Well, could we start with a
couple of industrial strength aspirin?

689
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,703
I have the worst headache.

690
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:44,674
You're a real chronic complainer,
aren't you, Rockford?

691
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,734
You always gotta find
something to bellyache about.

692
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,336
Do you have an aspirin?

693
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,812
I don't get headaches.

694
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,407
Yeah? Well, you give 'em.

695
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,077
Jess?
Sorry.

696
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,210
Dennis?

697
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:59,120
Becker doesn't have any aspirin,
Rockford. Nobody here has any aspirin.

698
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,056
Could we please
just get on with this?

699
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,686
I can lay it out for you in very
simple terms, Commander.

700
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:04,752
He was following me.

701
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,160
Right away, that's a lie!

702
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:07,426
He followed us.

703
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,797
I was following them
because he was following me.

704
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,530
You know, believe it or not,
that actually makes sense.

705
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,299
HECTOR: After what happened
to Bud Monckton

706
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,840
and Mr. Rockford's
involvement in that...

707
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,204
I had no involvement in that.

708
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,972
I wanted to know why
I was being followed.

709
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,013
I demanded to know
who hired him.

710
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,172
Your wife hired him.

711
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,272
What?

712
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,783
Damn it, Chapman,
that's inexcusable.

713
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,114
But... That's
privileged information.

714
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,087
You can't just blat out something
that was told to you in confidence.

715
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,248
My wife?

716
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,287
Yeah. Yeah, Linda.

717
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,522
Uh, 52", 5'3",
exotic looking.

718
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,530
I'm not married.
I've never been married.

719
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,391
Your friend, Randy Silvero,
recommended me.

720
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,035
I don't know any
Randy Silvero.

721
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,768
Randy Silvero's not a
figment of my imagination.

722
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:54,244
He's the CEO of a Fortune
500 company. Check it out.

723
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,404
Mmm.

724
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,881
You say you don't know
who Linda Gustavo is?

725
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,748
Well, neither do I. But
she claims to be your wife.

726
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,753
She even overpaid me
to work for her.

727
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,153
I've never done
a domestic case before.

728
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,089
Looks like
you still haven't.

729
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,161
I would like to know why I
get stuck babysitting you.

730
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,199
It's getting out of hand.
They see you, they think me.

731
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,927
It's like we're joined
at the hip or something.

732
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,799
They could've kept you
in a holding cell.

733
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,861
Are you listening to what's
coming out of your mouth?

734
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,429
Put me in a holding cell?

735
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,736
Well, they could
teach you something.

736
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,834
At least, you'd realize that you
could stay out of trouble for 24 hours.

737
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,676
Dennis, I am trapped in
a Kafkaesque nightmare.

738
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,513
Don't rap me across the
knuckles. Get me some aspirin.

739
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,985
What is this,
a Christian Science Reading Room?

740
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:38,751
I'd think twice about ticking off the
one friend you have in the department.

741
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,382
Your timing is
not real good.

742
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,948
Hi, Sally.
Hi, Lieutenant.

743
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,288
Oh! Hey, Becker.
How's it going?

744
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,387
Never better.

745
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,489
Oh. That's not what I heard.

746
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,935
(LAUGHING)

747
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,061
What he heard?

748
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:56,540
Oh, he doesn't
know anything, Dennis.

749
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,737
Don't bet on it. He's always
sucking up to the brass.

750
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,610
Hey, Pete, get Sally
a cup of coffee

751
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,978
and tell her
I'll be a little while.

752
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,949
Sure.
Two sugars.

753
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,918
She's a regular.
Well, so am.

754
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,888
You couldn't have had Pete pick up
a couple of aspirin while he was at it?

755
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,948
Would you knock it off? You're
getting to sound like a real junkie.

756
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,722
Do you know that bees
can die of loneliness?

757
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,528
Well, they can.

758
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,807
Do you have any idea how
long I've been waiting for you?

759
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,540
What are you doing here?

760
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,809
I thought I was
your attorney.

761
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,509
I thought you weren't.

762
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,643
Well, I could hardly
leave you unrepresented.

763
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,211
Not with the regularity
you're getting hauled in here.

764
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,054
Don't touch those. Those
are the revisions on my book.

765
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,751
I feel like I need
a program to keep up.

766
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,388
It wouldn't help.

767
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,454
So, what happened
this time?

768
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,591
Well, this time,
it seems to be Gaslight,

769
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,330
and I seem to be playing
the Ingrid Bergman role.

770
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,565
Do you have any aspirin?

771
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,107
I don't think so. Were you
in Diehl's office with Becker?

772
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,235
With the gruff
but lovable Chapman.

773
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,745
(STAMMERS) You didn't
make a statement?

774
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,838
Of course, I made a statement. If I didn't
make a statement, I wouldn't be out here.

775
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,440
You didn't sign anything?

776
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:14,576
I signed the statement.
Without counsel present?

777
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,416
I didn't know I had counsel.

778
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,182
Are you sure you don't
have any aspirin?

779
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,884
I'm going to talk to Diehl.
That really ticks me off.

780
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,991
She made herself right
at home. Did you see that?

781
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,294
It may not be
the corner office,

782
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,391
but it's my office
and my desk.

783
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,407
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

784
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,273
I have a theory, Dennis.
My theory is that you,

785
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,210
Beth, everybody has aspirin,

786
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,271
but for some inexplicable reason,
nobody'll cop to it.

787
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,408
Like it has some
sort of stigma attached.

788
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,549
Well, nobody ever
collaborated with the Nazis,

789
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:55,389
nobody ever spoke,
and now nobody has aspirin.

790
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,484
(EXCLAIMS)

791
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,756
Now, what does
that look like?

792
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,524
|I don't know,
and neither do you.

793
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,623
Yeah, well I say
it's aspirin. Any water?

794
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,303
Hey, I'm not gonna let
you take that... Now, now...

795
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,701
Hey, give me that thing!
Give me that!

796

(MUMBLING)

798
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,279
I don't believe you did
something so damn stupid.

799
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,371
(SIGHING)
Shut up, Dennis.

800
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,382
All I want to do
is sit here

801
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,578
and be real quiet
till this stuff kicks in.

802
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:24,145
What stuff? You don't
even know what you took.

803
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,215
All right,
I talked to Diehl.

804
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,056
He said that Hector Gustavo
will not file assault charges

805
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,323
if you will agree
to psychiatric help.

806
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,455
Go for it.

807
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,056
What happened?

808
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,727
Oh, I'm sorry, Beth.
I guess I should've waited,

809
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,294
but I really had to get
something for this headache.

810
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,465
I told you I didn't
have any aspirin.

811
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,066
Oh, you said you thought
you didn't. I found some.

812
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,113
I took two. You think that's
enough to knock this headache?

813
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,978
I don't know, but you won't have
to worry about water retention.

814
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:52,642
These are for PMS.

815
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,918
(EXHALES)

816
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,650
That's just great.

817
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,283
Hey, where the hell do
you think you're going?

818
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,918
Hey, come back
here! Hey!

819
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,361
Chapman!

820
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,865
Chapman, I've decided
not to hang around

821
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,629
for the rest of
the inquisition.

822
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,297
I know you're having a hell of a good time,
but I'm not.

823
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,636
I've got a killer headache,
I'm tired,

824
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,803
and I don't enjoy seeing
even a lousy cop like you

825
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,538
make this big
an ass of himself.

826
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:23,478
(BECKER SCOFFING)
Jim, I really think...

827
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:26,711
You've got bupkis for a case against me,
and you know it.

828
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,481
So, cut me loose now
or book me.

829
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,987
Okay. I'll book you.

830
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,151
On circumstantial evidence?

831
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,422
Finding my gun
doesn't change anything.

832
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,985
Your own men can testify

833
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,054
it wasn't on my premises
the night of the murder.

834
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,191
They tore my
whole place apart.

835
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,931
And then, all of a sudden,
somebody dials 911,

836
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,440
I get rousted, and where's
the missing weapon?

837

a lot of people think
it's a 10-4 in his sex life.

867

looks like that just as a friend.

worrying about comfort.

am I supposed to have done?

you just cooperate?

00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,683
Well, a taquito
should certainly do that.

1009
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,224
ROCKFORD: Two taquitos.

1010
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,357
So,
on the phone you said you were in trouble.

1011
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,521
Yeah, that's me,
master of understatement.

1012
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,690
Are you talking new
trouble? More trouble? What?

1013
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,699
It doesn't seem possible,
does it?

1014
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:10,859
Thank you.

1015
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,198
Jim, the last time
I saw you,

1016
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,737
the FBI had you
in handcuffs.

1017
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,205
Yeah?
Well, they still do.

1018
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,365
What happened?

1019
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,102
Well, it's a
little complicated,

1020
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:23,841
but Chapman can now add grand
theft auto to his list of charges.

1021
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,905
You didn't steal a car
from the FBI.

1022
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:27,382
It was either that
or be kidnapped.

1023
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,680
(LAUGHS)

1024
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,746
You know,
Rocky never understood

1025
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,880
why you wanted to
be a private investigator.

1026
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,652
I have to admit,
I don't either.

1027
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,853
I don't know how you go
through that all the time.

1028
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,521
You think this is
my average work day?

1029
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:41,923
If it were,
I'd be dead in a week.

1030
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:43,091
Where's the rental?

1031
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,693
Around the corner,
end of the block.

1032
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,869
It's not a rental.
I'm driving my own car.

1033
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,841
That's no good.
I told you to rent one.

1034
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,469
I can't leave you
without a car.

1035
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,411
Well, I don't intend
to be left.

1036
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,039
Then I don't intend
to take you with me.

1037
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,947
Damn it, Jess,
I'm running from the cops,

1038
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,679
the FBI,
and a cast of thousands.

1039
00:52:02,753 --> 00:52:05,518
I... I'm wanted for murder.

1040
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,284
You could be charged
with aiding and abetting.

1041
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,452
You could be looking
at serious time.

1042
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,291
You don't like my terms,
you better call somebody else.

1043
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,922
Oh, why don't you call
your friend Becker?

1044
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:14,988
No, no, no, he's a cop.

1045
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,829
He'd have to turn
you in, right? Yeah.

1046
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,562
Oh. What about
your attorney, Beth?

1047
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,366
(SMACKING LIPS) Wouldn't work,
either, would it?

1048
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,805
Because as an attorney
she's an officer of the court,

1049
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,899
and she'd have to
turn you in, too.

1050
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:30,738
My, my, my, my,
we have a real predicament here, don't we?

1051
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,442
I'll drive.
Okay.

1052
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,553
JESS: Jim, I really think
this is a mistake.

1053
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:44,322
I mean, the Highway Patrol
is always all over the place.

1054
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:46,659
ROCKFORD: I'm not going
anywhere near the cove.

1055
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,199
According to what, I hope,
is reliable information,

1056
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,758
Angel should be
right along here.

1057
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,530
Here, here it is.

1058
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,228
This is a step up
for him.

1059
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,959
His last place
had cardboard walls.

1060
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,125
You sure he'll take you in?

1061
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,532
I'm sure.

1062

(DOORBELL CHIMING)

1063
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,401
So, he must be
a really good friend.

1064
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:36,606
Angel? He'd sell me by
the pound if he had a buyer.

1065
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,045
He owes me.

1066
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,846
Jimmy, what are
you doing here?

1067
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,479
Who told you
how to find me?

1068
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,750
It was Pastorelli,
wasn't it?

1069
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:48,315
That guy doesn't know the
meaning of keeping his mouth shut.

1070
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,760
This is my punishment for
even talking to that creep.

1071
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:52,990
Did anybody see you
come in here?

1072
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,031
Nobody saw us.

1073
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,464
Okay. Well, just don't
stand around out here

1074
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,365
waiting for some gardener
to make a positive I.D.

1075
00:53:58,435 --> 00:53:59,800
Get in, get in!

1076
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,275
Angel, this is
Jess Wilding.

1077
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,174
Who cares? It's not
like you're gonna stay.

1078
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,144
ROCKFORD: Angel?
I can't hear you, Jimmy.

1079
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:10,942
Can't, can't hear a word
you're saying.

1080
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,812
Don't try to talk me
into nothing.

1081
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:15,511
Every time I get something good going,
you show up.

1082
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,917
You're like some giant cat

1083
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:20,924
who's all the time leaving
dead rats on my doorstep.

1084
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,356
What am I supposed to say,
thank you?

1085
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,952
What do you think, I can't come up
with enough dead rats on my own?

1086
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,655
What the hell
are you talking about?

1087
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,427
You're hot, man.
You got that wanted smell.

1088
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,265
You're all over the tube.
They got an APB out on you.

1089
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,462
What, you didn't know that?

1090
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:36,472
Well, that's one dead rat
I ain't getting nowheres near.

1091
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,599
Just keeps getting better,
doesn't it?

1092
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,666
Where's the TV?

1093
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:41,905
Where is it, Angel?

1094
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,469
I won't tell you.

1095
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:46,312
You think I'm gonna let you
squat here watching television

1096
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,374
while they're putting your
picture up in the post office?

1097
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,420
You're making me an
accessory after the fact.

1098
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,615
Well, look on it
as a refreshing change.

1099
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,783
You're usually an
accessory before the fact.

1100
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:56,189
Don't make me
call the cops, Jim.

1101
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,230
I don't want to do that. It's
not like there's a reward out.

1102
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,025
Why don't we
get out of here?

1103
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,896
You heard what he said.

1104
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,365
If there was a reward
out on you,

1105
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,731
he'd turn you in
just like that.

1106
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,465
Like you wouldn't. I love
these holier-than-thou types.

1107
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,064
Where's the TV?

1108
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:16,409
Is this the channel where
you heard about the APB?

1109
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,471
Yeah, they keep cutting in
with these bulletins.

1110
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:21,314
Like, who cares about some
guy nobody ever heard of

1111
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:23,683
killing some other guy
nobody ever heard of?

1112
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:24,949
Where's the remote?

1113
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:26,114
I'll make
a deal with you.

1114
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,056
Just hand it over, okay?

1115
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,457
You stay here
until the next update,

1116
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,894
and then when you're brought up to speed,
you're out of here.

1117
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,761
I'll make a deal with you.

1118
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,301
You hand me the remote
and I won't break your arm.

1119
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,003
You're not making
any friends here today.

1120
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,538
You know,
the next time you need me,

1121
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:43,937
I just might not
be there for you.

1122
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,499
You're not there
for me now, Angel.

1123
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,238
It's on. It's a bulletin.
Turn on the sound.

1124
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:50,110
FEMALE REPORTER ON TV:
...where the vehicle had been abandoned

1125
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,443
at Sixth and Alameda.

1126
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:55,474
The discovery was made by a
police officer on routine traffic control.

1127
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,714
To recap this
late-breaking story,

1128
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,847
private investigator,
James Rockford,

1129
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:03,223
charged with the murder of
fellow investigator, Bud Monckton,

1130
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,194
is being sought tonight by both
the Los Angeles Police Department

1131
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,628
and the FBI.

1132
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,860
At a news conference
held earlier today,

1133
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,129
Captain Chapman
had this to say.

1134
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,897
The murder apparently
resulted from

1135
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,565
a longstanding
and bitter business rivalry.

1136
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,904
Both Bud Monckton
and James Rockford

1137
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:21,172
specialized in
low-end divorce work.

1138
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,679
There was a history of
violence... How can he say that?

1139
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,942
...between the men that ended
tragically... I don't take domestic cases.

1140
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:26,449
...with the death of
Mr. Monckton.

1141
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,110
I would ask any citizen
who sees this man

1142
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:31,177
to report the sighting
to the police.

1143
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:34,919
Under no circumstances should
anyone attempt to approach Mr. Rockford.

1144
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:38,087
He may be armed,
and should be considered dangerous.

Again, an all points bulletin has
been issued for James Rockford,

and be supportive.

00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,126
You better go home, Jess.

1157
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,829
What, and leave you here
all alone to have all this fun?

good at this sort of thing.

the hell's going on here.

Every time I think
I'm getting a fix on it,

1162
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,273
it morphs into something
completely different.

1163
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:31,371

Did I say sit down?

1164
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,813

make yourself comfortable?

this particular bridge,

1168

need it again,

it's gone for good.

I'd give him the shirt off my back.

1173
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,957
Why not? It doesn't belong to you,
and neither does this house.

1174
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:54,902
All I'm asking for is a few
square feet out of a possible 5,000.

1175
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,462
I can't do it, Jimmy.

1176
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,974
I mean, it kills me
to say this,

1177
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,510
but you guys gotta move it.
The caterer's here.

1178
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,703
The caterer?

1179
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,338
Nothing fancy. Pigs in the blanket,
a couple of dips.

1180
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,178
But they want to
set up out here,

1181
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,978
and now that you're among
America's most wanted,

1182
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,416
well, they just
ain't gonna get it.

1183
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,286
Angel, I wouldn't last
10 minutes out on the street.

1184
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:15,553
Put me in the maid's room,
the garage.

1185
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,719
Just till dark.
I'll take my chances then.

1186
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,886
Oh, Jimmy!

1187
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,192
Hey...
I'll owe you, Angel.

1188
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,062
Wouldn't that make
a nice change?

1189
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,529
Why me?

1190
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,833
Because, deep down,
you're a really nice person.

1191
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,105
I know that.

1192
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,373
All right. Come on.

1193
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,540
Now, when the party
gets rolling,

1194
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,243
you got these types
that like to look around,

1195
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:42,547
so I'm gonna
put you in the back

1196
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,348
where there shouldn't be
too much foot traffic.

1197
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:45,911
I know it's none of
my business, Angel,

1198
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:47,252
but what are
you doing here?

1199
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:48,985
You're living
like Donald Trump,

1200
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,254
you're throwing
catered parties.

1201
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:51,886
You can't afford
to give a party.

1202
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,293
I can't afford
not to give one.

1203
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,195
Invite the right people.
That's how deals are made.

1204
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,596
That's how
careers are born.

1205
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,600
Now, when it comes
to the caterer,

1206
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,693
well, that's bare bones stuff,
like I said.

1207
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:03,263
What costs is the hard stuff,
but I'm not serving that.

1208
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,399
It's just wine and
name brand mineral water,

1209
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,273
and Mr. Brophy's never
gonna know it's gone.

1210
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:09,073
Mr. Brophy is
the owner here?

1211
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,807
ANGEL: It's one of those
Mr. and Mrs.

1212
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,747
You-Can-Go-To-Hell
divorce cases.

1213
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:16,650
You see, Mr. Go-To-Hell said
that I should stay here on the pad

1214
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,552
while he's in London
doing business.

1215
00:59:18,622 --> 00:59:21,489
He's afraid that Mrs.
You-Can-Go-To-Hell is gonna slip in

1216
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,356
and slide off
with the family silver,

1217
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:24,861
and he wouldn't
give her a pickle fork.

1218
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:28,228
Is this where you're putting us,
huh? In this wine cellar?

1219
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,266
Yeah, until dark.
That's our agreement.

1220
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,630
How are we going to know
when it's dark?

1221
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,135
There aren't any
windows in here.

1222
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,295
Yeah, and no one'll
see you,

1223
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,805
and no one's gonna
blow the whistle.

1224
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,135
You want to lay low?

1225
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:38,641
Don't get much lower
than this.

1226
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,405
Here, chill.
Have some vino.

1227
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:43,276
Mouton Rothschild?

1228
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,839
1961. You're not serving this,
are you?

1229
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,078
What's wrong with it?
Well, nothing.

1230
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,610
It just goes for seven,
$800 a bottle.

1231
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:52,917
What's the white
he's got?

1232
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,253
Conti Montrachet, 1987.

1233
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:58,522
Oh, hey, that only goes
for $800 a bottle on up.

1234
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,428
That should go very nicely
with the pigs in a blanket.

1235
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:03,057
Seems to me you've got
enough to worry about

1236
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:05,033
besides what I choose
to serve at my party.

1237
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,501
I just worry that
you're serving it

1238
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,299
from somebody else's
wine cellar.

1239
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,568
You pop just one of those corks,
Angel, it's grand theft.

1240
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,803
You just run on down
to the police station,

1241
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,140
and then you can
turn me in.

1242
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:18,409
(CHUCKLES) Hey, maybe we can
do time together. Be like old times.

1243
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:20,348
That is, until they drop
a pellet on you.

1244
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:21,782
Chin-chin.

1245
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,586
Regular Hallmark card,
isn't it?

1246
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,990
Yeah, I'm almost tempted
to open one of these

1247
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,723
if I didn't feel so sorry
for Mr. You-Can-Go-To-Hell.

1248
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:37,529
You have no idea the damage
Angel can do without even trying.

1249
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,070
Jim, I've been thinking
about this.

1250
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,337
The police don't have
an APB out on me.

1251
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:46,535
I'm not on any wanted list.

1252
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,305
Why don't you tell me
what you would do

1253
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,346
if you could do it,
and let me do it instead?

1254
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,575
Oh, no, that's very nice,
I appreciate that, but nothing...

1255
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,741
I'm a very capable person.

1256
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,285
Capable has nothing
to do with it.

1257
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:56,786
You don't know what
you'd be dealing with here.

1258
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,184
Neither do I.

1259
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:00,383
I know it got one man killed
and put me in a frame

1260
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,482
I can't seem to break out of.

1261
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,254
What are you suggesting?
That we just give up?

1262
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,728
No. Well, hey, I don't know.

1263
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,127
Damned thing
doesn't make any sense.

1264
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:11,259
Everything makes sense if
you put the pieces together right.

1265
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,358
Okay?

1266
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:13,994
What's the first piece here?

1267
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,901
Linda Gustavo,
she hires you.

1268
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,444
Only it turns out
there is no Linda Gustavo.

1269
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,036
You know, I've been
thinking about that.

1270
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:26,481
I mean, she really put on
a convincing performance.

1271
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,111
She conned me into taking a
job I swore I'd never go near.

1272
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,450
An actress.

1273
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,889
Well, enough of those running
around this town that could use a gig.

1274
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:37,359
She could be the one
that dialed 911

1275
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:40,226
and told the cops to look
in the trunk of my car

1276
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:42,493
for the gun
they planted there.

1277
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:44,295
But who hired her, and why?

1278
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,926
I don't know.

1279
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:49,666
But my gut feeling tells me it has
something to do with Felicidad Records.

1280
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:51,833
I mean,
there's something weird about that company.

1281
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:54,434
Mmm. Music-business word
is not uncommon.

1282
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,536
No, no,
it goes beyond that.

1283
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:59,139
Why is there
a huge framed photograph

1284
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,981
of President Reagan
hanging in the executive john?

1285
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,387
They're Republicans?

1286
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,445
Clandestine Republicans?

1287
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:09,151
Why wouldn't they hang it
in a place of honor?

1288
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,252
Why do they have these
satellite photographs

1289
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:16,926
of the rain forest or some damn
thing? And surveillance photos?

1290
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,095
I don't know. Really confusing,
isn't it?

1291
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,538
I'll tell you something else. There's
enough Latins running around in all this

1292
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:26,736
to do a remake of one
of those old Fox musicals.

1293
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:33,314
Whoever Linda Gustavo is,
she pointed me directly at Hector Gustavo.

1294
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,776
Or Felicidad Records. Or...

1295
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,549
Bud Monckton.

1296
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:42,490
Yeah, you see? You see,
this whole Bud Monckton thing,

1297
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,119
that's a real sour note
in all this.

1298
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:49,393
I mean, the FBI should've never
even heard of a slimeball like Monckton.

1299
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:53,494
They not only knew about him,
he had some information they wanted.

1300
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,835
You sure you don't
have any aspirin?

1301
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,704
I'm getting my headache
back again.

1302
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,676
Forget your headache for now.
We're on to something here.

1303
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,042
You want to tell me
what it is?

1304
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,411
Bud Monckton.

1305
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:06,972
You didn't know
Hector Gustavo,

1306
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,643
you didn't know
Felicidad Records,

1307
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,686
but you had a history
with Bud Monckton.

1308
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,984
A violent history,
as Chapman would say.

1309
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,191
Somebody wanted to off ol' Bud,
for reasons yet to be determined.

1310
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,229
Put me in the picture,
you've got the perfect patsy.

1311
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,425
That's not bad
for the IRS.

1312
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:23,557
Thank you.

1313
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,102
(EXHALES DEEPLY) I've had so
much coming at me from all directions,

1314
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,638
I guess I went into
overload and shorted out.

1315
01:03:29,773 --> 01:03:31,002
I don't have any answers yet

1316
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:32,735
but I know where to find 'em.

1317
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,210
Six for the road. Service
door at the end of the corridor.

1318
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,269
Turn out the lights. Adios.

1319
01:03:38,782 --> 01:03:40,477
Pigs in a blanket.

1320
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,847
(LAUGHING)

1321
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:46,219
Jim, who do you think
would want to kill Monckton?

1322
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,723
Anybody that ever met him.

1323
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:50,988
(CHUCKLES) No, you gotta
narrow it down a little bit for me.

1324
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:52,722
Now, whoever
killed Monckton

1325
01:03:52,796 --> 01:03:54,457
is the person
who's framing you.

1326
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:57,023
Well, it's beautifully
cold blooded, you know.

1327
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,797
I mean, steal my gun,
use it on Monckton,

1328
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:02,497
and plant it back on me.
Nothing personal.

1329
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,040
I'm just in it
to take the fall.

1330
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:06,007
That sounded
a lot like admiration.

1331
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:10,309
Well, hey,
you'd almost have to admire anything

1332
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,974
that's put together with that
much thought and precision.

1333
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,211
It's put together
like a Swiss watch.

1334
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:17,151
There's the murder weapon,
there's videotape

1335
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,848
of the two of us wailing away
at each other in the hall,

1336
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:23,450
more video tape from a security
camera at Monckton's house

1337
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:27,929
clocking me in at 9:45, the night of
the murder, and never clocking me out.

1338
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:28,987
Why not?

1339
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,362
'Cause I left
by the back door.

1340
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,232
Now, either he didn't have a
security camera on that door,

1341
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:37,365
or it wasn't working. But anyway,
gunshots were heard at 10:30.

1342
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,204
Now, I have nothing
to prove I was anywhere

1343
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,243
but right there
pulling the trigger.

1344
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:44,145
If I make it, I'll call you.

1345
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,511
No, no, no, wait.
I want to go with you.

1346
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:47,414
No, no. No, Jess. No,
Jess. Yes, I...

1347
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:49,714
You can't afford to say no.
You don't have a car.

1348
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:53,120
I will, just as soon as I hot
wire whatever's in the garage.

1349
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:56,284
Hey, when you're in
as much trouble as I am,

1350
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,123
it's really
kind of liberating.

1351
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,683
(SIREN WAILING)

1352
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,869
Damn.

1353
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,474
CHAPMAN: You know
how lucky you are?

1354
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:51,981
Well, no, Chapman.
Just how lucky am I?

1355
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:54,745
Flight to avoid arrest when
you're wanted for a capital crime?

1356
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:55,979
You could have been shot.

1357
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,248
Well, you're handling your
disappointment well, I'll give you that.

1358
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,154
You think of yourself as some
kind of great comic, don't you?

1359
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:02,953
Well, you're not funny.
You've never been funny.

1360
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:05,358
Oh, sure I have. You've just
never heard my best material.

1361
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,827
I save it for
the dinner crowd.

1362
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,990
Come on, let's get this over
with. It's been a long day.

1363
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,534
And a busy one.
Two GTAs in six hours,

1364
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:13,626
and the last one has
an interesting history.

1365
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:17,003
It was reported stolen two weeks
ago by a Mrs. Lenore Brophy.

1366
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,563
Her husband stole it,
not me.

1367
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,075
And I have it
on very good authority,

1368
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,441
he wouldn't
give her a pickle fork.

1369
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,108
Jim...

1370
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,384
We don't need you here,
Lieutenant.

1371
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,716
Yes, I was just escorting
Mr. Rockford's counsel...

1372
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:35,247
She knows the way. And when
did it become Mr. Rockford?

1373
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,759
What happened to Jimbo?

1374
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,987
You're here to see
if you can do anything

1375
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:39,085
for your old buddy,
aren't you?

1376
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,290
No, sir. I'm just
escorting Miss Davenport...

1377
01:06:41,364 --> 01:06:42,456
Van Sant.

1378
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:45,991
Well, you can't do anything for him,
Becker, so don't even try.

1379
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:49,198
Not if you give a damn about
your career in law enforcement.

1380
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:52,503
Now, take a look. There's
a lesson to be learned here.

1381
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,236
You know what
that lesson is?

1382
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,736
Try "Crime doesn't pay.”

1383
01:07:01,284 --> 01:07:04,777
Hey, uh, thanks for
being here, I...

1384
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:08,525
Nice dress. Maybe
not for this occasion.

1385
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,559
Are you going to start
with me again?

1386
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,026
I was at a dinner party.

1387
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:13,859
Actually,
I was the hostess.

1388
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,025
I had to walk out on my
husband and all my guests.

1389
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,967
I used to eat dinner.
All the time.

1390
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,137
What'd you serve?
Give me the menu.

1391
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,901
Start with the
hors d'oeuvres.

1392
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:28,911
Jim, you getting hysterical or
something? How do you feel?

1393
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:32,073
Like Job
without the boils.

1394
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,581
They ought to be popping
out any minute now.

1395
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,958
That's 5, 10, 11

1396
01:07:44,027 --> 01:07:48,624
12, 25, 35, 36, 37.

1397
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,560
That's $12.37.

1398
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,632
Make you nervous walking
around with all that cash?

1399
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:58,106
I want you to make a list of everything
that goes into that property envelope,

1400
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,108
and ask the sergeant
to sign off on it.

1401
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,337
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

1402
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,469
Listen,
if I could just...

1403
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,344
It means, the last time I was
a guest of this establishment,

1404
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:08,577
a silver money clip went into
the envelope and never came out.

1405
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:09,675
That's a lie.

1406
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,084
That's not a lie, Chapman.
My complaint's on file.

1407
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:14,214
Excuse me...
Shut up, Becker.

1408
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,692
You accusing the police of
stealing your lousy money clip?

1409
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,694
You're not listening, Chapman.
I didn't say that.

1410
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,753
I said it disappeared,
that's all.

1411
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,459
I'm just asking for a little backup
paperwork this time around.

1412
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:25,558
Jim...

1413
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:26,966
That's, uh, that's...

1414
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,231
That's what?

1415
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:30,363
You looking for
some more charges?

1416
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,204
You've got too many
to deal with as it is.

1417
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,834
Will you stop
antagonizing him?

1418
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,105
What's the matter with you?

1419
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,272
All right,
cut him loose, Chapman.

1420
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,439
What?
I said cut him loose.

1421
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,985
He's got a witness,
puts him at home at the time of the murder.

1422
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,076
What witness?

1423
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:48,386
A credible one, Captain.
Miss Wilding of the IRS.

1424
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,717
I'm sorry. I would have
come forward sooner.

1425
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,853
I just assumed that
you had all the facts

1426
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,796
as a result of
your investigation.

1427
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,130
Chapman never lets facts
clutter up a case he's on.

1428
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,566
I'm sure there are
any number of people

1429
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,196
that can corroborate me
on this.

1430
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,730
The Sand Castle was open. There
were all kinds of cars in the parking lot.

1431
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,503
And you say he got home when?

1432
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:10,012
10:45. You see,
I was waiting for him,

1433
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,411
so when he drove in,
I looked at my watch.

1434
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,416
I decided it was a little
too late to barge in on him,

1435
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,452
and I decided I'd come
back another time.

1436
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,682
There's no way that Rockford could
have shot Monckton downtown at 10:30,

1437
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:21,656
and get out to Paradise Cove
by 10:45.

1438
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,715
Not even the way he drives.

1439
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,727
Let's start by
losing the jewelry.

1440
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:27,263
Why? You're not
going anywhere.

1441
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,264
The hell I'm not.
The hell you are.

1442
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,267
Chapman, can I see you
in here for a minute?

1443
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,605
Let him go, Chapman.

1444
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,444
But, sir, we have
the murder weapon.

1445
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,142
His .38.
His prints all over it.

1446
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,446
And he has an alibi
for the time of the murder.

1447
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:51,317
Now, he could have
been set up, Chapman.

1448
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,116
You cannot overlook
that possibility.

1449
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,681
All right, all right,
maybe I can't make the murder charge stick,

1450
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,590
but I've got
a laundry list that will.

1451
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,754
Two GTAs,
flight to avoid arrest.

1452
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,763
And the threat of
legal action.

1453
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,061
You don't lighten up,
he's gonna go ahead with that suit.

1454
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,726
You really want to take
that into open court?

1455
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,395
It's gonna play like
a police vendetta,

1456
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,529
and the department doesn't
need that kind of trouble.

1457
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,131
Now, drop it, okay?
Just drop it.

1458
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,776
Counselor, we will not be
pressing charges against your client.

1459
01:10:17,847 --> 01:10:20,407
Not this time. Becker,
get your friend out of the irons

1460
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,884
and get him the
hell out of here.

1461
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,283
Yes, sir.

1462
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,556
(LAUGHS)

1463
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:31,754
Do you mind
waiting for me?

1464
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:32,954
I'd like to walk Beth
to her car.

1465
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:34,326
Sure. I parked
in the police lot.

1466
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,126
Bye, Beth.
Bye-bye.

1467
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,067
I want to thank you for being there for me,
Beth.

1468
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:42,195
Yeah.

1469
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,364
I want you to bill me.

1470
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,908
(LAUGHS) I will.

1471
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,746
There were a lot of
people there for you tonight.

1472
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:53,680
Becker and Jess.
She's a nice lady.

1473
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,152
I thought that was one of
those politically incorrect words.

1474
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,679
Yeah, well, it is. But I can
use it because I'm a woman.

1475
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:05,024
Is she going to be
somebody serious?

1476
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,090
Jess? She was Dad's friend.

1477
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,566
She's your type.

1478
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,701
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1479
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,238
Let me ask you something.

1480
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:21,071
If you were describing a
friendship you had with somebody,

1481
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:23,476
would you refer to it
as a relationship?

1482
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:25,981
You know,
using the word relationship

1483
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:28,415
instead of friendship,
but mean friendship?

1484
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,684
Why don't you just
ask her, Jim?

1485
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,183
Forget it.
I'll call you tomorrow.

1486
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:38,751
What's that mean?
Another four years,

1487
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:41,559
or just until you need
an attorney again?

1488
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,564
The town's full
of attorneys, Beth.

1489
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:49,603
It was just an excuse
to call you.

1490
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,436
I've been looking for one.

1491
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:54,943
I wanted you back in
my life. I've missed you.

1492
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,576
I missed you, too.

1493
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,145
You know what
really threw me, Jim?

1494
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,891
You were the one
who encouraged me

1495
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,086
to write the damn book
in the first place.

1496
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,726
And then to not
even read it...

1497
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,127
I read it, Beth.

1498
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:17,530
Oh, don't make it worse
by lying about it, Jim.

1499
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,262
I'm not lying, Beth.
I read it.

1500
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,532
Then why didn't you call me?

1501
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,705
I didn't like it.

1502
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:30,407
Well... I'm sorry, Beth.

1503
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,072
I... I didn't know
how to tell you.

1504
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:35,550
I... I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

1505
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:40,219
Well, say something.

1506
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,084
That's so sweet.

1507
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,421
(CHUCKLES) It's stupid,
but it's sweet.

1508
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,507
If you don't call me tomorrow,
I'm gonna call you.

1509
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:22,263
Well, you saved my life
in there, Jess.

1510
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,095
Thank you doesn't
quite cover it.

1511
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,161
God, I'm glad
that's over with.

1512
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,829
It isn't over. Not yet.

1513
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,202
We still don't know
who killed Bud Monckton.

1514
01:13:30,273 --> 01:13:32,139
I don't care who killed him.

1515
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:33,903
That may sound
a little cold...

1516
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,774
Sounds very cold.

1517
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:37,973
I never liked the man.

1518
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,242
I didn't like him
when I met him.

1519
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:42,580
I spent 20 years not liking
him. He was pond scum.

1520
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,179
May sound a little harsh,
but that's the way I feel.

1521
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:50,521
Jim, what would happen if
the police arrested you again?

1522
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:52,061
They won't. Yeah,
but what if they did?

1523
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,031
And what if it ends up
in court?

1524
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,363
You testify, and...

1525
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,327
But that's just it, Jim,
I can't.

1526
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,867
I can't testify under oath
that you were home by 10:45.

1527
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,334
I didn't check my watch.

1528
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:11,141
I wasn't waiting for you.

1529
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,272
I wasn't anywhere
near Paradise Cove.

1530
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,946
You...

1531
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,112
Lied.

1532
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,261
Want to check out
Bud Monckton's?

1533
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:49,284
Well, there's gonna be some lock picking
involved. You may want to wait here.

1534
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,387
(SIREN WAILING)

1535
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,293
Now, don't get
your hopes up.

1536
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,093
Monckton's isn't one of those
lofts that made Architectural Digest.

1537
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:04,223
(EXHALES)
It's pretty bare bones.

1538
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,701
Will the police still
have it sealed off?

1539
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:09,170
I'm in so much trouble,
I don't really give a damn.

1540
01:15:10,373 --> 01:15:12,341
You sure you don't want
to wait in the car?

1541
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,775
So far,
you're real clean on all this.

1542
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,642
Are you trying to
make me nervous?

1543
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,703
How are we going to
get into this place?

1544
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,044
This way.

1545
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:33,191
What about
the security camera?

1546
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:36,994
I doubt if anyone's checking
them now that Monckton's gone.

1547
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:40,400
But just in case,
I'll take care of them on the way out.

1548
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:02,182
Watch your step.

1549
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:05,785
His office is over here,
if that's what you want to call it.

1550
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,388
If we're gonna find anything,
we'll find it here.

1551
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,293
Don't you touch
anything, huh?

1552
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:15,201
If you do,
be sure and tell me

1553
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:18,104
so I can wipe your
prints off. Can you see?

1554
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:20,165
I'm fine. Let's go.

1555
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,732
You wait here.

1556
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,009
(GASPS)

1557
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,777
Oh, I'm sorry.

1558
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,375
I guess I should
have warned you.

1559
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:31,113
It kind of threw me
when I first saw it, too.

1560
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:34,817
I thought his obsession was
reserved for electronic bugs.

1561
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,016
Oh, God.

1562
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,253
You don't think there's any around
here that aren't in cases, do you?

1563
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,228
Not in his
appointment book.

1564
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:42,594
Is that what
we're looking for?

1565
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:43,826
Well, we're looking
for anything

1566
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,425
that'll tell us who and
what he was mixed up with.

1567
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,527
Felicidad Records,
for example.

1568
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,630
You know,
record companies make big bucks.

1569
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:54,438
Big bucks could mean
a mob connection.

1570
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,774
They'd have the talent
to take him out

1571
01:16:56,846 --> 01:17:00,248
and fashion a very
nice frame for me.

1572
01:17:00,316 --> 01:17:01,715
Well, what can I do?

1573
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,147
Want me to
check the computer?

1574
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,688
You know how?

1575
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,892
Where the hell's
his appointment book?

1576
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,955
Everybody has to have some
kind of calendar to work from.

1577
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:18,397
Well, it's probably
in here.

1578
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,765
You said the guy
was into electronics.

1579
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:24,100
Oh, yes.

1580
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:27,108
He's got everything in here,
including his grocery list.

1581
01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:31,012
It's blank.

1582
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,479
JESS: Well,
this is where it was.

1583
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:33,879
It was erased, I guess.

1584
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,849
Ah, that's just great.

1585
01:17:35,918 --> 01:17:37,682
Don't worry about it, Jim.
I'll get it back for you.

1586
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:38,777
You said it was erased.

1587
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,686
It is, but it's still
in there someplace.

1588
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,451
I just have to find it.

1589
01:17:42,525 --> 01:17:44,789
(CHUCKLES) I'm IRS,
I do this all the time.

1590
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:55,898
What'd I tell you?

1591
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:57,029
(EXCLAIMING)

1592
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:58,733
Scrolled ahead too far.

1593
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,902
Can you scroll it back
till you come to an entry?

1594
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,708
Got it! It's for tomorrow.

1595
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,838
What does it say?

1596
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,349
If you thought the FBI
connection was strange,

1597
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,475
I don't know what you're
going to make out of this.

1598
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:11,111
What does it say, Jess?

1599
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,882
Jim, Monckton has
a luncheon meeting

1600
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:14,946
scheduled for tomorrow

1601
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,254
with Senator Phillip Aspall.

1602
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,162
Oh, I think I better
keep that meeting.

1603
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,132
ROCKFORD: Senator,
would you mind telling us

1604
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:32,140
about your association
with Bud Monckton?

1605
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:35,178
Well, I wouldn't call it
an association exactly.

1606
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:37,178
I hired him to do
a job for me.

1607
01:18:37,246 --> 01:18:38,304
And the last time
I talked to him,

1608
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,643
he told me he had
the information I needed,

1609
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,275
but before
he could deliver it,

1610
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:45,150
this terrible thing happened.

1611
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,616
I take it
you're close friends?

1612
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,385
Oh, not really close.

1613
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,550
(LAUGHING)

1614
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,390
Not really friends,
actually.

1615
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,863
Well, both Mr. Monckton and
Mr. Rockford were private investigators,

1616
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,629
so that just naturally gave
them a commonality of interest.

1617
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:02,364
Well, I can certainly understand
how Mr. Rockford fits into the picture,

1618
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,065
but Miss Wilding,
I hope you'll forgive me,

1619
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:06,335
your place in it
somewhat eludes me.

1620
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,673
If the CIA budget is out of
balance with the Congress,

1621
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,578
I don't quite see how
the IRS gets into it.

1622
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,807
CIA?

1623
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:14,906
(CHUCKLES) Not that
we wouldn't welcome

1624
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,884
all the help we can get,
you understand.

1625
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,353
Excuse me.
You said the CIA.

1626
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,753
Well, a proprietary
for the CIA.

1627
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:24,555
Felicidad Records
is a front.

1628
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,459
A prime example,
as far as I'm concerned,

1629
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,930
of unnecessary
government expenditure.

1630
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:32,661
They set up these
front organizations,

1631
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:34,134
and they never
pull the plug on them,

1632
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:37,696
and you and I have to go on
paying for that with our tax dollars

1633
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,174
for the rest of
our natural lives.

1634
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:42,939
I was elected on a platform
of fiscal responsibility,

1635
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:45,208
and I'm damned well
gonna follow through on that.

1636
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,511
Bud Monckton was investigating

1637
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,416
Felicidad Records on your
behalf to put them out of business?

1638
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:51,681
That's right.

1639
01:19:51,754 --> 01:19:55,452
And I could have, too, with the
information he promised me in his report.

1640
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,959
Names, dates...

1641
01:19:58,027 --> 01:20:00,962
All the figures we weren't
able to get a hold of ourselves.

1642
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,522
All the information,
all the facts that we needed

1643
01:20:03,599 --> 01:20:05,931
that we couldn't get
our hands on before.

1644
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,197
Incredible waste there.

1645
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,170
Have you ever seen
their offices?

1646
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,139
(LAUGHING) I'm a
United States Senator.

1647
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:16,769
I don't have an office anywhere
close to what Hector Gustavo has.

1648
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,138
You know,
I've been going crazy

1649
01:20:19,214 --> 01:20:22,343
trying to figure out what this
is all about, and it's so simple.

1650
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,488
It's the American Dream.

1651
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,683
JESS: How can you say
a thing like that?

1652
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,487
The American Dream?

1653
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,426
I mean, Bud Monckton
was killed,

1654
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,485
you were charged
with murder.

1655
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:36,588
You could have spent the
rest of your life in prison.

1656
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,999
There is a potential for
corruption in anything, Jess.

1657
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:42,504
Even when it's painted red,
white and blue.

1658
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:46,269
Nothing sinister about
the dream or the good life.

1659
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,312
It's what some people will do to
achieve it you have to worry about,

1660
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:52,040
and how far they'll go
not to lose it.

1661
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,138
I'm afraid I have
a problem with this.

1662
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,277
They just can't get by
with what they've done.

1663
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,323
You thinking along the lines
of yearly audits?

1664
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,255
If that's the best I can do.

1665
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,554
Oh, I think we can do
better than that.

1666
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:12,824
Hey, what the hell is...
Hey! What...

1667
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:13,925
How many times
you been shot

1668
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:15,094
for making a dumb move
like that?

1669
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:17,434
I'm sorry, Dennis,
I didn't mean to freak you out.

1670
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:20,373
I just wanted to check with you
one more time before you go in there.

1671
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,103
So you've checked.

1672
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,168
Are you sure you know
what you're gonna do?

1673
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,078
Not really. In situations
where I can lose

1674
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:29,083
both pension and credibility,
I'm more into improv.

1675
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:30,516
Okay, okay.

1676
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:42,061
Lieutenant Becker,
we have all been the souls of cooperation,

1677
01:21:42,131 --> 01:21:43,621
as far as I'm concerned.

1678
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,531
We've made our statements.

1679
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:48,093
I don't know why you need
anything further from us.

1680
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:51,470
I'm investigating the murder of
an employee of yours, Mr. Gustavo.

1681
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,099
Surely, you want us
to find the killer.

1682
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:54,802
But you have.

1683
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:58,211
That private investigator,
James Rockford.

1684
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,180
It's been on the news,
in the paper.

1685
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,808
Yeah, but you haven't
read the latest edition.

1686
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:04,581
We thought we had a case,
it fell apart on us.

1687
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,849
So now, we're back
to square one,

1688
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,222
so we're going to do things
a little bit differently this time.

1689
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,384
Is everybody here?

1690
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,586
'Cause I want everyone.

1691
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,255
Receptionists, secretaries,
maintenance, security.

1692
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,163
Anybody that works
for Felicidad, in here.

1693
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,257
Why?

1694
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,597
Because I'm running
an investigation.

1695
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,001
And that's the way
I want to do it.

1696
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,130
All right,
but we have to leave somebody on security.

1697
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,437
Won't be necessary, sir.
My men will make sure

1698
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:30,206
that nobody goes in
and out of those offices

1699
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:32,407
till your people
are back in place.

1700
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:36,352
Now, I'm on a very tight schedule,
Mr. Gustavo.

1701
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:39,513
I'd like to get out of here
as soon as possible.

1702
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,756

will be very, very simple...

taking their buddies along on busts.

Dennis.

finds that out...

1714
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:27,447
He won't.

1715
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:30,753
You got an anonymous tip,
you got a court order, you found the tapes.

1728
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:10,958
having a regular table for lunch,

want to put you out of business?

to tie a can to you.

Yet, we all know
right where to find you.

1735

You can leave voluntarily,
Mr. Rockford,

1736
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:30,810
or I can have you removed.

1737
01:26:30,886 --> 01:26:32,354
That always looks so awkward.

1738
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:34,549
You know what
your major mistake was?

1739
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:36,216
You fell in love
with your front.

That's all the record company
was meant to be.

1741

It gave you
a legitimate excuse

01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:41,661
to run around Latin America,

But show business
is very seductive.

01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:52,801
You liked playing record mogul

a lot more than
you were supposed to.

Well, I'm here to

01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,745
You killed Monckton
for nothing.

1751
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:07,153

his report, he couldn't close you down.

Well, he doesn't have to.

Sure, you did.
You're amoral thugs.

that he hung on you.

1771
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,473
Bugs. That was his obsession.

1772
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,671
And the rumor is you didn't
find everything he hung on you.

1773
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,680
The rumor is the cops found
a secret stash of tapes

1774

that have you plotting his murder,
plotting my frame.

called first. Sorry.

you've never come out and said so,

there was between Rocky and me.

No, no, I don't.

1801
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,991
About six years ago, I...

1802
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:11,300
I walked away from a fairly
disastrous relationship.

1803
01:30:11,373 --> 01:30:13,341
And unfortunately,
when I walked away,

1804
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,867
I was left with this
very fragile ego,

1805
01:30:16,945 --> 01:30:22,679
and this inability to trust anyone,
and so much anger.

1806
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,845
But, you know,
Rocky was so...

1807
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:33,089
He was so warm, and funny,
and infinitely patient, and he healed me.

1808
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:40,225
He was... He was the
grandfather that I never even knew.

1809
01:30:41,236 --> 01:30:44,331
He was my dad that I lost
when I was 12 years old.

of my life for the rest of my life.

how to fish.

Hope you don't mind.

1816
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,887
I mean, he let me think of
myself as part of his family.

1817
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,298
But you...

1818
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,969
You were the center
of his universe, Jim.

1819
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,973
That never changed.

1820
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:23,102
There was never a moment in
his life when you didn't come first.

1821
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,680
I have a feeling that
you were a very close second.
