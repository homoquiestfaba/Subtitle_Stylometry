Mrs. Kennedy?

5
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:20,149
They told me to come up.

6
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,002
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

7
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:27,536
Have you read what they've been writing?

8
00:02:27,644 --> 00:02:30,481
Krock and Merriman and all the rest?

9
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,596
Yes, I have.

10
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:36,279
Merriman is such a bitter man.

11
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,983
It's been just one week.

12
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,173
Already they're treating him
like some dusty old artifact,

13
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,711
to be shelved away.

14
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,278
That's no way to be remembered.

15
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:49,637
And how would you like him
remembered, Mrs. Kennedy?

16
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:50,857
(STAMMERS) I...

17
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:55,671
You understand that I will
be editing this conversation?

18

Just in case I don't
say exactly what I mean.

19
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:00,852
With all due respect,

20
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,179
that seems very unlikely, Mrs. Kennedy.

21
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:12,214
(CHUCKLES) Right. Okay. Uh...

22
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:17,621
So, this will be your own
version of what happened?

23
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,443
Exactly.

24
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:21,738
Come in.

25
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:29,169
I thought it was another backfire.

26
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,147
I very nearly didn't
go. What if I'd been here

27
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:36,839
or out riding in Virginia somewhere?

28
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,168
Thank God I was with him.

29
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,672
Why, "Thank God"?

30
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,867
Do you know what I think of history?

31
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:49,544
Of history?

32
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,947
I've read a great deal.
More than people realize.

When something is written down,

35
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:58,056
does that make it true?

36
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,405
It's all that we have.

37
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Had.

38
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,407
We have television now.

39
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,899
At least people can see for their own eyes.

40
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:06,883
That tour of the White House

41
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:08,833
that you did a couple of years ago for CBS,

42
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,626
I always assumed that you did that for

43
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,256
a purpose? No? After the fashion magazines?

44
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,002
You even won an Emmy.

45
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,714
I didn't do that program for me.

46
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:22,333
I did it for the American people.

47
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,842
That program was my first glimpse

48
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,709
into the White House

49
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:27,323
and, for whatever it's worth,
I thought you were excellent.

50
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:28,610
- Very poised.
- Oh, thank you.

51
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,415
You could have had a career
as a broadcaster, I'm sure.

52
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:33,403
What?

53
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,203
I'm sorry?

54
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:38,941
What did you say?

55
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,655
I said you could have
a career... (CHUCKLES)

56
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:43,303
Could have had a career as a broadcaster.

57
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:45,739

00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,313

They want to hear from you.

73
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:30,245
They think I'm a fool.

74
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:32,366
One year in office, wasting their money.

75
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:35,584
That's why you need to
show them what you've done.

you in the Monroe Room

I wait for the Lord, my soul waits,

540
00:34:45,412 --> 00:34:48,314

541

My soul waits for the Lord

542
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:54,475
more than watchmen wait for the morning.

O Israel, put your hope in the Lord,

544

Excuse me, Mother. Jackie.

Have you started on the
guest list for the burial?

You'll need to pare it down, dear.

550

We can't possibly accommodate
all these people at Brookline.

551

VALENTI: (SOFTLY) Mr. Kennedy, we
need to discuss the funeral, sir.

552
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:51,606
We all want to follow her lead,

553
00:35:51,668 --> 00:35:53,545
but we still don't know
much about this Oswald.

554
00:35:53,605 --> 00:35:55,784
There may be co-conspirators.

555
00:35:56,957 --> 00:36:00,176
I'll talk to her, but she makes the call.

556
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:02,670
There's also the matter of the Oval.

557
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:06,472
What do you want me to do first?

558
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:09,013
Hmm? Plan the funeral
or pack the furniture?

559
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,343
I know this is all delicate.

560
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,681
That's why I'm approaching you.

561
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:13,905
But a procession is insane.

The family plot.

564
00:36:19,575 --> 00:36:22,708
Well, I assume Jack will be
buried with the rest of us.

565
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,583
A crowd full of people,
given what's happened,

566
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:26,894
I just can't have my President walking.

567
00:36:26,968 --> 00:36:29,437
- Your President?
- My President.

Fuck off, Jack.

JANET: Averell Harriman owns

574
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,526
at least four properties in Georgetown.

575
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:55,094
I'm sure he could loan out one of them.

577
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,262
I'm sure we have time.

578
00:36:58,307 --> 00:37:00,766
They can't expect us to
move immediately, can they?

579

And the Van Burens and the Tylers, too.

584
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,312
She auctioned it off, piece by piece,

585
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,336

00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:26,635
Remember? Bill and I,

589
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,273
we had to haggle over
every sofa, every chair.

590
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,742
If I sell some of it back now,

591
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:36,714
maybe I can put John and
Caroline through school.

<i>in the Lincoln Room?</i>

607
00:38:18,821 --> 00:38:21,177
JACKIE: It was where we
lived when we first came here,

608
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,913
when our rooms at the other end of the hall

609
00:38:22,948 --> 00:38:24,120
were being painted.

610
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:24,966
COLLINGWOOD: It's a nice room.

611
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,623
Was this a bedroom during Lincoln's time?

612
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,601
JACKIE: <i>No, it was, uh,
Lincoln's Cabinet Room.</i>

613
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:31,479
COLLINGWOOD: <i>Are all the pieces</i>

614
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:32,990
<i>from Lincoln's time?</i>

615
00:38:35,032 --> 00:38:36,882
JACKIE: Uh, yes, they are.

616
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:40,495
The most famous one, of
course, is the Lincoln bed.

617
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,599
It was bought by Mrs. Lincoln,

618
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,437
along with the dressing bureaus

619
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,179
and chair, and this table.

620
00:38:47,214 --> 00:38:50,238
<i>Um, she bought a lot of
furniture for this house,</i>

621
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,240
<i>which made her husband rather cross</i>

622
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,092
<i>because he thought she
spent too much money.</i>

623
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:04,974
<i>And on the table is
the Gettysburg Address.</i>

624
00:39:05,102 --> 00:39:08,639
<i>This is probably the greatest
treasure in this room.</i>

625
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:13,122
<i>And this sofa and these two chairs,</i>

626
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:15,604

630
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,172

631
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:24,735

750
00:48:41,014 --> 00:48:43,290

752
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,902

00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:51,123
"that Jack wasn't perfect,

Perfect people can't change.

758
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:02,108
Jack was always getting better,

759
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:03,502
stronger.

760
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:08,385
Sometimes he would walk
into the desert alone,

761
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:11,918
just to let himself be
tempted by the devil.

762
00:49:12,946 --> 00:49:15,181
But he'd always come back to us,

763
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,196
his beloved family.

764
00:49:19,928 --> 00:49:21,596

765
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:23,803
And I don't smoke.

766
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:29,970
JACKIE: I shouldn't say these things.

767
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:34,667
PRIEST: That's why we're here, isn't it?

768
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:36,700
To talk about what happened?

769
00:49:38,352 --> 00:49:39,931
Is this a confession?

770
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:42,523
Only if there's something you regret.

771
00:49:43,363 --> 00:49:45,432
Everyone knows my story.

772
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,765
God isn't interested in stories.

773
00:49:49,405 --> 00:49:51,486
He's interested in the truth.

774
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:55,929
I came here looking for sympathy, Father.

775
00:49:57,818 --> 00:49:59,287
Of course.

776
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:02,838
Father, are you listening?

777
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:05,304
I'm listening.

778
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:08,029
Yes, I think so.

779
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,304
I think God is cruel.

780
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:16,453
Well, now you're getting into trouble.

781
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,736
God is love.

782
00:50:22,759 --> 00:50:24,494
And God is everywhere.

783
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:27,456
Was he in the bullet that killed Jack?

784
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,227
Absolutely.

785
00:50:30,454 --> 00:50:32,690
Is he inside me now?

786
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,689
Yes, of course. Of course he is.

787
00:50:35,626 --> 00:50:37,639
Well, that's a funny game he plays,

788
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:39,128
hiding all the time.

789
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:40,830
(CHUCKLING) The fact that
we don't understand him

790
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,411
isn't funny at all.

791
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,007
If there's a heaven, then there's your God,

792
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,310
with all his empty promises.

793
00:50:48,538 --> 00:50:49,871
What kind of God takes a father

794
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:51,825
from his two little children?

795
00:50:51,993 --> 00:50:54,430
Thy Lord sacrificed his only son...

796
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:56,300
And my two babies.

797
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,348
Arabella in the womb.

798
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:00,985
And Patrick. Thirty-nine hours on Earth.

799
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:03,453
Just long enough to fall in love with him.

800
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,576
What did I do to deserve that?

801
00:51:07,377 --> 00:51:08,513
Nothing.

802
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:13,730
Jack and I hardly ever
spent the night together.

803
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:16,721
Not even that last night in Fort Worth.

804
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:20,927
Your husband loved you,
Mrs. Kennedy. I'm sure of it.

805
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:24,535
I seem to remember there
being more to our vows.

806
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,612
Don't look at me like that.

807
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:31,412
I was First Lady of the United States.

808
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,586
Women have endured far worse for far less.

809
00:51:35,365 --> 00:51:36,987
There are two kinds of women.

810
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:38,828
Those who want power in the world,

811
00:51:38,898 --> 00:51:41,783
and those who want power in bed.

812
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:46,809
(CHUCKLES) Of course,
now what am I left with?

813
00:51:49,552 --> 00:51:52,680
When men see me now, what
do you think they feel?

814
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,972
Sadness.

815
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,162
Compassion.

816
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:02,592
Desire, maybe.

817
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:05,325
You're still a young woman, Mrs. Kennedy.

818
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:08,923
I used to make them smile.

819
00:52:14,405 --> 00:52:17,639
No one understands the pain he was in

820
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:19,226
and how loyal he was.

821
00:52:19,288 --> 00:52:21,858
Just some of his friends were so crude.

822
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,521
Jack wasn't, of course.

823
00:52:25,556 --> 00:52:27,625
But he could get caught up in it.

824
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:33,327
Still, he was a great father.

825
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:36,895
I picture him on that
rocking chair in his office,

826
00:52:36,975 --> 00:52:39,282
Caroline and John at his feet.

827
00:52:40,275 --> 00:52:42,013
How could I hate him?

828
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,650
Take comfort in those memories.

829
00:52:47,157 --> 00:52:48,425

00:53:49,052 --> 00:53:49,621
I don't know.

853

Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

I used to worry that you
might be jealous of me.

Oh, stop it.

860
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,826
No, you never did anything
to make me feel that way.

861
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:18,704
But I worried. After I married Jack.

862
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:20,691
After he won the election.

863
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:24,032

895
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,506

down. I'm told any moment.

<i>To Dallas, Texas, and Tom Pettit.</i>

00:55:50,203 --> 00:55:52,226
PETTIT: <i>There's the prisoner.</i>

900
00:55:52,445 --> 00:55:54,148
<i>There is Lee Oswald.</i>

901
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:56,605
- (GUNSHOT)
- (OSWALD GROANS)

902
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:59,182
<i>He's been shot. He's been shot.</i>

903
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:01,333
<i>Lee Oswald has been shot.</i>

904
00:56:01,452 --> 00:56:03,881
- <i>There's a man with a gun.</i>
- (SOFTLY) Jesus Christ.

905
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:05,370
Are you ready to go?

906
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:06,652
Yeah.

907
00:56:07,873 --> 00:56:09,111
Will you look at me?

908
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:12,008
Mommy, is it my birthday?

909
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:13,212
Not yet, dear.

910
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:16,921
But why am I wearing my party clothes?

911
00:56:18,996 --> 00:56:20,565
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

912
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:23,212
Special Agent Hill.

913
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:25,182
Whenever Mrs. Kennedy is ready.

914
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,627
Oh, Clint.

915
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,436
We're nearly done here.

916
00:56:36,745 --> 00:56:38,904
It's the strangest thing.

917
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,146
I hardly remember anything after.

918
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:45,919
But I read about what
you did in the papers,

919
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,050
and I just wanted to thank you.

920
00:56:48,123 --> 00:56:49,288
We got to get a handle on this thing.

921
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:51,025
- We got to get involved.
- Yes, sir.

922
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:55,873
This is making us look like
a bunch of goddamn barbarians.

923
00:56:55,908 --> 00:56:59,300
Mrs. Kennedy is on her
way down with the children.

924
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,904
Turn the television off!

925
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,281
You're not to speak a word of this.

926
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:09,580
Understood? I'll tell Jackie
when the time is right.

927
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:11,859
Sit down.

928
00:57:13,115 --> 00:57:14,917
Excuse me?

929
00:57:14,983 --> 00:57:16,785
Sit down.

930
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,089
LADY BIRD: Darling?

931
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:25,965
What do you remember? Will
you tell me everything?

932
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,438
I need to hear.

933
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:29,109
Mrs. Kennedy...

934
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,262
I was ten yards back when
I heard the first shot.

935
00:57:35,697 --> 00:57:37,986
And as my eyes crossed
the President's car...

936
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:43,238
(SIGHS DEEPLY) Mrs. Kennedy...

937
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:46,214
Keep going.

938
00:57:46,334 --> 00:57:50,192
I had to get to you,
put myself between you,

939
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:52,141
the President, and the shooter.

940
00:57:52,193 --> 00:57:53,537
JACKIE: Who was it?

941
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:56,446
Was it that Oswald?

942
00:57:56,481 --> 00:57:57,706
(SIGHS) They think so.

943
00:57:57,763 --> 00:57:59,288
I need to talk to him.

944
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:01,604
Uh...

945
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:03,207
I need to talk to him.

946
00:58:04,867 --> 00:58:09,034
I don't... I don't know
about that, Mrs. Kennedy.

947
00:58:13,307 --> 00:58:14,431
NANCY: The children are ready.

948
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,210
Shall I take them
downstairs to ride with Maud?

949
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:19,162
I would like them to come with me.

950
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:20,706
But the press is out front...

951
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:23,727
Their father is leaving
this house for the last time.

952
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,983
They should be there to say goodbye to him.

953
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:27,254
But the cameras.

954
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:28,630
Those pictures are being broadcast

955
00:58:28,677 --> 00:58:30,142
to every corner of the world.

956
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:33,302
Those pictures should record the truth.

957
00:58:33,394 --> 00:58:34,745
Two heartbroken,

958
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:37,358
fatherless children are part of that.

959
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:41,020
You can tell them I'm ready to leave,

960
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,457
with Caroline and John.

961
00:58:42,492 --> 00:58:43,692
Yes, Mrs. Kennedy.

962
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:45,473
- Nancy?
- Yes?

963
00:58:45,508 --> 00:58:47,886
I'm not the First Lady anymore.

964
00:58:48,343 --> 00:58:50,173
You can call me Jackie.

965
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:52,327
I will.

966
00:58:56,503 --> 00:58:59,782
Caroline, are you ready, sweetheart?

967
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,702
My brave girl.

968
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,602
(JOHN JR. CRYING)

969
00:59:04,637 --> 00:59:07,192
Oh, John, John, John.

970
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:09,033
Let me take you, son.

971
00:59:10,324 --> 00:59:12,332
JACKIE: <i>I value my privacy.</i>

972
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,568
I always have.

973
00:59:13,614 --> 00:59:15,227
And yet, in the days after,

974
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,798
directly after, something seemed to change.

975
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,022
In what way?

976
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:20,013
Before the funeral,

977
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,660
the day you moved the
casket to the Capitol,

978
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:25,276
well, your children were on full display

979
00:59:25,364 --> 00:59:26,944
for the whole world to see.

980
00:59:27,012 --> 00:59:28,612
Well, what are you insinuating,

981
00:59:28,683 --> 00:59:29,672
that I exploited them?

982
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:32,167
Oh, no, of course not. I just, um...

983
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:38,225
OFFICER: Present arms!

984
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:09,406
JOURNALIST: <i>I'm only
wondering if you ever</i>

985
01:00:09,494 --> 01:00:11,762
considered to do more to shield them.

986
01:00:11,836 --> 01:00:14,458
I think that most people would have...

987
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:17,510
We aren't most people.

988
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,639
Most people don't have to
make decisions like that,

989
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:22,355
hours after watching
their husband get murdered

990
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,734
next to them.

991
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,269
Oh, Lyndon.

992
01:00:34,162 --> 01:00:37,232
What an awful way to begin your presidency.

993
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:04,710
Are you saying it was a mistake?

994
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:08,297
No, of course not.

995
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:33,580
JACKIE: How dare you?

996
01:01:33,722 --> 01:01:35,783
They murdered him inside the jail.

997
01:01:36,084 --> 01:01:38,319
These people can get to anyone.

998
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,422
How dare you keep that from me?

999
01:01:40,476 --> 01:01:41,845
You had no right! The children?

1000
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:43,009
The ceremony at the Capitol...

1001
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:44,201
I took them out the front door.

1002
01:01:44,248 --> 01:01:45,633
- Are you...
- This is all insanity!

1003
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:46,487
You and your brother.

1004
01:01:46,522 --> 01:01:48,733
All these years, all your goddamn secrets!

1005
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:50,925
- That's not fair...
- Caroline and John are all I have left,

1006
01:01:50,985 --> 01:01:53,303
and I put them in danger because of you.

1007
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:55,247
I would never put you at risk.

1008
01:01:55,342 --> 01:01:56,880
You can't know that!

1009
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,948
You think you all control everything,

1010
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:01,493
that you have the world on puppet strings.

1011
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:05,565
And you're ridiculous. And
I let myself believe it.

1012
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:08,295
And this parade? Who is it really for?

1013
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:09,536
For Jack?

1014
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:12,918
One more campaign stop
along the way to the grave?

1015
01:02:13,299 --> 01:02:15,268
Lyndon's people are right.

1016
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:16,323
It's not worth it.

1017
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:18,225
It's not worth risking people's lives.

1018
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:20,245
You tell them we're calling it off.

1019
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:21,900
We'll motorcade to the Cathedral.

1020
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:22,970
The back way.

1021
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,256
And then we'll bury him, and
we put an end to all this.

1022
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:27,329
I don't give a damn anymore.

1023
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,977
I don't.

1024
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:31,080
I would never put you and
the children in danger.

1025
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:34,362
I know you think I'm some
silly little debutante.

1026
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,195
- Listen to me.
- You don't protect me anymore.

1027
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:38,618
I would never put you and
the children in danger.

1028
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,535
You don't know anything.

1029
01:02:48,408 --> 01:02:53,138
I lie awake at night,
and all I can think is

1030
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:54,887
I should have been a shop girl

1031
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,375
or a stenographer.

1032
01:02:56,483 --> 01:03:01,728
I should have married an
ordinary, lazy, ugly man.

1033
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,085
Let me share with you a parable.

1034
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,529
Jesus

1035
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,607
once passed a blind beggar on the road,

1036
01:03:21,795 --> 01:03:25,343
and his disciples asked, "Who sinned,

1037
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:28,679
"this man or his parents,
that he should be born blind?"

1038
01:03:28,748 --> 01:03:30,884
And Jesus said,

1039
01:03:30,991 --> 01:03:34,472
"Neither this man nor his parents sinned.

1040
01:03:35,593 --> 01:03:37,283
"He was made blind

1041
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:40,459
"so that the works of God
could be revealed in him."

1042
01:03:41,392 --> 01:03:44,495
And with that, he placed mud on his eyes

1043
01:03:44,691 --> 01:03:47,929
and told him to wash in the Pool of Siloam.

1044
01:03:50,336 --> 01:03:53,706
And the man did, and he came back seeing.

1045
01:03:55,714 --> 01:03:57,601
Right now you are blind.

1046
01:03:57,678 --> 01:03:58,726
Not because you've sinned,

1047
01:03:58,761 --> 01:04:00,997
but because you've been chosen.

1048
01:04:02,695 --> 01:04:06,140
So that the works of God
can be revealed in you.

1049
01:04:14,462 --> 01:04:16,411
It's perfect.

1050
01:04:16,487 --> 01:04:18,793
We installed it while you were away.

1051
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:20,146
I thought it'd be a nice surprise

1052
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:21,046
for you and the President.

1053
01:04:21,081 --> 01:04:22,784
It changes everything.

1054
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:26,080
And the Treaty Room?

1055
01:04:26,115 --> 01:04:27,572
Hunter green.

1056
01:04:27,713 --> 01:04:29,616
Exactly as you imagined it.

1057
01:04:30,821 --> 01:04:32,423
I wish Jack...

1058
01:04:33,947 --> 01:04:36,282
Who knows if he would have cared?

1059
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:40,581
I lost track, somewhere...

1060
01:04:42,362 --> 01:04:43,964
What was real.

1061
01:04:45,859 --> 01:04:47,862
What was performance.

1062
01:04:48,027 --> 01:04:50,931
Well, he was a president.

1063
01:04:51,085 --> 01:04:52,696
You were right earlier.

1064
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:56,563
I'm not going to march tomorrow.

1065
01:04:56,882 --> 01:05:00,153
I won't put people in danger
on account of my vanity.

1066
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:03,375
I was scared for you. I still am.

1067
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,130
But I never thought it was vanity.

1068
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:07,879
You know, that's what Jack called all this.

1069
01:05:07,974 --> 01:05:10,299
When he saw what we were spending, he said,

1070
01:05:13,097 --> 01:05:14,658

I'm sorry, Bobby.

1094
01:07:11,907 --> 01:07:14,442
Do you think Lincoln's widow knew?

1095
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:17,186
What?

1096
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:20,108
That we'd build a monument to her husband?

1097
01:07:22,665 --> 01:07:25,696
Why is this room so peaceful?

1098
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,964
"Peaceful"? I don't know.

1099
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,398
Every time I walk by this room,

1100
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:35,523
I'm reminded that on January 1st, 1863,

1101
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:38,870
an ordinary man signed a document

1102
01:07:38,964 --> 01:07:41,635
that freed four million
people from slavery.

1103
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:44,400
So,

1104
01:07:46,015 --> 01:07:49,318
I don't think of it so much as peaceful

1105
01:07:50,585 --> 01:07:53,634
as a place of profound legacy.

1106
01:07:55,647 --> 01:07:58,861
And it's too bad that ours
is totally fucking wasted.

1107
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:00,126
Bobby!

1108
01:08:01,622 --> 01:08:02,823
What?

1109
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,119
Bobby, watch your mouth.

1110
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:08,332
What did we accomplish, huh?

1111
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,691
We're just... We're just

Right? Isn't that what we are?

1113
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:14,758
- Bobby.
- Because what did we...

1114
01:08:14,793 --> 01:08:17,656
What did we truly accomplish?

1115
01:08:18,863 --> 01:08:19,881
Maybe Jack will be remembered

1116
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:21,389
for the way he handled the missile crisis,

1117
01:08:21,424 --> 01:08:22,872
or maybe he'll be remembered

1118
01:08:22,907 --> 01:08:24,335
for having created a crisis

1119
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,473
that he was then forced to solve.

1126
01:08:49,634 --> 01:08:52,569
I shouldn't have pushed
him so hard on Castro.

Of course you are.

1140
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,525
I remember when we won the election.

1141
01:11:25,599 --> 01:11:26,973
It was so overwhelming.

1142
01:11:27,047 --> 01:11:28,162
We're doing just fine.

Oh, that's very kind of you.

1145
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:36,403
I've come to discuss tomorrow.

1146
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:38,424
The Attorney General
relayed to me your desire

1147
01:11:38,484 --> 01:11:39,984
for a more modest ceremony.

1148
01:11:40,019 --> 01:11:41,556
I've changed my mind.

1149
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:43,275
I'm sorry?

1150
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:45,296
I said I've changed my mind.

1151
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:46,873
We will have a procession,

1152
01:11:46,964 --> 01:11:48,476
and I will walk to the Cathedral

1153
01:11:48,534 --> 01:11:49,900
with the casket.

1154
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:54,701
Well, even if we could
resume the arrangements,

1155
01:11:54,755 --> 01:11:55,848
I'm sure you can understand

1156
01:11:55,883 --> 01:11:57,956
the Secret Service
still has their concerns.

1157
01:11:58,004 --> 01:11:59,635
And President Johnson?

1158
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:00,865
President Johnson would like nothing more

1159
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,101
than to fulfill your wishes,

1160
01:12:02,162 --> 01:12:04,463
but I have to take into account his safety.

1161
01:12:04,507 --> 01:12:06,079

1162
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,232

It's not the same.

If it were up to him,

1165
01:12:13,268 --> 01:12:16,006
he'd do anything that
might bring you comfort.

1166
01:12:16,057 --> 01:12:18,812
Then who is it up to, Mr. Valenti?

1167
01:12:18,877 --> 01:12:19,819
Well, as I'm sure you know,

1168
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:22,422
tomorrow we're expecting
close to 100 Heads of State.

1169
01:12:22,495 --> 01:12:24,097
One-hundred three.

1170
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:25,454
Yes, I'm sure that's right.

1171
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,906
And I suspect they'll make
all their own decisions.

1172
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:30,342
Based on what?

1173
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:34,257
There's a great deal of
classified intelligence

1174
01:12:34,335 --> 01:12:36,162
that I just can't get into.

1175
01:12:38,032 --> 01:12:40,345
We've intercepted a threat
against General de Gaulle

1176
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,167
from our assets in Geneva.

1177
01:12:42,261 --> 01:12:45,463
I'm afraid if he refuses
to march, others may follow.

1178
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:49,243
I understand.

1179
01:12:49,457 --> 01:12:50,582
As I said, Mrs. Kennedy,

1180
01:12:50,642 --> 01:12:51,668
I wish there were more we could do

1181
01:12:51,763 --> 01:12:53,331
to accommodate your wishes.

1182
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,739
I'm terribly sorry.

1183
01:12:54,821 --> 01:12:56,056
Don't be.

1184
01:12:56,183 --> 01:12:58,721
You and the Johnsons
have already done so much.

1185
01:12:58,790 --> 01:12:59,543
Good day, Mrs. Kennedy.

1186
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:01,286
Um, Mr. Valenti.

1187
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:02,852
Would you mind getting a message

1188
01:13:02,913 --> 01:13:05,751
to all our funeral guests when they land?

1189
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,250
Of course.

1190
01:13:07,285 --> 01:13:10,674
Inform them that I will
walk with Jack tomorrow.

1191
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:13,299
Alone, if necessary.

1192
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:16,281
And tell General de Gaulle

1193
01:13:16,377 --> 01:13:19,001
that if he wishes to ride in an armored car

1194
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:21,172
or in a tank for that matter,

1195
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:23,150
I won't blame him.

1196
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,229
And I'm sure the tens of millions of people

1197
01:13:25,304 --> 01:13:27,257
watching won't either.

1198
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,702
Why are you doing this, Mrs. Kennedy?

1199
01:13:29,763 --> 01:13:33,324
Oh, I'm just doing my job.

1200
01:13:41,678 --> 01:13:43,437
Would you like to write this down?

1201
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:46,521
- Do you think I should?
- I...

1202
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:47,817
I do.

1203
01:13:54,948 --> 01:13:58,651
We all live on far after our deaths.

1204
01:13:59,927 --> 01:14:02,207
Presidents will come and go,

1205
01:14:03,435 --> 01:14:05,429
and every one of them

1206
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,788
will look up to Jack for guidance,

1207
01:14:08,854 --> 01:14:10,222
for inspiration.

1208
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:16,072
What do you say to those
who say he didn't deserve it?

1209
01:14:16,746 --> 01:14:19,275
The scale of it. I mean,
he was a great president,

1210
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:22,447
but he didn't win the
Civil War, for instance.

1211
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:24,192
It was a funeral for

1212
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:26,528
the President of the United States.

1213
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:29,649
Your husband drove cars,
he didn't ride horses.

1214
01:14:29,684 --> 01:14:31,211
Yes, and there should
have been more of them.

1215
01:14:31,278 --> 01:14:32,580
There should be more horses,

1216
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:36,357
more soldiers, more crying, more cameras!

1217
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:46,576
I'm guessing you won't allow
me to write any of that.

1218
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,831
No,

1219
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:51,486
because I never said that.

1220
01:14:55,021 --> 01:14:59,259
Perhaps Jack didn't have
time to defeat Communism,

1221
01:15:00,637 --> 01:15:02,244
but I do seem to recall...

1222
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,644
With all due respect,

1223
01:15:03,741 --> 01:15:06,444
you were at the center
of it all, Mrs. Kennedy,

1224
01:15:06,499 --> 01:15:09,016
and I'd imagine it's impossible

1225
01:15:09,056 --> 01:15:11,368
to have any perspective
from that vantage point.

1226
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:15,428
But I can assure you
that it was a spectacle.

1227
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:30,836
JACKIE: <i>Nancy said they
wanted to share my grief,</i>

1228
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,658
<i>so I let them.</i>

1229
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:37,902
But after, I realized
that all the pageantry,

1230
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,796
all the demands I made to honor him,

1231
01:16:41,508 --> 01:16:44,577
it wasn't for Jack or his legacy.

1232
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,261
It was for me.

1233
01:17:38,623 --> 01:17:40,091
(INAUDIBLE)

1234
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:49,558
JACKIE: <i>I wrote him a letter.</i>

1235
01:17:50,411 --> 01:17:54,281
<i>That night, before we moved
the casket to the Capitol.</i>

1236
01:17:54,382 --> 01:17:56,233
<i>Do you know what I wrote?</i>

1237
01:17:56,295 --> 01:17:58,463
That I wanted to die.

1238
01:17:58,658 --> 01:18:00,480
- I understand.
- Do you?

1239
01:18:00,532 --> 01:18:02,334
I do.

1240
01:18:02,821 --> 01:18:06,425
Unless you are asking my permission.

1241
01:18:06,492 --> 01:18:07,740
No, only crass,

1242
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,735
self-indulgent people kill themselves.

1243
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:12,899
No, I was just hoping that if I walked

1244
01:18:12,934 --> 01:18:15,008
down the street next to Jack's body,

1245
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:18,083
maybe someone would be
kind enough to do it for me.

1246
01:18:18,157 --> 01:18:20,362
In front of the whole world?

1247
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:23,244
