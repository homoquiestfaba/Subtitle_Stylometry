[Narrating]
My name's Benny Silman...

2
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,679
and this is probably
the worst day of my young life.

3
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,618
You know, there's nothing
like the taste of your own blood...

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,713
to start you thinking
about the beginning--

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,020
things you maybe
could have done differently.

6
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,619
Me? I grew up like
any other kid did in New York.

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,096
I learned how to break dance
when it was cool.

8
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,325
I played stickball.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,391
I even sold lemonade
on street corners.

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,868
You name it.
I had dreams--

11
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:40,633
Ideas of what I wanted
to do with my life.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,197
You could say
I had a future.

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,573
But by the time
I was a senior in college...

14
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:48,011
the FBI was calling me
a criminal mastermind.

15
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,016
Strangely enough, all of this
could have been avoided...

16
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,279
if I had just listened
to my mother.

17
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,980
This is a very bad idea.

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,182
Ma, what do you-- Why--

19
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,281
I just don't understand
why you have to go to school...

20
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,484
so far from home.

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,049
Because I'm--
How many times I gotta tell you?

22
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,219
Take these.

23
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,728
It's just something
I gotta do, Ma.

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,288
It's just--
I gotta get outta here.

25
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,596
Ma, it's like--
Just something different.

26
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:10,158
Did you wanna pack
the menorah?

27
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,636
Yeah, I'm not gonna forget
the mini-menorah.

28
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,899
I'm-- Look.

29
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,168
There it is.

30
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,370
So, you're all set.

31
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,214
Don't cry, Mommy.

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,187
Shh.

[ Sniffles ]

34
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,722
You're my whole world,
honey.

35
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,489
Look at that. I'm gonna
miss that face so much.

36
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,860
I'm gonna miss this face.

37
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,161
I still don't understand
what is so special...

38
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,396
about this Arizona State.
What? What?

39
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,244
#All right, dig it #

40
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,949
My moms couldn't understand
why her only son...

41
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,456
would travel all the way across
the country to go to college...

42
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,322
but what I couldn't
really explain to her...

43
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,827
was that for a kid like me
from New York...

44
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,523
going to Arizona State
was like...

45
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,624
stepping into
a Coppertone commercial.

46
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,568
See what I'm talking about?

47
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,298
I mean, it had everything
that New York didn't:

48
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,067
the sun, the fun, the hotties.

49
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,047
Remember that feeling
after a long winter...

50
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,983
when you could finally wear your
shorts outside for the first time?

51
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,610
Well, that was A.S.U.

52
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,713
Every single day was
like the first day of spring.

53
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,156
# Cold cooling at a bar #

54
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,126

for some action #

# But like MickJagger said,
I can't get no satisfaction #

56
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,993
#The girls are all around #

57
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,695
# But none of them

#When they know
that I'm the star #

64
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,550
# So I got up and strolled over #

65
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,676
#To the other side
of the cantina #

66
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,744
# I asked the guy,
''Why you so fly?'' #

# He said,
''Funky Cold Medina'' #

00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,198
Yo, who are you?

69
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,132

to meet Benny from Brooklyn.

in one dorm?

I guess so.

We're gonna go to A.S.U.'s
own private amusement park.

Benny: Besides the sun,
the fun, and the hotties...

00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,813
one of the biggest perks
of going to A.S.U....

96
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,715
was the fact that it was

Every campus has one.

176
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,295
If you wanted anything,
he was your man...

177
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,670
but his bread and butter
was makin' book.

178
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:33,938
Why don't you slap some dollars down
on your donkeyboys now, huh?

179
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,979
Hey, man. Put your money
where your mouth is.

180
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:37,912
Fine. Fine.
That ain't nothin'.

181
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,348
You know, I'll put, like,
uh, #200 on the Cowboys.

182
00:08:40,418 --> 00:08:41,817
200 it is.

183
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,012
You don't got #200
to blow, Benny.

184
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,850
You ain't gotta worry
about me.

185
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:47,686
My boys are gonna pull it out.
Watch. Watch.

186
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:49,248
They pulled it out,
all right, Benny.

187
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,022
They pulled it out,
and they played with it...

188
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:53,689
for four quarters
is what they did!

189
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:55,959
That's two large
you owe Troy now.

190
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,092
What are you gonna do now,
big shot?

191
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:00,329
Two. Two bucks. Two bucks.
Keg's in the room.

192
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,099
One, two. Two bucks. Two.

193
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,435
All right. Keg's in the back.

194
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:06,601
Two bucks. Two bucks.
That's it. Keg's in the back.

195
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,338
Two bucks.

196
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,539
What are you giving me
here, man?

197
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:13,607
Get in there, man.

198
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:16,312
Yo, hey, what's up, Hedake?

199
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:17,684
What's up, man?

200
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:19,245
Now, right around this time...

201
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,847
is when I met
Stevin ''Headake'' Smith...

202
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:23,416
the leading scorer
for the A.S.U. Sun Devils...

203
00:09:23,494 --> 00:09:25,155
and one hell of a ballplayer.

204
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:26,958
That was a sweet game last week.

205
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,499
- Who are you?
- Benny Silman. It's a pleasure.

206
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:31,626
What's up, Benny?
This is my boy Brady.

207
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:34,034
What's shakin', Benny?

208
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,335
- This your party, man?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,635
What's up with the ''C.M.A.''?

210
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:38,640
''Cover my ass.''

211
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:41,177
[Giggling]

212
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,439
[Sniffs]

213
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,378
I love the smell
of baby powder.

214
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:46,040
Hey, whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

215
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,379
You're not leaving yet, are you?

216
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,351
- Apparently.
- Now, hold up.

217
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,479
Hey, yo, the keg's
in the back, fellas.

218
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:53,284
Ain't no charge, all right?

219
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,324
I'm gonna talk to you later.

220
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,984
Yeah, you take care
of business, man.

221
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,187
All right. Hey, um...

222
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:01,493
we were in the same
calculus class last semester.

223
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,032
Yes, we were.
You don't remember me?

224
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,437
Rarely were we in the same
calculus class last semester.

225
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,697
Yeah, well.
[Chuckles]

226
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:11,240
Numbers always kind of
came easy for me.

227
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,900
Is that right?

228
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:16,070
You know, we got economics
together. You know that?

229
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,238
I got Mitchell, too.

230
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:19,748
I've never seen you
in my economics class.

231
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,478
Yeah, well, you know,
I really only show up...

232
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,349
for, like, the midterms
and the finals.

233
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,718
Well, that's all
that's important, right?

234
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:26,778
Yeah.

235
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:27,846
So what's your name?

236
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,893
- Callie.
- I'm Benny.

237
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,552
This is Marissa.

238
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:32,959
Marissa, is it?

239
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,258
- We have to--
- Wait! Wait!

240
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,889
No, you can't leave already.

241
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,456
What? Your friend gotta leave?

242
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,229
Well, we just got some momentum
going here.

243
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:40,736
We just started talking.

244
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:42,567
I got class in the morning.
I'm sorry.

245
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:51,913
Well, listen, you know,
if you got class tomorrow...

246
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:55,042
then that's OK, because maybe
we could make it a short night.

247
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:56,380
Hey, T, where you going?

248
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:59,388
Benny! Yo, Benny!

249
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,321
I have an econ midterm
tomorrow.

250
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,415
You do?

251
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,586
Yeah, and we're in
the same class, remember?

252
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,923
- Oh, right.
- Benny!

253
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,293
- We do.
- Yeah.

254
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:08,922
See? Look at me. I forgot.

255
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,832
Study hard, Benny.

256
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:13,767
- What?
- [Mumbling]

257
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:15,236
What are you doing?
Are you gonna come out here...

258
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,330
and do this whole, ''I love you, bro''
crap here on the front lawn...

259
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:18,465
with the plastic ass?

260
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,804
I'd take a bullet for you.

261
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,276
What are you doing?

262
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:22,505
I'd die for you, man.

263
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:24,638
Thank you.
Wonderful, and--?

264
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:25,682
That's all I'm saying.

265
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:26,817
- Get outta here!
- What, man?

266
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:27,374
- Get outta here!
- What, man?

267
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:29,783
[Car Horn Honks]

268
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:30,785
Damn.

269
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,116
Benny: It was Troy.

270
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,554
He was in the neighborhood...

271
00:11:33,624 --> 00:11:35,922
looking to settle up the 200
I owed him from the Dallas game.

272
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:37,756
You see, this was my plan.
I had figured...

273
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:40,490
that if about 200 people
came to my party at #2.00 a pop...

274
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,759
I could pay for the beer,
take care of the DJ...

275
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,994
and cover my debt to Troy.

276
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:47,332
- Hey, man. What's up?
- You all right?

277
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:49,463
I was just
in the neighborhood...

278
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,939
and I thought
we could take care...

279
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,805
of that unfinished business
that we had.

280
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:54,434
Right.

281
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:55,739
Having a party?

282
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:57,746
Yeah,just having
a few friends over, you know.

283
00:11:57,814 --> 00:12:00,749
Huh. I didn't know
you were having a party.

284
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,114
Yeah.

285
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:06,622
Um... I'm about 40 short, man,
I mean, I'm sorry.

286
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,056
But we're rollin' in another keg...

287
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:14,063
and I should have the rest
by midnight, if that's cool.

288
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:16,497
Well, all right. Don't worry
about that right now.

289
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:20,003
Are these--
Are these people your friends?

290
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,939
Well, yeah. The ones that
don't puke in my room.

291
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,339
That's funny.

292
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,672
Can I talk to you
for a second?

293
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:29,143
Yeah.

294
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:31,077
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

295
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,410
All right. Come here.

296
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,382
You like this car?

297
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,509
This car's phat, man.

298
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,712
Yeah.

299
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,015
I bet you could throw
a hell of a party...

300
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:39,020
in the back seat of this, huh?

301
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,556
Oh, yeah.

302
00:12:40,624 --> 00:12:43,092
Hey, baby, can you get out? I need
to talk to Benny for a second.

303
00:12:57,774 --> 00:12:59,207
Benny: Nice car.

304
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:00,368
Thanks, man.

305
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:01,741
She's a pretty girl, huh?

306
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:04,372
Oh, yeah, she's a knockout.

307
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,710
Well, Rebecca and this car...

308
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:07,249
they have one thing in common...

309
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,807
upkeep.

310
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,716
Upkeep costs money, Benny.

311
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:11,845
Where do you
make your money?

312
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:14,356
I got a job... at Rossi's.

313
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,051
Rossi's, right.

314
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,651
Well, let me tell you, selling
underwear in some department store...

315
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:20,959
isn't gonna get you a car like this
or a girl who looks like that.

316
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:22,623
- I work in Suits.
- Sure you do.

317
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:26,601
You work for me, you can
make #1 ,000 a week.

318
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,069
#1 ,000?

319
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,105
That's right.

320
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,605
Doing what?

321
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:33,142
You know what
a stake horse is, Benny?

322
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,336
No.

323
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,379
Well, it's somebody
that's backing you.

324
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:37,378
Bankrolling your operation.

325
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:38,641
In your case, that'd be me.

326
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:40,410
Now, all you have to do
is you just get...

327
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,179
a few of your friends here together.
You start gambling.

328
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,481
You want me to be a bookie?

329
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,386
That's right. Take the bets...

330
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:49,425
if they win, you give 'em
some of the bank-- my bank.

331
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,551
Well, what if they lose?

332
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,561
Well, collecting,
that's not so pleasant...

333
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:55,598
but that's why I'm willing
to pay you up to a grand a week.

334
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:59,625
Oh, whoa, nah,
'cause first it was a grand.

335
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:01,330
And now it's ''up to'' a grand.

336
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,669
[Laughing]
All right. All right.

337
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,174
Well, you know, you keep your
#5-an-hour department store job.

338
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,768
I'm offering you a chance
to make some easy money, OK?

339
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,780
Now, at most, you're gonna work
1 0-1 5 hours a week tops.

340
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:13,406
I mean, the action--
That doesn't really ever start...

341
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,916
until the day before a game.

342
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,953
You get 1 5% of my cut.

343
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,749
So if you book
#1 0,000 in bets...

344
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:21,188
I clear half that, you get 7 50.

345
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:23,158
- 7 50?
- That's right.

346
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:27,863
No offense, but I feel like
the longer I'm talkin' to you...

347
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,489
the more money I'm losin'.

348
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,296
Well, that all depends upon
how hard you wanna work.

349
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:37,106
All right, well, what if
there aren't any winnings?

350
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,607
Seriously, what if we lose?

351
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,973
Benny, Benny, Benny,
we're the house.

352
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,875
The house never loses.

353
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:50,645
You want a couple of beers?

354
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,313
I got class.

355
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:53,879
You do, and it's about
to start right now.

356
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,322
Can we have
a couple of beers, please?

357
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:57,587
You got that remote?

358
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:00,919
All right, Benny,
here's the deal.

359
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:03,625
Ever since the tortoise
first lined up against the hare...

360
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,668
there's been some joker willing
to put a deuce down on one of'em...

361
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,727
and someone just as willing
to book the bet.

362
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,739
Now, what
you're gonna be doing is...

363
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:11,305
you're gonna be taking bets
on the spread.

364
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:13,899
I know what the spread is.

365
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:15,807
No, you think you know,
but you have no idea.

366
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:16,810
Thank you.

367
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,040
It's pretty easy
to understand, though.

368
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:20,946
The spread represents
a number of points...

369
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:23,382
that one team is favored
over another.

370
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:24,714
For example, the Bills.

371
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:27,881
They might be 6-point favorites
at home over the Dolphins.

372
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:30,255
Essentially the Bills
are giving the Dolphins...

373
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,624
an extra 6 points
at the end of the game...

374
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:35,061
so that if you bet Bills,
they had better win by 7 points.

375
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,393
Otherwise,
I hate to tell you, kid...

376
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,330
the smart money
was on the fish.

377
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,335
Calculating the spread,
you have match-ups to consider...

378
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:43,564
win/loss records
at home and on the road...

379
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,402
a West Coast team
traveling east...

380
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:46,566
is gonna have more jet lag...

381
00:15:46,642 --> 00:15:49,008
than an East Coast team
traveling west...

382
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:50,978
injuries,
the playing schedule...

383
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:53,537
emotion, motivation--
all these things factor in.

384
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,083
It's tricky.
You gotta do your homework.

385
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,642

put money in your pocket...

what it's all about, Benny...

in your pocket.

00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:05,093

to a whole new way of life...

00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:06,856
a new religion.

391
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:09,363

what I was doing was illegal...

Yeah, he's like one of them
armchair quarterbacks,

518
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,533
trying to relive his glory days
of high school.

519
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:45,938
Yeah, right.

520
00:20:46,008 --> 00:20:49,444
Yeah. So tell me,
what's your major?

521
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,274
Well, actually,
I'm a Design major.

522
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,279
Benny, Benny,
uh, excuse me.

523
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,782
Benny Silman? Chuck.

524
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,874
Remember me?
Gary's cousin.

525
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:57,942
What's up? Oh, Gary.
Yeah. How's Gary?

526
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,282
Well, he's--
He's OK.

Uh, listen,

529
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:03,883
Right. Right. Ram game.

530
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,756
Your best bet
is call me tomorrow.

531
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:06,954
- All right?
- OK.

532
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:08,553
I'm kinda having dinner
right now.

533
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,928
Know what I'm saying?

534
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:12,524
Yeah, sorry. Look, I'll give you
a call tomorrow.

535
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:13,727
All right?
All right. Nice to meet ya.

536
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,099
All right.

537
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,606
Uh, I'm embarrassed.
Damn, I'm sorry.

538
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:21,700
Don't be sorry.
Just doing business, right?

539
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:24,041
Nah, it's just, you know,
I got, like, a lot of friends.

540
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:26,138
I make friends quick.

541
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:27,739
Just working.

542
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,410
What are you talking about?

543
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:34,319
Oh, come on, Benny.

544
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,881
You're a bookie.

545
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,790
Benny-man!
What's shakin', Cap'n.

546
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,056
So what's the line
on the Eagles this weekend?

547
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,724
[Laughing] Yeah, what's the line
on the Eagles this weekend?

548
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,993
Ooh, no, no, no, um...

549
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:48,594
actually, the Rams--
I wanna put money on the Rams.

550
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:49,899
You should think about
putting money on the Rams.

551
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:50,904
You really should.

552
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:52,235
I've heard it's,
like, a good thing.

553
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:54,503
Are you a Rams fan?
He's not a Rams fan.

554
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:56,009
- All right.
- What is the line on the Eagles?

555
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:57,010
You're makin' fun of me.

556
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,307
No, I'm not.

557
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,642
Can we just get the check?

558
00:21:59,715 --> 00:22:00,682
We're gonna get outta here.

559
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:02,614
I grew up in North Carolina.

560
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:05,677
Um, we had a horse farm
outside of Charlotte.

561
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:07,221
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,221
A horse farm?

563
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,222
Mm-hmm.

564
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,883
That sounds completely crazy.

565
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,221
I'm a city boy.

566
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:15,627
I had no idea
horses grew on trees.

567
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:17,029
Very funny.

568
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:18,464
A ranch.

569
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,934
We raise quarter horses.

570
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:22,368
- Nice.
- Uh-huh.

571
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:23,370
You miss it?

572
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,997
I do.

573
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:28,669
It's beautiful there,
and I miss my sister.

574
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,541
I miss my dad.

575
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:33,137
I was supposed to go
to Chapel Hill.

576
00:22:33,215 --> 00:22:35,911
Everybody in my family
went to Chapel Hill.

577
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:39,249
So, needless to say,
they weren't too thrilled...

578
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:41,221
when I decided
to go to A.S.U.

579
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,814
I don't know, I just--

580
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,689
I needed to do something
for myself, you know?

581
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,388
[Sighs]

582
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,328
What about you, Benny Silman?

583
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,525
Oh, no, no, Silman's
not my name.

584
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,931
That's just an alias.

585
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,559
I'm a Rockefeller.

586
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:55,830
- Oh, right.

588
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,270
All right,
you ready to get to work?

589
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:02,207
Get to work?

590
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:04,404
Oh, yeah.
This is a working date.

591
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,970
That's right.

592
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:07,811
Let's begin.

593
00:23:07,883 --> 00:23:11,250

The Theory of Economic Behavior?

594
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,083
- You gotta be kidding me, right?
- Nope.

595
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:15,885
Come on, now.
You need help with this.

596
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,927
OK, um...

597
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:20,325

598

- Yes!

605
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:33,366
That's perfect. Very good.

606
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:34,932
You're a smart cookie.
I'd like to eat you up.

607
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,671
Ooh.

608
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:39,612
All right. All right.
I'm gonna try a harder one.

609
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:41,308
I'm gonna try
to stump you now.

610
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:43,010
Ooh.

611
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:47,715
Explain economic parity.

612
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,724
Oof.

613
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:50,781
Hoo.

Um...

616
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:02,101
Close. Awfully close.

617
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:04,435
Not at all, huh?

618
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:05,939
Here, let's try another one.

619
00:24:06,008 --> 00:24:09,842
OK.

620
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:12,073

623
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,612
Benny:
So Callie and I started dating...

624
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:21,747
and it was great.

625
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:23,223
Everything was going my way.

626
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,920
As long as there was sports
on the TV...

627
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:27,325
people were bettin' like mad...

628
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:29,921
and I was pulling in
lots of money.

629
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:31,056

633
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,231
Oh, what's up, Troy?

634
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:37,966
How'd we do this week?

635
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,473
We took a hit on the Islanders...

636
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,872
but the Bulls game was pretty.

637
00:24:40,943 --> 00:24:42,308
We cleared about 4,000.

638
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:47,506
It's all there.

639
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,414
All right.

640
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:51,783
Keep up the good work, kid.
I'll see you next week.

641
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,188
''Keep up the good work.''

642
00:24:57,259 --> 00:25:01,127
Problem was I was just
handing it over to somebody else.

643
00:25:01,196 --> 00:25:03,130
Troy was the only one
making money.

644
00:25:03,198 --> 00:25:06,827
So the next year I decided
to try and go out on my own.

645
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:08,199
I got my own crib.

646
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,362
I got about 30 guys gambling...

647
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:11,929
with 3 Gs of my own money
as the bank...

648
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:13,702
and it was
the Dolphins and the Bills...

649
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:15,333
and everyone bet the Bills.

650
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,571
It was pretty much
if the Bills won the game...

651
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,547
I'd lose everything, and...

652
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:23,018
I'd be out of business,
like, the first week.

653
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:26,143
Damn!

654
00:25:26,221 --> 00:25:27,483
Come on, Danny boy!

00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:28,954
Hey, Benny, how much money'd
you put on this game?

this had to be a big one.

665
00:25:54,783 --> 00:26:00,415
Because as soon as
Dan Marino made that pass...

666
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:02,752
I was in business for myself.

667

All right, let me tell you, man...

668
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:07,358
business started poppin'!

669
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,398
There was so much action...

670
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:14,902
that I started hiring my own crew
to answer some of the phones.

671
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:17,437
I mean, it seemed like there was
nothing people wouldn't bet on.

00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:04,346
- Excuse us for a minute.
- OK.

695
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:07,217
So I've been hearing your name
all over the place, bro.

696
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:10,348
Word on the street says
you got things dialed in.

697
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,620
Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe. You know.

698
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:14,594
Yo, that's a sweet ride, bro.

699
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:17,495
Oh, my boy Brady, he got
the deep pockets, man.

700
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:19,658
He hooks me up now. I'll get
him back when I hit the pros.

701
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:20,894
A little reciprocity,
you know what I'm saying?

702
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:21,958
I hear you.

703
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:24,163
I mean, you think I could dress
like this on an NCAA salary?

704
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:26,730
True that.
True that.

705
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:29,371
Oh, but look, bro.

706
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:31,435
I wanna put 2 hundo
on my Dallas boys this weekend.

707
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:32,445
That cool?

708
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:33,572
Are you a Dallas fan?

709
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:35,081
Oh, born and raised.

710
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,586
Yo, I am the craziest
Dallas fan ever, bro.

711
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:39,813
That can't go over
too well back in Brooklyn.

712
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:40,820
Dude, tell me about it, man.

713
00:27:40,889 --> 00:27:43,483
It's--
It's hot on the block.

714
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:46,994
- For sure. For sure.
- All right? All right. All right.

715
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:48,858
Two hundo on the boys.
Yo, consider it done.

716
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,625
- All right.
- You know, anytime...

717
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:53,599
for you, for your boy,
your whole fam...

718
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:54,635
you know where to come.

719
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:56,192
Cool. Good lookin', man.

720
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:57,863
- Thanks.
- Yo, peace.

721
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,133
All right, Headake.

722
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:00,469
- Bye.
- Cool.

723
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:01,600
See ya.

724
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:03,940
All right.

725
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,144
It's crazy. It is.

726
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:10,411
That kid's gonna be
in the NBA one year.

727
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:12,180
No joke.

728
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,754
Yeah, you got 1 ,400
on the Bulls givin' 1 5.

729
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:17,188
All right. That's good.

730
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:21,354
Benny: So we settled in on
a routine of rakin' in lots of cash.

731
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,057
But diversification
is the key to growth...

732
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:28,000
so I encouraged my boys to look
for other areas of opportunity.

733
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:31,232
One of those kids, Nick,
did just that.

734
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:33,672
- Hey, Benny?
- What?

735
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,971
Hey, this is my older brotherJoe.

736
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:37,773
Oh, hey. How are you?

737
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:38,903
How you doin', Benny?

738
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,912
I'm good. This is T-Bone.

739
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:41,141
How you doin'?

740
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:42,808
T-Bone...

741
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:46,012
was Nick's older brother.

742
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:47,054
He was a sharp gambler--

743
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,452
kinda like a wise guy...

744
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:51,981
27-year-old stockbroker
and very well connected.

745
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,755
Why don't you have a seat?

746
00:28:53,828 --> 00:28:56,126
Make yourself comfortable.
Where you from? Chicago?

747
00:28:56,197 --> 00:28:58,324
Yeah, I was on my way
to San Fran.

748
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,060
You don't sound like
you're from Chicago.

749
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:01,970
Yeah, well, I travel a lot.

750
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,062
Checkin' on my little brother.

751
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,104
How's he doin'?
All right?

752
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:05,332
Staying out of trouble.

753
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:06,600
So I hear.

754
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:08,164
Nick tells me you got
quite a little operation...

755
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:09,175
in the works here.

756
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:11,212
Just fulfilling a demand.

757
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,211
It makes me feel proud...

758
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,406
to know that there's still...

759
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:14,948
some enterprising
college pukes in the world.

760
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:17,712
I see busloads of'em
every day in Chi town...

761
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:19,343
walking around
with their diplomas...

762
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,115
and their hands out.

763
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:22,486
You're ahead of the game, Benny.

764
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:23,922
You gotta keep that attitude.

765
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:25,459
Nicky says you like
the action, huh?

766
00:29:25,526 --> 00:29:27,255
I play.

767
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,386
Matter of fact...

768
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:29,395
what do you got the Bulls...

769
00:29:29,464 --> 00:29:31,591
givin' on the spread this weekend?

770
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,598
- We got 1 5.
- 1 5.

771
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,066
1 5? Ouch.

772
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:36,126
Bet you Riley's got the Rolex...

773
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:37,432
ridin' on a spread like that.

774
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:39,439
Why don't you put me down
for two dimes...

775
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:41,304
- on the Bulls.
- All right. 200?

776
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:43,503
2,000, Benny.

777
00:29:46,581 --> 00:29:47,548
You can cover?

778
00:29:47,615 --> 00:29:49,549
Yeah.

779
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:50,606
I can cover that.

780
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:52,414
Great. What do you got
the Celtics doin'?

781
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:54,717
- Seven, at home.
- Wow.

782
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:55,983
Seven, huh?

783
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,888
You might be a little generous
on that one, Benny.

784
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,221
Oh, yeah, you think so?

785
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:01,091
Well, yeah. Why don't you give me
two on the Celtics?

786
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:04,428
Two more on the Celtics?

787
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,296
- Yeah.
- You got it.

788
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:08,062
You good with this?

789
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:10,229
- Yeah.
- You sure, kid?

790
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:11,329
I got it.

791
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:12,338
What about the Spurs?

792
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:13,339
What are the Spurs doin'?

793
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:15,672
TheJazz.
TheJazz are giving 1 2.

794
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,074
That'll be a barn burner.

795
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:18,407
Heh heh heh heh.

796
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:19,707
Gimme two on theJazz...

797
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,180
just 'cause I like
those purple uniforms.

798
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:22,910
- Done.
- Great.

799
00:30:22,984 --> 00:30:24,474
You should swing by
my hotel Sunday.

800
00:30:24,552 --> 00:30:25,576
- Sunday.
- We'll settle up.

801
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:26,779
Nicky, good.
Yeah.

802
00:30:26,854 --> 00:30:28,048
- All right.
- All right, T-Bone.

803
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:29,487
- Take care.
- All right, guys.

804
00:30:29,557 --> 00:30:30,489
Later, T-Bone.

805
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:31,490
That's a good touch.

806
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:35,561
You outta your mind?

807
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,393
Are you outta your mind?

808
00:30:37,465 --> 00:30:38,523
Benny, you just took six grand.

809
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,335
You can't cover #6,000, Benny.

810
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:42,696
Chill. Chill out, dude.

811
00:30:43,103 --> 00:30:44,934
There ain't no way
he's gonna win 'em all.

812
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:47,840
Hey, Benny.
Come on in, kid.

813
00:30:47,908 --> 00:30:49,341
Come on, what are you
standin' there for?

814
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:50,501
Get in here.

815
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:53,270
Come on.
Don't look so down.

816
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:54,974
You know what they say:

817
00:30:55,048 --> 00:30:56,242
''You win some,
you lose some.''

818
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:58,841
Yeah. I lost all three.

819
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,318
You sure did, kid.

820
00:31:00,387 --> 00:31:01,877
That's tough luck.

821
00:31:01,955 --> 00:31:03,286
Have a seat.

822
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:06,053
Hey, uh,JoeJr., man,
um, listen...

823
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:09,823
I got like, #2,800 in cash.

824
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:11,727
I got another 900 in markers.

825
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,358
I can have that to you
by the end of the week.

826
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:17,961
The rest, I'm just gonna
need a little more time.

827
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,565
I wasn't interested
in breaking the bank, kid.

828
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:23,336
You told me
that you could cover.

829
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,672
I know.

830
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:26,235
Drink?

831
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:27,507
Uh, no, thanks.

832
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:29,446
You got balls, Benny.

833
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:30,949
That's commendable...

834
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:32,541
but I gotta tell ya...

835
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:34,951
one look at
your little enterprise...

836
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:37,421
and it's clear you're going
about things all wrong.

837
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:40,719
[Sighs]

838
00:31:40,794 --> 00:31:41,852
What do you mean?

839
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:43,828
I mean your system is antiquated.

840
00:31:43,897 --> 00:31:45,762
Your logic is sound...

841
00:31:45,832 --> 00:31:47,527
but you gotta
think outside the box.

842
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,000
You need to be more creative.

843
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:51,867
Left-brain thinking in a business
dominated by right brainers...

844
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,565
is what's gonna set you apart.

845
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,902
For instance...

846
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,500
spending a lot of time reading
the sports pages, right?

847
00:31:57,577 --> 00:31:59,442
Making calls, checking stats.

848
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:01,105
You probably even know
a team's flight schedule.

849
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:04,116
But anybody, anybody
could pick up a paper...

850
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:05,344
and get that information.

851
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:09,116
What I'm talkin' about
is knowledge.

852
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:10,213
''The steam.''

853
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,485
- ''Steam''?
- That's right, kid.

854
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,685
And it's hot.

855
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,558
And you gotta move fast
before the steam vanishes...

856
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,120
'cause if you don't
act on the steam...

857
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:19,756
you're left with nothin', zilch.

858
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,233
Inside information.

859
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:23,929
That's what
I'm talkin' about, kid.

860
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:25,266
Once you got that...

861
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,397
the spread becomes meaningless...

862
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:29,374
because then
you're calling the shots.

863
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,104
Right? Hmm?

864
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,603
I tell you what.

865
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:36,945
I take what
you got for now.

866
00:32:37,017 --> 00:32:38,917
Forget about that six grand
you owe me.

867
00:32:38,985 --> 00:32:41,613
What I want you to do is concentrate
on what you can do for me.

868
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:43,952
If you could bring me something
that we could both use...

869
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:46,652
then maybe we could

All right.

872
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:50,595
What are you thinking?

873
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:51,926
I don't know.

874
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:54,726
I do know one thing...

875
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,598
that you'll know it
when you see it.

876
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:00,234
You're dizzy already.

877

Shut up, you fat bastard.
Look at that.

You just ruined my perfect--

That is all she wrote,
my friend.

884
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:12,814
You owe me another 20,
Headake.

885
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:15,480
That's another 20.
Look, you bet me, OK?

886
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:16,954
I told you I'd kick your ass.

887
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,422
That's right.

888
00:33:18,492 --> 00:33:20,892
Hey, and it was a pleasure doing
business with you, my friend.

889
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:21,985
Don't go too far.
I need money, too.

901
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:47,276
that was one hell of
a game against S.C.

902
00:33:47,354 --> 00:33:50,016
I made a boatload
off of your skills.

903
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,455
Ah, you made
money off of me?

904

Oh, yeah.

905
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:54,116
Oh, yeah.

Everybody makes money
off me but me, man.

907
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,590
Wish I could make
some money off me.

908
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:16,539
I won't lose no games.

909

Hey, Benny.

914
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:29,788
So I was thinking about
what you said the other day...

915
00:34:29,863 --> 00:34:31,524
and I think I got something.

916
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:33,122
Spill the beans, kid.
What is it?

917
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,461
I got a player.

918
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:36,263
I got a player
in my pocket.

919
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:38,463
I thought you might
be interested.

920
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:40,529
Now you're workin', kid.

921
00:34:40,607 --> 00:34:41,631
I'm interested.
Who is he?

922
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:42,766
He's on his way to becoming...

923
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:44,605
the second highest scorer
in A.S.U. history.

924
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:45,940
You gotta be kiddin' me.

925

Nope.

You sure you got
this kid in the bag?

927

All tied up
and ready for delivery.

928
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:52,843
We're talking about
shavin' points here, Benny.

929
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,716
That could be tricky.
A lot of things to consider.

930
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,449
You gotta find the right game...

931
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:59,549
and you gotta make sure that your
pony can't spook out of the gate.

932
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:01,594
He won't, and I got the game.

00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:04,191
How much is this
gonna cost me?

40,000.

936
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:07,528
40 Gs is a lot of money, Benny.

937
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:08,533
Is he worth it?

938
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:10,934

1045
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:26,082
Why? Because if some
eye-in-the-sky catches you...

1046
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,421
and some big brain
puts two and two together...

1047
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:29,460
you're toast.

1048
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:30,653
- On word?
- Word.

1049
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:31,695
The eye-in-the-sky?

1050
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:32,752
- Eye-in-the-sky.
- Got it.

1051
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,457
Got it?

1052
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:38,229
The eye-in-the-sky!

1053
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:40,237
Is this great stuff, or what?

1054
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:43,331
Benny:JoeJr. explained to me...

1055
00:39:43,408 --> 00:39:45,933
that each bet was kept
under 1 0 grand...

1056
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,272
so we wouldn't
draw a flag...

1057
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:48,312
at any one casino.

1058
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:51,246
# Up to no good... #

1059
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:58,682
# Shot #

1060
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,424
# Shot #

1061
00:40:03,795 --> 00:40:05,262
# Shot #

1062
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,200
# Up to no good #

1063
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:14,336
# Shot #

1064
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,270
# Shot #

1065
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:24,941
# Shot #

1066
00:40:25,016 --> 00:40:27,576
# Up to no good #

1067
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:29,313
If there's one thing
I learned, kid...

1068
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,480
when you're on a roll...

1069
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:33,683
chase your bets.

1070
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:42,329
JoeJr.:
What do you think, Benny?

1071
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,935
You think we could do it again?

1072
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,093
Shouldn't be a problem.

1073
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:57,780
Ha ha! Headake, my man!

1074
00:40:57,848 --> 00:40:59,247
Unh! What up, dawg?

1075
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:00,375
What up, kid?

1076
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:03,045
Yo, you almost made me
keel over at that game.

1077
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,212
- Did you see that?
- Did I--

1078
00:41:04,288 --> 00:41:07,189
Career-high 39 points?
Ten three-pointers?

1079
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,190
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1080
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:09,191
Whoo-hoo!

1081
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,160
Whoo-hoo!

1082
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:13,492
Yo, I gotta tell you, B-man,
I had it right there...

1083
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:15,532
in the palm of my hand
and everything.

1084
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,090
When I popped a ''J,'' you know,
with, like, 1 2 seconds left...

1085
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:19,864
a little off-center,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1086
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:20,904
And it dinged off the rim...

1087
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:24,499
and the crowd was
just, like, ''Aw.''

1088
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:26,167
Yo, it was perfect, dawg.

1089
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,210
You did good.

1090
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:28,870
Yes, I did.

1091
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:29,913
Gimme the loot.
Gimme the loot.

1092
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,875
Whoo-hoo!

1093
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:37,318
Aah!

1094
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:40,755
Aw.

1095
00:41:40,825 --> 00:41:42,952
Ha ha ha. Damn!

1096
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:43,959
Right? Right?

1097
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:45,518
- Huh?
- 20,000.

1098
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:46,688
And they want to do it again.

1099
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:48,391
When?

1100
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:50,127
It's up to us.

1101
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:54,194
All right, now, tomorrow
against Oregon looks good.

1102
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:56,432
How you feel?

1103
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:57,439
Damn.

1104
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:04,406
Can I help you?

1105
00:42:11,622 --> 00:42:12,646
You know who I am?

1106
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:15,191
Benny:
Shawn ''Big Red'' Pepello...

1107
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:18,057
local drug dealer and
self-made gangsta wannabe.

1108
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,154
You know why I'm here, don't you?

1109
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:21,755
Did you want to place a bet?

1110
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:23,629
Nah. I'm in.

1111
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:25,259
In what?

1112
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,360
Don't make me
waste my time...

1113
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:27,597
beatin' the crap
out of you, kid.

1114
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:29,138
I know you got a player
on the basketball team...

1115
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:30,138
in your pocket.

1116
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:31,834
Him.

1117
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:34,605
Hey, man, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

1118
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,475
Later, B. I got practice.

1119
00:42:36,547 --> 00:42:38,174
I know you're shavin' points...

1120
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:39,614
and I know you got
a good thing goin'.

1121
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,173
And I'm in.

1122
00:42:41,252 --> 00:42:43,618
If you don't mind my asking...

1123
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,120
how did you get
this information?

1124
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:46,486
Oh, I got friends.

1125
00:42:46,557 --> 00:42:47,956
When's the next game?

1126
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,988
Tomorrow. Oregon.

1127
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:54,759
Good.

1128
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:00,230
How much is in there?

1129
00:43:00,304 --> 00:43:01,737
20,000.

1130
00:43:01,806 --> 00:43:03,000
Now, here's the deal.

1131
00:43:03,074 --> 00:43:04,735
I'm gonna go ahead
and keep this for now...

1132
00:43:04,809 --> 00:43:07,403
just to make sure you do what
you're supposed to tomorrow.

1133
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:10,140
Then I'll give it back,
plus another twenty.

1134
00:43:10,214 --> 00:43:11,511
Is that OKwith you?

1135
00:43:11,582 --> 00:43:13,174
Sure, man.

1136
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,377
Good.

1137
00:43:15,453 --> 00:43:18,479
And you. You're gonna watch
the game with me tomorrow.

1138
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:20,046
You understand?

1139
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:21,455
This way I can keep
my eye on both of you...

1140
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,459
at the same time.

1141
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:27,296
- Baby.
- Mm-hmm?

1142
00:43:27,364 --> 00:43:28,296
I gotta go.

1143
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:29,798
- No.
- No, I gotta go.

1144
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:32,233
Callie, baby, I gotta go.

1145
00:43:32,303 --> 00:43:33,463
No, no, no, no, no.

1146
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:35,164
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Baby...

1147
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,673
I gotta go. I gotta--
No. I gotta go.

1148
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:40,803
Why do you have
to go to Vegas?

1149
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:42,505
You were just there.

1150
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,707
Yeah, well, you know,
it's just for the day...

1151
00:43:44,782 --> 00:43:49,219
and I'm gonna
be back tonight.

1152
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:50,514
What's goin' on?

1153
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:54,922
Oh, you know,
the guys screwed up.

1154
00:43:54,992 --> 00:43:56,516
The guys screwed up...

1155
00:43:56,594 --> 00:43:59,586
and they took too much action
on that Celtics game...

1156
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:02,530
and, like, I just gotta--

1157
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,090
I just gotta lay it off for 'em.

1158
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:06,830
I'm just layin' some of it off.
That's all.

1159
00:44:06,904 --> 00:44:09,202
You know, it's just work.

1160
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:11,173
It's just--
It's just work.

1161
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:14,905
It's just work.

1162
00:44:14,979 --> 00:44:16,071
I want no work.

1163
00:44:16,147 --> 00:44:17,079
Sweetheart, I can't.

1164
00:44:17,148 --> 00:44:20,640
I want no T-Bone, no Mook.

1165
00:44:20,718 --> 00:44:21,650
Sweetheart--

1166
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,744
Just you and me.

1167
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:26,847
I want to. Mmm,
I want to so bad, but--

1168
00:44:26,924 --> 00:44:27,982
- [Horn Honks]
- Ah, I gotta go.

1169
00:44:28,058 --> 00:44:29,992
- Oh, baby.
- I gotta go, Callie.

1170
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,654
I'm so sorry. I love you.
I'm gonna call you.

1171
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,425
I'm gonna call you, all right?

1172
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:42,699
You're a sharp guy, right?

1173
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:44,866
You know all about gambling.

1174
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:47,968
Yeah, I guess. Why?

1175
00:44:48,045 --> 00:44:51,344
'Cause I'm offering you
a sure thing here.

1176
00:44:51,415 --> 00:44:53,781
Baby, why do you gotta do that?

1177
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:54,783
Why you gotta do that for?

1178
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:56,513
You know I gotta leave.

1179
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:57,952
You know I gotta go.

1180
00:44:58,022 --> 00:44:59,751
Oh, God. You know, listen.

1181
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:00,847
Mm-hmm?

1182
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:04,122
I'm gonna be back
by 9:00, all right?

1183
00:45:04,195 --> 00:45:07,687
We're gonna go to dinner
at Diego's, all right?

1184
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:11,965
I promise.

1185
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,537
Benny:
Oh, man, I was in deep...

1186
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:19,098
and there was no way I could
tell Callie what was goin' on.

1187
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:20,336
She would have freaked.

1188
00:45:20,411 --> 00:45:23,380
I had 600 pounds of sin
waiting for me in that car...

1189
00:45:23,447 --> 00:45:25,278
just droolin' for another win.

1190
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:26,873
And it was all on Headake.

1191
00:45:26,951 --> 00:45:28,213
If he didn't deliver...

1192
00:45:28,285 --> 00:45:30,253
there was no doubt I was gonna be
comin' back from Vegas...

1193
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:33,557
wearin' a toe tag.

1194
00:45:34,157 --> 00:45:36,125
Announcer: Headake at the top
of the key waiting for a pick.

1195
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,683
Now he's gonna pull up,
and he gets it.

1196
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:39,854
Headake Smith.

1197
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,420
The Ducks have been giving
A.S.U. the perimeter...

1198
00:45:41,498 --> 00:45:43,022
for most of the second half...

1199
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:44,930
and the Sun Devils--

1200
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:46,195
Benny:
It wasn't lookin' good.

1201
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:48,328
A.S.U. was givin' twelve
to the Ducks...

1202
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:51,340
and Headake couldn't quite
get it under control.

1203
00:45:51,408 --> 00:45:53,137
They were up 1 5
for most of the game...

1204
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,040
and I was startin' to sweat.

1205
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:57,875
Your boy better shave us
at least ten there, big shot.

1206
00:45:57,948 --> 00:45:58,880
He'll do it.

1207
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:00,473
Oh, he better.

1208
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,677
Headake, please, man.

1209
00:46:02,752 --> 00:46:04,982
Benny: If Headake
didn't get on track quick...

1210
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,522
this was gonna be a train wreck.

1211
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:08,387
Come on. Come on!

1212
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:10,153
Benny:
We were still up by twelve.

1213
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,887
Headake needed to trim two more.

1214
00:46:11,962 --> 00:46:13,520
Headake, please, bud.

1215
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:15,690
Benny: Two before the buzzer.

1216
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:18,233
We just needed two.

1217

Yo, Headake was amazing.

1222
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:31,772
Headake had mastered
the art of giving 98%.

1223
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:33,247
Watch this.

He steps back six inches...

1228
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:45,758
just before the player
fires the ball.

1229
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:48,923
Just enough to take him
out of reach.

1230
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,297
It was a perfect 98%.

01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:45,024
- I'm in control.
- It's too dangerous!

1734
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:46,123
Screw that, man!

1735
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,132
It's time to cash in.

1736
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:50,027
What do you think this is?

1737
01:05:50,104 --> 01:05:51,696
What do you think
we're doing here, bro?

1738
01:05:51,772 --> 01:05:54,070
Reason with yourself.
This is all wrong.

1739
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:55,073
All wrong!

1740
01:05:55,142 --> 01:05:56,074
I'll tell you what's wrong, Benny--

1741
01:05:56,143 --> 01:05:57,303
I ain't tryin' to get in trouble.

1742
01:05:57,378 --> 01:05:59,107
You know how much money
a top male basketball player...

1743
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,374
generates for his school annually?

1744
01:06:00,448 --> 01:06:01,380
You know what?
I don't even care.

1745
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:02,313
Oh, you don't care?

1746
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:03,315
I don't. No,
I don't want to hear it.

1747
01:06:03,384 --> 01:06:05,113
#7 00,000!

1748
01:06:05,186 --> 01:06:07,746
That's a 7 with 5 zeros
behind it, man!

1749
01:06:07,822 --> 01:06:09,257
You believe that?

1750
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,857
You know how much
money was bet...

1751
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,553
on college basketball
alone last year, man?

1752
01:06:13,628 --> 01:06:15,220
#50 million.

1753
01:06:15,296 --> 01:06:17,696
That's a 5 with 7 zeros
behind it, man.

1754
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,063
Man, are you with me so far?
'Cause here comes the kicker.

1755
01:06:20,134 --> 01:06:21,101
Do you know how much money...

1756
01:06:21,168 --> 01:06:23,193
a guy like me
makes off of all of that?

1757
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,795
Zero.

1758
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:26,169
No number in front of it.

1759
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,172
No number behind it.

1760
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:28,970
Just zero. You got it?

1761
01:06:29,043 --> 01:06:31,409
Yo, Callie!
Yo, Callie!

1762
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:32,468
Whoa, whoa, where you think
you're goin', man?

1763
01:06:32,546 --> 01:06:33,478
We ain't finished yet.

1764
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,584
I'm gonna do this thing.

1765
01:06:38,653 --> 01:06:41,144
One more game.

1766
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:42,712
Are you in or out?

1767
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,917
Benny: This is the thing
you got to understand.

1768
01:06:44,992 --> 01:06:47,153
I could have
walked away right then.

1769
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:49,059
And believe me,
every cell in my body...

1770
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,427
was screaming to do just that.

1771
01:06:50,498 --> 01:06:52,056
Just walk away. Leave.

1772
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,624
But money,
especially easy money...

1773
01:06:54,702 --> 01:06:57,398
has a strange way
of drowning out the voices.

1774
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,065
Benny:
This was it. The last push.

1775
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:03,076
A.S.U. vs. Washington.

1776
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:05,237
The Sun Devils were
giving 1 1 to Washington.

1777
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,975
Not the kind of dog
you want to wag.

1778
01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:09,778
Big Red managed
to work a deal...

1779
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,511
with some Cuban guys
he was in business with...

1780
01:07:11,585 --> 01:07:14,486
to fund his roll of the dice.

1781
01:07:14,555 --> 01:07:17,456
JoeJr. and the Mangiameles
bet the farm.

1782
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:20,016
As for me,
I let it ride, too.

1783
01:07:20,094 --> 01:07:22,028
I had JoeJr.
bet all the money...

1784
01:07:22,096 --> 01:07:24,189
he and the Mangiameles
were paying me.

1785
01:07:24,265 --> 01:07:25,357
From what I heard...

1786
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:27,663
Vegas looked like
an A.S.U. Homecoming parade.

1787
01:07:27,735 --> 01:07:30,431
Word got out, and I mean
everybody and their mother...

1788
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:31,528
made the trek to Sin City...

1789
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:32,970
to lay down their milk money.

1790
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,405
I even heard about 1 5 guys...

1791
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:37,103
who packed in the back of
a U-Haul truck and made the trip.

1792
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:41,080
There was so much action
on this one nothing game...

1793
01:07:41,148 --> 01:07:44,914
that the spread went from
1 1 all the way down to four.

1794
01:07:44,985 --> 01:07:47,351
Me? I was a nervous wreck.

1795
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:52,085
I wanted to stay as far away
from Vegas as I could.

1796
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,617
T-Bone and I decided to watch
the game at the arena.

1797
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,960
I don't know why. I thought
maybe I'd bring us some luck.

1798
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:02,901
I had no idea our luck had
run out long before tip-off.

1799
01:08:04,105 --> 01:08:05,402
Give me
the Gaming Control Board.

for the Huskies there.

1802
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,594
Not a good start
for Arizona State.

1803

Come on in, Zans!
Go for it!

This is the sportsbook manager
from the Mirage.

We've moved the line
over 40 times...

on this
Arizona State-Washington game.

1807
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:00,553
Well, the problem is,
it's a meaningless game...

1808
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:02,289
and we've taken
an avalanche of betting on it.

But Headake and the Sun Devils...

1810

to get it going.

dialed in, bro.

Set up, Headake.

Somebody want
to tell me?

1831
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:20,430
I just got a call from
the Athletic Director...

1832
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:22,066
who said the Pac-1 0
was asking him...

1833
01:10:22,142 --> 01:10:24,337
if he knew anything
about a fix on this game.

1834
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:25,742
And from the way you clowns
have been playing...

I'd say the whole
goddamn team is in on it!

Headake, you want to tell me
where you've been the first half?

Having some trouble
with my ankle, coach.

01:14:35,196 --> 01:14:37,687
cost me #1 million
of somebody else's money.

1905
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:39,733
I lost everything I had!
I swear, man!

1906
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,732
[Gun Cocks]

1907
01:14:40,801 --> 01:14:41,733
Aah!

1908
01:14:41,802 --> 01:14:42,734
Man: Benny!

1909
01:14:48,342 --> 01:14:50,105
- Who are you?
- Who the hell are you?

1910
01:14:50,177 --> 01:14:51,439
Better put that thing down, man.

1911
01:14:51,512 --> 01:14:52,740
Put yours down.
He owes me money.

1912
01:14:52,813 --> 01:14:53,973
I'm not going anywhere
till I get it.

1913
01:14:54,048 --> 01:14:55,106
Well, he owes me money!

1914
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:56,171
I don't care
who owes you money!

1915
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,376
Put your gun down!

1916
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:58,440
I ain't doin' nothin'!

1917
01:14:58,519 --> 01:14:59,451
Better put it down,
or I'm gonna waste ya.

1918
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,714
- Put it down!
- You put it down!

1919
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,483
Headake, get off me!

1920
01:15:02,556 --> 01:15:05,286
Benny: This was it.
The grand finale.

1921
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:08,920
If I was giving odds on
my own life at this point...

1922
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:11,487
me seeing tomorrow would've
been a long shot.

1923
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,715
Somehow...

1924
01:15:33,788 --> 01:15:36,621
I managed to talk
Brady and Big Red down...

1925
01:15:36,691 --> 01:15:39,717
by promising them
a nice chunk...

1926
01:15:39,794 --> 01:15:42,558
of Headake's NBA
signing bonus...

1927
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:45,030
he was sure to get.

1928
01:15:46,233 --> 01:15:50,397
I decided,
with all that was going on...

1929
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:54,805
plus the fact that
I screwed up with Callie...

1930
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:58,811
I'd come down to San Diego...

1931
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:00,210
and clear my head
a little bit...

1932
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:02,215
until the dust settled.

1933
01:16:02,283 --> 01:16:04,274
The Feds investigated the game...

1934
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,582
but since we won...

1935
01:16:06,654 --> 01:16:09,020
and by more
than the Vegas line...

1936
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:14,551
everybody assumed that
the rumors were just that...

1937
01:16:14,628 --> 01:16:15,560
rumors.

1938
01:16:15,629 --> 01:16:17,563
I thought
I got away with it.

1939
01:16:17,631 --> 01:16:19,496
Thing is...

1940
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:20,932
the only guy...

1941
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,367
who sees all
the difference of angles...

1942
01:16:23,437 --> 01:16:25,803
is the big man...

1943
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:28,000
upstairs.

1944
01:16:28,075 --> 01:16:30,270
That's because...

1945
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:34,181
he's got
that bird's-eye view.

1946
01:16:35,782 --> 01:16:38,182
Down here...

1947
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:41,345
you never know what's gonna
come around the corner.

1948
01:16:44,991 --> 01:16:46,322
Brady?

1949
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:48,054
- No. Wrong guy.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1950
01:16:48,128 --> 01:16:51,996
Agent Simms.
Agent Vasquez. FBI.

1951
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,396
We'd like to have
a word with you.

1952
01:16:53,466 --> 01:16:55,058
Why do you have
37 computers...

1953
01:16:55,135 --> 01:16:57,228
sitting in your
living room, Brady?

1954
01:16:57,304 --> 01:16:59,795
So I'm a computer whiz.
What's the big deal?

1955
01:16:59,873 --> 01:17:02,341
The big deal is those computers
were bought with stolen cards.

1956
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,341
Oh, come on.

1957
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,275
Sixty counts of fraud, Brady.

1958
01:17:05,345 --> 01:17:07,210
Plus, since you bought them
mail order...

1959
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,771
that's interstate
trafficking of stolen goods.

1960
01:17:09,849 --> 01:17:12,181
Conspiracy to move
stolen property.

1961
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:15,744
You're looking
at 1 0 years, kid.

1962
01:17:15,822 --> 01:17:16,789
Ten years?

1963
01:17:16,856 --> 01:17:18,187
It's ridiculous.
We're talking about...

1964
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:19,850
friggin' computers,
for Christ's sake...

1965
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:21,257
not human heads.

1966
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,068
What if I knew something?

1967
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:34,766
If I had some information.

1968
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:36,741
We're all ears.

1969
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,711
This is hot. It's real hot.
I want a deal.

1970
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:41,076
I'm not going to Attica...

1971
01:17:41,147 --> 01:17:42,808
for some overpriced
calculators, all right?

1972
01:17:42,882 --> 01:17:44,747
That depends
on what you know.

1973
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:52,992
You guys know anything
about college basketball?

1974
01:17:53,059 --> 01:17:54,617
Yeah. Yeah,
I knew Benny.

1975
01:17:54,694 --> 01:17:56,685
And you knew he was engaged
in illegal bookmaking?

1976
01:17:56,763 --> 01:17:58,230
Oh, yeah. I know
he was making book.

1977
01:17:58,298 --> 01:17:59,492
He was hanging out
with Headake Smith.

1978
01:17:59,566 --> 01:18:02,160
But I didn't know anything
about fixing games.

1979
01:18:02,235 --> 01:18:03,327
I don't know
anything about that.

1980
01:18:03,403 --> 01:18:05,166
It's important that you
tell us the truth, Adam.

1981
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:08,139
Other people have said
you were involved, son.

1982
01:18:10,243 --> 01:18:11,437
What other people?

1983
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:12,443
That's not important.

1984
01:18:12,512 --> 01:18:13,479
What is important is that...

1985
01:18:13,546 --> 01:18:14,672
if you don't
cooperate with us...

1986
01:18:14,748 --> 01:18:16,340
you're probably
gonna go to jail.

1987
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:18,281
[Laughs Nervously]

1988
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:19,545
Come on.

1989
01:18:23,923 --> 01:18:26,084
Now would you say
that you and Benny...

1990
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,387
are friends?

1991
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,035
No.

1992
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:39,765
We weren't really friends.

1993
01:18:39,839 --> 01:18:41,204
Get the hell outta here, man,
all right?

1994
01:18:41,274 --> 01:18:43,242
Benny never fixed no games.

1995
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:44,709
You know, you guys
have got to be crazy.

1996
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:45,710
Maybe he'd take a--

1997
01:18:45,779 --> 01:18:47,337
uh, he'd book a bet
here or there.

1998
01:18:47,414 --> 01:18:48,472
Not a big deal.

1999
01:18:48,548 --> 01:18:51,108
Other people have named
you as being involved.

2000
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:52,378
[Snickers]

2001
01:18:52,452 --> 01:18:54,511
You think you're
gonna get me...

2002
01:18:54,587 --> 01:18:56,452
to drop a dime
on my friend like that?

2003
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:59,253
Screw you guys.

2004
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:01,658
Screw you.

2005
01:19:01,728 --> 01:19:03,355
I'm not gonna answer
any more questions...

2006
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:04,590
till I get my lawyer.

2007
01:19:04,664 --> 01:19:06,256
And you know what?

2008
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:09,666
Even then, I might not
answer diddly.

2009
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:17,471
Yeah, I heard Benny and Headake
were shaving points...

2010
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:21,810
but everybody knew about it.

2011
01:19:21,881 --> 01:19:24,714
Even had some guy in Chicago
fronting the money on the games.

2012
01:19:24,784 --> 01:19:26,149
All right, Mr. Gagliano...

2013
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:27,516
this plea agreement
states that...

2014
01:19:27,587 --> 01:19:29,612
in exchange for
a lighter prison sentence...

2015
01:19:29,689 --> 01:19:31,919
you will cooperate with
the United States government...

2016
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:35,222
in its case
against Benny Silman.

2017
01:19:35,295 --> 01:19:37,855
You might want to read it.

2018
01:19:37,931 --> 01:19:40,058
What's the point?

2019
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:41,430
He made it sound simple.

2020
01:19:42,836 --> 01:19:45,430
So it was his idea?

2021
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:47,939
Yeah. There was nothin'
Benny wouldn't do for a buck.

2022
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:50,271
So why did you agree to do it?

2023
01:19:52,345 --> 01:19:54,279
I didn't have any option.

2024
01:19:54,347 --> 01:19:57,248
I was into him
for over #1 0,000.

2025
01:19:57,317 --> 01:20:00,844
He said the only way for me
to erase my debt was to fix games.

2026
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,514
The Feds have been building a case
against you for some time.

2027
01:20:04,924 --> 01:20:07,415
Do you know a Joe Gagliano?

2028
01:20:07,494 --> 01:20:10,691
Yeah, I know him.

2029
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,959
He just entered into
a plea agreement...

2030
01:20:13,032 --> 01:20:14,693
naming you
as the mastermind...

2031
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:16,736
behind this
point-shaving business.

2032
01:20:16,803 --> 01:20:18,361
Mastermind.

2033
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:20,303
A similar agreement
was entered into...

2034
01:20:20,373 --> 01:20:21,863
by a Stevin ''Headake'' Smith.

2035
01:20:21,941 --> 01:20:23,101
What?

2036
01:20:24,177 --> 01:20:26,077
What? No, no, no.

2037
01:20:26,146 --> 01:20:27,078
Hold up. Hold up.

2038
01:20:27,147 --> 01:20:28,079
He-He-He...

2039
01:20:28,148 --> 01:20:30,378
wanted to do it
as much as I did.

2040
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,781
Not according
to his statement.

2041
01:20:31,851 --> 01:20:34,649
Headake claims you approached
him with the idea...

2042
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,383
in order to erase #1 0,000
worth of debts he had incurred.

2043
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:38,389
He nev--

2044
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:41,586
He never owed me nothin',
all right?

2045
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:45,153
He was--
He was right there with me.

2046
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:48,166
He wanted to do it
as much as I did.

2047
01:20:48,234 --> 01:20:50,361
I got statements here
from friends of yours...

2048
01:20:50,437 --> 01:20:53,600
naming you as
the guy in charge.

2049
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:59,242
I can't believe this.

2050
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:02,577
You know a guy named
Shawn Pepello?

2051
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:03,809
Big Red.

2052
01:21:03,883 --> 01:21:07,080
They found him dead
of a heroin overdose...

2053
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:09,348
but you never know
in cases like this.

2054
01:21:09,422 --> 01:21:13,950
Word is he was in deep to a group
of people for a lot of money.

2055
01:21:14,027 --> 01:21:16,621
You're in some
serious trouble, Benny.

2056
01:21:16,696 --> 01:21:18,493
It's not just gonna disappear.

2057
01:21:19,566 --> 01:21:22,194
[Sighs]

2058
01:21:22,268 --> 01:21:24,498
Oh, my God.
What a surprise.

2059
01:21:24,571 --> 01:21:25,868
What are you doing home?

2060
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:28,999
Ma, I think I'm in trouble.

2061
01:21:29,075 --> 01:21:31,635
What did you do?

2062
01:21:31,711 --> 01:21:33,042
What did you do?

2063
01:21:33,112 --> 01:21:35,205
The indictment includes...

2064
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:37,078
Arizona State basketball player...

2065
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,050
Stevin ''Headake'' Smith...

2066
01:21:39,118 --> 01:21:41,586
and the alleged mastermind
of the operation...

2067
01:21:41,654 --> 01:21:45,492
22-year old Benjamin Silman
of New York.

2068
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:48,059
Who's going in front of
the judge today, me or you?

2069
01:21:48,127 --> 01:21:49,890
Well, I got the press out there...

2070
01:21:49,963 --> 01:21:50,952
they know who's going to be there.

2071
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,088
I gotta look good.

2072
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:53,393
What time is it?

2073
01:21:53,466 --> 01:21:54,490
Almost 2:00.

2074
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:55,932
[Knock On Door]

2075
01:21:56,002 --> 01:21:57,594
S'all right.

2076
01:22:00,673 --> 01:22:02,903
[Knock On Door]

2077
01:22:07,647 --> 01:22:08,579
[Gargles]

2078
01:22:08,648 --> 01:22:10,445
T-Bone:
There she is.

2079
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:11,484
Come on in.

2080
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,178
Benny!

2081
01:22:24,597 --> 01:22:26,189
Would you mind
if I meet you outside, T?

2082
01:22:26,266 --> 01:22:27,733
No. No sweat.

2083
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,290
See you, Callie.

2084
01:22:29,369 --> 01:22:31,564
I'm so happy you're here.

2085
01:22:31,638 --> 01:22:33,902
How you doing?

2086
01:22:33,973 --> 01:22:36,203
OK.

2087
01:22:36,276 --> 01:22:38,676
You look good.

2088
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:42,476
Yeah, like, for the judge,
you know?

2089
01:22:42,549 --> 01:22:43,777
Heard you graduated.

2090
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,442
Yeah. Finally.

2091
01:22:45,518 --> 01:22:47,008
I actually got offered
an internship...

2092
01:22:47,086 --> 01:22:49,247
at one of the top
architectural firms in L.A.

2093
01:22:49,322 --> 01:22:51,586
You did?
Congratulations.

2094
01:22:51,658 --> 01:22:53,091
Thanks.

2095
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:00,263
You believe this?
It's crazy.

2096
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:01,595
Yeah.

2097
01:23:01,668 --> 01:23:02,999
[Sighs]

2098
01:23:03,069 --> 01:23:05,401
I got, like, a really good lawyer
though, Callie.

2099
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:07,598
Like, he's one of the best
at this kind of thing.

2100
01:23:07,674 --> 01:23:09,835
He says I got a good shot
at walking away...

2101
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:12,810
because Headake had
considered fixing games...

2102
01:23:12,879 --> 01:23:14,710
- like, long before he met me.
- Don't.

2103
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:15,873
Don't.

2104
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,143
He thinks I can get out of this.

2105
01:23:17,216 --> 01:23:18,376
When are you gonna stop?

2106
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:19,440
Brady...

2107
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:20,816
you want to know
what he was involved in?

2108
01:23:20,887 --> 01:23:22,149
Callie, he was like--

2109
01:23:22,221 --> 01:23:24,314
Benny, you can't just
talk your way out of this one.

2110
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,379
I wasn't alone.

2111
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:27,449
Fine.
Maybe you weren't.

2112
01:23:27,527 --> 01:23:29,722
Maybe it wasn't even your idea.

2113
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:30,956
It wasn't. That's right.

2114
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,088
Well, that doesn't matter.

2115
01:23:32,165 --> 01:23:34,030
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

2116
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,728
I'm looking at four years, Callie.

2117
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,361
Four years.

2118
01:23:38,438 --> 01:23:40,463
Nobody else is looking at that.

2119
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,837
They wanted to do it.

2120
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:43,842
They turned on me.
All of them.

2121
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:46,378
Like, they pretended
to be my friends...

2122
01:23:46,446 --> 01:23:47,970
and then they dumped me.

2123
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:49,878
And, like, now,
I'm looking at four years.

2124
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:51,007
It's not fair.

2125
01:23:51,084 --> 01:23:53,644
You still did
what they said you did.

2126
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,813
It doesn't matter
what happens today...

2127
01:23:55,888 --> 01:23:57,412
that's not gonna change.

2128
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,048
You can...

2129
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,820
lie or manipulate
or maneuver...

2130
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:03,657
or do whatever fancy-lawyer
things you want to do...

2131
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:06,665
but that's not gonna change
that you did what you did.

2132
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:11,568
When are you gonna
own up to that, Benny?

2133
01:24:14,207 --> 01:24:15,367
[Door Opens]

2134
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:17,432
Yo, Ben. Sorry.

2135
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:18,442
We got to hit it, man.

2136
01:24:18,511 --> 01:24:20,308
It's about that time.
Come on.

2137
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:34,586
Benny:
The judge gave me four years.

2138
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:37,095
The indictment
included 61 bets...

2139
01:24:37,163 --> 01:24:41,031
totaling a half a million dollars
for the fourth game.

2140
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,069
Every one of those bets lost.

2141
01:24:44,137 --> 01:24:47,664
The Vegas sportsbooks
were the only winners.

2142
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:50,038
The house never loses.

2143
01:24:50,109 --> 01:24:53,237
[Gate Slams Shut]

2144
01:24:58,951 --> 01:25:01,283
My name is Benny Silman.

2145
01:25:01,354 --> 01:25:02,844
Up until recently...

2146
01:25:02,922 --> 01:25:07,291
I was inmate 43 207 008.

2147
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,385
I spent three years in prison...

2148
01:25:09,462 --> 01:25:13,296
and I still got 5 more years
of probation to go.

2149
01:25:13,366 --> 01:25:16,335
The Mangiameles,
they got home detention.

2150
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:18,893
Stevin ''Headake'' Smith
got one year in prison...

2151
01:25:18,971 --> 01:25:23,067
and lost his chances
of ever making the NBA.

2152
01:25:23,142 --> 01:25:24,632
I got a loving
mother and father...

2153
01:25:24,711 --> 01:25:27,737
who had to do harder time
than I did.

2154
01:25:27,814 --> 01:25:29,975
You know, for me,
doing the time was tough...

2155
01:25:30,049 --> 01:25:31,641
but for them, worrying about...

2156
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:33,583
what was going on
with me in prison...

2157
01:25:33,653 --> 01:25:35,245
was mind-boggling.

2158
01:25:35,321 --> 01:25:39,655
I can never say that
I'm never gonna gamble again.

2159
01:25:39,726 --> 01:25:42,524
All I can do is
take it one day at a time.

2160
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:44,563
And I can tell you
that right now, today...

2161
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:45,562
I'm not gonna gamble.

2162
01:25:45,631 --> 01:25:47,496
They say the house never loses.

2163
01:25:47,567 --> 01:25:50,798
This might be true.
I'm not really sure.

2164
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:53,031
But if it is true,
I'll tell you one thing...

2165
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,006
I definitely wasn't the house.

2166
01:25:55,074 --> 01:25:57,872
I had the money.
I had the action.

2167
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:02,142
I had the lifestyle.
I had the players...

2168
01:26:02,215 --> 01:26:03,648
and we still lost.

2169
01:26:03,716 --> 01:26:06,844
There's no such thing
as a sure thing in life.

2170
01:26:06,919 --> 01:26:08,944
And I'm a living example.
Look at me.

2171
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:11,216
What do I have to show
for all this?

2172
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:14,487
A felony. Three years in prison.

2173
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,688
Five more years of probation.

2174
01:26:17,764 --> 01:26:19,595
A struggle to get a job...

2175
01:26:19,665 --> 01:26:21,098
and I can't even vote.

2176
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:22,099
I mean...

2177
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:27,273
it's enough said right there.
