1
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:45,274
And now, the conclusion of
Judgment From Outer Space.

2
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:47,808
One of the primitives is trying
to activate Andros' key control.

3
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,212
Let her, Gorel.

4
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,414
If the correct signal isn't sent...

5
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:54,921
the satellite would automatically
destroy their planet.

6
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,083
We won't have to bother.

7
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:39,220
General, I just received a report
of an unidentified submarine.

8
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,926
A PBY spotted it this morning.

9
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,492
I checked AtCom
and none of our subs are in that area.

10
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,164
It could be the way of getting Andros
out of the country.

11
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,571
Red alert the anti-sub patrol
immediately...

12
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:50,974
and get every available PBY in the air.

13
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:54,013
I want that craft identified and seized.

14
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:55,979
We've got to get Andros back.

15
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:29,141
The Nazi humans
now have Andros prisoner...

16
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,377
and are taking him to their homeland.

17
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,916
How much more must we see
before the judgment is made?

18
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,318
Please, if you hear me...

19
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,054
wherever you are...

20
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,826
Andros has been captured by the Nazis...

21
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:58,234
and he needs whatever strength
and powers that you can give him.

22
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,066
He told me about his mission
here on Earth.

23
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,974
There are good people here,
people worth saving.

24
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,376
People who right now
are risking their lives...

25
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,781
to try to save a stranger like Andros.

26
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,182
If you can hear me...

27
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,288
please help.

28
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:24,322
I still say all humans are alike
and not worth saving.

29
00:06:24,397 --> 00:06:27,889
It is Andros' mission to decide that.

30
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:31,037
We cannot leave him without hope
as you would wish it.

31
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,004
Then leave him the spacecraft.

32
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,866
If he can gain his freedom...

33
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,501
and if his humans are civilized enough
to help him...

34
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,875
why, then, he's proved his point.

35
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,670
Otherwise...

36
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:45,249
Let him die? Alone, among savages?

37
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:47,286
Andros chose the test.

38
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:49,982
I call a vote.

39
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:18,380
As the Council has decided.

40
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:31,424
We've been searching all sections
of the north and south Atlantic...

41
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:32,988
for two weeks now.

42
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,968
We have to assume
that they've gotten away with Andros.

43
00:07:37,037 --> 00:07:39,631
I think we should proceed immediately
on the information...

44
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,697
Prime Minister Churchill gave you.

45
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,467
Yes, Mr. President.
I'll implement the plan immediately.

46
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,983
Churchill has told the President
that British Intelligence...

47
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:54,680
knows of a heavily secured
enemy intelligence interrogation center.

48
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:57,222
We feel sure that's
where they'll take Andros.

49
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,657
It's heavily guarded
and extremely difficult to penetrate.

50
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,354
But not impossible.

51
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:04,152
I'd like to volunteer to try.

52
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,596
- How soon can you leave for London?
- Tonight.

53
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,827
Diana can look after the office
while I'm gone.

54
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,096
Of course, sir.

55
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,003
I'll secure full cooperation
from the British.

56
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:16,337
This interrogation center, what's it called?

57
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,967
Schloss Markheim.

58
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,686
- I trust you will be comfortable.
- No matter, Mr. Bjornsen.

59
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,425
If you like you may wash, change clothes.

60
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,660
Dinner will be black tie in one hour.

61
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:43,327
And I'm invited?

62
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:45,496
You are the honored guest, Doctor.

63
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,040
Guest, of course.

64
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,249
Even given me a black tie.

65
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,902
- General Clewes.
- Yes.

66
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,774
You're admirably prompt, Major Trevor.

67
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:27,142
I had a good flight, sir.

68
00:09:27,213 --> 00:09:30,842
Yes, and God willing, an equally good one
over the Schwarzwald.

69
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,187
I'd like to have you meet Evan Mallory.

70
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:39,789
- Steve Trevor.
- My pleasure.

71
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:40,985
Thank you.

72
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,928
Mallory is going to guide you
to the Nazi Interrogation Center...

73
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:47,397
Located at Schloss Markheim.

74
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,300
You see, I have a very solid
false identity...

75
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,032
as a Nazi officer just returned
from the Russian front.

76
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:56,439
You'll have papers identifying you
as a technical aide on the mission.

77
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,340
Sounds like you've got everything set up.

78
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,242
- British efficiency.
- British!

79
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:02,577
Dear, no, my friend.

80
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,148
I'm Welsh.

81
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:07,381
It's a temporary alliance
against the Nazis, eh?

82
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,616
Welsh madman. But then, all the Welsh
are a bit mad.

83
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,358
That's possibly why
he's a most efficient secret agent.

84
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,691
- You're in good hands.
- I'm sure of it.

85
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,560
- When do we leave?
- Now. Within the hour.

86
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,862
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, General.

87
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,613
You're the busy one.

88
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:14,244
Got a lot of things to clear up
before this weekend.

89
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,185
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

90
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:18,747
The weekend. I thought maybe we could...

91
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,555
go down to the beach
and splash in the water...

92
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:23,323
lie on the sand...

93
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,023
maybe drum up a little interest.

94
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,828
I'd love to, but I've already
made plans for the weekend.

95
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,459
Really? What're you gonna do?

96
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:32,163
Well, you might say I'm going hunting.

97
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:36,002
Hunting? Diana, you couldn't hurt a fly.

98
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:38,574
I'm not going hunting to hurt anything.

99
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:40,839
I'm going to find something.

100
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:43,479
Hopefully.

101
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:09,097
You have no idea
of how this mechanism works?

102
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:12,303
Only that it connects
to some power source, sir.

103
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:15,438
I trust Dr. Graebner will soon tell us more.

104
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,213
We will begin analysis at once.

105
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,946
Question: This Andros will cooperate?

106
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:24,385
I think I can persuade him.

107
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,254
And if you cannot...

108
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,192
I have experts who can.

109
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:44,641
"Lieutenant Felzer. " Good papers.

110
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:46,105
The best.

111
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:49,108
There really is a Lieutenant Felzer.

112
00:12:49,282 --> 00:12:51,716
He's on the Eastern front.
He'd better stay there.

113
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,116
If he comes back, we will both be shot.

114
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,285
Dr. Andros, welcome to Markheim!

115
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:30,288
May I introduce Colonel-General
Heinrich Von Dreiberg.

116
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:33,883
- Dr. Andros.
- No "Doctor," please. Just Andros.

117
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:37,592
On my planet, we've given up
the custom of using titles.

118
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:42,023
I'm Professor Graebner
of the Ministry of Science.

119
00:13:42,468 --> 00:13:45,266
And you, Dr. Andros, are you...

120
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:48,304
an alien from outer space?

121
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,975
I'm precisely what I claim to be.

122
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,636
But you are involved in atom research?

123
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:57,841
No, we completed
our atomic research long ago.

124
00:13:57,984 --> 00:14:00,976
Now our children learn
atomic and sub-atomic physics...

125
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,681
in primary school much as
your children learn primitive fire making.

126
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,989
Very interesting, Doctor.

127
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:13,226
But let us leave serious talk for later.
Now, dinner.

128
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,130
May I introduce Fräulein Engel.

129
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,095
Shall we go in?

130
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,267
Bjornsen.

131
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:32,044
He is impertinent.

132
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:35,777
And the ridiculous cover story
about an alien from outer space.

133
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:39,757
Gentlemen, he has already admitted
his connection to atom research.

134
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:44,457
We are convinced he is a key scientist
in the Allied scientific establishment...

135
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,498
but like many scientists, he is naive.

136
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,863
I think I can persuade him
to join our cause.

137
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:51,797
And if you can't?

138
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:55,732
Sir, perhaps Fräulein Engel can.

139
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,137
I promised you, Andros...

140
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:35,570
that we'd have a chance
to talk more privately.

141
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,138
And more pleasantly.

142
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,843
Well, I'm flattered.

143
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,254
Thank you.

144
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,185
Prosit.

145
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,802
It's beautiful, bubbly.

146
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,502
It's alive.

147
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,737
It's too bad the sparkle
is so short-lived...

148
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:07,436
and then it's dead.

149
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,846
Tell me something.

150
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,211
Why do you let yourself be used like this?

151
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,516
A charming object...

152
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,019
sent off to seduce a stranger.

153
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,651
Love isn't a commodity.

154
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,496
It is at least, a gift...

155
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:26,893
at best, a sharing.

156
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:31,728
You remember when you were a little girl?

157
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,406
The ocean sunrises over Wesermunde.

158
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:40,505
The golden dreams
of a knight come riding.

159
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,012
How did you know?

160
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,610
And the girl who knew she was beautiful.

161
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,148
No!

162
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,196
Touching.

163
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:06,131
I see you've decided
to communicate with me again.

164
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:09,402
You do have faith
in these primitives, Andros.

165
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:12,944
It is a quality the Council needs.

166
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,507
I'm exercising my privilege.

167
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:20,612
I'm canceling the Judgment's survey
and bringing you back.

168
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,382
And this planet Earth?

169
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,314
Destroyed, of course.

170
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:26,914
No.

171
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,727
Andros, you must realize...

172
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:32,855
your romantic faith
in these humans is false.

173
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,127
They've captured you. They will kill you.

174
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,630
No, they're not all savages.

175
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,799
I'm an anachronism, Gorel.

176
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,241
I'm a romantic. I still have faith.

177
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,044
You're wrong.

178
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,539
These people are savages.

179
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,679
And if they kill you, Andros...

180
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,510
I will lose a friend.

181
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:59,023
And their planet will be destroyed
in any case.

182
00:18:31,357 --> 00:18:34,622
You have quite a remarkable collection
of artworks.

183
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:39,092
An example
of our historic culture, Andros.

184
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,567
Seize her!

185
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,297
Come on, I'll get you out.

186
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:50,365
No, wait!

187
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,304
Wonder Woman, I can't leave yet.

188
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:56,041
There's much to learn here
before I make a judgment.

189
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:59,050
They're holding you prisoner!
They are Nazis.

190
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,215
Yes, they are Nazis.

191
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,448
Your friends
are Republicans and Democrats.

192
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:06,958
The Russians are Communists.
All different, all human.

193
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:10,527
I told you, I intend to meet
the leaders of humankind.

194
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,755
- Including the Nazis?
- Yes.

195
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,006
You brought me here by force...

196
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,238
but I would stay
of my own will and necessity...

197
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:30,111
- if you do not harm Wonder Woman.
- Of course.

198
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,316
We'll make you a good Nazi yet, Andros!

199
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:35,877
At the very least,
you are an honored guest.

200
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,924
And you are quite a different kind of guest.

201
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,690
Take them away.

202
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,972
There is no doubt she is an Allied agent,
this Wonder Woman.

203
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,575
So why do we play games, Bjornsen?

204
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:02,172
Take her below and have her questioned.

205
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,773
Questioned scientifically.

206
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,085
With all due respect, I disagree.

207
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:10,588
This Wonder Woman has been involved...

208
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,318
in some very curious episodes in the past.

209
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:16,555
There are reports
of extraordinary physical strength...

210
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:19,120
- speed...
- Utter nonsense.

211
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:20,721
She is a woman!

212
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:24,865
An unusual woman?

213
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,375
I suspect an experimental agent.

214
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:37,405
Perhaps the result of scientific processing.

215
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:43,054
Connected with this Dr. Andros?

216
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:44,717
Very possibly.

217
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,157
So I have arranged to leave them together.

218
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:50,793
Privately...

219
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,563
so to speak.

220
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,926
I don't understand...

221
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:02,471
how you can be friendly with the Nazis
when they've taken you prisoner!

222
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,202
So did the Americans.

223
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,336
But that was different,
for temporary security.

224
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:12,179
Americans don't make arbitrary arrests
or use concentration camps.

225
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:17,112
I think you better explain that
to Americans of Japanese descent.

226
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:22,588
Democracies are not perfect.
I mean, there are...

227
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,891
mistakes made
but not warfare against civilians.

228
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,033
Not deliberate torture.

229
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:33,395
Distinctions, not necessarily differences.

230
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,472
I'm not interested in national squabbles.
I am here to study humanity.

231
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:40,668
Or inhumanity.

232
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:43,814
And you have no feelings,
one way or the other?

233
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:46,010
I have very strong feelings.

234
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:49,682
That's why I cannot indulge them,
believe me.

235
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:52,851
I'm as vulnerable as you are.

236
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,214
No.

237
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:59,289
You're a guest of Bjornsen,
and his Nazi masters!

238
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:02,198
Bjornsen is a Nazi
but all Germans are not Nazis.

239
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:06,361
I cannot judge him, or his beliefs
until I understand them both.

240
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,006
I am a prisoner, and thanks to you,
they have my Belt and my Lasso...

241
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,940
so I am as helpless as you.

242
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:17,244
Or else you would be
trying to tear this castle to pieces.

243
00:22:17,316 --> 00:22:18,305
Yes.

244
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:21,416
Who would be waging warfare then?

245
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,820
A few more days,
and he will be on our side.

246
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:31,718
Good.

247
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:35,795
I will need his help. I must confess...

248
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:41,137
as of yet I don't understand the scientific
principles behind his mechanism...

249
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:45,575
or the devices of that woman agent.

250
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,544
Andros will cooperate.

251
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:49,613
As for Wonder Woman...

252
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,238
No.

253
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,548
Nothing...

254
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,316
will happen to her.

255
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:01,183
Until she gives us
the information we want.

256
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,257
I'll be careful.

257
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:17,667
All in order, Captain Braun.

258
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:22,736
But your case is slightly different,
Lieutenant Felzer.

259
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,344
In what way?

260
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,681
Your papers indicate you have recently
served on the Eastern front...

261
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:30,483
- von Paulus' command.
- Yes. So?

262
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:34,525
As it happens, we have another man
just back from the Eastern front...

263
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:39,488
Lieutenant Berghoff, also served
under von Paulus, also in headquarters.

264
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:44,334
You two must have known each other.

265
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:48,572
Of course, it's possible, Captain Grau.

266
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:50,637
I'd like to meet him.

267
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,506
- Lieutenant Felzer.
- Sir?

268
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,705
You have forgotten,
your social life must wait...

269
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,476
until after we have delivered
the dispatches.

270
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:01,280
Your General von Dreiberg
is waiting for them personally.

271
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:02,945
If they are delayed...

272
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:06,485
Lieutenant Felzer will undoubtedly
return to the Eastern front.

273
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,322
- And we will accompany him.
- I apologize, sir!

274
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:12,394
Of course we can't have delays...

275
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:16,398
but I had Berghoff notified,
he was eager to meet an old comrade.

276
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:18,329
Some other time.

277
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:24,002
Dispatches for General von Dreiberg.

278
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:25,933
Thank you, Captain.

279
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:41,556
I'm only asking
for a few simple explanations.

280
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,956
We realize, of course,
that these devices are connected...

281
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,396
to your American atom research.

282
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:48,997
Nonsense.

283
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:52,302
I expected you to be stubborn.

284
00:24:53,706 --> 00:24:57,540
But you, Dr. Andros,
I'm sure you can give us some details?

285
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:01,612
Do the Americans
have an atom bomb yet?

286
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:05,043
Herr Bjornsen, I'm here
to meet with your leaders.

287
00:25:05,117 --> 00:25:07,642
Not discuss dangerous toys.

288
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:11,989
You call the most powerful
explosive device...

289
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:14,753
known to scientific theory a toy?

290
00:25:15,594 --> 00:25:18,358
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be condescending.

291
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,523
But my people discovered basic atomics...

292
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,760
some thousands of your years ago and...

293
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:24,999
we experimented with it...

294
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,335
and then outgrew
the uses of such power, such weapons.

295
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:33,108
We developed other uses: More effective,
less clumsy and polluting.

296
00:25:33,612 --> 00:25:36,604
- Enough of this other-world nonsense!
- Please.

297
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:38,810
Let him continue.

298
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:43,579
We know planets where
atomic explosives were discovered...

299
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:46,283
leading to war and destruction...

300
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:51,159
and the planets did not survive.
Earth is entering the atomic age...

301
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,960
and if you do not outgrow
your emotional primitivism...

302
00:25:56,835 --> 00:25:59,736
you'll destroy yourselves, and others.

303
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,735
It is that we cannot allow.

304
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:19,082
Where's Felzer? Sorry.

305
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:24,125
I'm Lieutenant Berghoff. Felzer and I
were pretty close on the Eastern front.

306
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:26,225
Berghoff, too bad!

307
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:30,796
You just missed him.
He just went through a few minutes ago.

308
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:33,963
Then, perhaps, I can see him
when he comes out.

309
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:37,530
He still has a uniform of mine
that he borrowed...

310
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,740
and I'd like to get it back.

311
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:43,104
It must have been
a very loose fit on you, Lieutenant.

312
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,713
No, as a matter of fact...

313
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,514
it's just about the best-fitting
uniform I own.

314
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,680
But you can't be more than 5'9", 5'10"...

315
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,192
Felzer's at least 6'2", 6'3".

316
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,285
Georg Felzer?

317
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:02,965
Impossible. He and I are
exactly the same height!

318
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,428
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

319
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:11,005
Whoever he is, that man's an imposter.

320
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:19,572
Get me Oberst Bjornsen at once.
Emergency!

321
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:23,148
I see.

322
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:27,389
Thank you, Captain Grau. We'll handle it.

323
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:42,539
General Von Dreiberg.

324
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:46,343
Major Trevor, how nice to see you again.

325
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,450
Disarm them!

326
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:04,893
Wonder Woman, you, too?

327
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:09,956
I came to free Andros.
But he doesn't want to be freed.

328
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,071
Dr. Andros has become friendly.

329
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:17,400
But I think, Doctor, the time has come...

330
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:21,003
for you to give us a concrete
demonstration of that friendship.

331
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:24,347
To be specific:

332
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:28,544
We know you're a key scientist
in the American atom program.

333
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,822
We've been patient.

334
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:36,251
Those colorful stories of alien space.

335
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,758
But now: Facts.

336
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,926
- I told you.
- You told us charming fairytales!

337
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,663
The Third Reich is at war.
We need weapons. Atomic weapons.

338
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:46,995
No.

339
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,635
I think you're confused, Doctor.

340
00:28:53,312 --> 00:28:55,280
I'm not asking you politely.

341
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:58,311
I have the top American female agent...

342
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:02,280
the head of
an American Intelligence operation...

343
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:05,981
and the leading British spy
in the Third Reich!

344
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,158
I have them! And you will see them die!

345
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:15,625
- You don't understand! Why don't you...
- It is you who does not understand.

346
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,262
The talk is over!

347
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:22,129
Take them down. For questioning.

348
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,458
I'd get nightmares like this.

349
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:53,299
But I wasn't lucky enough
to have you in them, Princess.

350
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:57,069
This leads to the wine cellar,
which we have enlarged.

351
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:01,642
This whole section of the foundation
was carved out of living rock.

352
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,181
It took us a year
and a good deal of forced labor.

353
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:09,249
The ultimate plague:
Man's inhumanity to man.

354
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:12,048
Rather the strong's use of the weak.

355
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,221
Not pretty, Dr. Andros,
but the truth behind...

356
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,625
all power, all governments: Strength.

357
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,990
The strength of a frightened, evil child...

358
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,895
too terrified to trust in gentleness.

359
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,600
Only in paradise, Wonder Woman.

360
00:30:31,243 --> 00:30:32,642
I hope not.

361
00:30:37,716 --> 00:30:40,981
You will see we have modernized it a bit.

362
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:50,024
Have them cover all exits.

363
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:52,890
Put them in there.

364
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,093
We'll go to the laboratory.

365
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:58,796
Get your hands off...

366
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,998
Don't confuse heroism with stupidity.

367
00:31:02,074 --> 00:31:04,872
You are a hundred meters down in
the heart of the mountain.

368
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:06,877
You have very few options.

369
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:09,139
He's right, Steve, for now.

370
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:12,682
Look, you, the war isn't over yet.

371
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,843
But don't worry, Colonel.

372
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:19,788
I'll notify you when we've won.
If you're still alive.

373
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:38,100
Professor Graebner has been
examining your devices.

374
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:43,504
And I must admit, up till now
I've made very little progress.

375
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:47,416
This is clearly a control mechanism
of some kind...

376
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:50,649
operating on electronic principles.

377
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,386
These artifacts...

378
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,184
They are gifts.

379
00:31:57,963 --> 00:31:59,726
But what do they do?

380
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:03,556
How do they function?
I want detailed technical data.

381
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:05,331
There are none.

382
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:08,496
- You're being stubborn.
- And stupid!

383
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:13,237
Let us start with your device,
Dr. Andros. You will explain it.

384
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,904
Even if I were willing,
it would be impossible.

385
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:18,381
You don't have the scientific knowledge.

386
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,917
It's not a machine.

387
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:23,016
It's part of my mind,
perhaps, part of my soul.

388
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:26,615
That is mystic nonsense, and I want facts!

389
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,123
I'm sorry. No.

390
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,359
I'm disappointed, Andros.

391
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,688
Let me be clear.

392
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:36,727
If you refuse to cooperate...

393
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:39,562
- You'll use force on me?
- No.

394
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,268
On her.

395
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,171
While you watch.

396
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:54,144
They are savages.

397
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,788
They have convinced me.

398
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:00,614
You are right.

399
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:05,522
I am a terrible threat to your planet,
and yet you are here...

400
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:07,758
at risk of life, to help me...

401
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,868
and so is Major Trevor, and Evan Mallory.

402
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:13,229
The Americans, the Allies...

403
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:16,968
they have human virtues, human flaws...

404
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:22,173
- but the Nazis...
- I don't need a lecture on ethics!

405
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,541
Nor would you understand it.

406
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,915
You spoke to me
of your cultural inheritance.

407
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,454
Your inheritance is in a direct line
with Genghis Khan, Attila.

408
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:36,618
You celebrate the darkness
in the human soul.

409
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:38,819
Start on her!

410
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,689
Gorel!

411
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,091
Stop her!

412
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:42,890
If we could break up this bunk
we could use it as a battering ram.

413
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,689
Lock all the exits, stop Wonder Woman.

414
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,822
Whatever happened, my dear princess...

415
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:57,367
your coming here to help me
has renewed my faith in humankind.

416
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:03,799
I'm stripped of my powers.

417
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:10,408
The only way I can return to my spacecraft
safely is with human help.

418
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,780
And I will have made a point.

419
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,781
If I'm killed...

420
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:19,051
Then it would prove we aren't civilized.

421
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,282
And then Earth...

422
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:23,619
Would end.

423
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:28,962
And you have risked your life for us.

424
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,193
No, for what I believe in.

425
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:34,271
I don't risk my life:

426
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,904
My life is what I believe in.

427
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:12,301
Too bloody well-made,
bloody perfectionists.

428
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:41,467
Go after them.

429
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:56,476
That way!

430
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:28,307
Go on.

431
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,098
No, she's here to help us.

432
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:48,002
- How do you know you can trust her?
- Andros knows.

433
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,377
I don't care about the rest of you
but I won't see him killed!

434
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:54,667
This way.

435
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,058
A secret exit. In case of heavy bombing.

436
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:20,798
You can break the door, there's a
tunnel that leads past the security points.

437
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:21,861
Thank you.

438
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:26,600
- Thank you, Lisa.
- Don't.

439
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:29,942
- I don't even know why.
- I do.

440
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:34,245
And when that knight comes riding
he'll know, too.

441
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,797
I'm no longer important...

442
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,498
but Wonder Woman is. Surely
by now you've seen the potential...

443
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,971
for good in humans.

444
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:59,737
Wonder Woman is the hope
of the human race.

445
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:03,076
The hope of this entire misguided planet.

446
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:06,482
Grant me back my powers
that I may help her.

447
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:18,428
Do you have your powers back?

448
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,798
Yes, because of you.

449
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,838
- Has the decision been reached, Andros?
- Yes.

450
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:40,244
We found war, violence...

451
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:43,280
injustice and torture.

452
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:48,018
Your planet is troubled.
Humankind is flawed with self-destruction.

453
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:49,987
But that is only a flaw.

454
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,719
It's the disease of racial childhood.

455
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,263
I found a balance.

456
00:40:54,632 --> 00:40:57,294
And I remember how you gave me back
my power:

457
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:59,427
Freely, ethically.

458
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,298
Then the Earth won't be destroyed?

459
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:05,865
No, the spirit be thanked.
I won a vote in the Council.

460
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,777
Fifty of your years, Princess.

461
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:15,984
I am empowered to grant you that:
50 years.

462
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:19,316
And you'll have atomic power...

463
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,119
you'll begin to explore space...

464
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:25,253
- I hope you discover answers.
- We will.

465
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,930
No, we may.

466
00:41:33,071 --> 00:41:34,504
It's a question.

467
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:39,299
Perhaps the next 50 years
will give us something of an answer.

468
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:43,038
I can answer in regards to you, Princess.

469
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,647
And I can offer you an invitation.

470
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:48,151
Come with me.

471
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:52,117
- Into space?
- Yes, to the real world.

472
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,024
A planet of water,
and a civilization of dolphins...

473
00:41:56,794 --> 00:42:01,026
a planet of gardens,
where you can meet plant intelligences...

474
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:04,234
a planet where
the gravity allows you to fly.

475
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:06,563
There are thousands of worlds...

476
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:09,902
you can see them,
you can even taste them if you wish.

477
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:12,742
Then spend some time with me.

478
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:15,034
Us.

479
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:18,612
On my home.

480
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:23,513
I can't. Andros, I'm pledged as well...

481
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:25,720
to my Earth...

482
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:28,784
humanity and my destiny.

483
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:30,859
Of course.

484
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:35,989
It's only 50 years.

485
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:43,404
In 1992, I'll be back and renew my offer.

486
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:05,649
Hi, Diana.

487
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:09,791
The General still in with Steve?

488
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:14,387
I know that look.

489
00:44:15,533 --> 00:44:16,864
Who's the fella?

490
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:19,360
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

491
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:21,564
I said you were thinking about a guy.

492
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,268
And I want to hear all about it,
in minute detail.

493
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:28,877
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking about someone...

494
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:32,783
- but by this time he is very far away.
- Overseas?

495
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:35,116
You might say so.

496
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:37,981
Don't worry, he'll be back.

497
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:42,082
I'm not worried. He'll come back,
I know, he promised.

498
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:44,559
And he seems to be a man of his word.

499
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:51,094
The White House just called. The President
wants your final report on Andros.

500
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:52,797
Final report?

501
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:55,498
The man's vanished
from the face of the earth...

502
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:58,201
that's about the only final report
I can make.

503
00:45:00,645 --> 00:45:01,907
The General's right.

504
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:05,471
How do we know it's a final report
if we can't find a trace of Andros?

505
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:09,383
From what you told me, Andros was
the most honest man you'd ever met...

506
00:45:09,654 --> 00:45:12,885
he said he was going back
to his own planet, why doubt him?

507
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:13,946
I don't.

508
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:17,718
I guess I'm just a little jealous,
that's all.

509
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:21,830
I saw the way Wonder Woman
looked at him...

510
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:24,966
and just wanted to make 100% sure
he is gone.

511
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:28,062
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

512
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:30,699
No matter how much Andros
would have wanted...

513
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,709
Wonder Woman to go back with him...

514
00:45:32,777 --> 00:45:35,610
I'm sure she'd rather stay here with you.

515
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:37,475
With us.

516
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:38,497
