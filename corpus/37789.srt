1
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,889
Stay down.

2
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:02,598
Freeze! Just freeze.

3
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,144
Your hands ever shake, Frank?

4
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:47,882
Sometimes.

5
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,544
lt's just adrenaline.

6
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:57,887
Of course.

7
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:59,792
How did you know?

8
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,562
-l saw him washing the car.
-So did l.

9
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,065
They don't wash cars
on the parking levels.

10
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,741
Frank...

11
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,812
...l'd like you to stay on.

12
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,678
l'm no good in a permanent position.

13
00:02:22,254 --> 00:02:23,983
My feet go to sleep.

14
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:51,271
You're turning down $2,000 a week?

15
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:57,838
So you won't protect Rachel Marron
because she's in show business?

16
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,574
l don't do celebrities.

17
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:01,174
2500.

18
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:03,583
There's many good men for that much.

19
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,086
Have you talked to...

20
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:07,348
...Racine, Fitzgerald...

21
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,086
...Portman?

22
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:10,852
Portman's interested.

23
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:13,787
But we heard you were the best.

24
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,362
There's no such thing.

25
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:21,362
We're talking about a very frightened
lady with an 8-year-old son.

26
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:24,439
l wouldn't be here if l
didn't think this was real.

27
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,202
Farmer, she begged me to get you.

28
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:31,548
Please.

29
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,941
Okay, l'll come.

30
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,047
l'll look the situation over.

31
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,219
lf l take it...

32
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:42,453
...it's 3000 a week.

33
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:46,328
You must be very deadly
for 3 grand a week.

34
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,622
Watch and see.

35
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,460
Shit.

36
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,072
lt's something.

37
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,607
Sorry.

38
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,646
Don't stand there, either.

39
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:02,203
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.

40
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,136
What?

41
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,639
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.

42
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,210
Got an appointment?

43
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,988
The atomic number of zinc is thirty.

44
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:21,817
All right.

45
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,385
Can l help you?

46
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,625
You the man on the intercom?

47
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,634
Can l help you?

48
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,133
My name's Edison.
l have an appointment.

49
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,503
Arranged by...?

50
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:46,475
Mr. Devaney.

51
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,639
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.

52
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,310
What happened?

53
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:56,515
A doll.

54
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:14,633
Henry Ford to see Mr. Devaney.

55
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,070
Who?

56
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,467
Henry Ford.

57
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,399
Come in.

58
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,208
Playback, everybody.

59
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,483
That's what l want.

60
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,723
Glad you came. Come on.
l'll introduce you to Rachel.

61
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:48,989
l bet you loved it.

62
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:52,497
-He doesn't know great art.
-Frank Farmer's here.

63
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,400
-Do you think this is me?
-lt's terrific.

64
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,171
-Frank Farmer's here.
-Who?

65
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,071
Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.

66
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,576
l think Rory should be my bodyguard.

67
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,240
Raise your butt and come meet him.

68
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,352
All right. l'm up.

69
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,590
Frank Farmer...

70
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,084
...Rachel Marron.

71
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,928
You don't look like a bodyguard.

72
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,198
What'd you expect?

73
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,603
Maybe a tough guy.

74
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:32,599
This is my disguise.

75
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,377
His timing's good.

76
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:40,611
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
and personal secretary.

77
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,218
Nice to meet you.

78
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:43,285
Tony Scibelli.

79
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:46,455
Sy Spector, publicist.

80
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:50,125
Can we get you a drink?

81
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:52,126
An orange juice.

82
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:53,786
Straight?

83
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,732
This is Bill's idea.

84
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:06,403
A sudden obsession with protecting me.

85
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:09,911
Tony's always done my security
and we've done just fine.

86
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:11,571
ls this what we talked about?

87
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:14,650
Bill's right. lt's time
you took more precautions.

88
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,981
l'm sure they'll say the number of
nuts writing fan letters jumps...

89
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:21,148
...whenever Rachel's on a magazine.

90
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,657
Not like this.

91
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:24,419
Relax, guys.

92
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:28,157
l said l'll do it, so l will.
See what l'm dealing with?

93
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,764
l'll do this as long as
we understand each other.

94
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:34,663
l won't let this thing alter my life.

95
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,000
Honey, that won't be a problem.

96
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:41,009
Rachel's household is informal.
We're all on a first-name basis.

97
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,771
You'll fit in fine.

98
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:45,939
Choose whatever alarm system
you want for the house.

99
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,847
lmproved security for the gate.
What else?

100
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,851
What else?

101
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:54,118
l think l'm safe when l'm at the house.

102
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,852
-So the main thing is when l go out.
-Exactly.

103
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:01,124
Tony will fill you in. l don't want you
falling all over me everywhere l go.

104
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:05,525
Fletcher cannot be affected.

105
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:09,139
l'll cover that. We'll tell him
you've got some other function.

106
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:13,300
l don't want him to think he's in prison.
So the estate must not be altered.

107
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:16,038
He shouldn't even know you're here.

108
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,049
There's been a misunderstanding.

109
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:23,051
So if you'll show me the way out,
l'll save us both trouble.

110
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:24,188
By the pool.

111
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:29,150
lt was nice meeting you.

112
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:30,552
Or the entry door.

113
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:33,159
Shut up. Wait a minute!

114
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:35,231
We shouldn't beg this guy.

115
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,166
l'm handling this. Farmer,
would you wait a minute?

116
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,673
l should have told you more.
l was afraid she wouldn't do it.

117
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:48,334
l thought l'd let you two work it out.

118
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,571
We did.

119
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:53,740
She's not a bad person and whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.

120
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:58,919
You've come this far, wait a moment.
l must show you something.

121
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,024
Please, Farmer.

122
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:28,942
How are you today?

123
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:32,049
Fine. And you?

124
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:35,117
Oh, l'm fine. Do you like boats?

125
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:39,786
No, l don't like boats.

126
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:41,654
Why not?

127
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:42,957
l don't know.

128
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:46,733
Sure you do. But you
don't want to tell me.

129
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:49,230
You're a smart kid.

130
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:53,468
One time l was...

131
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:56,808
...stuck on a boat with
some people for 4 months.

132
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:58,139
A lifeboat?

133
00:13:58,483 --> 00:13:59,973
No, it was a...

134
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:02,082
...big, white yacht.

135
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:05,313
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?

136
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,980
What do you know about it?

137
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,915
l've got ears.

138
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:12,087
l'll remember that.

139
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,493
This is just in the last 6 months.

140
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,171
Have you ever had these
professionally assessed?

141
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:26,440
-l heard you were in the Secret Service.
-That's right.

142
00:14:27,678 --> 00:14:29,009
You guard the main man?

143
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:32,776
l was 2 years with
Carter, 4 with Reagan.

144
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:34,448
Reagan got shot.

145
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,278
Not on my shift.

146
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:41,046
Good.

147
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,953
This could be something.

148
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,791
Do you think it could be the
same guy who rigged the doll?

149
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,130
Did you tell Miss Marron?

150
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:54,965
About the doll?

151
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:59,542
We said there'd been an electrical
problem, like a short circuit.

152
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:04,808
She doesn't need this kind of worry.
lt'd really upset her.

153
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,040
What about the police?

154
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:09,209
No need. No one got hurt.

155
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:10,877
The chauffeur got hurt.

156
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:12,822
That was nothing.

157
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:15,214
lt was just our people there.

158
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:19,323
l think we should show him the room.

159
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,570
ls this her bedroom?

160
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,911
She sleeps in the room next
to Fletcher's down the hall.

161
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,681
Sy had this done for a magazine layout.

162
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,586
Superstars in their boudoirs.

163
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:48,850
Did you see it?

164
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,521
We found the letter here.

165
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:58,895
Someone was in here?

166
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:02,197
Someone broke in and
masturbated on the bed.

167
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,034
-And she doesn't know?
-Are you kidding?

168
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:09,941
lt'd really freak her out.

169
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,547
What do you think?

170
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:17,117
Someone penetrates the house...

171
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:20,551
...gets upstairs, jerks off on the bed.
l'd say...

172
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,619
...that qualifies as a problem.

173
00:16:22,793 --> 00:16:24,283
We don't need this.

174
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:25,427
What kind?

175
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,722
-The house is wide open.
-Excuse me?

176
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,231
The house is wide open.

177
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:35,235
You people have no clue what
security is or how to achieve it.

178
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:37,738
l'll accommodate your work.

179
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,308
l can't protect her like this.

180
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:40,409
Like what?

181
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:45,471
l won't be responsible for her safety
if she doesn't know what's going on.

182
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,739
l'll make her understand.

183
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,088
l'll talk to her.

184
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:03,266
She won't give you any static.
You have my word.

185
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:04,492
Sure she will.

186
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,936
So what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard, aren't you?

187
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,631
Guess what? lt's Oscar time again.

188
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:43,706
This year the money's on Rachel
Marron for best actress.

189
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:47,374
And with the theme song
of ''l Have Nothing''...

190
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:49,203
...still big on the charts...

191
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,215
...the versatile actress/singer
might end up having everything.

192
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:21,334
Why'd you say your name was Edison?

193
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:24,072
To see how difficult it was to get in.

194
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,176
And it wasn't.

195
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,528
-Put it on your arm.
-What's this?

196
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,432
lt'll stop the ache.

197
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,036
l bet you can fill up a whole day
washing cars and driving Miss Marron.

198
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:55,772
That's my job.

199
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:59,279
We're adding to your duties.

200
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:01,811
You're my new assistant.

201
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,119
Says who?

202
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:11,788
l've spent a lot of time guarding people
and l've found one thing to be true.

203
00:19:12,563 --> 00:19:16,897
No matter how incompetent the assassins,
or how much they miss their target...

204
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:19,559
...one person always gets hit.

205
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:21,960
Who?

206
00:19:23,974 --> 00:19:25,305
The cocky black chauffeur.

207
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,637
Put this in the pool.

208
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:45,153
This gate will be replaced next week.
l'll have 2 cameras here.

209
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:47,422
A face camera by the call box...

210
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:51,324
...and a scene camera on top
of this pillar, looking down.

211
00:19:51,602 --> 00:19:56,164
l want these trees to be cut back so
the lights can shine onto the property.

212
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,606
And the people who come into the
property, make sure who they are.

213
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:06,009
l want these all cut back, okay?

214
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:09,778
She paid a lot for the estate,
she ought to be able to see it.

215
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:14,849
-What're you looking at?
-Frank.

216
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,455
This fence is going to come around
this area and end by the gate.

217
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:23,458
Come on. Let's go.

218
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,636
Not yet, not yet, not yet. Now brake!

219
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:34,867
Power.

220
00:20:36,647 --> 00:20:37,705
Stop.

221
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:03,738
Come here!

222
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:05,735
Come here.

223
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:12,406
That's an unusual tactic for a
guard dog. But it's effective.

224
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,574
You can look around if you want.

225
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,411
Sorry to disturb you.

226
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:20,182
lt's okay. lt's an excuse to rest.

227
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:24,361
This is my personal place.
l'm the only one who works out here.

228
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,602
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.

229
00:21:36,106 --> 00:21:37,869
This is you and Rachel?

230
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:42,940
When l was a kid, l put
together this little band.

231
00:21:43,113 --> 00:21:45,775
We played school dances
and stuff like that.

232
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:50,280
Rachel joined the act
and as you can imagine...

233
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:52,784
...she was quite an entertainer.

234
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:57,554
Even then she could stop the show.

235
00:21:58,128 --> 00:21:59,220
So....

236
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,452
l quit.

237
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:02,292
Professionally, anyway.

238
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,956
You never went back?

239
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:07,466
lt was pretty obvious who
the star in our family was.

240
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:14,643
Lot of work went into this.

241
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:15,904
Lot of work.

242
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,138
No fingerprints, though.

243
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:21,081
You think this is tied to the doll?

244
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:22,979
Her manager does.

245
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:27,456
''l have nothing'' is natural,
given the record, the movie.

246
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,990
l lost track of you after Washington.

247
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:40,600
How's the private stuff?

248
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:42,769
lt's fine.

249
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,333
Big money?

250
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,101
lt's big money, right?

251
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:50,512
You wouldn't want this job.

252
00:22:52,516 --> 00:22:55,952
lt is big money! Fuck! l knew it!
You need an assistant?

253
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,954
l'm due to get out of here and l
have had it with assholic behavior.

254
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,456
What a scumbag we're covering now.

255
00:23:02,626 --> 00:23:05,959
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.

256
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,530
Hellfire Henry Kent.

257
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,364
Someone wants to pop him.

258
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:13,367
No surprise, with what the
shithead's been saying.

259
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:15,528
Do everyone a favor.

260
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:18,539
As you know, we're
non-political these days.

261
00:23:20,144 --> 00:23:24,547
l'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
l'll have an answer in a few days.

262
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:25,704
Thanks.

263
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:30,214
Why am l getting all this cooperation?

264
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:31,814
Are you kidding?

265
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:34,890
She's a big star.
lmportant people care about her.

266
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:39,492
Politics and showbiz, it's
the same thing these days.

267
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,560
Thanks.

268
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:48,397
There she is.

269
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:50,563
Can l have your autograph?

270
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:52,837
Sure you can.

271
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,342
We're big fans. Can we get a photo?

272
00:23:55,512 --> 00:24:00,415
She'll be thrilled. You're her favorite
actress. We've seen all your movies.

273
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:01,915
Take a good one.

274
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:07,012
Thank you so much.

275
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:08,920
She'll appreciate it.

276
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,526
l'm surprised you didn't plug them.

277
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:35,777
Help me with this stuff.
You sign ''much love, Rachel''...

278
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:38,283
...you sign, ''peace and love, Rachel.''

279
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:41,117
Let me set you straight on a few things.

280
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,960
For starters, l love this lady.

281
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:49,463
What l do for her, l do out of love.

282
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:54,301
l'm not some hired fucking gun who's
here to make her life miserable.

283
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:56,401
l do things the way she likes.

284
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:59,235
Her happiness is everything to me.

285
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,473
No problem. l'd like to
know how you handle things.

286
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:05,476
l handle things fine.

287
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,913
Watch me and learn.

288
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,283
Turn right.

289
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:12,580
ls that him?

290
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:13,814
What's going on?

291
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:15,589
Short cut.

292
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:17,583
Want me to do a 180?

293
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,818
Slow down.

294
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:32,831
Go up to the house!

295
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:45,338
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up!

296
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,843
He's through messing with my life.

297
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,353
l'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.

298
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,586
Farmer, come in here.

299
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,193
-He's nuts!
-Guess who couldn't get in yesterday?

300
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:06,100
Robin Leach.

301
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:11,037
That's funny?! He speaks to 20 million
people and he can't get in here!

302
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,368
He had an appointment?

303
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,374
What about brunch at Charlie's?

304
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:16,877
Rachel goes there every Sunday.

305
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:19,709
She's not to do things
she's always done.

306
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:23,114
''Not to do things she's always done.''
He's a fanatic!

307
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:25,278
So're the guys he's protecting you from.

308
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:27,116
Excuse me if l don't faint.

309
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,952
Then think about your son.

310
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:35,797
What do you want?

311
00:27:35,966 --> 00:27:37,558
l want some peace around here!

312
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:38,894
That's right.

313
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:42,738
We're almost done.

314
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,575
And l want to be able to
eat brunch with my friends.

315
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,074
So go on Tuesdays.

316
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:52,915
Tuesday morning brunch.
Where'd you get him?

317
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:02,756
Louise, you have great stuff.

318
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,587
Take it all.

319
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,919
Try this on.

320
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:09,663
Hey, Farmer...

321
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,998
...want to come in with me?

322
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:14,099
Just to be safe?

323
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,847
You won't believe this...

324
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:30,685
...but l have a reputation
for being a bitch.

325
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,783
l didn't use to be.

326
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:42,021
But you get known for being a certain
way, a way people think you are...

327
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,632
...and pretty soon, you get like that.

328
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:48,032
Guess you can't help it.

329
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,043
You don't think so?

330
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,140
You're an expert on famous people.

331
00:28:58,315 --> 00:28:59,646
l've seen a few.

332
00:28:59,816 --> 00:29:01,215
And you disagree?

333
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:04,645
You can be as you choose to be.

334
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:07,718
lt's an act of discipline,
but it can be done.

335
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:13,395
ls that why you never stay with your
clients? They too undisciplined for you?

336
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:16,488
Or maybe you start caring about them?

337
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:17,563
Right.

338
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:19,901
Can't you answer straight once?

339
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,234
You're too clever for me.
l can't keep up.

340
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,399
Look at me, Farmer!

341
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,847
You don't approve of me.

342
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,080
Disapproval's a luxury l can't afford.

343
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:42,851
lt gets in the way? Don't like
your emotions getting to you?

344
00:29:43,026 --> 00:29:45,085
Never mix business with pleasure?

345
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:47,355
That's right.

346
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:51,026
Will you grab that red jacket?

347
00:29:52,869 --> 00:29:55,702
l'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

348
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:01,107
Thanks.

349
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,555
-Two minutes.
-Three.

350
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,562
Wait. l want to make it really full.

351
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,956
Put it straight up.

352
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,950
Right there.

353
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,287
You must hold it still.

354
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:29,796
What're we looking for?

355
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,459
Bomb.

356
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:36,369
Don't worry, l already checked.

357
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,870
Put it back here a little deeper.

358
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:40,134
Hold it.

359
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,541
Okay, now turn it. Good.
There, right there.

360
00:31:44,314 --> 00:31:46,305
Pull up there for a second.

361
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:48,382
Son-of-a...

362
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,548
l thought it was dinner.

363
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,550
Are we going somewhere else?

364
00:31:58,728 --> 00:31:59,820
The Mayan.

365
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:01,494
What's that?

366
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:03,326
lt's a club. Let's go.

367
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,559
You must tell me about these things.

368
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:07,168
l just did.

369
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,563
Nice suit, Frank.

370
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,673
l want you to keep this.

371
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:19,673
lt's beautiful.

372
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:22,743
lt's fitted with a radio transmitter.

373
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,253
The clasp sends a signal.
lf there's ever a problem, press it.

374
00:32:27,424 --> 00:32:28,914
l'll know you need me.

375
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:31,026
She knows how it works.

376
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:32,525
Let's go.

377
00:32:39,102 --> 00:32:40,694
Come on, let's go.

378
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:45,930
Look!

379
00:32:47,377 --> 00:32:50,710
Look at this great show.
They don't forget.

380
00:32:57,454 --> 00:32:59,945
Get inside. The show's inside.

381
00:33:00,223 --> 00:33:02,282
Henry, just keep driving.

382
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:22,236
How're you doing?

383
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,485
He's from Paris, an amazing director.

384
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:41,654
A performance artist. This is
his first video. Rachel loves it.

385
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,662
This is Sy's idea.

386
00:33:44,834 --> 00:33:47,826
-l thought she'd talk to you.
-You said l had an exclusive.

387
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:51,098
Maybe later. What can l say?
Laurie! How are you?

388
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:54,105
You know Paul. l'll speak to you later.

389
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:57,678
She doesn't do these places.
He thinks it'll help the video.

390
00:34:11,628 --> 00:34:13,619
He sent another one.

391
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:17,356
What do you mean, another one?

392
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:22,637
What do you mean?

393
00:34:22,806 --> 00:34:25,138
-They didn't tell you.
-Tell me what?

394
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:29,303
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threat.

395
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:32,304
We didn't want to worry you.

396
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:34,541
And somebody got into the house.

397
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:36,151
ln my house?

398
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,310
-Let's not get hysterical.
-We should go.

399
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:41,048
While Fletcher was there?!

400
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:42,987
The house is like Fort Knox.

401
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,717
-Right?
-We should go.

402
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:46,225
No one could...

403
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:48,327
-Could what?!
-Calm down.

404
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:49,897
Everyone calm down.

405
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,727
Let's just see how she is.

406
00:34:52,502 --> 00:34:53,491
How are you?

407
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,080
''Watch the door'' means
no candy, no flowers.

408
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,917
ls he out there?

409
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:11,684
He's here, isn't he?

410
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:12,717
Maybe.

411
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,684
We don't know that.

412
00:35:14,858 --> 00:35:16,587
You know he was in my house!

413
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,695
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.

414
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:21,922
Fine, fine. Bill, you make it!

415
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:23,087
Tell them!

416
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:25,530
They'll tear the place apart!

417
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:33,931
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:36,444
...l'm sorry but...

419
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:39,605
...due to circumstances
beyond our control...

420
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:45,049
Wait!

421
00:35:45,221 --> 00:35:47,553
Don't do it. lt's not worth it.

422
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:50,454
No fucking freak will run me off stage.

423
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:54,963
Give it up front.

424
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:56,964
Let's go. We're on.

425
00:35:58,134 --> 00:35:59,465
We're not coming.

426
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,734
l'm afraid Rachel will not
be able to appear tonight.

427
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,146
Just a minute. Give me a chance.

428
00:36:22,826 --> 00:36:25,090
Bill Devaney, everybody!

429
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:28,753
Hello!

430
00:36:31,935 --> 00:36:35,166
Just wanted to stop by
and maybe sing a song.

431
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:38,163
l hope you don't mind.

432
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:42,603
All right. Thank you so much!

433
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:46,271
lsn't Billy Thomas the greatest?
Let's give him a hand.

434
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,610
Go for it, Rachel.

435
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:51,843
Want to see my new video?

436
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:30,151
Are we having a communication problem?

437
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:31,826
What?

438
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:34,054
Are we having a communication problem?

439
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:37,496
Keep this aisle clear.

440
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,498
l know what you're saying.

441
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:43,833
You've got a job to do. But you
must understand Rachel does too.

442
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:46,398
And that's what she's doing.

443
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:47,907
Out there.

444
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:50,511
Look, she's so hot now.

445
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,513
lf she doesn't get out there...

446
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,739
...she's dead.

447
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:58,582
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...

448
00:37:58,755 --> 00:38:00,518
...she's dead anyway.

449
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:09,192
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.

450
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:10,058
No.

451
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:14,362
-lt could clinch the nomination.
-One word in print about this...

452
00:39:34,817 --> 00:39:36,148
Out of the way!

453
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:45,119
l'll get it.

454
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:47,689
Follow me!

455
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,300
-Let us through!
-Fuck you!

456
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:59,207
Where's the fucking limo?

457
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:15,217
Henry! lt's me, Sy!

458
00:40:16,225 --> 00:40:18,659
Stop it! Fuck!

459
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,065
Keep driving.

460
00:40:48,925 --> 00:40:50,517
Never done that before.

461
00:40:53,262 --> 00:40:54,957
lt's been a long night.

462
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:46,681
Don't you want to know
why l behave that way?

463
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:49,006
l know why.

464
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:57,506
l don't want to talk about this again.

465
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,478
Got you, didn't l?

466
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:37,245
Bet you wonder what l'm doing.

467
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:44,649
You didn't know l jog?

468
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:48,196
Afraid l might get picked
off in my running suit?

469
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:51,864
No. l'm afraid that l'm going
to have to jog with you.

470
00:44:56,272 --> 00:44:57,933
Will you walk with me?

471
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:05,206
l know this is kind of late...

472
00:45:05,681 --> 00:45:07,114
...but thank you.

473
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,583
l'm glad you're here.

474
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:13,116
And l'm going to try to cooperate.

475
00:45:14,523 --> 00:45:16,047
That would be good.

476
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:22,891
Farmer, l have this problem.

477
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,897
This minor little problem.

478
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:28,802
l'd like to go out for an evening.

479
00:45:28,971 --> 00:45:31,531
With a guy. Like a date.

480
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:34,965
But...

481
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:37,309
...l can't go out...

482
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,472
...on a date because you must
be with me every minute.

483
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:45,253
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?

484
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,148
So...

485
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:52,252
...the only thing l can figure...

486
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:54,919
...is for you to take me out.

487
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,434
That's what l was wondering.

488
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:02,563
You know?

489
00:46:02,738 --> 00:46:04,103
What do you think?

490
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,267
Only if you want to.

491
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,102
Only if you want to.

492
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,514
God, this is so embarrassing.

493
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:17,112
You decide, okay?

494
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,848
Sandy Harris is on the phone.

495
00:46:20,022 --> 00:46:23,958
Tell her l'll call her back.
l'm getting fixed up.

496
00:47:58,387 --> 00:48:01,117
He didn't look like he wanted to die.

497
00:48:02,124 --> 00:48:04,217
There's a big difference between...

498
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:07,054
...wanting to die and not fearing death.

499
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:13,126
And so because he had no fear
of death, he was invincible?

500
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:15,234
What do you think?

501
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:18,865
He sure creamed them all in the end.

502
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,866
That was a good movie.

503
00:48:23,479 --> 00:48:25,709
How many times have you seen it?

504
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:29,644
62 times.

505
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,083
-l've seen it a lot.
-You can say that!

506
00:48:35,257 --> 00:48:36,656
l've seen it a lot.

507
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:56,168
Your kind of place?

508
00:48:58,113 --> 00:48:59,444
Your kind of music?

509
00:49:00,516 --> 00:49:02,006
Absolutely.

510
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,110
You figure no one can get by you here.

511
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:10,520
lf someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.

512
00:49:12,761 --> 00:49:14,752
What do l need you for?

513
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:17,131
He might get me instead.

514
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:20,528
You're ready to die for me?

515
00:49:21,203 --> 00:49:22,636
That's the job.

516
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:25,139
And you'd do it?

517
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:28,367
Why?

518
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:32,146
l can't sing.

519
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,411
Maybe there is some glory in saving a
president or somebody but...

520
00:49:38,521 --> 00:49:39,647
...just anybody?

521
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:41,215
Like you?

522
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,051
Yeah, like me.

523
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,721
lt's a matter of discipline.

524
00:49:47,563 --> 00:49:49,394
l don't trust discipline.

525
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:52,565
l know at that crucial
moment l'd cop out.

526
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:54,969
lt happens.

527
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:57,866
But not to you, fierce Frank.

528
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,673
lt happens.

529
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:05,406
So have you ever liked anybody?

530
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:08,872
What do you mean?

531
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:12,745
Like me, a girl?

532
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,824
Yeah, a long time ago.

533
00:50:17,092 --> 00:50:18,423
What happened?

534
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:20,092
Do you mind if l ask?

535
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:21,695
You mind if l don't answer?

536
00:50:24,767 --> 00:50:26,257
l don't want to pry.

537
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,596
Oh, yeah, l can see that.

538
00:50:32,207 --> 00:50:33,196
What?

539
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,104
She didn't die, did she?

540
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:41,005
While you were protecting
her she got killed, right?

541
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,787
God! That's not it, is it?

542
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,621
That's it, isn't it?

543
00:50:57,566 --> 00:50:59,295
Nobody's perfect.

544
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,805
l'm sorry, Frank.

545
00:51:07,876 --> 00:51:09,241
l'm sorry.

546
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:17,942
Nice try, though.

547
00:51:24,426 --> 00:51:26,758
lt was less dramatic than that.

548
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,764
She didn't love me anymore.

549
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,593
Can you imagine that?

550
00:51:35,337 --> 00:51:37,328
No, not really.

551
00:51:53,188 --> 00:51:54,280
So...

552
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:57,183
...is this a full-service date?

553
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:05,695
l'm just asking you to dance.

554
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:10,364
Come on.

555
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:14,704
You can dance, can't you?

556
00:52:49,912 --> 00:52:52,403
This is kind of a cowboy song?

557
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:07,256
Nothing. lt's nothing.

558
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:16,761
l mean, it's so depressing.
Have you listened to the words?

559
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:27,177
-lt is kind of depressing.
-Yes, it is.

560
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:32,716
lt's one of those somebody's-
always-leaving-somebody songs.

561
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:44,793
Don't worry.

562
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:47,966
Don't worry.

563
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:49,636
l'll protect you.

564
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,596
lt's very quiet here.

565
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:28,834
You ever going to hang these up?

566
00:54:31,346 --> 00:54:33,439
Maybe when l'm here long enough.

567
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:37,012
West Virginia University Football.

568
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:38,816
God!

569
00:54:39,354 --> 00:54:40,946
Take a look at you.

570
00:54:42,024 --> 00:54:43,252
What'd you play?

571
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:44,685
The end.

572
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,850
Were you tough?

573
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,021
No, l was fast.

574
00:54:59,107 --> 00:55:01,371
So you were in the Secret Service?

575
00:55:01,877 --> 00:55:03,174
What made you get out?

576
00:55:05,981 --> 00:55:07,175
Money.

577
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:12,281
l can see your tastes are extravagant.

578
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,219
May l?

579
00:55:40,482 --> 00:55:41,915
Be careful.

580
00:56:17,686 --> 00:56:20,018
You're a hard one to figure out.

581
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:28,690
A bodyguard must know very little peace.

582
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:51,549
Watch this.

583
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:40,796
l've never felt this safe before.

584
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:45,805
No one could get by you.

585
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:51,571
Right now it might not be too difficult.

586
00:58:28,116 --> 00:58:29,640
What are you doing?

587
00:58:36,291 --> 00:58:39,454
l don't want to get confused
about what l'm doing here.

588
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:42,026
l'm not confused.

589
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:45,194
You pay me to protect you.
That's what l do.

590
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,297
Did l do something wrong?

591
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,129
Nothing.

592
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:55,899
Then what is it?

593
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,571
Do you want me to beg?

594
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:14,862
What's going on, Frank?

595
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:18,760
l want to keep straight what my job is.

596
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:21,994
And what is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?

597
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,498
l'm sorry, it's my fault.

598
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:30,506
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what l did. l'm a big girl.

599
00:59:30,712 --> 00:59:32,236
You didn't do anything.

600
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:34,079
lt was me.

601
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:36,878
l got involved with my client.

602
00:59:37,018 --> 00:59:38,076
Your client?!

603
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,078
l made a mistake.

604
00:59:41,022 --> 00:59:43,718
So you're not attracted
to your client anymore?

605
00:59:43,892 --> 00:59:45,951
Christ, l told you why!

606
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:49,021
l can't protect you like this.

607
00:59:52,734 --> 00:59:54,531
So that's it for me?

608
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:56,899
That's it?

609
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:03,205
l don't believe it!

610
01:00:04,112 --> 01:00:05,909
Accept it, or fire me.

611
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:07,805
But l can't fuck you.

612
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:24,822
She's real mad at you, isn't she?

613
01:00:26,935 --> 01:00:30,564
She said she doesn't know why
you're being so shitty to her.

614
01:00:30,772 --> 01:00:33,240
l don't like you to use that language.

615
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:45,082
l spent a lot of time learning not to
react to things like other people.

616
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:47,245
That's my job.

617
01:00:48,323 --> 01:00:50,018
lt doesn't always work.

618
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,960
lt doesn't always work.

619
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:56,587
l don't think l understand.

620
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,035
l'm an old man compared to you
and l don't understand either.

621
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,031
l'm starting to get the feeling...

622
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:05,864
...that l never will.

623
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,347
l thought you'd like to know.

624
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:19,042
Everyone said she was a sure thing.

625
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:21,879
But you already knew that.

626
01:01:28,363 --> 01:01:32,629
Sorry. lt's completely out of line.
lt was none of my business.

627
01:01:47,148 --> 01:01:50,481
lt's off to Miami today for Best
Actress nominee Rachel Marron.

628
01:01:50,652 --> 01:01:55,146
She'll give two AlDS charity concerts
at the Fontainebleau Hilton.

629
01:01:55,323 --> 01:01:56,847
$1,000 a plate, no less.

630
01:01:57,025 --> 01:02:00,756
And it's a brave man who'd
deny she's worth every cent.

631
01:02:08,203 --> 01:02:11,695
This is Mobile 1 to Station 2.
Zero 2, engineering.

632
01:02:11,906 --> 01:02:15,740
Have them do a 14 reference to
presidential suite balcony.

633
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:22,509
lt's okay. They're cleared.

634
01:02:23,685 --> 01:02:28,054
Mobile 2 to Catering. Security
says to clear kitchen aisle...

635
01:02:28,223 --> 01:02:31,886
...of all obstructions and traffic,
effective immediately.

636
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:34,218
Mobile 2 to front of house.

637
01:02:34,362 --> 01:02:38,594
Security requests updated list of
all ticket holders for concert.

638
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:43,532
Please fax copies of any names which are
added to the list to Security Office.

639
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:48,135
What a silly job this is.

640
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,843
Okay, we're rolling!

641
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,139
-Showtime, everybody!
-ls this necessary?

642
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:56,443
Yes, it is. Let's go.

643
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,914
Quit bitching. You get paid for this.

644
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:03,922
Rachel, can you give us
a couple of minutes?

645
01:03:04,092 --> 01:03:07,721
-How do you like our city?
-l love it! l love Miami!

646
01:04:49,564 --> 01:04:51,429
Did you arrange all this?

647
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:54,364
Hey, that's me!

648
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:08,279
Hello, Frank.

649
01:05:11,753 --> 01:05:13,277
lt's been a long time.

650
01:05:13,588 --> 01:05:14,850
You working?

651
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:19,057
Not technically, but
the Governor may come...

652
01:05:19,227 --> 01:05:21,855
...so l thought l'd give a light check.

653
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:25,065
Someone else is covering him now.

654
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,124
How old's she?

655
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,701
Maybe 18.

656
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:38,770
Thank you.

657
01:05:39,013 --> 01:05:42,244
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.

658
01:05:43,551 --> 01:05:45,883
l want you all to have a good time...

659
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:50,319
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as you possibly can.

660
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,887
Thank you.

661
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:56,428
l'd call that a step
up from the President.

662
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,433
Probably sings better too.

663
01:06:01,302 --> 01:06:02,291
Handful.

664
01:06:05,106 --> 01:06:07,506
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.

665
01:06:11,746 --> 01:06:13,270
Wasn't your fault.

666
01:06:13,915 --> 01:06:15,576
You weren't even there.

667
01:06:21,456 --> 01:06:22,923
l need a drink.

668
01:06:30,832 --> 01:06:32,356
Orange juice.

669
01:06:33,201 --> 01:06:34,463
Who're you?

670
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:35,929
Greg Portman.

671
01:06:37,071 --> 01:06:39,471
l take it you've met my bodyguard.

672
01:06:40,608 --> 01:06:42,473
We used to work together.

673
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:46,306
Well, well, well.

674
01:06:46,848 --> 01:06:48,679
What do you do now?

675
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:50,482
Same thing as Farmer.

676
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:53,545
Two samurai, huh?

677
01:06:56,691 --> 01:06:58,556
So are you working now?

678
01:06:59,694 --> 01:07:01,161
Not right now.

679
01:07:01,696 --> 01:07:02,685
Good.

680
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:06,799
Because l'm the only person in
this room that needs protection.

681
01:07:09,637 --> 01:07:12,333
Let's get a drink. A real one.

682
01:07:29,891 --> 01:07:31,415
Orange juice, sir?

683
01:07:37,832 --> 01:07:41,199
l've been watching you all
night from across the room.

684
01:07:44,272 --> 01:07:46,433
Why don't you go back and watch?

685
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:25,702
No, l'm not doing this.

686
01:08:26,714 --> 01:08:27,703
You are.

687
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:34,178
Please go now.

688
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:35,956
Not right now.

689
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:40,726
Mr. Portman was just leaving.

690
01:08:46,968 --> 01:08:48,492
Good night, Rachel.

691
01:09:05,987 --> 01:09:07,079
Shit.

692
01:10:05,146 --> 01:10:06,670
What are you looking at?

693
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,679
You probably never had a heavy night
in your whole disciplined life.

694
01:10:13,888 --> 01:10:14,980
Coffee?

695
01:10:18,059 --> 01:10:20,755
You're a self-righteous bastard.

696
01:10:22,697 --> 01:10:24,995
Don't laugh! Don't dare judge me!

697
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:28,693
Give me a break. l didn't tell
you to fuck everyone in the hotel!

698
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:31,702
Fuck this. l don't need this shit.

699
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:41,047
lndustrial detergent.
lt matches the traces in the glue.

700
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:44,682
We'll nail this sucker.

701
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:47,050
Don't take too long.

702
01:10:48,823 --> 01:10:50,518
lt's good money, isn't it?

703
01:10:52,527 --> 01:10:53,994
lt's good money.

704
01:11:24,559 --> 01:11:26,857
-Where is she?
-l don't know.

705
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:30,725
-Where's Tony?
-l thought you were with her.

706
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:41,104
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?

707
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,273
The door to the suite! Where is he?

708
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:47,576
Get someone up here, now!

709
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:49,872
He doesn't know.

710
01:11:50,051 --> 01:11:51,416
Where're you going?

711
01:11:58,826 --> 01:12:01,056
Where in the hell have you been?

712
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:04,664
l went to Bal Harbor to shop.

713
01:12:04,832 --> 01:12:06,299
You want these in the bedroom?

714
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,661
Leave them so l can look at them.

715
01:12:08,836 --> 01:12:11,964
You had us worried. You know
you're not supposed to do that.

716
01:12:12,773 --> 01:12:15,241
l'll do what l want when l want.

717
01:12:16,077 --> 01:12:17,442
Besides...

718
01:12:18,446 --> 01:12:20,778
...l'm tired of hanging
around deadbeats.

719
01:12:21,515 --> 01:12:22,675
No offense Tony.

720
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,787
Once more and l'm gone.

721
01:12:30,992 --> 01:12:34,519
You remember something.
You work here. You work for me!

722
01:12:35,162 --> 01:12:36,527
Where're you going?

723
01:12:36,697 --> 01:12:38,790
To check the route, as usual.

724
01:12:42,436 --> 01:12:43,494
Did Fletcher call?

725
01:13:08,195 --> 01:13:09,560
Gomez!

726
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:24,842
What are you doing?

727
01:13:24,979 --> 01:13:26,970
None of your fucking business.

728
01:13:28,182 --> 01:13:29,012
Move!

729
01:13:30,685 --> 01:13:32,516
Stick it up your ass!

730
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:51,337
Stop! Don't hurt my husband, mister!

731
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:54,997
Please, don't hurt my husband.
He not up to nothing.

732
01:14:07,555 --> 01:14:08,886
l'm sorry.

733
01:14:25,106 --> 01:14:26,095
Hello.

734
01:14:26,273 --> 01:14:27,365
Mommy?

735
01:14:28,442 --> 01:14:30,433
Fletcher, is that you?

736
01:14:38,919 --> 01:14:39,908
Listen.

737
01:14:40,654 --> 01:14:42,121
l'm through, Bill.

738
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:45,281
l'm through. l'll get you
back to L.A. and that's it.

739
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:47,586
Fletcher's guard'll cover you.

740
01:14:47,828 --> 01:14:49,921
She got another call.

741
01:14:50,398 --> 01:14:52,457
-l don't care.
-lt was him. Same guy.

742
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:53,655
l don't care!

743
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:58,294
lt really shook her up. She thought
it was Fletcher calling from L.A.

744
01:14:58,472 --> 01:15:01,236
l know she'll be reasonable now.
Come on.

745
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:03,001
Save it, Devaney!

746
01:15:03,144 --> 01:15:07,137
Those who hire me don't have to be
convinced to save their own lives!

747
01:15:11,318 --> 01:15:13,081
Call me when she's ready.

748
01:15:52,726 --> 01:15:55,661
Nothing that's happened
between us matters.

749
01:15:59,066 --> 01:16:00,829
l understand now.

750
01:16:03,304 --> 01:16:06,671
You must believe me because
l'm not going to beg.

751
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,075
lt wasn't what he said...

752
01:16:12,213 --> 01:16:14,078
...it was the way he said it.

753
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:19,542
Frank, l need you. l'm afraid.

754
01:16:21,322 --> 01:16:23,153
And l hate my fear.

755
01:16:25,759 --> 01:16:28,227
Please protect me. Protect Fletcher.

756
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:30,760
lf anything happened to him....

757
01:16:31,332 --> 01:16:32,697
l can't.

758
01:16:33,868 --> 01:16:35,028
l can't.

759
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:37,770
l can't protect you like this.

760
01:16:39,507 --> 01:16:42,408
lt's impossible.
The odds are all on his side.

761
01:16:44,345 --> 01:16:46,779
l will do whatever you say.

762
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:58,516
l'd want to take you away from here.

763
01:16:59,793 --> 01:17:01,260
l can do that.

764
01:17:07,201 --> 01:17:09,897
lt'd mean cancelling your concerts.

765
01:17:13,908 --> 01:17:14,966
All right.

766
01:17:16,277 --> 01:17:17,904
No more Sy.

767
01:17:21,448 --> 01:17:23,746
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.

768
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:28,380
Okay.

769
01:17:29,823 --> 01:17:33,281
You cross me up this time, l
swear l'll kill you myself.

770
01:18:33,821 --> 01:18:35,049
Lake's low.

771
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:38,481
lt'll rise when it thaws.

772
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:48,261
They all in trouble?

773
01:18:51,372 --> 01:18:52,634
Just one.

774
01:18:59,346 --> 01:19:01,337
He likes you.

775
01:19:01,782 --> 01:19:03,773
So is that going to protect us?

776
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:07,184
He's a trained noisemaker.

777
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:08,854
Come here, Foster.

778
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:10,588
Just what we need.

779
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:14,784
l don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.

780
01:19:14,928 --> 01:19:16,418
And this one does?

781
01:19:17,097 --> 01:19:19,031
Yeah, this one does.

782
01:19:31,378 --> 01:19:32,709
Excuse me.

783
01:19:33,447 --> 01:19:36,814
Katherine had this place
organized the way she wanted it.

784
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:39,210
That's Frank's mama.

785
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:49,728
Fletcher can't swim very well.

786
01:19:49,963 --> 01:19:52,227
He better stay in the boat then.

787
01:20:06,847 --> 01:20:08,246
Frank says you're a singer.

788
01:20:08,582 --> 01:20:09,981
That's right.

789
01:20:12,252 --> 01:20:15,483
We're kind of out of things up here.
l'm sorry.

790
01:20:15,656 --> 01:20:16,987
That's okay.

791
01:20:18,926 --> 01:20:22,157
You must be very successful if
you need someone like Frank.

792
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:27,261
lt's quiet here.

793
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:31,501
Frank spent 6 months here
after that Reagan thing.

794
01:20:32,606 --> 01:20:33,868
Reagan thing?

795
01:20:35,008 --> 01:20:38,444
Frank was gone when Reagan was shot.
He never got over it.

796
01:20:44,785 --> 01:20:47,117
That's the day we buried Katherine.

797
01:20:51,392 --> 01:20:52,882
He's a rascal now.

798
01:20:53,026 --> 01:20:54,015
Tell us.

799
01:20:54,962 --> 01:20:56,122
l never hit him.

800
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:57,695
-Ever.
-You should have.

801
01:20:57,898 --> 01:21:00,196
That's unusual for my people.

802
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:03,398
So what happens is, he's
about 10 years old...

803
01:21:03,537 --> 01:21:06,028
...and he starts complaining to me.

804
01:21:06,407 --> 01:21:07,465
How about that.

805
01:21:07,808 --> 01:21:11,039
Dad, l'll tell them about the
time you stripped in court.

806
01:21:11,211 --> 01:21:13,145
l want to hear this.

807
01:21:14,915 --> 01:21:16,473
l'm proud of that!

808
01:21:17,484 --> 01:21:20,476
So, anyway, he starts
playing tackle football...

809
01:21:20,654 --> 01:21:25,421
...when he's 10 and one day he comes to
me and says he's afraid of being hit.

810
01:21:25,826 --> 01:21:29,922
Says it's my fault. ''How come
you never hit me?'' he says to me.

811
01:21:30,164 --> 01:21:32,724
How about that? He got over it.

812
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:36,168
Turned into one hell of a wide receiver.

813
01:21:36,737 --> 01:21:40,833
He was always like that, my son.
Couldn't stand being afraid.

814
01:21:41,008 --> 01:21:45,672
Something scared him, he'd just keep
doing it until the fear went away.

815
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,514
His mama was the same way.

816
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:51,516
You have a beautiful family.

817
01:21:51,752 --> 01:21:54,516
-You had enough to eat?
-Fletcher, wipe your mouth.

818
01:21:55,355 --> 01:21:57,516
-Save some for dessert.
-You through, bucket mouth?

819
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:02,025
l won't tell about when you
were 13 and discovered girls.

820
01:22:07,768 --> 01:22:08,860
Come on.

821
01:22:09,203 --> 01:22:11,194
You can run but you can't hide.

822
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:18,110
l'm black, right?

823
01:22:18,278 --> 01:22:20,769
You know you're white. Your move!

824
01:22:20,981 --> 01:22:22,972
My move? You're sure?

825
01:22:23,116 --> 01:22:25,778
The last move, l took your rook.

826
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:33,285
That's right.

827
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,627
How long has this been going on?

828
01:22:44,571 --> 01:22:45,560
3 years.

829
01:22:47,007 --> 01:22:49,498
First year he had me on the run.

830
01:22:53,814 --> 01:22:55,406
What do you think?

831
01:22:56,917 --> 01:22:58,316
Knight to king-four.

832
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:00,411
City kid.

833
01:23:17,838 --> 01:23:20,170
Son, you come here and sit with me.

834
01:23:25,612 --> 01:23:28,342
Well, that's it for me, guys.
l'm going to bed.

835
01:23:28,615 --> 01:23:30,446
You're in trouble.

836
01:23:42,563 --> 01:23:45,054
Foster, right here. Turn around.

837
01:24:01,715 --> 01:24:03,148
Good night, Rachel.

838
01:24:04,217 --> 01:24:05,980
Good night, Frank.

839
01:24:06,153 --> 01:24:08,713
Good night, Foster. Good night.

840
01:24:11,091 --> 01:24:12,991
lt's good to hear you laugh.

841
01:24:18,332 --> 01:24:19,390
Stay.

842
01:24:41,121 --> 01:24:42,918
You're very thorough.

843
01:24:50,864 --> 01:24:53,025
What's happening with you and Rachel?

844
01:24:55,202 --> 01:24:58,535
One minute she has magnetic
hands and the next she hates you.

845
01:24:58,705 --> 01:25:01,037
l don't know what's going on now.

846
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:03,707
You follow all her moves this closely?

847
01:25:06,546 --> 01:25:08,138
lt's a living.

848
01:25:09,149 --> 01:25:10,548
No, it's not.

849
01:25:17,724 --> 01:25:20,386
You must think my life's pretty sick.

850
01:25:22,462 --> 01:25:24,794
You must. l do.

851
01:25:26,066 --> 01:25:28,296
Then why don't you change it?

852
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:34,800
ls it that easy?

853
01:25:49,089 --> 01:25:50,750
You're a lovely woman.

854
01:25:51,491 --> 01:25:53,186
But you don't want me?

855
01:25:57,097 --> 01:25:59,827
l'm surprised. Thorough fellow like you.

856
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,696
Why stop at one sister when
you can fuck them both?

857
01:26:04,705 --> 01:26:06,696
l make my mistakes.

858
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:09,334
But you didn't say no to the boss.

859
01:26:22,456 --> 01:26:23,855
ls this elk?

860
01:26:28,795 --> 01:26:30,228
A dear?

861
01:26:30,964 --> 01:26:32,295
Big.

862
01:26:41,808 --> 01:26:44,868
First time l've heard church
music in the middle of the week.

863
01:26:57,324 --> 01:27:01,988
Jesus loves me, oh, yes, he does.

864
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:10,997
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

865
01:27:16,076 --> 01:27:20,775
Jesus loves us, oh, yes, he does.

866
01:27:25,352 --> 01:27:27,183
For the Bible...

867
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:31,413
...tells me so.

868
01:27:34,928 --> 01:27:37,021
-Hi, kiddo.
-Hi, honey.

869
01:27:54,848 --> 01:27:56,145
Where's Fletcher?

870
01:28:28,081 --> 01:28:29,446
Help!

871
01:28:29,616 --> 01:28:30,810
He can't swim!

872
01:28:40,894 --> 01:28:42,191
Help!

873
01:28:43,463 --> 01:28:44,794
Help!

874
01:28:46,099 --> 01:28:47,726
Let me have him!

875
01:28:59,646 --> 01:29:01,204
What were you doing?

876
01:29:02,282 --> 01:29:03,977
You're crazy!

877
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:05,277
You are out of your mind!

878
01:29:05,986 --> 01:29:09,285
You could have drowned him!
You could have drowned him!

879
01:29:09,656 --> 01:29:10,987
l'm sorry.

880
01:29:12,592 --> 01:29:13,923
l got careless.

881
01:29:17,297 --> 01:29:19,288
How will we get the boat back?

882
01:29:29,142 --> 01:29:31,133
Put them in there.

883
01:29:41,087 --> 01:29:45,319
Someone's cut the phone lines. Could
be anywhere between here and town.

884
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:48,321
Both cars are dead. l don't see how.

885
01:29:50,463 --> 01:29:52,158
Who knows you're here?

886
01:29:52,799 --> 01:29:55,461
l don't know. This place
has nothing to do with her.

887
01:29:56,036 --> 01:29:58,163
Maybe it has to do with you.

888
01:30:00,273 --> 01:30:02,798
And we can't walk out of here at night.

889
01:30:02,976 --> 01:30:04,034
l know.

890
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:07,439
We'll stay and walk out at first light.

891
01:31:26,059 --> 01:31:28,118
l was an idiot last night.

892
01:31:33,633 --> 01:31:36,124
What'd you think about today?

893
01:31:43,443 --> 01:31:45,570
l think this is no maniac.

894
01:31:47,380 --> 01:31:48,904
He knows what he's doing.

895
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,445
You're right. He does.

896
01:31:56,156 --> 01:31:57,589
Tell me about it.

897
01:31:58,925 --> 01:32:01,155
-Who is it?
-He almost got Fletcher...

898
01:32:01,294 --> 01:32:02,659
How do we stop him?

899
01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:05,389
-He almost got the baby!
-Who is it?

900
01:32:05,598 --> 01:32:07,088
l don't know.

901
01:32:07,233 --> 01:32:08,393
Call it off.

902
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:11,399
He doesn't even know who hired him.

903
01:32:13,006 --> 01:32:16,100
l don't know who he is and
he doesn't know who l am.

904
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:18,773
How did you do it?

905
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:20,839
How?

906
01:32:21,014 --> 01:32:23,312
l went to a bar in East L.A.

907
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:28,243
l asked around. And there was this guy.

908
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:29,410
Name?

909
01:32:29,689 --> 01:32:31,418
-Armando.
-Give me his name!

910
01:32:32,258 --> 01:32:33,486
Armando.

911
01:32:38,698 --> 01:32:41,132
He arranged it, that's all l know.

912
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:43,430
lt's all paid?

913
01:32:47,273 --> 01:32:48,433
ls it paid for?

914
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:51,508
And then some, okay? Till it's done.

915
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,212
He keeps going until he kills her?

916
01:32:59,986 --> 01:33:03,444
-What's the name of the bar?
-l'm not sure.

917
01:33:03,723 --> 01:33:04,815
l was stoned.

918
01:33:07,894 --> 01:33:10,829
All right. How about the letters?

919
01:33:11,364 --> 01:33:15,164
The letters came first. l don't
know who's writing the letters.

920
01:33:15,368 --> 01:33:18,064
Shit, but they're reading my mind.

921
01:33:18,371 --> 01:33:21,534
Those are my thoughts. l hate her.

922
01:33:25,245 --> 01:33:27,543
lt made me think l could do it.

923
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:32,674
But l would never hurt the baby.
l would never hurt Fletcher!

924
01:33:32,852 --> 01:33:33,841
l know.

925
01:33:36,189 --> 01:33:38,020
You must stop it.

926
01:33:38,191 --> 01:33:39,180
We will.

927
01:33:39,559 --> 01:33:41,026
You and me.

928
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:52,029
Don't you want to know why?

929
01:33:52,705 --> 01:33:54,036
You told me.

930
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,368
She has everything.

931
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:03,272
What if we can't find him?

932
01:34:09,422 --> 01:34:11,515
Stay here and don't move.

933
01:34:28,074 --> 01:34:29,598
-lt's me!
-God!

934
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:31,743
What's happening?

935
01:34:32,378 --> 01:34:33,367
Stay with her!

936
01:34:33,613 --> 01:34:36,980
-Where's Nicki?
-No! No, stop! l'm the one--

937
01:34:53,466 --> 01:34:55,400
-Dad?
-We're okay.

938
01:36:13,913 --> 01:36:16,245
-Doesn't make sense.
-What do you mean?

939
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:17,474
We got him.

940
01:36:17,717 --> 01:36:19,708
What do you mean? Where?

941
01:36:19,919 --> 01:36:23,411
Here. Last night. ln L.A.
You should see this guy's locker.

942
01:36:23,556 --> 01:36:25,251
He's obsessed with her.

943
01:36:25,425 --> 01:36:26,722
You sure it's him?

944
01:36:26,926 --> 01:36:29,258
Forensics say a 100% positive lD.

945
01:36:29,662 --> 01:36:31,857
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.

946
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:33,555
We know you did it.

947
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,667
Ray's with him now.

948
01:36:36,736 --> 01:36:41,264
lt's you that sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.

949
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:42,499
We know!

950
01:36:43,509 --> 01:36:44,737
We know it!

951
01:36:44,944 --> 01:36:49,574
Whoever you got down there wasn't here
last night. This was a professional.

952
01:36:50,216 --> 01:36:51,513
This is crazy.

953
01:36:51,684 --> 01:36:53,276
What do you want to do?

954
01:36:55,455 --> 01:36:56,683
How long can you keep him?

955
01:36:57,390 --> 01:36:59,756
All he's done is write some letters.

956
01:37:00,126 --> 01:37:02,890
48 hours maximum. You know the deal.

957
01:37:04,697 --> 01:37:05,891
l know.

958
01:37:12,171 --> 01:37:16,631
Strict security surrounded the funeral
of music executive Nicki Marron...

959
01:37:17,443 --> 01:37:21,436
...who was shot at a lakeside
retreat by an unknown intruder.

960
01:37:21,581 --> 01:37:24,573
Nicki was the eldest
sister of Rachel Marron.

961
01:37:24,751 --> 01:37:29,120
A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated
actress said she was devastated...

962
01:37:29,288 --> 01:37:33,588
...and added that naturally it cast a
pall over the upcoming award ceremony.

963
01:38:49,202 --> 01:38:50,362
You okay?

964
01:38:52,038 --> 01:38:55,667
Yeah, Fletcher, l'm okay.
How about yourself?

965
01:38:57,443 --> 01:38:59,274
l couldn't sleep.

966
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:04,213
lt was so scary, just thinking about it.

967
01:39:06,285 --> 01:39:08,276
Are you scared?

968
01:39:09,155 --> 01:39:11,146
Everybody's afraid of something.

969
01:39:13,292 --> 01:39:16,056
That's how we know we
care about things...

970
01:39:17,063 --> 01:39:18,690
...when we're scared to lose them.

971
01:39:20,766 --> 01:39:22,233
What are you afraid of?

972
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:27,704
l think you should try
to go back to sleep.

973
01:39:30,776 --> 01:39:33,244
ls it the man who killed Nicki?

974
01:39:35,414 --> 01:39:37,314
Are you afraid of him?

975
01:39:40,486 --> 01:39:41,783
Then what?

976
01:39:43,256 --> 01:39:45,190
What are you afraid of?

977
01:39:52,098 --> 01:39:53,793
l'm afraid of not...

978
01:39:55,434 --> 01:39:56,731
...being there.

979
01:40:03,276 --> 01:40:06,268
lt's late. Want me to
take you up to your room?

980
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:03,034
May l sit down?

981
01:41:16,682 --> 01:41:18,411
lt isn't over yet, is it?

982
01:41:22,054 --> 01:41:23,578
So he'll come again?

983
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:26,289
lt's possible.

984
01:41:27,693 --> 01:41:28,717
At the Oscars?

985
01:41:30,596 --> 01:41:31,756
Maybe.

986
01:41:36,369 --> 01:41:38,064
Back in Squirrel Hill...

987
01:41:39,372 --> 01:41:44,207
...l started betting my friends 50 bucks
each that someday l'd win an Oscar.

988
01:41:46,078 --> 01:41:49,912
So it's very important for them
to see me up there if l win.

989
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:55,850
lf every one of those pikers comes
through, it'd add up to a lot of money.

990
01:42:01,727 --> 01:42:03,456
l don't know, Rachel.

991
01:42:03,796 --> 01:42:05,787
l think it's still dangerous.

992
01:42:05,931 --> 01:42:09,458
l didn't get here by doing
the smart thing every time.

993
01:42:13,239 --> 01:42:14,399
How about you?

994
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:19,236
Out there on the edge.

995
01:42:19,412 --> 01:42:22,745
Haven't you done something
that didn't make sense...

996
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:27,475
...except inside you? ln your stomach?

997
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:32,957
l know you have.

998
01:42:33,592 --> 01:42:36,060
Because no one gets good without it.

999
01:42:36,829 --> 01:42:38,262
And l know you're good.

1000
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,128
Look...

1001
01:42:46,138 --> 01:42:48,663
...l don't know why this is happening...

1002
01:42:50,609 --> 01:42:52,975
...but l know it's not your fault.

1003
01:42:53,512 --> 01:42:57,505
And l hope you can hear me because
this is the way l say l'm sorry.

1004
01:42:59,285 --> 01:43:00,445
So...

1005
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,080
...l'm going to the
Oscars and see if l win.

1006
01:43:05,091 --> 01:43:08,083
And l won't worry about
it at all, because...

1007
01:43:08,861 --> 01:43:10,852
...l have you to protect me.

1008
01:43:12,798 --> 01:43:14,095
That's right.

1009
01:43:19,004 --> 01:43:20,301
That's right.

1010
01:44:04,517 --> 01:44:07,975
We'll go straight back to the Green Room.
Got that, Tony?

1011
01:44:08,354 --> 01:44:09,844
Tony knows what he's doing.

1012
01:44:10,689 --> 01:44:14,853
l wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.

1013
01:44:15,361 --> 01:44:16,453
Right?

1014
01:44:17,363 --> 01:44:19,160
Unless l lose the award.

1015
01:44:22,535 --> 01:44:23,934
Jesus, what a crew!

1016
01:44:27,473 --> 01:44:28,770
Screw it.

1017
01:44:29,008 --> 01:44:30,942
l'm tired of worrying.

1018
01:44:31,243 --> 01:44:32,870
When your time is up...

1019
01:44:33,946 --> 01:44:35,072
...it's up.

1020
01:44:36,182 --> 01:44:37,547
Right, Frank?

1021
01:45:01,574 --> 01:45:04,042
-Rachel Marron, how are you?
-Fine. And you?

1022
01:45:04,210 --> 01:45:05,575
Good. You look lovely.

1023
01:45:05,744 --> 01:45:07,803
-Thank you.
-And they love you, don't they?

1024
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,208
They're going wild!

1025
01:45:09,415 --> 01:45:11,906
So are you the queen of this night?

1026
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:13,279
Let's hope so.

1027
01:45:14,220 --> 01:45:18,213
Good luck. Everybody's pulling for you.
Rachel Marron, everybody.

1028
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:28,230
And the award for best
achievement in sound...

1029
01:45:28,934 --> 01:45:30,424
...goes to...

1030
01:45:30,603 --> 01:45:32,230
...Kay Colvin...

1031
01:45:32,438 --> 01:45:35,430
...and Mychal Smith for ''Hot and Cold.''

1032
01:45:56,695 --> 01:45:58,560
Thank you so much.

1033
01:45:58,964 --> 01:46:01,159
l want to thank our producers.

1034
01:46:04,169 --> 01:46:07,866
There is a gap, house left, rows EE FF.
Get me some fillers.

1035
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:14,042
You look beautiful. l just need to
tell you your responsibilities.

1036
01:46:16,181 --> 01:46:18,877
Now it's Best Sound.
Then a song, then you.

1037
01:46:19,051 --> 01:46:22,350
At 8:07, you will be
presenting with Clive Healy.

1038
01:46:23,055 --> 01:46:24,488
Your lines.

1039
01:46:24,723 --> 01:46:28,056
The TelePrompTer is straight ahead
and, we pray, working perfectly.

1040
01:46:30,729 --> 01:46:34,495
l understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.

1041
01:46:34,733 --> 01:46:38,897
That's right and l don't like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.

1042
01:46:39,071 --> 01:46:40,299
l wish.

1043
01:46:40,839 --> 01:46:43,307
How's the Hollywood cricket scene?

1044
01:46:43,509 --> 01:46:48,378
Coming out of commercial. Five,
four, three, two. Cue music.

1045
01:46:49,682 --> 01:46:51,149
Cue Robert.

1046
01:46:54,019 --> 01:46:56,078
Welcome back to the Academy Awards.

1047
01:46:56,221 --> 01:46:57,688
Stand by, dancers.

1048
01:46:57,856 --> 01:47:01,223
l just heard that in New York
the economy is so bad...

1049
01:47:01,393 --> 01:47:04,521
...that the Mafia has
laid off five judges.

1050
01:47:07,399 --> 01:47:10,527
l'm going to look around,
then come back for her.

1051
01:47:12,171 --> 01:47:13,866
No more carrots.

1052
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,638
Did you like the couple that just won?

1053
01:47:16,775 --> 01:47:19,710
Did you ever see a woman on
sound that looked like that?

1054
01:47:20,112 --> 01:47:22,171
She must have been the boom girl.

1055
01:47:22,948 --> 01:47:25,712
Looked like the bada-bing-bada-boom
girl right there.

1056
01:47:25,884 --> 01:47:28,250
lf she's working sound, who's listening?

1057
01:47:28,554 --> 01:47:29,782
Lighting change.

1058
01:47:29,955 --> 01:47:33,550
And he was eloquent: ''lt's the
most happiest day of my life.''

1059
01:47:33,726 --> 01:47:37,355
Bet his mother was very
most proudest of him then.

1060
01:47:37,563 --> 01:47:38,723
20 seconds.

1061
01:47:42,201 --> 01:47:43,896
Hi, Frank. How are you?

1062
01:47:44,269 --> 01:47:45,361
Why're you here?

1063
01:47:45,971 --> 01:47:47,905
-On the job.
-Who?

1064
01:47:49,742 --> 01:47:50,731
Him.

1065
01:47:51,377 --> 01:47:52,810
Short-term gig, but...

1066
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:54,907
...profitable.

1067
01:47:57,816 --> 01:48:00,284
Frank, l'm sorry about Miami.

1068
01:48:02,454 --> 01:48:04,217
Cue music.

1069
01:48:05,624 --> 01:48:07,114
Cue dancers.

1070
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:16,698
Back to work.

1071
01:48:17,169 --> 01:48:19,262
See you at the Governor's ball.

01:48:38,590 --> 01:48:39,989
Tony, you there?

1076
01:48:41,693 --> 01:48:42,751
Tony?

1077
01:48:43,695 --> 01:48:48,155

He'll go for her on camera.

01:48:48,434 --> 01:48:49,594
That's crazy!

1079
01:48:49,768 --> 01:48:53,704
That's how he wants it to look;
but he's not crazy, he's very clever.

1080
01:48:53,872 --> 01:48:56,432
Listen, l need you to help me tonight.

1081
01:48:56,608 --> 01:49:00,009
You can't use that thing.
There's bad breakthrough.

1082
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:01,874
l must disconnect you.

1083
01:49:03,015 --> 01:49:04,004

Ready to go?

01:49:23,802 --> 01:49:25,030
Shall we go?

1088
01:49:25,370 --> 01:49:28,100
Gentlemen, is this necessary?
Must we have everyone?

1089
01:49:28,273 --> 01:49:30,741
We have our own man at the door!

1090

you go twitch somewhere else?

1141
01:54:19,531 --> 01:54:21,999
Everything's fine. No one noticed.

1142
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:25,701
-Everyone's jumping out of their skins.

After tonight, you're in charge.
He knows nothing about show business.

01:55:06,578 --> 01:55:08,569
Two minutes to Best Actress.

1157
01:55:10,282 --> 01:55:12,113
You're an asshole.

So you're quitting show business?

1187
02:00:21,893 --> 02:00:24,418
Too bad. You had talent.

1188
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,125

Our speaker this evening has
been a lone courageous voice.

He alone has challenged those
who have linked organized crime...

1220
02:03:41,092 --> 02:03:44,084
...with legitimate business
throughout our state.

1221

Welcome, Congressman.

Church of lowa Rapids.

...please bless us today as we
meet in friendship and duty.

1226
02:04:13,424 --> 02:04:17,053
And, Lord, whatever dangerous
endeavors those among us may take...

1227
02:04:17,195 --> 02:04:20,130
...let them never be
without Your sanctuary.

1228
02:04:21,132 --> 02:04:22,793
We know in our hearts...

1229
02:04:22,967 --> 02:04:26,368
...that though we may pass through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1230
02:04:26,571 --> 02:04:28,266
...You are with us...

1231
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:31,067
...guiding and protecting us.

1232
02:04:32,143 --> 02:04:33,371
