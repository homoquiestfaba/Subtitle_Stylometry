Thank you for meeting me.

I know we haven't

Well, if Cody told you

1349
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:50,679
you know
that I hate acting.

wanna go see my trailer?

really well.

that teen phase thing?

01:04:19,681 --> 01:04:22,206
I'm glad you're having
a good time.

1394
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:23,424
You know, we don't get

1395
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:25,470
to hear from you
as much now, and...

1396
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:27,472
Yeah, Mom,
I'm sorry about that.

1397
01:04:27,515 --> 01:04:28,908
It's just, you know,
with everything so busy

1398
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,737
I barely have time
to think, you know?

1399
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,915
And what about Briley?

01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,612
How is our favorite
theater star?

1401
01:04:37,656 --> 01:04:39,223
Yeah, how is she, Cody?

1402
01:04:39,266 --> 01:04:42,226
Have you talked to her
about your lovely costar yet?

1403
01:04:42,269 --> 01:04:45,011
No, actually, I haven't.

1404
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,795
We, uh...

1405
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:49,015
We decided we need to focus
on our careers right now.

1406
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,061
You know, with everything
being so crazy--

1407
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:52,845
You know, you can
only use that excuse

1408
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,326
so many times before it
gets a little old, bro.

1409
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:56,980
It's too crazy
to keep up with Mom.

1410
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:58,764

keep up with your sister.

to go to another
press appearance,

with Miss Skankypants costar!

Whatever.

1421

Put it on his tab.
I'm sure he can afford it.

Thank you.

01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:29,447
I'm sorry about her.

1424
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:32,885
She's just... missing
her older brother.

1425
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,542
You know
she's right, though.

1426
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:40,023
It wouldn't hurt to call.

1427
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:41,981
Check in every now and then.

1428
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,510
I better go check on her.

1429
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:53,819
She's probably not gonna
wanna come back in,

1430
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:56,082
so we'll just take
a taxi back home.

1431
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,562
Okay.

1432
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,225
I love you, son.

1433
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,010
I love you, too, Mom.

1434
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:18,365
And, Cody.

1435
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:19,758
I know you may not
be in a place

1436
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:22,195
to hear this right now,

1437
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,241
but don't be so quick
to push aside those

1438
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:27,418
who care about you
the most in life, okay?

1439
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:29,333
And Briley...

1440
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:31,770
They don't make
many like her.

1441
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,641
She is one of a kind.

1442
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:36,644
Don't forget that.

1443
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:39,952
I hate to see you
throw that away.

1444
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:47,046
Call me.

1445
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,048
Soon.

1446
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,007
I will.

1447
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,402
[woman speaking
indistinctly on PA]

1448
01:07:00,277 --> 01:07:03,193
Okay.

1449
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:05,195
[approaching footsteps]

1450
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:09,851
Oh, did someone have
a wild night last night?

1451
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:11,288
Is everything all right?

1452
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:12,854
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1453
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:14,378
I'll be there
in a few minutes.

1454
01:07:14,421 --> 01:07:16,380
Okay, uh, just remember
the press is here today.

1455
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:18,164
You know, we have
that onset visit.

1456
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,079
So, gotta look
alive, right?

1457
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,559
Put your game face on.

1458
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:23,517
And remember, chemistry.

1459
01:07:23,561 --> 01:07:27,434
It sells.
Right, you feel me?

1460
01:07:27,478 --> 01:07:28,696
All right, champ,
see you out there.

1461
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:29,958
Game face!

1462
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:30,394
Yeah.

1463
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:40,534
Game face.

1464
01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:42,014
Let me see that.

1465
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,276
That goes well
with this, too.

1466
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,799
Honestly, this is

1467
01:07:44,843 --> 01:07:46,671
a nice little combination
you got going on.

1468
01:07:46,714 --> 01:07:50,414
Hey, you ready
to put on a show?

1469
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:51,850
What do you mean?

1470
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,678
Oh, you know, giving
the fans what they want.

1471
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,680
[whispering]
Nothing too crazy.

1472
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,688
Thank you.

1473
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:05,559
And, young lady,
how can I help you today?

1474
01:08:05,603 --> 01:08:08,606
Hi, I'm here
to see Cody McClain.

1475
01:08:08,649 --> 01:08:10,216
My name's Briley Williams.

1476
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,175
I should be on the Friends
and Family list.

1477
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:13,437
You have an ID?

1478
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:14,220
Yes.

1479
01:08:14,264 --> 01:08:15,874
Okay, you know the drill.

1480
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,441
This is just a quick live
broadcast from the studio.

1481
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:19,138
So the filming's going well,
what we can expect

1482
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,400
from the movie,
yadda yadda yadda.

1483
01:08:20,444 --> 01:08:21,097
Nothing new.

1484
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:21,706
Sound good?

1485
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:22,620
Yeah.

1486
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:25,579
Okay, they're
on their way.

1487
01:08:25,623 --> 01:08:27,799
You guys look great,
by the way.

1488
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,627
Showtime.

1489
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,759
He's right, you know.

1490
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:33,587
We do look
great together.

1491
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:38,723
Yep, there you are.

1492
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:40,246
Briley Williamson.

1493
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,726
You know
how to get there?

1494
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:43,815
No.

1495
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:45,556
Stage Two.

1496
01:08:45,599 --> 01:08:48,515
Follow the line,
can't miss it.

1497
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:49,516
Okay, thank you so much.

1498
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,170
You're welcome, thank you.

1499
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:52,780
Hello.

1500
01:08:52,824 --> 01:08:54,956
Hi, we're on the set

1501
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,089
of "Ben Pierson:
The Shadow Files",

1502
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,482
and I have
an exclusive interview

1503
01:08:58,525 --> 01:08:59,918
with our two lead actors,

1504
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:01,963
Cody McClain
and Hayley Ryan.

1505
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:09,319
Some of the scenes have
been leaked from the movie,

1506
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:10,929
and they're very steamy,

1507
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:13,845
and I'm just wondering
if any of that

1508
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:17,414
onscreen chemistry
is carrying over

1509
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:19,546
off-screen, if you know
what I mean?

1510
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,508
Um--

1511
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:25,248
Okay, well, I'm really glad

1512
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:27,163
you asked this question.

1513
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:35,083
I know it's been hard
for us to keep it quiet.

1514
01:09:35,127 --> 01:09:38,217
Hey, Briley, right?
How you doing?

1515
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,959
Oh, hi, yeah.
Um, I'm okay.

1516
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:43,091
We're kind
of a thing now!

1517
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:44,658
I mean, it's
so hard not to be

1518
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:47,835
when you have such a strong
chemistry, you know?

1519
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:51,535
I just need to talk with Cody.
Is... he around?

1520
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:53,754
No, actually, he's
super busy right now.

1521
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:55,495
Um, I could take
a message, if you want.

1522
01:09:55,539 --> 01:09:57,454
He's probably
gonna be a while.

1523
01:10:01,632 --> 01:10:03,982
That's okay.
Can you just...

1524
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:06,419
We practically can't keep
our hands off each other.

1525
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:08,204
Can you just, um,

1526
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,118
give this to him
for me, please?

1527
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:13,557
Yeah, no problem.

1528
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,167
Oh, you guys,
that's so exciting!

1529
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,995
I'm so happy for you,
and I'm sure your fans

1530
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:18,779
are so excited
to know this,

1531
01:10:18,823 --> 01:10:21,695
and you guys
heard it here first.

1532
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,308
Okay.

1533
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:27,266
See you later.

1534
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:34,012
Emerson, honey,
it's almost time to go.

1535
01:10:34,055 --> 01:10:35,883
Are you ready?

1536
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:41,062
Oh, sweetie,
what's wrong?

1537
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:43,282
I don't think this story's

1538
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,632
gonna have
a happy ending, Grandma.

1539
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:47,852
It's too sad.

1540
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:51,725
Oh, honey.

1541
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:53,727
Come here.

1542
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:01,039
Now, remember
what I said, dear?

1543
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:03,955
Not all love stories
have a happy ending.

1544
01:11:03,998 --> 01:11:07,698
But it's about
how they end, right?

1545
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:09,787
It's about...

1546
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,789
Wait.
What was it again?

1547
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:14,748
The journey, Grandma.

1548
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:18,448
That's right,
the journey!

1549
01:11:18,491 --> 01:11:21,102
Tell you what.

1550
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:23,975
How about I sit here
with you

1551
01:11:24,018 --> 01:11:26,673
and we can read it together
until it's time to go?

1552
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:28,719
Will that help make it
a little less sad?

1553
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:31,417
Mm-hmm.

1554
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:32,462
Yeah.

1555
01:11:32,505 --> 01:11:36,727
Let's see.
Where did you leave off?

1556
01:11:36,770 --> 01:11:38,598
This one.

1557
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:48,434
"Briley, forgive me
for making this brief...

1558
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:51,176
What was that?!
We're not-- We're not dating!

1559
01:11:51,219 --> 01:11:52,351
Why did you say that?

1560
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:53,657
Cody, chill out!

1561
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:55,136
Of course I know
we're not dating,

1562
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,313
but they wanted us
to put on a show,

1563
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,750
give something
that the fans
could latch onto.

1564
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:02,318
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

1565
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:03,884
Vick, come on, man,
this is crazy!

1566
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:06,626
I mean, I think
it's a good idea.

1567
01:12:06,670 --> 01:12:08,106
The press loves
this kind of stuff,

1568
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:10,064
and I say
we roll with it.

1569
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:13,024
Yeah, okay, just until
the movie releases,

1570
01:12:13,067 --> 01:12:14,330
and then we could
have, like,

1571
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:15,722
some big tabloid
breakup story.

1572
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:17,071
No big deal.

1573
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:18,334
No big deal?

1574
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:20,074
It's a lie.
We're lying.

1575
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,686
Cody, we're actors.
It's what we do.

1576
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:24,165
We act.

1577
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:26,516
It's gonna bring so much
attention to our movie.

1578
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:29,693
What, you don't want
people to think
that we're together?

1579
01:12:29,736 --> 01:12:32,043
I'm-- I'm not saying that.

1580
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:33,827
But we're not together.

1581
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:35,612
What am I supposed
to tell my family?

1582
01:12:35,655 --> 01:12:37,004
You don't have to
tell them anything.

1583
01:12:37,048 --> 01:12:38,484
Nothing, zip.

1584
01:12:38,528 --> 01:12:39,920
Look, all we have to do

1585
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:41,705
is go to a few parties,

1586
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,620
get photographed in public
together a few times,

1587
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:45,404
just to give the press
something to talk about.

1588
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,189
You know, like, keep us
relevant, that's all.

1589
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:51,367
You think you could
manage that?

1590
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:53,412
Come on, Cody, look, I know
it's a little out there,

1591
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:56,720
but this is really good
for your career, trust me.

1592
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:58,243
Besides, that girl
from New York

1593
01:12:58,286 --> 01:12:59,679
is out of the picture,
right, what's her name?

1594
01:12:59,723 --> 01:13:01,420
Briley.

1595
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:03,161
Right, so there's
no down side here.

1596
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:08,645
Fine, I'll do it.
Whatever.

What do you expect?

You have to be a little crazy

You're crazy, too.

It wasn't a stomach bug

All of the above.

Um... no.

01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:32,370
I mean, I've had it
come and go,

1659
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:34,198
but overall it's okay.

1660
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,635
I'm getting used to it.

Now, Briley,
I am required

1667
01:16:50,997 --> 01:16:53,434
to discuss all of
your options with you.

1668
01:16:53,478 --> 01:16:55,219
You are young
and healthy,

1669
01:16:55,262 --> 01:16:57,177
and we don't expect
any complications,

1670
01:16:57,221 --> 01:17:00,659
but... are you considering
the possibility

1671
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:01,704
of terminating--

1672
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:04,837
Dr. King... I know
you're supposed

1673
01:17:04,881 --> 01:17:07,318
to go over all that
stuff with me, but...

1674
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:09,450
I just can't think
about that right now.

1675
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,714
Okay, I just...

1676
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:14,673
I just wanna make you
aware of all your options.

1677
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:16,457

No.

No, he won't.

Okay.

No.

getting sick a lot lately,

I'm totally fine.

1698
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:26,571
I won't be getting
anyone else here sick.

1699
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:28,965
I'm sure of it.

1700
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:31,184
Briley, why were
you late today?

1701
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,449
I had a doctor's checkup.

1702
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:37,669
I just wanted to make sure
I got the all-clear.

1703
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,671
And I did, so...

1704
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,892
Well, your doctor called
the theater company

1705
01:18:42,935 --> 01:18:44,415
earlier today.

1706
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,069

the insurance

1707
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:47,766
for your appointment.

1708
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:52,249

Briley...

1710
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,861
I don't know
what to tell you.

1711
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:57,689
The producers just
don't want to take

1712
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,430
a chance on you
having complications

1713
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:00,779
because of the pregnancy.

1714
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,742
But how can they do that?

1715
01:19:06,785 --> 01:19:09,440
I mean, I-I-I-I--
I'll still be able to perform

1716

for a few months
before anything changes.

1717
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:15,359
And isn't Broadway
starting to offer
maternity leave anyway?

1718
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:17,840
Well, some companies
are starting

1719
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:20,320
to offer maternity leave
for their actresses,

1720
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:21,800
but ours isn't one of them.

1721

I'm sorry, Briley.

1722
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:25,804
I wish that there was
more I could do, but...

1723
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:28,633
this one is just
out of my hands.

1724
01:19:28,676 --> 01:19:32,289

something I can do.

1725
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,421
I mean, this isn't right.

Honey...

1727
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:40,297
I know this is
hard to do,

1728
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:42,647
but have you considered
giving up the baby?

1729
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,389
After all,
you're still a teenager

1730
01:19:45,432 --> 01:19:47,826
and you have such a bright
future ahead of you.

1731
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:51,308
I'm not telling you
what you should do.

1732
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:53,005
I'm just saying
that it's an option.

1733
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:58,054
I'll tell the producers
to hold off

1734
01:19:58,097 --> 01:20:01,274
on their decision while
you think about it, okay?

1735
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:05,409
Okay.

1736
01:20:05,452 --> 01:20:06,802
I'll let you know.

1738
01:20:12,764 --> 01:20:15,723
I wish this weren't the case,
I really do.

1739
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:19,162
But I just don't see
another option for you.

1740
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:21,164
I'll try and buy
as much time

1741
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:23,340
with the producers
as I can, okay?

1742

[Cody]
I don't know how it all
got so screwed up.

1743
01:20:29,215 --> 01:20:31,609
It's like I only saw
one path in front of me

1744
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:33,263
and I kept walking on it

1745
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:36,179
and it led me further
and further away from who I am.

1746
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:38,007
And now, now I'm stuck.

1747
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,965
There's no way out.

1748
01:20:40,009 --> 01:20:43,447
Literally an entire production
is riding on my shoulders

1749
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:46,102
and-- and I have to play pretend
with my real life

1750
01:20:46,145 --> 01:20:47,451
to pull it all off.

1751
01:20:49,018 --> 01:20:50,976

Well, sweetie,

01:20:52,456 --> 01:20:54,197
I don't have
an easy answer for you.

1754
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,373
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

1755
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,157
A career as an actor?

1756
01:20:58,201 --> 01:21:00,899
Yeah.

1757
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:02,553
Yeah, it was.

1758
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:07,906
I just didn't see it
going like this, you know?

1759
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:11,779
Life rarely ever goes just how
we picture it, son.

1760
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:14,870
I just-- I don't think
I know what I want anymore.

1761
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:18,525
For so long, I wanted this
career as an actor,

1762
01:21:18,569 --> 01:21:20,876
and now I have it
and-- and I'm just...

1763
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:22,921
Not happy?

1764
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:25,881
Why don't you call her?

1765
01:21:25,924 --> 01:21:28,971
No, Mom, she doesn't want
to hear from me now.

1766
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:32,409
I treated her terribly.

1767
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:35,803
I wouldn't be surprised

1768
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:37,631
if she never wanted
to hear from me again.

1769
01:21:39,285 --> 01:21:42,549
I can't even imagine
