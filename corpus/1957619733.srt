- Merry Christmas!

- Terance look at you.

00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:18,793
- Hi Grandpa!

7
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,485
- You've grown near six inches.

8
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:21,969
- Hello James.

9
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,177
- Hey, thanks for having us.
- Thank you for coming.

10
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,109
Good to get to see you.

11
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,283
- It's good to see you.

12
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,491
I'm gonna take
these upstairs baby.

13
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:29,079

14
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:30,840
So, how ya feeling Dad?

15
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,048
- I'm getting by.

16
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,429
It's been hard
since your mom died,

17
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,258
but I'm going
through the motions.

18
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,605
- Yeah, I miss mom too.

19
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:40,021
- Grandpa put up
a Christmas tree!

21
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,714
- What!

22
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,164
- What would Christmas
be without a tree?

23
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,442
- [Terence] Can we decorate it?

24
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,374
Can we?

25
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,000
- You do the hanging stuff

26
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:54,967
and I'll do the
stringing stuff okay?

27
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:08,843
[slow instrumental music]

28
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,748
- Here's Santa Claus.

29
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:19,406
- All right, he goes right
at the top of the tree

30
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:22,961
and there's one more
ornament, a very special one.

31
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,206
- Uh huh, that's the last one.

32
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:28,484
- Look a little harder.

33
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:36,595
- Here it is.

34
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,564
- That's Pete.

35
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:40,737
- Who's Pete?

36
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:47,986
- You don't know who Pete is?
- Uh uh.

37
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,470
- Well Dad, we were
hoping that you

38
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,127
would tell him the story.

39
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,473
- You're the Pete expert.

40
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,063
- Well, I can't tell the
story of Santa and Pete

41
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,823
without starting with Santa.

42
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,066
He came first you know.

43
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,035
Do you know what he was
called before the world

44
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:05,175
knew him as Santa Claus?

45
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:06,349
St. Nicholas.

46
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,559
[uplifting instrumental music]

47
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:12,079
St. Nicholas is a Christian
bishop who traveled the world

48
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:14,012
performing small miracles.

49
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,566
People claimed he lived
for hundreds of years.

50
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:20,915
To look at St. Nick, you
might think that God was

51
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,539
about to call him home.

52
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:25,057
The thin on hair on
his head no longer grew

53
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,819
and his beard was
white and wild.

54
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,200
But by all accounts, St.
Nicholas was a gentle man

55
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,685
and children loved him.

56
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,896
No matter where St.
Nick was in his travels,

57
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:38,001
he always returned
home to Amsterdam

58
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,382
to celebrate Christmas.

59
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,040
And one year, he had
to travel through Spain

60
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:44,180
to get to Holland
and in those days,

61
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:48,011
there was still a large
Moorish population in Spain.

62
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,429
As luck would have it, or
as bad luck would have it,

63
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,741
the Spanish government who
knew of his pilgrimages

64
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,434
singled him out for persecution.

65
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,608
- Persecution?

66
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,092
What's that?

67
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,302
- Son, that's when one
group of people don't like

68
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,131
the beliefs of another
group of people.

69
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,685
- I thought St. Nick
was a good person.

70
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,516
- Oh he was, but you see,
in those days the Spaniards

71
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:12,553
and Moors were not getting
along and some people resented

72
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:15,694
his power and his message
of peace and brotherhood,

73
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:19,077
so the Spanish government
arrested him as a spy.

74
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,043
- Spy!

75
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,219
- Of course he wasn't a spy.

76
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,395
But I tell you this, things
didn't look good for St. Nick

77
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,466
on that cold day in December.

78
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:29,570
[whooshes]

79
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,951
- What is this?

80
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,298
- It's called the Book of Life.

81
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,058
- What do you use it for?

82
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:40,167
- It's a list of important names
that I check on every year.

83
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,134
Just about this time.

84
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,356
- It's a very handy
book for a spy.

85
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:01,775
- Ha, we both know
I'm not a spy.

86
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,779
- It's evidence, put it away.

87
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:09,748
What do you have in here?

88
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:14,374
- Chocolate, games, toys,
things of that nature.

89
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:19,309
Tell me, do you
have any children?

90
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:20,276
- Yes, I do.

91
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:27,387
And I can assure you they do
not believe in St. Nicholas.

93
00:06:57,486 --> 00:07:01,421
You made the wrong choice
traveling through Spain old man.

94
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:04,803
It looks like you will
not be making it home

95
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,289
for Christmas this
year or any other year.

97
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,223

- [Grandpa Nicholas] As it
were Christmas only a few weeks

99
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:31,865
away, St. Nick was as far from
home as a present could be.

100
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,835
Lucky for him, he was
about to meet Pete.

- Thank you Peter.

104
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,721
- How did you know my name?

105
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:03,275
- I know a lot of things
about a lot of people.

106
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:08,764
I know you have a big
heart for one thing

107
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:12,457
and I know you want to
travel and see the world.

108
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,668
- You could read my mind?

109
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:20,327
- No, but I can read
what's in your heart.

110
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,572
- You're St.
Nicholas aren't you?

111
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,952
[grunts in affirmation]

112
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,851
What are you doing in here?

113
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,547
- They think I'm a spy. [laughs]

114
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:34,962
- A spy?

115
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,826
- I'm not of course.

116
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,139
The only thing I carry
with me wherever I go

117
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,142
is a message of peace.

118
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,561
- Tell me something St.
Nicholas, you've been a lot

119
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,150
of places, places
I've only dreamed of,

120
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,428
what's it like?

121
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,395
- It's everything
you could imagine.

122
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,952
But I'll add this, wherever
I've been on my travels,

123
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,163
I've found that
people are the same.

124
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:06,649
They love and want to be loved.

125
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:10,998
They want their life
to amount to something.

126
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,070
But they need help sometimes.

127
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,728
That's where I come in.

128
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:22,665
- St. Nicholas?

129
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,496
Will you tell me
about your travels?

130
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,810
- There's a lot to tell.

131
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,125
[slow instrumental music]

132
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,678

two men wound up talking

throughout the night.

134
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,648
To look at them,

135
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:42,305
you might have focused
on their differences.

136
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,411
One was black the other white.

137
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,310
One was a cook the
other a bishop.

138
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,072
But Pete admired St.
Nick's towering spirit

139
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,833
and St. Nick instinctively
knew that Pete had much

140
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,422
to offer the world
with his generous heart

141
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,768
and joyous nature.

142
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:02,671
Just before daybreak, Pete
made the most important

143
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:06,053
decision of his life.

be making their rounds

any time now.

148
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,554
- Peter, why are you doing this?

149
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,900
- Because you're St. Nicholas
and the world needs you,

150
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:00,867
now come on.

151
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,144
- You're taking a terrible risk!

152
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:05,147
- Don't worry about
that, come on.

- Peter, Peter would you
like to come with me?

155
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:18,850
I could use a partner.

156
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:20,162
- Me, I'm just a cook?

157
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,026
- No, you're much
more than that.

158
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,062
But if you can't, I understand.

- Look Nick, you gotta
get outta here right now.

161
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,484
- I had a book, leather
bound, very old.

162
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,246
I can't leave without it.

163

- Why's it so important to you?

164
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:37,800
It's just a book.

165
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,250
- Oh, it's infinitely
more than that.

166
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:41,424
- All right look, I'll go get it

167
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:43,116
and you stay right here okay?

168
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:45,946

really a man named Pete

186
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,367
or are you making all this up?

187
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:06,440
- There was a man named Pete
and his story was passed down

188
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,928
for hundreds of years
until it became legend.

189
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:13,620
- What's so important about
The Book of Life anyway?

190
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:18,142
- Well, only God and
St. Nick knew for sure.

191
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,180
You see, The Book of Life
is filled with secrets.

193

- About people's lives,
past, present, and future.

194
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:31,811
And if anybody else
ever looked inside,

195
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,020
they wouldn't remember
a thing they saw

196
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:35,400
once the book was closed.

Before Pete knew it, they'd
been partners for years.

202
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,865
- Now, I think that we
should plan things out

a little better.

204

pretty well so far.

itinerary, some sort of detailed

209
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:09,469

God plans the itinerary.

- What?

211

- You always tell me what
you think I'm thinking.

216

got a knack for it.

I know the difference

or who's been nice?

annoying knack Nick.

thinking, most of the time.

don't always have to say it.

Maybe, just maybe, I don't
want to know what I'm thinking.

I baked a loaf a few days ago.

were united on one thing,

the children.

The children were always
first in their hearts.

247
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,138
And sure enough as time passed,
the children grew to love

Pete as much as
they did St. Nick.

for their annual
Christmas visit,

251

they discovered that many of
the children were missing.

World with their families.

357
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:59,844
[uplifting instrumental music]

358
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:10,338
What are we stopping here for?

359
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:12,409
- I want to get this
ring to Miss Van Olden.

360
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,411
- She's here?

361
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:16,861
- No, but the Reverend
usually knows everything

362
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,069
that goes on in town.

363
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,456
- Santa and Pete? [gasps]

364
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:26,802
Oh I don't believe this!

365
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,597
It really is you!

366
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:30,392
I heard the rumors that
you might be coming

367
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,362
to New Amsterdam and I can't
believe it, here you are.

368
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,536
Oh, my name is Maria Dangola.

369
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:38,745
- Pleased to meet you Maria.

370
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:42,162
- What on Earth would
bring you to New Amsterdam?

371
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,130
- Mainly, we're here
to see the children.

372
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:46,788
- That, and to ensure that
the tradition of gift giving

373
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:49,653
is carried on here
in the New World.

374
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,794
- Well my children are gonna
be so jealous when they hear

375
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:54,451
that I met you.

376
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:56,038
- Well, perhaps we'll
see them tomorrow night

377
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:57,246
when we do our rounds.

378
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:59,110
- Oh they would love that!

379
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,630
By the way, would
you care to join us

380
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:03,425
for our Christmas Eve feast?

381
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,254
- That sounds
absolutely wonderful.

382
00:22:05,393 --> 00:22:07,395
- Wonderful, that's
sounds wonderful,

383
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,914
but we can't see,
that's the busiest night

384
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:10,984
of the year for us.

385
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,435
- Maria?

386
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:15,092
- Janet, Janet, come here.

387
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,026
Look who it is, Santa and Pete.

388
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,924
This is my sister Janet.

389
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:22,962
I was just inviting them
to dinner tomorrow night.

390
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,413
- Have you accepted
the invitation?

391
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:26,966
- What time would you like us?

392
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:28,416
- [Maria] Say six o'clock?

393
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,659
- We'll be there.

394
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:32,558
- Wonderful, we live on
the outskirts of town

395
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,283
in a place called Harlem.

396
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,355
Just ask of the Dangola family.

397
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:38,702
- Thank you Maria,
we'll see you tomorrow.

398
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,289
- Okay, this is so exciting!

399
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,222
I can't wait to
tell the children!

400
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:47,193
- What, what?

401
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,886
- I thought we were too busy.

402
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:53,786
- Well, I mean, I
thought, you know.

403
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:55,304
You didn't like the fruitcake,

404
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:56,858
so I figured you wouldn't
turn down a free meal.

405
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,103
- I'm sure that's the only
reason you wanted to go.

406
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:06,246
[laughs]

[goat bleating]

408
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,746
- No, no, how did
you get in here?

409
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,818
Those are decorations for
the Christmas program.

410
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:29,338
You can't eat those,
out, out, out.

411
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,789
Oh are you two here for
the Christmas program?

412
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:33,653
Out, out!

413
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,862
Oh, we have everyone we
need for the nativity,

414
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,243
but yah, yah.

415
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,281
Santa and Pete?

416
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,455
Well, that's a wonderful idea.

417
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:44,319
The children would love that.

418
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,562
- Actually Reverend.

419
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,840
- And you'd make
a wonderful Santa.

420
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,255
You're a dead ringer for him.

421
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:50,739
- What about me?

422
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:54,640
- Well, you're a passable
Pete, but Santa here.

423
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:55,641
- Passable?

424
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:57,436
I am Pete.

425
00:24:00,162 --> 00:24:02,337
- You're not saying?
- Exactly.

426
00:24:03,787 --> 00:24:04,719
- Oh my.

427
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:06,375
- Hello Reverend Bogart.

428
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,412
- Santa and Pete.

429
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,553
What an honor that you
would come to our colony.

430
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,175
Oh, and your timing is perfect.

431
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:16,006
The children could use a
little inspiration right now.

432
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,973
- Oh, why is that?

433
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:20,562
- Oh well, it just doesn't
feel much like Christmas

434
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,874
this year.

435
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:24,704
Life is so hectic here
with all the faiths

436
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:28,225
and cultures and so many people
and more arriving every day.

437
00:24:28,363 --> 00:24:31,228
Families have been separated
and not found each other.

438
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,678
- Why that's terrible.

439
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,749
- And then there's the
unrest between the settlers

440
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:35,577
and the Indians.

441
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:37,130
- The Indians?

442
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:38,787
- Yeah, there've been
attacks on both sides,

443
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,409
mostly over land.

444
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,619
I heard yesterday the governor
was planning an attack

445
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:44,413
in retaliation for something.

446
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:46,001
- I can't believe this.

447
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,521
The New World's already
sounding like the old one.

448
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:49,867
- We were led to believe
that we were coming

449
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,732
to a land of peace and harmony.

450
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,459
- Well, that was the
dream St. Nicholas.

451
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:58,358
And I guess you noticed how
commercial everything's become.

452
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,843
- Commercial?

453
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,466
- Well, the establishment's put
up the Christmas decorations

454
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:03,950
a week ago.

455
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:06,297
- That is getting a
jump on things isn't it?

456
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:10,025
- Excuse me Reverend,
Peter, can I have the ring?

457
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:12,131
- I don't have the ring.

458
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,926
- Miss Van Olden's,
I gave it to you.

459
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:15,341
- No, I put it in your bag.

460
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:17,550
- No, I remember,
on board the ship.

461
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:19,759
- No, we were on the
ship and I gave it to you

462
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:21,140
because I didn't want to
be responsible for it.

463
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:22,037
I told you that.

464
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,314
This is so embarrassing.

465
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,247
- You may have told
me, but that's not.

466
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:26,835
- Just looking for it.

467
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:28,009
- Ah, ah, ah.

468
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,012
[slow instrumental music]

469
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,978
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:35,810
We were asked to
deliver this ring

471
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,502
to an Elizabeth Van Olden.

472
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,400
She wouldn't happen to be a
member of your congregation

473
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,229
would she?

474
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:42,817
- Yes, yes she is.

475
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,750
- Ah, do you know
where she lives?

476
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,993
- No, I believe she works

477
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:49,686
at the tannery here
in town though.

478
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,517
- Thank you Reverend and
a happy holiday to ya.

479
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,933
- And to both of you as well.

480
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,073
It was wonderful to see you.

481
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,212
[goat bleating]

482
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,662
Go, go, go, go!

483
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,663
- Reverend?

484
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,495
There's still time for the
dream of a better way of life

485
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:08,428
to become a reality.

486
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,155
- I pray for that
everyday St. Nicholas.

487
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:15,090
[slow sad instrumental music]

488
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,579
- Too busy to
celebrate Christmas?

489
00:26:20,717 --> 00:26:22,891
Trouble between the
settlers and the Indians?

490
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:24,962
- Maybe we were
meant to be here.

491
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,724
We got a lot of
work to do Peter.

492
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:29,484
- Ah, but first we gotta
find us a play to stay.

493
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,383
- Not before we
find Miss Van Olden.

494
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,319
Love is patient but it shouldn't
be kept waiting too long.

[sloshing]

496
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:55,924
- I know, I know, just
like everyone else in town.

497
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:57,098
Waiting till the last minute

498
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:59,238
and want their
boots repaired now!

499
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:03,552
- Actually sir, we're
here on other business.

500
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,796
- We understand you have someone
named Elizabeth Van Olden

501
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:06,832
working here.

502
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,040
- Not anymore.

503
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:09,800
Didn't like working with hides.

504
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:12,285
They made her squeamish.

505
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:13,632
- Don't blame her.

506
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,530
- Do you happen to
know where she lives?

507
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,221
- I do not.

508
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,052
This town's grown so fast it's
hard to keep track of anyone.

509
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,640
- So I see.

510
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:31,373
- By the way, you too
are who I think you are

511
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:34,238
why don't you leave some
coal in my children's shoes?

512
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:35,826
Ha!

513
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:37,690
They haven't been good since
they came to New Amsterdam.

514
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:42,626
[soft instrumental music]

515
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,835
- You want me to put coal
in your children's shoes?

516
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,319
- Yeah, that's what
you do isn't it?

517
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,976
- No, that's not what I do.

518
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:49,322
I don't know where
that rumor got started,

519
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,255
but I do not put coal
in children's shoes.

520
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:52,947
And you know why?

521
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:55,743
Because every child
is basically good.

522
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:58,815
They need to be encouraged,
not told how bad they've been.

523
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:01,334
So when you go hoem tonight
from a long day's work

524
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,820
and they're getting
on your nerves,

525
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,685
try giving them the
biggest hug ever

526
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:09,101
and tell them that
you love them.

527
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:12,691
You do that and I guarantee you,

528
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:14,865
you and your children
will be just fine.

529
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:20,215
- Maybe I'll try that.

530
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:22,839
- Wonderful, well, it
was nice to meet you.

531
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:24,737
I'm glad we had
this chance to chat.

532
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:28,223
And happy holidays to you.

533
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:34,022
- Happy holidays to you too.

534
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:39,131
- Nicely done Peter.

535
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,373
- I've learned from the best.

536
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,237
- Now, lets go book that room.

537
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:43,894
- Oh I can't wait!

538
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:47,380
A warm bath, a feather bed,
after two months on that ship,

539
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,106
it's gonna be paradise!

540
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:57,563
Nothing!

541
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:58,771
- Nothing?

542
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,566
- I told them we've been
every place in town.

543
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,016
I asked him to double
check his ledger.

544
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:04,466
I cajoles, I pleaded, I even
told him I was traveling

545
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:05,985
with the famous St. Nick!

546
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:07,746
- What did he say to that?

547
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:09,955
- No room at the inn.

548
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,578
- Sounds familiar.

549
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:15,063
- But he did mention this
other place outside of town,

550
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,133
but I wasn't sure if--

551
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:17,272
- We'll take it.

552
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:25,177
Well, hardly the best
room in town is it?

553
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,076
- That's not even the
best barn in town.

554
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,667
[clattering]

555
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,913
Knew we shoulda let me
bargain for this place.

556
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:40,123
- I'm too tired to bargain.

557
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:43,195
Besides which that man
may have needed money

558
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,679
more than we did.

559
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:45,611
- Oh I doubt it.

560
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:51,997
- Give freely Peter and you
will enjoy abundance, trust me.

561
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,554
You know, I think it's
rather cozy in here.

562
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:01,006
- If you don't mind
a room with a view.

563
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,078
- It's better than
our accommodation

564
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:06,287
coming over on the ship.

565
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:07,702
- I can't argue with that.

566
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,774
- So, here we are.

567
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:13,501
Tell me Peter, what are
your first impressions

568
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:14,951
of this New World?

569
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:17,746
- A little overwhelming.

570
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,680
I wasn't expecting
so many people.

571
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,406
But frankly, I'm concerned
that we're not gonna have

572
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:24,132
enough gifts for the children.

573
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,825
- I think we're gonna have
just the right amount.

574
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,620
- Let me ask you something Nick,

575
00:30:29,758 --> 00:30:31,899
why is it you're so
positive about everything?

576
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,935
- That's simple Peter.

577
00:30:34,073 --> 00:30:35,661
Being negative is no fun.

578
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,767
[laughs]

579
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,356
[hay rustling]

580
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,117
- What was that?
- What?

581
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:44,843
- Shh!

582
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,744
[slow instrumental music]

583
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:27,126
It's okay, we're
not gonna hurt you.

584
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,302
Come on out, come on.

585
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:35,479
- Pete?
- Yes.

586
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,415
- What's going on?

587
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,280
- Santa and Pete!

588
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,739
- Well obviously you know
our names young lady.

589
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:57,122
I think it's only fair
that we should know yours.

590
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,226
- Marlene.

591
00:31:58,364 --> 00:32:00,815
- Marlene, that's a pretty name.

592
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,887
- Where are your
parents Marlene?

593
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,440
- I don't know.

594
00:32:05,578 --> 00:32:06,925
- Did you get lost?

595
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:10,100
- No, I just fell asleep.

596
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,172
- Fell asleep?

597
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,244
- In the woods where
were building our cabin.

598
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:18,626
Mother and father said it
was okay for me to lie down

599
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:20,214
under a tree.

600
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,804
When I woke up I
couldn't find them.

601
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,018
I don't like it here, I
want to go back to Holland.

602
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:33,917
- Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

603
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:37,921
You'll feel better when
we find your parents.

604
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:40,682
- Can you, can you
really find them?

605
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:42,650
- We will.

606
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,618
Now, that's a promise.

607
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:48,759
- Thank you Santa.

608
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:58,252
- Good night Marlene.
- Good night Santa.

609
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,428
- I'm gonna need a ledger
to keep track of all

610
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,637
these promises you
keep handing out.

611
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,950
First you tell Henry Rutgers
we'll deliver his ring.

612
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:09,090
Then you tell Marlene
we'll find her parents.

613
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:12,093
How do you plan
we'll do all of this?

614
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:13,612
- Don't worry Peter.

615
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:17,754
We'll find Marlene's
parents safe and sound.

616
00:33:19,204 --> 00:33:21,171
- What do you suppose
happened to them?

617
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,347
- They could have got lost.

618
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:27,039
You heard what the Reverend
said, people become separated

619
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:29,490
and then can never
find one another again.

620
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:30,801
- Do you think the Indians
might have anything

621
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,217
to do with this?

622
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:35,461
- I don't know but I
suspect the governor knows.

623
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:39,120
- So tomorrow we find
Marlene's parents,

624
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:42,330
visit all the children,
pass out all their gifts,

625
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:43,366
go to the governor.

626
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:45,540
- Don't forget Miss Van Olden.

627
00:33:45,678 --> 00:33:48,888
- I suggest finding Miss Van
Olden is a low priority Nick.

628
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,341
- Miss Van Olden is very
important Peter, very important.

629
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,446
- Why?

630
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:56,413
I don't...

631
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:01,177
Wait a sec.

632
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,904
You looked in The Book
of Life didn't you?

633
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,045
Come on Nick, level with me.

634
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:08,977
Did you see their names
in there together?

635
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:11,325
Did Henry Rutgers marry
Elizabether Van Olden?

636
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:14,017
Is it fate that we're to
deliver this ring to her?

637
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:19,126
- The Book of Life is not
written in stone Peter.

638
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,060
That's the great beauty of it.

639
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:26,409
Everybody writes
their own story.

640
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:31,724
[slow instrumental music]

641
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,887
[holiday music]

642
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:00,926
[clattering]

643
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:14,905
- Look what we have here.

644
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:16,631
Look at that.

645
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:19,324
Nick you can ride more
comfortably in the New World.

646
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,533
- In this?

647
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:23,190
It's nothing but
a piece of junk.

648
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:25,157
- Oh, no, no, no.

649
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:27,194
One man's junk is
another man's treasure.

650
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:28,126
We can fix it up.

651
00:35:32,337 --> 00:35:33,786
- I prefer riding my horse.

652
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:37,065
It's become a tradition.

653
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,240
- Well maybe it's
time for a change huh?

654
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,041
- I like tradition.

655
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:51,666
- Your chariot
awaits you my lady.

656
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,293
- I'm hungry.

657
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:59,605
- Oh wait a minute, I got
something that'll tide you over

658
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:00,641
till breakfast.

659
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:01,711
- What is it?

660
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,300
- Dried fruit, a Pete special.

661
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,788
- No thanks.
- Fine, be that way.

662
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:12,411
- You mean you're not even
gonna offer her the fruitcake?

663
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:14,862
- No, I'm not even gonna
mention the fruit cake.

664
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,795
[laughing]

665
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,590
Oh fine, go ahead and laugh.

666
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,973
We men of vision are
used to be ridiculed.

667
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,044
Ya, ya!

668
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,395

[door knocks]

671
00:36:57,836 --> 00:36:59,355
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

672
00:36:59,493 --> 00:37:01,115
- [Santa] We'd like to
see the governor please,

673
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,875
it's important.

674
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,878
- [Woman] I'm sorry,
the governor is
having his breakfast.

675
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,017
- [Santa] Oh.

676
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:08,226
- I'm the the governor!

677
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:15,785
- Good morning sir.

678
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,271
- Would you like a cup of cocoa?

679
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:20,238
- Go ahead.

680
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:23,758
- What can I do for you?

681
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:26,347
- We understand that
there's considerable tension

682
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:28,384
between the settlers
and the Indians.

683
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:30,972
- Well, it's not
exactly a secret.

684
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,112
What did you do, just
get off the boat?

685
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,286
[laughs]

686
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:36,530
- Actually, we did.

687
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,256
- There's even a
rumor to the effect

688
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:40,672
that you're planning an attack.

689
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:43,675
- Even if I were
considering such a thing

690
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:45,021
I wouldn't tell you.

691
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,850
Who do you think you are anyway?

692
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:48,300
- My name is Nicholas.

693
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:50,475
This is my partner Peter.

694
00:37:51,924 --> 00:37:55,894
The little girl is Marlene,
daughter of two of the settlers

695
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:58,206
who seem to have disappeared.

696
00:37:58,345 --> 00:38:00,174
- Do you think the Indians
might have anything

697
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:01,037
to do with this?

698
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:02,901
- Yes, I'm sure of it.

699
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,697
All the more reason
for a retaliation.

700
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:09,287
- Well, I'd like to
propose that Peter and I

701
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:12,082
go to the Indians, talk to them,

702
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,016
see if we can find a peaceful
solution to the problem.

703
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:17,467
[laughs]

704
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:20,021
- For one thing you'd
have to find them first.

705
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,886
They're always moving
from one place to another.

706
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:26,994
And if you did find them, we'd
never hear from you again.

707
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:28,236
- And why is that?

708
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:30,929
- These Indians are savages,

709
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:33,034
not to be reasoned
with or trusted.

710
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:35,485
- There's some good
in every man Governor.

711
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,869
May I suggest that you
reconsider your thinking,

712
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:43,424
or at least postpone action
until after the holidays?

713
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:45,012
- I'm the leader of this colony

714
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,084
and I will do what I
think is appropriate!

715
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:49,810
[burps]

716
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:52,157
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
in the middle of my breakfast.

717
00:38:54,055 --> 00:38:56,023
- Do think about it Governor.

718
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:05,343
- Thank you for the cocoa.
- You're very welcome.

719
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,691
- Was the governor a nice man?

720
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:10,865
- Well...

721
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,076
- The word nice
doesn't do him justice.

722
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,735
- Well, does he know
where my parents are?

723
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,808
- Not exactly, but
they did give us

724
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,292
a good idea where to look.

725
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,571
- I remember you
said you were hungry.

726
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,609
Me too, let's go
have some breakfast.

727
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:33,750
Everything always looks
brighter on a full stomach.

728
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,512
[ominous music]

729
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,977
[laughing and chatting]

730
00:39:54,115 --> 00:39:55,220
- A full stomach
is one thing Nick,

731
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:56,359
but you're gonna
put on 200 pounds

732
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:58,154
in one day if
you're not careful.

733
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:02,261
- I don't think I have
much to be scared of there.

734
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,161
[low chattering]

735
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:21,591
Excuse me a minute.

736
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:23,766
- What are you doing?

737
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:24,905
Going back for thirds?

738
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,736
[laughing]

739
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:30,773
- Can I take these carrots
to feed the horses?

740
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,189
- Yes, I think they would
like that very much.

741
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:45,960
[plucky instrumental music]

742
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:48,411
- What on earth?

743
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:51,449
- I traded it a few chocolates
and my old hat for it.

744
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,280
You know, everybody here
is in love with chocolate

745
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,213
and there's none to be had.

746
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,388
- Well it looks like you got
the short end of the stick

747
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,355
on that deal.

748
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:02,460
- You don't like it?

749
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,430
- It's just, it's...

750
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:09,363
- It's different.
- Different, yeah.

751
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:14,402
- It is New Worldish.

752
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,751
- Santa and Pete
the horses are gone!

753
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:31,454
[sweet instrumental music]

754
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:34,215
See?

755
00:41:37,322 --> 00:41:39,082
Look, there's a note!

756
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,164
- Dear sir, we have borrowed
your horses for the soldiers.

757
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,857
This pack animal is a
temporary replacement.

758
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:56,237
Signed the governor.

759
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:57,998
- They took our horses?

760
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:59,620
- Don't worry Nick we're
gonna get them back.

761
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:00,725
- But my horse has been
with me every Christmas

762
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,381
since I can remember.

763
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,452
- I know but this
is the New World.

764
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:07,663
We can start some
new traditions.

765
00:42:07,801 --> 00:42:09,147
Besides, look at this face.

766
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:13,220
Isn't this a face you
could learn to love?

767
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:15,463
- I like her.
- So do I.

768
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:19,502
[babbling noises]

769
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,201
[upbeat instrumental music]

770
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:34,137
So, what do you think
about the reindeer now?

771
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,175
- I still prefer my horse.

772
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,180
[clanking]

773
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,115
- How would you like to put
this around our reindeer's neck?

774
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:47,116
- Yeah!

775
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,611
- What do you write in
those messages anyway?

776
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:01,958
- It differs from
child to child.

777
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:05,617
I want each and every
one of them to feel that

778
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:07,792
God knows them individually.

779
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:13,073
- And that the child too
might grow from knowing God.

780
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:14,350
- That's right Peter!

781
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:16,870
[Marlene giggling]

782
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:19,562
- [Marlene] Come over here, I
want to put this bell on you.

783
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,528
Come on!

784
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:27,328
- You're worried about
Marlene's parents aren't you?

785
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:29,710
- I'm concerned for
everyone involved.

786
00:43:29,848 --> 00:43:32,264
- Peter, I believe
in my heart of hearts

787
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,578
that Marlene's parents
have not been harmed.

788
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:37,476
And I think I know
how to find them.

789
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:40,687
Tonight, after we've had
dinner with the Dangola's.

790
00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:42,447
- After we've had dinner.

791
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:45,105
- We ride out into the forest.
- We ride into the forest.

792
00:43:45,243 --> 00:43:47,832
- And let the Indians find us.

793
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,420
- And let the Indians
find, wait a minute!

794
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,527
That's crazy!
- No.

795
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,771
I think it'll work.

796
00:43:59,602 --> 00:44:02,294
- Okay, I'm willing
to try it if you are.

797
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:08,128
But you know, with everything
going on around here,

798
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:10,993
giving out chocolates and
the toys to the children,

799
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:13,547
seems almost incidental.

800
00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:17,551
- Peter, I've seen a
lot through my life.

801
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:22,901
Wars, famine, people's
dreams being dashed

802
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,456
for one reason or another
and through it all

803
00:44:26,594 --> 00:44:30,391
I've given thanks that I was
the patron saint of children.

804
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,499
They are the ray of hope
through our darkness.

805
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:36,881
That's why we celebrate
them on Christmas eve.

806
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,575
After all, Christmas started
with a child didn't it?

807
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:42,507
- Yes it did.

808
00:44:42,645 --> 00:44:43,439
- And you know what?

809
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:45,027
We'll get everything done.

810
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:46,614
If you have to work all night,

811
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:48,824
we'll deliver the
presents to the children.

812
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:53,483
- That's it!

813
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:58,143
That's it, that's the idea!
- What?

814
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:02,113
- Well, we'll deliver
the gifts to the children

815
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,873
at night while they're sleeping!

816
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,636
- Would be more of a surprise
in the morning wouldn't it?

817
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:09,776
- And more efficient.

818
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:14,712
- Peter?

819
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,544
I think you're on
to something here.

820
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:21,822
- It's easy to think when
you don't have a dead racoon

821
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,892
sitting on your head.

822
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,824
- Ah.

823
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:32,937
- Let me give you
an idea how long ago

824
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:34,317
this story took place.

825
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:37,182
When St. Nick and
Pete first came here,

826
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,185
this whole neighborhood
was nothing but a big field

827
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:43,533
and right in the
middle, two windmills.

828
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:45,432
Broadway was a dirt road.

829
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,641
Harlem was a small village.

830
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:51,610
In the in trails
ran hither and yon.

831
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,682
It was really an
exciting time actually.

832
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:57,962
Of course it was a hard time
too and people didn't have

833
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,481
what we have today in
the material sense.

834
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,001
Children didn't get
as many presents.

835
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:06,280
But see, it didn't
really matter.

836
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:09,836
The spirit of Christmas,
that's what really mattered

837
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:12,217
and it was that spirit that
Santa and Pete carried with them

838
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:15,669
on the first Christmas
eve in the New World.

839
00:46:17,464 --> 00:46:19,569
- We don't have much.

840
00:46:19,707 --> 00:46:20,881
- Give freely Peter.

841
00:46:21,019 --> 00:46:23,850
- I know, I know,
and enjoy abundance.

842
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:25,299
- Exactly.

843
00:46:25,437 --> 00:46:27,267
- I can't believe I'm with
Santa and Pete on Christmas eve.

844
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:29,787
- Well, you better start
Marlene because believing

845
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:31,478
is what Christmas is all about.

846
00:46:34,688 --> 00:46:37,173
- Well, will you look at that.

847
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:40,142
Seems our deer is quite a vixen.

848
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,110
- You know, that's
a good name for her.

849
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:46,010
- What's a vixen?

850
00:46:46,148 --> 00:46:50,083
- Yes, I think I'm gonna let
Peter explain that to you.

851
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:54,466
- Me, wait a second, you
said that you would tell it.

852
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:59,644
[light instrumental music]

853
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:02,095
Let's see, a vixen is a lady

854
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:08,618
who is very popular
with the gentlemen.

855
00:47:17,282 --> 00:47:20,216
[bells clanging]

856
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:21,769
- What are the reindeer's names?

857
00:47:21,908 --> 00:47:23,150
- They don't have any.

858
00:47:23,288 --> 00:47:25,152
- They should all
have one, aye Marlene?

859
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,671
Why don't you start?

860
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:30,675
- Okay, that one in the
front, the big one, Comet.

861
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:32,711
- That's a great name.

862
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,782
How'd you come up
with that one Marlene?

863
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:37,475
- Well, my father and I
saw a comet the first night

864
00:47:37,613 --> 00:47:39,304
we were in New Amsterdam.

865
00:47:40,512 --> 00:47:41,755
He said it was good luck.

866
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:44,516
[swift instrumental music]

867
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:45,483
- Comet it is.

868
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,830
- Your turn.

869
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:50,937
- Dasher, for that
fast one there.

870
00:47:51,075 --> 00:47:52,904
- I like that.

871
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,768
- He looks like a
race horse you know,

872
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,459
dashing to the finish line.

873
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:00,015
- One more.
- Okay it's my turn.

874
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:03,121
I'll name the last
reindeer Cupid.

875
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:06,676
- Cupid?
- Why Cupid?

876
00:48:06,814 --> 00:48:09,231
- Because I believe in the
unifying power of love.

877
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,510
- On Dasher!
- On Cupid!

878
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:14,788
- On Comet!
- And Vixen!

879
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:19,517
[swift instrumental music]

880
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:43,437
- [Maria] Santa and Pete!

881
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:45,957
- [Santa] Maria good evening!

882
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:50,237
- Oh wait.

883
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:53,033
- Look who's here!

884
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,310
Come in, come in.

885
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:57,141
Let me introduce everyone.

886
00:48:57,279 --> 00:49:00,316
This is my husband Big Manuel.

887
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:02,284
- Good evening.
- Santa.

888
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:04,562
Pete.

889
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,771
- And our children,
little Manuel and Julia.

890
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:08,980
- It's very nice
to meet you all.

891
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:11,741
- And this is Marlene.
- Hello.

892
00:49:11,879 --> 00:49:14,744
- Well hello Marlene,
welcome to our house!

893
00:49:14,882 --> 00:49:17,161
Everyone, please make
yourself at home.

894
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:21,751
- I thought the real Santa
and Pete had a big bag

895
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:23,270
with gifts in it.

896
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:24,616
- Julia!

897
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,480
[laughing]

898
00:49:26,618 --> 00:49:28,172
- Right you are Julia.

899
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,070
I'll be right back.

900
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:39,631
- Do you think the horses
could use a drink of water?

901
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,600
- Actually, it's
reindeer now Janet.

902
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:44,395
- Reindeer?

903
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:47,812
- Yes, reindeer and I'm sure
they'd love a drink of water.

904
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,891
- I think Janet is especially
pleased that you and Pete

905
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:01,205
came to New
Amsterdam. [giggling]

906
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:06,451
[reindeer grunting]

907
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:10,904
[sweet instrumental music]

908
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:11,974
- Reindeer.

909
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:14,942
I thought the
reindeer could use.

910
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:17,048
- Let me get that for you.

911
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:24,262
It's a nice night.
- Yes it is.

912
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:40,692
So, Janet, how long have you
been here in the New World?

913
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,935
- About a year.

914
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,005
- Why did you come?

915
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:47,596
- Things weren't going very
well for me back in Holland.

916
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,840
I decided I needed a new start.

917
00:50:51,841 --> 00:50:52,877
- And did you get a new start?

918
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:55,397
- Yes, yes I have.

919
00:50:56,674 --> 00:51:00,781
It's not perfect here,
but it is exciting.

920
00:51:02,438 --> 00:51:07,409
Oh, I think this New World is
full of great possibilities.

921
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:10,067
- You might be right.

922
00:51:11,275 --> 00:51:15,382
- You see, I have
all these dreams.

923
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,280
- Such as?

924
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,006
- I want to be a teacher.

925
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:22,458
- Oh, I think that's a
wonderful dream to have!

926
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:23,563
- You do?

927
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:25,116
- Yes, yes I do.

928
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:28,430
And like Nick always says,
the children are our future.

929
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:31,778
[both laughing]

930
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:35,299
- So tell me, how long will
you be here in New Amsterdam?

931
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:38,716
- Nick wants to get
home pretty soon.

932
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:41,305
- But you've just arrived.

933
00:51:41,443 --> 00:51:42,547
- I know.

934
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:45,378
- Do you want to leave so soon?

935
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:48,588
- I pretty much go
wherever Nick goes.

936
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:54,835
- Tell me, what's
it like traveling

937
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:56,113
with the famous St. Nick?

938
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:58,460
- Oh, it's wonderful!

939
00:51:58,598 --> 00:52:01,325
It's demanding and inspiring.

940
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:07,676
Because of him, I know
that dreams can come true.

941
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:11,473
[sweet instrumental music]

942
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,275
Uh, we better get back inside.

943
00:52:20,413 --> 00:52:22,139
We don't want to keep
the children waiting.

944
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:26,798
Got a, had a bag, the
bag, let's get the bag.

945
00:52:33,633 --> 00:52:36,222
- This is for Julia!

946
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,709
- Yes!

947
00:52:45,438 --> 00:52:46,232
Chocolate!

948
00:52:47,612 --> 00:52:48,751
- [Marlene] Great Julia!

949
00:52:48,889 --> 00:52:50,788
- There's something
else in there Julia.

950
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,515
See what it is.

951
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:55,551
- [Marlene] What is it?

952
00:52:58,347 --> 00:53:00,349
- It's saying something momma.

953
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:04,388
- To some they are
rags, to you a doll.

954
00:53:04,526 --> 00:53:07,080
If you miss Lizzie?

955
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:11,291
Look behind the mill wall.

956
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:13,190
Walk in faith.

957
00:53:13,328 --> 00:53:14,674
- Let's go see, come on!

958
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,506
- How did you know that Julia
had a doll named Lizzie Santa?

959
00:53:19,644 --> 00:53:22,129
- Nick knows a lot of things
about a lot of people.

960
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:27,859
And this is for
you Little Manuel.

961
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:33,071
- Momma, momma, Santa was right!

962
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,867
Lizzie was behind the mill wall!

963
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:40,424
- All right children, you
could stay up a little longer

964
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:42,149
and then it's bedtime.

965
00:53:42,288 --> 00:53:45,256
- Oh, can Marlene stay with us
until her parents come back?

966
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:50,917
- Would you like to
stay with us Marlene?

967
00:53:51,055 --> 00:53:52,712
We sure would love to have you.

968
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:56,647
- I think that
would be wonderful.

969
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,349
- Go ahead, put it in.

970
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:15,838
[slapping and giggling]

971
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,913
I love sugar cookies,
this is great.

972
00:54:27,091 --> 00:54:31,647
- You've made this evening so
special St. Nick, thank you.

973
00:54:33,131 --> 00:54:35,064
- There's one more thing
I might do for you Maria.

974
00:54:36,169 --> 00:54:37,998
I know you're concerned
about your baby.

975
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:42,589
- Well, yes.

976
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:47,905
We lost the last one
and this one is--

977
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:49,251
- Three weeks late.

978
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:00,883
This is for your baby.

979
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:07,683
[rattling]

980
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:11,687
- Nathaniel Paul Dangola.

981
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:17,348
That's the name we
chose, if it's a boy.

982
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:20,247
- He'll grow up to be a
strong, healthy young man.

983
00:55:21,628 --> 00:55:25,218
[sweet instrumental music]

984
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:33,088
- Thank you Santa.

985
00:55:36,402 --> 00:55:38,645
[laughing]

986
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:49,069
[reindeer grunting]

987
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:57,733
[Janet and Peter laughing]

988
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:04,430
- Peter!

989
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:10,194
- I'm ready, let's go.

990
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:14,440
- Where's the bag?
- Oh wait.

991
00:56:17,132 --> 00:56:17,960
The bag.

992
00:56:20,998 --> 00:56:22,033
The bag.

993
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:23,414
- You're driving.
- I know.

994
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:29,455
- Thank you for a
wonderful evening

995
00:56:29,593 --> 00:56:31,318
and a merry Christmas to all.

996
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:33,251
- And to you a good night.

997
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:39,982
[uplifting instrumental music]

998
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:54,928
[bells clattering]

999
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:58,794
- A merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

1000
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:04,455
I like the sound of that.

1001
00:57:23,716 --> 00:57:24,855
Peter.

1002
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:31,931
- Whoa Vixen, whoa Vixen, stop!

1003
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:35,762
[ominous instrumental music]

1004
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:42,528
This was your idea Nick.

1005
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,357
I'm gonna let you handle it.

1006
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:15,699
- It is the man with
the white beard.

1007
00:58:15,837 --> 00:58:18,495
We have waited a long
time for your return.

1008
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,809
- I'm sorry sir, but I
think you have mistaken me

1009
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:24,777
for someone else.

1010
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,815
- Come, join us.

1011
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,932
Your legend has been passed down

1012
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,830
through several generations.

1013
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:48,525
A man with a white beard
came to the Indians.

1014
00:58:50,112 --> 00:58:52,149
It was a good time
for our people.

1015
00:58:53,184 --> 00:58:54,496
Crops were plentiful.

1016
00:58:55,842 --> 00:58:58,258
There was peace
between all the tribes.

1017
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:02,504
There must be a reason
that you have returned.

1018
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:03,850
- Actually, there is.

1019
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:08,372
We have heard that you
may have taken a couple

1020
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,581
of the settlers,
a man and a woman.

1021
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:18,451
These two have a daughter
who misses them very much.

1022
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:23,974
This is Christmas eve,
she could receive no more

1023
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:29,082
wonderful present than to be
reunited with her parents.

1024
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:32,189
- You bring a message of peace?

1025
00:59:32,327 --> 00:59:35,226
- I do, for the sake
of all our children.

1026
00:59:36,642 --> 00:59:39,299
- You have delivered the
same message to the settlers?

1027
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:46,203
- I promise you this,
I personally will
deliver this message

1028
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:48,792
to the governor
of New Amsterdam.

1029
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:53,935
- It is good that you have come.

1030
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:56,696
- I'm glad that we did.

1031
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,287
And now, before we leave,

1032
01:00:05,222 --> 01:00:07,293
these are for the children.

1033
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:14,127
- We also have a gift for you.

1034
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:20,513
[slow native style
instrumental music]

1035
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:32,870
- This is beautiful,
thank you, thank you.

1036
01:00:42,017 --> 01:00:46,815
- It took two full moons to
find the reddest of berries

1037
01:00:46,953 --> 01:00:48,161
to dye this coat.

1038
01:00:49,715 --> 01:00:50,957
- This is perfect!

1039
01:00:53,132 --> 01:00:56,376
In honor of this occasion,
I will wear this coat

1040
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:57,792
every Christmas eve.

1041
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:08,526
- The Indians knew about
a man with a white beard?

1042
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,358
- They have a prophecy that
such a man would come to them

1043
01:01:12,496 --> 01:01:14,981
flying through the air.

1044
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:17,259
- You know dad, what I
loved about this story,

1045
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:19,986
is that is has a
mix of all cultures.

1046
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:21,332
- That's why I love telling it.

1047
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,162
- And this is a Dutch legend?

1048
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,922
- Yes it is and it
takes in to account

1049
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,856
the fact that people
throughout the ages have failed

1050
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:30,376
to bridge the gap between
all the different cultures.

1051
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:32,550
- And that's why Santa and
Peter are so important.

1052
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,762
- Yes, love,
forgiveness, friendship,

1053
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,418
and a playful sense of humor.

1054
01:01:38,556 --> 01:01:40,904
Those are the real gifts
that Santa and Pete brought

1055
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:43,320
to the New World
and they had faith

1056
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,046
that they could
make a difference.

1057
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:46,772
- Grandpa, what's faith?

1058
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:52,743
- Well, it's that thing
inside that you hold on to

1059
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:54,296
until help arrives.

1060
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:56,367
- I knew that would work out.

1061
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:59,301
As soon as we got there,
I thought no problem.

1062
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:01,441
Except we still don't
have Marlene's parents.

1063
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:03,858
- We've done all we
could do for now.

1064
01:02:03,996 --> 01:02:06,619
You can't force the
Indians or the governor

1065
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:08,897
to do something they
don't really want to do.

[swift instrumental music]

1069
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,703
- What on Earth's got
into these reindeer?

1070
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:24,016
- I don't know, it's like
they're possessed or something.

1071
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:31,575
- Janet?

1072
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:36,960
Is this the bucket you
used for those reindeer?

1073
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:38,340
- Yes, why?

1074
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,967
Oh my, that's not
the one with Maria's

1075

special Christmas
concoction in it?

1076
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:49,213
- I'm afraid so.

1077
01:02:49,351 --> 01:02:50,732
- Her secret African recipe.

1078
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:53,424
- The one with the big kick.

1079
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:56,876
- Well, I know what
it does to humans.

1080
01:02:58,084 --> 01:02:59,672
But what does it do to reindeer?

[fast paced instrumental music]

1082

- Stop the carriage!
- I can't!

1083
01:03:10,856 --> 01:03:12,616
- You just don't want
me to get my hat back!

1084
01:03:12,754 --> 01:03:13,790
- No, it's not that.

1085
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:15,481
I really can't
stop these animals.

Whatever's happened
to this team,

1088
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,354
they certainly got the spirit.

[reindeer grunting]

1090
01:03:32,912 --> 01:03:33,948
- Reindeer.

1091
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:43,233
Well, would you look at this.

1092
01:03:43,371 --> 01:03:45,718
Someone's left gifts for us!

1093
01:03:45,856 --> 01:03:48,445
- This must be where the
man from the tannery lives.

1094
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:50,550
- How very kind of him.

1095
01:03:50,688 --> 01:03:52,656
- Not only kind, but
well needed Nick.

1096
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:55,245
You could use a change,
you know, you been wearing

the same style clothes for
about what, 400 years now?

1098
01:03:58,662 --> 01:04:00,491
- Oh you're a great one to talk.

1099
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:03,978
It's a good thing the
Indians gave you that jerkin.

1100
01:04:05,186 --> 01:04:06,946
- Hey, I have my
own sense of style.

1101
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:09,673

go out of fashion.

Last stop, Governor's house.

1108

- It was a good night Peter

1109
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:45,769
- This bag is as heavy as
it was when we started.

1110
01:05:45,907 --> 01:05:48,116
I sure didn't think we'd
have enough presents.

1111
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,297
Where are the shoes?

1112
01:05:58,575 --> 01:06:00,991
The children are gonna be
disappointed in the morning.

1113
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:03,994
- No, we've got to get in.

1114
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:05,064
It's important.

1115
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:13,693
Locked.

1116
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:16,248
They must be afraid
of the Indians.

1117
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:17,594
- Well, if you
want to get inside,

1118
01:06:17,732 --> 01:06:19,492
all you gotta do is knock.

1119
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,287
- I don't want to wake them.

1120
01:06:21,425 --> 01:06:22,564
- What do you suppose we do?

1121
01:06:22,702 --> 01:06:23,703
Go down the chimney?

You okay?

[coughing]

1127
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:52,077
- Couldn't see
very well in there.

1128
01:06:52,215 --> 01:06:54,182
- You need to work on
your entrance Nick.

1129
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,323
- Where's my bag?

1130
01:06:57,461 --> 01:06:59,360
- Santa and Pete!

- Shh!

1132
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:03,778
- Look, I can
explain everything.

1133
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:06,643
You see, the shoes were
supposed to be outside

1134
01:07:06,781 --> 01:07:07,920
and they weren't.

1135
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:10,336
So he looked up and
then the chimney.

1136
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:13,857
Could you just get us the
children's wooden shoes please?

1137
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,755
- The children stopped
wearing their wooden shoes

1138
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:17,619
when they came to New Amsterdam.

1139
01:07:17,757 --> 01:07:19,138
- No wooden shoes?

1140
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,832
- How bout stockings?
- Stockings?

1141
01:07:33,256 --> 01:07:37,467
Looks kinda funny to me.
- No it doesn't.

1142
01:07:37,605 --> 01:07:39,124
- I have to think
about this one.

1143
01:07:39,262 --> 01:07:40,918
- You could think about
it all you want, trust me.

1144
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,955
This, this one's a keeper.

1145
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:45,992
- I thought you might be hungry.

1146
01:07:46,131 --> 01:07:47,994
How bout some cookies and milk?

1147
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:50,204
- Oh, that's so nice of you.

1148
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:52,482
- Now you mention
it, I am hungry.

1149
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,349
- I'd like you to
have this too Santa.

1150
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,351
I must admit, I made
it for someone else,

1151
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:01,870
but it does not look
like he will be coming

1152

it for someone else?

- Yes.

1157
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:18,370
- What is your name?
- Elizabeth.

1158
01:08:19,785 --> 01:08:20,682
- Van Olden?

01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:23,961
- Yes.

- Henry Rutgers asked
us to deliver it to you.

- He loves you very much.

1165
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,816
He'll join you here just
as soon as it's possible.

1166
01:08:50,954 --> 01:08:52,887
He wants to marry you Elizabeth.

1167

- Oh thank you Santa, thank
you so much! [giggles]

Please, keep the hat.

- Well, thank you.

1170
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,316
- It definitely goes
better with the coat Nick.

1171
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,876
- Quite smashing, it is you.
- Oh yes!

[laughing]

1173
01:09:21,398 --> 01:09:23,538
- Have you ever seen
someone so happy Nick?

1174
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:25,678
- I think it's the
best Christmas present

1175
01:09:25,816 --> 01:09:26,852
we've ever delivered.

1176
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:28,371
- Okay, so now you can tell me,

1177
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:30,718
did Henry Rutgers and
Elizabeth Van Olden marry

1178
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:32,651
in The Book of Life.

1179
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:34,031
- They do now.

[slow instrumental music]

1181
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:41,798
- You know the last
stop of the night

1182
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:43,109
and the first Christmas
eve in the New World

1183
01:09:43,248 --> 01:09:45,146
was Santa and Pete.

1184
01:09:45,284 --> 01:09:46,768
- What about Marlene?

1185
01:09:46,906 --> 01:09:48,805
- Well, I didn't say that
was the end of the story.

1186
01:09:48,943 --> 01:09:53,258
- Remember the promise that
Santa made to the Indians?

1187
01:09:54,466 --> 01:09:55,881
Well, before he left
the governor's house,

1188
01:09:56,019 --> 01:09:58,470
he wrote him a letter and he
explained how he had visited

1189
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,645
with the Indians and how he
felt there could be peace

1190
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:03,613
between them and the settlers.

1191
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:05,787
- Peace on Earth,
good will toward men.

1192
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:10,965
- That was Santa's
Christmas message.

[uplifting instrumental music]

1194
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:23,184
- Let me ask you something.

1195
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:26,567
If I were to look in the Book
of Life and found my name,

1196
01:10:26,705 --> 01:10:27,982
would I remember what I seen?

1197
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,017
- No you wouldn't.

1198
01:10:30,053 --> 01:10:31,192
But I'll tell you this.

1199
01:10:32,607 --> 01:10:36,162
If I get on a boat this week
to sail back to Holland,

1200
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:39,959
you're not with me
I'll understand.

1201
01:10:40,097 --> 01:10:42,272
- Oh, I'd call that
jumping to conclusions.

1202
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,101
I only meet Janet tonight.

1203
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,482
- So you were
thinking about her.

1204
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,244
- Of course I was,
she's a wonderful woman.

1205
01:10:49,141 --> 01:10:50,522
I've never met anyone like her.

1206
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,317
- So stick around for a while.

1207
01:10:52,455 --> 01:10:53,525
See what happens.

1208
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:56,044
- What are you trying
to get rid of me?

1209
01:10:56,182 --> 01:10:57,770
- Don't tell me you
haven't been thinking about

1210
01:10:57,908 --> 01:10:59,807
settling down.

1211
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:02,844
You'd made a wonderful
husband and father.

1212
01:11:02,982 --> 01:11:05,571
I've never seen anybody who
is better with children.

1213
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:09,817
And remember Peter,
there's no higher calling

1214
01:11:09,955 --> 01:11:10,921
than being a parent.

1215
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,511
- What about you?

1216
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,893
When are you gonna get
married and settle down?

1217
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:18,895
- Me, married?

1218
01:11:19,033 --> 01:11:21,932
Ha can you picture that?
- Absolutely, I can.

1219
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:23,451
Mrs. St. Nick.

1220
01:11:23,589 --> 01:11:26,696
- I'm on the road
too much to marry.

1221
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,353
- Well, you can't be
on the road forever.

1222
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:30,838
And besides, you talked about
cutting back on traveling.

1223
01:11:30,976 --> 01:11:32,218
- That's true.

1224
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:38,155
Perhaps if I were to meet
Mrs. Right I'd settle down

1225
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:40,848
and move up north.

1226
01:11:42,988 --> 01:11:44,472
- Hey wait a second.

1227
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,303
Did you ever look your name
up in The Book of Life?

1228
01:11:47,441 --> 01:11:50,823
- My name's not in there.
- It's not?

1229
01:11:50,961 --> 01:11:54,448
- The one name that's a
complete mystery to me is my own

1230
01:11:55,725 --> 01:11:58,624
and I wouldn't have
it any other way.

[sweet slow instrumental music]

1232
01:12:08,531 --> 01:12:11,154

whoa, Vixen, whoa.

1233
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:32,693

[slow sad instrumental music]

1235
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:32,684
The last thing I want
to see on Christmas eve

1236
01:13:33,926 --> 01:13:36,101
is a sad little girl.

1237
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,037
- You said you'd
find them Santa.

1238
01:13:41,175 --> 01:13:42,763
You promised.

1239
01:13:42,901 --> 01:13:43,798
- I did indeed.

1240
01:13:48,976 --> 01:13:51,012
Go to the window, look outside.

[slow instrumental music]

1242
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:10,618
- I don't see anything.

1243
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:13,828
- Outside, look again.

1244
01:14:32,778 --> 01:14:34,400
- Mother, father!

1245
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:36,092
I knew you'd find em!

[uplifting instrumental music]

1248
01:14:42,098 --> 01:14:43,996
- You knew they were
coming didn't you?

1249
01:14:46,205 --> 01:14:48,518
- I had a hunch.

1250
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:52,108
- You're good Nick,
you're very good.

1251
01:14:57,389 --> 01:14:59,633
- [Marlene] Mother, father!

01:15:12,818 --> 01:15:14,544
I missed you so much.

1255
01:15:25,382 --> 01:15:28,903
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, thank you Santa.

1256
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:36,808
- Bye bye dear.

1257
01:15:41,226 --> 01:15:43,297
- Yes, the Lord does
work in mysterious ways.

1258
01:15:43,435 --> 01:15:44,988
- Let's go partner.

1259
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:52,789
- [Pete] Looks like Vixens'
got more company Nick.

1260
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:57,553
- Five, six, I draw
the line at eight.

1261
01:15:57,691 --> 01:16:00,521
- Well, I'll tell you one
thing, even with six reindeer,

1262
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:03,938
there's no way you're going
in that carriage tonight.

1263
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:06,562
- I'm afraid she's right Nick.

1264
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,634
With all this snow
I think we're stuck.

1265
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:11,359
- [Maria] You
could stay with us.

1266
01:16:11,497 --> 01:16:14,190
- We really must be on
our way tonight Maria.

1267
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,227
- I might be able
to help you out.

1268
01:16:20,506 --> 01:16:22,750
I'm known as quite a
handy man in these parts.

- You're a magician Manuel.

1272
01:17:10,073 --> 01:17:12,317
- No, that would be you Santa.

1273
01:17:12,455 --> 01:17:14,733
I'm just good at fixing things.

1274
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:17,080
- Can't you stay a
little while Santa?

1275
01:17:17,218 --> 01:17:18,944
- Time for me to go home Maria.

1276
01:17:21,153 --> 01:17:22,258
- What about Pete?

1277
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:25,192
- I can't speak for him.

1278
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:30,922
- So you just came back
to check on Marlene?

1279
01:17:31,957 --> 01:17:33,338
- Not just that.

1280
01:17:34,857 --> 01:17:36,824
I also wanted to tell you
that we'll be back again,

1281
01:17:36,962 --> 01:17:37,756
next year.

1282
01:17:40,759 --> 01:17:43,659
I sense that I still have
important work to do with Nick

1283
01:17:45,108 --> 01:17:46,903
and I sense that you have
important work to do.

1284
01:17:48,008 --> 01:17:49,872
- Do you really?
- Absolutely.

1285
01:17:51,045 --> 01:17:53,807
And I think you'll make
a wonderful teacher.

1286
01:17:53,945 --> 01:17:54,739
- Thank you.

1287
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:03,299
- Well, I'll see you next year?

1288
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:06,233

[sweet instrumental music]

1290
01:18:21,766 --> 01:18:24,354
- You did a great
job Big Manuel!

1291
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,218
- Only the best
for Santa and Pete.

1292
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:31,189
Oh, by the way, how did the
reindeer behave this evening?

1293
01:18:32,328 --> 01:18:33,709
- They were a
little rambunctious.

1294
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:38,437
- Just be sure to keep
tight hold on the reigns.

1295
01:18:38,575 --> 01:18:39,818
- Believe me, I will.

1296
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:46,411
- I do believe this is the
best Christmas I've ever had.

1297
01:18:46,549 --> 01:18:50,173
- Oh, it certainly has
been for us too Santa.

1298
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:51,588
- Take care of yourselves.

1299
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:03,600
- You sure this
is what you want?

1300
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,189
- I don't have a choice.

1301
01:19:06,327 --> 01:19:09,468
Besides, if I'm meant to
have a family, settle down,

1302
01:19:10,538 --> 01:19:11,885
I believe it will happen.

1303
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:17,097
- I believe it will too Peter.

1304
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:22,033
- By the way, why did Big
Manuel ask about the reindeer?

[playful instrumental music]

1306
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:26,934

- Dad it gets better
every time you tell it.

1315
01:19:57,482 --> 01:20:01,106
- My favorite part is when
they go flying off in the end.

1316
01:20:01,244 --> 01:20:03,453
- Oh, you know my favorite
part was when Big Manuel

1317
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,628
tells the kids it's
time to go to bed.

1318
01:20:05,766 --> 01:20:09,770
- Aw Dad, can I stay up
just a little longer please?

Santa and Pete could be here

at any moment.

- Wait a minute, how
they gonna know I'm here?

1322
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:17,398
- Santa knows a lot of things

1323
01:20:17,536 --> 01:20:19,745
about a lot of people remember.

1324
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:21,092

little bit sweetie.

remember the first time

I heard that story.

I was just as
excited as Terence.

Christmas was in this house.

and Dad's and yous.

back to the beginning,

that's funny, I can't remember.

story didn't you Terence.

- I saw it Grandpa.

1360

you're the one person
in every generation

the family history

responsibility to pass it on.

someone might be me?

someone alive to call your
name, you'll never die.

name every Christmas.
