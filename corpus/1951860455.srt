1
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:30,994
<i>The box.</i>

2
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,628
<i>Let's get out of</i>
<i>the fucking box, guys.</i>

3
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,027
This is reality.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,208
Every week these guys
pick someone to give them a car.

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:50,312
And they give the cops the plate
number and the coordinates.

6
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,142
This guy races around like crazy
all around Moscow.

7
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,824
And if they do it for 35 minutes
without getting caught, the car's his.

8
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,421
That's Russia
and that is great TV.

9
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,090
- I like it.
- You wanna do that here?

10
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,793
No. I want to go even bigger.
Better.

11
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:07,625
That would work.

12
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,329
Alright, guys,
what do we got?

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,227
- This is good.
- Awesome.

14
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,900
Check this out. We got pitched
this reality TV thing from the LAPD.

15
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,875
It's called Jail Bait.

16
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,733
And you should like that.

17
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,475
They take high school girls and put
them through the police academy.

18
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,709
Six months later,
they put em' on the force.

19
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:27,976
They're working the beach,
in bikinis, trying to bust guys...

20
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,739
who are into underage girls.

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,078
You're gonna get athletes,
you're gonna get lawyers.

22
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,995
Our competition is trying to crash
a 747 live into the desert.

23
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,061
Half the shows being pitched have...

24
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,296
detectives catching unfaithful
wives actually screwing on camera...

25
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,134
and you're bringing me
warmed over cops?

26
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,396
What gives here, Davey?

27
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:50,399
Come on, shows like that? Please.
There's no story, no drama.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,061
There's nothing to sustain
an audience for an hour.

29
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,706
- Dave. Do you read the trades?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,480
Look what I have here. Idol,
32 share, 20 rating.

31
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,653
Survivor 45 share, 28 rating.

32
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,052
That's our competition.

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,717
I'm sure when those shows
were being pitched...

34
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,944
there was some obstreperous dead
weight in the room going "no way."

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,556
Davey, don't be that guy.
You're smarted than that.

36
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,659
We just gotta find a way in.
Get the same adrenaline rush.

37
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,397
That's what auto racing is about,
after all.

38
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,562
The chance you'll see some poor
suckers car roll over three times...

39
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,461
and then burst into flames.
Please, you know you love it.

40
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,442
The ratings are great.

41
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,740
The potential to see people die
is an unbelievable draw.

42
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,938
People would watch Russian
Roulette if given the chance.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,644
What?

44
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,417
What?
What you just said.

45
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,089
It was a joke.

46
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,327
You're joking, right?

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,958
Wow. Could you imagine?

48
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:50,130
Could you imagine the numbers we'd
get if people tuned in...

49
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,037
actually knowing somebody
was going to die on air?

50
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,502
She's kidding.

51
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,169
The numbers would be good.

52
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,737
Katie.
Katie, you can't do that.

53
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:01,804
Don.

54
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,543
Katie. Katie and entourage.

55
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,586
- Just a fast legal question.
- The answer's no.

56
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,788
Kidding, what is it?

57
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,515
Without passing judgment,
give me your opinion as a lawyer.

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,457
What if we could put on a show that
would involve Russian Roulette?

59
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,292
Would that be legal?

60
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,294
The chances of us airing
it would be zero.

61
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,872
Is that your legal opinion?

62
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,766
That's a common sense opinion.

63
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,873
When you get a legal opinion,
call me.

64
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,659
Six people will get rich, and
one will also get killed on the air.

65
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,525
You know, Katie, I don't think
New York is gonna go for that.

66
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,121
New York? There's exactly one
reason why New York hired me...

67
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,158
why you hired me.
Numbers.

68
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,098
And this thing is a ratings monster.

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,501
Of course I'd like the ratings,
but we have to serve our audience...

70
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,044
in a way that they'll respect us.

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,571
Tom, come on. Come on.

72
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,842
- Our sit-coms are getting creamed.
- Not all of them.

73
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,547
Our so called dramas are pathetic...

74
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,181
and even our shitty re-runs are
even doing better...

75
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,089
than the smarmy reality
we're making.

76
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,188
What we have is old.
It's dodgy and it doesn't work.

77
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,516
But now, we can change all that.

78
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,918
With Russian Roulette?

79
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,820
I didn't invent the game.
I'm just making it hip again.

80
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,766
Listen, Katie...

81
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,103
Listen, would you give us
five minutes alone?

82
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:40,128
When Katie gave me permission to
film, I was promised full access.

83
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,478
I don't care,
who gave you permission.

84
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,510
I'm president of the network.

85
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:48,078
Why don't you put your camera down?
There's a Starbucks downstairs.

86
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,375
Just leave your stuff right here
and grab a cappuccino.

87
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,918
That's fine.
Hey, can you do me a favor?

88
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:58,827
Thank you.

89
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,196
What a pain in the ass.
I can't believe you let him in here.

90
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,799
With the numbers we have,
we need all the publicity we can get.

91
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,340
Good publicity.

92
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,773
Don't worry. I mean, please.
I could manipulate him.

93
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,245
I wouldn't be so sure.

94
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,609
You and him.
Hey, you know.

95
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,183
Oh, I'm-he's very cute,
but no. No.

96
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,588
- You could do a lot worse.
- I have.

97
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,451
Now, this idea,
and all it's lunacy.

98
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,627
If anyone else had brought it to
me, I'd dismiss it out of hand.

99
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:40,335
But Katie, you gotta admit,
this crosses the line.

100
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:45,036
The line? What line?
Look at any network, any night.

101
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,529
Carve up your face, stab your
best buddy in the back...

102
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,764
and screw his girlfriend.

103
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,476
People wanna watch what
they wanna watch...

104
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,016
and if we don't give it to them,
we are history.

105
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,785
We still got standards and
practices to worry about.

106
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,479
Please.

107
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,085
We still got those assholes at
the FCC and the affiliates.

108
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:06,629
You think that the stations, ours
in lowa are gonna like this?

109
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,952
I think, no, fuck that.

110
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,619
I know our station in Des Moines
is getting sick of being...

111
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:15,368
creamed every night
by CBS and NBC.

112
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:23,481
Back then, when somebody said they
get killed on the air when you said that,

113
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,282
it gave me a hard-on.

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,945
Really.

115
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,349
Really?

116
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,485
I never got that before at
a meeting.

117
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,352
Cool.

118
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:36,858
Do it.

119
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,848
What a day.

120
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,086
Why should I be up? Katie just
pitched me her resignation letter.

121
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:05,123
After they heat about this,
she's gone. Finito.

122
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,121
I want you to go surfing.
Works for me.

123
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,387
Sorry, Dylan, the web.

124
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:16,130
Now go and, oh, go and find me
examples to back this thing up.

125
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,930
Okay, what kind of examples?

126
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,829
People who refuse to accept
conventional wisdom...

127
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,035
on what could or couldn't be done.

128
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,532
Magazine articles, papers.

129
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,377
Download me pictures too.

130
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:35,050
I wanna put this not as some piece
of fluff, but as a historical event.

131
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,150
Not to be too skeptical, but it
could take a while to find articles...

132
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,255
that are going to call putting Russian
Roulette on TV a historical event.

133
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,929
If you have any pictures,
I'll give you history. Go get em'.

134
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,355
From the Roman Coliseum
where it was standing room only...

135
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,932
to watch the Christians be
fed to the lions...

136
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,140
to the crowds in Paris
who gathered to watch...

137
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,678
the guillotine lop the heads of
Louie XIV and Marie Antoinette...

138
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,448
man has always been fascinated
by death, right?

139
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,853
And more importantly,
with witnessing death.

140
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,821
And we're another milestone in the
great continuing world history.

141
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,755
- Dave.
- What about this?

142
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,223
We have a set,
like a game show...

143
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:22,156
have a host, his hot woman
assistant and all that.

144
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,301
We find six people who'll be
willing to risk it all a million...

145
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,305
and we bring them on, one a time.

146
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,968
That's good.

147
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:36,311
And how's this? During the show,
the host interviews them...

148
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,018
so we can develop our favorites and
cheer for them before they pull the trigger.

149
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,081
Defiantly. That would work.

150
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,352
Guys, we are gonna be pilloried
if we put this on the air.

151
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,357
Of course
we're gonna be pilloried.

152
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:52,053
But the more we get pilloried, the
more publicity, and the more ratings...

153
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,489
when this thing goes live
into America's living rooms.

154
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,470
Although,
this is a new network for me...

155
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,837
it's wonderful to see so
many familiar faces.

156
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,736
And I think it's fair to say...

157
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:08,578
that no one in our business
respects advertisers like I do.

158
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:13,602
We stroke you back, Katy.
But we got a problem...

159
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,381
"Live!".

160
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,379
At least we're in sync. If what
the news is saying is true...

161
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,518
no company, in their right
mind is gonna touch it.

162
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:24,455
I don't expect you to touch it.
I expect you to embrace it.

163
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,491
To fight like hell to buy
commercial time on it.

164
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,692
- You must be dreaming.
- I'm not.

165
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,028
I'm not.

166
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,672
Guys, our house is
on fire...

167
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,340
and instead of calling for the fire
department, we're watching it burn.

168
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,374
But you know what?

169
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,012
Until recently, sports was
in the exact same predicament.

170
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,521
If you'll let me, I'll show you something
prepared by our sports gang.

171
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,488
It's sayonara Monday Night Football,
hello X-games. Watch this.

172
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,247
That is the future of sports.

173
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,572
Let me tell you something.
Right here! Right now!

174
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,420
I'm gonna
give you the future of primetime

175
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,121
Unprecedented programming,
unprecedented ratings.

176
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,853
And the only question you have
to ask yourselves is...

177
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,591
are you in or are you out?

178
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,233
Well, that went as badly as
it could be.

179
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,198
What is it?

180
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,042
Corporate stupid bullshit.
What's going on?

181
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,867
It's pretty obvious,
don't you think?

182
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,202
No lawyer's gonna kill my show.

183
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,867
No? Last time I checked,
suicide is illegal in this country.

184
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,547
- That's my legal opinion.
- This isn't suicide.

185
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,680
It's a game show. There's only
the possibility of killing yourself.

186
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,149
I don't buy it. And neither will
Standards and Practices and the FCC.

187
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,526
So, Katy, get real.

188
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,651
What's the difference
between this...

189
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,530
and those freeway chopper
chases on the news...

190
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,694
which end up with the guy getting
shot by the cops or killing himself?

191
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,771
- That's news.
- No, that's ratings.

192
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,534
And then you show it, everyone
rushes to their TVs...

193
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,739
with this huge expectation that
the guy's gonna blow his brains out.

194
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,905
But do you stop showing it?
No, of course not.

195
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,179
You go ahead, then I'm gonna have
to go to New York with this.

196
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,978
Don't you think they already know?

197
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:33,656
Knowing is one thing. But putting
it on, is completely different.

198
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,960
Too late, we've announced.
I have auditions on Friday.

199
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,930
Have your auditions.
You just can't have the show.

200
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,840
Dylan!

201
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,369
Here ya go.

202
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,711
How's it look?

203
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,514
Heat's rising, thanks to you.

204
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,141
And no more being in
last place pitched.

205
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,505
No more garbage?

206
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,282
Top shelf.

207
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,388
Tee em' up.

208
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,923
It's called "Sperm Count".

209
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:11,387
A very cool group of selected men
compete to be the father...

210
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,628
with the hottest girl on either
side of the Atlantic.

211
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,592
Once we've narrowed our field
to our two finalists...

212
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,663
we put identifying dye
on two globs of sperm...

213
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,834
and using a specially
designed vag-cam...

214
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,503
we film the sperm racing forward
to see which will reach the egg first.

215
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,473
The BBC love it.

216
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,348
Flat Lining.
The name says it all.

217
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,151
We take contestants, we stop their
hearts for an instant...

218
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,085
longer is we could get away with it.

219
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,963
"Tits and Ass". Basically
"E<i>xt</i>reme Makeover" with an edge.

220
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,794
Line-up of girls show us their breasts,
just like they do over in Italy...

221
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,097
but only here we have
to put on the slightest blur.

222
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:59,676
After that, a studio audience votes
on which one deserves the boob job.

223
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,440
Then, we have an operation in
front of the studio audience.

224
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,349
So, in one package,
we have it all.

225
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:10,447
Tits, blood, heroic doctors
and the big reveal.

226
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:12,415
Bad day?

227
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,349
Nah.

228
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,115
Normal day.

229
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,422
People always say they can't believe
how bad what's on TV is.

230
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,397
You should see what's not on TV.

231
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:27,100
Tomorrow marks the big day for ABN's
controversial new show "Live!".

232
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,992
And here to talk about it is
Katy Courbet...

233
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,173
the newly appointed president of
programming for the ABN.

234
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,075
A woman that shakes things up
no matter where she goes.

235
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,077
Now first of all, Katy,
just an hour ago...

236
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,973
we were told by sources high
at the network...

237
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:46,014
that ABN has changed it's mind
and plans to cancel the new show.

238
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:55,633
Plumy, we are absolutely
going ahead.

239
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,026
Okay. Okay.

240
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,162
And if you don't mind,
I have brought along some photos.

241
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,271
You know who this is, right?

242
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,574
Well, of course, but why don't
you tell us about him.

243
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,409
This is Steve Jobs.
And before he came along...

244
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:15,649
the idea of owning your own personal
computer seemed completely crazy.

245
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:22,318
But Steve created the Apple computer
and our world was changed forever.

246
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,494
And, of course, you know who this is.

247
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,131
Oh, well that's easy.
That's John Glen.

248
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,032
Well, very very close.
Buzz Aldren.

249
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:36,134
When Apollo 11 when up to the moon,
many thought it wasrt going back.

250
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,876
But they made it, fulfilling one
of mankind's most enduring dreams.

251
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,571
The Apollo 11 astronauts and Jobs
all pushed the envelope...

252
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,643
and that's what we're doing
with "Live!".

253
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,721
Sometimes life offers
great opportunities.

254
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,652
If any of you want to be a part of
one of the great historic events...

255
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,595
then please consider auditioning.
We'd be honored by your presence.

256
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,364
Rex. Holy shit, this is for us.

257
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,402
Those are contestants.

258
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:15,973
Hello.

259
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,909
- Katy, Dylan, hello.
- Hey Jim.

260
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:24,645
You are gonna love the list. I must
admit I was skeptical as anyone.

261
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,624
But this list, my God.
What a list.

262
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,893
- You ready?
- Hit me.

263
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:36,966
Death. Staring it right in the
Face and finally caving into it.

264
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,572
First, it started in my stomach...

265
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,243
and then the cancer spread to
my lymph nodes...

266
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,842
and now it's in my lungs.

267
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,077
There's just no good wars anymore.

268
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,843
<i>I can't put on a show with</i>
<i>a bunch of suicidal types.</i>

269
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,885
Where's the drama in that?
Where's the fun in that?

270
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,051
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

271
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,387
So what are you gonna do?

272
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,699
Something fast. Or I'm gonna
be as pathetic as they are.

273
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,537
You and I will be
in the same boat, though.

274
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,566
Yeah, how's that?

275
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,776
I won't have a show and
you won't have a film.

276
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,813
It's great. A Fuji.
It's really crunchy.

277
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:44,499
Well, I have a...

278
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,298
What?

279
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:55,035
Could you kill the camera, please?

280
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,681
- I have an idea.
- You do? Okay.

281
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,578
Kill the camera. Seriously.

282
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,323
No, no, no, just go with it.
You can always cut it out later.

283
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,850
When you offered a million dollars,
look what happened.

284
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,048
It seemed like a lot to me,

285
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,729
I don't know, I look who you got.

286
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,964
What you really need is a crowd
that would never kill themselves.

287
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:28,010
- What you need to do...
- Raise the pay up.

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,512
Is probably, yeah, raise the pay up.

289
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,845
Like three or four million.

290
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,446
Or more.

291
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,181
- Or more.
- Or more.

292
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,354
Listen to the prince
of nobleness now.

293
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,655
It's not hard to be
more noble than you.

294
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,230
Don't worry,
we can manipulate him.

295
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,572
You filmed that?

296
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,408
I like that.

297
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:10,281
- You do?
- Absolutely. And I like this idea.

298
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,151
Just got another idea.

299
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:19,692
Okay, we make the payoff huge,
but we only pay the survivors.

300
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:24,225
And no spinning the barrel each
time. One spin and everyone goes.

301
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,172
That's gonna get their attention.

302
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,496
You're good. You get it.

303
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,364
No, I'm just deserving.

304
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,174
Right.

305
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,001
<i>Five million dollars each.</i>

306
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:41,952
<i>Right. Five million dollars and</i>
<i>the family of the loser gets nothing.</i>

307
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,387
- That just does not seem right.
- Yeah, very unfair.

308
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,992
Now we're rocking.
Okay, what do we do?

309
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:51,552
Do?

310
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,161
Yeah, what do we do?

311
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,783
We chat up the contestants
for thirty seconds...

312
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,292
and then we hand them a gun?
We're talking a very short program.

313
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,762
We could go with a half hour show.

314
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,767
Defiantly. That might work.

315
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:08,201
And write off half an hour of lucrative
commercial time? Are you kidding?

316
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:14,777
How's this?
Between each person going...

317
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,380
we do those things they do with
the athletes at the Olympics...

318
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,849
like those up-close and personal
biographies, like vignettes.

319
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,554
Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,184
- The backgrounds.
- Bio-documents.

321
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,154
- Kinda brilliant there, Dave.
- Thank you.

322
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,318
Kinda brilliant. Jeeze,
welcome to the team, buddy.

323
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,931
Took you long enough.
Good to have you home.

324
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,873
That's great.
It's good huh?

325
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,613
And guess
who we hire to do it?

326
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,111
You do the segments,
you ask the questions.

327
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,980
- Best way to understand the subject.
- I can't.

328
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,120
Why not?

329
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,227
I can't make your segments and
be able to film at the same time.

330
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,324
Oh, please. You can do your little
film and keep eating rice...

331
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,166
or you could burn some mid night
oil, do my segments...

332
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,202
and finally have some steak.

333
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,066
If you think you have what it takes
to make it in the majors...

334
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,836
and I know you do,
here's your chance.

335
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,004
Amazing. And this is just LA.
Imagine the regional auditions.

336
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:23,817
You think?

337
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:25,554
I know. Yeah.

338
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:27,181
Katy.

339
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:30,184
Yeah.

340
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,890
- We need to talk.
- This afternoon.

341
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,853
No, no, now. And, alone.

342
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,729
No their fine.
This is for the...

343
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,025
No, forget about it.

344
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,004
You're fucking me here.

345
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,228
I'm saving this network, and you're
telling me I'm fucking you?

346
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,171
You are casting and funded some
sort of close-up segment.

347
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,377
- Tell me that's not true.
- I can't.

348
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,049
- With what money?
- I found money.

349
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,245
What, with your credit cards?
You think this is your call.

350
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,712
It's not.
There is no green light.

351
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,646
Last I heard,
we were still discussing.

352
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,310
No, no, we're not discussing it.
If we go ahead with this...

353
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,161
the FCC is going to have me,
have us for lunch.

354
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:11,553
Now listen to me, there is no show.
Let me say that again. No show.

355
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,788
I got to get back to you
on that one, Don.

356
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,638
Katy, this show is no where
near green lit.

357
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,806
And tonight they're gonna slice
and dice us on Counter Attack.

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,680
On Counter Attack? Tonight?

359
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,517
- Wait, what time?
- How the fuck should I know?

360
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,615
National exposure for a show that's
not officially scheduled. Yes.

361
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,722
Do you think that network should
be allowed to televise this?

362
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,188
What do you think the most
respected show on television is?

363
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,527
Anything you're on, Mara.

364
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,452
Well, thank you. I agree.

365
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,429
In all seriousness, darling,
I think we agree, that it's Si<i>xt</i>y Minutes.

366
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:53,537
And what did they televise?
An assisted suicide by Dr. Kevorkian.

367
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,098
Where there's ratings,
there's a reason.

368
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,969
I approve of Si<i>xt</i>y Minutes doing this
and I don't approve of it here.

369
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,168
It's not a question whether
you approve or disapprove.

370
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,349
In this country we're allowed to
exorcise our individual freedoms...

371
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:09,120
even if it's in a way that all of
us would consider ill-advised.

372
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:15,549
<i>Hollywood, a dream for millions.</i>
<i>And nobody wanted that more than...</i>

373
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,764
<i>Jewel Jensen, from Santa Fe,</i>
<i>New Mexico.</i>

374
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,874
Ever since I was a little girl, I
always wanted to become an actress.

375
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,304
<i>I took tap and Jazz lessons,</i>
<i>and in high school...</i>

376
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,678
<i>I was captain of the cheerleading squad.</i>
Go panthers.

377
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,685
I pretty much went as far as
anyone could go in cheerleading.

378
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:44,091
Back at home, I was a kindergarten
aide, which I just loved.

379
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,293
But one day, I packed my little
beetle and decided to drive on out.

380
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,425
After being here about a week,
I got my first job.

381
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,535
It was at the Hollywood Star Tours.

382
00:22:55,307 --> 00:23:00,040
Just being so close to so many
famous people was amazing to me.

383
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,575
Just the one thing that was
wrong with the job...

384
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,216
I didn't have my days free
to go on auditions.

385
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,882
So, I took another job.

386
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,988
And this is something that
I never told anybody before.

387
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,534
I was sure I was going to be
discovered at the club.

388
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,929
You know Quentin Tarantino?
He goes to the gentlemers clubs.

389
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,867
<i>Sooner or later,</i>
<i>he had to come to mine.</i>

390
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,204
<i>If he would have seen me dance, he</i>
<i>would have called me.</i>

391
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,511
You get that one part,
you're on your way.

392
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:43,313
My parents still think
I'm a guide to Hollywood, so...

393
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,387
It's good. It's good, it's just,
there's a couple of things.

394
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:58,434
When you show her dancing, I saw
a glimpse of a nipple. Take it out.

395
00:23:58,503 --> 00:23:59,902
Yeah, she's a topless dancer.

396
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,868
They will kill me for that upstairs.

397
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,396
It's okay to have someone blow
a hole in their head...

398
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,834
but we can't see
a womars nipple. You're serious?

399
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:13,250
Basically. We're not in France.
There's one more thing.

400
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,779
What?

401
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:22,021
When she lied to her parents
about still being a tour guide.

402
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,760
Makes her less than pathetic.

403
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,455
Everyone lies to their parents, right?
That's the part of growing up.

404
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,501
I mean in the real world,
but not, not in ours.

405
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,506
You watched Olympic profiles, right?
Do you ever hear people say...

406
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,797
he may be a world
class snowboarder...

407
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,495
but unfortunately he's served time
for cocaine possession? Never.

408
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,710
Lying to your parents
isn't the same thing as...

409
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,386
I got you.
Look, you did a great job.

410
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,487
The dancer thing? Attracks every
male between 14 and 94. The hook?

411
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,819
Former small town cheerleader,
you know, trying to be a big star?

412
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:00,560
It's going to be huge. Huge.
Yeah, and I love her.

413
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,226
And America will love her.
Go to the ne<i>xt</i> one.

414
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,873
Sorry to interrupt, I'm so sorry.
I just cancelled a couple of shows.

415
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:09,766
What shows?

416
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,466
Yours for one.

417
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,105
You can't do that.

418
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:17,046
I can't cancel a show that ranks 90
or below every week?

419
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,777
This fucks up my whole season.

420
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,889
Pitch you my resignation letter?
Not yet pal. Not yet.

421
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,597
In 6 weeks, I will be graduating from
the university of California...

422
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,859
where, I had the time of my life.

423
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:41,898
No, for real, every single day just,
just living my life to the max.

424
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:47,104
And now that's all gonna be finished
soon, I gotta ask myself...

425
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:53,517
do I want to live the rest of my
life in some working as a slave.

426
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,617
And, nah, hell no, man.
Office hours?

427
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,389
This is my office.

428
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,433
<i>Brad Prince has never been</i>
<i>one to do anything half way.</i>

429
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:21,242
<i>At the age of nine, he was San</i>
<i>Diego's leading goal scorer.</i>

430
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:25,044
<i>And at 12, he was the city's</i>
<i>freestyle swimming champion.</i>

431
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,642
<i>And, when he grew older,</i>
<i>he turned to other pursuits.</i>

432
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,676
<i>I don't want to reach 40</i>
<i>and say...</i>

433
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,592
<i>"Look how many pages of meaningless</i>
<i>paper I pushed across my desk."</i>

434
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,260
You know, no way.

435
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:43,559
This is my lady.
This is Candy. Say hello.

436
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:44,591
Hi.

437
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,663
She's a little shy sometimes.

438
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,371
But I love you.

439
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,378
- You're with me on this, right baby?
- Absolutely.

440
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,377
Am I lucky, or what?

441
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:09,391
Obviously, I know there's a risk
involved in doing Live.

442
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:17,333
In taking that risk, I'm setting
myself up with what I want to do.

443
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,090
I want to climb the highest mountain
on every single continent.

444
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,099
I wanna check out
the forbidden city...

445
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,670
and dive the Great Barrier Reef...

446
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,804
and hit the hottest freak'n beaches
all over the world.

447
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:36,516
Cause to me, life is about
living and I wanna live.

448
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,918
Trevor right?

449
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,376
- You're the numbers guy?
- You got it.

450
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,886
For Live, what are our chances for
crossing the half hour mark?

451
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:49,993
A network hour is 42:26, so a half
is 21:13, you have, let's say...

452
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,630
a three-minute teaser, then you have
9 minutes for an intro, and a break.

453
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,165
Then you got three minutes of an
up-close, then you got another break.

454
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,166
Then you got, 16.66o<i>/</i>o chance
the first guy buying it.

455
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,362
- The bottom line?
- Over an 80o<i>/</i>o chance.

456
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,041
Okay, that's all I need. Cool.

457
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:07,209
What if it only goes a half hour?
There's a chance that someone...

458
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,515
The show can't.
It won't.

459
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,287
And even if it does, we will have
the most unbelievable clip.

460
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,859
One tiny piece of tape is won'th
a mint if it's the right tape.

461
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:22,931
Since we got together last time,
there's lots of information out there.

462
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,701
And frankly,
a lot of misinformation.

463
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:34,635
And what I'd like to do today is
separate the truth from the lies.

464
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:43,078
There are people who will say our
show is beneath the belly of a snake...

465
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,214
a freak show, un-American.

466
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,756
I'm here to assure you
that is none of those things.

467
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:59,392
Please allow me to play for you
a segment on one of our contestants.

468
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,800
And in after seeing it, you feel it's
unwon'thy of your commercials...

469
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:11,613
then don't buy the advertising and
you will be able to forget it.

470
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,187
<i>This is the best soil</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

471
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,720
and no one is prouder to farm
this land, than me.

472
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,564
My great grandfather came to
this country from Sweden...

473
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,632
to make this farm and prairie.

474
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,399
Life was e<i>xt</i>remely tough back then,
but he believed...

475
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,504
that America was the
land of opportunity.

476
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,183
<i>He worked this land and he made</i>
<i>it the finest farm in the area.</i>

477
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,114
We had a few bad weather years.

478
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,286
Harvest was less than it should
have been...

479
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:05,059
and, I'm ashamed to say it now, but,
the credit this farm once had, is gone.

480
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:11,072
And more than anything,
I want to hold on to it.

481
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,710
Honey, come here.

482
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,573
Can I say something?

483
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:21,845
Yeah. Of course.

484
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,889
Everything my husband just said
is, of course, true.

485
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:31,155
I don't think he's capable
of not telling the truth.

486
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,090
But what he won't tell you is,
after years of trying...

487
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,296
I finally became pregnant.

488
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:46,169
Unfortunately, our little boy,
Ricky, was born prematurely.

489
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,074
Everyone thought he would die.

490
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,740
Everyone but us.

491
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,586
<i>He needed the specialized care out</i>
<i>HMO wouldn't pay for.</i>

492
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,384
We had to take out a loan against
this farm.

493
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,755
<i>Our baby required</i>
<i>three separate operations.</i>

494
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:06,228
<i>We just hope and pray that your little</i>
<i>sweetheart is gonna come out okay.</i>

495
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,198
And we had amazing doctors.

496
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,298
And we had our faith...

497
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,401
and most important of all,
Ricky was such a fighter.

498
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:26,578
And nothing was better than the day
he finally came home. I'm sorry.

499
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,811
Mommy, Daddy.

500
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,682
There he is right now.
Hey sweetie.

501
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,024
We did what we had to do.

502
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:46,667
But, just as all the medical bills hit,
we had the bad weather years.

503
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:54,340
So we have a mountain of bills, and
a farm we can't afford to hold on too.

504
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,578
We know this is crazy...

505
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:11,520
but this land, worked by my grandfather,
my great grandfather, my father.

506
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,464
I can't let them down.

507
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,097
Someday, Ricky here is gonna
want this farm too...

508
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,107
and I want it to be here for him.

509
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,759
Ladies and gentlemen...

510
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,836
this is what our show is about.
Let's all get behind Rick.

511
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,339
- Let's all do the right thing.
- That was an actor, right?

512
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:03,407
No, it wasrt. That is a real man.

513
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,277
Sure, anybody...

514
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,285
Yeah, I got to go.
I love you.

515
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,763
I hate to admit it, but nice
job with the advertisers.

516
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,457
Well, desperation is
a powerful motivator.

517
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,228
Without them, New York would have
pulled the plug. And that's a fact.

518
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,833
I'm heartbroken.
What'd you tell them?

519
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:33,874
I told them the show was never going
to clear the FCC. It's un-airable.

520
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,076
- I have something for you.
- I don't want any more bullshit.

521
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,078
No bullshit.
You know what that is?

522
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:47,220
I know it. Constitutional law by
Gunther and Sullivan. 12th edition.

523
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,417
15th, actually.

524
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:53,488
Whatever. Man, I practically
memorized this book in school.

525
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,796
Don't tell me you're gonna give it
all up and become a lawyer.

526
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:02,963
No, I was just reading through it
and it's got interesting stuff.

527
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,238
I didn't know you read anything
other than Nielson Ratings.

528
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,145
Hey, is this what I think it is?

529
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,112
I don't know.
What do you think it is?

530
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,217
Is this a ticket to Woodstock?
You were there?

531
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,020
My mom took me.

532
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,624
- So was my oldest step brother.
- No shit.

533
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:29,995
- He talked about it all the time.
- Well sure, it was unbelievable.

534
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,236
Yeah, him and his friends, they
were going to change the world.

535
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:39,499
You can make a very good
argument that his generation did.

536
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,341
There was war and misery and poverty,
but there was also a lot of freedom.

537
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:48,084
Freedom. Absolutely. Freedom.

538
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,179
- And that's what this is all about.
- I don't know. Don't go there.

539
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,150
- You know who's in that?
- Everybody.

540
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,619
Everybody who's anybody in the law.

541
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,357
Clarence Darrel. Louie Brandeis,
Thurgood Marshall.

542
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,162
There all in there and you know
what they all did?

543
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:08,198
- They fought the status quo.
- They didn't have the FCC.

544
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,571
Fuck the FCC. Sure they're
gonna try to stop us...

545
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,008
but, Don, I'm asking you.

546
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:19,077
Do you want to be one of the Nay sayers
or do you wanna push the envelope?

547
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:26,388
Do you want to be in the company
directory or here, in the 16th edition?

548
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:37,329
"Say no to immorality".
"Say no to immorality".

549
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:41,964
No it helps. Not hurts, helps.

550
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,201
No, there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

551
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,835
What do you think
the word means?

552
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,944
Are you kidding?

553
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,773
Okay, okay. Alright.

554
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,052
What's going on?

555
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,226
We have 50 screaming protesters
outside her building.

556
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,429
And every station in town
is running it. Everyone except us.

557
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,294
They just don't get it.

558
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,268
- Giving you a tough time.
- You have no idea.

559
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,870
Networks run on fear.

560
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,508
Fear of the public, fear of the
advertisers, fear of the FCC...

561
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,711
fear of absolutely everybody.

562
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,179
Funny, you wouldn't know
if from the way they act, right?

563
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,485
Okay, turn off the camera.
Let's go eat or something.

564
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,750
Well, I'm not hungry.

565
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,348
Seriously, come on. You know what,
give me the camera.

566
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,422
- No. He's not going to.
- Give me the camera.

567
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:48,332
- Yes, give me the camera, Jersey.
- We don't have the time to do this.

568
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,007
How old are you?

569
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,264
Come on.
Oh, wait, I can't ask you questions?

570
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,077
How old are you?

571
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,181
Twenty nine.

572
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,415
Where you from?

573
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,906
This is such a nice pool.
Do you ever use your pool?

574
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,949
Never. Answer the question.

575
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,588
Boston. Just outside of Boston.

576
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,157
Where did you go to college?

577
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:16,833
Yale.

578
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,734
- East coast snob.
- No way.

579
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,195
My father was a Boston cop.

580
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:24,766
Oh that explains the moral streak.

581
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,138
Okay, serious question.
Girlfriend?

582
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,807
No, wait. You get to pummel me,
but not the other way around?

583
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,284
No, wait, girlfriend or no?

584
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,517
- Not now.
- Recent tragedy?

585
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,888
- Recent break up.
- It happens to the best of us.

586
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,422
You know, I really like
having this camera.

587
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,989
I think maybe I should do a film
about you...

588
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,662
- and you should produce the show.
- No, no, thanks.

589
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:55,963
Really, no? Money, power,
it's all part of the deal.

590
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,601
It's not enough for me.

591
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,108
Not enough money and power?
Jeeze, how much do you want?

592
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,905
<i>I've been extremely lucky.</i>
<i>Money was never a problem.</i>

593
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:16,381
<i>I've had the chance to travel</i>
<i>frequently and best of all...</i>

594
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,522
<i>I received the love a child</i>
<i>could ever want.</i>

595
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,660
Ever since my parents began
to read to me...

596
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,595
I wanted to be a writer.

597
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,737
And I've already written
two novels.

598
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,969
And you want to know what
I have to show for them?

599
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:32,804
Rejection slips.

600
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,601
No one is interested
in what I have to say.

601
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,673
It's not like I have such a wealth of
experience and I can't exactly play...

602
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:47,977
the I was raised around crimes
and guns and poverty angle.

603
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,050
I went to Princeton.

604
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,756
Truly great writers have all
had truly great experiences.

605
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,831
<i>For instance, Walt Whitman was a</i>
<i>nurse during the Civil War.</i>

606
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,495
<i>John Le Carre was actually</i>
<i>a spy in East Germany.</i>

607
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,769
<i>And Mia Angelo, she was on the front</i>
<i>lines of the civil rights movement.</i>

608
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,776
My hero is Hemmingway.

609
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:10,641
When he was my age, he didn't hand
out in the upper peninsula of Michigan.

610
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:15,648
<i>He went to the Italian front in WWI</i>
<i>to be an ambulance driver.</i>

611
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,545
<i>I mean, this was the most powerful</i>
<i>time of his life...</i>

612
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,652
<i>and it ultimately lead to his first</i>
<i>great work, "A Farewell To Arms".</i>

613
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,457
And that's what this will do for me.

614
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,864
I'll finally be published...

615
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,196
and my career, as a writer,
will be launched.

616
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,834
<i>You know, my parents think</i>
<i>I'm crazy, of course.</i>

617
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:35,836
What's this?

618
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,199
Oh, this is the crew
from the television show.

619
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,903
Young man, we'd much rather
you were not here.

620
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,073
Well, this will only a few minutes
and then I promise we'll leave.

621
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,083
This isn't about time.
We prefer to be left alone.

622
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:54,918
My son made this insane choice,
but please, leave us out of it.

623
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,651
Sir, is there anything
you'd like to day?

624
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,183
No.

625
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,888
Yes. What troubles me is
we live in this country...

626
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,869
where, unless you're on television,
it somehow doesn't count.

627
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:10,005
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, when
people break their bones, I help them.

628
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:14,103
It's not glamorous. It doesn't make
the news, but it benefits society.

629
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:15,877
And no I got a son...

630
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,180
who think that thins life
isn't good enough.

631
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,285
For validation everyone has
to be on TV?

632
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,856
- Rex, this is a joke, right?
- Joke? What do you mean?

633
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,489
The kid is great.
But the parent stuff is too much.

634
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,054
Why?

635
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:41,522
The whole rant against the media,
no, cut it out, cut it all out.

636
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,131
That's what's unique about
the segment.

637
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,630
Rex, if you leave this,
we'll look like idiots.

638
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,272
Will we? What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking.

639
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,602
Everyone feels this way about
the media. Everyone.

640
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,915
No. People may say they hate it,
but they really love it.

641
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,587
- Byrors parents don't love it.
- Oh, please.

642
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,313
They don't.

643
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:03,987
This guy's so noble and humble.
If Dateline came to his hospital...

644
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,313
and wanted to do a profile on him,
he would do it in a second.

645
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,730
He would do whatever they wanted.

646
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,484
We're gonna be the best thing
that ever happened to their kid.

647
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,357
Unless he dies, right?
Unless he dies.

648
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,498
That's life.
We all die.

649
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,371
Your show could cost him
his life.

650
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,302
- Do you realize?
- Try our show.

651
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,273
- Our show?
- Oh yeah. Try our show.

652
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,182
Not me.
This is your baby.

653
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:31,187
If "Live!" succeeds, guess what,
it's gonna be everybody's baby.

654
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,155
Katy, look at this.

655
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,385
How great is that?

656
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,383
Unbelievable.

657
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:45,463
Yeah. Dylan here.

658
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,572
It's for you.

659
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,670
Katy here.

660
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,808
Hi, great. Okay.
Thank you.

661
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,535
New York.
In person, me.

662
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,884
The CEO and the CFO.

663
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,814
This is good.

664
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,192
Oh shit, or maybe not.

665
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,053
Alright, I gotta go.
Uh, I gotta go.

666
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:14,621
Can we come?

667
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,828
No. I'm sorry but
this one place, you're not coming.

668
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:21,999
I know that it's going to be hard
for you to get them to allow access.

669
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,066
I understand where you're coming from.
There's time and place for everything.

670
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,302
This is not the place for a camera.
Get my bag, get my stuff.

671
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,272
<i>The Supreme Court has held</i>
<i>on several occasions...</i>

672
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,274
<i>that if programming is</i>
<i>not obscene...</i>

673
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,139
<i>if defined by the standards of</i>
<i>the community...</i>

674
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,178
<i>then it must be permitted</i>
<i>to be broadcast.</i>

675
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:43,191
<i>Several polls indicate there will be</i>
<i>substantial audience for this program.</i>

676
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:47,146
<i>If this show offended the community</i>
<i>standards of decency...</i>

677
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,529
<i>this clearly would not be the case.</i>

678
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,857
<i>Further,</i>
<i>new polls indicate...</i>

679
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:56,238
<i>67% of the American public</i>
<i>favors televised executions.</i>

680
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,034
<i>And 21% would pay to watch them.</i>

681
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:04,006
<i>As Supreme Court Justice William</i>
<i>O'Douglas said so 50 years ago...</i>

682
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:08,746
<i>"a function of free speech under</i>
<i>our system is to invite dispute.</i>

683
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,412
<i>It may indeed best serve</i>
<i>it's high purpose...</i>

684
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:15,290
<i>but it creates dissatisfaction</i>
<i>or stirs people to anger."</i>

685
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,750
Douglas, one of the
court's greatest minds...

686
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,527
<i>acknowledged that free speech could,</i>
<i>often, be very challenging.</i>

687
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:27,832
<i>But free speech is the</i>
<i>cornerstone, of our Republic.</i>

688
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,670
<i>And that is why</i>
<i>we need to protect it.</i>

689
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,410
<i>That is why we must protect it.</i>

690
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:45,247
Oi.

691
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,483
- Can't stay away?
- You're lawyer killed today.

692
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,723
I just can't believe you're going to
New York without us. It's not right.

693
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,162
For you.
For me, it's fine.

694
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,591
But if you promise not to bring
it up, come in. Have glass of wine.

695
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:02,224
Look, you gotta help me.
The trick to making any great film...

696
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,731
is to find the place that's impossible
to get access and then get in.

697
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:09,037
- All I want is a chance to...
- I know what you want.

698
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,879
- You do?
- I do.

699
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,682
The trick for both of is, to get to

700
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:21,255
close to what's really going on.

701
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,294
What I do, what we all do...

702
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,763
is give an audience
what they want...

703
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,330
but we do it in a way that
can some how justify it.

704
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,233
God knows it isn't here.

705
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,543
Go to the Metropolitan museum of
art, look at the paintings.

706
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,314
What do you see?

707
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,418
One nude after the other.

708
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:54,690
Fantastic looking tits,
all over the place.

709
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:59,287
The sexiest girls in
wildly erotic situations.

710
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,064
And we look at it, and we get
to say, that's art.

711
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,832
Not, that's getting me hot.

712
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,867
And that fills your museum.

713
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,033
Not much different than putting
eyeballs in front of the tube.

714
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:19,079
So art, is only an excuse
to legitimize sex?

715
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,186
It's all about wish fulfillment.

716
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:31,089
Those rich jerks buy the art, they
don't give a shit about biblical allegory.

717
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:35,096
They wanted to fuck the amazing
girl lying naked in the woods.

718
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,003
Cut to two centuries later,
we're still selling the same thing.

719
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,634
What I got to do, is place the
audience not where they are...

720
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,503
but where they want to be.

721
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:50,176
Starring in a movie.

722
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:54,080
Advising the president,
recording a hit song.

723
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:02,526
We got you, baby. Your world
is confused with our world.

724
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:07,624
And we could do with you,
whatever we want.

725
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,457
Can I ask you one question?

726
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,362
One.

727
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:18,036
- What is it you really want?
- Forty share.

728
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,172
No, for real.

729
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:35,487
I don't want to end up a three
paragraph obituary in the Times.

730
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:41,394
She had a network she had some
shows, she died.

731
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:50,464
I want to push the medium,
reinvent it.

732
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,132
So, in the end, people know
I was here.

733
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,173
More than anything, I don't
want to be ordinary.

734
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,839
Are you mad at me?

735
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,818
Not at all.

736
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:13,360
Thank you.

737
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,131
Thanks so much.

738
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,824
Long way from Southwest.

739
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,927
I know.
Don't get too used to it.

740
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,063
Gotta lot of work to do.
Am I gonna love these?

741
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,139
Yeah, I hope so.

742
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,375
Listen to me. In this world,
it's tough to be Mexican.

743
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,242
It's tough to be poor,
and it's tough to be gay.

744
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,313
Try being all three.
It's very hard.

745
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:42,384
He used to be a little girl,
now he's got huervos.

746
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,082
Like I say,
with friends like these-

747
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,394
Someone's sissy.

748
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,020
They may be cool now, but over
there in the school yard...

749
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,027
that's where the same guys
used to beat me up.

750
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,435
It's not the best place in America
to grow up gay.

751
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,205
But I always knew in my heart.

752
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,703
One thing, and that was that
someday, I was getting out.

753
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,174
This is my mamma.

754
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,120
My mamma,
she always worked hard.

755
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,277
When me and my sister
were kids...

756
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,090
no only did she sew every day at the
factory, but she was always there for us.

757
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,357
With breakfast, dinner.

758
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,864
Making sure we went to school,
did our homework...

759
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,330
went to music and dance class.

760
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,428
Oh, of course, Papa.
Papa's a gardener.

761
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,373
You know, one of those guys with
the leaf blowers on his back.

762
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:32,691
You know,
people are thinking...

763
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,644
"who's this pain in the neck guy
making all this horrible noise?"

764
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,371
Pablo.

765
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,712
Sorry mamma,
people thought it.

766
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,350
Me, I saw him as a man who
worked ten hours a day.

767
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,987
He would come home, have dinner, and
then go do work at the gas station.

768
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,860
All for me and my sisters.

769
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,221
One of my sisters is now
a dancer on Broadway...

770
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:58,258
my other's a secretary, and I was the
one everyone had the greatest hopes for.

771
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,364
And see this lady?
Rita Haywon'th.

772
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:10,829
You know that wasrt her real name
It was Margarita Carmen Cancino.

773
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,338
And she was the greatest dancer
of the thirties.

774
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:18,047
And I wanted to be just like her.
It's kinda embarrassing, I know.

775
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:23,676
But that was going to be my
ticket out of there. And I was good.

776
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:26,629
Me and my sister won a bunch
of contests and everything.

777
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,361
And a little after my 17th birthday,
I was coming out of a party...

778
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,461
and three huge guys jumped me.

779
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,073
They smashed my knee with
a tire iron, blew it out completely.

780
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,439
My only crime, being gay.

781
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:46,872
And I could not dance any more.
It was the end of my world.

782
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:52,512
I tried. It's so, so hard to come
back and I did, for a month...

783
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,820
and then I blew it out again
and that was that.

784
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:07,002
Two month later my papa died
and I was nowhere.

785
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,265
I felt like dying.

786
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,039
Sorry.

787
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:23,015
My mamma always says that this
is the greatest country in the world.

788
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,948
And no matter how bad things get,
the surs gonna shine someday.

789
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,720
All my life, I've lived
in the that.

790
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:37,460
All my life, my mamma has worked
11, 12 hours a day.

791
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:43,337
I go on the show and in five minutes
I can take us both out of that. Forever.

792
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,144
Not bad.

793
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,753
- But?
- But you're missing one big thing.

794
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:58,215
Which is what?

795
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,516
A mariachi band.

796
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,621
A mariachi band?

797
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:06,753
Absolutely. Doesrt this kid go
anywhere they have mariachi bands?

798
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,093
That's the biggest clich' ever.

799
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:13,130
Well, maybe for you, but,
this is our riskiest piece.

800
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,231
The kid's great. He's good looking,
he's got a mamma he loves.

801
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,490
American will love.
That's the good news.

802
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:22,774
The bad news is he's a homo.
Many are gonna hate him for that.

803
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,238
So give that crowd what they like.
A mariachi band.

804
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,181
A mariachi band.

805
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:32,484
You give me my Mariachi's and the
rest of the piece stays as is. Ne<i>xt.</i>

806
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,349
<i>Abalone is one of the worlds</i>
<i>top super models.</i>

807
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,918
<i>Her face is on the covers</i>
<i>of countless magazines.</i>

808
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,395
<i>I was living a fantasy.</i>

809
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:47,267
<i>I was making thousands of dollars</i>
<i>a day hanging out with movie stars.</i>

810
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,637
It was life straight
out of my dreams...

811
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:55,107
and straight out of the dreams
of girls across America.

812
00:51:55,178 --> 00:52:01,310
That was the problem. I finally saw
what complete garbage it was...

813
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,784
and what a tiny pawn I was in their
exploitative game.

814
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:10,151
<i>For over fifteen years my life is</i>
<i>about one thing. Objectifying my body.</i>

815
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:16,699
So at the Paris spring shows before
I was about to walk out on the runway...

816
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:23,235
and I turn around and walk out the tent
and I never turned back.

817
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:25,370
And that was it.

818
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:32,613
<i>And now, Abalone has reinvented</i>
<i>herself as a performance artist</i>

819
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:36,106
<i>This piece involves living in a cage</i>
<i>for an entire month...</i>

820
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,986
<i>in order to empathize with</i>
<i>the animals living in the zoo.</i>

821
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,080
Yes, I still use my body to
make my living...

822
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:47,757
but now it's about art.

823
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:55,267
This is how you do an art piece
and raise money at the same time.

824
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:01,605
Now I know there are lots of you
out there who just love to lick...

825
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:07,041
and all though you think all those
licks you take in life are for free...

826
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,177
I'm here to tell you that they aren't.

827
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,555
You pay for them in heart,
in joy, in degradation.

828
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:17,916
Well, tonight you're going to pay
for them in greenbacks.

829
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:24,465
For the white, 50 a lick and for the
red 100...

830
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:31,803
and for the blue just 3 notes
but well won'th it.

831
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,073
So, who's first?

832
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:51,187
Ladies and gentleman we raised
over 22,000 dollars.

833
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,161
Very good.

834
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,996
Let me tell you this piece is nothing
compared to my ne<i>xt</i> work.

835
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:06,168
It will be the ultimate art piece...

836
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:10,735
when other performers step on
stage they risk very little.

837
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:14,241
Maybe some bad reviews,
a bruised ego...

838
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:21,155
but for this ne<i>xt</i> piece I will be
risking it all. Everything.

839
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,687
Art will never be the same.

840
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:32,065
Jersey, get the hardest man
in show business.

841
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,362
Look at him.

842
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:42,741
Look, Jersey, monitor monitor.
Rex, wake up, wake up.

843
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,308
<i>Thanks Jim.</i>
<i>I'm here with Don Helman.</i>

844
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,148
<i>The attorney who won</i>
<i>this crucial case.</i>

845
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,820
A big win for ABN, Don.
Were you surprised?

846
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,446
Well, not at all. It's not really a
victory for me or even ABN.

847
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,891
It's a victory for free speech.

848
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,722
I have enormous respect for the
FCC and the courage they showed.

849
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,355
Tough, but an important decision.

850
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:06,361
It should also be pointed out that
a critical component of this decision.

851
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:10,396
The FCC insisted that the program be
aired at one am eastern time...

852
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,805
when it's presumed that
few children will be watching.

853
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,135
It was the right thing to do.

854
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:21,646
I knew it.

855
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:25,450
That's awesome.

856
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:26,822
Spectacular.

857
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,860
Would you like a bagel?
We're landing any minute, sleepy head.

858
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,296
Katy here.

859
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,040
Yeah. No, no problem at all.

860
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:50,573
Thank you.

861
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,141
Bastards.

862
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:58,618
They pushed my meeting 45 minutes.

863
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,887
That doesn't sound so bad.

864
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:06,415
They pushed me without e<i>xt</i>ending
my time. So, I have 15 minutes.

865
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,327
The shows history.

866
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,200
I was so close.

867
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:22,701
My career may be toast but you,
you are getting a present.

868
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:28,008
The button cam is really sensitive.

869
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,952
So stay as still as you can.
Are you ready?

870
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,375
Yeah. Work?

871
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,859
Yeah, looks great.

872
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,484
- You sure you want to do this?
- Absolutely.

873
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:41,828
Mr. Wilkins.

874
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,315
Mr. Mayor.

875
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,563
Hello. Nice work with the FCC.

876
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,466
Oh it was a terrific
piece of lawyering.

877
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:48,333
Evidently.

878
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,893
Well, it removed a problem but
certainly not our biggest problem...

879
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,503
which is the shit
for brains congressman...

880
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:58,174
who are gonna be on our asses
if we air this show. It's not won'th it.

881
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:02,477
Maybe not but maybe it is.
You've seen the projected numbers.

882
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,983
We're estimating near
super bowl ratings...

883
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:09,385
and commercials selling at over
2.6 million per thirty seconds.

884
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:15,998
The money's excellent, but right
now the minuses far out way the pluses.

885
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,994
We still have a reputation.

886
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,593
We can't just piss that away
for one television show.

887
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,532
That's the bottom line.

888
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,103
If I may, let me tell you the
bottom line as I see it.

889
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,906
15 years ago the networks controlled
75o<i>/</i>o of the audience.

890
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,709
10 years ago it was 40o<i>/</i>o.

891
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:40,715
This year, if we're lucky
it'll be 20o<i>/</i>o.

892
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,053
As bad as those numbers are...

893
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:46,729
when you look at the demo
of kids below them it's even worse.

894
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:49,891
We are in a word, dying.

895
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,392
How did the show test with kids?

896
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:55,336
Through the roof.

897
00:57:55,705 --> 00:58:00,972
I like the idea of appealing
to kids. We do need that.

898
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,637
Well, if you want to win them back,
here's your chance.

899
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:07,015
If we target kids, they're
gonna tear us a new one.

900
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:12,421
The FCC has done our work for us
already by making us air it so late...

901
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:15,289
which is also unbelievably
cheap air time.

902
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,485
By tonight every kid in America
will know the one thing...

903
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,430
they are forbidden to do is stay
up late and watch our show.

904
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,556
Will they? I think they
all know the answer to that.

905
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:30,057
So, you're telling us that this will
get us back in the kids game?

906
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:30,937
Guaranteed.

907
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:32,741
Oh, this is risky.

908
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,875
If kids watch it,
in any numbers...

909
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,806
shit-eating congressman
are going to have our asses.

910
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,616
Let me tell you the little I
know about congressman.

911
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,482
What do they care about most?
Money.

912
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:48,615
And this show will make us an
enormous amount of revenue<i>...</i>

913
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:55,389
That we could donate to those
same congressman.

914
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,291
And what are they going to
do with all that money?

915
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:03,667
They're gonna turn it around and
buy commercials from us.

916
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:08,671
T's a double dip.
It's legal and it's wonderful.

917
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,879
Screw em.
It was fun while it lasted.

918
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:31,822
Welcome home boss.

919
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:33,328
The show.

920
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,701
Green light!

921
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:45,603
<i>Sunday night five dreams fulfilled</i>
<i>beyond their wildest expectations.</i>

922
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:50,616
<i>One dashed forever.</i>
<i>Only on ABN.</i>

923
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:55,122
<i>The world will be watching,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

924
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,382
I will. That's great.

925
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,673
Who are you pulling for?

926
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,210
Brad, he's the man.

927
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,446
Rick, he stands for what's
decent in America.

928
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,472
Abalone, definitely.

929
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:26,045
Jewel.

930
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,557
Rick, just because.

931
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,510
All of a sudden lots of people
are embracing "Live!".

932
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,325
And instead of asking why,
people are asking why not?

933
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,823
It may be unusual, it may be
bloody, but if you ask me...

934
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:42,667
it's exciting and if this is history,
you can count this reporter in.

935
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,466
Who're you rooting for?

936
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,062
Rick, hell I feel like sending
that guy a donation.

937
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,806
Oh, Pablo. He's so cute.

938
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,511
I would have to say oyster,
she I like.

939
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,886
Byron. You know that man.
He's got everything man.

940
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,242
He's got heart, he's smart.
You know what time it is man.

941
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:06,888
Everyone in our culture is rooting
for Abalone. She's great, awesome.

942
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:07,819
Byron.

943
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,791
- You ma'am?
- It's disgusting. Nobody.

944
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,567
- You're not watching?
- Well, I didn't say that?

945
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:57,333
I'm a lot nervous. But I know,
deep down in my heart...

946
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,509
that it's the right thing to do if
I'm gonna make it as an actress.

947
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,434
Life is great.

948
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,377
All right folks, here we go.
Everybody stand by.

949
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,842
Four, give me the audience.
Two, give me the host.

950
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:14,743
Stand by Peter Pan,
this is gonna be great.

951
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:19,080
In ten, nine, eight, two
start your move.

952
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:22,258
Seven, six, five seconds
here we go.

953
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:25,494
Four, three, two, one.

954
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,163
We are live, announce.

955
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,405
<i>Welcome to the television program</i>
<i>of the century...</i>

956

<i>One of America's</i>

<i>Buck Conrad.</i>

961
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,885
What a night, America.

962
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,562
And up on two.

963
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,790
Thank you for making us part
of your plans.

964
01:03:56,332 --> 01:04:00,098
"Live!" is a television show unlike
any other...

965
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,668
based on the classic game
of Russian Roulette.

966
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:08,440
<i>Each of our contestants will put</i>
<i>a loaded revolver to their heads...</i>

967
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:14,081
<i>and pull the trigger risking</i>
<i>it all for five million dollars.</i>

968
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:18,148
It's history, it's real and it's live.

969
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,453
<i>Without further ado,</i>
I'd like to introduce a gentleman...

970
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,132
<i>who will be of utmost importance</i>
<i>in tonight's entertainment.</i>

971
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,134
Tonight's show,
not entertainment.

972
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,195
This jerks make 300,000 dollars
for a nights work...

973
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:38,933
and he can't read the teleprompter?

974
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:43,844
Mr. Harry Feedler from the National
Gun Association. Welcome sir.

975
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:44,911
Get us in tight.

976
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,048
Give me three, tight.

977
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,913
This ladies and gentleman is
a.357 revolver.

978
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:55,851
One of the finest hand guns made
in America today. How about it?

979
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,661
Without this, there is no show.

980
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,229
Fade up on three, music.

981
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:10,862
Let's meet our contestants.

982
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:16,637
Up first from San Francisco, Ca.
Give it up for Abalone.

983
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:26,617
From America's heartland,
Minnesota, Rick.

984
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:35,326

Let's here it for Brad.

985

From Hoboken, New Jersey.
Give it up for Byron.

986
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:49,408
From Los Angeles, California.
We have Pablo.

987
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:56,136
Last but not least, from Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

988
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,712
The lovely and talented, Jewel.

989
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:03,521
Arert they the greatest?

990
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,459
These six people are some of the
finest folks you'll ever meet.

991
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:12,623
Drawn across this great country of
ours and before this evening is over...

992
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,954
Eight, eight.

993
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,167
We'll get to know all these wonderful
folks a whole lot better.

994
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,508
These ladies and gentlemen
are checks.

995
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:27,114
Checks made out for five million dollars
but the names are not there. Why?

996
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:33,648
Because only 5 of these heroes
will take them home. And who will it be?

997
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,679
<i>Abalone, you're gonna do it.</i>

998
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:37,488
<i>You go Byron.</i>

999
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,049
<i>I love you Jewel.</i>

1000
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:40,892
<i>Go Abalone.</i>

1001
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:56,844
Ready seven.
Camera seven. Loading.

1002
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:00,142
For every gun there must be a bullet.

1003
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:09,721
Thank you Krista.

1004
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,193
Our silver bullet.

1005
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:24,497
And to assure our contestants have
no idea where our silver bullet is...

1006
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:28,604
all the other chambers in the hand
gun are being filled with dummy rounds.

1007
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,216
And now, the moment
you've been waiting for.

1008
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,918
The spin of fate.

1009
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,860
<i>And who will be our very first to go.</i>

1010
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:55,094
<i>Each ball here holds the name of</i>
<i>one of our contestants. Krista.</i>

1011
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:07,616
And who will our very
first contestant be?

1012
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:15,056
Our very first and e<i>xt</i>remely
special contestant will be...

1013
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,722
Jewel.

1014
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,335
Good first, good first.

1015
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,341
Before our lovely Jewel takes
that fateful pull...

1016
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:39,014
let's meet Miss Jewel Jenson
from Santa Fe, New Mexico.

1017
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:44,312
<i>Hollywood, it's a dream for millions.</i>
<i>And nobody wanted that more than...</i>

1018
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,517
<i>Jewel Jensen, from Santa Fe,</i>
<i>New Mexico.</i>

1019
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:53,261
First numbers.

1020
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,130
Nineteen share, respectable.

1021
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,330
Respectable?

1022
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,365
We're gonna need a lot more
than respectable.

1023
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,638
My mother's respectable.

1024
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:10,941
<i>Soon. Oh yeah. All my life</i>
<i>I wanted to be a famous actress...</i>

1025
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:16,177
<i>and I'm gonna have as many people</i>
<i>watching me as Michelle Pfeifer.</i>

1026
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:19,821
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

1027
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:24,923
Let's all give a big big round of
applause for a very talented lady.

1028
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,694
Are you ready?

1029
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,099
You bet. Yeah.

1030
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:37,936
Then let's begin. The gun please.

1031
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,850
Please step inside the barrel.

1032
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,769
Ready, five.

1033
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:23,711
Tighter on Jewel.

1034
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,368
God, Oh! My God!

1035
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:54,373
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1036
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,917
Oh my God! Thank you.
Thank you, so much. Oh my God.

1037
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,455
That was awesome.
What a rush.

1038
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,428
We have a show.
We got ourselves a show.

1039
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:12,926
Thank you.

1040
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,438
Stand by for commercial.
Queue announce.

1041
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:21,772
<i>We'll be right back with another</i>

1042
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,478
25 share and moving up.

1043
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,451
Krista, will you?

1044
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:33,979
Thank you darling.

1045
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:40,752
Our very ne<i>xt</i>, but just as special...

1046
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,331
contestant will be Pablo.

1047
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:58,244
Let's meet Mr. Pablo Rodriguez,
up-close and personal.

1048
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,243
<i>Let me tell you something. In this</i>
<i>world, it's tough to be Mexican.</i>

1049
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:07,615
<i>It's tough to be poor, and it's</i>
<i>tough to be gay. Try being all three.</i>

1050
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,420
<i>Yo, what's up homey, you got it, dog.</i>

1051
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,790
<i>He used to be a little girl,</i>
<i>now he's got huervos.</i>

1052
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:19,463
<i>All my life, my mamma has worked</i>
<i>11, 12 hours a day.</i>

1053
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:25,195
<i>I go on the show and in 5 minutes</i>
<i>I can take us out of the misery.</i>

1054
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:31,342
<i>Pablo! Yes, sir!</i>

1055
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,023
<i>Bye!</i>

1056
01:12:56,105 --> 01:13:02,635
Ladies and gentlemen, America,
I give you Mr. Pablo Rodriguez.

1057
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,917
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

1058
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,923
Any last thoughts
you'd like to share?

1059
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:38,640
I just want to say that you were
the best mom and I love you.

1060
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:42,706
The gun please.

1061
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,922
Step inside the barrel, please.

1062
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,813
Oh, God. Come on, Pablo.

1063
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,801
Yes. Yes!

1064
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,377
Mamma, we did it.
Come here, man.

1065
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:24,077
Camera 1, give me a close up of
the mom. Camera 7, the college kids.

1066
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,247
There's never been a show
like this. Ever.

1067
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:34,318
Yeah? 32 share.
Kicking ass. We're kicking ass.

1068
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,032
We're down to four contestants
and one silver bullet.

1069
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:43,871
Krista, will you?
Thank you, sweetheart.

1070
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:47,771
And ne<i>xt</i> in the barrel is...

1071
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:50,241
Abalone.

1072
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,083
Stand by commercial
and queue now.

1073
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:04,319
<i>We'll be right back with more</i>
<i>of America's favorite, "Live!".</i>

1074
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,954
Yeah. Rocking. We are rocking.
41 share.

1075
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:10,952
Really? Oh my God.

1076
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:17,997
<i>I will be risking it all.</i>
<i>Art will never be the same.</i>

1077
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:19,230
Abalone.

1078
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,607
- Are you ready?
- E<i>xt</i>remely.

1079
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,975
Then let's begin.
The gun please.

1080
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:43,530
Thank you, America. For giving me
this chance to come before you.

1081
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:49,026
I'd like to dedicate this performance
to all the vestal virgins and women...

1082
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:51,301
sacrifice victims throughout history.

1083
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,432
Whether in Mayan, Greek,
or Roman Culture...

1084
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,407
men have always persued their
horrible desires for redemption...

1085
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:02,983
by somehow believing they can become
purified if they kill the dirty woman.

1086
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,277
What's she talking about?

1087
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,719
No idea. But she's hot.

1088
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:10,519
Women have been sacrificed
for thousands of years...

1089
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,192
told that their lot in life
was to die...

1090
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,650
so that men could pacify the Gods.

1091
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:16,380
That's right!

1092
01:17:16,398 --> 01:17:20,164
And for all those years, women
were never given a choice.

1093
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:25,799
But this woman was,
and I cast my loss with them.

1094
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,738
What the fuck? Somebody.

1095
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:40,786
Sweet empowerment.
Should I kill myself, or you?

1096
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,210
What do we do?

1097
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:42,883
She's gonna shoot him.

1098
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,882
Rex, you hung out with her,
what's she gonna do?

1099
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,986
What a feeling.

1100
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:52,050
Wait, she's a performance artist,
so let's hang tight.

1101
01:17:52,067 --> 01:17:59,974
And now men, what we women
have felt, for all these years.

1102
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:01,939
She's gonna do it.

1103
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:02,567
Holy shit.

1104
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,875
In the name of all women
sacrifice victims...

1105
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:11,643
of centuries past, and
centuries to come, I do this for you.

1106
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:20,824
Are you okay?

1107
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,021
Yes!

1108
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,476
This is yours.

1109
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,129
We'll be right back,
with more "Live!".

1110
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,824
What a fucking nut.
What a nutcase.

1111
01:19:07,175 --> 01:19:09,075
We are defiantly live here.

1112
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:10,634
Krista.

1113
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,247
Thank you.

1114
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:22,247
Up ne<i>xt</i>, New Jersey's finest, Byron.

1115
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,365
Let's meet Byron.

1116
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,804
<i>Five, camera one</i>
Yeah.

1117
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:39,170
Thank you.

1118
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,366
44 share.

1119
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,875
It's incredible.

1120
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:44,805
<i>Give me Byron.</i>

1121
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,303
Stratosphere, here we come.

1122
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,742
<i>Deep down inside in</i>
<i>my heart of hearts...</i>

1123
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:53,720
<i>I believe there are no substitutes</i>
<i>for real life experiences.</i>

1124
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,180
<i>That's what this show</i>
<i>will do for me.</i>

1125
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:01,324
<i>I'll finally be published and my</i>
<i>career as a writer will be launched.</i>

1126
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:03,421
Byron Boyd.

1127
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:15,431
Are you ready sir?

1128
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:19,973
I am.

1129
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,646
Then let's begin.

1130
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,292
Step inside the barrel, please.

1131
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:10,921
Be brave, Byron!

1132
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:43,923
Oh my God, I did it.

1133
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:45,759
I did it.

1134
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:47,725
Oh, my God.

1135
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,904
This is everything
I thought it would be. Oh my God.

1136
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:05,049
Congratulations, Byron.
Five million dollars.

1137
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:08,880
- Thank you so much.
- You're very welcome. Great job.

1138
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:13,458
Mom and Dad, I did it.

1139
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:16,027
And we'll be right back
with more "Live!".

1140
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:28,007
50 share? 50 share.

1141
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,374
Half the homes in America
are watching.

1142
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:35,849
50 share feels good.

1143
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:37,882
Music.

1144
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,648
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're welcome.

1145
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:52,158

Let's meet Mr. Brad Prince.

1148

<i>In six weeks, I will be graduating</i>

1149
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,248

59 share.

1152
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,025
Defy the final Seinfeld.

1153
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:31,870
Ratings defy just about
every Super Bowl.

1154
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,700
Part of history.

1155
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:39,540
<i>My life is gonna be about endless</i>
<i>days of great waves and boards...</i>

1156
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,644
<i>and nights to remember with my lady.</i>

1157
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:49,882
Let's all give a big round of
applause for one incredible guy.

1158
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:55,161
You ready, sir?

1159
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,031
Absolutely, I'm ready.

1160
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,282
Please, step inside the barrel.

1161
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,228
Man.

1162
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:36,869
Take nine.

1163
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,020
After this, baby, surfing forever.

1164
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:20,578
Cameras five, six, seven and eight.
Audience shots. Music.

1165
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:25,047
Keep shooting.
We're live, we need these shots.

1166
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,126
We're clear?

1167
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,991
Hey look, hey look, look, Rick.

1168
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:44,597
Two, give me Rick. Music.

1169
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,788
And this sir, is yours.

1170
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,187
What do you have
to say about that?

1171
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,359
Contestants, come on up.

1172
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,931
Thank you America, and good night.

1173
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:31,409
<i>This has been a presentation of ABN,</i>
<i>America's favorite network.</i>

1174
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:33,483
<i>Thank you forjoining us.</i>

1175
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,083
Roll the crawl.

1176
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,826
That was amazing.
That was amazing.

1177
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,501
Where's Katy? Where is she?

1178
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:53,305
Inside.

1179
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:07,852
You okay? You okay?

1180
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:17,529
That kid had his whole life
ahead of him.

1181
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,892
He's dead.
And for what?

1182
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:24,161
Oh, God.

1183
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:29,909
You didn't pull the trigger.
He did. Right?

1184
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:33,072
I wish is was that easy.
It's not.

1185
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,174
Katy, it was the show.

1186
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:40,680
His choice, no one forced
him to do it.

1187
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:44,021
I handed him the gun.
I handed him the gun.

1188
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:51,194
Oh, Katy, no. He took the gun.

1189
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:53,725
He made the call.

1190
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:06,747
Katy, you did it. You did it.
People watched in unbelievable numbers.

1191
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:11,512
A show unlike any other, ever.

1192
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,289
They did, didn't they?

1193
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,537
Get out of this.

1194
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:35,968
Walk away.
- I can't. I can't.

1195
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:40,673
- Why not?
- There's a future.

1196
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:13,978
Are you happy with the way
things turned out, Katy? Over here.

1197
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,776
Katy, will you shoot
a whole family ne<i>xt</i> time?

1198
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,525
Katy! Dylan.

1199
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:32,551
Katy?
Hang in there sweetie.

1200
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:33,750
Call nine one one.

1201
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:35,201
Call an ambulance right now.

1202
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:38,835
It's gonna be alright.

1203
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:47,765
Just have a short statement.
At four ten this morning...

1204
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:50,751
Katy Courbet, president of
programming for ABN died.

1205
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,783
Our heartfelt condolences go out
to her family and friends.

1206
01:29:57,291 --> 01:30:00,317
She was a giant in this industry
and will be surely missed.

1207
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,160
Anything on the kid who did it?

1208
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:06,083
You'll have to check with the LAPD,
but as far as we've been informed...

1209
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,727
there is, as yet,
no motive for the shooting.

1210
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:10,470
What was it about the show
that made him want to do this?

1211
01:30:10,905 --> 01:30:12,930
We're convinced, the show
Katy produced...

1212
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,909
and this senseless act of violence
are not linked in any way.

1213
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:19,896
All of us lost a wonderful
and talented colleague...

1214
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:28,686
and an e<i>xt</i>remely close friend and
that's where our thought should be.

1215
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:35,494
<i>Welcome, to the television</i>
<i>program of the century...</i>

1216
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,188
<i>where the stakes are unmatched anywhere.</i>

1217
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:39,962
Oh, my God.

1218
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:44,895
<i>And now, our host for the evening.</i>

1219
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:49,940
<i>One of America's best loved</i>
<i>actresses. Jewel Jensen.</i>

1220
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:51,805
As Katy predicted...

1221
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:56,743
"Live!" became the most successful
program ever aired on American TV.

1222
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:58,571
Television show, "Live!".

1223
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,281
And it's now an annual special.

1224
01:31:01,155 --> 01:31:04,886
Katy's obituary took an entire
page in the New York Times.

1225
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:08,391
She was remembered as
a trailblazer and a visionary.

1226
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:11,794
And in the spirit of full disclosure,
I should say that now...

1227
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,660
I, too, work for the network.

1228
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:16,534
Let's give it up for Katherine.

1229
01:31:18,673 --> 01:31:22,131
And last, but not least, Rodger!
