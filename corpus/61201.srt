your puzzle box. Patience.

704
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,407
Okay, there are no windows.

705
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,505
We just came in
through the only doorway.

706
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,243
That leaves one explanation .

707
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,080
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy"

708
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,312
how the zombie king got away

709
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,218
when l chased him
into the pharaoh's tomb?

710
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,019
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.

711
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,458
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.

712
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,553
Help me lift some stuff up.

713
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,466
Roy!

714
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,911
The painting .
lt's looking at me.

715
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,243
-Look!
-Oh , yeah .

716
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,409
Looks like it's looking at me.
That's great.

717
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,645
No, real eyes.
Moving !

718
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,086
That kid got to you ,
didn't he?

719
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,420
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.

720
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,550
That's a technique
that an artist uses.

721
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,619
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term .

722
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,689
lt's unnerving , though .
l'll give you that.

723
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,740
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!

724
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,241
Whatever you say, Chon .

725
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,179
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.

726
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,750
Roy!

727
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,118
What, Chon?
Are the statues moving now?

728
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,693
Wow.

729
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,232
Mm-mmm !

730
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:37,863
Roy!

731
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,800
l can't hear myself think
with you shouting at me.

732
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,099
Chon?

733
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,340
Chon? Chon?

734
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,910
This is ridiculous.

735
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,611
lf you want to act
like a child and play games. . .

736
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,152
then find someone else. . .

737
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,619
'cause l take
this stuff seriously.

738
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,486
l'm here to work.
l'm on a mission .

739
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,485
Chon?

740
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,357
Okay, Chon .

741
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,491
Okay, you little
Chinese otter.

742
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,898
Let's play.

743
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,195
Ha!

744
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,743
Chon , demons!

745
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,504
She's gonna fight
my battles for me.

746
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,304
Come on .
Let's go.

747
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,969
What? What are you doing?

748
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,607
lt's kinky.
l like it.

749
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,150
Wow! Look at this.

750
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,053
Wait. There's something
different about this room .

751
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,401
Hey.
