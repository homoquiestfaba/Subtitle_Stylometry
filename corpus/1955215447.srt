1
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,010
He's gone.

2
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,823
Lyndon.

3
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,658
<i>Lyndon.</i>

4
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,327
<i>Wake up, honey.</i>

5
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,330
<i>We're about to land</i>
<i>in Washington.</i>

6
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,866
Okay.

7
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,773
Did you hear
from Bobby?

8
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:24,042
Man: <i>He'll be waiting</i>
<i>on the tarmac.</i>

9
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:27,246
There will be
reporters there, too.

10
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,214
You'll be expected to make
a statement, something short.

11
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,116
- Thank you.
- I wanna reach out to the leadership

12
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,918
as soon as we hit
the ground.

13
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,754
I wanna talk to each
and every one of them.

14
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,457
You call Rose Kennedy?

15
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,958
I did.

16
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,062
My Lord, what that woman
has been through.

17
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,465
Your lipstick.

18
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,400
- What?
- Fix your lipstick.

19
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,569
Oh.

20
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,906
How did John Connally's
surgery go?

21
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,742
Doctor said optimistic.

22
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,277
Ah.

23
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,412
Thank God for that.

24
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,983
Jackie?

25
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,252
She won't change
her clothes.

26
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:14,226
<i>Says she wants them to see</i>
<i>what they have done to Jack.</i>

27
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,129
You see the way
she stared at me

28
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,797
before I took the oath?

29
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:23,569
- She's upset, honey.
- We're all upset, Bird!

30
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,274
We're all upset.

31
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:33,679
<i>Walter,</i>

32
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,082
a televised address
to both houses of Congress...

33
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:41,620
as soon
as it seems decent.

34
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,631
Where were you just now,

35
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,334
<i>Mr. President?</i>

36
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,937
Accidental President.

37
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,507
That's what they'll say.

38
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,246
Well,

39
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:18,183
we'll have to change that
next November.

40
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,442
Johnson:
<i>I keep having this dream.</i>

41
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:47,846
<i>I'm back in the Hill Country</i>
<i>in the old days,</i>

42
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,315
<i>hiding down</i>
<i>in the root cellar</i>

43
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,284
<i>while a Comanche</i>
<i>war party</i>

44
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:56,455
<i>searches through the house</i>
<i>just over my head</i>

45
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,657
<i>hunting for me.</i>

46
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,129
<i>It's so dark down there,</i>
<i>like a grave.</i>

47
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:08,266
Man: The President of the United States!

48
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,237
Johnson:
<i>For this terrible moment,</i>

49
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,574
<i>I wonder</i>
<i>if I'm dead already...</i>

50
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,978
<i>or buried alive.</i>

51
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Mr. President.

52
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,318
Johnson: <i>I pissed myself</i>
<i>like an idiot child</i>

53
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,421
<i>crouching in the dirt,</i>

54
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,623
<i>knowing it's only</i>
<i>a matter of time now</i>

55
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,292
<i>before they find</i>
<i>the trapdoor,</i>

56
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,461
<i>discover me...</i>

57
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:42,534
<i>haul me screaming</i>
<i>up into the light...</i>

58
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,471
<i>where their knives gleam.</i>

59
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,327
All I have

60
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,396
I would have
given gladly

61
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,466
not to be
standing here today.

62
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:19,571
The greatest leader
of our time

63
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,274
has been struck down

64
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:26,411
by the foulest deed
of our time.

65
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:32,250
John F. Kennedy
told his countrymen

66
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,187
that our national work
would not be finished

67
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,889
in the life
of this administration...

68
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,761
nor even perhaps
in our own lifetime.

69
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,698
"But," he said,

70
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,868
"let us begin."

71
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,438
Today,

72
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,409
I'd say to all
my fellow Americans,

73
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,512
"Let us continue."

74
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,522
We have talked
long enough

75
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,959
in this country
about civil rights.

76
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:19,397
We have talked
for 100 years or more.

77
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,935
It is time now to write the
next chapter in the books of law.

78
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,939
I urge you to enact

79
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,777
President Kennedy's
civil rights bill into law

80
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,947
so that we can eliminate
from this nation

81
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,216
every trace
of discrimination

82
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,085
that is based upon race
or color.

83
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,587
Man:
<i>That's right!</i>

84
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:19,991
You hear what that Negro comedian
Dick Gregory said about me?

85
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,661
"When Lyndon Johnson
finished his speech,

86
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,730
20 million Negroes
unpacked."

87
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,733
That was a fine speech,
Mr. President.

88
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:32,103
Dear to my heart, but I know some people
are wondering, "Did he really mean it?"

89
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,839
Johnson: <i>Well, you could tell</i>
<i>that liberal crowd of yours</i>

90
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,275
that I'm gonna
out-Lincoln Lincoln.

91
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,277
But you need
to get behind me

92
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,913
because you know Dick
Russell and the Dixiecrats

93
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,949
are gonna fight me
tooth and nail

94
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,684
on this civil rights
stuff.

95
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,786
Now, not too tight
in the bunghole, Manny.

96
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,088
And give me some extra room
in my pockets there

97
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,357
for my stuff-
my keys and my knife-

98
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,292
and leave me some slack
for my nut sack.

99
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,227
Johnson:<i> Walter!</i>

100
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,597
Walter, you let me know the
minute Dick Russell gets here

101
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,132
and get me Katharine Graham
from the "Post," will you?

102
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,868
But timing is critical here,
Hubert, you understand me?

103
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,770
<i>With the election</i>
<i>only 11 months away...</i>

104
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:09,407
If the Republicans are foolish
enough to nominate Barry Goldwater,

105
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,943
you'll beat him with both
hands tied behind your back.

106
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,579
Well, Goldwater is tougher
than you think.

107
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,215
But first, I gotta win
the Democratic nomination.

108
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,851
Holy crap.
What happened here?

109
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,854
You tell Lady Bird about this
and she'll starve me for a month.

110
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,357
- Senator Russell.
- Oh, yep, yep.

111
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,491
Give me one minute.

112
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,360
George Wallace
is a nobody.

113
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,495
Well, it wasn't Wallace
I'm thinking of.

114
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,063
You don't have
to worry about Bobby.

115
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,934
Bobby Kennedy would just soon
cut my throat as smile at me.

116
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:38,570
You know
how strongly I feel

117
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,038
about this
civil rights bill.

118
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,706
<i>If there's anything</i>
<i>I can do-</i>

119
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,541
Yeah, yeah, I'll keep that
in mind, Hubert.

120
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,111
Mr. President.

121
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,180
- Senator Russell.
- Johnson:<i> Ah.</i>

122
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,716
Uncle Dick.

123
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,719
Well, well, well.

124
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:00,925
- Mr. President.
- Aw, Lyndon, Lyndon, please.

125
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,062
No, sir.
No, not anymore.

126
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,864
Wouldn't be
respectful.

127
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,399
Well, in public, then,

128
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,634
but nothing else
changes between us.

129
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,038
Now, hell, I owe
everything I have

130
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,173
to your good wisdom
and generosity,

131
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,409
and don't you think for a
second I'll ever forget it.

132
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,845
Well, you did throw me for
a bit of a loop last night.

133
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:24,416
A civil rights bill with
your election coming up-

134
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,719
for a hundred years, the Democratic
Party's had a lock on the South.

135
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,854
It'd be a foolish thing
to throw that away.

136
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:30,989
Oh, hell, Dick,

137
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,691
you know I got
to throw Humphrey

138
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,059
and the rest
of those liberals

139
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,694
a little bit of red meat
now and again.

140
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,630
- Yes, but- - Sir, Dr. Martin
Luther King is on three.

141
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,266
Well, he can wait.

142
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,773
So last night was just, uh,
election year politics or not?

143
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,508
Absolutely.

144
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,079
But I need you to hold the
South for me, Uncle Dick.

145
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,782
Party unity, it is gonna be critical.

146
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,984
Well, we can
talk more about it

147
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:03,421
when Lady Bird and I have you over
for dinner on Thursday, as usual.

148
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,691
Oh, there's no need
for that now.

149
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,093
Oh.

150
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,994
Our Thursday dinners
are sacred.

151
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,198
- Well...
- Hey, why don't you bring your swimsuit

152
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,799
and you could paddle
your milk-white ass

153
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,868
around the White House pool
before dinner, huh?

154
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,439
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

155
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,974
Thank you, Senator.

156
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,715
What the hell
was she thinking?

157
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,751
Won't happen again, sir.

158
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,419
<i>J. Edgar Hoover on four.</i>

159
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,022
I mean no disrespect, but take
down that stuff over there.

160
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,928
- Edgar.
- Mr. President.

161
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,532
The FBI is here to assist
in any way we can.

162
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,334
Johnson:
<i>Oh, hell, Edgar,</i>

163
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,336
you're more than
the head of the Bureau.

164
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,871
You're my brother.

165
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,307
Now, if the Bureau needs anything
from me, you just let me know.

166
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,309
<i>Well, in light</i> <i>of your
announcement</i> <i>last night,</i>

167
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,112
I think we should have a
discussion regarding Dr. King.

168
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,616
I recently acquired certain
information which is deeply troubling.

169
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,785
Uh, Edgar- Edgar,
I hate to interrupt,

170
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,154
- but they're pulling me six ways from Sunday.
- Staff: Mr. President!

171
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,890
I'm interested in this and
we'll talk soon, I promise.

172
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,992
Hoover:
<i>If I can just-</i>

173
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,194
Did King screw
his sister or something?

174
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,962
That man's obsessed.

175
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,099
All right, Manny, let's
just get this over with.

176
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,568
What?

177
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,003
What is it?

178
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,905
Katharine Graham of the
"Washington Post" is on two.

179
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,575
- What?
- And Dr. King is still on three.

180
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:34,145
Look, I don't need to be
reminded of what I already know.

181
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,414
God damn it,
you know, you're fired.

182
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,116
Go on, get the hell out of here.

183
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,386
Walter, get me another secretary
who knows what she's doing.

184
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,655
And one with a little meat on her bones,

185
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,123
for Christ's sake.

186
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,892
Not another one of these
scrawny, old Washington biddies.

187
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,794
Oh, God damn it, Manny.

188
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,397
Don't you have anything that doesn't
make me look like a dago undertaker?

189
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,700
I wanna thank you,
Dr. King,

190
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,669
for your public
expression of support.

191
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:01,105
We were all very heartened by your
speech last night, Mr. President.

192
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,675
Well, it ain't
gonna be easy.

193
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,444
-<i> It's a difficult time.</i>
- Yes, it is.

194
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,514
But as you suggested,

195
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,550
the greatest tribute
we can pay to President Kennedy

196
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,686
is to enact
his civil rights bill,

197
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,321
especially voting rights.

198
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,657
Yeah, well, you're preaching
to the choir there, Reverend.

199
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,194
Voting rights is the meat
of the coconut,

200
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,197
and we're gonna pass
that bill as is

201
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,532
without changing a word.

202
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,200
But, boy, I'm gonna
have to have your help.

203
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,736
Well, you know
you have it, sir.

204
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,072
Well, thank you, Martin.
Thank you.

205
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,441
And listen, why don't you call
next time you're up here

206
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,309
and any suggestions
you have,

207
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,345
-<i> bring them in.</i>
- Well, actually-

208
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,487
Just blowing smoke
up my ass.

209
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,224
He called for a civil rights
bill in front of Congress, Martin.

210
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:55,627
King: <i>Kennedy made
promises,</i> <i>too, Stanley.</i>

211
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,396
- He just never delivered.
- He's no George Wallace.

212
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,965
You sure? So deep in
Russell's back pocket,

213
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,268
- you'd think
he was humping him.

214
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,336
He passed the '57
Civil Rights Act.

215
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,372
After he
gutted it first.

216
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,073
That bill was like soup

217
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,843
made from the bones
of an emaciated chicken.

218
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:14,913
Levison: <i>Martin, listen,</i>
<i>he's a Southern politician.</i>

219
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,049
<i>He's spent his entire life</i>
<i>trying to be president.</i>

220
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,584
<i>But he's there now.</i>

221
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,654
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>he can do whatever he wants.</i>

222
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,089
That's the question,
isn't it?

223
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,425
What does Lyndon Johnson
really want?

224
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,361
Well, whatever it is,
11 months from now,

225
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,330
he has to run
for reelection.

226
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,934
Like Kennedy, he damn sure is
gonna need the Negro vote to win.

227
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,468
Amen.

228
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,338
L.B.J. wants our support.

229
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,875
Okay.

230
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,614
But this president is gonna have
to deliver a real civil rights bill.

231
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,017
And we're gonna hold his feet
to the fire until he does.

232
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,919
- Levison:<i> Damn right.</i>
- Abernathy:<i> That's right.</i>

233
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,955
<i>...11 months from now,</i>

234
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,957
<i>he has to run</i>
<i>for reelection.</i>

235
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:02,593
<i>Like Kennedy,</i> <i>he damn sure is
gonna need</i> <i>the Negro vote to win.</i>

236
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,595
Abernathy:
<i>Amen.</i>

237
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,230
Hoover:
Stanley Levison.

238
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,800
Why is this so-called
"Reverend" Martin Luther King

239
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,269
taking advice from a
well-known Communist agitator?

240
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,204
That's a very good
question, sir.

241
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,839
Let's see who else
King is meeting.

242
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,774
I want all his travel
covered from now on.

243
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,544
- Get started.
- Yes, sir.

244
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,347
I will leave the goddamn
Democratic Party

245
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,514
before I turn it over

246
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:26,117
to a bunch
of Congolese savages.

247
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,186
Now, hold on
a second, Strom.

248
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,689
This bill is just
the thin edge of the wedge.

249
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,526
You saw what King and his
bunch did in Birmingham.

250
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,829
<i>Why, integrated buses</i>
<i>are just the beginning.</i>

251
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:41,132
<i>Now we gotta shop with them,</i>
<i>eat with them, work with them.</i>

252
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,901
We have been oppressed and
degraded by black, slimy,

253
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,372
- unbearably stinking niggers.
- That's enough of that kind of talk.

254
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,806
That's exactly
what they wanna hear

255
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:52,443
so they can dismiss us all
as a bunch of redneck goons.

256
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,554
Thank you, Joles.

257
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,593
We have to be very careful
how we handle this.

258
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,828
The issue
is not about race.

259
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,197
It's about the gravest
possible assault

260
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,166
on the United States
Constitution,

261
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,801
which we are fighting
to defend.

262
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,838
The president is actively
gathering signatures

263
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,240
for a discharge petition

264
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,042
to get the bill out of
my committee in the House.

265
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,810
And what do you expect
him to do, Judge?

266
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,546
He's got to at least look
lively on civil rights.

267
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,515
When the time comes,
he's gonna do the right thing.

268
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,985
- He'll gut the bill?
- Yes. He knows who his friends are.

269
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,087
But if he gets the bill
out of my committee?

270
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,789
It still has to go
through the House,

271
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,190
then out
of Jim's committee

272
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,925
before it even gets
to the Senate floor.

273
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,795
And none of this can get
in the way of party unity.

274
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,597
In this election, we can
have a lock on the Senate

275
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:50,668
and a lock on the House and we can
elect a Southern Democrat president.

276
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,639
It's about time the South
rejoined the rest of the country.

277
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,577
My friends,
if we do our part,

278
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,048
Lyndon is gonna know who
to thank on November 4th.

279
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,051
And don't you worry
about the president.

280
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,987
I know how to handle him.

281
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,557
Well, the mainstream
of American politics

282
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,027
has carried you and me down to
the road to statism and socialism

283
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,930
and the destruction of the
Constitution of the United States.

284
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,065
And I am, for one,
am already out

285
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,101
of the mainstream
of American politics.

286
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,204
Russell: He sure gets people stirred up,

287
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,306
even in Milwaukee.

288
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,274
Johnson: When we get to Atlantic City,

289
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,710
I will be
the Democratic nominee.

290
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,279
But how damaged
will you be?

291
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,816
Be plenty strong enough
for Goldwater in November.

292
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,985
What if Bobby
smells blood

293
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:43,554
and decides to run
at the last minute?

294
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:47,859
That little shit doesn't have
his brother's balls.

295
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:51,295
Still has
his daddy's money.

296
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,197
You might win
the nomination.

297
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,934
- But if the party splits...
- Oh, come on now, Dick.

298
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,872
All Wallace has
to beat you with

299
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,840
is this damn
civil rights bill

300
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,709
and I don't,
for the life of me,

301
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,044
understand why you are
giving him this issue.

302
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,981
At this point, I'm more
worried about the liberals

303
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,283
than I am about
the Dixiecrats.

304
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,819
We got to give them
something this time, Dick.

305
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,523
-<i> You know that.</i>
- You got to look like you're giving them something.

306
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,491
All I'm saying is
don't work so hard

307
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,027
to get this bill
out of the House.

308
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,595
I do what I can.

309
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,264
Lady Bird:
<i>Now, Lyndon,</i>

310
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,299
you're gonna talk
poor Uncle Dick to death

311
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,301
and here Zephyr's made
his favorite dinner

312
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,937
- and it's getting cold.
- Saved by the belle.

313
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,539
Bird, you look
beautiful as always.

314
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,642
Oh, and you are
a terrible liar as always.

315
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,477
Politician's curse.

316
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,681
Russell: <i>So, do you like</i>
<i>being the First Lady?</i>

317
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,683
Lady Bird: <i>Well, it's
been</i> <i>an adjustment.</i>

318
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,252
- Russell:<i> I can imagine.</i>
-<i> But I am enjoying it.</i>

319
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,594
"Any jackass
can kick a barn down,

320
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,964
but it takes a carpenter
to build one."

321
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,867
You remember
who told me that?

322
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,835
Sam Rayburn?

323
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:08,439
Sam Rayburn,
Speaker of the House.

324
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,609
Oh, I could've
kissed his bald head.

325
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,845
Thank you.

326
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,415
God knows I've been
kissing his ass

327
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:20,084
since the day I moved
to Washington,

328
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,820
trying to get him
to take notice of me.

329
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,756
You know what
Mr. Sam wanted?

330
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,693
- His greatest regret?
- No, sir.

331
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,329
A towheaded boy
to take fishing.

332
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,301
Well, I heard that and I did
my damnedest to be that boy.

333
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,104
Suck-up? Yeah.

334
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,639
Brown-noser? Sure.

335
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,141
Kiss-ass? You bet.
I heard them all.

336
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,278
Fuck you!

337
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,147
Everybody
wants power, Walter.

338
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,183
Everybody.

339
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,819
And if they say
they don't, they're lying.

340
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,187
Yes, sir.

341
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,090
But everybody thinks
it ought to be given out,

342
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:02,727
free of charge
like Mardi Gras beads.

343
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,229
Especially to them
because, of course,

344
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:08,065
they're gonna
do good with it.

345
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,569
Nothing comes free.

346
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,205
Nothing.

347
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,908
Not even good.

348
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,881
Especially not good.

349
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,453
<i>When the carpenter</i>
<i>picks up his saw,</i>

350
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:33,024
if wood could talk...

351
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,527
it would scream.

352
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,064
Humphrey: You cannot cut voting rights

353
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,832
out of the civil
rights bill.

354
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:45,636
Well, you can't pass the civil
rights bill with it, not this year.

355
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:49,340
You told Dr. King you wanted this
bill passed without one word changed.

356
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,310
You don't go and sell a
horse by talking about it

357
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,578
being blind in one eye
and got the heaves.

358
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:58,215
- They're gonna think you're just gutting the bill, sir.
- Bullshit!

359
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,184
It's still
a damn good bill.

360
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,921
Public housing, access,
school desegregation.

361
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,324
- Don't you tell me that ain't nothing, God damn it!
- The liberal wing of the party

362
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,093
- will think you've betrayed them.
- Well, those are your people.

363
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,128
- It's your job to bring them around.
- My job?!

364
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,332
Hell, yes. You're the great
white hope of liberals everywhere.

365
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:16,267
Well, if I'm anything
like what you say,

366
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,636
it's because people know
I stand by my principles.

367
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:20,204
Principles?
Shit.

368
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:24,241
This ain't about principles,
it's about votes!

369
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,677
You know, that's the problem
with you goddamn liberals-

370
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,713
you don't know
how to fight.

371
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,515
- Mr. President- - You say you're
the leader of the liberal wing

372
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,050
of the Democratic Party?

373
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,419
- Then show me some goddamn leadership!
- Look out!

374
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,221
- I got no brakes!
- Look out!

375
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,056
- No brakes! Hold on!
- Oh, jeez!

376
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,125
Hold on!

377
00:22:43,296 --> 00:22:44,995
Humphrey: What in-

378
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,765
My- what?

379
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,334
I thought
I was a goner.

380
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,203
- This is watertight.
- Well, it's an amphibious car.

381
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:55,940
- It's a car and a boat.
- I have never seen such a thing.

382
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,810
I wish I had a photograph of your face.

383
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,946
- Whew!
- Humphrey: I've never.

384
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,081
Oh.

385
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:08,786
Do you wanna know what the ugliest
sound in the world is, Hubert?

386
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:12,323
It's the tick-tick-tick
of a clock.

387
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,329
All the men in my family die young.

388
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,365
I nearly died of that
heart attack 10 years ago.

389
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,336
- A terrible time.
- Yeah.

390
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,972
And I ain't got
much time left.

391
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:33,577
You and me, we got till
the convention in August,

392
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,180
while the people are still
grieving Kennedy's death,

393
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,048
to get this bill passed.

394
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:40,584
Now, if we don't act now,
this opportunity

395
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,319
to do something
about civil rights

396
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,456
will just
disappear forever.

397
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,193
- Now, are you in or are
you out? - Well, that-

398
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,129
can you get the bill out
of the House Rules Committee?

399
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,431
Leave Judge Smith to me.

400
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,299
- And voting rights.
- Next year.

401
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,101
- No-
- No, no, you have my word.

402
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,137
Gonna be a very, very
difficult sell, Mr. President.

403
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:03,140
Oh, I know.
I know.

404
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,877
That's why I want you to be
the floor manager of this bill.

405
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,013
- Floor manager?
- Uh-huh.

406
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:12,817
- I assumed that Majority
Leader Mansfield- - Oh, no, no!

407
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,118
Mike is a good man,

408
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,155
but, boy, I need
someone more personable.

409
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,424
And people
like you, Hubert.

410
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,126
Hell, even Dick Russell
likes you.

411
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,795
- Well, I wouldn't go that far.
- No, he does!

412
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,864
He does.

413
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,202
You know I'm under
a lot of pressure

414
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:34,071
to announce my running
mate for the election.

415
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,376
Now, you show me

416
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:43,013
that you got the guts
to push this thing through,

417
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,917
and you make yourself
one very real candidate

418
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,154
to become
my Vice President

419
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,723
of the United States...

420
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,759
of America.

421
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,931
A step away
from the White House.

422
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:04,802
As we've seen...

423
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,306
anything can happen
from there.

424
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,260
There's a barn owl
out there

425
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,629
in the live oaks
hunting mice.

426
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,734
Is Hubert on board?

427
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,903
Yeah.

428
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,969
One heart attack
in a lifetime is plenty,

429
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,737
thank you very much.

430
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,339
Why do I put up
with you?

431
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,208
Oh, because you would
be lost without me.

432
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:23,981
King won't be so easy.

433
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,084
He won't trust me now and
I can't say I blame him.

434
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,353
He doesn't
know you yet.

435
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:32,523
If I keep
King's support,

436
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,959
I risk losing
Uncle Dick's.

437
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:37,294
I may have
in any case.

438
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,632
I always thought it would
take a Southern president

439
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,868
to drag the South
out of the past.

440
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:49,540
Shit, they're not gonna
thank me for it.

441
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,612
King:<i> You promised this country</i> <i>a
civil rights bill,</i> <i>Mr. President.</i>

442
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:57,414
And the voting rights
component is critical.

443
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,851
Absolutely critical,
and we're gonna fix that.

444
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,987
Just not in this bill.

445
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,688
Right now,
we're gonna take care

446
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,558
of segregation in public
accommodations first.

447
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,693
I got it.
I'll get that, Manny.

448
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,195
Thank you.

449
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,467
You know, every year,
my cook Zephyr Wright-

450
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,236
oh, the best
damn chicken fried steak

451
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,338
you ever put
in your mouth-

452
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,209
well, every year, she and
her husband drive my Packard

453
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,746
from Washington back down
to the ranch for me.

454
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,749
Well, now, Zephyr,

455
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:35,586
she can't use any
restrooms on those highways

456
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,788
'cause they're all
whites only.

457
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,290
She got to squat
in a field

458
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:43,394
by the side of the road
to pee like a dog.

459
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,162
Now, that's
just not right

460
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,665
and by God,
we're gonna fix that.

461
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:51,468
Well, nothing in this country will
ever change until Negroes can vote.

462
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,872
The next bill
will be voting rights.

463
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:58,842
After President Kennedy's
election,

464
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,145
Eisenhower
had publicly declared

465
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:04,481
that his party had taken
the Negro vote for granted.

466
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,685
I would hate to see the Democratic
Party make the same mistake.

467
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,421
If you think
Barry Goldwater's

468
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,323
a legitimate heir
to Abraham Lincoln,

469
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:15,426
you should vote for him.

470
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,164
You know, civil rights
isn't the only thing

471
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,700
I'm interested in,
Dr. King.

472
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,902
We got people
in this country

473
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:27,738
living in
unbelievable poverty.

474
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,374
I know.

475
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,343
I grew up like that
in the Hill Country.

476
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,015
Picking cotton
on my hands and knees,

477
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:41,151
harnessed like a mule
to a road plow,

478
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,154
<i>living off</i> <i>the bitter
charity</i> <i>of my neighbors.</i>

479
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,490
<i>But we're gonna</i>
<i>change all that.</i>

480
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,795
We're gonna declare
a war on poverty.

481
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,764
A war on poverty?

482
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,065
That's right.

483
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,634
Now, I got all kinds
of federal programs in mind

484
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,271
on health, education,
literacy, jobs, you name it.

485
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:04,308
We're gonna change
this country top to bottom.

486
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,677
That sounds
extraordinary.

487
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,312
There you go.

488
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,681
And I would very
enthusiastically support

489
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,683
legislation
to that effect.

490
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,651
But right now,

491
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,054
I need to be able
to go back to my people

492
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,889
and tell them
that this president

493
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,824
is committed
to civil rights

494
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,328
<i>and that this bill,</i>
<i>even without voting rights,</i>

495
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,398
will still be a strong bill
with no further changes.

496
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,935
If I can't do that,
I'll lose their faith.

497
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,905
And in their despair, I-

498
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,909
I don't know
what'll happen.

499
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,979
Is that a threat?

500
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,784
I don't want riots
any more than you do.

501
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,685
But...

502
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:52,556
in order to avoid
that type of situation,

503
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:56,927
I need to be able
to deliver meaningful reform.

504
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,200
Okay.

505
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:05,969
Okay.

506
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,504
Now here's
what I need-

507
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:10,741
the bill is stuck in Judge
Smith's Rules Committee

508
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,743
and I need at least
eight votes-

509
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,179
Walter-
to pry it out.

510
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,714
Five Republicans
and three Democrats.

511
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:20,083
Walter! Oh, good.
All right, here.

512
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,952
Now, you get your people

513
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,922
in each one of these districts here
- your ministers,

514
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,691
your clergy, your union
guys, and what have you-

515
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:32,596
to lobby these House
members to release that bill.

516
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:37,234
And lobbying is just like
propositioning women, you know?

517
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,371
Oh, I knew
this fellow once, ooh!

518
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,373
He was a real ladies' man.

519
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,210
He got more pussy
than you ever saw.

520
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:50,247
And I said to him,
"What is your secret?"

521
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,684
And he said,
"Well, I go into a bar

522
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,652
and I ask each woman

523
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,055
if she'd like
to fool around."

524
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,892
I said, "Boy, you must've
got slapped a lot."

525
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,994
He said,
"Oh, hell yeah,

526
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:07,598
but I also got me
a lot of yeses."

527
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:12,870
Well, now,

528
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:16,573
we only need eight yeses

529
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,977
to get that bill out of
Judge Smith's committee.

530
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,115
All right.

531
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,552
All right.

532
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,621
He said he'd get it
out of committee

533
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,089
and by God, he did.

534
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,024
- Hallelujah.
- And all it cost us

535
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,859
was the voting rights
section.

536
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,529
King: <i>The point is we can
work</i> <i>with this president.</i>

537
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:42,032
Now he's asking
for our further assistance

538
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,867
in lobbying Congress.

539
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,302
What do we have to lose?

540
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,771
Do we have to endorse
his candidacy as well?

541
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,974
King:<i> You still plan</i> <i>on voting
Republican</i> <i>this election, Bob?</i>

542
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,411
You know, Goldwater came out
against civil rights,

543
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:57,080
purely on constitutional
grounds, of course.

544
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:00,083
- Yes, personally,
Goldwater deplores racism.

545
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,619
I just think
asking for my vote

546
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,289
while denying me the right
to vote is bullshit!

547
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,891
The bill still
gives us a lot.

548
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:09,927
Unless he gives that
away, too.

549
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,296
I have his word there will
be no more compromises.

550
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,064
His word?
Are you serious?

551
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,266
I cannot support a bill
without voting rights.

552
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,567
King:
<i>I'm not asking you to.</i>

553
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,337
I'm asking you
to not work against it.

554
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,040
The president is planning
new legislation

555
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:25,275
that will bring
a huge federal intervention

556
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:29,413
to poverty, hunger,
and jobs.

557
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,548
Think what that will do
for our people.

558
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,483
- 40 acres and a mule.
- Moses:<i> That's right.</i>

559
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,185
What if he's serious?

560
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,857
Okay, we will not campaign
against the bill,

561
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,893
but we're not gonna sit
on our hands either.

562
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:46,463
What does the visionary
Bob Moses propose?

563
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:48,598
Freedom Summer.

564
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:51,068
We are going to flood
the state of Mississippi

565
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,036
with hundreds
of student volunteers

566
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,305
- to educate and register Negro voters.
- Abernathy: You crazy.

567
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,809
- Mississippi?
- Not just Negro volunteers.

568
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:02,779
- White students, too.
- If just one of your white volunteers gets hurt,

569
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,415
you will do irreparable
damage to the cause.

570
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,652
- Abernathy:<i> That's right.</i>
- Whereas if one of our Negro volunteers gets hurt,

571
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:10,087
who gives a fuck?

572
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,788
There may be trouble,

573
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,624
but if it takes some white kid
getting smacked around

574
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:17,894
to shed a little light on the
darkness that is Mississippi,

575
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,397
-<i> then why not?!</i>
- Because people will die in Mississippi!

576
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,766
- Roy, people are dying in Mississippi.
- Exactly!

577
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:26,136
- We're not asking- - All
right, all right, calm down.

578
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:30,173
Nobody in here gonna do
anything they can't get behind.

579
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:33,543
But we should respond to the
elimination of voting rights,

580
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:36,380
and Freedom Summer is the
perfect way to do that.

581
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,515
At the same time, Roy,
you are right.

582
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:41,618
The bill still does
give us a lot.

583
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,322
No one in this room has
your legislative experience.

584
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,091
<i>So clearly,</i>
<i>you and the NAACP</i>

585
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,761
should lead our
lobbying efforts in DC.

586
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,262
Hmm.

587
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,264
All right?

588
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,834
Yes, okay.

589
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:03,774
Gentlemen.

590
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:17,087
Lord have mercy.

591
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,756
One of these days, Stokely and
Wilkins gonna kill each other

592
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,425
right there in the middle
of the room.

593
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,627
King: <i>In that case,</i>
<i>we should sell tickets</i>

594
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,362
<i>so I can stop</i>
<i>giving speeches.</i>

595
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,865
I know that's right.

596
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,567
First thing tomorrow,

597
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,203
let's reach out and get
our membership mobilized

598
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:34,938
on this new campaign.

599
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,106
Yeah.

600
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,607
You need anything else?

601
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,276
I'm okay.

602
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,811
Good night, then.

603
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,363
Give me a minute.

604
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,547
Whoo!

605
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,983
The sex-mad preacher.

606
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:22,452
His hypocrisy
is disgusting.

607
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:24,521
The man is
a flagrant adulterer.

608
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,022
Oh, my.

609
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,625
A Southern preacher
who fucks his choir.

610
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:29,926
Who ever heard of that?

611
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:33,663
Oh, Edgar,

612
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,532
if you arrested
every politician

613
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,301
and every preacher who ever
strayed from the marital bed,

614
00:35:38,403 --> 00:35:40,237
wouldn't be nobody
in politics or the pulpit.

615
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:43,373
His moral turpitude is
just the tip of the iceberg.

616
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,208
Why, his- his Communist
connections-

617
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,576
Edgar,

618
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:49,946
far be it from me to tell
you how to do your job.

619
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,549
So keep an eye
on him, sure,

620
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:57,787
but the House is about to
vote on my civil rights bill.

621
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,490
And this...

622
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,425
is not helpful.

623
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,795
-<i> You understand me?</i>
- Yes, sir.

624
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,832
Reporter on TV:
<i>As part of Freedom Summer,</i>

625
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,301
<i>the Student Nonviolent</i>
<i>Coordinating Committee,</i> <i>or SNCC,</i>

626
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,804

<i>to join other</i> <i>Freedom Summer

631
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,852

632
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:30,387
the dangers

<i>and the Mississippi government</i> <i>will

635
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,461
If at any time

636
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:42,499
<i>you should do so,</i>
<i>including now.</i>

637
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,605
All right.

638
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,340
Let's get started.

647
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,695
We will now call the House

648
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:15,632
<i>to consider</i>
<i>House Bill 736,</i>

649
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:19,836
the Civil Rights Act
of 1964.

650
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,871
- Smith:<i> Mr. Speaker.</i>
- Can you hear that?

651
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:25,976
<i>This bill is nothing less</i> <i>than
an assault on</i> <i>the Constitution</i>

652
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,310
<i>by the federal</i>
<i>government.</i>

653
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,214
<i>Who are we</i>

654
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,316
to tell the owner
of a cafe

655
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,919
who he can hire
or who he can serve?

656
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,591
Who are we
to tell a state

657
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,728
that they may not pass
segregation laws?

658
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,600
As a conservative
Republican,

659
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,136
I believe
that state authority

660
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,805
should not be
needlessly usurped.

661
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,574
Hear, hear.

662
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,043
But I also believe
that the Constitution

663
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:02,479
doesn't say
that whites alone

664
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,648
shall have
our basic rights.

665
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,151
Didn't see that coming.

666
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:12,489
McCulloch is just playing
to the peanut gallery.

667
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,357
Well.

668
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,326
<i>Are you, Lyndon?</i>

669
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:20,330
Is this just still so much red
meat for Humphrey and his gang?

670
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,800
People aren't gonna stand for
Jim Crow anymore, Uncle Dick.

671
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,703
I'm not saying the Negro
hasn't been put upon.

672
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,839
He has been put upon
most disgracefully.

673
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,341
<i>But you can't rush</i>
<i>these things.</i>

674
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,642
<i>Look at the mess</i>
<i>in Mississippi</i>

675
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,045
with all those agitators
going down there

676
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,813
getting in
people's business.

677
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,682
Folks are gonna
get hurt.

678
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,717
And whose fault
would that be?

679
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,019
Smith:
<i>Mr. Speaker,</i>

680
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,256
I would like
to introduce an amendment

681
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,525
that would exempt
local businesses

682
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,593
in public accommodations.

683
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,165
For instance,
if you were a podiatrist

684
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:58,335
- and had your office in a hotel...
- Man: Come on!

685
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,437
...if I were
cutting corns,

686
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,472
I would wanna know
whose feet

687
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,208
I was gonna have to be
monkeying around with.

688
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,609
<i> Boo!</i>

689
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,179
Unbelievable.

690
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:13,550
I would want to know whether
they smelled good or bad.

691
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,518
-<i> Boo!</i>
-<i> God's honest truth.</i>

692
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:21,758
Podiatrists, like other
minorities, got rights, too.

693
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,194
-<i> That's nonsense!</i>
-<i> Yes, sir!</i>

694
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:26,429
To force them to work

695
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,600
violates the 13th Amendment's
prohibition against slavery

696
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,369
or involuntary servitude.

697
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,637
You know, if that's the best
the judge has to offer,

698
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,507
he should've lost his
chairmanship a long time ago.

699
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,409
- Lyndon.
- Man:<i> Mr. Speaker...</i>

700
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,278
I, for one, am fed up
with amendments

701
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,949
that suddenly or blatantly
defeat the purpose of this bill.

702
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:51,888
And to my esteemed
colleague Judge Smith,

703
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,659
if you're going to trim the
stinky, smelly white corns...

704
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:01,664
...you're gonna have to do the
same thing to the black ones.

705
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,267
That's telling him.

706
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,536
My goodness, man.

707
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:08,605
Call for a vote,
for God's sakes.

708
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:10,407
McCormack: <i>With no more
amendments</i> <i>to be offered,</i>

709
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:13,109
<i>the Speaker calls</i>
<i>for a final vote</i>

710
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,678
<i>on House Bill 736.</i>

711
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:18,415
- Abbitt.
-<i> Nay.</i>

712
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,717
<i>Mr. Abbitt votes nay.</i>

713
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:21,951
Abele.

714
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,988
-<i> Yea.</i>
-<i> Mr. Abele votes yea.</i>

715
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,523
- Adair.
-<i> Yea.</i>

716
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,558
-<i> Albert.</i>
-<i> Nay.</i>

717
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,727
<i>Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>from Alabama?</i>

718
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,996
-<i> Nay.</i>
-<i> Mr. Andrews votes nay.</i>

719
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,697
<i>Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>from North Dakota.</i>

720
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,567
-<i> Yea.</i>
-<i> Mr. Andrews votes yea.</i>

721
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,577
290 votes for

722
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,180
and 130 votes against.

723
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,751
The bill passes and will
now go to the Senate.

724
00:40:54,853 --> 00:40:57,320
We got it, Walter.
Thank you.

725
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:07,997
General Burnside thought he'd
crush Lee at Fredericksburg.

726
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,067
His overconfidence
cost him his army.

727
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:15,905
And only three years later,
Lee surrendered at Appomattox.

728
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,744
Nobody's surrendering,
Mr. President.

729
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:26,382
Thank you, Matthew.
Most kind.

730
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:33,256
Reporter on TV:
<i>In St. Augustine, Florida,</i>

731
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,458
<i>Negro demonstrators</i>
<i>were attacked today</i>

732
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,660
<i>by an estimated</i>
<i>500 angry whites</i>

733
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,829
<i>when they broke through</i>
<i>police lines.</i>

734
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,465
<i>The conflict began</i>
<i>when 200 Negro demonstrators</i>

735
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,101
<i>led by Andrew Young</i> <i>and
other civil rights</i> <i>leaders...</i>

736
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:48,171
"Trust L.B.J.
He's one of us."

737
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,940
Is this the first time
a civil rights bill

738
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,308
made it through
the House?

739
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,344
So the bill goes
to the Senate.

740
00:41:54,446 --> 00:41:56,980
All right?
So what?

741
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,681
How many
civil rights bills

742
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,517
have you buried
in the last 10 years?

743
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:04,254
- 121.
- That graveyard of yours got room for one more?

744
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,222
I'm digging a hole
as we speak.

745
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:10,727
- Well, all right, then.
- If you do get it out of committee, what then?

746
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:14,030
Then we filibuster it
to death.

747
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,499
We stick together,
we'll be fine.

748
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,668
Public opinion's
already against this bill,

749
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,904
<i>especially with</i>
<i>those riots going on.</i>

750
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:23,406
Time is on our side.

751
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,310
Thank you, gentlemen.

752
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,682
And I see no need
why we ought to sit idly by

753
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:36,419
and see a bill pass in the American
Senate called a civil rights bill

754
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:40,523
that will destroy individual
liberty and freedom in this country.

755
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:43,893
Humphrey:
<i>Wallace is running at 90%</i>

756
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,528
with whites
in Eastern Maryland.

757
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,065
If he wins that primary, the
Senate will never pass the bill.

758
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,401
- - Wallace would be
dead in the water

759
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,002
without these
goddamn riots.

760
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,971
He is deliberately
provocative.

761
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,006
King is supposed to
control his people.

762
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,075
I put my entire
political career

763
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,044
at risk for the Negroes
and this is the thanks I get?

764
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:04,347
- Put more money into Maryland.
- Yeah, beef up my schedule there.

765
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,916
Now, what's your plan to get our
bill out of Eastland's committee?

766
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:10,753
- Discharge petition.
- Oh, shit, why, you don't have the votes.

767
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,323
No, but, uh,
we're very close.

768
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,725
Close?
Close don't make shit.

769
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,860
You don't have
the goddamn votes.

770
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,562
Fine, what's your idea?

771
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,264
What?
I can't hear

772
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,166
a goddamn thing
you're saying, Humphrey.

773
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,734
Come on over here.

774
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,905
I said what's your idea?

775
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,807
<i>Well, right now</i>

776
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,443
<i>it's all about</i>
<i>the rules of the Senate.</i>

777
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:35,878
<i>And Dick Russell's</i>
<i>been studying them</i>

778
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:38,147
<i>since he was sucking</i>
<i>on his mama's titty.</i>

779
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,551
Boy, I've seen him
make a fool of you liberals

780
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,720
with some arcane
rule of order

781
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:47,090
more times than-
than I can remember.

782
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,695
Hold on.

783
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:58,201
Ah, son of a...

784
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,937
<i> Oh.</i>

785
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,139
You know what?

786
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,907
There is a way
that we can

787
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,144
completely bypass
Eastland's committee

788
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,947
without a discharge
petition.

789
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,317
And with a little luck,

790
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:18,354
Russell won't even
see it coming.

791
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,858
Russell:
He did what?

792
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,626
Man's voice: <i>I think the president</i>
<i>just put over the bill</i>

793
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:24,794
<i>out of committee.</i>

794
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,062
All right.

795
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,931
All right,
keep Jim calm.

796
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,034
I'll handle this.

797
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,006
Johnson:
<i>What you think it is?</i>

798
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,408
Why it tastes
a little different?

799
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,043
Well, it's the temperature
she cooked-

800
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,678
everything all right,
Uncle Dick?

801
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,880
Just peachy.

802
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,851
Would you like
some more gravy?

803
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,921
Oh, Lady Bird, it was delicious,
but I just couldn't possibly.

804
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,357
- No, thank you.
- Hey, what about me?

805
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,092
Aren't you gonna
offer me any more gravy?

806
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,795
Well, honey, I'd like to,
but I can't.

807
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:00,797
Bird's got me
on a diet.

808
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:02,165
Got Zephyr there
in the kitchen

809
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,534
weighing my plates
for every meal.

810
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:06,235
It's ridiculous!

811
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,171
Your wife
just doesn't want you

812
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,139
to get too big
for your britches.

813
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:13,943
An entirely
understandable concern.

814
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:22,752
I think I'll see how Zephyr's
coming with that cobbler.

815
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:38,434
I just heard how you snuck that
bill through Jim's committee

816
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:41,704
with some bogus procedural
point of order.

817
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,275
A perfectly legal maneuver, Uncle Dick.

818
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:51,180
- Just like you taught me.
- I also taught you something about party loyalty.

819
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:53,816
<i>Well,</i>
<i>the party's changing.</i>

820
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:57,153
This younger generation's
not gonna fall on their sword

821
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,421
for segregation.

822
00:45:58,523 --> 00:45:59,922
You think
every Southerner

823
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,892
is gonna start dancing
to your tune, hmm?

824
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,161
<i>Wallace almost won</i>
<i>Maryland.</i>

825
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,064
- But he didn't.
- Another riot and he will.

826
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,699
And there will be
more riots.

827
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,634
We're gonna filibuster
this bill.

828
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,604
- It will never pass.
- Are you so sure about that?

829
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:16,105
<i>I know</i>
<i>what you're thinking.</i>

830
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,474
You're thinking
you're gonna cut a deal

831
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:19,976
with Senator Dirksen.

832
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,477
You filibuster,
what choice do you leave me?

833
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:25,248
A Democratic president
ignoring his own party

834
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,483
and making a deal with
the Senate Minority Leader.

835
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:31,954
- Shameful!
- Now, don't you get all high and mighty with me.

836
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,923
<i>You have been</i>
<i>cutting deals</i>

837
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:36,125
with those conservative
Republicans for years,

838
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:38,060
but now I can't
cross the aisle?

839
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:39,862
Shit.

840
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,839
We don't
have to fight, Dick.

841
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,280
Yes, we do.

842
00:47:03,288 --> 00:47:05,788
I'm coming
for you, Dick.

843
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:12,361
Now, I love you
more than my own daddy.

844
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,967
But if you
get in my way...

845
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,237
I'll crush you.

846
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,273
I regret
that the president

847
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,976
has embraced
the radical program

848
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:28,477
of the left-wing groups

849
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,181
that is erroneously called
the civil rights bill.

850
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:36,452
It is still a vicious
assault on the Constitution.

851
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:38,221
And we in the Senate

852
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:40,723
intend to fight
with our boots on

853
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:42,525
to the last ditch.

854
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:47,129
Beginning today, we will
filibuster this bill.

855
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,565
Let the real war begin.

856
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,969
This ain't about
the Constitution.

857
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,038
It's about those
who got more

858
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,140
wanting to hang on
to what they got

859
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,409
at the expense of those
who got nothing

860
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,744
and feel good about it.

861
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:04,046
Yeah, but the way
he frames it,

862
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,682
draping himself
in the Stars and Stripes,

863
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,184
it's compelling.

864
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:11,120
I mean, what are you fighting
for, darling, in your heart?

865
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,823
That's what the people
need to hear.

866
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,792
Look at that.

867
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,327
Look at that. Look at
the size of his ears.

868
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,863
You get that?

869
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:26,068
Whoo-hoo!

870
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,970
Well, listen,

871
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,939
I just wanna thank you all
for coming up here

872
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,408
and sharing some time
with me.

873
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,310
I wanted to just respond

874
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,714
to what Senator Russell-
his decision, uh-

875
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:42,818
unfortunate decision
on filibustering this bill.

876
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:48,424
It reminds me that when-
when I got out of college,

877
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:53,029
now, the only job
that I could get

878
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:57,400
was teaching first grade
at this, uh-

879
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:01,637
this beat-up, old elementary
school in Cotulla, Texas.

880
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:05,308
<i>It was just a dusty,</i>
<i>old border town</i>

881
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,344
in the middle
of nowhere

882
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:14,050
full of Mexican immigrants who
didn't have a pot to piss in.

883
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:19,255
But, God, did I love
those kids of mine.

884
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,225
They'd show up hungry
every morning

885
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:26,696
because most of them
hadn't had any breakfast.

886
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:31,233
But they were
so on fire to learn.

887
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:34,704
It just made you
feel good.

888
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:40,443
But there-
there come a day

889
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,445
for each
and every one of them

890
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:46,949
when I would see
the light in their eyes die.

891
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:53,055
'Cause they had discovered
that the world hated them...

892
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:57,760
just 'cause of the color
of their skin.

893
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,703
Well, some folks tell me
just to go slow.

894
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:11,407
<i>They say the political risk</i>
<i>is too high.</i>

895
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,210
And to that,
I say, well,

896
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:18,714
if a president can't do
what he knows is right,

897
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,450
then what's
the presidency for?

898
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:29,291
Senator Dirksen's
so-called amendments

899
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:33,095
are like putting
a Band-Aid on a cancer.

900
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,098
I have a real amendment to offer.

901
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,901
This map shows
the current concentration

902
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,771
of the Negro race
in America.

903
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:45,474
I propose we resettle
Southern Negroes

904
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,543
all over the country...

905
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,412
...until
racial proportions

906
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:52,448
are equalized
among the 50 states.

907
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,385
- - I favor inflicting
on New York

908
00:50:56,487 --> 00:51:00,156
and other cities
the same conditions

909
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,691
that will be inflicted
by this bill

910
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:05,528
on the innocent people
of Georgia.

911
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,706
Is the president
caving in?

912
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,542
I'd ask him myself,

913
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:23,412
- but he's no longer returning my calls.
- Absolutely not.

914
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,282
My people have made
every painful sacrifice

915
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:29,251
that's been asked of them
and the bill's still stuck.

916
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,420
Martin, I'm as frustrated as you are,

917
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:35,024
but lining up votes to break the
filibuster's a complicated process.

918
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:37,193
Dirksen's amendments
will gut the bill.

919
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:40,162
Dirksen needs to look
tough to his people.

920
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,299
The time
for posturing is over.

921
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,634
It's time to act.

922
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,237
I've put all my credibility on the line

923
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:51,674
telling our young people that
this president can be trusted,

924
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:53,909
but they want results.

925
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,345
They're down
in Mississippi right now

926
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,847
putting
their lives at risk,

927
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:01,750
registering Negroes for a
vote they still don't have.

928
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:03,385
I want a good bill,
too, Martin,

929
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,387
but you can't
give people blood tests

930
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,056
for loyalty
every 15 minutes.

931
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,258
The president will handle
Everett Dirksen.

932
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,760
If this is what it takes
to move the bill,

933
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:15,030
I will start
a public fast to the death.

934
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,933
God, Martin,
that's not necessary.

935
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:21,303
What choice do I have?

936
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,706
- - Woman:<i> Right this way,</i>
<i>Senator Dirksen.</i>

937
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:28,544
Everett, what's this bullshit
about how I treat my dog?

938
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,881
- I'm sorry?
- My dog, Little Beagle Johnson.

939
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,083
Why are you being such
a shithead with the press

940
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,784
about me pulling
on his ears?

941
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:38,320
Little son of a bitch loves
to have his ears pulled.

942
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:42,224
Hell, I thought you were running the
Senate Republicans, not the ASPCA.

943
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,393
Mr. President, I was just
kidding with the press about that.

944
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:48,364
Well, don't. I'm a hell of a lot
better than you are with dogs.

945
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:50,566
Dogs and people.

946
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,669
I was hoping
we could talk about-

947
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:56,305
About appointing William
Macomber as ambassador, I know.

948
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,674
- Is that among- - Get this
shot. Get this shot here.

949
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:00,075
Johnson:<i> There we go.</i>

950
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:01,744
No, no,
sit on over there.

951
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:03,646
- It's more comfortable.
- That among other things?

952
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:07,983
Well, we'll talk about all
them things in just a minute.

953
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,187
Now, look here,
Everett,

954
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:12,955
we gotta get this
civil rights bill passed.

955
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,491
- Yeah.
- The longer this filibuster goes,

956
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:16,992
the stronger
Russell gets

957
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:19,395
and the angrier those
Negroes on the street are.

958
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:22,765
- Uh-huh. - Now, how many votes
are we gonna get from your people?

959
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,901
Well, that's what I wanted to
talk to you about, Mr. President.

960
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:27,937
There are 40 amendments
I'm proposing.

961
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:32,041
- 40?
- Well, my constituents have a number of concerns.

962
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:35,611
Oh, now, let's not bullshit an
old bullshitter here, Everett.

963
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,680
Let's just cut
to the chase, shall we?

964
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:42,351
Well, I think we have to strike
equal employment altogether.

965
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,886
Hmm.

966
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:45,521
I could probably
get my troops

967
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,524
to accept
public accommodations,

968
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:52,194
but with, say, um,
a year of voluntary compliance

969
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:54,129
before it becomes law.

970
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,565
Nope.

971
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,068
- No?
- No.

972
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,703
No?

973
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,772
Is there
an echo in here?

974
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:06,108
The Southern filibuster
cannot be defeated

975
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,977
without
substantial changes.

976
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,313
But if you're willing to compromise,
I think that I can deliver

977
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:15,618
the necessary 25 Republican
votes for cloture.

978
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,954
No can do, Everett.

979
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,223
<i>Now, look here,</i>

980
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,659
either your people
vote for this bill

981
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,061
or you vote
with the segregationists

982
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,163
and the country
goes up in flames.

983
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:31,433
Now, we're making
history here, Everett,

984
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:32,901
and you have to decide

985
00:54:33,004 --> 00:54:36,372
how you want history
to remember you-

986
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:39,041
as a great man,

987
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:42,745
a man who changed
the course of this country,

988
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:47,816
or somebody who just likes
to hear himself talk.

989
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,319
Congress is not alone

990
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:52,454
in contributing problems
to the presidency.

991
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,189
<i>Mr. Johnson</i>
<i>has inherited</i>

992
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,258
<i>an armed clash</i>
<i>in South Vietnam.</i>

993
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,327
<i>President Johnson</i>
<i>must decide</i>

994
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,396
<i>whether to continue it</i>
<i>in its present form,</i>

995
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:03,132
<i>to enlarge it, or seek</i>
<i>a negotiated settlement.</i>

996
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:06,035
Our pilot the Communists
shot down over Laos,

997
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,203
- he's alive?
- As far as we know.

998
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:11,173
Well, everything we can do
to get him back home, Robert.

999
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,575
We'll talk more about
this business in Tonkin.

1000
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:16,545
- Yes, sir.
- And, Walter, anything that McNamara needs,

1001
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,247
- you make sure he gets it.
- Yes, sir.

1002
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,882
- Is Humphrey still around?
- Hey, Daddy!

1003
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,017
Hey, now, don't-
don't just run off.

1004
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,086
- Come give me a hug.
- All right.

1005
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,090
- Grae.
-<i> Mr. President.</i>

1006
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:30,125
Boy, oh, boy,
look at you.

1007
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:32,995
- You're getting tall.
- Oh, no, I'm wearing heels.

1008
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,697
Are you?

1009
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,799
Well, uh,

1010
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,767
how are you doing
in school, Luci?

1011
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,436
Good, good.

1012
00:55:40,538 --> 00:55:42,371
That's good.

1013
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:43,806
Yeah.

1014
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:46,542
Sir, um,
Senator Humphrey's here.

1015
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:47,810
- All right.
- That's all right.

1016
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,411
-<i> Bye, Daddy.</i>
- Bye.

1017
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,747
The justice says Bob Moses

1018
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,449
of the Freedom Summer
project

1019
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:55,718
<i>has asked again</i>
<i>for federal protection.</i>

1020
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,753
<i>Things are getting</i> <i>pretty
violent</i> <i>in Mississippi.</i>

1021
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,956
The federal government is not
getting involved in this.

1022
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,258
Now, you make damn sure
that the governor down there

1023
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:06,061
understands that we expect him
to put a lid on his people.

1024
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,464
Is Khrushchev
still in Egypt?

1025
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:10,966
Yes, sir, and the Soviets
had their first nuclear test

1026
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,768
at their new site
in Eastern Kazakh.

1027
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,803
Oh. All right,
talk to me, Hubert.

1028
00:56:14,905 --> 00:56:17,940
Well, the good news is we've
got a deal with Dirksen.

1029
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,275
And what's the bad news?

1030
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:22,878
We're two votes short.

1031
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,282
Bill!

1032
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:29,184
I was just thinking
about you.

1033
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,019
Go on,
take a ride with me.

1034
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:33,756
It's all right, boys. I think
I'm safe with Senator Fulbright.

1035
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,324
I'll see you up on three.

1036
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,159
Boy, oh, boy,
look at you.

1037
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:39,261
- How you feeling?
- Oh, fine, fine.

1038
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,363
- Hey, listen, I need to talk
to you about something. - Uh-huh.

1039
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:44,233
Nice cuff links,
Mr. President.

1040
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:45,501
Oh, you like these?

1041
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,169
- Do you?
- I do.

1042
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:48,670
Well, then
they are yours.

1043
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,507
No, no, that's really
not necessary.

1044
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:54,243
Well, I'd do anything
for you, Bill.

1045
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:55,811
Hey, you know
that good old boy

1046
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,780
you put down
for the federal bench?

1047
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:00,482
Boy, that's a pretty tough
sell for Humphrey's crowd,

1048
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,218
but if you were to support
the civil rights bill,

1049
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,087
they'll just grin
and bear it.

1050
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:09,091
Well, Mr. President, I'm not sure
my constituents would approve.

1051
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,292
Well, I understand that,

1052
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:12,194
but maybe you don't
have to fight

1053
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:14,129
quite as hard
as you might otherwise.

1054
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:17,166
- I don't think- - Or maybe
when the vote comes up,

1055
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:20,702
you happen to be overseas
visiting our troops.

1056
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,705
I'm sure Elizabeth
would love Europe.

1057
00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:26,542
You know she would.

1058
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,610
Like my wife.

1059
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:30,112
Here, lookie here.

1060
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:33,482
This is the seal of the
presidency of the United States.

1061
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,819
There's only two cuff links
like this in the entire world

1062
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,087
and you now
own them both.

1063
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,089
I want you to wear them
in good health, Bill.

1064
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:43,325
And think about
what I said, huh?

1065
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:46,728
You look good, Bill. I bet
you dropped a few pounds, huh?

1066
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:50,399
I'm gonna need another set
of those cuff links.

1067
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,135
What the hell?

1068
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,837
Walter.

1069
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:56,438
Walter!

1070
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,607
- - Walter! Gerri,
where's Walter?

1071
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:02,411
- Right here.
- Why the hell is Senator Engle suddenly off my list?

1072
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,947
He's paralyzed with a
malignant brain tumor, sir.

1073
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:07,216
- Recovering from surgery.
- Holy shit.

1074
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:09,852
- Well, is he conscious?
- I don't know, sir.

1075
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:12,621
Well, find out,
God damn it.

1076
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,390
If he's conscious,
he can vote!

1077
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:17,392
...but I know my Bible.

1078
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,829
And the Bible does not say that
we cannot choose our own neighbor.

1079
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:23,599
The Bible does not say
that we cannot build a wall

1080
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:26,101
betwixt ourselves
and our neighbor.

1081
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:30,239
Johnson: What I need is some
help on this cloture vote.

1082
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:32,274
No? Well,
I'll tell you

1083
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:34,209
what protects
a small state, Alan,

1084
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:36,478
and it damn sure
isn't a filibuster rule.

1085
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,748
It's a strong president
who's in your corner.

1086
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:42,851
What- now where-

1087
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,854
where on Earth
do you get that-

1088
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:48,891
well, I don't forget
these things.

1089
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,392
You understand me?

1090
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,160
Son of a bitch.

1091
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:53,729
I thought I had him.

1092
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,697
Now, for a man
named Bible,

1093
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,400
he sure doesn't have a handle
on the New Testament.

1094
00:58:58,502 --> 00:59:00,736
This bill will guarantee

1095
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:05,040
the commercial destruction
of white people everywhere!

1096
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,909
Senator Cannon,

1097
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,744
listen,
Carl Hayden and I

1098
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:12,080
are finally putting together the
Central Arizona Water Project.

1099
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:15,150
And if Nevada wants
any part of this,

1100
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,319
I need your vote.

1101
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:18,921
Yes, yes, yes,

1102
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:21,123
I know how Alan Bible
feels about it,

1103
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,591
but I'm talking
to you now,

1104
00:59:22,693 --> 00:59:25,794
combat veteran
to combat veteran.

1105
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,930
Yeah.

1106
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:31,266
Yeah, it is
a big damn decision,

1107
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:34,369
but Democrats have
to stick together here.

1108
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:39,041
Listen- no, now-
no, Howard, just-

1109
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:41,276
Howard, listen to me,
will you?

1110
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:43,011
Just listen to me.

1111
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:46,248
Now, we both got

1112
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,251
tough election fights
ahead of us here.

1113
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:52,554
You know I'm gonna be
there for you when it counts

1114
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:56,558
and can I count
on you now?

1115
01:00:00,564 --> 01:00:02,898
Howard, you do
the right thing here

1116
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,800
and you're gonna
help yourself

1117
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:07,336
and you're gonna help
your state

1118
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,805
and you're gonna help
your country.

1119
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:13,041
Will you vote
for cloture?

1120
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,350
Howard,
you're a good man.

1121
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,151
Thank you!
Bye-bye.

1122
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:26,421
- 67 votes!
- Congratulations.

1123
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:29,825
Should we let Senator Dirksen
make the public announcement?

1124
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,361
You think there's any way
we can stop him?

1125
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:39,067
Johnson:
<i>We believe all men</i>

1126
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:43,739
<i>are entitled</i>
<i>to the blessings of liberty.</i>

1127
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,041
<i>Yet millions</i>

1128
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:50,112
<i>are deprived</i>
<i>of those blessings,</i>

1129
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:54,549
not because
of their own failures,

1130
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:58,920
but because of the color
of their skin.

1131
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,392
<i>This cannot continue.</i>

1132
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:06,928
Our Constitution
forbids it.

1133
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:10,565
The principles
of freedom forbid it.

1134
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:15,671
And the law I will now sign forbids it.

1135
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,639
Thank you

1136
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:20,876
and good day.

1137
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,320
Man:
<i>Reverend King.</i>

1138
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:37,225
Humphrey: We did it. We did it.

1139
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:38,760
<i>We got it done.</i>

1140
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,328
- Man:<i> Congratulations.</i>
- Humphrey:<i> Thank you.</i>

1141
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,497
There you go, Everett.
I appreciate it.

1142
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,033
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Johnson:<i> Dr. King.</i>

1143
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,769
I need to see
Dr. King, you hear.

1144
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,705
- There you are.
- Here, Mr. President.

1145
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:52,374
- It's for you, sir.
- It's an honor, Mr. President.

1146
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:55,177
Likewise.
Thank you.

1147
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:58,146
Man:
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

1148
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:17,666
- I'm sorry, Dick.
- No, you're not.

1149
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:22,637
It's not personal.
It's just politics.

1150
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,873
It's the passing
of an era.

1151
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,408
Well, yes, it is.

1152
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:30,345
It's the passing of a time
of etiquette, courtesy.

1153
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:33,115
It's the passing
of a time of principles,

1154
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:34,616
like party unity.

1155
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:39,921
You know what the old
soldier said on parade?

1156
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:43,458
"Hey, look, everybody's
out of step but me."

1157
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,960
Maybe.

1158
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:49,097
I am old, that's true,
and God knows I'm tired.

1159
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,299
But the fellas
coming up behind me

1160
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:54,436
are utterly without
principle of any kind

1161
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:57,205
and you'll see how you like
dealing with them.

1162
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:01,009
You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

1163
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,212
I still need you, Dick.

1164
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:08,717
I'm still here,
Mr. President.

1165
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:11,419
But the rest of Dixie?

1166
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:17,425
I hope you haven't just killed
your election chances.

1167
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:26,735
Congratulations,
Mr. President,

1168
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:29,404
on your glorious
achievement.

1169
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:33,508
The Democratic Party
just lost the South

1170
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,777
for the rest
of my lifetime

1171
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:38,213
and maybe yours.

1172
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:43,518
What the fuck
are you so happy about?

1173
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:00,635
- - Reporter:<i> Senator</i>
<i>Goldwater's triumph</i>

Goldwater: ...that moderation

1184

01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:51,386
Johnson's voice: <i>I only lost one
election</i> <i>my whole life.</i>

1192
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:53,455
<i>The son of a bitch</i>
<i>stole it from me</i>

1193
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,591
<i>in the final seconds</i> <i>with
a handful</i> <i>of fake votes,</i>

1194
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,927
<i>and I will carry</i>
<i>the pain of that with me</i>

1195
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:01,129
<i>to my dying day.</i>

1196
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,797
<i>But I'll tell you what.</i>

1197
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,068
<i>Nobody will ever</i>
<i>do me that way again.</i>

1198
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:11,239
- Goldwater:...that every fiber of my being...
-<i> It'll be some other way.</i>

1199
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:14,910
Goldwater: <i>...that nothing shall
be</i> <i>lacking from the struggle...</i>

1200
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,988
Out of the car, boys.

1201
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,057
What's the problem,
Deputy Price?

1202
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:03,625
I thought we were good.

1203
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:07,162
Out of the car,
Jew boy.

1204
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:34,923
Man: <i>What you</i>
<i>looking at, nigger?</i>

1205
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,626
We've got a situation
in Mississippi.

1206
01:06:38,729 --> 01:06:41,563
- Johnson:<i> Yeah?</i>
- Three young men have gone missing.

1207
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:44,132
Michael Schwerner,
age 25,

1208
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:45,967
Andrew Goodman,
age 21,

1209
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:48,036
and James Chaney, 21.

1210
01:06:48,138 --> 01:06:51,373
They were all working the Freedom
Summer project in Meridian.

1211
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:53,475
<i>Chaney's a local Negro,</i>

1212
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:57,779
<i>but Schwerner and Goodman</i> <i>were
both out-of-state</i> <i>volunteers,</i>

1213
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:59,447
<i>both white.</i>

1214
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:02,917
Well, the shit
will hit the fan now.

1215
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,454
Get me the governor
of Mississippi.

1216
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,523
They were investigating
the burning

1217
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,458
of a Negro church
in Neshoba County.

1218
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,395
They've been missing
for 15 hours now.

1219
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:17,098
Missing in Mississippi?

1220
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,068
Son of a bitch.

1221
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:24,005
Yeah. All right,
put him through.

1222
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:27,809
- - Governor, I'm calling
about those three boys.

1223
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:30,345
You mean those three
professional agitators.

1224
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:32,680
<i>Chaney, Schwerner,</i>
<i>and Goodman.</i>

1225
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:36,418
Yeah, that come into our state
creating all kinds of problems.

1226
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,721
Apparently,
a Deputy Price

1227
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:41,756
arrested them
yesterday afternoon.

1228
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:44,959
For driving 35 miles
over the speed limit.

1229
01:07:45,062 --> 01:07:46,561
- Really?
-<i> Yes, sir.</i>

1230
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:49,798
So they held them
for a couple hours.

1231
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,267
<i>Oh, see, now that's</i>
<i>where it gets confusing</i>

1232
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:56,237
'cause when their friends
called the jail down there,

1233
01:07:56,339 --> 01:08:00,075
the deputy said
he had never heard of them.

1234
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:03,244
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

1235
01:08:03,346 --> 01:08:06,014
Uh, Price said

1236
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:09,684
he released them
at 10:00 that night.

1237
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,619
And nobody's
heard of them since.

1238
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:16,191
This is clearly
a publicity stunt.

1239
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:19,494
Well, those boys
are off hiding somewhere

1240
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,596
<i>probably having themselves</i>
<i>a good laugh,</i>

1241
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,364
<i>and they're gonna</i>
<i>come back in,</i>

1242
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:25,633
<i>they're gonna claim they were</i>
<i>abused or something.</i>

1243
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:27,168
Well, now, I'd hate
to have to send

1244
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,904
a whole bunch of federal
marshals into your state.

1245
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:33,541
Uh, well, no,
you don't wanna do that.

1246
01:08:33,643 --> 01:08:34,943
<i>Of course I don't.</i>

1247
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:36,478
You don't want
the publicity

1248
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,513
and I sure as hell
don't wanna stir up a mess

1249
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,682
just eight weeks before
the Democratic Convention.

1250
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:43,751
<i>But there's</i> <i>a lot of
pressure</i> <i>to do something.</i>

1251
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:45,720
<i>Now, if you'd rather,</i>

1252
01:08:45,822 --> 01:08:49,891
<i>I guess I can</i> <i>get a few FBI
agents</i> <i>to look into the thing.</i>

1253
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,559
FBI?

1254
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,328
Well,
it's a damn sight better

1255
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,964
than the federal marshals
and the US Army, isn't it?

1256
01:08:56,066 --> 01:09:00,135
Well, yes,
I guess it would.

1257
01:09:00,237 --> 01:09:01,369
Yeah, you know,
I think

1258
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,938
you got the right idea
there, Governor.

1259
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,509
Let this be Hoover's problem, not ours.

1260
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:09,310
Hopefully, you're right
about the whole thing

1261
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:12,647
and these boys will turn up
quick and we can all just relax.

1262
01:09:12,749 --> 01:09:14,883
Christ's sakes,
we got an election to win.

1263
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,484
Hoover will just
drag his feet.

1264
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:18,887
No, not if I light
a fire under his ass.

1265
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:27,495
- Mr. President.
-<i> Edgar,</i>

1266
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,731
the governor
of Mississippi

1267
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:33,168
wants the FBI to look
into these missing kids.

1268
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,070
Well, I'd be happy to,
Mr. President,

1269
01:09:36,173 --> 01:09:37,739
but there's
a jurisdictional problem.

1270
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,308
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
how to run your shop,

1271
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:44,045
but, uh, the governor
asked specifically

1272
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,214
for the FBI
to investigate.

1273
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:50,318
I tried to put him off,
but, uh, well, I suppose

1274
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,454
I can get
some third party involved.

1275
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:55,223
I know Senator
Jim Eastland

1276
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:56,958
wants Allen Dulles
investigating.

1277
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,694
CIA? Oh, no,
Mr. President,

1278
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:02,030
I don't think Dulles
is a good idea.

1279
01:10:02,132 --> 01:10:04,999
This is very clearly
an FBI matter.

1280
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:07,335
<i>Well, if you're sure.</i>

1281
01:10:07,437 --> 01:10:10,071
<i>I mean, the last thing</i>
<i>I would want</i>

1282
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:13,775
<i>is Dulles down there</i> <i>acting like
he was running</i> <i>the FBI as well.</i>

1283
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:17,612
I'll tell you what, let's
say Eastland is my problem.

1284
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:18,880
I'll just deal with him.

1285
01:10:18,982 --> 01:10:21,082
You get your agents down there
to Neshoba County

1286
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,418
and you just wrap this
thing up quick, you hear?

1287
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,920
When did you talk
to Eastland

1288
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,989
about Dulles
going down there?

1289
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:30,592
Oh, I made that part up.

1290
01:10:30,694 --> 01:10:34,963
The problem here is there's
three sovereignties involved.

1291
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,031
There's the United States,

1292
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:40,034
there's the state
of Mississippi,

1293
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:43,304
and then there's
J. Edgar Hoover.

1294
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:54,082
Reporter: <i>The burned-out station
wagon</i> <i>was discovered in the woods</i>

1295
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:56,284
<i>20 miles from Philadelphia,</i>
<i>Mississippi,</i>

1296
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:59,087
<i>a small town</i> <i>in which
Schwerner,</i> <i>Goodman, and Chaney</i>

1297
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:01,589
<i>had been arrested for speeding</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

1298
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:04,225
<i>They were released</i> <i>late at
night by</i> <i>a deputy sheriff</i>

1299
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,795
<i>and were last seen driving away</i>
<i>in the blue station wagon.</i>

1300
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:11,132
- We have to assume those young
men are dead. - Wilkins: Mm-hmm.

1301
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:13,101
There were no bodies
in the car they found.

1302
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:16,671
Oh, well, then they're probably
on vacation, huh, Mr. Wilkins?

1303
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,007
I mean, I always
set my car on fire

1304
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,675
before taking
a weekend off.

1305
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,411
How many voters
have you actually registered?

1306
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:29,550
- 1,200, give or take.
- Hmm.

1307
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:32,553
500 beaten and arrested,
35 churches burned,

1308
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:34,555
30 Negro homes
and businesses

1309
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:38,259
dynamited
for 1,200 votes.

1310
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,261
It's not just
about the votes.

1311
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:43,865
For the first time, black people
are building a new political party.

1312
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,734
- The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, I heard.
- Carmichael:<i> Hold on.</i>

1313
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:49,203
We tried to play
by the rules

1314
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,774
of the regular Democrat
Party, but they kept us out.

1315
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:57,478
Fine. So we built our own Democrat
Party, but with a difference.

1316
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,348
Open to everybody,
white or Negro.

1317
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,651
Well, don't you think that America ought
to have at least one political party

1318
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,453
- that isn't racist?
- It's a waste of time.

1319
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:08,323
We send our delegates
to the convention

1320
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:09,924
where they challenge
the legality

1321
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:12,927
of the segregated Mississippi
delegation on national TV

1322
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:17,799
- and dare L.B.J.
- not to seat us.

1323
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,202
Children playing
with dynamite.

1324
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:24,105
Are you so desperate
for their approval

1325
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,442
that you would sanction
this mass suicide?

1326
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:30,211
Those young men
went down to Mississippi

1327
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:33,815
and died doing the work the
government hasn't been willing to do

1328
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:36,384
for a hundred years.

1329
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,753
We've got
to take a stand.

1330
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:46,294
I grieve
for those young men.

1331
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,863
Don't use
their funeral pyre

1332
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:51,499
to burn what's left
of the movement.

1333
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:01,209
How can I help, Bob?

1334
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:03,678
- Come to Mississippi.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1335
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,647
Show the people that you are
behind the Mississippi Freedom-

1336
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,350
You might as well
paint a target on his back

1337
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:10,718
and declare open season.

1338
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,287
Martin, you have not
been to Mississippi

1339
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,089
- in over a year.
- Abernathy:<i> He's been busy.</i>

1340
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:17,725
Death threats,
jail, shot at.

1341
01:13:17,827 --> 01:13:22,230
- You don't own a monopoly over
suffering- - And I never said that I did.

1342
01:13:22,332 --> 01:13:24,632
Let somebody else
carry this one, Martin.

1343
01:13:26,336 --> 01:13:28,102
<i>Please.</i>

1344
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:38,112
Of course I'll come.

1345
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:42,250
Jenkins: <i>FBI was acting on a tip
about</i> <i>a farm in rural Mississippi</i>

1346
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:45,386
<i>and they just found</i> <i>two bodies
buried there</i> <i>in an earthen dam.</i>

1347
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:48,122
Jesus.
Are they sure it's them?

1348
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,191
Schwerner's draft card
in his back pocket.

1349
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:52,326
Goodman's body
right below his.

1350
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:55,196
It appears they had both
been shot once in the chest.

1351
01:13:55,298 --> 01:13:57,098
And they're
still digging for Chaney.

1352
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,500
God damn.

1353
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:01,569
Bless those boys.

1354
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:05,606
The minute McNamara
gets here, you send him in.

1355
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:11,212
Gentlemen, we need to pick up
this conversation some other time.

1356
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:13,347
I'm sorry.

1357
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:17,819
It's obvious that
this Deputy Price

1358
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,020
was involved in that.

1359
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,788
Probably
the sheriff, too.

1360
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,256
Oh, Lord.

1361
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:25,626
- Well, this whole mess
is in my lap now.

1362
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:28,196
If I don't charge
these bastards,

1363
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:31,199
then King yells and I'm letting
them get away with murder.

1364
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:34,402
But if I do charge them,
then all the Southerners scream

1365
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:36,704
about how I'm taking orders
from the Negroes,

1366
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,274
and all this two weeks before the
start of the goddamn convention.

1367
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:42,510
Mr. President, I'm sorry
to have to tell you,

1368
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,111
but the word is
Governor Wallace

1369
01:14:44,214 --> 01:14:45,580
has offered himself
to Goldwater

1370
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:49,050
as the Republican vice
presidential candidate.

1371
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,952
That little weasel

1372
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:53,221
would sell his mother
to get a leg up.

1373
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:56,991
And Strom Thurmond
is formally switching parties.

1374
01:14:57,093 --> 01:14:58,860
That motherfucker!

1375
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:00,862
<i>Is anybody</i>
<i>gonna follow him?</i>

1376
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:03,364
- Well, I don't know.
- Well, find out.

1377
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:06,300
- You bet I will.
- God damn it.

1378
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:15,776
You see her on TV?

1379
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:18,579
- Who?
- Oh, the-

1380
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,516
the dead kid's wife,
Schwerner.

1381
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,985
Uh, Rita, Rita.

1382
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:27,154
Wife.
Widow, I mean.

1383
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:28,456
Christ.

1384
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:30,291
Terrible.

1385
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:33,427
- - Mr. President,
we have word.

1386
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:37,431
No, no. Come on.

1387
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:40,568
Yeah. Sit there.

1388
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,571
All right, Robert.

1389
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:46,340
Captain Herrick
of the USS Maddox

1390
01:15:46,442 --> 01:15:48,976
reports a potential
sighting last night

1391
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:53,748
of two possibly hostile unidentified
vessels in the Gulf of Tonkin

1392
01:15:53,850 --> 01:15:56,951
and some somewhat
contradictory sonar evidence

1393
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:58,853
of actual
torpedo attack.

1394
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,957
Wh- a potential sighting?

1395
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:05,326
What the hell's
a potential sighting?

1396
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:08,663
A visual sighting not
confirmed by mechanical means.

1397
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:12,767
And this torpedo attack,
this actually happened?

1398
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,970
Still awaiting
confirmation.

1399
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:19,273
Well, were any
of our ships hit?

1400
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,675
No, sir.

1401
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:24,211
-<i> Were there any explosions?</i>
- No, sir.

1402
01:16:24,314 --> 01:16:27,448
Then how the hell do we know
we were attacked?

1403
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,717
We don't, for sure.

1404
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,254
We have contradictory
sonar readings.

1405
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:35,089
For God's sakes, Robert.

1406
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,224
Give me something
I could work with here.

1407
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:42,029
Officially, this is
a very delicate subject.

1408
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,299
Oh, Humphrey can know.

1409
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:48,269
Mr. President,

1410
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:50,538
the limited air strikes
you ordered preselected

1411
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,341
- in case of another attack are good to go.
- Air strikes?

1412
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:56,143
- Shall we order them in?
- Surely, this is a situation

1413
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,512
about which we ought to be
more confident before we act.

1414
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:02,283
There's no sense in pretending last
night's event didn't happen, not anymore.

1415
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:05,419
- What do you mean?
- There's been a leak somewhere.

1416
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:08,823
- Who? Who leaked it?
- We're tracking it down.

1417
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:10,658
I want his fucking head
in a basket!

1418
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,762
The point is the press
has got to it somehow.

1419
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,497
God damn it!

1420
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:20,034
Now there are domestic
considerations as well.

1421
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,936
Yeah, Goldwater.

1422
01:17:22,038 --> 01:17:24,338
Don't retaliate.

1423
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,307
He will play all the angles against you.

1424
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:30,311
All this "soft on military" bullshit.

1425
01:17:30,413 --> 01:17:33,114
Christ, the Democrats
beat Hitler and Tojo.

1426
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,582
What more
do we have to do?

1427
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:36,550
You want me to call in
the retaliatory strikes?

1428
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:39,487
For an attack which may
or may not have happened?

1429
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:41,155
Planes are ready to go
on your command.

1430
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,491
Mr. President, this puts you
in a terrible position.

1431
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:46,527
- You are essentially going to have to lie.
- Mr. President!

1432
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,905
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

1433
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:01,542
If it gets out,

1434
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:04,145
we'll pass it off on
our South Vietnamese allies.

1435
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:06,881
- Mr. President- - What,
you think I like this?!

1436
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:09,283
Putting my ass in a sling
this close to the election?

1437
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:11,852
- Sir- - Or maybe you think
Goldwater ought to be president.

1438
01:18:11,954 --> 01:18:13,187
- Is that it?
- I never said that.

1439
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,022
That maniac wants
to lob an A-bomb

1440
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,725
into the Kremlin's bathroom
and start World War III.

1441
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:20,194
- You see how you like that.
- Mr. President, come on.

1442
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:23,064
If Goldwater gets elected,
you can forget about poverty.

1443
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:26,434
You can forget about civil
rights. Is that what you want?

1444
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:28,836
Now, I'm trying
to turn this country around

1445
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:31,639
and prevent a major war!

1446
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:33,607
Christ, why the hell

1447
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,977
did I ever consider you
for my vice president?

1448
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,449
First sign of trouble,
you cut and run.

1449
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:44,952
I'm not running anywhere,
Mr. President.

1450
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,555
I'm standing
right here beside you.

1451
01:18:47,657 --> 01:18:51,425
Precious
cold comfort you are.

1452
01:18:53,463 --> 01:18:56,197
You know, Congress
is gonna back me on this.

1453
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:59,133
It's election year.

1454
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:03,237
I'll get them to pass
some kind of resolution

1455
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:05,406
authorizing me
full authority over there.

1456
01:19:05,508 --> 01:19:08,375
Then we can get back
to things that really matter.

1457
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:11,345
- Jenkins:<i> Sir?</i>
- What?

1458
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:14,715
They found
Chaney's body.

1459
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,924
God damn it.

James Chaney
gave his life

1474

to make this country live up
to its forgotten promises

1475
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:36,263
and unfulfilled ideals.

1476
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,866

- Congregation:<i> No.</i>
- We will continue

1482
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:58,219
to respond to their violence
with love and forgiveness.

1483
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:00,120

<i>Amen.</i>

...I not only blame

1487

the people
who pulled the trigger

1488
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:14,602
or dug the hole
with the shovel.

1489
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:18,739
I blame the state
of Mississippi...

1490

all the way on up

1491
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,177
to the people in Washington
for what happened.

1492
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,347
- Now, that's enough of that!
- No.

1493
01:21:26,449 --> 01:21:28,215
It's all right.

1494
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:30,251
Come on up here.

1495
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:35,990
I'm sick and tired

1496
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:38,459
of going to funerals
for black men

1497
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:42,630
- who have been murdered by white men.
- Congregation: Yes.

1498
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:44,832
- Are you?
- Congregation: Yes!

1499
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:47,201
Are you sick and tired
of this stuff like I am?

1500
01:21:47,303 --> 01:21:49,136
Congregation:
Yes!

1501
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,772
I'm not feeling sad
tonight, Dr. King.

1502
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,610
I'm not feeling
forgiveness.

1503
01:21:56,712 --> 01:21:58,846
Woman:
<i>Preach.</i>

1504
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:01,548
I've got vengeance
in my heart.

1505
01:22:02,818 --> 01:22:05,419
And I'm asking you
to feel angry with me.

1506
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,354
- Congregation: Yes.
- Are you angry?

1507
01:22:07,456 --> 01:22:12,126
- Yes!
- The white men who murdered James Chaney

1508
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:13,594
are never
gonna be punished.

1509
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:15,496
Congregation:
<i>That's right.</i>

1510
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:20,634
The best way
to remember James Chaney

1511
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:23,704
is to demand our rights.

1512
01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:25,572
If you go back home
and take

1513
01:22:25,675 --> 01:22:29,209
what these white men
are doing to us...

1514
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:34,682
if you take it and don't
do something about it,

1515
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:36,817
then God damn
your souls!

1516
01:22:36,919 --> 01:22:39,086
<i> Stand up!</i>

1517
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:42,756
We got to stand up
in Meridian!

1518
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:46,226
- Congregation: Yeah!
- We got to stand up in Jackson!

1519
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:47,561
Congregation:
Stand up!

1520
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:49,396
And when we get
to Atlantic City,

1521
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:52,199
- what are we going to do?
- Stand up!

1522
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,535
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

1523
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,003
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

1524
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:58,138
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

1525
01:22:58,240 --> 01:22:59,873
Stand up! Stand up!

1526
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:01,742
Stand up! Stand up!

1527
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,711
Stand up!
Stand up!

1528
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:07,414
<i>One man, one vote!</i>
<i>One man, one vote!</i>

1529
01:23:12,588 --> 01:23:14,221
You must seat the MFDP.

1530
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:17,758
- Martin, it's- it's not
that simple. - Yes, it is.

1531
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:21,428
Now, you don't understand the
depth of feeling among my people.

1532
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,365
These murders, they've
rocked the movement.

1533
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:27,868
If the government does not
do what is right here,

1534
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,771
nonviolence will no longer
be an option.

1535
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:37,144
Reporter: <i>You can see a
largely</i> <i>Negro delegation</i>

1536
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:39,046
<i>from a Southern state</i>

1537
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:41,181
<i>claiming to be</i>
<i>an alternative delegation.</i>

1538
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:44,451
It's something I don't think has
happened in the Democratic Convention

1539
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,587
perhaps since
Reconstruction days.

1540
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,490
And according to the Freedom
Democratic representatives,

1541
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:51,625
<i>Dr. Henry, who is</i>
<i>their chairman,</i>

1542
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:55,195
Dr. Martin Luther King, they are
not going to accept any compromise

1543
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,898
short of having some kind
of a vote in this convention.

1544
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,069
Well, I'll certainly take that
under consideration, John.

1545
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:05,005
Reporter: ...this delegation
being seated, and the other...

1546
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:07,508
John Connally, the
governor of my own state,

1547
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,878
just told me, "You seat
those black buggers,

1548
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:12,613
not only
will Texas quit,

1549
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,448
but the whole South
will walk out."

1550
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,618
We might as well kiss the
whole goddamn election good-bye.

1551
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,486
What the hell
do you want?

1552
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,088
The ballot
in Alabama, sir,

1553
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:23,223
apparently, Governor Wallace
kept your name off it.

1554
01:24:23,325 --> 01:24:25,492
That little piece of shit.

1555
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:28,729
- Can he do that?
- Of course he can.

1556
01:24:28,831 --> 01:24:31,832
Goldwater must be
laughing his ass off.

1557
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:34,034
<i>And now they're</i>
<i>just threatening</i>

1558
01:24:34,136 --> 01:24:36,336

- Lyndon,

1560
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:43,343
why don't you take a break
from this for a while?

1561
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:44,945
Oh, I'm fine, Bird.

1562
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:47,614
Well, you certainly
don't sound fine.

1563
01:24:47,716 --> 01:24:51,285
- When's the last time you ate anything?
- Go away, Bird.

1564
01:24:51,387 --> 01:24:52,553
You're giving me
a goddamn headache.

1565
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:54,154
Well, honey,
I'm just worried.

1566
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,156
Would you leave me alone?!

1567
01:24:56,258 --> 01:24:58,025
Go on,
get out of here!

1568
01:24:58,127 --> 01:25:00,727

Oh.

1572

Thank you.

1573
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,289
Oh.

1574
01:25:29,391 --> 01:25:31,058
I feel so sorry for him.

1575
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,526
I know.

1576
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,195
Thank God
he has you, Walter.

1577
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,931
And you.

1578
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,070
You think
he's hard on me?

1579
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:45,973
Well, he's hard
on everybody,

1580
01:25:46,075 --> 01:25:48,108
especially himself.

1581
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:50,310
People don't see that.

1582
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:52,412
But I do.

1583
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:54,848
I see everything.

1584
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:57,684
His lady friends.

1585
01:26:01,023 --> 01:26:03,790
But I'm the one
he chose, huh?

1586
01:26:03,893 --> 01:26:06,226
At the end of the day.

1587
01:26:08,063 --> 01:26:10,731
I'm the one
he comes home to.

1588
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,340
My money paid for his first
campaign, did you know that?

1589
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:21,975
I had to face down
my own daddy

1590
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:25,646
over my inheritance
to get it.

1591
01:26:25,748 --> 01:26:27,414
By God,

1592
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:31,118
it was the best investment
I ever made.

1593
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:37,324
My lipstick okay?

1594
01:26:37,426 --> 01:26:39,159
You look beautiful.

1595
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:41,762
No, I'm not.

1596
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:45,265
But you make do
with what you got.

1597
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:47,301
And whatever happens,

1598
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:49,770
you don't quit.

Reporter: <i>CBS News correspondent</i>

<i>at the ballroom</i>

1601
01:26:57,012 --> 01:26:58,745

1602

of the Democratic National
Party are in session.

1603
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,516
And now we are hearing

1604
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:05,819
from the Freedom Democratic Party
representatives of Mississippi.

1605
01:27:05,921 --> 01:27:09,189
Just tell the credential
committee what happened

1606
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,091
in Mississippi,
Miss Hamer.

1607
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:37,084
On January 9th, 1963,
I went to a meeting

1608
01:27:37,186 --> 01:27:40,721
to learn how to register
Negro voters in Mississippi.

1609
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:44,224
On my way back,

1610
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:47,060
I was arrested
by the Winona police chief

1611
01:27:47,162 --> 01:27:50,163
and taken
to the county jail.

1612
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:54,501
After I was placed
in a cell,

1613
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:57,304
state highway patrolmen

1614
01:27:57,406 --> 01:28:01,208
ordered me to lay facedown
on the bunk bed saying...

1615
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:06,146
"You're gonna wish
you was dead."

1616
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:08,715
Now who the hell is this?

1617
01:28:08,817 --> 01:28:12,286
Humphrey: <i>Fannie Lou Hamer,</i>
<i>a sharecropper's daughter.</i>

1618
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:14,888
Became one of the leaders of the MFDP.

1619
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,423
For Christ's sakes.

1620
01:28:16,525 --> 01:28:19,726
And then he ordered...

1621
01:28:20,996 --> 01:28:24,498
two male Negro prisoners

1622
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,200
to beat me
with a blackjack.

1623
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,405
The first prisoner

1624
01:28:31,507 --> 01:28:35,542
beat me till he was
exhausted.

1625
01:28:37,346 --> 01:28:42,282
And then a patrolman ordered
the second Negro to beat me.

1626
01:28:44,286 --> 01:28:48,155
- This is awful.
- It sure as hell is.

1627
01:28:48,257 --> 01:28:51,458
She could stampede the liberals
into seating the MFDP

1628
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,394
and the South will storm out
of the convention in droves.

1629
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,029
<i>Walter!</i>

1630
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:57,564
Walter,
you tell the press

1631
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,766
we got a major announcement
in the Rose Garden.

1632
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:02,803
- What's the announcement?
- Hell if I know!

1633
01:29:02,905 --> 01:29:06,873
Anything to turn off those
goddamn cameras in Atlantic City.

1634
01:29:06,975 --> 01:29:11,111
I began to scream...

1635
01:29:12,214 --> 01:29:16,917
and one white man
hit me in my head

1636
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,486
and told me to hush.

1637
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:26,560
My dress had worked up high,
so I pulled it down.

1638
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:30,330
And another white man
walked over

1639
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:32,632
and pulled it back up.

1640
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:41,041
All this...

1641
01:29:41,143 --> 01:29:44,945
on account
of we wanna register

1642
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:47,581
to vote.

1643
01:29:50,285 --> 01:29:52,753
And if the Freedom
Democratic Party

1644
01:29:52,855 --> 01:29:55,589
is not seated
at this convention,

1645
01:29:55,691 --> 01:29:58,592
I question America.

1646
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:01,294
Is this America?

1647
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:06,266
The land of the free
and the home of the brave

1648
01:30:06,368 --> 01:30:08,969
where our lives
be threatened daily

1649
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:13,840
'cause we wanna live
as decent human beings.

1650
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:16,576
<i>All we're asking</i>

1651
01:30:16,678 --> 01:30:18,345
is fair representation

1652
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:20,180
of this...

1653
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,617
The president is going
to announce his address

1654
01:30:23,719 --> 01:30:25,852
at the White House
in just a few moments.

1655
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:30,524
Announcer:<i> Please</i> <i>stand by for the
President</i> <i>of the United States.</i>

1656
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:34,261
Uh, howdy.

1657
01:30:34,363 --> 01:30:36,530
-<i> First of all,</i> <i>I wanna thank y'all...</i>
- I don't understand.

1658
01:30:36,632 --> 01:30:39,065
- What's going on?
- It appears, Miss Hamer,

1659
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:41,001
we've been preempted
by the president.

1660
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:44,271
-<i> I know a lot</i> <i>of people are...</i>
- Come on.

1661
01:30:44,373 --> 01:30:46,907
still wondering

1662
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:51,511
who my vice presidential
candidate

1663
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:53,146
will be.

1664
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:55,549
And we'll make that decision
very, very soon,

1665
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:56,883
I promise you that.

1666
01:30:56,985 --> 01:30:58,752
<i>I think now</i>
<i>I can open it up</i>

1667
01:30:58,854 --> 01:31:01,755
<i>and if you'd like to ask</i>
<i>a few questions, uh...</i>

1668
01:31:01,857 --> 01:31:03,957
I need to know
everything that King

1669
01:31:04,059 --> 01:31:05,792
and that Fannie Lou person
and Bob Moses

1670
01:31:05,894 --> 01:31:09,696
and all those goddamn people
in the MFDP are talking about.

1671
01:31:09,798 --> 01:31:12,332
I want them under constant
surveillance, the whole bunch of them.

1672
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:14,901
Mr. President, we don't
have any warrant.

1673
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:20,540
Well, that never stopped
you before, did it?

1674
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:24,211
Now, I don't care
what you do

1675
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,479
or how you do it.

1676
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:28,048
In fact, it's better
if I don't know.

1677
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:31,885
But everything you get, you
send it immediately to Walter.

1678
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:35,055
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1679
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:45,532
- Uncle Dick.
- You're up awful late, Mr. President.

1680
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:47,701
You're gonna give yourself
another heart attack.

1681
01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:50,203
<i>Well, if I do,</i>
<i>it'll be the Dixiecrats</i>

1682
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:52,606
<i>and Martin Luther King</i>
<i>put me in my grave.</i>

1683
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:56,276
You hear of this
public telegram of King's

1684
01:31:56,378 --> 01:31:59,980
demanding that I seat
the MFDP?

1685
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:01,681
The whole country
will think

1686
01:32:01,783 --> 01:32:04,751
that Negroes have more power
in the Democratic Party

1687
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,219
than the president has,

1688
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:08,088
and the whole South
will bolt.

1689
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,090
I warned you
about that.

1690
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,592
You know what I think?

1691
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:15,695
I think this is something
that King cooked up

1692
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:17,364
with Bobby Kennedy
to embarrass me.

1693
01:32:17,466 --> 01:32:21,401
Now, listen, Kennedy is
gonna stab me in the back

1694
01:32:21,503 --> 01:32:24,004
<i>and steal this nomination</i>
<i>at the last minute.</i>

1695
01:32:24,106 --> 01:32:27,474
Mr. President, Robert Kennedy
has no interest whatsoever

1696
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:29,843
in hurting you
or helping Barry Goldwater.

1697
01:32:29,945 --> 01:32:32,946
Then the hell
with them all.

1698
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:35,048
I'm gonna go back home
to my ranch

1699
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,750
and the people
who love me.

1700
01:32:36,852 --> 01:32:39,519
<i>I never wanted to be president</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

1701
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:41,454
Mr. President,
forgive my frankness,

1702
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:43,957
but you are speaking
like a spoiled child.

1703
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,293
You and I both know
you're not serious.

1704
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:48,962
Now take a tranquilizer,
go to sleep.

1705
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,506
Thank you.

1706
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:08,481
I walked into the lion's
den, I argued fervently,

1707
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:10,050
I used all
the heartstrings I had.

1708
01:33:10,152 --> 01:33:11,718
I made no headway.

1709
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,553
God damn it.

1710
01:33:13,655 --> 01:33:17,324
The least the MFDP
might be willing to accept

1711
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:19,392
would be
some actual votes

1712
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:21,361
at the convention,
a few votes.

1713
01:33:21,463 --> 01:33:22,829
Well, what did King say?

1714
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,632
He's very supportive
of their leadership on this.

1715
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:28,568
After everything I did for him,
he should've stood up for me!

1716
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,870
Why didn't somebody
stand up for me?

1717
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,739
I stood up for you,
Mr. President.

1718
01:33:32,841 --> 01:33:35,208
Somebody who matters.

1719
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:38,745
Well, if you don't think
my loyalty is important-

1720
01:33:38,847 --> 01:33:43,116
Jesus, you are
so thin-skinned.

1721
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:45,585
Shit.

1722
01:33:45,687 --> 01:33:49,089
I depend on you, Hubert,
you know that.

1723
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:52,892
Christ's sakes, there's
got to be a solution here.

1724
01:33:54,663 --> 01:33:56,363
Well, maybe we can get

1725
01:33:56,465 --> 01:34:00,533
one or two of the Mississippi
regulars to agree to step aside.

1726
01:34:00,636 --> 01:34:03,203
They claim
they're sick or something.

1727
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,339
All right.

1728
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:09,275
You tell them
that they can have

1729
01:34:09,378 --> 01:34:11,277
two voting delegates.

1730
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:14,981
We'll- we'll call them,
uh, at large delegates.

1731
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:18,318
- But one of them has to be that white minister of theirs.
- Reverend Edwin King.

1732
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,919
That's him, that's him.

1733
01:34:20,022 --> 01:34:22,889
That way, it's one white
man and only one Negro.

1734
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,691
We'll integrate
their delegation.

1735
01:34:24,793 --> 01:34:26,493
Who can argue
with that, huh?

1736
01:34:26,595 --> 01:34:28,061
I'll see what I can do.

1737
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:31,464
Well, don't see
what you can do!

1738
01:34:31,566 --> 01:34:34,734
You do
what I tell you to do.

1739
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:38,271
Mr. President.

1740
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,477
What you think
of Hubert?

1741
01:34:44,579 --> 01:34:48,181
I think he's working
as hard as he can.

1742
01:34:48,283 --> 01:34:49,949
Yeah.

1743
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:52,052
He's nice.

1744
01:34:54,489 --> 01:34:57,757
Nice is what you call
a gal with no tits,

1745
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:00,026
no ass,
and no personality.

1746
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:02,429
<i>Nice is</i>
<i>for kissing babies.</i>

1747
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:06,733
There's no place for nice
in a knife fight.

1748
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,172
You get me
Walter Reuther.

1749
01:35:12,274 --> 01:35:14,474
Mr. President,
what a pleasant surprise.

1750
01:35:14,576 --> 01:35:16,810
Johnson: <i>Well, Reuther,</i>
<i>I know how important</i>

1751
01:35:16,912 --> 01:35:18,812
<i>your golden boy Humphrey</i>
<i>is to you</i>

1752
01:35:18,914 --> 01:35:20,780
<i>and the rest</i>
<i>of organized labor.</i>

1753
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:24,517
But if this
big delegate war comes off

1754
01:35:24,619 --> 01:35:27,287
and the South walks out
of the convention,

1755
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:30,290
<i>he will have</i>
<i>no future</i>

1756
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:32,425
<i>in the Democratic Party,</i>
<i>you hear me?</i>

1757
01:35:32,527 --> 01:35:33,693
Yes, sir, but I-
I really must-

1758
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:35,395
Now, you need
to tighten your leash

1759
01:35:35,497 --> 01:35:39,799
and bring King and the
MFDP in line or by God,

1760
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:41,634
Hubert Humphrey
is never gonna be

1761
01:35:41,737 --> 01:35:43,803
my vice president
or anything else!

1762
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:46,773
- Sir, I- - He won't be able
to get elected dogcatcher

1763
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:49,876
and you won't have nobody in the
Senate to carry water for you.

1764
01:35:49,978 --> 01:35:51,878
Now you get yourself down
to Atlantic City

1765
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:54,047
and fix this mess,
and I mean now!

1766
01:36:03,024 --> 01:36:04,557
Are you all right, sir?

1767
01:36:06,995 --> 01:36:09,963
I do not have the hide
of a rhinoceros.

1768
01:36:11,299 --> 01:36:13,700
<i>You know me, Walter.</i>

1769
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,137
I have a genuine desire
to unite people,

1770
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,038
but my own people
in the South,

1771
01:36:19,141 --> 01:36:20,707
they're against me
and the-

1772
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:23,543
the North is against me and
the Negroes are against me

1773
01:36:23,645 --> 01:36:27,147
and the press sure doesn't
have any damn affection for me.

1774
01:36:27,249 --> 01:36:30,016
It's not fair, sir,
not with all you've done.

1775
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,485
I could drop dead
tomorrow

1776
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:35,922
and there wouldn't be 10
people who'd shed a tear.

1777
01:36:36,024 --> 01:36:38,091
Oh, no. No, sir.
That's not true, sir.

1778
01:36:38,193 --> 01:36:40,326
Oh, the hell it ain't.

1779
01:36:43,832 --> 01:36:47,000
People turn on you
so fast.

1780
01:36:50,672 --> 01:36:53,907
When my daddy
lost everything...

1781
01:36:54,943 --> 01:36:57,143
people who had been
glad-handing him,

1782
01:36:57,245 --> 01:37:02,382
they just treated him
like dog shit.

1783
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:09,222
They humiliated him

1784
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:11,090
to his face...

1785
01:37:12,694 --> 01:37:14,527
in public.

1786
01:37:19,968 --> 01:37:22,202
And my mother...

1787
01:37:26,107 --> 01:37:29,209
the way she'd
freeze him out.

1788
01:37:34,616 --> 01:37:37,417
That's what killed him.

1789
01:37:45,393 --> 01:37:48,094
You know
what I think it is?

1790
01:37:50,332 --> 01:37:53,633
People think
I want great power...

1791
01:37:55,503 --> 01:37:57,437
but what I want

1792
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,739
is great solace.

1793
01:38:02,444 --> 01:38:04,444
A little love.

1794
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:08,281
That's all I want.

1795
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:16,089
You have that
from us, sir.

1796
01:38:16,191 --> 01:38:18,091
From me.

1797
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,401
Poor Marjorie
must be wondering

1798
01:38:28,503 --> 01:38:30,436
where the hell you are.

1799
01:38:30,538 --> 01:38:33,640
- Oh, she understands.
- Jesus.

1800
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:38,511
How many kids you got again?
What is it, five?

1801
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:40,380
- Six.
- Six.

1802
01:38:40,482 --> 01:38:43,449
Two girls and four boys.

1803
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:46,853
Right, Catholic.

1804
01:38:52,961 --> 01:38:55,695
I always wanted a son.

1805
01:38:55,797 --> 01:38:56,829
Don't get me wrong,

1806
01:38:56,932 --> 01:39:00,333
I- I love Luci
and Lynda, but...

1807
01:39:02,404 --> 01:39:04,904
a man wants a son.

1808
01:39:11,246 --> 01:39:13,046
I reckon...

1809
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:16,182
you're as close to that
as I've got.

1810
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,064
Oh, Walter,

1811
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:33,166
you'll be
right outside?

1812
01:39:33,268 --> 01:39:35,768
Yes, sir.

1813
01:39:49,718 --> 01:39:51,584
Reuther:
<i>Martin.</i>

1814
01:39:51,686 --> 01:39:53,987
Mr. Reuther.

1815
01:39:54,089 --> 01:39:55,788
Didn't expect
to see you here.

1816
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:58,157
Well, neither did I.

1817
01:39:58,259 --> 01:40:00,293
I got a call
from the president

1818
01:40:00,395 --> 01:40:03,629
with a generous helping
of the Texas twist.

1819
01:40:03,732 --> 01:40:05,932
You've got to get
the MFDP to compromise.

1820
01:40:06,034 --> 01:40:08,334
Well, what the president
offered was an insult.

1821
01:40:08,436 --> 01:40:10,536
These people have shed
their blood-

1822
01:40:10,638 --> 01:40:13,106
Martin, your funding
is on the line.

1823
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:15,341
You've gotta get
the MFDP on board

1824
01:40:15,443 --> 01:40:17,577
or there will be no more
union money for the movement,

1825
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:19,479
not a single
goddamn dime.

1826
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:22,982
You would sabotage the entire
civil rights movement over this?

1827
01:40:23,084 --> 01:40:24,417
No, you would.

1828
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,552
The number of delegates at a
convention, who gives a shit?

1829
01:40:26,654 --> 01:40:29,722
- It's wrong.
- Look, there will be a final offer.

1830
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,724
You get your people
to accept it

1831
01:40:31,826 --> 01:40:34,027
or you can take your tin cup
and your principles

1832
01:40:34,129 --> 01:40:37,330
out onto the street and
see how far that gets you.

1833
01:40:49,177 --> 01:40:53,646
L.B.J.! L.B.J.!

1834
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:57,984
Announcer: Will the
delegates please be seated?

1835
01:41:00,055 --> 01:41:01,788
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

1836
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:03,423
- When do we want it?
- Now!

1837
01:41:03,525 --> 01:41:05,558
- What do we want?
- Freedom!

1838
01:41:05,660 --> 01:41:07,894
- When do we want it?
- Now!

1839
01:41:07,996 --> 01:41:11,798
♪ Which side are you on?
Everybody, now ♪

1840
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,401
All: ♪ Which side
are you on, Lord? ♪

1841
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:18,638
Hamer: ♪ Which side are
you on? Everybody, now ♪

1842
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:22,775
- Martin. Just...
- ♪ Which side are you on, Lord? ♪

1843
01:41:22,877 --> 01:41:25,178
- ♪ Which side are you on? ♪
- I want everyone to hear this.

1844
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,015
I'm pleased to say that we've come
up with a mighty fine compromise.

1845
01:41:29,117 --> 01:41:31,184
The MFDP will get
two voting delegates-

1846
01:41:31,286 --> 01:41:32,952
Aaron Henry
and Edwin King.

1847
01:41:33,054 --> 01:41:37,490
And the Democratic Party will
adopt a formal rules change

1848
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:40,927
to prohibit any segregated
delegation in the future.

1849
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:42,395
This is a major victory.

1850
01:41:42,497 --> 01:41:44,797
Senator Humphrey, God did
not send us to Atlantic City

1851
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:46,566
- for no two seats.
- Moses:<i> That's right.</i>

1852
01:41:46,668 --> 01:41:47,733
When all of us is tired.

1853
01:41:47,836 --> 01:41:49,702
This is just like
the white plantation bosses

1854
01:41:49,804 --> 01:41:52,238
making all the decisions
for his black sharecroppers.

1855
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,773
Hold on, Bob.

1856
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:56,542
You've won your case
in the court of public opinion.

1857
01:41:56,644 --> 01:41:58,244
Now you've got

1858
01:41:58,346 --> 01:42:00,480
- Token?!
- Don't twist my words, Aaron.

1859
01:42:00,582 --> 01:42:04,083
What I am saying is that
there's a whole lot at stake here

1860
01:42:04,185 --> 01:42:06,052
and this is a necessary
political compromise.

1861
01:42:06,154 --> 01:42:08,521
We are not here to bring
politics to our morality.

1862
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:11,157
We are here to bring our
morality to our politics.

1863
01:42:11,259 --> 01:42:14,160
Dr. King, what do you
think we ought to do?

1868
01:42:23,605 --> 01:42:26,272
But the solemn commitment

to end discrimination
in all future conventions

1870
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:31,677

- Yes, it is.

1871
01:42:31,779 --> 01:42:34,947
...in which the MFDP
can take real pride.

1872
01:42:35,049 --> 01:42:37,783
And as a Negro leader,
I'm asking-

1873
01:42:39,687 --> 01:42:42,655

Solomon himself

All the way with L.B.J.

1885
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:25,898
L.B.J. is not
the second coming.

1886
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,967
He's just like
every other politician.

1887
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:30,836
He'll do what it takes
to get elected.

1888
01:43:30,939 --> 01:43:33,472
But I think he really
wants civil rights.

1889
01:43:33,575 --> 01:43:36,809
Now, we've got
a chance here, Bob.

1890
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:38,477
A real chance.

1891
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:39,845
Best chance
in a hundred years

1892
01:43:39,948 --> 01:43:43,616

throw it away.

Carl, what the hell

1914
01:44:43,845 --> 01:44:47,513
Mr. President, you can't give
these people two seats.

1915
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:50,583
It's gonna look like the Negroes
are taking over the whole convention.

1916
01:44:50,685 --> 01:44:52,251
Oh, for Christ's sakes,

1917
01:44:52,353 --> 01:44:55,054
it's one Negro
and one white minister.

1918
01:44:55,156 --> 01:44:57,056
Now, it's the principle
of the thing.

1919
01:44:57,158 --> 01:44:59,859
Me and my delegates are
about inches from walking out.

1920
01:44:59,961 --> 01:45:01,627
In fact, the whole
South's about to bolt.

1921
01:45:01,729 --> 01:45:03,629
All right,
now let's you and me

1922
01:45:03,731 --> 01:45:05,197
understand something here.

1923
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:08,834
Those people are Democrats
just like you and me,

1924
01:45:08,936 --> 01:45:11,570
but those good old boys from
Mississippi, they locked them out.

1925
01:45:11,673 --> 01:45:13,239
Well, now,
they got locked out

1926
01:45:13,341 --> 01:45:14,573
because they're
not registered to vote.

1927
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:16,976
Because they wouldn't
let them register!

1928
01:45:17,078 --> 01:45:20,613
They beat them and shot them
and lynched them.

1929
01:45:20,715 --> 01:45:22,882
Well, now, you're tarring a lot
of people here, Mr. President.

1930
01:45:22,984 --> 01:45:25,818
No, Carl, Carl, you and I
just can't survive

1931
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,889
our modern political life with
these goddamn fellas down there

1932
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:34,493
doing things the old way and eating
them Negroes for breakfast every morning.

1933
01:45:34,595 --> 01:45:35,661
They got to quit that!

1934
01:45:35,763 --> 01:45:38,597
Mr. President,
you need to remove

1935
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,633
these so-called
delegates at large.

1936
01:45:40,735 --> 01:45:43,202
No, you listen to me!

1937
01:45:43,304 --> 01:45:45,705
You need to make up your mind
once and for all

1938
01:45:45,807 --> 01:45:48,007
what- what kind
of Christian you are.

1939
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:50,376
Are you
a once-a-week fella

1940
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:53,079
or do you hold the Word
in your heart?

1941
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:56,382
<i>And what kind</i>
<i>of politician are you?</i>

1942
01:45:56,484 --> 01:45:58,851
<i>You just</i>
<i>out for yourself</i>

1943
01:45:58,953 --> 01:46:02,188
<i>or you wanna make</i> <i>a better life
for all</i> <i>the people of Georgia?</i>

1944
01:46:02,290 --> 01:46:04,890
- Well, of course I- -<i> And what
kind</i> <i>of man are you?</i>

1945
01:46:04,992 --> 01:46:09,295
You got the balls to do
what you know is right

1946
01:46:09,397 --> 01:46:12,598
<i>or do you</i>
<i>just slink away?</i>

1947
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,801
Now, what you don't get to do
is threaten me.

1948
01:46:15,903 --> 01:46:17,703
So if you're gonna walk out
of the convention,

1949
01:46:17,805 --> 01:46:19,338
then you just do it
right now!

1950
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:21,507
<i>But if not,</i>

1951
01:46:21,609 --> 01:46:24,744
then I expect to see
your bright and shiny faces

1952
01:46:24,846 --> 01:46:28,314
wearing your big "All the way
with L.B.J." hats tonight

1953
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:30,282
when I take the stage.

1954
01:46:36,924 --> 01:46:39,125
Bird, go away
and leave me be.

1955
01:46:39,227 --> 01:46:41,427
I can't do that,
Lyndon.

1956
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:43,095
I won't.

1957
01:46:44,165 --> 01:46:46,499
You're just like
the rest of them.

1958
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:48,667
You're all against me.

1959
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:51,170
That is so not true.

1960
01:46:51,272 --> 01:46:54,140
- Oh, yeah?
- Look at me.

1961
01:46:55,009 --> 01:46:57,109
Look at me, Lyndon.

1962
01:47:00,314 --> 01:47:02,581
You are as brave a man

1963
01:47:02,683 --> 01:47:07,219
as FDR and Truman
and Lincoln.

1964
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:09,588
And there are
many, many people

1965
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:12,158
up there
at that convention

1966
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:14,160
and in this party

1967
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:17,930
and in this nation
who love you.

1968
01:47:18,032 --> 01:47:22,001
- And they are counting on you.
- I'm gonna resign.

1969
01:47:22,103 --> 01:47:24,136
- Let somebody else deal with this.
- You're not going to resign.

1970
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:25,738
- Yes, I am!
- No, you are not!

1971
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,474
- When your
great-grandmother... - Oh!

1972
01:47:28,576 --> 01:47:30,242
...was hiding
in the floorboards

1973
01:47:30,344 --> 01:47:33,379
while the Comanches
were raiding her house,

1974
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:35,314
did she flinch?

1975
01:47:35,416 --> 01:47:39,118
To step down now would
be wrong for your country.

1976
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:42,788
Your friends would be
frozen with embarrassment

1977
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:44,924
and your enemies
would jeer.

1978
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:48,494
Those bastards would love
to see me down.

1979
01:47:48,596 --> 01:47:50,529
And are you gonna
give them that pleasure?

1980
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:52,865
I don't think so.

1981
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:55,201
That is not
the man I married.

1982
01:47:55,303 --> 01:47:57,470
Sir, Governor Sanders
was just on TV

1983
01:47:57,572 --> 01:48:00,439
and the Georgia delegation's
not gonna walk out after all.

1984
01:48:01,709 --> 01:48:04,977
- What, Sanders backed down?
-<i> Yes, sir, he did.</i>

1985
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:09,548

01:49:45,413 --> 01:49:48,747
And as for the rest of you, what the
hell are you still standing here for?

2023
01:49:48,849 --> 01:49:50,783
Get out there
and do something!

2024
01:49:50,885 --> 01:49:51,850
Come on.

2025
01:49:51,953 --> 01:49:54,520
Not you, Humphrey.
Stay here.

2026
01:49:54,622 --> 01:49:59,291
You read this bullshit "Wall Street
Journal" exposé about my corruption?

2027
01:49:59,393 --> 01:50:01,694
Definitely planted
by Goldwater.

2028
01:50:01,796 --> 01:50:03,429
Damn right it was.

2029
01:50:03,531 --> 01:50:06,031
Take a look at this.

2030
01:50:06,133 --> 01:50:09,735
- Huh?
- That's disgusting.

2031
01:50:09,837 --> 01:50:12,605
Goldwater wants
to get down into the mud,

2032
01:50:12,707 --> 01:50:14,740
by God,
I could do that.

2033
01:50:14,842 --> 01:50:17,276
Listen here, I want you
to pull together

2034
01:50:17,378 --> 01:50:19,411
a special group
separate from the campaign

2035
01:50:19,513 --> 01:50:21,347
and hit him back
with everything we got!

2036
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:24,283
Mr. President, I don't think
sinking to their level is-

2037
01:50:24,385 --> 01:50:26,685
Oh, for God's sake,
just do it.

2038
01:50:26,787 --> 01:50:31,624
Mr. President, you are ahead in
the polls in most of the country.

2039
01:50:31,726 --> 01:50:34,460
Yeah, and so was
Nixon in '60.

2040
01:50:34,562 --> 01:50:36,929
And some people thought
he would've beat Jack

2041
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:38,964
except for a whole bunch
of dead people

2042
01:50:39,066 --> 01:50:41,100
voting in Chicago
at the last minute.

2043
01:50:41,202 --> 01:50:44,570
It ain't over
until it's over.

2044
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:49,541
...eight, nine-

2045
01:50:51,078 --> 01:50:54,079
- nine...
- Man:<i>...eight, seven,</i>

2046
01:50:54,181 --> 01:50:56,148
<i>six, five,</i>

2047
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:58,751
<i>four, three,</i>

2048
01:50:58,853 --> 01:51:01,353
<i>two, one,</i>

2049
01:51:01,455 --> 01:51:03,188
<i>zero.</i>

2050
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:08,427
Johnson's voice:
<i>These are the stakes</i>

2051
01:51:08,529 --> 01:51:12,965
<i>to make a world in which</i>
<i>all of God's children can live</i>

2052
01:51:13,067 --> 01:51:16,835
<i>or to go into the dark.</i>

2053
01:51:16,937 --> 01:51:20,372
<i>We must either</i>
<i>love each other</i>

2054
01:51:20,474 --> 01:51:22,508
<i>or we must die.</i>

2055
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:26,679
Announcer: <i>Vote for President
Johnson</i> <i>on November 3rd.</i>

2056
01:51:26,781 --> 01:51:30,182
<i>The stakes are too high</i>
<i>for you to stay home.</i>

2057
01:51:33,854 --> 01:51:35,688
I want you to run this
right away.

2058
01:51:38,092 --> 01:51:40,492
It'll be controversial.
You'll get a lot of flak.

2059
01:51:40,594 --> 01:51:42,695
Then we'll only have
to run it once,

2060
01:51:42,797 --> 01:51:45,097
then let the press
do our work for us.

2061
01:51:46,801 --> 01:51:49,334
I wanna see it again.

2062
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:54,840
Now, Barry Goldwater says
he's not a racist.

2063
01:51:54,942 --> 01:51:57,142
But the government
can't legislate

2064
01:51:57,244 --> 01:51:58,811
what people feel
in their hearts.

2065
01:51:58,913 --> 01:52:00,879
- Woman: That's right!
- King:<i> And he's right.</i>

2066
01:52:00,981 --> 01:52:04,416
The law can't make
white folks love you.

2067
01:52:04,518 --> 01:52:08,120
But the law can prevent them
from lynching you.

2068
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:13,559
The law can prevent them
from denying you a job

2069
01:52:13,661 --> 01:52:16,295
and your child
an education.

2070
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:20,165
And the law can ensure that
you have the right to vote.

2071
01:52:20,267 --> 01:52:22,501
- Amen!
- Yes!

2072
01:52:22,603 --> 01:52:27,372
I'm not here today to tell you
fine people who to vote for.

2073
01:52:27,475 --> 01:52:28,941
But come election day,

2074
01:52:29,043 --> 01:52:32,478
let's be sure to send the
fine senator from Arizona

2075
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:36,181
and his tender heart back to
the desert where he belongs.

2076
01:52:42,123 --> 01:52:44,123
Walter...

2077
01:52:44,225 --> 01:52:45,791
was arrested?

2078
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:49,428
YMCA men's bathroom
by the DC Vice Squad.

2079
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:54,299
<i>The other man arrested</i>
<i>was an army staff sergeant.</i>

2080
01:52:57,037 --> 01:52:59,138
No, no, no, no.

2081
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:00,773
This must be
some kind of mistake.

2082
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:02,307
Hoover:
<i>No, sir.</i>

2083
01:53:02,409 --> 01:53:04,042
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>Walter was arrested</i>

2084
01:53:04,145 --> 01:53:07,312
under similar circumstances
five years ago.

2085
01:53:08,783 --> 01:53:10,415
Now, why didn't
I know that?

2086
01:53:10,518 --> 01:53:12,351
Hoover:
<i>None of us knew.</i>

2087
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:16,355
<i>This has Goldwater's</i>
<i>fingerprints all over it.</i>

2088
01:53:18,526 --> 01:53:20,659
Goldwater will use this.

2089
01:53:20,761 --> 01:53:23,195
God damn, this close
to the election,

2090
01:53:23,297 --> 01:53:24,897
it could be
the whole ball of wax!

2091
01:53:24,999 --> 01:53:26,632
There doesn't
appear to be

2092
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:29,234
any security
compromise at all.

2093
01:53:30,571 --> 01:53:33,272
There damn well
better not be.

2094
01:53:33,374 --> 01:53:36,041
Your people said
they vetted him.

2095
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:38,644
I have it in writing with
your goddamn signature on it.

2096
01:53:38,746 --> 01:53:42,681
- There are some things you can't predict.
- That's your job, Edgar.

2097
01:53:42,783 --> 01:53:45,951
I will take care of this,
Mr. President.

2098
01:53:46,053 --> 01:53:49,488
And why don't that
make me feel any better?

2099
01:53:49,590 --> 01:53:52,991
<i>You get ahold of Walter's</i>
<i>Air Force Reserve records.</i>

2100
01:53:53,093 --> 01:53:55,627
<i>Goldwater was</i>
<i>his commanding officer.</i>

2101
01:53:55,729 --> 01:53:58,564
<i>With any luck, he signed off</i>
<i>on his fitness evaluations.</i>

2102
01:53:58,666 --> 01:54:02,701
<i>We get ahold of those</i> <i>and Goldwater
won't be able</i> <i>to say shit!</i>

2103
01:54:02,803 --> 01:54:04,903
<i>Walter will resign</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

2104
01:54:05,005 --> 01:54:07,372
<i>You see to it that his doctor</i>
<i>issues a statement.</i>

2105
01:54:07,474 --> 01:54:11,376
Um, he was working too hard
and just snapped.

2106
01:54:19,887 --> 01:54:23,989
I've been working
with that man for 25 years...

2107
01:54:25,459 --> 01:54:28,227
and not a clue.

2108
01:54:38,739 --> 01:54:43,175
How do you know when...

2109
01:54:45,012 --> 01:54:47,312
somebody's...?

2110
01:54:49,817 --> 01:54:52,784
Well, there's
certain signs,

2111
01:54:52,887 --> 01:54:54,753
mannerisms.

2112
01:54:54,855 --> 01:54:58,991
The way a man dresses
or combs his hair.

2113
01:55:00,194 --> 01:55:02,327
Walks kind of funny.

2114
01:55:02,429 --> 01:55:05,030
Huh, well...

2115
01:55:05,132 --> 01:55:07,499
that's news to me.

2116
01:55:10,104 --> 01:55:12,437
I'm not questioning you.

2117
01:55:14,008 --> 01:55:16,608
<i>I'm sure you'd know.</i>

2118
01:55:19,914 --> 01:55:22,948
In your line
of work, I mean.

2119
01:55:25,019 --> 01:55:27,686
Marjorie is just
beside herself.

2120
01:55:27,788 --> 01:55:29,688
Can't believe
it's true.

2121
01:55:29,790 --> 01:55:31,556
I can't believe
it's true.

2122
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:34,593
I am going to make a
public statement of support.

2123
01:55:34,695 --> 01:55:36,328
Absolutely not.

2124
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,031
The First Lady
can't be involved in this.

2125
01:55:39,133 --> 01:55:40,599
None of us
can be involved.

2126
01:55:40,701 --> 01:55:42,567
Why, he's distraught,
Lyndon.

2127
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,569
He could injure himself.

2128
01:55:44,672 --> 01:55:46,471
That is not my problem.

2129
01:55:46,573 --> 01:55:48,640
What-

2130
01:55:48,742 --> 01:55:50,342
He is our friend.

2131
01:55:50,444 --> 01:55:52,010
He was our friend

2132
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,645
and then he stabbed me
in the back.

2133
01:55:53,747 --> 01:55:56,415
What, are we just never
gonna see him again?

2134
01:55:56,517 --> 01:55:58,050
What, you think
I like this?

2135
01:55:58,152 --> 01:56:01,186
Now Goldwater's
killing me in the polls.

2136
01:56:06,393 --> 01:56:09,494
I loved Walter
like a s-

2137
01:56:12,132 --> 01:56:14,232
I'm holding
this campaign together

2138
01:56:14,335 --> 01:56:16,535
with baling wire
and spit.

2139
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:19,171
And if you're not with me,
then you're against me.

2140
01:56:19,273 --> 01:56:23,475
I know why you think you
have to do this, darling.

2141
01:56:23,577 --> 01:56:26,712
But you're wrong.
You do what you must.

2142
01:56:26,814 --> 01:56:30,382
But I will not
abandon our friend.

2143
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:33,552
Now if you'll excuse me,

2144
01:56:33,654 --> 01:56:36,188
I have speeches
to deliver.

2145
01:56:39,526 --> 01:56:41,727
God damn it.

2146
01:56:47,668 --> 01:56:49,701
- - Announcer:<i> In what</i>

I won't.

2156

King knows

2157

I don't need to get

2158

no warning is strong enough.

2164

2165
01:57:41,055 --> 01:57:42,087

Sir, are you sure the president

It's a Democratic rally,

Cowardly son of a bitch.

01:59:00,667 --> 01:59:02,567
<i>I've had enough</i>
<i>of this horseshit.</i>

2190
01:59:02,669 --> 01:59:05,437
Let's get a move on.
Move!

2191
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:09,708
And now-
now let's give

2192
01:59:09,810 --> 01:59:13,011
a nice, warm
New Orleans welcome

2193
01:59:13,113 --> 01:59:16,047
<i>to the President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

2194
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:26,458
All right.
All right!

2195
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,260
You've had your say

2196
01:59:28,362 --> 01:59:30,695
and now I'm gonna
have mine.

2197
01:59:34,001 --> 01:59:36,635
My fellow-
my fellow Southerners,

2198
01:59:36,737 --> 01:59:38,069
please.

2199
01:59:38,172 --> 01:59:41,339
I- I once got to know

2200
01:59:41,441 --> 01:59:45,076
this old senator
from the South

2201
01:59:45,179 --> 01:59:46,711
who lamented to me

2202
01:59:46,813 --> 01:59:51,216
the- the condition
of our beloved region.

2203
01:59:51,318 --> 01:59:53,618
The old senator

2204
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:57,756
talked about
how outside forces

2205
01:59:57,858 --> 02:00:01,960
divided and conquered
the people of the South

2206
02:00:02,062 --> 02:00:04,429
by appealing
to their racial hatred.

2207
02:00:04,531 --> 02:00:09,167
I accept this award on behalf
of a civil rights movement

2208
02:00:09,269 --> 02:00:12,037
which is working
to establish

2209
02:00:12,139 --> 02:00:15,974
a reign of freedom
and a rule of justice.

2210
02:00:16,076 --> 02:00:19,211
For only yesterday
in Alabama,

2211
02:00:19,313 --> 02:00:23,114
our children, crying out
for brotherhood,

2212
02:00:23,217 --> 02:00:26,084
were met
with water hoses,

2213
02:00:26,186 --> 02:00:28,954
dogs, and even death.

2214
02:00:29,056 --> 02:00:32,524
Now, the old senator
described

2215
02:00:32,626 --> 02:00:36,328
what a great future
the South could have

2216
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:38,997
if only we'd all
work together.

2217
02:00:39,099 --> 02:00:41,933
Only yesterday
in Mississippi

2218
02:00:42,035 --> 02:00:46,037
young people seeking
the right to vote

2219
02:00:46,139 --> 02:00:49,808
were brutalized
and murdered.

2220
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:54,946
And the old senator
talked longingly...

2221
02:00:55,882 --> 02:01:00,252
about going home
one more time

2222
02:01:00,354 --> 02:01:03,855
and telling people
the truth.

2223
02:01:03,957 --> 02:01:05,957
He said his poor state

2224
02:01:06,059 --> 02:01:09,694
hasn't heard the truth
in 30 years.

2225
02:01:09,796 --> 02:01:15,267
- - All we ever hear
at election time

2226
02:01:15,369 --> 02:01:18,470
is "Nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!"

2227
02:01:18,572 --> 02:01:22,707
<i>Well, I'm not gonna let them</i>
<i>build up the hate.</i>

2228
02:01:22,809 --> 02:01:26,645
I'm not gonna let them
trick my people

2229
02:01:26,747 --> 02:01:29,080
by appealing
to their prejudice.

2230
02:01:29,182 --> 02:01:33,285
I believe
peoples everywhere

2231
02:01:33,387 --> 02:01:37,722
can have dignity,
equality,

2232
02:01:37,824 --> 02:01:39,424
and freedom.

2233
02:01:39,526 --> 02:01:44,529
We have a new law
of the land.

2234
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:47,999
A civil rights law.

2235
02:01:49,002 --> 02:01:52,304
And I'm gonna enforce it

2236
02:01:52,406 --> 02:01:56,074
'cause it is
the right thing to do.

2237
02:02:01,882 --> 02:02:06,618
Announcer: <i>ABC News continues</i>
<i>its coverage of Election '64.</i>

2240
02:02:11,191 --> 02:02:13,525
has not yet reached the
position the polls gave him.

Reporter #2: The figures
have just come in.

2242
02:02:15,829 --> 02:02:19,030
Georgia, which has never
deserted the Democratic Party,

2243
02:02:19,132 --> 02:02:21,099
has gone
for Senator Goldwater.

2244

Reporter: <i>Senator Goldwater so far
is</i> <i>doing respectably in the South,</i>

2245
02:02:24,504 --> 02:02:27,572
so we'll just have to wait
to judge his basic strategy.

2246
02:02:27,674 --> 02:02:30,909
- - The polls are closing
right now in New York State.

2247
02:02:31,011 --> 02:02:34,479
<i>The "New York Herald Tribune"</i>

- President
of the United States.

2252
02:02:47,227 --> 02:02:49,661
How about that, huh?
How about that?

2253
02:02:49,763 --> 02:02:51,796
Isn't that something?

2254
02:02:51,898 --> 02:02:56,468
- Where's Lady Bird?
- Right behind you where I've always been.

2255
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:59,637
Oh, 60 million votes.

2256
02:02:59,740 --> 02:03:03,641
Oh, you're no accident,
Mr. President.

2257
02:03:03,744 --> 02:03:05,443
Mr. President,

2258
02:03:05,545 --> 02:03:07,512
you've got a phone call
from Senator Russell.

2259
02:03:07,614 --> 02:03:09,247
Well, all right!

2260
02:03:09,349 --> 02:03:12,050
Well, go on, go on,
have some fun!

2261
02:03:14,321 --> 02:03:16,354
I'll be with you
in a second.

2262
02:03:17,758 --> 02:03:21,626
- Uncle Dick.
- Congratulations, Mr. President.

2263
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:25,897
<i>Well, I'm just trying to do</i>
<i>what the old master taught me.</i>

2264
02:03:25,999 --> 02:03:27,599
You know none of this
would've happened

2265
02:03:27,701 --> 02:03:29,067
without you, Uncle Dick,
none of it.

2266
02:03:29,169 --> 02:03:31,369
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

2267
02:03:31,471 --> 02:03:33,571
My apologies
about Georgia.

2268
02:03:33,673 --> 02:03:36,441
Well, it was
disappointing, yeah.

2269
02:03:36,543 --> 02:03:40,145
Georgia has never
voted Republican before,

2270
02:03:40,247 --> 02:03:41,813
not once.

2271
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:44,015
Not even during
Reconstruction.

2272
02:03:44,117 --> 02:03:46,518
<i>Well, they'll be back.</i>

2273
02:03:50,157 --> 02:03:52,290
I sure wish
you was here.

2274
02:03:55,328 --> 02:03:56,795
<i>Listen, Uncle Dick,</i>

2275
02:03:56,897 --> 02:03:59,030
<i>you know we got a hell</i>
<i>of a lot of work ahead of us.</i>

2276
02:03:59,132 --> 02:04:01,332
<i>I-I'm counting</i>
<i>on you, now.</i>

2277
02:04:01,435 --> 02:04:04,102
I will give it
all that I have, sir.

2278
02:04:04,204 --> 02:04:05,870
I know you will.

2279
02:04:05,972 --> 02:04:07,639
You enjoy your party,
Mr. President.

2280
02:04:07,741 --> 02:04:09,441
I'll see you
in Washington.

2281
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:23,988
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

2282
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:25,890
Yeah.

2283
02:04:25,992 --> 02:04:28,526
My apologies.

2284
02:04:29,963 --> 02:04:32,363
From our ambassador
in Saigon.

2285
02:04:35,936 --> 02:04:37,936
A green light
for Mr. Johnson,

2286
02:04:38,038 --> 02:04:40,071
a stop light
for Senator Goldwater

2287
02:04:40,173 --> 02:04:42,907
and perhaps for the right wing
conservative control

2288
02:04:43,009 --> 02:04:44,776
<i>of the Republican Party.</i>

2289
02:04:44,878 --> 02:04:46,911
<i>These are the numbers.</i>

2290
02:04:47,013 --> 02:04:48,279
In electoral votes,
it is...

2291
02:04:48,381 --> 02:04:51,850
96% of the Negro vote
to Johnson.

2292
02:04:51,952 --> 02:04:53,485
They owe us big,
Martin.

2293
02:04:53,587 --> 02:04:56,354
<i>Now they gotta give us</i>
<i>that voting rights bill.</i>

2294
02:04:56,456 --> 02:04:58,990
Well, L.B.J. is not
gonna give us anything.

2295
02:04:59,092 --> 02:05:00,458
We've gotta take it.

2296
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:03,161
And we're gonna start
a new campaign right away

2297
02:05:03,263 --> 02:05:04,796
in Alabama.

2298
02:05:09,002 --> 02:05:12,904
I am so glad that it's
finally over, aren't you?

2299
02:05:13,006 --> 02:05:14,506
Over?

2300
02:05:14,608 --> 02:05:16,474
It's just
getting started.

2301
02:05:16,576 --> 02:05:19,410
Oh, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

2302
02:05:19,513 --> 02:05:22,480
Everybody's waiting for you.
Come join the party.

2303
02:05:22,582 --> 02:05:25,350
Your party, hmm?

2304
02:05:25,452 --> 02:05:26,951
In a minute.

2305
02:05:36,062 --> 02:05:39,197
Johnson's voice: <i>You're goddamn
right</i> <i>it's my party</i>

2306
02:05:39,299 --> 02:05:42,133
<i>and I had to drag it</i>
<i>into the light</i>

2307
02:05:42,235 --> 02:05:45,203
<i>kicking and screaming</i>
<i>every inch of the way.</i>

2308
02:05:45,305 --> 02:05:49,440
<i>'Cause this is</i>
<i>how new things are born.</i>

2309
02:05:50,343 --> 02:05:52,677
<i>Bird and I</i>
<i>lost three babies</i>

2310
02:05:52,779 --> 02:05:54,779
<i>before we had Lynda,</i>

2311
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:56,381
<i>and I remember</i>
<i>the moment</i>

2312
02:05:56,483 --> 02:05:58,416
<i>when they finally</i>
<i>let me into the room</i>

2313
02:05:58,518 --> 02:06:01,386
<i>to see my first</i>
<i>live child.</i>

2314
02:06:01,488 --> 02:06:03,321
<i>And there on the floor</i>

2315
02:06:03,423 --> 02:06:06,257
<i>you could still see</i>
<i>the doctor's footprints</i>

2316
02:06:06,359 --> 02:06:08,192
<i>in my wife's blood.</i>

2317
02:06:08,295 --> 02:06:14,265
<i>And I thought, "Yeah,</i>
<i>this is familiar.</i>

2318
02:06:14,367 --> 02:06:16,834
<i>I know this."</i>

2319
02:06:16,937 --> 02:06:20,605
<i>But right now,</i> <i>we're gonna
party</i> <i>like there's no tomorrow</i>

2320
02:06:20,707 --> 02:06:23,007
<i>'cause there's no feeling</i>
<i>in the world</i>

2321
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:25,109
<i>half as good</i>
<i>as winning.</i>

2322
02:06:25,211 --> 02:06:28,613
<i> But the sun will come up</i>

2323
02:06:28,715 --> 02:06:31,649
<i>and the knives</i>
<i>will come out</i>

2324
02:06:31,751 --> 02:06:34,619
<i>and all these</i>
<i>smiling faces</i>

2325
02:06:34,721 --> 02:06:36,654
<i>will be watching me,</i>

2326
02:06:36,756 --> 02:06:40,658
<i>waiting for that one</i>
<i>first moment of weakness.</i>

2327
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:45,563
<i>And then they will</i>
<i>gut me like a deer.</i>

2328
02:06:45,665 --> 02:06:47,765
You okay, honey?

2329
02:06:47,867 --> 02:06:50,134
I'm fine, Bird.

2330
02:06:51,304 --> 02:06:53,504
Johnson's voice:
<i>I'm great.</i>

2331
02:06:53,607 --> 02:06:55,640
