when everybody has masks on

fear and uncertainty.

of my personality

302
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,090

live as long as I can,

00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,110
I just get really tired.

354
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,050
It's just hard to--

355
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:34,230

It's typical, you know.

It just came on a
little sooner today.

I'm fighting really

361

hard to get through something.

362
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,200
And then I'll think
about my friend, Anita.

363

I don't remember when
I first found out,

364
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,010

365
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,230
I didn't know what it was.

366
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,190
It didn't even strike me as
being all that bad, frankly.

367
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,010

368
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,080
She'll go through chemo.

369
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,230
She's going to be fine.

370
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,070
And then when I saw her
going through her stem cell

371
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,130
transplant, that's
when it really hit me.

372
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,100
She's got a fatal cancer.

373
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,090
I mean, she's dying.

374
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,140
It just changed my
perspective about everything.

00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,200
I think about that
when I'm struggling.

376
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,140
Is something really so hard,
or is it really so bad?

377
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,120
I mean, I can certainly,
you know, keep running.

do math right now, babe?

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,140

he didn't get to 200 miles,

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,180

I thought to myself,
you can't even walk.

Every single step
he took was painful.

We just looked at each other and
we knew, like there was really

540
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,190
nothing needed to be said.

541
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,170
And he just apologized.

542
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,150
And I told him there was
nothing to apologize for.

543
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:10,070
And I called the crew over and
just said, we're going to stop.

00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,070
It was the right decision.

545
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,070
And I personally was relieved.

546
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,070
But I felt like
I had failed him.

get him through.

that he did in those first two

focused on falling

Eric had his share

of issues getting in trouble.

we called it the black years.

that would buy him black

made a conscious decision

to be a victim of life.

possibly could to hold her own.

rubbed off on Eric.

They're at the carousel.

And he's powering through.

707
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,100
He's just going to want drinks.

708
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,080
He's going to eat and fly
by like he did at the start.

We're working.

20 to 30 minutes,

720
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,000
Eric's going to be coming in
after running his 32nd lap

721
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,230
around Central Park.

722
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,190
He started Friday at 8 AM.

723
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:03,080
And we're going to go off
and finish the last lap.

724
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,010
It's crazy.

725
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:05,180
It's going to happen.

726
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,080
It's real.

is a matter of perspective.

728
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,040
When I'm done, I
mean, I'm like going

729
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,050
home and climbing into my bed.

730
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,000
And everything's fine, you know.

00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,180
Except for the fact that
all my friends are sick.

732
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,110
They go climb into bed,
and they're still sick.

733
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,170
You know, and they can't
get away from that.

734
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,210
So, you know, I
think about that.

735
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,140
And I, you know,
want them to live.
