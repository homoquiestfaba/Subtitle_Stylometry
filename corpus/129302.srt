1
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,443
La-la-la

2
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:50,279
La-la, la-la-la...

3
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,180
You ready?

4
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,119
Oh. Not going.

5
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,316
Not dressing up like an adult.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,359
Yeah, but we're
game-day players.

7
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,519
Come on.

8
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,289
Let's go.

9
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:06,127
Okay.

10
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,657
l put on the clothes,
and l feel better for a second

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,227
like l'm somebody
with someplace to go

12
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,739
but then l think
l'm a complete fraud

13
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,935
and they'll see
right through me.

14
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,635
...La-la-la

15
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,179
La-la, la-la-la...

16
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,277
A fine fantasy object,
but useful, too--

17
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:29,150
shitting, sitting,
insulation in the winter months.

18
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,883
Sam...

19
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:36,561
...La-la-la

20
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,755
La-la, la-la-la...

21
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,389
Not an easy job market

22
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,492
but you're the most sought-after
graduates in history.

23
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,695
Know your value.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,294
Sell to the highest bidder.

25
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,463
Now, we know your...

26
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,564
...market share
of existing markets.

27
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,801
Nothing else matters.

28
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,844
You can talk
about your art history

29
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,277
your Derrida,
your la-dee-dah, your poetry

30
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,781
but in reality,
the moment you step outside

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,444
the magic circle drawn
around this institution

32
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,612
you are at the mercy
of market forces

33
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,452
and nowhere will prepare you
more thoroughly to harness

34
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,389
those forces
for your own benefit

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,620
than McKinsey
and Company Consulting.

36
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,061
Remember, follow the bouncing
ball to McKinsey.

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,894
You got to get
over to l-banking.

38
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,400
You won't buy workout clothes
for ten years.

39
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,868
Somehow l don't see you working
in a bank.

40
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,700
Thanks.

41
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,732
l calculated the odds
of getting hired by McKinsey.

42
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,644
From Stanford or here,
it's about 500 to one.

43
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,944
From anywhere else,
forget about it.

44
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,381
Why do you tell me these things?

45
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,498
So...

46
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,941
how you doing?

47
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,104
l'm fine.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,774
That could be the most dangerous
lie you tell today.

49
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,613
Come on, Bill.
l've been back for ten minutes.

50
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,710
Just put me to work.
l'll be okay.

51
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,780
l've got a Missing Persons.

52
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,326
Male, Caucasian, 24 years.

53
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,759
Name: Embry Larkin.

54
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,160
So, when'd this kid go missing?

55
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,699
Uh... two years ago,
from the university.

56
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,759
Rich kid.
Dropped out. No family.

57
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,066
Some um, lawyer-- a trustee--

58
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,869
says he hasn't touched
his accounts.

59
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,308
Now tell me he was
on drugs and depressed.

60
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,776
Well, there is a drug thing,
yeah.

61
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:33,777
Come on, Bill.

62
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,040
He drove up north

63
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,877
with a couple of rocks
in his pocket.

64
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,781
-He jumped in a lake.
-Hey, we're not looking

65
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,182
to hit any home runs here, okay?

66
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,413
The kid had money.

67
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,355
lt's going to get investigated
and you're the right guy today.

68
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,290
You going to give me a cruiser?

69
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,223
''Boa. B-O-A.''

70
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,698
My mother's been
to a snake church.

71
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,200
Did you say, ''snake church''?

72
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,668
Yeah, snake church.

73
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,535
Okay. ''Persian religious
teacher.'' Nine letters.

74
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,574
Zoroaster.

75
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,734
Great. Good and evil.

76
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,300
''My book is Genius''--
''Genius'' capitalized.

77
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,243
He's a physicist.
l should know this.

78
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,302
He had weird hair.

79
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,348
''Feynman. F-E...''

80
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,677
l can spell ''Feynman.''

81
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,739
''F-U-C. Feynman.''

82
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,843
l'm sorry.

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,649
My McKinsey interview is
in 30 minutes.

84
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,088
Personally, l'm not a dog
that salivates every time

85
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,717
some l-banker consultant
rings his little bell.

86
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,819
Hey, um, Katie, um

87
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,420
l love being friends
in quotation marks.

88
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,796
lt makes me so horny.

89
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,632
Knock it off. We are friends.

90
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,264
Hey, Katie.

91
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,535
Amanda. Sam. August.

92
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,101
So, um, we were just talking
about friendship and how...

93
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,578
How we'll all be selling out.

94
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,580
Sooner or later.

95
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,877
Some of us sooner than others.

96
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,212
l don't know, you guys.

97
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,947
l think it's just really about
doing what makes you happy.

98
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:52,822
He's right. Harrison,
you're just so... hopeful.

99
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,883
Oh, thanks.

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,513
Sorry to keep you waiting.

101
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,412
l already spoke
with two officers.

102
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,576
l'm not sure
what else l can tell you.

103
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,119
Right, right.

104
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,020
Well, those other two detectives
are no longer on this case.

105
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,284
l am.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,351
So, what makes you think
Embry Larkin is dead?

107
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,760
Purely account activity.

108
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,764
We haven't heard from him
in a couple of years.

109
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,356
He hasn't used
any credit facilities.

110
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,833
But this kid was
all over the map.

111
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,166
l mean, how do we know
he's not sitting on some island

112
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,727
smoking Thai stick,
wearing a sheet?

113
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,535
He also had
two first-class airline tickets

114
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,131
to Athens, Greece,
that he never used.

115
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,369
lt takes seven years

116
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,935
for a missing person
to be declared dead.

117
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,312
Now's as good a time as any
to get the ball rolling.

118
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,407
Right.

119
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,678
Well, who gets the money?

120
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,310
The Larkin Foundation.

121
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,151
-All of it?
-All of it.

122
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,715
Look, his family was a client
of the original partners.

123
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,193
l don't know this kid at all.

124
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,414
Katie!

125
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,014
Hi, Katie Burke.

126
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,058
There is a message for you.

127
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,652
Your thesis advisor,
Professor Jergensen's office

128
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,425
they said l should find you,
so l did.

129
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,262
Here's the message.

130
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,894
lt says for you to come
to Jergensen's house.

131
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,129
That's scary.

132
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,070
How's your thesis coming,
anyway?

133
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,370
lt's almost done. How's yours?

134
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,879
Turned it in.

135
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,779
Ms. Burke, l'd like
to have you meet Wade Handler.

136
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,816
He's a police officer.

137
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,815
Hello.

138
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,146
Hi.

139
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,914
Mr. Handler has a line
of inquiries...

140
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,352
That's ''Detective,'' Professor.

141
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,720
''Doctor,'' Detective.

142
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,691
Detective Handler has a line
of inquiry

143
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,193
that he's forcing
upon the college.

144
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,751
Force?
Oh, no, we don't use force--

145
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,889
not in the People's Republic--
we ask politely

146
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,695
because the college is good
for the tax base

147
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,668
which is good
for the community

148
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,499
which is good for everybody.

149
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,233
So, um, Katherine Burke...

150
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,467
Katie.

151
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,510
Katie... l'm investigating
a young man

152
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,411
who was a student here,
Embry Larkin.

153
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,073
Something happen to him?

154
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,879
Well, that's
what l'm trying to find out.

155
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,816
What was your relationship?

156
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,252
He was my boyfriend.

157
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,156
Detective, this college is
very proactive

158
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,989
about the privacy
of its students.

159
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,995
Oh, l understand, Doctor.
l'll be gentle.

160
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:22,859
So... he was your boyfriend?

161
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,630
He disappeared.

162
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,467
He left school.

163
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,904
He disappeared,
or he left school?

164
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:28,906
Which?

165
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,269
Both, l think.

166
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,903
l... haven't heard from him.

167
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,503
Not once?

168
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,343
Not even once.

169
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,780
Do you have any idea

170
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,114
-where he might be?
-No.

171
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,655
That's fine.

172
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,917
Thank you for your time.

173
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,923
Here's my card.

174
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,027
lf you think of anything else,
just give me a call, all right?

175
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,086
How's your thesis coming?

176
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,596
l'm learning so much.

177
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,360
You have a draft for me?

178
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,923
Close, really close.

179
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,899
Let's preserve our older dorms.

180
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,403
Go home, leave it alone.

181
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,374
Let's preserve our older dorms.

182
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,101
Go home, leave it alone.

183
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,143
Let's preserve
our older dorms...

184
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,944
How'd it go?

185
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,174
l completely blew it.

186
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,809
There's tea and stale pastries.

187
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,082
Don't, whatever you do,
take one.

188
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,522
l got crumbs
all over my cashmere sweater.

189
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,685
l won't be wearing
a cashmere sweater.

190
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,956
So, l don't think
that'll be a problem.

191
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,624
Ooh, working-class hero,
good strategy.

192
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,961
They hated me.

193
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:35,966
l could tell.

194
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,095
They want Vietnamese orphans...
and engineers.

195
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,469
God, why wasn't I born
a Vietnamese orphan?

196
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,871
This is so familiar--

197
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,070
''l blew it. l'm a loser,'' and
then, ''Oh, look, l got an A.''

198
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,112
No.

199
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,477
l lost my concentration.

200
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,981
l wasn't supposed
to concentrate.

201
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,607
lt was supposed
to be effortless.

202
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,983
And then,
l started concentrating

203
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,611
and becoming earnest

204
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,624
and then l started seeing them
as seeing me as seeing myself

205
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,092
as the type of person who wants
to appear earnest

206
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,458
which is completely wro...

207
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,464
Do you hear what's going on
up here?

208
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,296
l hate wearing
these itchy things.

209
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,926
How do l look?

210
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,267
How do you think you look?

211
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,273
...Of unbounded domesticity

212
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,935
Though a doctor of divinity
is located in this vicinity

213
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,377
But they give up the felicity
of unbounded domesticity

214
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,847
Though a doctor of divinity

215
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,406
A doctor of divinity...

216
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,477
Headline: ''Composer

217
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:33,958

and lacerated the audience
for their attendance.''

224
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,148
He flipped off 200 people

225
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,153
and disappeared three weeks
before graduation.

226
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,086
He was already
Summa Cum Laude

227
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,750
and he says,
''Screw you and your degree.''

228
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:11,525
lt was exceedingly theatrical
and standard Embry.

229
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,928
What was standard about it?

230
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,329
Dropped out twice--

231
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,167
once to work on some
archeological dig in Cambodia...

232
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,570
once to work in a factory.

233
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,132
l expect him to pop up
running La Scala

234
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,940
or the Berlin Opera.

235
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,171
What a guy.

236
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,948
800 math S.A.T.s.

237
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:32,949

238
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,508
Thesis?

239
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,182
''Emerging Ancillary Markets in
the Global Wireless Revolution.''

240
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,724
l bet that's quite a read.

241
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,727
We're actually looking
to beef up our Tech Practice

242
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,093
but then you probably
already knew that.

243
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,496
So...

244
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,794
''Katherine Burke...''

245
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,857
who are you?

246
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,926
Where do you come from?

247
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,801
l grew up
in the middle of nowhere.

248
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,568
The birthplace
of Wendell Willkie

249
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,609
is 20 miles away,
and that's about it.

250
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:01,009
My mom works in a bottling plant
and sells Nutra-Life products

251
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,105
and my dad left
when l was little.

252
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,672
l never really knew him.

253
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,275
Hmm.

254
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,286
Tell us about a problem
you've encountered.

255
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,825
My guidance counselor tried

256
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,123
to keep me from applying
to good schools.

257
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,719
l thought she was my friend.

258
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,230
She said she understood me

259
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,096
and that l would be happier
staying close to home--

260
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,159
junior college
or secretarial school.

261
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,464
She hated me.

262
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,096
What action did you take?

263
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,573
l invited a senator
who attended college here

264
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,904
to speak at our school.

265
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,273
And what was the result?

266
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,835
l got a strong letter
of recommendation

267
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,439
from a U.S. Senator,
was accepted early decision

268
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,541
and they gave me
lots of financial aid.

269
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,552
And what did you learn
from this experience?

270
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,484
Truthfully?

271
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,647
Of course.

272
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,083
Mrs. Castleman
was a sneaky bitch.

273
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,219
lt was the first time
l was betrayed

274
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,558
by someone l trusted.

275
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,790
l looked up to her.

276
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,059
l didn't come close

277
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,432
to understanding the depth
to which she resented me.

278
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,438
l learned that people
who help me, who invest in me

279
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,475
become my partners,
and my success is their success

280
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,407
that relationships
are symbiotic.

281
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,640
l learned responsibility
based on others' faith in me.

282
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,979
l hope to be able to pay some
dividends to those investors.

283
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,554
How many pennies
do you think it would take

284
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,679
to fill this room?

285
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,746
With or without us in it?

286
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,931
Whoa, whoa, stop!

287
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:39,101
Okay, that was... appalling.

288
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:44,309
Sopranos, this piece was written
by monks who believed in God.

289
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,079
They're singing
not to other monks

290
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,382
but to God.

291
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,720
They're singing
about God to God.

292
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,954
And you think
Im a tough audience.

293
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,393
Okay, l'd like to hear you

294
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,295
you, and...

295
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,890
you.

296
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,195
Step down here.

297
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,401
From the beginning.

298
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,137
And...

299
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,860
You and you.

300
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,067
And...

301
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,610
You.

302
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,020
Again.

303
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,961
Sing.

304
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,700
This is the spirit
dissolving in the music

305
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,334
carrying up to God...

306
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,242
Open up and let her rip.

307
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,040
Don't perform... create.

308
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:31,146
Say, ''Muse, l hate you,
but l hate you on my knees.''

309
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,920
Scream, ''l am the infantile
center of the goddamn universe!''

310
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,928
Everyone!

311
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,262
l am the infantile center
of the goddamn universe!

312
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,960
Now everyone!

313
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,463
Are you listening to this?

314
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,870
Water polo or lacrosse?

315
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:26,933
Lacrosse.

316
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,114
Word is, you slaughtered it.

317
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,343
l talked to Brian

318
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,283
whose brother dates
that cold fish, Susan.

319
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,184
Did you really call
some lady a bitch?

320
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,519
Slight exaggeration.

321
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,855
Yeah, they saw 60 people
and liked exactly two--

322
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,919
you and a North Korean girl
who speaks eight languages.

323
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,657
They said that?

324
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,475
Ms. Burke?

325
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,578
You sure work hard.

326
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,381
Listen, do you have time
for a cup of coffee?

327
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,422
No, l really don't.

328
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,039
Steam heat.

329
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,135
The best kind.

330
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,875
Doesn't dry you out up here.

331
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,509
You're not a big one
for small talk, are you?

332
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,075
l mean, l get it, believe me.

333
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,054
A person can really piss their
life away talking to idiots.

334
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,563
Do you think it's possible
this kid, Embry

335
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,157
might have killed himself?

336
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,331
Nobody with Embry's self-regard
would kill himself.

337
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,501
Nobody. He would have himself
bronzed first.

338
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:06,874
ln fact...

339
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,708
if you see a statue
of him somewhere

340
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,875
check and see
if there's a person inside.

341
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,579
He hurt you that badly, huh?

342
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,725
lt's none of your business.

343
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,817
Well, actually, it's my job,
so it is my business.

344
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,556
You know, l'd love
to just pal around

345
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,621
and talk about the past--
really, l would--

346
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:27,756
but l'm actually trying

347
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,391
to move on with my life
right now.

348
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,459
Right.

349
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,737
l'll see you around.

350
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,081
We need to be quiet...

351
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,586
in the library!

352
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,589
Quiet!

353
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,624
Studying...

354
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,750
Ah, 10:30 on a Friday night.

355
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,623
l wonder where Katie is?

356
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,822
l thought you were entertaining
the lacrosse team.

357
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,922
l was being entertained
by the lacrosse team.

358
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,365
The global wireless revolution
will be safe until tomorrow.

359
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,562
And the day after.
We're leaving.

360
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,382
Want a blender drink?

361
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,353
No, blender drinks suck.

362
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,835
Oh, look, it's a Siberian bear.

363
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,166
Who paid for all this?

364
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,365
What?

365
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,805
Who paid for all of this?

366
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:46,970
His dad was just appointed
Governor of Uttar Pradesh.

367
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,172
Evening, Mr. Bond.

368
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,343
To Russia.

369
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,543
What?

370
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,951
-To Russia.
-To Russia.

371
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,319
Yeah.

372
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,889
Match you.

373
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:03,893
-Again.
-Again.

374
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:04,894
Again.

375
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,021
-Again.
-Again.

376
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,504
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

377
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:56,748
What makes a kettle whistle?

378
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:06,047
What makes gold precious?

379
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,120
Right now...

380
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,792
everything is so perfect.

381
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,465
l feel so connected.

382
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,270
We'll show you everything...

383
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,335
Why don't we feel
this way all the time?

384
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,382
Maybe l'll always wear a hat.

385
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,422
Hat guy.

386
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,424
The guy who wears the hat.

387
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:50,162
Beautiful day

388
00:22:55,474 --> 00:23:00,309
lt's a beautiful day

389
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,977
lt's a beautiful day

390
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,658
lt's a beautiful day

391
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:27,366
lt's a beautiful day

392
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:36,546
lt's a beautiful day.

393
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,902
Are you all right?

394
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,344
No.

395
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,279
Look, Katie...

396
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,681
um... a cop stopped by my room.

397
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,152
He left a note.

398
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:19,281
He said he wanted
to ask questions about Embry.

399
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,591
He probably talked to you first
and, uh, you know

400
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,465
l was just hoping
it didn't upset you.

401
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:36,633
Harrison, my entire body feels
like rusting metal.

402
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,443
And l'm seeing things.

403
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,606
l think l might have
a chemical depression.

404
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,845
Come on.

405
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,479
You are not one of those people.

406
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,522
What people?

407
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,182
The problem people.

408
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,489
You know, ''Hey, look,
have you seen my new problem?

409
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,619
''Hey, guess what?

410
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,425
l got a shiny new problem.''

411
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,659
You're not like that.

412
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,325
You're amazing.

413
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,663
No, l'm not.

414
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,672
Okay, um, you know what?

415
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,537
This is what we should do first.

416
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:11,837
Let's get out of here.

417
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,174
There is a huge
anti-globalization rally.

418
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,235
We could camp out.

419
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,178
We could get arrested.

420
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,807
Just stand for something.

421
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,285
l'd like to go to sleep now...

422
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,255
and when l wake up,
l'll stand for something.

423
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,756
Katie, it's not a joke.

424
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,122
Yes, it is!

425
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,024
Harrison, it's a huge joke.

426
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,494
Anti-globalization?

427
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,691
You might as well stop oxygen
or the sun coming up.

428
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,358
You know what?

429
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,766
You're really tired.

430
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:39,929
Um... yeah.

431
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,598
You're very tired

432
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,142
and l am, uh... l'm going to go.

433
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,041
Um... you know

434
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,704
if you think about it, please

435
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,078
try not to forget
our plans this weekend.

436
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,673
Okay?

437
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,901
Let's talk about you...

438
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,801
about your yodeling.

439
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,600
Level with me.

440
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:18,006
You've never sung anything
before, have you?

441
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,237
l've sung...

442
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,543
in the shower, walking,
sort of under my breath.

443
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,708
Burt Bacharach.

444
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,809
Johnny Mathis.

445
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,392
l wanted to meet you.

446
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,898
Hey...

447
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,502
Uh-uh-uh...

448
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,517
You're a virgin.

449
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:06,045
Nobody this organized
ever had time for sex.

450
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,517
Okay, Katie from Rushville

451
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,891
if you have a voice, you sing.

452
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,294
Nobody ever said, ''lf you
had a voice, take finance.''

453
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:20,327
l've been working, baby

454
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,300
Till l'm down

455
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,370
Just want to get
next to you, boy

456
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:35,084
l've been searching, baby

457
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,714
For a way to tell you how

458
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,258
All of the time

459
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,725
You took it

460
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,659
All of the time...

461
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,013
What now?

462
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,886
Whoa. ls this a bad time, or...?

463
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,889
No. l'm sorry.

464
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,894
l thought you were
somebody else.

465
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,191
That's good for me,
not for them.

466
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,428
So, we're having a little event
at an NBA game

467
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:24,798
kind of a meet-and-greet.

468
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,801
lt's fun, you know

469
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,896
if you're into pretending
you're not under a microscope.

470
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,804
Do you like basketball, or...?

471
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,104
l don't know.

472
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,010
Oh. Uh...

473
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,482
Sure. l'll come.

474
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,280
l... Thank you.

475
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,910
lt's exciting.

476
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,512
That's... for you.

477
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,149
See you.

478
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,865
lnability or helplessness

479
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,335
can have serious
psychological ramifications.

480
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:04,307
Powerless people become
either hostile or passive.

481
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,468
Neither is desirable.

482
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,274
We need to feel
that we are heard

483
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,282
and that justice
has been attempted

484
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,478
when we feel we are
unfairly treated.

485
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,045
Negotiation for resolution
of disputes

486
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,150
when your actions
prevent another

487
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,855
from achieving their goal...

488
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,600
is apparently a conflict
of interest...

489
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,863
lf we were to define goals...

490
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,463
La-la-la

491
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:43,314
La-la la-la-la

492
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,617
Where is this?

493
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:49,914
lt's not a theater.

494
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:54,219
Embry was interested
in non-traditional space.

495
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,692
This is under the theater.

496
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,695
My final production--

497
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,458
MiddIebrow For Lowbrows--

498
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,056
''but look

499
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,931
''we're under the stage,
like hell, itself.

500
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,800
lsn't that brilliant?''

501
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,069
lt's derivative.

502
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,736
You people are derivative.

503
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,440
You haven't produced
a real artist in over a decade

504
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,607
and l would rather be dead
than mediocre.

505
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:22,141
So, one last announcement
before the show:

506
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,820
Screw this play

507
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,792
screw this place

508
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,159
and screw you people.

509
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:38,866
And then he vanished,
like a magic trick.

510
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,666
Where do you think he went?

511
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,400
Word is, he had a car waiting.

512
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,136
Probably went to the airport.

513
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:36,259
l guess l haven't been feeling
like myself lately...

514
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,954
whatever that means.

515
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,620
l mean, l don't...

516
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,097
l don't know
what ''myself'' feels like.

517
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,862
lt's subjective
and changes all the time.

518
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,571
Have you been feeling uneasy?

519
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,376
l'm having trouble
finishing my thesis.

520
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,677
Uh... l'm having
trouble sleeping

521
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,584
and when l do sleep,
l'm having these weird dreams.

522
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,713
Huh.

523
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,362
You're exhausted, yeah?

524
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,455
Emotionally

525
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,227
mentally

526
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,928
and physically?

527
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,213
Okay.

528
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,585
This should help you
with the anxiety, all right?

529
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,955
And l'd like to schedule
a regular time for us...

530
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,858
at least until exams are over.

531
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:45,896
Okay?

532
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,431
l just keep thinking

533
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,058
that the finish line is
right there

534
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,696
and if l can just get across it
then everything will be okay.

535
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,803
We'll get you across.

536
00:32:57,869 --> 00:33:01,896
So, l'm going to see him now,
l guess, on a regular basis.

537
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:04,032
You just want to do him.
l know you.

538
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,133
You know you.

539
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,701
He is cute.

540
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,440
Mm, sort of.
He's not my type.

541
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:12,312
Smart, sensitive,
wants only to talk about you--

542
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:13,908
how is that not your type?

543
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:17,045
Sam, l can't read,
l can't sleep...

544
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,920
And l'm sure Dr. Dave will be
able to give you what you need.

545
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:21,822
l'm serious.

546
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:23,918
Okay, okay,
did he sit behind his desk

547
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:26,155
or did he pull his chair
close to you?

548
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:28,665
Close to me.

549
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:33,500
Did he... lean over like this?

550
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,969
Did he look into your eyes
like this?

551
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:40,175
You're going to do him.

552
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:41,177
Sam...

553
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:44,943
Come on, how long has it been,
sophomore year?

554
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:48,952
What if it's rusty... or broken?

555
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,851
l still feel like
l'm betraying him.

556
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:53,755
Embry? Please.

557
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,623
What if Embry comes back?

558
00:33:56,695 --> 00:34:01,359
He'd... wreck your life
just like before.

559
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:06,571
Listen, l want
to tell you something.

560
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:09,732
Um, l believe your friend,
Embry, is dead.

561
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,910
He had two airline tickets
for Athens, Greece.

562
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:16,911
Never used.
No credit activity.

563
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:19,710
He didn't... he didn't believe
in credit.

564
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,911
No cash withdrawals.
No ATM.

565
00:34:21,987 --> 00:34:24,421
Was that other ticket for you?

566
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,548
Were you going to Athens?

567
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,825
Originally, but we were
both having second thoughts.

568
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:34,331
Well, l saw the beginning
of that show--

569
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,629
his speech to the audience.

570
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:38,896
Look, that was
just Embry being Embry.

571
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,699
He was going for shock value.

572
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:44,173
He was leaving;
l was a sophomore.

573
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:47,302
l mean, l thought
that he would call from Europe

574
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,576
and maybe l would meet up
with him in the summer.

575
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,674
l never heard from him.

576
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:59,821
You have unusually kind eyes.

577
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:05,427
See you around, Detective.

578
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:11,096
l'm Wade Handler.

579
00:35:11,169 --> 00:35:12,500
l'm a cop.

580
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:21,604
You don't have to share
if you don't want to.

581
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,615
l don't even know what to say.

582
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:25,741
Uh...

583
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:31,481
l'd find tollbooth tickets
and credit card receipts

584
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:35,617
for bars in towns
l didn't think l'd been to.

585
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:39,391
One day l went out to my car

586
00:35:39,464 --> 00:35:41,796
and there's a dent in the front.

587
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:44,733
l look closer.

588
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:49,467
There's blood
and some brown hair.

589
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:56,742
l still don't know
what happened.

590
00:35:56,815 --> 00:35:58,783
Maybe it was a cat.

591
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,253
There was an incident
two years ago

592
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:06,517
involving an undergraduate
student and illegal drugs.

593
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:08,786
Right. What do you want to know
about Embry Larkin?

594
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,157
Well, he got himself arrested.

595
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:11,718
l want to know
what he was selling.

596
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:12,888
Was it heroin?

597
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,989
Heroin? Embry?

598
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:15,998
Are you kidding?

599
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,898
l'm not kidding.

600
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:19,664
No, no, he wasn't
into that shit.

601
00:36:19,738 --> 00:36:21,899
They put him on Ritalin
when he was three

602
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,339
you know, your standard
A.D.D. misdiagnosis.

603
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,071
Okay, um...

604
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:32,749
Basically, he was
taking Wellbutrin

605
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,786
which is sort of like having
a perfect cup of coffee.

606
00:36:35,854 --> 00:36:39,255
You know, it was great for work,
great for repetitive tasks.

607
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:40,586
Add in some Paxil

608
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,785
which is anti-depression,
anti-anxiety--

609
00:36:42,861 --> 00:36:45,193
you know, that general sense
of well-being.

610
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:46,355
Was he selling it?

611
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:49,628
Look, Embry's dad was rich
and Embry's mom was rich

612
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,101
and they died
when he was three or four

613
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,195
making him doubly rich,
so... no.

614
00:36:54,272 --> 00:36:55,933
So, what'd it do?

615
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:59,408
Made him normal,
you know, when he took it.

616
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:29,229
La-la-la

617
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,397
La-la-la, la-la-la...

618
00:38:34,472 --> 00:38:36,064
Katie...

619
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,952
l heard my name whispered...

620
00:40:39,097 --> 00:40:44,262
''Katie. Katie.''

621
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:47,930
There was somebody on the
other side of the row of books.

622
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:49,906
l think it was my old boyfriend.

623
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:50,963
l think he's back.

624
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,407
l'm almost certain l saw him
in his car.

625
00:40:53,478 --> 00:40:55,275
l think he's been watching me.

626
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:57,143
And how does that make you feel?

627
00:40:57,215 --> 00:40:58,477
Nervous...

628
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:01,916
elated...

629
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,317
scared.

630
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:06,755
l want to see him, but...

631
00:41:06,824 --> 00:41:11,284
but scared
that l want to see him.

632
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:12,693
Why do you say scared?

633
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,255
Because l lost a part
of myself with him.

634
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,460
l just dissolved.

635
00:41:21,005 --> 00:41:22,802
He was like a drug.

636
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:27,277
And he was locked
inside the library with you?

637
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:28,869
l think so, yes.

638
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:31,039
But you hadn't seen him
in two years?

639
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,639
l know how this sounds.

640
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:35,345
Katie, you fell asleep
in an old library

641
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,878
which is terrifying under
the best of circumstances.

642
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:42,949
You're facing your graduation,
the completion of your thesis

643
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:46,188
job interviews...
life-changing transitions.

644
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:48,198
You need to make allowances

645
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:51,201
for the emotions
that this will bring up.

646
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:52,702
Yeah?

647
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,706
He convinced her
she could be an artist.

648
00:41:56,774 --> 00:41:59,971
They were going to live
in a houseboat in Amsterdam...

649
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:02,205
a sailboat off the coast
of Sardinia.

650
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,511
He'd compose, she'd sing
and tell him he was a genius.

651
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,552
Please, l'll have a double order
of escape fantasy

652
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,246
and a side of running away.

653
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,913
He was losing interest?

654
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:13,216
l saw it coming.

655
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:15,555
He'd replaced her in his show.

656
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:17,093
That bastard hurt her.

657
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:20,324
You know, she hasn't
dated anyone in two years.

658
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,059
Was he a jealous guy?

659
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:26,832
He didn't like her friends,
particularly the guy friends--

660
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:30,499
particularly, one friend--
this guy, Harrison Hobart.

661
00:42:30,575 --> 00:42:32,509
He felt threatened by me.

662
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:36,206
Katie and l are close,
and one day he was being

663
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,273
a bit of a bully psychologically
and l said something.

664
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:41,613
He turned on me.

665
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:44,314
He just started poking me
in the chest

666
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,289
with his... with his finger

667
00:42:46,357 --> 00:42:48,917
until, finally,
l stopped backing up.

668
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:52,895
You know, l didn't realize
he had a bottle in his hand.

669
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:54,898
He put you in the hospital.

670
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:58,265
Yeah, well,
it was only overnight.

671
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:01,237
Why didn't you press charges?

672
00:43:01,305 --> 00:43:03,899
lf you had pressed charges

673
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:06,705
Katie might've held it
against you?

674
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:12,148
Yeah, probably.

675
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:14,707
You see

676
00:43:14,786 --> 00:43:16,913
Embry didn't want to admit it

677
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:19,215
but Katie and l had
much more in common

678
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:20,814
than the two of them did...

679
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:22,917
and he apologized, so...

680
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,393
What is your relationship
with Katie?

681
00:43:26,464 --> 00:43:28,432
Oh, man, l wish l knew.

682
00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:29,830
You dating her?

683
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:33,692
l don't know.

684
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:34,897
Well, sort of.

685
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:38,669
Well, either you are
or you're not... right?

686
00:43:38,743 --> 00:43:43,874
ls this about Embry
or is this about Katie?

687
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:58,955
l remember my dad leaving.

688
00:43:59,063 --> 00:44:02,590
Almost my first memory.

689
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:06,000
He said, ''l love you.

690
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,470
You can't come with me.''

691
00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:13,977
My mom turned the heat down
to 55 to save money.

692
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,447
l just remember this...

693
00:44:20,518 --> 00:44:25,478
feeling of... emptiness...

694
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:32,092
...always being cold.

695
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:19,369
Sam...

696
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,102
-Hey.
-Hey.

697
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,574
l hope l'm not
interrupting anything.

698
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:35,584
Oh, well...

699
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:38,383
big night.

700
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:47,461
l saw Embry.

701
00:46:47,531 --> 00:46:50,364
l think he's back
and l think he's watching me.

702
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:52,265
Where did you see him?

703
00:46:52,336 --> 00:46:54,327
l saw him outside of class.

704
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:56,430
l saw him get into his car.

705
00:46:56,507 --> 00:46:58,600
You want to...
you want to sit down?

706
00:46:58,676 --> 00:47:00,644
You're kind of making me
nervous.

707
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:06,872
Are you afraid of him?

708
00:47:07,018 --> 00:47:08,280
ls that why you're here?

709
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:12,380
l'm just afraid.

710
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:16,256
Okay.

711
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:17,885
l'll look into it.

712
00:47:20,498 --> 00:47:22,489
Thanks.

713
00:47:22,566 --> 00:47:25,433
You know, l'm not
really doing anything.

714
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:28,336
You're welcome
to hang out if you want.

715
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:35,807
Okay.

716
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,848
Okay.

717
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:54,923
So... why did you become a cop?

718
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:56,830
Oh, l don't know.

719
00:47:56,901 --> 00:47:59,927
l, um... l had some issues.

720
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:01,835
l was screwing up.

721
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:06,343
My uncle had a badge
and he cut me a break.

722
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:09,072
What kind of issues?

723
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:12,172
Extreme...

724
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:15,878
extreme substance abuse.

725
00:48:15,953 --> 00:48:17,614
Being a cop help?

726
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:19,883
Oh, no.

727
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:21,447
Uh-uh.

728
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:22,685
What do you mean?

729
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,129
Well, l got a pocketful
of Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free cards

730
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:29,632
and l never changed anything.

731
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,168
Then l used up all the cards.

732
00:48:37,108 --> 00:48:40,100
Setting the foundation.

733
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:46,177
Recreational logging.

734
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:51,284
Squirrel.

735
00:48:53,023 --> 00:48:54,581
Who took all these?

736
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:57,218
Self-timer.

737
00:48:57,294 --> 00:48:58,761
Ex-fiancee.

738
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:03,391
She got tired
of The Handler Show.

739
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:05,867
Yeah, when things
start going too good

740
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:08,598
l can't help myself,
l got to mess 'em up.

741
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:11,232
lt's my M.O., anyway.

742
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:15,274
Finished product.

743
00:49:22,386 --> 00:49:24,286
Excuse me.

744
00:50:13,671 --> 00:50:17,539
Can you take me home now,
please?

745
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,773
Katie?

746
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:23,473
You scared me.

747
00:50:27,184 --> 00:50:29,948
Harrison, l'm...
l completely forgot.

748
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:31,952
l'm sorry.

749
00:50:32,089 --> 00:50:32,953
You lied.

750
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:33,954
You lied to me.

751
00:50:34,091 --> 00:50:35,615
l'm a... l'm a total idiot.

752
00:50:35,693 --> 00:50:38,127
l'm just... l'm completely
deluding myself!

753
00:50:38,195 --> 00:50:40,493
No, you're not an idiot!

754
00:50:40,564 --> 00:50:42,429
You're not an idiot.

755
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:47,569
Katie,
l got to tell you something

756
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:51,165
and l should've told you
a long time ago.

757
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:54,973
l think...

758
00:50:55,112 --> 00:50:57,808
you're kind...

759
00:50:57,882 --> 00:51:01,249
beautiful... and talented

760
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:04,685
and l... l love you.

761
00:51:04,755 --> 00:51:06,620
What?

762
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:12,590
Uh... l'm in love with you.

763
00:51:12,663 --> 00:51:15,393
l think l've always
been in love with you.

764
00:51:15,466 --> 00:51:17,093
Harrison...

765
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:20,466
But, you know,
you don't have to say anything.

766
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,367
You're great...

767
00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:30,812
and... you're kind and organized

768
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,315
and one of the smartest
people l know

769
00:51:33,384 --> 00:51:36,376
and anyone would be so lucky
to be with you.

770
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:44,717
Harrison... Harrison...

771
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:14,433
l go away for a while
and look what happens.

772
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:18,140
You let the whole place
fall apart.

773
00:54:19,983 --> 00:54:21,575
The police are looking for you.

774
00:54:21,652 --> 00:54:24,450
l don't really want to talk
to the police right now.

775
00:54:24,521 --> 00:54:26,751
You've been messing
with me for two weeks.

776
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:28,621
More like three.

777
00:54:28,692 --> 00:54:30,182
You're proud of yourself?

778
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,591
You think this is fun?

779
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:33,425
Katie, look...

780
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:37,763
This... this isn't
going to work.

781
00:54:41,538 --> 00:54:43,631
What happened to you?

782
00:54:43,707 --> 00:54:45,197
Where have you been?

783
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:46,572
l went traveling--

784
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:49,942
lndia... Asia.

785
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:52,345
l lived and worked.

786
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:54,816
l made my own money.

787
00:54:54,885 --> 00:54:58,184
l had to see
what was out there

788
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:00,815
to know the value
of what is here...

789
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:03,689
the value of this.

790
00:55:22,913 --> 00:55:26,872
Do you know
what my big goal has been?

791
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:29,475
lt's been to stop thinking...

792
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:30,679
to not think

793
00:55:30,754 --> 00:55:33,587
to not think that every time
the phone rang it was you!

794
00:55:33,657 --> 00:55:35,522
To not think that
every piece of mail

795
00:55:35,592 --> 00:55:36,923
in my mailbox was from you!

796
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,618
To not think

797
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:41,061
that every person
l'd see approaching was you.

798
00:55:41,131 --> 00:55:43,031
l thought about you
every bit as much

799
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,362
as you thought about me.

800
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:46,925
l don't believe you.

801
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:50,972
Katie l was afraid
to say this before.

802
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:58,311
l love you.

803
00:56:28,645 --> 00:56:30,442
Katie.

804
00:56:31,815 --> 00:56:34,079
Hi, Katie Burke.

805
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:35,482
Do you know anything

806
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:37,918
about somebody being
in the tunnel?

807
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:41,924
Because the door was open
and it's not supposed to be open

808
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:44,585
and it's to remain closed
at all times

809
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:46,390
unless you're maintenance

810
00:56:46,463 --> 00:56:49,364
and you haven't been around
to ask about it

811
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:51,094
and l'm supposed to ask.

812
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:55,298
No, l don't. l'm busy.

813
00:56:55,372 --> 00:56:57,101
That's not very nice.

814
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:02,579
Should l tell you what l know?

815
00:57:02,646 --> 00:57:06,377
l was going to, but now maybe
l've changed my mind.

816
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:09,442
What are you talking about?

817
00:57:10,921 --> 00:57:15,654
Harrison Hobart is missing.

818
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,987
That's two, isn't it?

819
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:24,794
Embry is definitely back.

820
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,358
l know l should've told you
right away

821
00:57:26,436 --> 00:57:27,596
but l'm overdue on my thesis

822
00:57:27,671 --> 00:57:30,606
which is essentially one long
string of endless numbers

823
00:57:30,674 --> 00:57:31,902
and finals are coming up

824
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:33,566
and Embry has always had

825
00:57:33,644 --> 00:57:36,670
a sort of... chemical aversion
to Harry Hobart

826
00:57:36,747 --> 00:57:39,545
and l don't... l don't know
if he would do anything.

827
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:42,642
l mean, he might, but this...
this whole experience is

828
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:44,914
so far out of my normal range
of things.

829
00:57:45,055 --> 00:57:46,147
Okay, slow down.

830
00:57:46,223 --> 00:57:48,020
Are you saying that Embry

831
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:50,787
might have done something
to Harrison?

832
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:54,194
l don't know.

833
00:57:54,264 --> 00:57:55,595
l'm not sure.

834
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:58,931
l don't know why l feel
so comfortable with you.

835
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:00,663
l know that l shouldn't.

836
00:58:00,737 --> 00:58:02,568
God, what am l doing here?

837
00:58:08,178 --> 00:58:10,009
lt's okay.

838
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,775
No, it's not.

839
00:58:17,854 --> 00:58:22,052
Get down on it,
get down on it

840
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,559
Get down on it,
get down on it...

841
00:58:24,628 --> 00:58:27,028
lf somebody told me
this was the rest of my life

842
00:58:27,097 --> 00:58:28,758
l think l'd kill myself
right now.

843
00:58:28,832 --> 00:58:30,459
This isn't the rest
of your life.

844
00:58:30,534 --> 00:58:31,466
This is right now.

845
00:58:31,535 --> 00:58:32,524
Yeah, well, right now

846
00:58:32,602 --> 00:58:34,160
my friends are
out somewhere else

847
00:58:34,237 --> 00:58:35,829
and they're having a great time.

848
00:58:35,906 --> 00:58:37,840
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

849
00:58:37,908 --> 00:58:38,840
Your old friends.

850
00:58:38,909 --> 00:58:41,844
Yeah.

851
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:43,402
l'm just blowing off steam.

852
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,674
l'm sorry, all right?

853
00:58:44,748 --> 00:58:48,377
So what's up
with the Larkin kid, huh?

854
00:58:48,452 --> 00:58:51,012
Apparently he had
a car waiting-- a CTS Limo.

855
00:58:51,088 --> 00:58:53,556
lt was supposed to take him
to the airport.

856
00:58:53,623 --> 00:58:54,555
He never got in.

857
00:58:54,624 --> 00:58:56,421
Never used the airline tickets.

858
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:58,393
The girlfriend says he's back.

859
00:58:58,462 --> 00:59:02,091
What's this girl like, Wade?

860
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,395
What do you mean?

861
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:06,993
ls she a nice girl?

862
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,002
Yeah.

863
00:59:08,071 --> 00:59:09,299
Smart?

864
00:59:09,373 --> 00:59:11,204
What do you think? Yeah.

865
00:59:11,274 --> 00:59:13,765
What about you, Wade?

866
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:15,573
Are you smart?

867
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:20,545
Harrison is
a responsible young man

868
00:59:20,617 --> 00:59:23,245
and we know he holds you
in high regard.

869
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,083
He thinks of you
as a confidante.

870
00:59:25,155 --> 00:59:26,383
This is so unlike him.

871
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:29,084
We're obviously very worried.

872
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:32,925
lf there's anything at all
you could tell us...

873
00:59:34,464 --> 00:59:37,900
l don't know where Harrison is.

874
00:59:37,968 --> 00:59:39,560
l'm as worried as you are.

875
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:41,604
This is difficult for me to ask

876
00:59:41,671 --> 00:59:44,435
and in no way
am l impugning you.

877
00:59:44,508 --> 00:59:47,102
Was Harrison using drugs?

878
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,413
What?

879
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:58,215
He missed his father's birthday.

880
00:59:58,288 --> 01:00:01,917
Can you think of anyone
he might have gone to visit...

881
01:00:01,992 --> 01:00:07,020
any new friends...
people we don't know about?

882
01:00:07,097 --> 01:00:10,464
Uh, Harrison doesn't even
drink coffee.

883
01:00:10,534 --> 01:00:12,934
He worries about damaging
the instrument.

884
01:00:13,003 --> 01:00:14,698
We're grasping for anything.

885
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:21,103
l'm sure that there is...
some explanation.

886
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:27,115
What do you think you're doing?

887
01:00:27,184 --> 01:00:28,276
Finding you.

888
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:31,149
Do you know where Harrison is?

889
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:33,485
The tree-hugger?

890
01:00:33,557 --> 01:00:34,956
l don't really keep tabs on him.

891
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:36,151
Have you seen him lately?

892
01:00:36,226 --> 01:00:38,194
Wouldn't you like to know.

893
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:41,424
You piss me off
like nobody else, you know that?

894
01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:42,430
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

895
01:00:42,499 --> 01:00:44,160
What you going to do about it?

896
01:00:44,234 --> 01:00:48,796
l want you to come away with me
to the country house.

897
01:00:48,872 --> 01:00:50,430
Where is Harrison?

898
01:00:50,507 --> 01:00:53,601
l'll tell you
at the country house.

899
01:00:57,681 --> 01:01:01,048
Sure he was in love with her.

900
01:01:01,117 --> 01:01:02,744
Harrison's a good guy.

901
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:05,447
He mooned around,
but he was sweet.

902
01:01:05,522 --> 01:01:08,184
He got his name
on scientific papers

903
01:01:08,258 --> 01:01:09,850
when he was about 12.

904
01:01:09,926 --> 01:01:12,622
So, what did he know
about anything?

905
01:01:12,696 --> 01:01:15,426
Do you think it was odd
that he still liked a girl

906
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:18,696
who hadn't shown him any real
interest in over two years?

907
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:23,568
l thought it was
the opposite of odd.

908
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:29,840
Guys are drawn to her
like bugs around a bug lamp.

909
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:33,212
For four years, l've had
the privilege of watching it.

910
01:01:33,283 --> 01:01:34,910
That bother you, Julie?

911
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:41,586
Think you see the horns
of jealousy?

912
01:01:41,658 --> 01:01:43,956
You got my angle?

913
01:01:44,027 --> 01:01:47,758
You might want to ask yourself
why you're so interested in her.

914
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:52,097
They think it's
a coltish vulnerability

915
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:54,762
but it's just self-obsession.

916
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:58,205
The pea brain says,
''She needs saving''

917
01:01:58,275 --> 01:02:01,836
and the pea brain says,
''l can save her''

918
01:02:01,912 --> 01:02:04,676
and then she doesn't
notice them.

919
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:08,149
So, they go crazy.

920
01:02:08,218 --> 01:02:12,780
lt's about the missing dad
and... validation.

921
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:17,126
She just needs a friend.

922
01:03:27,964 --> 01:03:29,727
Embry.

923
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,138
Embry!

924
01:03:45,215 --> 01:03:49,049
Detective.

925
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,519
What are you doing here?

926
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:53,783
Oh, right.

927
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:56,052
Stalking Katie, l remember.

928
01:03:56,126 --> 01:04:00,324
Listen, l'm...
l'm looking for her.

929
01:04:00,397 --> 01:04:02,592
l think this kid,
Embry Larkin, is back.

930
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:03,724
Who told you that?

931
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,893
She told you that Embry's back?

932
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:07,026
She's seen him?

933
01:04:07,103 --> 01:04:09,697
Do you think she's
with him right now?

934
01:04:09,773 --> 01:04:11,900
l know. l'll keep
asking you questions

935
01:04:11,975 --> 01:04:13,806
and you keep
not answering them.

936
01:04:13,877 --> 01:04:16,573
Look, l'm just concerned
about her.

937
01:04:22,686 --> 01:04:25,314
Detective, you seem like
a pretty good guy--

938
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:27,754
you do, you do--

939
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:31,851
but Embry was the
love of her life.

940
01:04:31,928 --> 01:04:34,590
Ouch!

941
01:04:34,664 --> 01:04:38,065
He who snatched the maidenhead
from the maiden.

942
01:04:38,134 --> 01:04:39,761
l shouldn't have said that.

943
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:41,929
Do you want to come upstairs
and have a drink?

944
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:49,200
Bad Samantha! Bad Sam!

945
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:51,372
l better go now.

946
01:05:47,103 --> 01:05:49,765
You fell asleep.

947
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:53,002
lt's been a long time
since l've watched you sleep.

948
01:07:19,395 --> 01:07:21,795
Where were we?

949
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:33,598
Oh, no.

950
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:38,511
-What did you do to Harrison?
-What did you do to Harrison?

951
01:07:44,654 --> 01:07:46,417
What did you do to him?

952
01:07:52,695 --> 01:07:54,356
Evisceration.

953
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:55,590
Vivisection.

954
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:56,927
Drawn and quartered.

955
01:07:58,167 --> 01:08:00,328
The quartering act.
Dismemberment.

956
01:08:00,403 --> 01:08:02,803
And set him on fire.

957
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:06,000
You arrogant, preening... bore!

958
01:08:11,514 --> 01:08:14,881
Who are you running back to,
Katie?

959
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:16,282
Not the tree-hugger.

960
01:08:16,352 --> 01:08:17,614
Not the townie cop.

961
01:08:17,687 --> 01:08:20,315
You're already
the young professional--

962
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:24,156
passionless, desiccated....

963
01:08:24,227 --> 01:08:25,694
smug.

964
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:43,440
He slipped that under my door
a couple of nights ago.

965
01:08:43,513 --> 01:08:45,481
Where's the old place?

966
01:08:53,957 --> 01:08:55,219
Suite 408.

967
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,692
l'm sorry.

968
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:01,594
l should have told you sooner.

969
01:09:01,664 --> 01:09:03,256
Can l keep this?

970
01:09:05,635 --> 01:09:06,863
And l saw him again.

971
01:09:07,003 --> 01:09:11,235
l went to his country house.

972
01:09:11,307 --> 01:09:14,606
l told him l never wanted
to see him again.

973
01:09:14,677 --> 01:09:16,736
Well, l want to see him.

974
01:09:16,813 --> 01:09:18,838
l need to see this guy.

975
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:26,585
Detective, please do me a favor.

976
01:09:26,656 --> 01:09:28,647
Sure.

977
01:10:04,961 --> 01:10:08,055
l'm done.

978
01:10:08,131 --> 01:10:09,826
Everyone's done.

979
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:11,298
l'm not done.

980
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:12,925
Detective!

981
01:10:13,002 --> 01:10:16,938
You should arrest that man.

982
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,405
lt's medicinal-- glaucoma.

983
01:10:18,474 --> 01:10:19,736
l've got a prescription.

984
01:10:19,809 --> 01:10:22,107
Just don't play
any Grateful Dead

985
01:10:22,178 --> 01:10:23,839
or you're all going in.

986
01:10:23,913 --> 01:10:25,881
Okay, we'll try not to.

987
01:12:12,355 --> 01:12:14,585
Hey, Jed, what do you say?

988
01:12:14,657 --> 01:12:16,056
Hey, long time, no see, Handler.

989
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,855
Listen, if you're not too busy
dipping into the drug seizures

990
01:12:18,928 --> 01:12:20,691
you want to take a look at these
for me?

991
01:12:20,763 --> 01:12:24,062
Do a little compare and contrast
of the handwriting.

992
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:25,395
''My summer vacation.

993
01:12:25,468 --> 01:12:27,936
Working for the
Supreme Court Justice.''

994
01:12:28,004 --> 01:12:28,936
l bet he got in.

995
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,935
Thanks, Jed.

996
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:32,267
Hey, Handler, are you happy?

997
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:33,968
You seem happy.

998
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:36,803
Last Chance Dance?

999
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:39,279
Yeah, that's where they
call the wonks

1000
01:12:39,348 --> 01:12:42,249
out of their cubbyholes
and try to mate them.

1001
01:12:42,318 --> 01:12:43,910
That would be you.

1002
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:46,045
Wonks?
l'm a scientist. Pure science.

1003
01:12:46,122 --> 01:12:47,089
lt's sexy.

1004
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:48,384
Very sexy.

1005
01:12:48,457 --> 01:12:50,186
Yeah, you want to go?

1006
01:12:50,259 --> 01:12:52,955
Did she just ask me out?

1007
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:54,585
l believe so.

1008
01:12:54,664 --> 01:12:55,596
l'll go.

1009
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:57,565
Katie! Oh, my God.

1010
01:12:57,633 --> 01:12:58,930
Look what came!

1011
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:00,628
You got the job!

1012
01:13:00,703 --> 01:13:03,729
l didn't look at this at all.

1013
01:13:03,806 --> 01:13:06,104
There's a card in it.

1014
01:13:06,175 --> 01:13:07,472
$10,000?

1015
01:13:07,543 --> 01:13:10,910
For what,
shipping all of your antiques?

1016
01:13:11,013 --> 01:13:12,446
Airline tickets?

1017
01:13:18,187 --> 01:13:20,553
Bob?

1018
01:13:25,328 --> 01:13:26,761
Oh, come on.

1019
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:29,491
Don't be one of those
annoying people who wins

1020
01:13:29,565 --> 01:13:31,829
then acts like winning
doesn't matter.

1021
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,067
Are you okay?

1022
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:41,075
Yeah.

1023
01:13:41,143 --> 01:13:44,738
You know, you could've told me
that Embry was back.

1024
01:13:44,814 --> 01:13:47,078
l know.

1025
01:13:49,185 --> 01:13:53,713
You're thinking about the cop,
aren't you?

1026
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:55,120
Maybe.

1027
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:58,456
Okay, visualize this with me.

1028
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,085
You're down in New York

1029
01:14:00,162 --> 01:14:03,290
consulting with Lou Gerstner
or the head of GE

1030
01:14:03,366 --> 01:14:06,665
telling them how to buy
South American countries

1031
01:14:06,736 --> 01:14:09,296
but on the weekends
you fly back up here

1032
01:14:09,372 --> 01:14:11,897
to hang out with the cop,
do cop things

1033
01:14:11,974 --> 01:14:13,464
maybe go to cop mixers.

1034
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:16,136
l like the cop.

1035
01:14:16,212 --> 01:14:19,181
Yeah, um, l can see that.

1036
01:14:24,987 --> 01:14:28,354
How much money
do detectives make?

1037
01:14:28,424 --> 01:14:32,190
Didn't your mother tell you
that's a rude question to ask?

1038
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,695
No. She was always
asking people that.

1039
01:14:34,764 --> 01:14:37,824
lf l guess right,
do l get a prize?

1040
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,958
Maybe.

1041
01:14:41,237 --> 01:14:43,933
A million bucks.

1042
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,940
l didn't want to insult you.

1043
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:48,169
You're not going to insult me.

1044
01:14:48,244 --> 01:14:51,338
Look, you don't do police work
for the money.

1045
01:14:51,414 --> 01:14:52,938
What do you do it for?

1046
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:54,414
l don't know really.

1047
01:14:54,483 --> 01:14:57,611
Most people do it because
that's what their fathers' did.

1048
01:14:57,687 --> 01:14:59,211
ls that what your father did?

1049
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:01,722
He was a teacher.

1050
01:16:08,758 --> 01:16:12,524
Hey. Hey...

1051
01:16:12,595 --> 01:16:15,189
Oh... l guess l was dreaming.

1052
01:16:15,264 --> 01:16:17,892
l was... just having a dream.

1053
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,639
What are you thinking about?

1054
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,075
That l just woke up

1055
01:16:29,145 --> 01:16:31,909
next to a girl
that l don't really know

1056
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:33,639
and l'm not hungover.

1057
01:16:37,153 --> 01:16:39,087
How does that feel?

1058
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:47,158
Like free-falling through space.

1059
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:02,141
Can l tell you something
and you won't get mad?

1060
01:17:05,948 --> 01:17:09,145
You don't seem like a cop to me.

1061
01:17:09,218 --> 01:17:11,880
You don't seem
that happy doing it.

1062
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:15,856
Can l tell you something?

1063
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:18,826
l'm thinking about quitting.

1064
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:20,885
What would you do?

1065
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:26,332
l'd probably go up to my cabin
and hammer some nails

1066
01:17:26,402 --> 01:17:28,529
figure out the meaning of life.

1067
01:17:28,604 --> 01:17:31,198
Okay, l'll come.

1068
01:17:31,273 --> 01:17:34,037
l didn't ask you yet.

1069
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:36,202
Sure, you did.

1070
01:17:36,312 --> 01:17:40,442
l feel like an anvil has been
removed from my ankle.

1071
01:17:40,516 --> 01:17:42,484
Finishing your thesis?

1072
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:46,112
Finishing my thesis,
school, everything.

1073
01:17:46,188 --> 01:17:48,679
That's a good thing.

1074
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:54,559
You know, um... l know you're
moving down to New York

1075
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:59,693
after graduation, and...

1076
01:17:59,768 --> 01:18:03,329
the transition
from school can be tough.

1077
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:08,035
So l want you to know
you can always call me, okay?

1078
01:18:09,912 --> 01:18:11,971
'Cause l'm down there a lot,
and...

1079
01:18:12,047 --> 01:18:15,847
l mean, l was actually wondering
if maybe, um...

1080
01:18:17,887 --> 01:18:20,355
...if l could call you.

1081
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:31,558
l was nervous about telling you
that l'm feeling better

1082
01:18:31,634 --> 01:18:35,570
and that l won't be needing
to see you anymore.

1083
01:18:37,273 --> 01:18:39,741
Thank you for making it easier.

1084
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,640
Hey, Handler.

1085
01:18:49,718 --> 01:18:51,310
Hey, Jed.

1086
01:18:53,022 --> 01:18:55,149
You really off the job?

1087
01:18:55,224 --> 01:18:56,248
l really am.

1088
01:18:56,325 --> 01:18:58,486
You probably don't care
but the samples were a match.

1089
01:18:58,561 --> 01:19:01,029
The same person wrote the flyer
and the college application.

1090
01:19:01,096 --> 01:19:02,256
Well, that's just aces, Jed.

1091
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:03,389
You keep up the good work.

1092
01:19:03,465 --> 01:19:05,433
See you around.

1093
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,869
Only thing is... ink tests show

1094
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:13,875
that the note was written
two years ago, not last week.

1095
01:19:25,788 --> 01:19:27,585
You people are derivative.

1096
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:30,750
You're not viewing
a representation of hell.

1097
01:19:30,826 --> 01:19:31,758
You are hell.

1098
01:19:31,827 --> 01:19:36,161
You haven't produced
a real artist in over a decade.

1099
01:19:42,037 --> 01:19:44,335
...Screw this play...

1100
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:47,500
and screw you people.

1101
01:20:15,137 --> 01:20:19,164
Uh... the last time l checked,
a weekend lasted two days.

1102
01:20:19,241 --> 01:20:20,173
Am l wrong?

1103
01:20:20,242 --> 01:20:22,107
Did we switch
to a French workweek

1104
01:20:22,177 --> 01:20:23,439
while l wasn't looking?

1105
01:20:23,512 --> 01:20:24,740
Oh, look who's jealous.

1106
01:20:24,813 --> 01:20:25,905
ls there electricity

1107
01:20:25,981 --> 01:20:28,814
or will you be using the light
from the fireplace?

1108
01:20:28,884 --> 01:20:29,908
l don't mean to pry

1109
01:20:29,985 --> 01:20:32,180
but when do they want you
to show up at McKinsey?

1110
01:20:32,254 --> 01:20:33,278
l'm not sure.

1111
01:20:33,355 --> 01:20:34,322
Absolutely not.

1112
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:36,551
What do you mean
you're not sure?

1113
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,058
l mean l don't know.

1114
01:20:38,127 --> 01:20:39,287
l haven't heard.

1115
01:20:43,298 --> 01:20:46,267
Okay, uh, listen.

1116
01:20:46,335 --> 01:20:50,237
Don't flip out but l'm thinking
of deferring it for a year.

1117
01:20:50,305 --> 01:20:51,329
What?

1118
01:20:51,407 --> 01:20:53,341
lt's only a year.

1119
01:20:53,409 --> 01:20:55,400
l'm burned out.
l'm tired.

1120
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:57,672
What's this cop done to you?

1121
01:20:57,746 --> 01:21:02,149
He hasn't done anything.

1122
01:21:02,217 --> 01:21:05,277
Well...
maybe a little something.

1123
01:21:05,354 --> 01:21:08,812
He doesn't even know
this is what l'm thinking.

1124
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:10,085
l think go with him.

1125
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,821
So what if it takes up
a year of your life?

1126
01:21:12,895 --> 01:21:14,362
l mean, God, everybody thinks

1127
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:16,455
that everything has
to be so planned out

1128
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:18,363
you know, like our life is
on a rail

1129
01:21:18,434 --> 01:21:20,163
and one misstep,
it all goes away.

1130
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:23,500
Basically...

1131
01:21:23,572 --> 01:21:26,507
who knows?

1132
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:30,170
The last time you were this
irrational was with Embry.

1133
01:21:30,245 --> 01:21:33,078
Maybe that was the last time
l was happy.

1134
01:23:00,068 --> 01:23:02,628
Well, so l just said,
''The hell with it.''

1135
01:23:02,704 --> 01:23:04,831
Then l went
and climbed a mountain

1136
01:23:04,907 --> 01:23:06,898
but l didn't bring enough water.

1137
01:23:07,042 --> 01:23:08,907
So l got
a little disorientated

1138
01:23:09,044 --> 01:23:12,104
and the state police had to come
and pick me up.

1139
01:23:12,181 --> 01:23:16,880
lt was really more embarrassing
than anything else.

1140
01:23:16,952 --> 01:23:18,283
Oh, um...

1141
01:23:18,353 --> 01:23:21,481
Whatever happened
with that cop, right?

1142
01:23:21,557 --> 01:23:24,924
'Cause he was
kind of sweet on you, or...?

1143
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:27,051
Um... l don't know.

1144
01:23:27,129 --> 01:23:30,257
l think he's in New Hampshire.

1145
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:32,391
Oh.

1146
01:23:32,467 --> 01:23:35,231
Well, New Hampshire's nice
this time of year.

1147
01:23:35,304 --> 01:23:37,772
l've changed my mind,
l've changed my mind

1148
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,900
Yeah,
l've changed my mind, oh...

1149
01:23:56,758 --> 01:23:58,885
Come on... come on.

1150
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:03,591
lt doesn't like
to move the large numbers.

1151
01:24:03,665 --> 01:24:05,724
Did you ever think you'd be up
this late

1152
01:24:05,801 --> 01:24:07,393
restructuring a media company?

1153
01:24:07,469 --> 01:24:09,596
l thought l was going
to be a rock star.

1154
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:39,292
l won't make stupid threats

1155
01:25:39,361 --> 01:25:41,829
but you're not going
to run away with this guy

1156
01:25:41,897 --> 01:25:45,333
because wherever you go,
l can follow you...

1157
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,392
even if it's to the woods
in New Hampshire.

1158
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:56,939
Why don't you yell?

1159
01:25:57,045 --> 01:25:58,672
Come on, l dare you.

1160
01:26:17,599 --> 01:26:19,157
Hey, hey, are you okay?

1161
01:26:19,234 --> 01:26:21,634
What's the matter?

1162
01:26:21,703 --> 01:26:23,034
Let's just leave.

1163
01:26:23,105 --> 01:26:24,094
What happened?

1164
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:29,842
He was here.

1165
01:26:29,911 --> 01:26:31,310
Who? Embry?

1166
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,711
Well, where is he?

1167
01:26:32,781 --> 01:26:33,839
Where'd he go?

1168
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:37,851
l'll take care
of this right now.

1169
01:26:37,919 --> 01:26:41,855
No, don't.
That's what he wants.

1170
01:26:41,923 --> 01:26:43,413
He'll hurt you.

1171
01:26:45,394 --> 01:26:47,123
Just wait here.

1172
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:06,674
Why don't you join us?

1173
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:12,586
You're going to be great.

1174
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,533
You shouldn't be in here.

1175
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:29,593
l'm coming with you.

1176
01:27:29,671 --> 01:27:32,003
Well, where do you think he is?

1177
01:27:32,074 --> 01:27:33,166
He's right there.

1178
01:27:35,277 --> 01:27:38,735
Hey.

1179
01:27:38,814 --> 01:27:39,906
Embry, stop!

1180
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:42,415
l want to talk to you!

1181
01:27:56,631 --> 01:27:58,622
Hey, Embry?

1182
01:28:13,215 --> 01:28:14,239
Hey, Embry?

1183
01:28:17,052 --> 01:28:18,747
Come on out.

1184
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:19,787
l'm a police officer.

1185
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:20,981
l've got a gun.

1186
01:28:21,056 --> 01:28:23,183
l don't want to hurt you.

1187
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:39,438
Embry?

1188
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,672
Hey.

1189
01:28:44,746 --> 01:28:47,579
l heard what you said up there.

1190
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:48,843
lt was amazing.

1191
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:51,647
lt was
an incredible performance.

1192
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,746
l wasn't... acting.

1193
01:28:54,823 --> 01:28:57,951
But we're... leaving together.

1194
01:29:04,533 --> 01:29:07,400
Stick with finance, Katie.

1195
01:29:07,469 --> 01:29:08,936
lt's what you're good at.

1196
01:29:10,872 --> 01:29:11,930
Embry!

1197
01:29:19,247 --> 01:29:20,305
Embry!

1198
01:29:23,785 --> 01:29:25,252
Embry, wait!

1199
01:29:26,855 --> 01:29:28,652
We're leaving together.

1200
01:29:28,723 --> 01:29:30,520
You think l'd take you
to Europe?

1201
01:29:30,592 --> 01:29:32,423
You'd just stand around
awkwardly

1202
01:29:32,494 --> 01:29:34,052
and l'd feel sorry for you.

1203
01:29:34,129 --> 01:29:36,495
l love you!

1204
01:29:36,565 --> 01:29:38,294
Really?

1205
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:40,834
We made love right over there.

1206
01:29:40,902 --> 01:29:43,837
And now l can't get away
from you fast enough.

1207
01:29:43,905 --> 01:29:44,929
Embry!

1208
01:29:47,209 --> 01:29:48,699
Look at you.

1209
01:29:48,777 --> 01:29:51,177
You have no grace.

1210
01:29:51,246 --> 01:29:52,178
What are you doing?!

1211
01:29:52,247 --> 01:29:55,239
Crazy bitch.

1212
01:29:55,317 --> 01:29:57,251
You can't come with me.

1213
01:30:00,388 --> 01:30:01,582
Embry, why are you doing this?!

1214
01:30:01,656 --> 01:30:04,625
Look at me!

1215
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:05,751
Embry!

1216
01:30:05,827 --> 01:30:07,556
Katie!

1217
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:11,731
There's no one there.

1218
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,031
There's no one.

1219
01:30:15,103 --> 01:30:16,934
No one.

1220
01:30:25,847 --> 01:30:28,179
We're not going away together,
are we?

1221
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,617
We're not going to New Hampshire
together, are we?

1222
01:30:31,686 --> 01:30:32,812
We'll get you help, okay?

1223
01:30:32,887 --> 01:30:34,149
-No. Listen.
-l want to come.

1224
01:30:34,222 --> 01:30:35,211
l want to go with you.

1225
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:36,222
You'll be okay.

1226
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:37,724
l want to go with you.

1227
01:30:37,792 --> 01:30:39,521
Katie, you can't come with me.

1228
01:32:11,286 --> 01:32:12,810
Look.

1229
01:32:12,887 --> 01:32:15,617
That's pretty.

1230
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:19,023
There's snow on the roofs.

1231
01:32:22,530 --> 01:32:25,021
Katie, listen.

1232
01:32:27,635 --> 01:32:30,331
l'm this close
to making partner.

1233
01:32:33,308 --> 01:32:37,039
We both know the rules
about interoffice romance.

1234
01:32:37,112 --> 01:32:39,945
l wish we could keep seeing
each other

1235
01:32:40,081 --> 01:32:43,539
but it's just not worth
the risk.

1236
01:32:43,618 --> 01:32:46,086
l hope we can still be friends.

1237
01:33:04,539 --> 01:33:07,565
La-la-la

1238
01:33:07,642 --> 01:33:11,078
La-la la-la-la

1239
01:33:13,348 --> 01:33:19,514
La-la, la, la,
la-la la, la, la, la...

1240
01:33:22,657 --> 01:33:25,524
La-la-la

1241
01:33:25,593 --> 01:33:29,461
La-la la-la-la

1242
01:33:31,699 --> 01:33:37,695
La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la...

1243
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:46,340
La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la...

1244
01:34:42,003 --> 01:34:47,873
La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la...
