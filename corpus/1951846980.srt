1
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,345
Welcome again.

2
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,076
It is a beautiful autumn morning
here in the County of Flagstaff.

3
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,246
I Am Marlene Love
and this is 104.7 KWVF...

4
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,380
...the sounds of the South.

5
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,787
As many of you they know...

6
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,951
...Halloween is to the turn
of the corner...

7
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:11,224
...and here in the County of Flagstaff,
Halloween is serious thing.

8
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,765
During the following hour
we will receive people's calls...

9
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,529
...that he/she wants to share
their fearful experiences...

10
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,571
...with some of the more ones
thrilling legends...

11
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,970
...of Halloween of West Virginia.

12
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,598
I know that when he/she was girl...

13
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,439
...I always got scared
the stable of my grandparents...

14
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,343
...specially at night.

15
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,678
For a lot of time I believed
that the same cuckoo...

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,379
...he/she lived in a pile of hay
behind my grandfather's tractor.

17
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,547
Some nights
he/she went there undercover...

18
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,114
...and he/she could swear that he/she heard it breathe...

19
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:43,526
...through the old splints
of the stable, waiting for me.

20
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,157
But now we have Henry
in the line two.

21
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,997
Henry says that he wants to share
a legend of West Virginia...

22
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,835
...that it is and I mention it
literally 100% truth.

23
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,340
Henry, you are in the air
with Marlene Love.

24
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,603
Count us your thrilling history.

25
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,477
What I will be, Marlene,
it is not a thrilling history.

26
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,981
No?

27
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,677
You are for sure you called
to the correct program?

28
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,346
What I will be is true.

29
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,753
It is this way, our operator told it to us.

30
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:15,453
Count us then which this is
real legend of West Virginia.

31
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:20,528
In the forest there is
a giant man...

32
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,997
...a man with the face
so destroyed...

33
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,937
...that he/she covers it completely
with a mold of plaster.

34
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,497
Go, Henry, goes more slowly.

35
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,204
Of what forest languages?

36
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,406
Not I can tell it to you.

37
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,312
Why not?

38
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:41,012
Because I don't want that nobody goes there.

39
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,918
Where?

40
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,980
To their territory.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,585
Good, Henry, waits;
you say that there is a man...

42
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,788
...with a great mold of plaster
white in the head...

43
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,354
...that he/she lives in some part off the one
forest in West Virginia...

44
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,628
...but what there is
of thrilling in that?

45
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,000
What is there of thrilling in that?

46
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,268
That he/she is not a man.

47
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,368
He/she is a monster;
and for that reason I call you, Marlene...

48
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,470
...to notice to all
that they don't enter to the forest.

49
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:11,108
But you have not told us
in what forest.

50
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,175
That doesn't care, Marlene.

51
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,188
This man doesn't have limits...

52
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,349
...he/she doesn't have opposite.

53
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,858
Not it follows any moral code.

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,658
It can be everywhere that you are.

55
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,825
And what he/she has of monstrous
that man, that man of plaster?

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,063
If it is not indiscretion?

57
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,970
Their face doesn't have face.

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,874
Their eyes are blacker than
the darkest night of December.

59
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,139
Their hands are giant
and in form of two...

60
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,944
...as hooks to hang the meat,
of those that can destroy you.

61
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,542
Their heart, if it exists...

62
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:52,182
...it is more sterile than those
depths of the hell.

63
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:57,258
This man is the nightmare
of all boy.

64
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,995
Marlene, you remember
that at the beginning of the show...

65
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,803
...you spoke of the cuckoo that he/she lived
in the stable of your grandparents?

66
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,002
Yes, what is there with that?

67
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:15,878
This... this man is the cuckoo.

68
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,243
Shit.

69
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,407
Good, that told him/her.

70
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,911
I told him/her: "Look, if he/she wants
to reprove me, make it.

71
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,880
Not I will read a book
of 2,000 pages...

72
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,348
...to pass their final exam."

73
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,941
Kendricks played me
last spring.

74
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,418
Not it is as hard as he/she wants
to make believe that it is.

75
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,458
As you you say.
But I won't follow their class.

76
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,222
I will recapture it the next semester
with Moyer.

77
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,355
They have to stop to speak of classes
while we are on vacation.

78
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,763
Are they crazy or what does it pass them?

79
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,360
We go in route to Miami
and you speak of classes.

80
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,997
I am impatient
to nail him/her the fingernails...

81
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,200
...to some of those handsome ones
of South Beach.

82
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,038
What is there of your new boyfriend?

83
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,509
Rum.

84
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,879
Speaking of him,
he/she looks at what gave me.

85
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,715
Allow me to see it.

86
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,415
More than a ring...

87
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,855
...it seems the prize that he/she comes
in the cereal boxes.

88
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,483
Veto to the carajo.

89
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,027
I am only surprised it
that an university student...

90
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,392
...he/she can buy a stone like that.

91
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,297
He/she comes from a rich family
and privileged.

92
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,994
All your boyfriends...

93
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,231
...they come from rich families
and privileged, or not?

94
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,438
It seems then that you don't go
to have a good time in Miami.

95
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,811
Good, you already know what you/they say:

96
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,146
When the mouse is not,
the cat ago...

97
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,778
Good, like be.

98
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:18,017
Speaking of Miami,
who of you, losers...

99
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,921
...he/she knows exactly
where are we?

100
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,428
You dressed the whole traffic
that there were in 95 o'clock?

101
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,895
We were lucky of leaving us on time.

102
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,693
Also, all these
rural highways...

103
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,927
...they are parallel
to the main highway.

104
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,128
How do you know it?

105
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,330
You really want to look
a map?

106
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,135
Yes, of course.

107
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,675
While they make their foolishness,
can you park yourself?

108
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,210
I have to urinate.

109
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,325
Where are the maps?

110
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,953
In the guantera.

111
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,127
Which of all?

112
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,328
That of the states of the southeast
probably.

113
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,529
Here it is.

114
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,800
Good...

115
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,306
...now he/she finds West Virginia.

116
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,309
Here it is.

117
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,346
Maggie, you remember
how exit takes in 95 o'clock?

118
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,679
I believe that between the 34 and the 37.

119
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,685
I amused.

120
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:21,981
Thank you.

121
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,238
Yes, devils.

122
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,173
Miami, there we go.

123
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,459
What devils does it happen?

124
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,190
It is my mom's car.

125
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,232
They come to see this.

126
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,857
What is it?
Is yours?

127
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,300
I found it in that field.

128
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,167
There is money inside.

129
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,309
Man, what is all this?

130
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,641
Money free, friend;
money for Miami.

131
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,273
Money for the beach,
for the swig...

132
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,441
...for the girls.

133
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,712
It is the money of Janine
Alexander...

134
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,253
...it is not yours.

135
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,913
Whichever that is
that Janine Alexander...

136
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,253
...it is obvious that it is not desperate
to recover their handbag.

137
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,260
You look at it, it seems that ago
more than one month that is there.

138
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,355
Not you can stay it.
Not it is yours.

139
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,161
Yes, let us put it of turn
where it was...

140
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,531
...and vámonos.

141
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,127
We Go, Steve.

142
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,467
Steven, looks.

143
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,439
Here there are medicines.

144
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,066
That small poor person
he/she should be wondering...

145
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,111
...where their things are.

146
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,081
Not it is our matter.
Now yes.

147
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,742
I am sure
that he/she lives here.

148
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:37,551
There is surely
an address or something.

149
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,147
Here it is.

150
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,592
16 Sherman Hill Road,
Ellis, West Virginia.

151
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,595
Where are we?

152
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,187
Don't we know it, do you remember?

153
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,257
At least we can
to ask to somebody somewhere around.

154
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,632
Not we lose anything.

155
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,603
How you know
that it is their address?

156
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,866
It is in the first page
of their notebook, how more it could be?

157
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,875
Is somebody hungry?

158
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,205
I die from hunger.

159
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,404
He/she could eat something.

160
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,639
Good...

161
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,182
...we will stop in the next one
place that we see...

162
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,946
...we will ask to somebody there
and we follow our road.

163
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,452
Well?
Thank you.

164
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,221
How does he/she go them?

165
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,391
Very well, but
we are hungry...

166
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,832
...a lot of hunger.

167
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,961
Follow me.

168
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,875
I can sit down
to the window?

169
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,376
It happens.

170
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,175
What do they want to take?

171
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,481
For me, it dilutes.
Me the same thing.

172
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,020
Do they have lemonade?

173
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,112
Yes, clear.

174
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,316
Anything for me.

175
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,298
I not even understand
what puts here.

176
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,270
He/she knows what a God he/she will say.

177
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,101
Of what they speak
those articles?

178
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,010
It is...

179
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,375
...anything.

180
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,073
They are of ten years ago.

181
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,138
Of what are these pictures?

182
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,912
That there seems blood.

183
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,454
Not it is blood.

184
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,046
How much money there was
in the handbag?

185
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,558
$500.

186
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,424
It is a lot of money
to leave to walk.

187
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,258
Not I believe that it is necessary him/her.

188
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,788
What do you, David know?

189
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,892
If he/she needed it,
it would have continued him/her the track...

190
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,994
...or at least there was
returned to that place.

191
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,096
That money would rot us
to be useful in Miami.

192
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,471
You could pay me a masseur
with that money.

193
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,033
At least we should attempt
to make the correct thing.

194
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,511
And what is the correct thing?

195
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,172
Maggie?

196
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,014
The correct thing is that who
he/she is it it is him.

197
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,679
There is an address in the handbag;
we should attempt...

198
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,586
...to be returned it.

199
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,751
How you know that it is
the girl's address?

200
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,020
You don't know it.

201
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,094
Where is the address?

202
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,926
He/she takes.

203
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:36,263
When the waiter returns,
I will ask it to him.

204
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,429
Thank you.

205
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,336
But if he/she doesn't know it...

206
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:46,310
...we keep the money,
we throw the handbag...

207
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,541
...and we forget the matter,
of agreement?

208
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,277
That same I think.

209
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,285
Of agreement?

210
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,184
It is well.

211
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,813
Good.

212
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,790
We will order.
I am hungry.

213
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,854
What I can bring them...

214
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,988
...of eating?

215
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,363
Excuse.

216
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,902
We are lost.
Can he/she tell me where this place is?

217
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,934
Excuse,
do they look for this address?

218
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,008
Yes.

219
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,373
Not we are of here.

220
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,641
Yes, good, I sit down it.

221
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,875
I never heard speak of a town
called Ellis.

222
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,974
Where are we then?

223
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,987
In Rolling Glen, with a population
of 314 inhabitants.

224
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:33,821
As I told them, I never heard speak
of a called town Ellis.

225
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,486
Thank you.

226
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,498
What can I bring them of eating?

227
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,993
That was very useful.

228
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,096
Are you already satisfied?

229
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,697
Me yes.

230
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,541
We go in route to Miami
and we are $500 richer.

231
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:55,943
Steven?
What?

232
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,949
Can we stop once again?
Only for...

233
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,111
No, Maggie, not.
He/she listens.

234
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,451
I asked to the waiter,
that is everything.

235
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,924
Did you dress their face? Not he/she had
neither he/she devises of what we spoke.

236
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,790
He/she never heard speak of Ellis.

237
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,057
Ellis could be
to 300 miles of here.

238
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,065
We Go, Steven.

239
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,794
Maggie, listens.

240
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,099
Hundred of travelers happen
every day for this highway.

241
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,004
Not it is anything serious
and it is not my problem.

242
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,908
My problem is to return at 95 o'clock
and of there to Miami.

243
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,004
If that it was your handbag,
would not you want it of turn?

244
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,742
If it was my handbag...

245
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,716
...he/she would not have left it
to a side of the highway.

246
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,878
This well, we can stop
once again?

247
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,717
And I will give for closed the matter,
I promise it to you.

248
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,758
We go.

249
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,358
Good, it is well.
We have to put gasoline.

250
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,365
I will stop in first o'clock
station that he/she sees...

251
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,661
...but you will ask.

252
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,839
The sheriff's office
of Rolling Glen.

253
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,247
Sheriff Taggart?

254
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,444
Him same.
Who does speak?

255
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,885
Earl, is Peggy, of Pete's.

256
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,923
Hello, pretty.

257
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,016
You continue staying the eggs
fresher for my omelets, truth?

258
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,028
Earl, it has always been this way.

259
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,224
Wonderful.
What can I make for you?

260
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,790
Good, some outsiders end up
of being here...

261
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:26,634
...and they asked how to arrive
to Sherman Hill Road.

262
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,536
Were hunters?

263
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,168
No, young boys,
university students in fact.

264
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,974
Do you know what they will make somewhere around?

265
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,174
No, they didn't say it.

266
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,046
Are they still there?

267
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,848
No, they left he/she makes a while.

268
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,979
I will be in charge of of that, Peggy.

269
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,581
Earl. Earl.

270
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,023
Yes?

271
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,029
The matter is that
when asking the road...

272
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:56,431
...they asked for Ellis,
not for Rolling Glen.

273
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,629
Ellis?

274
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,433
I know it, I also stayed
astonished as...

275
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,700
Earl?

276
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,723
What devils it passes him/her
to that man?

277
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,561
What does it pass him/her?
Hello.

278
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,761
Already coarse.
He/she can that it is deaf.

279
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,498
To the devil with that type. We will look for
gasoline in another part. Impossible.

280
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:38,842
Give me one minute.
I already return.

281
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,586
It can fill the tank
with the regular one?

282
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,054
Not I have gasoline.

283
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,965
Pardon?

284
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,937
The bomb is
drier than a bone.

285
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:14,343
Where more I can
to get gasoline?

286
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,973
Not there is another place
in 50 miles to the round one...

287
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,073
...that I know.

288
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,642
But what does old Artie know?

289
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,653
It returns tomorrow afternoon.

290
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,390
Tomorrow afternoon
the gasoline will arrive.

291
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,627
It arrives every third Monday.

292
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,261
Good, thank you.

293
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:42,330
He/she can maybe help us.

294
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,440
It depends of what type
of help they look for.

295
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:53,348
Artie doesn't make miracles.

296
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,215
Artie neither is magpie...

297
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,517
...so don't request anything
related with that shit.

298
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:02,589
We only look for an address.

299
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,724
Here he/she has it.

300
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,700
Sherman Hill Road?

301
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,471
Yes, I know
Sherman Hill Road...

302
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,873
But it is not in Ellis.

303
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,176
Good, thank you anyway.

304
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,710
Ellis no longer exists, boy.

305
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,418
Undoubtedly it continues existing
the earth where was...

306
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,358
...but most of people
of here...

307
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,455
...he/she prefers to call it
Rolling Glen now.

308
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,696
Is so this Ellis?
Did they only change him/her the name?

309
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,433
That would be a summary.

310
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,975
But Ellis was different.

311
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,844
Some how many square miles
of farmers, journeymen and drunkards.

312
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,281
In that then, most
of people of the town...

313
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,909
...he/she lived up
of the mountains.

314
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,753
There it is where it is
Sherman Hill Road.

315
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,384
Although now there is no longer anything.

316
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,420
At the moment all live here
below in the town.

317
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,989
Why did they change him/her the name?

318
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,127
Why everybody lowered
of the hills?

319
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:19,898
Bad memories...

320
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,302
...and histories of ghosts.

321
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:26,140
And those they are things in those that
Artie doesn't want to participate.

322
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,703
Good, how I arrive
to that address...

323
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,078
...that I gave him/her?

324
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,709
You don't believe to Artie.

325
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,446
Not I know what to believe.

326
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,115
He/she takes this highway...

327
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,318
...some four miles.

328
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,452
At the end to the right...

329
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,428
...you will see a street without name.

330
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:49,228
I believe that the sheriff was
being about closing it completely...

331
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,532
...but I doubt that he/she has still made it.

332
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,367
It follows that highway for some miles...

333
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,805
...and to your right you will see...

334
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,866
Sherman Hill Road.

335
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,675
Well, thank you.

336
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,075
Come closer to Artie.

337
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:09,985
Pardon?

338
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,784
Allow me to see your hand.

339
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,985
What?

340
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,924
They always say that you can see
of what a man is made...

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,093
...just by looking at their hands.

342
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,908
Yes, in fact you are the man.

343
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,937
God.

344
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,133
You are sure
that it is here?

345
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:05,006
There is snow in the floor.

346
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,202
The man of the station
of gasoline...

347
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,508
...he/she said that the place was up
of the mountain.

348
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,676
Steve, that was or later
that it was about licking your fingers?

349
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,646
It is cold in the mountains.

350
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,747
When it is cold, it snows.

351
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,056
Not I know how more to tell them.

352
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,925
Also, it was not my idea.

353
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,830
But you are a better man
to make it.

354
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,233
Go, this place
it is enormous:

355
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,325
It is really big.

356
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,267
You know the parties
that we could make here?

357
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,737
Let us see if there is somebody
at home:

358
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,639
Not it seems that there was nobody.

359
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,303
Steve, seemed
that from decades...

360
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,504
...there is not nobody there.

361
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,604
Steven, we go.

362
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,218
He/she waits, I believe that I listened
to somebody to give a lash.

363
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,345
Walk you to the shit.

364
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,793
Did you call?

365
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,527
No, it is open.

366
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,331
Not there is mail.

367
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,429
Not you can enter this way.

368
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,996
Steve, lover...

369
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,167
...when we plan this trip
for the winter vacations...

370
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,143
...nobody mentioned that it would be
in the terrace of a farm...

371
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,043
..."where the devil lost the poncho",
West Virginia.

372
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,742
So personally,
he/she wanted to take advantage of the deviation...

373
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,842
...and you are being
a tremendous maricón.

374
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,823
Good, they already heard
to the lady.

375
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,987
Something is only altered.

376
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,928
Yes, something.

377
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:22,476
Hello.

378
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,879
He/she hears, we have your handbag.

379
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,181
We think that maybe
you were looking for it.

380
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,078
Not it seems that there was nobody
at home. Vámonos.

381
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,714
He/she waits,
we should stay.

382
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,884
The door was open.
It maybe passes something bad.

383
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,359
This is the field.

384
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,919
People leave the door
open the whole time.

385
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,124
Now you are being
a tremendous maricón.

386
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,426
Follow it.

387
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,301
Excellent, I have to continue
to the crazy prostitute.

388
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,501
You invited it.

389
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,044
He/she Waits, Audra.

390
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:23,033
I tell you a thing:
If somebody lives here...

391
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,406
...they forgot in what decade we are.

392
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,379
My grandmother has furniture
as these.

393
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,109
Your grandmother didn't know
in what century he/she lived.

394
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,514
What?

395
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,985
Anything.

396
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,765
Brilliant.

397
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,372
That was Audra.

398
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,503
Audra.

399
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,571
What disgust.
What did it happen?

400
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,480
He/she looks at that.

401
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,848
You should be joking.

402
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,750
No, he/she looks at this, Maggie.

403
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,822
It stinks.

404
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,553
That is disgusting.

405
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,151
Don't play it.

406
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,197
What loss of time.

407
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,960
What disgust.

408
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,861
What carajo
was that?

409
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,064
It seemed the door.

410
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,300
I won't open up.

411
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,636
We should see
who is.

412
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,142
Wait, not even
we live here.

413
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,338
We will open up. Everything is well.
You stay here.

414
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,413
Steve, we don't live here.

415
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,109
Everything is well.
Calm.

416
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,544
We should be in route to Miami...

417
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,681
...and they want to play to
the cottage and to open the door.

418
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,056
It is a house of crazy.

419
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,394
Hello.

420
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:34,029
It was point of taking
the freedom of entering.

421
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,665
Commissary Earl Taggart
of Rolling Glen.

422
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,003
Is there some problem?

423
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,135
I don't know it.
Tell it to me you.

424
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,442
He/she begins explaining to me
what devils faces in this house.

425
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,142
Good, this it is...

426
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:49,346
This is the house of my grandparents...

427
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,513
...and them... they left it to him
to my parents.

428
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,716
We came to see...

429
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,657
...that everything was in order.

430
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,322
And is everything in order?

431
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,492
Not I am sure.
We have just arrived.

432
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,059
How do you call yourself, son?

433
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,137
Steve.

434
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,333
Steve Dixon.

435
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,445
You should be the grandson
of Silas then, not?

436
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,139
Yes, Mister, it is this way.

437
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,341
What it punishes that that
did it pass him/her, not?

438
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,316
A pain.

439
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,444
He/she gives an enormous pain when
they pass him/her horrible things...

440
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,646
...to good people.

441
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,712
Yes.

442
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,351
Good, I cannot allow them
to be in this property.

443
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,294
The whole area
it is closed.

444
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,194
To anybody he/she is allowed to be here.

445
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:35,664
Why not?

446
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,963
As I said... Steve.

447
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,230
Yes, clear, Steve.

448
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,862
The highway
that it is here behind...

449
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,873
...to some four miles for this side
and seven for this other one...

450
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,705
...that whole area is closed.

451
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,075
Not it is safe
that they stay here.

452
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,239
And I cannot give myself the luxury
that it passes a tragedy...

453
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,680
...being me to the control.

454
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,183
It would not be well.

455
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,779
He/she knows, sheriff, seriously
we wanted to leave.

456
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,883
But we don't have gasoline
neither where to go.

457
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,427
So we will wait
until tomorrow...

458
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,361
...to that gasoline arrives
to the station of the town.

459
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,399
Artie Stewart?

460
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,525
Artie won't receive it
gasoline neither tomorrow...

461
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,365
...neither next week,
neither next month...

462
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,564
...neither next year.

463
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,504
That lunatic's station
it doesn't work...

464
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,134
...from the crisis of
the Cuban missiles.

465
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,905
What?

466
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,415
He/she hears, son, I cannot help you
with that of the gasoline...

467
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,542
...but I can escort you
of turn to the freeway...

468
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,644
...only we have to leave
right now.

469
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,923
Not you will want to be here
when it gets dark.

470
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,959
Here they pass incredible things
to the evening.

471
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,758
As what things?

472
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,857
In these fields there are jackals
and bears and wild animals.

473
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:47,769
Not you will want to be them
to the evening, son, believe me.

474
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,670
Jackals?

475
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,231
It is this way, jackals.

476
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,300
Here I have seen hunters...

477
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,573
...with weapons of first...

478
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,774
...and nobody has seen them
or heard again.

479
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,647
Finally we should say:
"It was already enough."..

480
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,619
...and we close the whole area.

481
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,986
It is safer this way.

482
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,048
Yes, but sheriff
we would not cause...

483
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,219
...we are not about causing
problems.

484
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,456
But these always
they seem to find...

485
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,591
...to who don't look for them,
certain is not?

486
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,966
Good, I like to know it,
sheriff.

487
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,470
What pass good night...

488
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,971
...and cuídes...

489
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:27,508
Let us see what he/she has here,
does lady abut?

490
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,515
He/she takes notes for their class
in the school?

491
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:40,318
He/she prepares a report on
the history of this area?

492
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,222
The history is good.

493
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,694
He/she becomes trained to not making
the same errors of the past.

494
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:49,893
Now, if the encounter here
when returning tonight...

495
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,959
...I will contain them to both.

496
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:55,995
So follow my advice
and vanish.

497
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,783
What was all that?

498
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,319
I believe that we end up...

499
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,379
...of knowing
the southern hospitality.

500
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,585
Not I know you, but I don't want
to pass my whole vacations...

501
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,127
...in a jail of rustic...

502
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,129
...so I suggest that we continue
their advice and we release ourselves.

503
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,596
He/she not even saw them to you.

504
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,328
How good, because people this way
in a place as this...

505
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,496
...they don't come with good eyes
to people as me.

506
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,096
Man, calm down.

507
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,974
We still have to find
to somebody that can give us gasoline.

508
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,602
There was a bar
in the highway.

509
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,045
Maybe somebody there can tell us
where to find a station.

510
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:41,142
No, I won't leave. I disgust.
I have to take a shower.

511
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,312
There are dead animals
in the drawers and things...

512
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:47,722
He/she looks, you hold back.
I want to release myself of here.

513
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,090
Somebody should stay
in case the owner returns.

514
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,423
I will stay.

515
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,464
Not you have just heard the sheriff?

516
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,556
Not there is owner.

517
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,624
He/she could have said it
to get scared.

518
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,832
Good that Audra stays.

519
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,000
Not it can be alone.

520
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,341
No, Maggie is right.

521
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,246
Good, the commissary didn't see them
to none of both.

522
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,978
If we cross with him
in the town and you see them...

523
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,816
...it will bother him/her that
we have lied him/her.

524
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,755
So it is better
that we don't provoke it.

525
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,316
Maggie and I maybe can
to find somebody in the bar...

526
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,363
...that he/she can tell us where
to find a station of gasoline.

527
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,454
It is hour of taking a shower. Do you come?

528
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,423
No, step.

529
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,619
You get lost it.

530
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,254
David?

531
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,794
David, are you?

532
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,589
David, is very cold.

533
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,822
You want to sleep in my bed
tonight?

534
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,539
David?

535
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,580
David, you arrive too much afternoon.

536
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,082
You got lost the shower.

537
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:30,283
Devils, how much will I have slept?

538
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,222
Audra!

539
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,270
Where are you?

540
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,689
I ring cheap.

541
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,358
Shit.

542
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,963
To the carajo with the ring.

543
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:36,021
Old, where it can be
that girl?

544
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,788
Good afternoon, Earl.

545
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,847
Hello, pretty.

546
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,553
Coffee?
Of course.

547
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,755
Do you know what, Peg?
Better than it is decaffeinated.

548
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,928
Then...

549
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:23,167
...do you want the customary thing?

550
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,435
That sounds well,
pretty.

551
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,740
Jerry, give me
a double omelet...

552
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:32,839
...without bacon and a portion of puree
of potatoes for the sheriff.

553
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,385
At once.

554
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,922
Is everything well, Earl?
You are very quiet.

555
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,517
Everything is well.

556
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,086
You found the boys
of those that I spoke to you?

557
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,632
Right now they are in the house
of old Dixon.

558
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:55,103
What devils are they making there?

559
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,503
One of them says to be...

560
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,405
...the grandson of Silas Dixon...

561
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,340
...but I don't believe him/her.

562
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,777
Not he/she knew that Silas...

563
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,313
...he/she had grandsons.

564
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,043
Me neither.

565
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,675
And the girl that was
with the boy...

566
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,210
...he/she had a notebook of notes
full with newspaper cuttings...

567
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,289
...on Ellis.

568
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,382
Do clip?

569
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,949
On the incident.

570
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:20,622
God, another time that of Williams.

571
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,300
There are boys in the house
of Dixon, sheriff?

572
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,360
Not it is your matter, Jerry.

573
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,771
My friends and I were accustomed to
to challenge us to see who went there.

574
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,571
For that reason it is that the half
of your high school friends...

575
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,136
...they are dead or in the jail.

576
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,375
Most of times...

577
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,283
...Frankie picked up us
in their Trans Am...

578
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,015
...after stealing him/her a recruit
of vodka to their old ones...

579
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,989
...and we left there up.

580
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,457
A couple of times was
in bicycle...

581
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:53,690
...round trip, six miles
in the total darkness.

582
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,631
Not we had been able to make it
unless there was full moon.

583
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,395
Not there is he/she swims there up.

584
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,096
Of course.

585
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,502
My friends and me
we always heard things...

586
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:06,737
...noises, noises
human real.

587
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,608
They were sometimes as wailings.

588
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,342
They were sometimes...

589
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,613
...almost as roars.

590
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:21,215
You and your friends were
hallucinating or they were drunk.

591
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,385
Not there is anything dangerous there,
except for the wild life.

592
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:27,430
It didn't scare us the life
wild, sheriff.

593
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,023
We were him/her afraid
to "face of plaster."

594
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:34,132
Not I want hear again
to never say that name.

595
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,501
Did you understand me?

596
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,439
The face of plaster is real,
sheriff, I know it!

597
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,136
I have seen it
with my own eyes.

598
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,771
You are only a terrible one
lying drunkard.

599
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,575
He/she sometimes hides
the dirt under the carpet...

600
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,450
...only for a while, sheriff.

601
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,581
It is left again of there.

602
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,784
Long of my view.

603
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,923
Audra!

604
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,007
Let us go, Audra!

605
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:38,287
We go, don't play with me.
You know that I suffer of the heart.

606
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,040
Prostitute rat.

607
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,332
Let us should maybe leave.

608
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,368
While quicker we find
somebody that helps us...

609
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,428
...quicker we will leave of here.

610
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,414
It seems that we have a couple
of faces new tonight.

611
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,690
Hello.
You smell well.

612
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:21,059
A beer, please.

613
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,826
He/she waits.

614
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,664
Not you know that it is bad education
to order before the lady?

615
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,330
What would you like, sweet lips?

616
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,102
It dilutes it is well.

617
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,542
And you, what you said that you wanted,
bad-mannered boy?

618
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,375
A beer.

619
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,382
Well, at once I bring them
two beers.

620
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,714
He/she knows where we would rot
to get gasoline?

621
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,720
Stations of gasoline?

622
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,463
All go to Monroe
to get gasoline.

623
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,126
Not there is he/she swims here.
Not the trucks arrive.

624
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,396
Why not?
He/she looks to your surroundings, girl.

625
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,995
Not he/she is a population
the sufficiently big thing.

626
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:09,943
What so far from here
is Monroe?

627
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:13,312
Monroe is some
50 miles to the south.

628
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,916
Is your girl very pretty, do you know?

629
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,425
Yes, thank you.

630
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:24,960
Hello, pretty.

631
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,792
My name is Henry.

632
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:30,731
Hello.

633
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,600
You am only
bothering.

634
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:38,674
Good...

635
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,767
...and from where do they come?

636
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,640
We are only of passing
on the way to Miami.

637
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,117
We stopped in...

638
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,087
...in Ellis...

639
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,248
...but the sheriff said
that we could not stay.

640
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,589
So only we look for somebody
that he/she helps us with the gasoline...

641
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,661
...and we release ourselves.

642
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,527
Ellis.

643
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,759
You mean Rolling Glen.

644
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,668
They told us that it was
the same place.

645
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,707
Yes, it is it.

646
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,207
It is it.

647
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,869
Although it is amusing to hear
that somebody calls it Ellis.

648
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,540
He/she makes much of that.

649
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,606
And why he/she told them
the sheriff Taggart...

650
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,379
...that they should leave?

651
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,285
He/she told us something on bears
and jackals...

652
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,915
...that they have had too many
incidents with hunters and that.

653
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,891
He/she said that the whole area
it is closed.

654
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,188
Idiocies.

655
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:36,221
And do you believe him/her?

656
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,324
Good, why would he/she lie us?

657
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,367
Son, you are not of here.

658
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,771
I will tell you the truth
on Taggart.

659
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,672
He/she is prostitute's son
more immodest...

660
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,768
...with the one that I was.

661
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:50,176
The prostitute mouth, Henry closes.

662
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,841
He/she doesn't fall well because
every week...

663
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,349
...it takes you to the jail.

664
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,579
Not you have neither he/she devises, Donnie.

665
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,849
What happens is that
I know the true history...

666
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,259
...why Taggart doesn't want
that nobody goes to Ellis.

667
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,124
In 1989...

668
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,634
...it should be ago more
of 15 years...

669
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,535
...Taggart was only a he-goat
with boy's face...

670
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,870
...beginning as
sheriff in Ellis.

671
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,968
You only had to rub him/her the ass
correctly...

672
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,377
...and he/she would help you to
that they retired the positions.

673
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,448
And your name cleaned.

674
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,676
All less you, Henry.

675
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,344
Be quiet the prostitute mouth, Donnie.

676
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,879
Anyway, one night...

677
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,322
...about this time of the year...

678
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,452
...a truck driver that managed
of Maine to Florida...

679
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,428
...he/she stops to drink something...

680
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:42,988
...a type black and big call...

681
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:45,227
...called Ray Williams.

682
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,394
You are counting him/her...

683
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,404
...Ray's history Williams
another time?

684
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,463
Of course, devils.

685
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,565
Here nobody the bill.

686
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,037
Anyway...

687
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,674
...a black truck driver
called Ray Williams...

688
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,046
...he/she stops one night
to drink something.

689
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,087
And in what bar, Henry?

690
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,348
For what I listened...

691
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,253
...it could have been this same one.

692
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:08,951
Certain that is?

693
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,049
In fact...

694
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,424
...I listened that he/she entered
and he/she sat down...

695
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,190
...in that seat of the corner.

696
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,757
You are bad of the head.

697
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,392
Ray Williams...

698
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,867
...it is very tired of managing...

699
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,962
...as, 1,000 miles
in the last 20 hours.

700
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,099
He/she enters, he/she sits down
in the corner of there.

701
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:27,302
He/she requests a beer.

702
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,777
It is at night one Friday...

703
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,370
...and all the boys
that they had worked...

704
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:32,506
...in the cornfields...

705
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,345
...they enter with the pay
in their hand:

706
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:38,148
Enough drunkards were already
when Williams arrived.

707
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:43,221
The rumors say that for
their color or what is...

708
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,394
...that Williams and some
of the boys...

709
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,487
...they began to
to exchange words.

710
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,054
The words warmed...

711
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,156
...and about ten boys...

712
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,724
...they began to hit
to the poor dog son.

713
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,929
You already see, speaking of the place
mistaken...

714
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,063
...in the mistaken moment.

715
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,336
They hit it here
during a time.

716
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,708
They took out it out.
They hit it even more.

717
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,907
Here it is where the history
it becomes interesting.

718
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,040
Seemingly they hit...

719
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,244
...to this Williams so much...

720
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,914
...that their face, no longer
you could recognize.

721
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,854
And when they finished
of hitting it...

722
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,621
...they were already passing the
drunkenness so took its body...

723
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,424
...to the old ranch Dixon
and they threw it.

724
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,627
In the house of Dixon?

725
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,262
Yes. Why?

726
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,272
Not it cares.
Not it cares.

727
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:38,371
Anyway,
some days later...

728
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:39,448
...one of them opens the mouth...

729
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,507
...and it reports the incident
to Taggart.

730
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:44,645
When the police arrived there,
they cannot find the cadaver.

731
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:48,248
Then Taggart says:
"Without cadaver, there are not tests."..

732
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,623
...and he/she testifies saying more
of the same garbage...

733
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:52,093
...in all their trials.

734
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,187
None of them
it is processed...

735
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,960
...and none spends
a contained day...

736
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,900
...and Taggart strolls as
if it was a puto super hero.

737
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,366
But after one year...

738
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,671
...two years later...

739
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,109
...they begin to happen accidents.

740
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,239
People, hunters...

741
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,442
...they leave to the corn...

742
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,883
...but they never return:

743
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,820
From time to time, the police
he/she finds a cadaver.

744
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:23,017
They usually disappear
without leaving rake.

745
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,755
So one day, about ten years ago...

746
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,956
...Taggart condemns everything
the region when they abandoned...

747
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:33,264
...and they never found the cadaver
of Ray Williams.

748
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,031
He/she looks, boy,
I know the truth.

749
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,374
The truth is that
Ray Williams is not dead.

750
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,506
For sure it is there out
eating animals to survive...

751
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:50,075
...and killing the one who
among in their territory.

752
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,645
Why he/she doesn't leave,
I don't know it.

753
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,850
Who knows in what state
their body will be...

754
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,825
...after the beating that he/she received...

755
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:02,160
...especially without treatment
doctor neither anything.

756
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:07,232
But it is alive
and it is there out.

757
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:10,372
For heaven's sake, sure
that it is angry.

758
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,399
Histories of ghosts;
it is what is.

759
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,138
The boys like to go
there to make pendejadas...

760
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,611
...to get scared each other.

761
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,343
For sure you would not go
there at night.

762
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,510
Not I have reasons
to go there.

763
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,143
I have wife and son.

764
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,051
Not I will make myself the fool
with any legend.

765
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,249
Face of plaster is not a legend.

766
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,919
Face of plaster?

767
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,757
It is this way like they call...

768
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,626
...to old Ray Williams.

769
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,722
Doesn't he/she make you laugh?

770
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:38,267
There are people that says to have seen...

771
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,529
...to a man to wander somewhere around...

772
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:42,332
...with a big plaster
on their head probably...

773
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,566
...because Ray's face Williams
it was so destroyed...

774
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:48,577
...that him same he/she tried to fix it.

775
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,670
Face of plaster?

776
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:55,083
Face of plaster is correct.

777
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,484
He/she looks, boy, to me not me
they would find there at night.

778
00:55:58,555 --> 00:55:59,715
It is all that I say.

779
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,087
You know where we can
to buy gasoline?

780
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:05,594
Boy, this pendejo
neither he/she has a car.

781
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,131
Thank you anyway.
Good night.

782
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,522
He/she Hears, Jerry.

783
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,991
I will turn off the lights
in about five minutes...

784
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,029
...is it well?

785
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,791
Not there is problem.
Almost I finished here.

786
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:45,596
I am getting ready
a bite before leaving.

787
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,768
I sit down it, we already close.

788
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,337
Look, we already close the kitchen.

789
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,775
Can he/she return tomorrow, yes?

790
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,950
Is somebody there?

791
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,856
Hello?

792
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,421
He/she Hears, Jerry,
I already leave.

793
00:59:57,493 --> 01:00:00,223
Can you close when I leave?

794
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,293
Jerry, do you hear me?

795
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,965
Devils, he/she is listening that
damned radio the whole time.

796
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,868
Jerry, I said...

797
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,487
Of what do you think?

798
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,693
Why I left me the freeway.

799
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,735
You accuse yourself to yourself
for all this?

800
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,464
I am who is managing.

801
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,634
Yes, but you tried to make
this more interesting trip.

802
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,836
Not you knew what will happen.

803
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,304
Also, I believe that the blame is mine.

804
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,247
I am who wanted
to return that stupid handbag.

805
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:59,721
Good, at least your idiot devises
it got us a place where to stay.

806
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,814
Yes, it is an old farm
that it puts fear...

807
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:04,451
...in the mean of he/she swims her
that it doesn't belong us...

808
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,428
...and in the one that you/they say that he/she inhabits
a murderer in series...

809
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,590
...but it is better than sleeping
in the car.

810
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,861
Steven, you didn't believe yourself...

811
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,902
...what those boys said
in the bar, certain?

812
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,404
No.

813
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,565
That is to say, it is only a history
local of ghosts.

814
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:19,699
Each town has one.

815
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,836
To me it didn't happen me.

816
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,903
In my town we didn't have
a history of ghosts.

817
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,711
No? Because you got lost it.

818
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,843
Seriously?

819
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,853
Good, when it was
in the primary one...

820
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,287
...our recess patio was
surrounded of forests...

821
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,587
...and all the bigger boys
they used to speak to the smallest...

822
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,286
...on a man of black...

823
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,761
...that he/she lived in the forests.

824
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:45,233
He/she had a black knife,
it dressed a black long coat...

825
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:46,928
...and he/she had a big and black dog...

826
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,437
...that he/she never barked
and it always continued him/her.

827
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,431
Yes, you laugh.

828
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,876
That God helped you if you had
that to pick up a ball in the forest.

829
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,110
We already return.

830
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,017
Did you really believe in him?

831
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,092
In who?

832
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,150
The man of black.

833
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:17,166
No, but I believe that
when you are younger...

834
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,928
...you are willing to believe you
many things...

835
01:02:19,001 --> 01:02:21,469
...but when you make yourself something bigger...

836
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:24,700
...you look for something realler.

837
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,943
My God.

838
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,418
What devils?

839
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,251
Where devils were they?

840
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,517
Calm.
We were in the bar.

841
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,785
Audra is not!

842
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:44,190
What you mean
that it is not?

843
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,854
I say that their vixen ass
it is not in the house.

844
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,089
I don't find it in any side.

845
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,496
It was supposed that they should be together.

846
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:51,566
How much does he/she make that it disappeared?

847
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,569
He/she looks, I went to bed
to sleep a nap...

848
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,035
...fair when you left.

849
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,664
When I woke up several
hours later, it was no longer.

850
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,708
Devils, calm.

851
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,300
He/she waits.

852
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,377
It grabs this.

853
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,003
Steve, is not in the house!

854
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,104
Then where it is?

855
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,205
David?

856
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,647
Not he/she has car!

857
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,184
Why would he/she leave?

858
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,276
Does that think?

859
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,353
Because he/she looks...

860
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,411
...this is what I think.

861
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,548
I believe that he/she put on their shoes
of vixen...

862
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,388
...and he/she left to the highway
main...

863
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,552
Then you got into the first car...

864
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,118
...that it was enough stupid
to brake.

865
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,391
David, that doesn't make sense.

866
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,830
Sense?

867
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,900
He/she looks...

868
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,424
...don't speak to me of sense.

869
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,436
What doesn't make sense
it is to manage...

870
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:31,701
...to the mean of he/she swims her for
to return the handbag of a girl.

871
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,264
That that non sense
it is to be here stopped...

872
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,775
...in this old house
so unpleasant...

873
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,039
...when we should be
in the beach in Miami.

874
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,546
That is it that for me
he/she doesn't make sense.

875
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,974
I leave.

876
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,611
What does it happen?

877
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:48,115
Give me the keys!

878
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,590
Devils!

879
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:55,760
We go. We go.

880
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,290
Let us go! Devils!
Not there is gasoline.

881
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,394
God!

882
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:15,050
Audra is not
in the house.

883
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,784
Did you already look up?

884
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,327
Yes, he/she makes a while.

885
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,731
Good, he/she looks another time and...

886
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,895
Maggie and I will look
here below.

887
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,530
He/she waits, I have to go
up me alone?

888
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:37,606
Yes.

889
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,208
Is it because I am black?

890
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:45,247
No, it is because it scares me
the darkness.

891
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,249
He/she really gets scared
the darkness?

892
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,915
No.

893
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,869
Afraid of the darkness?

894
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,934
Why to me not me
does it scare the darkness?

895
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,718
Not I know where it will be.

896
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,089
He/she would not leave without
to say something to somebody.

897
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,185
The sheriff maybe took it to him.

898
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,526
But why
was not it taken to David?

899
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,293
David was sleeping.

900
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,370
She was maybe out...

901
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:48,438
...and David slept while
everything happened.

902
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:51,876
It is dark out.
She would not leave somewhere around.

903
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,916
Not he/she makes sense.

904
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,559
Did you listen that?

905
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,630
The what an one?

906
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,453
It should be the seeing.

907
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,284
What devils?

908
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,625
Teeth?

909
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,574
It is disgusting.

910
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,673
Why they continue lit
the lights?

911
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,033
Peggy?

912
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,044
Today you have a special one
at night?

913
01:11:47,703 --> 01:11:48,703
My God.

914
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,836
Steven.

915
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,981
Steven.

916
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:22,019
Steven!

917
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,028
We should leave of here.

918
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,465
Vámonos, we have
that to leave of here.

919
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,559
Who is there?

920
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,103
David, vámonos!
Where is Steve?

921
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,901
We Go, David.
God!

922
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,067
David, listens, please.

923
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,236
Maggie, what does it happen?

924
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,337
Devils, you should calm down
and to tell me...

925
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,414
My God.

926
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:52,713
We go, he/she enters, he/she enters.

927
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:05,524
You should be quiet.

928
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:06,966
You have to tranquilize yourself.

929
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:08,468
Calm or he/she will discover us.

930
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,051
Is it well?

931
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,788
What will we make?

932
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,726
I don't know it, devils.

933
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,660
We should maybe escape.

934
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,255
Not I will be able to run
more than him.

935
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:42,326
Then
we are caught.

936
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:45,373
We should try to crawl
without he/she listens to us.

937
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,566
Not we can make that.

938
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:49,133
The floor is
too noisy.

939
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,473
I should attempt it.

940
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,878
No, Maggie.

941
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,916
Shit.

942
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:47,901
Run, run, run!

943
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:48,970
Run!

944
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:51,696
That nobody moves.

945
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,105
Sheriff, thanks to God that arrived.
They want to kill us.

946
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,643
Is that certain?

947
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,178
Yes, yes. Not it is joke.
We should leave.

948
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,337
Now it is below.

949
01:16:58,413 --> 01:16:59,413
Where was it?
Really?

950
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,540
Yes, it is there.

951
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,016
Good, because it should
to be very quiet...

952
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,349
...because I don't listen anybody.

953
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,388
Who devils are you?

954
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,890
Mr., my name is David.
Where were you before?

955
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,324
Did you hide, boy?

956
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:15,192
Yes, did you hide, certain?

957
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,754
Children, I knew from the moment
that they arrived to my city...

958
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,323
...they would cause me problems.

959
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,096
Sheriff, this is
a malentendido.

960
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,534
What is a malentendido...

961
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,663
...it is that they killed Peggy and Jerry
in the restaurant...

962
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,901
...because that understands it
very well, devils.

963
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,408
Not we kill anybody.

964
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,604
The things were calmed
here during 15 years.

965
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:31,679
In 15 years...

966
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:33,112
...anything happened in
this city...

967
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,046
...except several
drunkards' fights.

968
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:36,209
Now you pendejos appears...

969
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:37,774
...and I have two cadavers
in my hands.

970
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,411
- Please, he/she should listen...
- Be quiet!

971
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,116
Not I came to socialize with
you, murderers.

972
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,748
Now, against the wall!

973
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,688
What they are, a couple
of reporters?

974
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:50,129
They write for their pathetic one
university newspaper.

975
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,426
They come here for
to discover the truth...

976
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,592
...on the history
of Ray Williams?

977
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,533
Of what is he/she speaking?

978
01:17:54,603 --> 01:17:55,797
From time to time...

979
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,839
...they come a pendejos couple
inquisitive as you...

980
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,568
...to sniff, to look for tracks.

981
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:01,939
Not there is you step.

982
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,240
Ray Williams is dead.

983
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,745
Of what is he/she speaking?

984
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:07,611
I know of what he/she speaks.

985
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,775
Ray Williams:

986
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,182
Camionera of Maine, black.

987
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,880
He/she stopped in Ellis to drink something...

988
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:14,888
...and a group of local
they hit him/her brutally...

989
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,719
...and they left their body in a field.

990
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:20,159
And here the sheriff Taggart helped
to that absolved them.

991
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:22,253
None of them happened
neither one second in the jail.

992
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,389
Not he/she had why to be in Ellis.

993
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,466
It hid it.

994
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,731
I made my work.

995
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,002
My responsibility is
with people of this city.

996
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:35,737
Also, nobody will miss...

997
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,005
...to a black boy
anyway.

998
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,341
Idiot!

999
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,413
David.

1000
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:41,573
What devils was that?

1001
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,049
Who is up?

1002
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,142
He/she already knows who is.

1003
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,414
Care, heart.
He/she looks at what you say.

1004
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:48,080
Ray Williams is up.

1005
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:49,453
Ray Williams is dead!

1006
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,082
Don't play it!

1007
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,626
I will bury you, boy...

1008
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:55,492
...and the Mr. he/she knows that I am
good burying things.

1009
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,191
Better he/she prays that
your other friend...

1010
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:58,892
...have a good place where
to hide...

1011
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,492
...because when he/she finds it,
I will kill him.

1012
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:06,941
That nobody moves a puto muscle
until he/she returns.

1013
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:09,306
We won't move.

1014
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,004
I know that they won't make it.

1015
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,571
David!

1016
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,418
David.

1017
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,157
Not I can breathe.
David.

1018
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:30,892
God, David. God.

1019
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,866
We will be well.

1020
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:35,494
Mags, hurts me a lot.

1021
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,003
David, we will leave of here.

1022
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,838
I promise it to you.

1023
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:46,540
No, I don't believe.

1024
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,477
No!

1025
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,318
David.

1026
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:05,195
I sit down it a lot.

1027
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,413
Where are you, boy?

1028
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,528
Are you there, son?

1029
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:44,970
To hide you won't help.

1030
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,667
They come here.

1031
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,936
I want to show you that that
I made to your black friend.

1032
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,285
I have them.

1033
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:47,067
No! No!

1034
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:59,439
No! No!

1035
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:03,314
No!
