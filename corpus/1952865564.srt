1
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,852
I need a drink.

2
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:26,083
Here you go.

3
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:31,054
Okay, all right.

4
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,756
Katie Cumming?

5
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:33,957
Shaved.

6
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,363
-Very bad.
-Nice.

7
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,367
What about Molly Simmons?

8
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:39,466
Trimmed neatly.

9
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:41,368
I like it. I like that.

10
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,373
Holly fucking Dwyer?

11
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:45,671
Full bush, with a little treasure trail.

12
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:47,233
Fucking treasure turn pike.

13
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,239
Fucking treasure freeway
with a car pool lane.

14
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,195
-Here we go.
-Yes.

15
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,635
Who invited you freaks?

16
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:24,741
So he walks up to her,
he goes, "Open the vagina."

17
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,875
Come on. I never said that.

18
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,180
No, no wait.

19
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:30,747
She slaps the shit out of him,

20
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:34,584
and so he says,
"Open the vagina, please."

21
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:18,767
Sarah Voizon?

22
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,501
Shaved.

23
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:25,831
Timmerman's sister?

24
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,638
Dude, she's seven.

25
00:02:34,552 --> 00:02:36,577
Timmerman's mom?

26
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,754
Buckwheat in a scissor lock.

27
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,157
Janie Smith?

28
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,333
Trimmed.

29
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,852
You study for that history exam?

30
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:15,381
No.

31
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,098
Dude, that scared the shit out of me.

32
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:48,912
SECONDS APART

33
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,590
I can't see.

34
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,094
I can't see.

35
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,189
Popular kids,
from what we're getting upstairs.

36
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,319
Jocks.

37
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:06,660
Football or basketball?

38
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:07,959
Football.

39
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,630
They had a game tomorrow.

40
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,201
Nobody heard the gun shots?

41
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,972
They had music cranked up pretty good.

42
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,574
-Who found them?
-Pizza guy.

43
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,240
Pizza guy? They ordered pizza?

44
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:22,334
Two.

45
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:25,380
Pizza guy strolled in at 11 :05.

46
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:30,150
So they commit suicide en masse,
the night before the big game

47
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:31,980
and they ordered pizza.

48
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:36,383
-En masse?
-My vocabulary is expanding.

49
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:39,521
Must be the literature.

50
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:44,567
Here's what I think happened.
Junior got a hold of papa's gun,

51
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:48,002
started to have a friendly game
of Russian roulette.

52
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:50,267
Things just got out of hand.

53
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:54,636
First kid commits suicide,
blows his brains out.

54
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:58,011
That'd bring the game to
a screeching halt, don't you think?

55
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,413
Can you feel it?

56
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:11,718
-But all the elements are there.
-Trimmed.

57
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,821
Then why can't we feel it?

58
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,899
The project takes time.

59
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,328
But everyone else feels it.

60
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:25,739
I feel it.

61
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:27,604
-Liar.
-Seriously.

62
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,972
There, the way he tilts his head.

63
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,845
No. It's in his eyes.

64
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,811
Bedtime, boys.

65
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,614
Five more minutes.

66
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,086
You heard your mother.

67
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,555
That scared the shit out of me.

68
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,260
Well, maybe next time.

69
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:35,609
I didn't feel it.

70
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,738
I know.

71
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:40,845
Trial and error,
that's the nature of the project.

72
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,683
It's the genius of the project.

73
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:45,516
Exactly.

74
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,524
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

75
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,290
Now I got to run. Booked all morning.

76
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:55,825
You'll be home in time for dinner?

77
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,650
Word of honor.

78
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:01,058
Do you know how much I love you?

79
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:03,063
This much?

80
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,596
Not even close.

81
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:07,434
This much?

82
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,928
It is with great regret
that I've summoned you here today.

83
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,694
The loss of these four fine young men

84
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,793
has come as an abrupt
and unexpected shock.

85
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:43,563
They were friends, scholars, athletes.

86
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:49,142
But above all, they were the embodiment
of the phrase, "Men for others."

87
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:50,675
Let us pray.

88
00:10:51,282 --> 00:10:54,581
"Our father, who art in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name.

89
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,777
"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done."

90
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:03,149
Detective Lampkin.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

91
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:04,785
Good book?

92
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:08,087
Yes, well, it does have its moments.

93
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,828
Poetics?

94
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,859
You mind if I...

95
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:14,234
Of course, for as long as you like.

96
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:16,900
Please.

97
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:20,743
Well, so far,

98
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:24,513
most of the guests at the party
don't remember a goddamn thing.

99
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,851
I was wondering if I could
open it up a little bit.

100
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,355
Interview some friends,
girlfriends, that sort of thing.

101
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:34,882
They were very popular boys.

102
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,427
I always wondered what that was like.

103
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,028
You heard anything?

104
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:42,489
Just a lot of teenage gossip.

105
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,400
That they were in a suicide club.

106
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:48,436
Some sort of satanic ritual, drugs.

107
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:51,999
Were they on drugs?

108
00:11:52,776 --> 00:11:55,176
One of them tested positive for weed
and that's about it.

109
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,474
Who?

110
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:03,106
Yes, well, I just hope
that you can help us understand

111
00:12:03,112 --> 00:12:04,511
why they would kill themselves.

112
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:06,522
If, in fact, they did kill themselves.

113
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,753
What are you saying? That someone...

114
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,852
Suicide and homicide.

115
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,457
One can be made to resemble the other.

116
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,636
My uncle has diabetes.

117
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:30,770
He never takes care of it, though.
He's always losing toes.

118
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:36,450
-I'm new. What's your excuse?
-Reactive hypoglycemia.

119
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:39,117
-I'm Eve.
-Jonah.

120
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:43,147
Jonah, I'm looking for room 408A.

121
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:46,021
I had no trouble finding 401 through 407.

122
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:47,154
It's in the Dorsey Annex.

123
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,393
And where might that be?

124
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,625
Far from here.

125
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:56,400
You know, you strike me
as a New Testament kind of guy.

126
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:58,964
Are you familiar with The Parable
of the Good Samaritan?

127
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:02,913
Luke 10, verses 30 to 37.

128
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,408
Great.

129
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:08,912
Let's pretend that you are
the Good Samaritan

130
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:11,318
and I'm on the side of the road.

131
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:14,323
Show me a little mercy,
it's my first day.

132
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,264
All right, follow me.

133
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,704
Pencils down.

134
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:40,275
They didn't even ask about
the Great Western Schism.

135
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:43,411
So, should we focus on the next project?

136
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:44,681
Who?

137
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,051
The one who made you late.

138
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:48,182
No.

139
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,386
We should stick to the program.
Lay low for a while and then...

140
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,588
Feed the birds?

141
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,893
Yeah. Feed the birds.

142
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,636
All right, Vargo. Back to class.

143
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,078
Ms. Dunn.

144
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:19,251
Ms. Dunn, I know this must be
real difficult for you.

145
00:14:19,323 --> 00:14:20,347
Lots of people.

146
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,347
Lots of people what?

147
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:25,860
You're gonna ask me the same thing
that you've asked everybody else.

148
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,420
Do I know anybody
who would wanna hurt those boys?

149
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,866
I know lots of people. They're jerks.

150
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:34,466
-Including Derek?
-Especially Derek.

151
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:38,265
How long did you two date?

152
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,368
I saw them kill a dog once.

153
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,446
Derek and his friends?

154
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,908
A chow chow.

155
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:54,184
They look like lions, don't they?

156
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,029
They do that to your arm, too?

157
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:04,061
No, I was in a movie once.

158
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:32,794
They like making movies.

159
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:35,324
Who likes making movies?

160
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:39,996
Were they at the party?

161
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:45,041
Even if they were,
nobody would remember them.

162
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,501
Twins with the camera.
How do you forget something like that?

163
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:15,825
Jonah Trimble?

164
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,025
Seth.

165
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,433
Good enough.
Let's say we talk for a little while?

166
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,340
Is this seat taken?

167
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:36,348
-Gum?
-It's not allowed.

168
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:44,885
That's a keeper.

169
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,997
It's a shame what happened to them boys,
ain't it?

170
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:56,266
Friends of yours?

171
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,069
We don't have any friends.

172
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,501
You know Elvis had a twin?

173
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,608
I didn't.

174
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,714
Brother was stillborn.

175
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:09,118
Elvis was the first,
then came the dead one.

176
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:12,282
You imagine that? Two Elvises.

177
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:15,048
Wow.

178
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,290
What do you want?

179
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,328
So my real name is Kristen,

180
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,831
but if you ever call me that,
I'll have to kill you.

181
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,767
-I'm from Salem.
-Massachusetts?

182
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,701
Oregon. Vancouver before that.

183
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:29,761
British Columbia?

184
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,932
Washington.

185
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:32,799
Before that, Hollywood.

186
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,968
California?

187
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:35,102
Florida.

188
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,681
-My mom relocates a lot.
-For work?

189
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,250
For love.

190
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:46,348
I mean she thinks it's love.

191
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,790
It looks like love on paper,
but it never really works out.

192
00:18:51,094 --> 00:18:53,927
I'm just trying to make sense
of this tragedy.

193
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:57,194
Maybe you should see
one of the grief counselors.

194
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,230
Maybe you should.

195
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,703
I'm not experiencing any grief.

196
00:19:03,473 --> 00:19:04,701
Really?

197
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,711
Not even...

198
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:14,678
What's it called when you
question God and what not?

199
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:17,583
-Existential.
-Right.

200
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,546
Not even that. That a crime?

201
00:19:22,592 --> 00:19:24,184
Not in this state.

202
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,993
Good. So I guess we're through.

203
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:29,622
Now, withholding evidence,

204
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:32,996
that's a crime.

205
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,435
We've known each other
ever since we were eight.

206
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:45,174
She was the only other kid
on my block, besides me,

207
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,840
who knew the words to American Pie.

208
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,544
-Where?
-Kansas City.

209
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:49,778
Missouri?

210
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,644
Kansas.

211
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,163
Now, neighbor lady says

212
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:57,990
she saw twin boys, about your age,
head into the party,

213
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:01,460
with the video camera rolling.

214
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,856
Now what I can't figure out

215
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:08,802
is how come none of the guests
recall you being there.

216
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:12,370
When you're not popular in high school,
you might as well be invisible.

217
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:13,431
So you were there.

218
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,909
Never said I wasn't.

219
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,775
But we left before anything happened.

220
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:20,783
I think we gonna have to let
the video camera speak for itself.

221
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:26,315
I'm sorry but there is no video.

222
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,087
I mean, there would have been,
but my brother, dumbass,

223
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,787
forgot to put the memory card
in the camera.

224
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:35,415
Seems like a real simple mistake for boys

225
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,628
with such high SAT scores, don't it?

226
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,232
I'm gonna have to talk to your parents.

227
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:43,528
They're out of town.

228
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,306
-Where?
-They're in Aspen.

229
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,678
Your brother says Vail.

230
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:51,611
My brother wouldn't say that.

231
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:52,943
Why not?

232
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,117
Because they're in Aspen.

233
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,090
My God.

234
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,666
It is uncanny.

235
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:12,525
How far apart?

236
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,467
Ninety-three seconds.

237
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,734
-You're the older one, I bet, right?
-Younger.

238
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:22,071
Taller by a few inches, though.

239
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:23,777
Shorter by less than one.

240
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:25,644
Shorter by less than one.

241
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,919
What can you tell me
about the video camera?

242
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:34,886
Your brother says that you, dumbass,

243
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:38,888
forgot to load the memory card
in the camera.

244
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,092
There you have it.

245
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,489
Don't get mad at me.

246
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:46,735
-I'm just repeating what he said.
-I'm not mad.

247
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:47,827
No?

248
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:51,806
You're the sensitive one.

249
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:54,032
Gum?

250
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,905
I'm diabetic.

251
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:07,488
Not so funny second time around.

252
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,358
Dumbass?

253
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,799
Cops dig the vernacular.

254
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,697
-Puts them at ease.
-How considerate of you.

255
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:24,435
Come on.
You know what they're trying to do.

256
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:26,704
He was smart to keep us apart.

257
00:22:27,043 --> 00:22:28,772
Just lucky.

258
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:31,507
Lying about the neighbor,
that was kind of clever.

259
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:33,905
Are you worried?

260
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,609
Not at all.

261
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:40,314
We covered our tracks. He's fishing.

262
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,085
Yeah.

263
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,184
But somebody told him something.

264
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:49,095
So let's find out who.

265
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:24,159
What in God's name
are you two doing here?

266
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:26,668
You said you had an open door policy.

267
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,761
It's after 8:00.
How the hell did you get in here?

268
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:30,772
You said if anyone had a problem
they can come to you.

269
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,569
Anytime, 24/7.

270
00:23:33,076 --> 00:23:34,941
Not now. No...

271
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:39,939
-I thought I saw...
-Rats?

272
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:42,416
You're more likely to find those
among the student body.

273
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,145
-What are you talking about?
-Who ratted us out, Frank?

274
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,579
How dare you?

275
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:50,091
In Africa,
they get to be the size of small dogs.

276
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,218
Is that why you left?

277
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:54,195
I'm gonna have you
little bastards expelled, you hear me?

278
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:55,424
Now get out.

279
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,961
Out!

280
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:15,407
You were just hitting your stride
as a missionary.

281
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:18,150
Why'd you leave?

282
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,089
I got...

283
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:23,457
I got sick.

284
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:24,686
With what?

285
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:33,994
-Dracu...
-Dracunculus.

286
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,469
The Guinea worm.

287
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:44,012
I find parasites
much more interesting than rats.

288
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,981
Did you know we spent a whole week
on parasites in biology class?

289
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,248
-The Guinea worm is our favorite.
-By far.

290
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,587
Infection can be caused by drinking
contaminated water.

291
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:56,421
The worm matures in the host's body,
growing up to six feet long.

292
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,787
After about a year,
it migrates towards the surface.

293
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,090
In 90% of the cases...

294
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,824
The worm will emerge
from the leg or the foot.

295
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:09,027
The worm needs to be rolled out
onto a small stick.

296
00:25:09,572 --> 00:25:12,973
Caution must be exercised during removal,

297
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:15,303
Frank.

298
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:24,177
If it breaks...

299
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:27,814
What happens if it breaks?

300
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:28,983
Crippled.

301
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:33,121
Right, you can lose a leg.

302
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,220
Or worse.

303
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:50,569
Now back to my original question, Frank.

304
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:53,774
Who ratted us out?

305
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:57,445
I can't hear you.

306
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,182
Katie.

307
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:02,119
Really?

308
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:06,287
Guess we didn't make
enough of an impression on her.

309
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:07,762
Please, please.

310
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:09,691
No.

311
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:13,335
Looks like you'll have
to dig it out yourself.

312
00:26:13,403 --> 00:26:15,132
Dig out? No!

313
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:19,608
I found this in the contraband drawer.

314
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:55,711
He cut an artery. Bled out in minutes.

315
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,110
You get a shot of this?

316
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:02,482
Maybe he was trying to get to the phone.

317
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,314
Maybe he was trying to tell us
something else.

318
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,460
How you doing, Lampkin?

319
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,092
Larry, I want you to be the first to know,

320
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:20,469
this is my last pack of cigarettes.

321
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:21,834
Yeah, I heard that one before.

322
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:25,238
Oh, man. Seriously, my wife says
she's gonna divorce me if I don't quit.

323
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:29,473
Figure I'm gonna
have two on the ride home,

324
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:32,242
park a block away, have one in the car

325
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:33,805
and two on the porch. Shit, maybe three.

326
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:36,307
How many that make?

327
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:38,648
Fuck 'em all but nine.

328
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,119
-Come again.
-We used to say that back in Nam.

329
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,520
Six for pallbearers.

330
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,493
Two for the road guards.

331
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,259
One to count cadence.

332
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,725
Fuck 'em all but nine.

333
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,565
Fuck 'em all but nine.

334
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,164
Maybel?

335
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:27,594
Maybel!

336
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:52,888
I can't see. I can't see.

337
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,151
That wasn't so bad, was it?

338
00:29:26,696 --> 00:29:30,496
Welcome to pain management
for the new millennium, Detective.

339
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:34,633
Distract the mind from what's happening
to the body.

340
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:40,103
Send you on a little trip,
while we scrub you down.

341
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:40,266
We need to escalate.

342
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:42,167
Haven't we done enough lately?

343
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:45,901
They're just trying to make sense
out of this tragedy.

344
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,441
-We need to talk about Katie.
-No.

345
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:50,536
Morning, Katie.

346
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:51,671
She's a loose end.

347
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:56,014
The quicker we take care of her, the
quicker we can get back to the project.

348
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:57,882
I think we should take a break for a while.

349
00:30:57,954 --> 00:31:00,582
Why? What about feeding the birds?

350
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:02,918
Holy shit.

351
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,296
-I can tell the difference.
-You can?

352
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:17,334
You have a scar by your eye.

353
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:19,432
And you have a squiggly thing on your iris.

354
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:20,498
I do?

355
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,376
It's kind of cool.

356
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,436
I'm Seth.

357
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:27,143
Eve.

358
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,776
Nice to meet you, Eve.

359
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:32,480
You know, Jonah and I have been
working on this little project.

360
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,886
-Seth.
-What kind of project?

361
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,717
It's a movie.

362
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:38,956
-You wanna be in it?
-No.

363
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:40,222
Sure.

364
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,224
I mean, how do we even know she can act?

365
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,699
Audition me.

366
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:48,296
Sounds pretty reasonable to me.

367
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:51,098
Don't we have someone else in mind?

368
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:54,200
Do we?

369
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:56,507
Yes. We do.

370
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,439
-I want her.
-Good, let's have her.

371
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:02,609
No, just me.

372
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:04,516
-All to yourself?
-Yes.

373
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:07,921
-You wouldn't know what to do with her.
-I know what not to do with her.

374
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,151
I've learned from our mistakes.

375
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:28,940
Katie.

376
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:47,719
Katie.

377
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:53,896
Daddy?

378
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,232
Yes, Katie, it's me.

379
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,106
How's my little angel?

380
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:03,806
Daddy, I miss you so much.

381
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,607
I miss you, too.

382
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:08,479
How's my little girl?

383
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:16,155
It's okay.

384
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,085
I know about the abortion.

385
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:24,298
How you can't have children.

386
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:35,240
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

387
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:39,304
Sweetheart, do you know where I am?

388
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:47,483
Heaven.

389
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,853
Would you like to be with me?

390
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,755
Yes, I would.

391
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,726
I wanna see you.

392
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:04,439
Daddy?

393
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:07,739
Daddy?

394
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:11,279
Daddy?

395
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:33,993
Katie?

396
00:34:41,077 --> 00:34:42,704
Stay the fuck away from me.

397
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:44,404
Put the glass down.

398
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:13,501
No!

399
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:22,511
-Another suicide.
-And you believe that?

400
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,746
This time, we got a bunch of witnesses.

401
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,946
Including our boys?

402
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:29,480
Trimble, Jonah and Seth,
they were sitting right there.

403
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:33,585
What makes you think they're witnesses?

404
00:35:34,096 --> 00:35:35,120
What's your point?

405
00:35:35,598 --> 00:35:37,293
My point is maybe
they had something to do with it.

406
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,258
Well, your point is moot.

407
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,996
Moot?

408
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:43,971
I'm expanding my vocabulary.

409
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:46,634
Books?

410
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,707
Books on tape.

411
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:54,315
Look, Detective, I got 15 witnesses says
those boys never laid a finger on her.

412
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,077
Maybe they didn't have to.

413
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:47,158
She's as same as the others.

414
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:48,999
No. She's better.

415
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:53,340
I feel it.

416
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:54,808
Liar.

417
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:02,181
Maybe it's your blood sugar.
I'll make you a sandwich.

418
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,680
I'm not hungry.

419
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:32,705
Where's Jonah?

420
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:35,509
I don't know.

421
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:38,513
Not your brother's keeper, huh?

422
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,021
You know the game Hacky Sack?

423
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,862
Me and my buddies
used to play it in college.

424
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:54,765
I remember this one time we were
playing and this feeling came over me.

425
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,267
Sadness.

426
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,102
Found out my father died that day.

427
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,041
While you were playing Hacky Sack?

428
00:38:11,487 --> 00:38:15,287
I've been reading up
the last couple of nights about twins.

429
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:21,554
And a lot of people say
that twins have a special connection.

430
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:26,400
Started to think you and your brother
have a special connection.

431
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,734
Like you and your wife?

432
00:38:35,177 --> 00:38:36,166
My wife?

433
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:40,313
What were you doing when she died?
Playing canasta?

434
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:57,689
Don't talk about my wife.

435
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:03,404
Were you freaked out?

436
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:05,133
Not really.

437
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:07,198
What about the blood?

438
00:39:07,276 --> 00:39:09,471
There wasn't that much blood.

439
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:13,713
You know what I mean.
Someone offs themselves in front of you,

440
00:39:13,782 --> 00:39:15,682
there's an effect, right?

441
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:16,979
There's supposed to be.

442
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:22,420
I've been to five schools in three years
and I can honestly say,

443
00:39:22,491 --> 00:39:23,788
I've never met anyone like you.

444
00:39:27,263 --> 00:39:28,252
Really?

445
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:31,322
Well, well, well.

446
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:34,362
I need to borrow
your boyfriend for a minute.

447
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:36,328
I'm not her boyfriend.

448
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:40,169
She didn't seem to mind the label much.

449
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:43,644
Seth, on the other hand,
did not look happy

450
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,940
because he felt left out.

451
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:51,314
God with the football team this year?

452
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:55,449
God was always with our football team.

453
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:59,083
Not so much the water polo team.

454
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:05,792
I was never much into sports myself.

455
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,565
Too much like you.

456
00:40:10,506 --> 00:40:11,666
Too damn sensitive.

457
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,674
Your interrogation technique sucks.

458
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,006
See that's not you talking. That's Seth.

459
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:17,511
Seth must have really gotten to you.

460
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:21,374
He said some hurtful things about my wife.

461
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,848
I lost control.

462
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:29,885
Hell, I think any man would.

463
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,052
I think you would have stood up
for somebody that you care about.

464
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:40,459
She met your parents yet?

465
00:40:40,536 --> 00:40:41,798
No.

466
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,566
Think it's about time I did.

467
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:11,456
May I help you?

468
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:13,595
Excuse me. I...

469
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:19,399
I knocked loud, twice,
and no one came to the door.

470
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:20,601
I'm Detective Lampkin.

471
00:41:20,676 --> 00:41:24,237
Detective Lampkin.
Our sons told us about you.

472
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,105
I'm sure they did.

473
00:41:29,785 --> 00:41:31,275
Nice home.

474
00:41:31,353 --> 00:41:33,844
You know, my mama, she used to...

475
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:37,357
She used to work as a housekeeper
in a beautiful home.

476
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:38,959
Like this.

477
00:41:40,296 --> 00:41:41,456
How long you've been living here?

478
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:44,365
This house has been in my family
for many years.

479
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:45,593
You mind if I...

480
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:46,828
No.

481
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:53,966
You know, I couldn't afford this place
with my salary and my pension.

482
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,236
What kind of square footage
are you looking at?

483
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,872
About 4,000.

484
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:04,214
You know, my house right here,
I'm standing in my kitchenette,

485
00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:08,313
and I take two steps, little steps,
I'm in the alley way.

486
00:42:09,658 --> 00:42:12,786
Sounds claustrophobic.

487
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:17,996
Like a jail cell.

488
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:23,036
-Where are your boys?
-Upstairs.

489
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:28,772
I am sure that they have informed you
about the recent tragedies.

490
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:30,437
We're still in shock.

491
00:42:31,146 --> 00:42:35,048
I'm advising all the parents
to communicate with their children.

492
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:36,784
Help us sort out this mess.

493
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:40,180
We did and we have.

494
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:44,514
We have great communication
with our boys.

495
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:46,521
They mention the video?

496
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:50,830
Unfortunately there is no video,
Detective Lampkin.

497
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:54,268
I wish there had been.

498
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:58,471
Perhaps it could have helped you
make sense of things.

499
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,900
They ever talked to you about their gift?

500
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,376
I should hope they have more than one gift.

501
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:06,880
Gift I'm referring to is

502
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:09,414
less conventional.

503
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,811
I'm not sure I'm following you.

504
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,784
How was Aspen?

505
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:21,557
I don't see what this has to do with it.

506
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:28,197
We stayed at a little bed and breakfast.

507
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,594
Which one?

508
00:43:31,206 --> 00:43:32,901
I'm sure you've never heard of it.

509
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,634
Try me.

510
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,609
Elsa's Landing.

511
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,675
Honeymoon suite.

512
00:43:46,722 --> 00:43:48,349
Do you know it?

513
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:53,523
We even brought back a little souvenir.

514
00:43:54,163 --> 00:43:55,187
Right over there.

515
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:12,770
My wife and I used to go there.

516
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:13,872
It's lovely, isn't it?

517
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,650
Yeah.

518
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,118
Anything else, Detective?

519
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:24,851
No.

520
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,898
Thank you for your time.

521
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:32,126
Ma'am.

522
00:44:35,037 --> 00:44:36,937
Oh, and Detective.

523
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,807
You lay a hand on one of my boys again

524
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:45,370
and you can kiss that little pension
of yours goodbye, understood?

525
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:49,575
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,316
You're on work study?

527
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:34,653
I just needed to get away.

528
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,062
The police asked me about you.

529
00:45:37,132 --> 00:45:38,463
I know.

530
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:44,235
Should I be worried?

531
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:45,599
Maybe.

532
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:53,046
Do you play?

533
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:54,173
No.

534
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:58,478
Here.

535
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:06,489
That's good.

536
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:20,007
-Good job.
-Yeah?

537
00:46:24,546 --> 00:46:26,070
So where do you live?

538
00:46:26,615 --> 00:46:28,981
Santa Maria, by Dunham.

539
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:30,643
Fancy.

540
00:46:33,855 --> 00:46:35,015
Do you want to hang out there?

541
00:46:37,492 --> 00:46:40,052
I'm not allowed to have guests over.

542
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:42,129
Then we'll go to my house.

543
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:49,767
I can't see.

544
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:52,097
I can't see.

545
00:49:08,009 --> 00:49:10,170
Excuse me, so sorry to bother you.

546
00:49:10,645 --> 00:49:12,909
-Can you help us out?
-We are kind of stranded here.

547
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:20,084
I...

548
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:22,781
I just parked my wheels right over there.

549
00:49:36,538 --> 00:49:38,904
Thought I was seeing double
back there for a second.

550
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:42,101
I guess you guys get that a lot, huh?
Twin jokes?

551
00:49:42,577 --> 00:49:43,669
Less than you think.

552
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,872
So, Kirby, do you?

553
00:49:48,517 --> 00:49:51,611
-What?
-You know, feed the birds.

554
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,519
Did I say my name was Kirby?

555
00:50:00,162 --> 00:50:02,130
This isn't the way to Grandma's house.

556
00:50:02,197 --> 00:50:03,892
Yeah, we blew past that
like three miles ago.

557
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:05,455
Don't worry.

558
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:08,626
I know a way.

559
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:17,510
You ever hold a little bird in your hand?

560
00:50:19,247 --> 00:50:21,010
It's so light.

561
00:50:23,151 --> 00:50:25,278
Deceptively light.

562
00:50:25,987 --> 00:50:28,512
It's an aerodynamic thing, I guess.

563
00:50:32,093 --> 00:50:34,459
Well, boys at your age

564
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:38,823
are like little birds.

565
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,392
I guess you realize I do
at the carnival, but you pick one up...

566
00:51:08,196 --> 00:51:09,458
Mother?

567
00:51:10,665 --> 00:51:11,859
Mother?

568
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:16,662
It's okay.

569
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:20,930
Mother.

570
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:23,469
Kirby, help.

571
00:51:25,513 --> 00:51:26,673
Mommy.

572
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:29,310
Mom!

573
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:30,612
Here it comes.

574
00:51:32,854 --> 00:51:34,185
Hey!

575
00:51:34,456 --> 00:51:35,514
Hey!

576
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:44,395
-Why did you get in the car?
-We needed a ride.

577
00:51:44,466 --> 00:51:46,900
-You needed a ride where?
-The mall.

578
00:51:46,968 --> 00:51:48,993
We told him to stop
but he just kept going.

579
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,197
Jonah grabbed the wheel
and the car started swerving.

580
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:52,535
Then I pulled the emergency brake.

581
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:54,837
And the rest is on video. Why?

582
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:56,843
Evidence.

583
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:59,237
Figured we could show it to the police
when we got away.

584
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:01,305
We didn't see the truck coming
until it was too late.

585
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,715
The driver says,
he's been taking that same route

586
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:06,686
every Saturday morning
for the last five years.

587
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:08,882
Company log says he ain't lying.

588
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:10,951
Neither are we.

589
00:52:11,026 --> 00:52:12,653
I think you knew that truck was coming.

590
00:52:12,727 --> 00:52:14,854
I think you tricked that man
into giving you a ride.

591
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,091
And I think you used
your unique talents to kill him.

592
00:52:17,966 --> 00:52:21,231
Right, you think we have
these weird powers.

593
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,602
You know, my dad
called his lawyer last night.

594
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:27,972
Not because you hit me.
It's no big deal.

595
00:52:28,043 --> 00:52:29,533
You were upset.

596
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:33,511
It was just to see what our rights are.

597
00:52:35,216 --> 00:52:37,650
He says what you're doing is harassment.

598
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,584
This is not Salem.

599
00:52:40,155 --> 00:52:41,452
It's what he said.

600
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,221
Wormwood wants you.

601
00:52:47,195 --> 00:52:48,184
What the hell are you doing in there?

602
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,956
Interviewing suspects.

603
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:53,629
We have our suspect, right here.
Kirby LeFleur.

604
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:56,602
Busted in '91 for indecent exposure.

605
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:59,674
Graduated to criminal misconduct
with a minor in '94.

606
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:02,209
Did a seven-year stretch
for accosting a child.

607
00:53:02,577 --> 00:53:05,273
As far as I'm concerned, those kids
were abducted by a sexual predator

608
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:07,611
who should have invested
in a AAA membership.

609
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:09,081
That's what they want you to think.

610
00:53:10,352 --> 00:53:14,550
They can get inside of people's heads.
I've seen them.

611
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:17,854
Did I bring you back too soon?

612
00:53:19,294 --> 00:53:21,159
Let them go, Detective.

613
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:23,187
This isn't Salem.

614
00:53:27,902 --> 00:53:30,462
This time he deserved it.
He's a goddamn pedophile.

615
00:53:30,538 --> 00:53:33,871
Then why didn't it make a difference?
Why didn't we feel a fucking thing?

616
00:53:33,942 --> 00:53:36,570
It's the nature of the project,
all right? Trial and error.

617
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:37,668
It's the genius of the project.

618
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:39,509
It's just not working.

619
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,981
Come on.
You know we have it in us, all right.

620
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,678
Remember when we were little
before the babysitter?

621
00:53:44,753 --> 00:53:46,846
-I think that part of us is broken.
-Why?

622
00:53:48,056 --> 00:53:49,956
I'm done wasting my time.

623
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:51,014
It's her, isn't it?

624
00:53:53,595 --> 00:53:54,584
No.

625
00:53:55,196 --> 00:53:56,663
You can't abandon the project.

626
00:53:57,999 --> 00:53:59,626
I just did.

627
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:06,503
He just doesn't get it. I can't do this.

628
00:54:06,574 --> 00:54:08,633
-Do what?
-The project.

629
00:54:09,044 --> 00:54:11,137
We're not the same anymore.

630
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:13,538
-I'm not making any sense.
-No, it's okay.

631
00:54:15,283 --> 00:54:16,875
You're just upset.

632
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:20,844
I'm glad you called me.

633
00:55:00,895 --> 00:55:02,658
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

634
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,196
Who's your friend?

635
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:05,289
Jonah Trimble.

636
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:07,300
Hi, Jonah Trimble. I'm Brenda.

637
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:08,357
Nice to meet you.

638
00:55:18,513 --> 00:55:20,174
-Thank you.
-Okay, Mom.

639
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:28,253
All right, honey, I'm gonna go lay down.

640
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,248
I'm sorry about my mom.

641
00:55:30,325 --> 00:55:32,384
She's much more interesting
when she's sober.

642
00:55:32,927 --> 00:55:34,121
I liked her.

643
00:55:34,229 --> 00:55:36,595
-Not too much, I hope.
-No.

644
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:40,293
I bet you have the perfect parents.

645
00:55:40,368 --> 00:55:43,303
I used to think so as a kid.

646
00:55:45,073 --> 00:55:47,007
What does your dad do?

647
00:55:47,342 --> 00:55:49,037
He was a doctor.

648
00:55:49,377 --> 00:55:51,140
What does he do now?

649
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:52,679
He's a doctor.

650
00:55:57,252 --> 00:55:59,015
You said "was."

651
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:02,049
-I wasn't. I was just...
-I don't wear thongs.

652
00:56:02,123 --> 00:56:05,820
I mean, I know most girls do
but I don't like the way they feel.

653
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:08,022
Do you know, one time,
a boy broke up with me

654
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:10,997
just because I didn't wear one.
Can you believe that?

655
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,061
I bet you wear boxers.

656
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:18,930
Ask me another question.

657
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,208
-I didn't ask you anything.
-On a boat.

658
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,001
-What?
-My first time was on a boat.

659
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:25,670
On the Lake of Ozarks.
You know where that is?

660
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:28,340
Ask me another question.

661
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,151
-I can't think of any.
-Some football player, some jerk.

662
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:34,310
What was it like?

663
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,151
It hurt.

664
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:38,522
Here.

665
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:43,123
That's what I like to listen to.

666
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:45,325
-How old were you?
-Fourteen.

667
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:49,196
Listen.

668
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:58,470
It's beautiful.

669
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:35,609
-What's wrong?
-I should go home.

670
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:39,783
-You're not into me?
-No. I am.

671
00:57:40,555 --> 00:57:42,284
-It's just I...
-Wanna take things slow?

672
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:44,081
Yeah.

673
00:57:46,227 --> 00:57:47,285
You're weird.

674
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:48,884
I know.

675
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:54,092
I'll see you later?

676
00:57:55,603 --> 00:57:56,695
Here.

677
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:02,409
So I can tell you apart.

678
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:32,402
I know you feel it with her.

679
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,633
Of course not.

680
00:58:36,744 --> 00:58:39,713
It's why you don't need
the project anymore.

681
00:58:44,452 --> 00:58:46,215
I need some protein.

682
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:52,419
Maybe I should go see her.

683
00:58:53,428 --> 00:58:54,622
Stay away from her.

684
00:58:57,265 --> 00:58:58,289
Nice ring.

685
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:01,567
What's going on up there?

686
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,232
Nothing.

687
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:12,735
Hold me.

688
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:17,617
I can't see.

689
01:00:04,031 --> 01:00:06,693
Linda, I need to go back there.

690
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:10,069
I don't see any fresh burns
on you, Detective.

691
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:12,038
Anyway, we're done for today.

692
01:00:12,106 --> 01:00:14,870
Please, I just need to escape.

693
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:27,410
I'm sorry it's just...

694
01:01:28,716 --> 01:01:31,048
My wife and I used to go here.

695
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:34,682
Yeah.

696
01:02:35,683 --> 01:02:38,243
-Happy birthday, Jonah.
-Happy birthday, you two!

697
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,879
Happy birthday, my two sweet boys.

698
01:02:45,593 --> 01:02:47,584
That's the way, boys. Good job.

699
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:00,536
It's about a girl, isn't it?

700
01:03:01,909 --> 01:03:04,810
At your age, it's always about a girl.

701
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:07,880
Or God.

702
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:11,508
I don't believe in God.

703
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:16,748
You were always my favorite.

704
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:19,687
Really?

705
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,224
Is she beautiful?

706
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:26,123
Yeah.

707
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:29,164
I used to be beautiful, too.

708
01:03:29,937 --> 01:03:31,165
You still are.

709
01:03:32,773 --> 01:03:35,333
You're the most beautiful mother
in the entire world.

710
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:40,038
Having twins,

711
01:03:41,816 --> 01:03:43,215
it ruined me.

712
01:03:53,961 --> 01:03:55,690
See the stretch marks?

713
01:03:56,263 --> 01:03:57,287
I'm sorry.

714
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:00,324
Touch it.

715
01:04:03,137 --> 01:04:04,729
It's okay.

716
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:13,810
You sucked the life out of me.

717
01:04:16,017 --> 01:04:18,110
Look, the babysitter.

718
01:04:20,187 --> 01:04:22,246
She's so beautiful.

719
01:04:24,258 --> 01:04:26,726
Remember the babysitter?

720
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,177
Things really seem to be falling apart.

721
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:50,680
Yes.

722
01:04:51,652 --> 01:04:53,176
It's strange.

723
01:04:58,492 --> 01:05:00,357
Time for your shot.

724
01:05:44,538 --> 01:05:45,800
Dr. Elder?

725
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:48,808
Dr. Elder is dead.

726
01:05:48,876 --> 01:05:51,777
-I'm Detective Lampkin.
-I'm Dr. Houska.

727
01:05:52,379 --> 01:05:53,744
We used to be partners.

728
01:05:55,649 --> 01:05:58,277
Well, they came here to get pregnant.

729
01:06:02,556 --> 01:06:04,387
That's what we do.

730
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:07,558
Or it's what we did.

731
01:06:08,162 --> 01:06:10,323
How does that work? Drug?

732
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:14,025
Well, it depends on the patient.
Depends on the couple.

733
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:15,858
I'm asking about the Trimbles.

734
01:06:15,936 --> 01:06:19,201
Can I see your credentials again,
please, Detective?

735
01:06:21,776 --> 01:06:23,869
-About that time, isn't it?
-Excuse me?

736
01:06:23,944 --> 01:06:26,412
I don't mean to compare you
with the local street addict

737
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,744
but a jones is a jones, ain't it though?

738
01:06:28,816 --> 01:06:32,513
Listen, I have a consultation I have to make.

739
01:06:32,586 --> 01:06:35,987
So please. Hey! Hey! Get your hands...

740
01:06:39,026 --> 01:06:43,486
I'm not asking you to compromise
your high ethical standards.

741
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,296
Just allow me to compromise mine, okay?

742
01:06:52,673 --> 01:06:55,574
All right, Detective,
you're on your own.

743
01:08:13,587 --> 01:08:15,111
What happened?

744
01:08:16,023 --> 01:08:20,119
You went to instant shock
because you've been eating like shit.

745
01:08:27,001 --> 01:08:29,196
Come on, time for school.

746
01:08:52,493 --> 01:08:53,653
Sorry about last night.

747
01:08:55,195 --> 01:08:56,253
Catholic guilt?

748
01:08:56,697 --> 01:08:57,994
I fell asleep.

749
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:01,762
Me, too. I was out like a light.
Why did you leave again?

750
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,864
-What?
-You could have stayed the night.

751
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:07,066
My mom's cool.

752
01:09:14,348 --> 01:09:15,372
What's wrong?

753
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,609
I never do that.

754
01:09:20,554 --> 01:09:23,546
I mean,
I try to get to know the guy first.

755
01:09:25,506 --> 01:09:27,663
Listen,
if some of the stuff that I said...

756
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:29,687
I hope I didn't scare you away.

757
01:09:30,631 --> 01:09:34,123
I haven't been scared since I was little.

758
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:44,306
-I take it you're pissed.
-Fuck you! Why?

759
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:46,412
To keep you in your place.

760
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:49,046
Shut up!

761
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:53,116
We're the same!

762
01:09:56,857 --> 01:09:58,017
Jonah!

763
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:06,232
Couldn't tell the difference,
you fucking idiot!

764
01:11:17,771 --> 01:11:20,103
Well, I'll be damned.

765
01:11:33,253 --> 01:11:37,212
...color of television and radio
as well as stereo recording.

766
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:40,783
This fabulous home entertainment center
will be yours

767
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:43,193
if The Price Is Right, priced authority.

768
01:11:43,263 --> 01:11:44,924
Thank you, Don. And thank you, ladies.

769
01:11:44,998 --> 01:11:49,059
Mr. Ritner, we begin with you.
Minimum is 50. You may start anywhere.

770
01:11:53,006 --> 01:11:54,803
Oh, my God.

771
01:12:10,991 --> 01:12:13,551
Did Seth do that?

772
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:15,993
No. I did it.

773
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,657
Owen.

774
01:12:19,299 --> 01:12:20,630
Does it hurt?

775
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:22,726
Now they'll be able to tell us apart.

776
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:25,237
...Fifty, that's the minimum. $1500.

777
01:12:25,305 --> 01:12:27,239
Mr. Ritner,
you're picking up where you left off.

778
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:30,275
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

779
01:12:31,345 --> 01:12:32,539
I'm your favorite right?

780
01:12:32,646 --> 01:12:36,173
Sweetie, I love you both just the same.

781
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,810
No. No.

782
01:12:40,888 --> 01:12:42,753
You said I was your favorite.

783
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:44,051
Did I?

784
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:46,519
I can't remember.

785
01:12:46,593 --> 01:12:49,494
He says we're just the same,
but I'm not like him, right?

786
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:52,088
We're all special in God's eyes.

787
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:55,468
I've got the scar. I've got the scar.

788
01:12:55,536 --> 01:12:57,936
Sweetie, it's just a tiny little scar.

789
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:00,770
He fucked my girl!

790
01:13:04,011 --> 01:13:05,239
Poor thing.

791
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,247
His heart's broken.

792
01:13:08,515 --> 01:13:09,982
Son.

793
01:13:12,019 --> 01:13:13,748
It'll all come out in the wash.

794
01:13:17,257 --> 01:13:19,555
What kind of parents are you?

795
01:13:19,626 --> 01:13:20,615
Good question.

796
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:26,325
It's okay, Jonah.

797
01:13:28,135 --> 01:13:29,864
It's gonna be okay.

798
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:32,227
You're not like him.

799
01:13:33,006 --> 01:13:35,372
Mommy. Make him leave.

800
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,335
Mommy's not too talkative right now.

801
01:13:40,747 --> 01:13:43,181
Especially when Seth's not around.

802
01:13:44,651 --> 01:13:45,640
Where is he?

803
01:13:45,986 --> 01:13:47,044
I don't know.

804
01:13:47,554 --> 01:13:50,148
It's harder to do when he's not around,
isn't it?

805
01:13:50,724 --> 01:13:51,713
Get out.

806
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:54,226
It's harder to pull the wool
over your own eyes.

807
01:13:54,294 --> 01:13:55,852
Daddy?

808
01:13:56,897 --> 01:13:58,421
Make him leave.

809
01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:00,132
I see what's happening.

810
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:06,332
You know what's happening, Jonah?

811
01:14:10,611 --> 01:14:12,602
I remember now.

812
01:14:14,514 --> 01:14:16,072
It started with the babysitter.

813
01:14:48,715 --> 01:14:51,741
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

814
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:45,163
What is this?

815
01:15:47,274 --> 01:15:48,764
I did this to protect us.

816
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:15,765
Excuse me.

817
01:16:16,903 --> 01:16:21,567
I had knocked loud twice,
but no one answered so...

818
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:26,175
I'm Detective Lampkin.

819
01:16:27,848 --> 01:16:29,179
Nice home.

820
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:32,974
You killed them?

821
01:16:37,824 --> 01:16:39,314
No.

822
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:52,233
I'm sorry.

823
01:17:01,982 --> 01:17:03,176
Listen.

824
01:17:05,419 --> 01:17:07,250
They're ruling this as suicide.

825
01:17:08,155 --> 01:17:09,918
We know differently.

826
01:17:10,824 --> 01:17:12,451
They killed her.

827
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:15,957
We just need to keep them apart.

828
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:21,296
It's just the house.

829
01:17:25,005 --> 01:17:26,768
I'm scared of them.

830
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,303
They wouldn't hurt us.

831
01:17:30,811 --> 01:17:32,904
Then why are we whispering?

832
01:17:42,522 --> 01:17:45,958
Do you remember
how badly we wanted a child?

833
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,252
How we prayed?

834
01:17:48,328 --> 01:17:49,989
I went to those doctors...

835
01:17:50,063 --> 01:17:51,462
It's not our fault.

836
01:17:51,531 --> 01:17:53,294
It's my fault.

837
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:55,630
I let them put those drugs in me.

838
01:17:56,937 --> 01:18:01,397
We just need to keep them apart.

839
01:18:15,422 --> 01:18:17,481
Do you know how much I love you?

840
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:24,095
This much?

841
01:18:26,867 --> 01:18:28,391
Not even close.

842
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:32,669
This much?

843
01:18:34,774 --> 01:18:35,763
This much?

844
01:19:03,203 --> 01:19:07,162
I can make things right, now. Trust me.
I can protect us.

845
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,105
Like the way I always have.

846
01:19:09,843 --> 01:19:13,745
No. It needs to end. Right now.

847
01:19:18,919 --> 01:19:20,386
I don't need you anymore.

848
01:19:25,825 --> 01:19:27,725
What are you doing?

849
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:34,659
Stop!

850
01:19:37,237 --> 01:19:38,568
Stop!

851
01:19:52,185 --> 01:19:53,311
Stop it!

852
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:58,653
You fucking need me.

853
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:00,489
You need me.

854
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:02,386
Get away from him.

855
01:20:04,631 --> 01:20:06,155
Wow.

856
01:20:06,232 --> 01:20:08,097
Where was that enthusiasm last night?

857
01:20:08,168 --> 01:20:11,331
'Cause I thought I was fucking a glass
of water but, hey, I'm willing...

858
01:20:16,676 --> 01:20:18,974
-Please get up.
-Seth.

859
01:20:19,045 --> 01:20:20,137
Get up.

860
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:26,482
Stay away!

861
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:47,739
This is your fault! You fucking whore.

862
01:20:58,084 --> 01:21:00,177
I'm gonna make you watch.

863
01:21:23,977 --> 01:21:25,501
Help!

864
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,747
Help!

865
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:11,388
I can't see.

866
01:23:41,881 --> 01:23:43,473
Can you feel it?

867
01:23:45,185 --> 01:23:46,584
Yeah.

868
01:23:49,823 --> 01:23:51,051
Finally.

869
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:57,722
It's beautiful.

870
01:24:02,535 --> 01:24:03,900
I'm scared.

871
01:24:06,372 --> 01:24:08,067
Me, too.
