Okay, I Didn't
Tell You About Dill

93
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,100
Because-- Because
I Wanted You To Grow, Man,

94
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:08,336
Experience New Things.

95
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,470
I Mean, Just
Building The Courage

97
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,177
Major Guts, Man.

98
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,745
I'm Really Proud Of You.

99
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:21,415

- I Appreciate That--
- (Cackling) Nah, Dude.

101
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:25,486

What's Wrong, Son?
Look A Little Down.

00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:20,574
Yeah. Just Got
Some Things Going On.

108
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,711
Woman Trouble?

109
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:26,247
Well, Yeah.

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,282
I Kinda Missed My Chance
With A Girl I Like.

111
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:30,451
Got Beat To The Punch, Huh?

112
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,388
By The Captain
Of The Basketball Team.

113
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:38,158
Thing Is, Pete,
If You Want To Get Noticed By Girls,

114
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:40,795
You Gotta Give Them
Something To Notice.

115
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:44,265
Like When You Were A Kid,
You Were Into Gymnastics.

116
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,833
<I>That Got You Noticed.

117
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,168
Yeah, Everyone
Thought I Was Weird.

118
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,804
Okay, Bad Example.

119
00:06:50,838 --> 00:06:53,307
But, See, My Point Is,
This Guy Plays Basketball.

120
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,176
That Gets Noticed.

121
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,312
Your Mother Didn't
Even Know I Existed

122
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,214
Until I Did
Something Bold.

123
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,449
I Got A Motorcycle.

124
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,150
And Pulling Out Of
The Dealership,

125
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:05,118
He Rode Off The Sidewalk
And Fell Over.

126
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,719
I Have Poor Balance.

127
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,755
(Snickers)
Your Father Broke

128
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:11,558
Nearly Every
Bone In His Body.

129
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:15,161
- Shake A Tailfeather, We Got 45 Minutes To Tip-Off.
- Come On, Pete.

130
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:18,331
- I'm Not Going To The Game.
- What Did Your Son Just Say?

131
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,434
Why Bother?
Brewster Hasn't Won A Game

132
00:07:20,466 --> 00:07:23,803
Since Like
Early Last Season.

133
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:26,439
- Pete, If This Is Some Sort Of Teenage Acting Out
- <I>(Door Opens, Bell Jingles)

134
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:28,242
Against Your Parents,
We Kindly Ask You

135
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:30,878
- To Leave Rooster Nation Out Of It.
- Yes.

136
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,180
- Hello, Cleatus.

137
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:36,316
(Sneezes)
Oh.

138
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,617
<I>Sounds Like
You Got A Cold.

139
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:40,521
It's Allergies,
But That's A Strong Guess.

140
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:42,423
Doris...

141
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:44,825
(Whispers)
What's Up?

142
00:07:44,857 --> 00:07:46,427
Our Names Haven't
Changed, Cleatus.

143
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,262
We're Still
Mr. And Mrs. Ivey To You.

144
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,331
- That's Right.
- Hey, Wait A Minute, Shouldn't You Be

145
00:07:50,364 --> 00:07:51,631
Heading To The Game By Now?

146
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:54,301
Yes. Yes, I Should.

147
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,338
Well, Come On, Roosters,
Let's Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

148
00:07:58,372 --> 00:07:59,773
(Squawking)

149
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,774
We'll Do That.
That's Where We're Going.

150
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,911
- Poole, What's Up?
- Dude, I Need You To Do Me A Solid.

151
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,079
- Okay.
- <I>(Door Closes, Bell Jingles)

152
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,281
Yeah, I'm Gonna Need You
To Go Ahead And Be The Chicken

153
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,651
Tonight At The Game.
And I Need To Borrow Like 500 Bucks.

154
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,553
What?! No!

155
00:08:12,586 --> 00:08:15,256
I Thought You Said That
You Were My Best Friend.

156
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,458
<I>Okay, No Worries
About The Money

157
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:21,795
And No Hard Feelings
About Filling In For Me Today.

158
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:25,332
I'm Not Gonna Be The Chicken!
What Is Going On?

159
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:28,235
Pete, This Isn't Easy
For Me To Admit.

160
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:30,203
<I>Okay?

161
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:32,238
Okay...

162
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,807
I'm Dying.

163
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,178
(Snickers)

164
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,650
- You're Not Serious.
- Yes, Pete, I'm Serious.

165
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:44,451
I'm Dying Inside
Of This Foam Chicken Head.

166
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,853
- Idiot.
- Dude, It's My Allergies, Man.

167
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,622
Okay, They've
Never Been This Bad.

168
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,558
<I>I Mean, Principal Daly
Got A New Chicken Head

169
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,393

(Sneezes)

171
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:56,764
He Thought
The Bright New Colors

172
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,800
- Would Boost School Spirit, And It's A Fine Plan, Right?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,304
I Mean, I'm Probably Gonna Be The First
Person In History To Sneeze To Death.

174
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,675
Then Quit.
You Hate Being The Chicken.

175
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,709
Pete, You Know
I Can't Do That.

176
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:13,213
Okay, It's My
Family Legacy.

177
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:16,250
- Don't Go For The Wallet--
- Yes, I'm Going For The Wallet, Pete.

178
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:17,817
- I've Seen This--
- <I>Pete, You Made Me Do It.

179
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,325
Me.

180
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,327
My Dad.

181
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:31,365
My Uncle.

182
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:32,899
My Other Uncle

183
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:36,570
I Think That's My Aunt.

184
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,206
My Granddad.

185
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,944
Pete, You're Gonna Have
To Do This For The Grandkids.

186
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,612
I Don't Even Know What Makes
You Think I Can Be The Chicken.

187
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:48,281
I Practically Blacked Out
Saying Hi To Your Sister.

188
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:49,949
Okay, Pete, You Know What?
That's A Sound Argument.

189
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:51,651
I Really Don't
Want To Get Into It.

190
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:54,554
Maybe I Came
And Asked The Wrong Guy.

191
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,357
- <I>(Bell Jingles)
- Okay, Pete, If You Don't Want To Do It,

192
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,292
I Guess I'll Just
Go Talk To Keith Burke.

193
00:09:58,324 --> 00:09:59,993
You Know He Said
He Would Pay Me

194
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,628
To Let Him Wear
The Chicken Suit.

195
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:03,296
I Mean, The Guy Knows
It's A Chick Magnet.

196
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,734
- Wait. Wait A Second.
- No, Pete, That's Too Bad.

197
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:10,271
I Was Even Gonna Offer To Put In
A Good Word To Camie For You.

198
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:12,939
You Know,
Her And Dill Are Barely Hanging On By A Thread.

199
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:14,474
- Are You Serious?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:17,277
And I Know Little Sis
Listens To Big Bro.

201
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,012
I Mean, Come On, Pete.

202
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,583
I Was Gonna Say A Few Choice Words On Your Behalf.

203
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,785
Just Think About That.

204
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:27,353
"Pete 'N' Camie."

205
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:29,055
That's Catchy.

206
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,657
Now It's Gonna Be

207
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,326
"The Burkemeister
'N' Camie."

208
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,862
It's Tragic.

209
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:38,299
Poole, I Don't Even--
I Don't Know The Routine.

210
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,766
Pete, Here's
The Routine--

211
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,934
Ya Walk Around,
Ya Flap Your Wings.

212
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:43,002
Make Sure You Get In All
The School Yearbook Pictures.

213
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,571
Dude, I Don't Know.
I'm An Awful Mascot.

214
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,640
Man.

215
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:50,077
Listen, I Heard
At Mascot Camp

216
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:51,444
They Make
A Hypoallergenic Head

217
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:53,012
<I>For Like 1,000 Bucks.

218
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:54,580
Dude, I'll Look Into That.

219
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,283
But For Now,
Can You Hook A Buddy Up?

220
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:02,088
You Know, Poole,
It's Not Exactly My Thing

221
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,958
To Make A Clown
Out Of Myself In Public.

222
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:07,795
I-- I Usually
Leave That To You.

223
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,363
I Mean, What If Somebody
Finds Out It's Me?

224
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:13,901
Pete, Dude,
I Need This To Be A Secret More Than You Do.

225
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,071
Oh, Man.

226
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:23,077
Come On, Man.

227
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,581
Tommy: <I>Yes, Rooster Fans,
Another Big Game Today

228
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:30,016
- As The Armadillos-- 18 Wins And Two Losses--
- <I>(Cheering)

229
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,652
Take On Your Own
Ragin' Roosters,

230
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,723
Who Are Zero For 20.

231
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:39,026
It's Gonna Be Tough For The Roosters
To Beat A Team Of This Caliber.

232
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,626
<I>And Here We Go! Whoo!

233
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,330
<I>(Fanfare Music Playing)

234
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,036
Cheerleaders:<I>
Ready, Okay!

235
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,506
Throw 'Em In The Muck!
Cluck, Cluck, Cluck!

236
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,475
Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

237
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,810
Throw 'Em In The Muck!
Cluck, Cluck, Cluck!

238
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,747
<I>Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

239
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:03,483
So Are We Gonna Beat
Those Armadillos Tonight?

240
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:07,121
Cock-A-Doodle-Doo! Whoo!

241
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:08,756
(All Cheering)

242
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,058
Let's Go, Roosters!

243
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:14,862
- Still Got It.
- You Were The Best Chicken We Ever Had.

244
00:12:14,895 --> 00:12:17,131
Yeah, Well,
I Think My Boy Cleatus Has Got What It Takes

245
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:19,066
To Outshine Even Me.

246
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,767
I'm Not A Loser.
I'm Not A Loser--

247
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,102
Coach. Coach.
We're On Air.

248
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:24,838
Oh...

249
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:28,942
- Tommy: <I>To Tip-Off We Go.
- <I>(Whistle Blows)

250
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,981
<I>And The Ball Is Controlled
By The Armadillos Downcourt.

251
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:36,750
- <I>(Buzzer Sounds)
- <I>Armadillos Score!

252
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,885

00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,828
In The Entire State!

257
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,064
Hey! Put Me In!
I Can Win A Jump Ball.

258
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:53,066
(Clucks)

259
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,068
That's Right, Dill Pickle,
I'm Talking To You!

260
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:56,804
I Told You
Jam Can't Inbound!

261
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:59,439
I Should Just...
Inbound To Myself!

262
00:12:59,473 --> 00:13:02,142
Okay, Dill,
Inbound To Yourself.

263
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,178
Come On, Let's Go, Guys!

264
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:07,614

00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:18,191
Come On!
Dill, Live Up To Your Hair!

269
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:21,527
Okay? If I Had Hair Like That,
There's No Telling What I Could Do.

270
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,897
(Sputtering)

271
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:33,873

272
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,508

Okay, Let's Go,
Let's Go! Oh!

278
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:12,045
- (Buzzer Sounds)
- That Means You Stop Them From Scoring.

279
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,482
(Cheering)

280
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:19,852
Let's Get This Over With.
No One Knows It's Me.

281
00:14:19,886 --> 00:14:22,054
Just Walk Around,
Flap Your Wings,

282
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,623
Be Generally Annoying
Like Poole

283
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:25,892
For A Couple Of Hours
And Go Home.

284
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,593

285
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,563

What's Up?

288
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:34,535
All Right,
Here We Go.

289
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:37,737
- Hey, It's The Chicken! That's My Boy!
- He Looks Good.

290
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:39,906
- Get This Over With.
- Go, Dill!

291
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,742
This One's For You, Baby.

Tommy:<I>
It's Taken Away Again!

293
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:45,778

Okay, Let's Go, Here.
Let's Go! Come On!

295

Pa--

310
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:44,103
Time Out, Please.

- All Right!
- Whoo!

314
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:51,677
Forget It. Sorry, Poole,
I'm Out Of Here.

315
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,212

A Little Pride Left.

Is All Right.

Oh, He's Fine.
He's All Right.

321
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:09,128
He's Got Padding
Under Those Feathers, Right?

322
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,230
Jack: <I>Well, No, No.
The School Didn't Spring

323

00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,790
I'm Giving Them
Something To Notice.

338
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,382
(Clucking)

339
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,066
(Clucking)

340
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:21,100
(All Laughing)

341
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:23,770
Go, Rooster!

342
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:26,106
Come On!
Good D, Good D, Good D!

343
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:28,308
Come On!

344
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,478
(All Laughing)

345
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:33,213
There We Go,
There We Go! No, No, No!

346
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:36,816
- (Shouting)
- (All Laughing Loudly)

347
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,385
Let's Go! Three!

348
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:42,289
Three!

349
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:46,760
(Muttering)
Ah, Here We Go Again!

350
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,828
Go Ahead! Just Go Ahead!
Come On, Get Back, Get Back!

351
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,396
Back, Back, Back,
Back, Back, Back!

352
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,434
- Come On! No!
- (Buzzer Sounds)

353
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:00,172
(Screams)

354
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,109
- Poole! Poole.
- (Clucking)

355
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:04,911
Just-- Okay.

356
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,379
- (Clucking)
- Don't-- Just Stop That.

357
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:09,216
- Just Stop It, Stop It!
- (Clucking Rapidly)

358
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:11,719
Stop It, Stop It! Okay!

359
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:15,122
Okay, That's It.
That's It.

360
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:18,258
- Get Off The Court!
- (Squeals)

361
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,127
- (Whistle Blows)
- What?

362
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,461
- Technical Foul.
- What?

363
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:23,530
- Did You See The Chicken Was On The--
- (Whistle Blows)

364
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,866
- What Are You-- Come On!
- You're Out Of Here!

365
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:28,200
- (All Laughing)
- There's A Giant Chicken!

366
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,903
- You're Out Of Here!
- Oh, Come On!

367
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,739
- You're Out Of Here!
- That's Ridiculous!

368
00:18:33,106 --> 00:18:35,108
(Clucking)

369
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:50,224
(Sputtering, Backfiring)

370
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,865
- Pete.
- Hey.

371
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:00,800
- How'd It Go?
- Good, I Guess.

372
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:03,136
You Might Want
To Dry-Clean The Chicken.

373
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,905
I Fell A Lot.

374
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,440
(Sneezing)

375
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:11,178
- I Guess Dry-Cleaning Expenses Can Be On Me.
- Yeah.

376
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,347
Okay, Thanks, Pete.

377
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,149
And Rest Assured,
Operation "Make Camie Fall In Love With Pete"

378
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:19,252
Will Commence Tonight.

379
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:20,986
All Right.
Just Keep Me Posted.

380
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,290
- Right. Good Night.
- Good Night.

381
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,993
Hey, Pete. Thanks.

382
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:30,798
I Know You Must Have Hated
Being The Chicken.

383
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:37,270
<I>(School Bell Rings)

384
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,472
So, Pete, The Chicken
Worked Good, Huh?

385
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,440
- Nice One, Poole.
- Wasn't So Bad.

386
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,511
- Girl: Hey, Poole.
- Good Work, Chicken.

387
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,111
Thanks.

388
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:48,013
- Whoa, Dude.
- Boy: Good Job, Man.

389
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:49,550
I Guess The Game
Went Good, Huh?

390
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,552
Yeah.
Yeah, I Think It Went All Right.

391
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:56,256
I Want Poole Expelled!

392
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:57,991
He's A Menace!
Hanging From The Girders,

393
00:19:58,023 --> 00:19:59,992
Teasing The Officials.

394
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,261
It's Not Funny
And It's Not Safe.

395
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:04,196
He Made A Mockery
Of The Team!

396
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,334
Seems To Me The Team Did A
Pretty Good Job Of That All By Itself.

397
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:10,270
- (Chuckles)
- Oh That's Nice, Fred. That's Great.

398
00:20:10,302 --> 00:20:14,174
Thank You For That. You Know,
I Would Never Say Something Like That To You.

399
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:16,475
- I'm Sorry, Coach, I'm Sorry.
- <I>(Phones Ringing)

400
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,279
But Your Team
Is Just Not Good.

401
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:22,281
I Don't Know Whether It's Because
The Athletes Are All Horrible

402
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:25,218
Or Because You Need
More Practice Being A Coach,

403
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,220
But Let Me Put It This Way--

404
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,655
Right Now, That Chicken
Has Greater Job Security

405
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,224
Than You Do.

406
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,030
<I>(School Bell Rings)

407
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,473
What Up, Fellas?

408
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:49,442
Good Game Friday Night!

409
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:53,946
Wow, Poole.
You Got Some Guts.

410
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,116
- Right, Boys?
- Mm-Hmm.

411
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:58,117
Thanks, Dell.
Guts Kinda Runs In The Family.

412
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,286
They Actually Called
My Grandpa "Grandpa Guts."

413
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:04,324
You Might Want To Consider A New Career Path,

414
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:08,560
- Because This One Goes Straight To The Frying Pan.
- (Gulps)

415
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:10,397
That's Funny, Dill--
Frying Pan.

416
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,098
Fried Chicken,
Get It?

417
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,533
- Do You Get It?
- Yes, Floyd, I Get It.

418
00:21:14,567 --> 00:21:17,002
And I'll Be Going Now.

419
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:19,039
Freeze!

420
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:24,978
Let Him Go.
Let Him Go. Let Him Go.

421
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:28,481
Coach, He Made
People Laugh At Us.

422
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,215
He Belittled Us
And You!

423
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,552
That's His Job.
He's A Mascot.

424
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:36,155
One Feather On His Scrawny
Little Head Gets Touched,

425
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:38,357
You Go Three Rounds
With Me, <I>Comprende?

426
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,326
(Whispers)<I>
Comprende?

427
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,096
Understand.

428
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:44,396
(Grunts)

429
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,134
Okay. Knew That
Was Gonna Happen.

430
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,136
Thanks, Coach.
I Feel Like They Were

431
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:53,539
Channeling Their Anger
At Me Instead Of Each Other.

432
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,307
That's Just My Theory.

433
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,209
- I Don't Like You, Poole.
- Huh?

434
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:59,111
And I Don't Like
The Chicken, Get It?

435
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:02,147
- Okay.
- I Wish I Could Cut Those Boys Loose,

436
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:05,285
Play Patty-Cake With Your Face,
But I'd Lose My Job.

437
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:08,488
And That Is The Only Reason
You Are Still Upright.

438
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,991
W-What Did I Do
That Was So Bad?

439
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,292
Oh, Don't Play Dumb
With Me, Mop-Top.

440
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:16,626
You Know What You Did
Out On That Court

441
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:18,131
And Let's Just Say
Some Feelings Were Hurt.

442
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,233
And Hurt Feelings...

443
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,103
Stink.
(Whimpering)

444
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:26,272
(Crying)

445
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,209
<I>(School Bell Rings)

446
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,647
(Applauding, Cheering)

447
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:42,155
(Giggling)

448
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,657
You Were So Funny
Friday Night.

449
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,494
I Will Never Have A Wrestler Beat You Up Again.

450
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:49,295
Ah-Ah-Ah!

451
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,196
Ahem, Well,

452
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,434
It Is Only Fitting That We Have Our Chicken Present

453
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:58,037
- <I>When We Talk About The Rooster Day Celebration.
- Hi.

454
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,307
I Need Two Volunteers
From This Class

455
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,309
To Be On
The Float Committee.

456
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,615
Oh, Come On, Citizens.
(Groans)

457
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,650
Pete Ivey.
Hey, Pete.

458
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:13,752
What About You?

459
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:17,190
This Could Be A Great Way To
Make A Name For Yourself, Huh?

460
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:19,259
<I>Think About It.

461
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,226
I'll Volunteer,
Ms. Banfield.

462
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,796
Oh, That Would Be
Wonderful, Angela.

463
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:25,697
So Then It Is
Angela Morrissey

464
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:28,468
And Pete Ivey
On The Float Committee,

465
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:30,470
The Two New Kids In School.
That Is Perfect.

466
00:23:30,502 --> 00:23:32,504
I Didn't Realize You Were A New Kid In School.

467
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,374
- I'm Not. She--
- Save It For The Float Committee!

468
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,343
Okay.

469
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:42,749
Poole: <I>Okay, All Right, Guys.
One More Time.

470
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:47,153
Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!
Power To The Poultry.

471
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:49,188
- <I>(Cheering)
- All Right.

472
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:50,690
Yo, Pete!

473
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:52,192
I'm Sorry, Guys,
I Gotta Run.

474
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:54,327
But There Will Be
Another Show Later.

475
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:56,161
- When, Later?
- Huh?

476
00:23:56,194 --> 00:23:58,432
How About Later After School?
You And Me?

477
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,501
- So What Do You Say?
- Yes, Please.

478
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,773
(Giggles)

479
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:09,576
Okay, Did Everybody
See That?

480
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:12,444
- Okay, Everyone. Let's Get Started.
- Sorry I'm Late.

481
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:15,315
<I>I-- I Just
Got Lost Again.

482
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:18,117
There's Just So Much You
Gotta Learn With A New School.

483
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,319
Put A Dollar
In The Late Jar.

484
00:24:20,353 --> 00:24:23,256
Good, So We Have
Bob's Uncle's Tractor

485
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,592
<I>To Pull The Float.

486
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:28,427
<I>Let's See, What Else?

487
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:34,300
- <I>The Next Order Of Business...
- Here, I Gotcha.

488
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:35,734
Thanks, I'll Pay You Back.

489
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:37,703
Maybe We Can Build
A Big Rocket Ship

490
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:41,874
And Paint Something On It,
Like, I Dunno, "Go Roosters."

491
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:45,278
Really?
A Rocket Ship?

492
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,415
That's The Best You Got?
Rocket Ship?

493
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:52,318
I'm Outta Here.
Good Luck Without Me.

494
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,154
It Was Just
My First Idea.

495
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:57,357
- What Else You Got?
- Uh... Space Shuttle.

496
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,798
- Hey, Listen Up. Angela's Got An Idea.
- <I>(Door Closes)

497
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,200
Well, I Don't-- I Don't Want To Be Pushy Or Anything--

498
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:11,703
No, Hey, It's Wide Open.
What's Up? Come On.

499
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:14,239
Uh... Well...

500
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:17,276
Um...

501
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,578
Okay, Well-- Well,
It Seems To Me

502
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,513
Everyone
Likes The Chicken,

503
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,216
So...

504
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,419
Why Don't We Try
To Use Him Somehow?

505
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:29,955
- I Like It.
- Girl: <I>Any Specific Idea?

506
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:32,292
Put The Chicken
On A Rocket Ship!

507
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,595
(Sighs) Anyone Besides Bob Got An Idea?

508
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,831
Angela! Angela, Hey!

509
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:42,335
- Hey!
- Hey, Your Idea Was Awesome In There.

510
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:43,836
- Oh, Thanks.
- Yeah.

511
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:46,205
You're, Uh, Peter, Right?

512
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,208
Yeah, Pete.
That's The Name.

513
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:50,343
Oh, Don't Worry.
I'll Definitely Give You Your Dollar Back Tomorrow.

514
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:52,845
Oh, Keep It.
I've Got Like 20 More Where That Came From.

515
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:55,948
(Giggles)
Good.

516
00:25:55,982 --> 00:25:58,952
Hey, You Want A Ride Home?
My Car's Just Right There.

517
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:01,788
Oh, No, No, Thanks.
I'm Gonna Walk.

518
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,257
It's Kinda My Exercise
For The Day, But Thanks.

519
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,759
Really.

520
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,427
I Like To Walk, Yeah.

521
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:10,762
- Good For The Lungs, Right?
- Yes, That It Is.

522
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:12,699
I'll Walk With You.

523
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:15,534
Don't You Have A Car?

524
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:19,439
Well, Yeah.
Yeah, But It's So Bad For The Environment.

525
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:22,508
- Right.
- I Was Thinking About Donating It To A--

526
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,278
- Like A Foundation.
- Oh. Oh, Yeah?

527
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,013
- Yeah.
- <I>Well, My Boyfriend Back In Houston,

528
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:30,683
He Volunteers
For A Nursing Home.

529
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,417
They're Always
Looking For Donations.

530
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:34,886
Well, I Will--
I Will Strongly Consider

531
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,989
Donating My Car To--
To Your Boyfriend.

532
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:39,259
Cool.

533
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,327
Yep.

534
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,795
Um, Well, Uh--
I-- I--- I Better Go.

535
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:45,831
So Bye, Pete.

536
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,635
Bye.

537
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,740

538
00:26:53,772 --> 00:26:55,809

539
00:26:59,345 --> 00:27:00,880
Poole:<I>

541
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:09,289
<I>(Tv Chattering)

542
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:10,723
Here You Go.

543
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,463

544
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:19,965

545
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:21,467
- What's Up?
- What Are You Doing Here?

546
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,502
Listen, Partner,
We Gotta Talk.

547
00:27:23,536 --> 00:27:25,772
I Need To Know What You Did
At The Game Friday.

548
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:28,341
- I Don't Know, I Just Improvised.
- Improvised?

549
00:27:28,374 --> 00:27:30,309
Like How, Pete?
I Mean, Did Ya--

550
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,010
Did You Use Props,
Catchphrases?

551
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:33,512
Can You Please Just
Give Me Some Details?

552
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:35,782
I Don't Know.

553
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:38,318
I Followed The Coach
Around A Little Bit.

554
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,786
- I Made Fun Of Him.
- That Explains A Lot.

555
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:42,054
I Got In The Other
Team's Huddle.

556
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:45,325
- That Got A Big Laugh.
- Pete, You Do Realize That You Broke

557
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:47,627
All Of The Mascot
Rules, Right?

558
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:51,530
I'm-- I'm Sorry.

559
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:53,465
<I>I Just Went With It.

560
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,101
I've Never Acted
Like That Before.

561
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:57,002
It's Cool, Man.
I Really Don't Care.

562
00:27:57,036 --> 00:28:00,106
The Important Thing Is
I Might Be Kissing Jamie Wynn

563
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,507
- By Week's End.
- Yeah...

564
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,010
All 'Cause Of Me.

565
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,411
Don't Think This
Is Going Unrewarded, Okay?

566
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:09,415
I Mean, Um, Camie Was
Just Asking Me About You.

567
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:11,117
Whatever.
Camie's Not Into Me.

568
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:14,052
(Gagging)
Really?

569
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:17,857
Why Did She Ask If You Get Sweaty Palms
When You Hold Hands With A Girl, Eh?

570
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:20,859
- Why'd She Ask That, Pete?
- (Grunts)

571
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:22,862
- Really?
- Mm-Hmm.

572
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:24,731
What'd You Say?

573
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:27,766
I Mean, I Do Sometimes,
But It Depends.

574
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,635
- No, Man, I'm Just Kidding.
- (Groans)

575
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,937
<I>She Actually
Hasn't Asked That Yet.

576
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,606
But, Pete...

577
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:36,442
I'm Prepared To Defend
All Of Your Flaws.

578
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:38,444
<I>Okay, Here's The Deal:

579
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:40,479
I Need You To Teach Me
The Routine.

580
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,749
All I Remember Is Everybody Was Staring At Me.

581
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:46,485
<I>And Then, I Don't Know,
Something Clicked.

582
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:49,021
Clicked?
Pete, I Need Specifics.

583
00:28:49,053 --> 00:28:51,590
<I>You Realize That
I Will Probably Never

584
00:28:51,624 --> 00:28:53,992
Be This Popular
Ever Again In My Life.

585
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,927
I Know, Even Angela
Morrissey's A Fan.

586
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,598
- Morrissey's A Fan?
- Yeah.

587
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:01,533
Sweet.

588
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,137
Okay, Pete.
What Is It?

589
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:07,006
I Mean, You Want To Be A Friend,
A Best Friend?

590
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,541
'Cause That's What I'm
Telling People That We Are.

591
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:13,845
All Right, I'll Show
You Some Moves.

592
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,548
Perfect.

593
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:19,085
Oh My Goodness, Pete.

594
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,553
I'm A Genius.
You're Gonna Be The Chicken Tomorrow.

595
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:24,891
And I'll Be In The Stands
Watching You Do What You Do.

596
00:29:24,924 --> 00:29:26,759
And You Can Count It.

597
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:28,694
That'll Work.
People See You In The Stands,

598
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,061
They Know You're
Not In The Suit.

599
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:33,098
Pete, I'm Not Stupid, Man.

600
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,802
That Base
Will Be Covered.

601
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:37,603
- Poole?
- Hmm?

602
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,806
Your Helmet's Backwards.

603
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,510
- I Knew My Helmet Was Backwards--
- Just Looking Out For Ya.

604
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,578
It's Gonna
Be Fine, Pete. Okay?

676
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:20,893
(Clucking)

677
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,795
It Was Sweet Of You
To Pick Me To Run Away With.

678
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:26,732
(Clucks Shyly)

679
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:28,233
Crowd:<I>
Chicken! Chicken!

680
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,969
- <I>Chicken!
- Bawk?

681
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:32,905
I Think Your Fans
Are Calling.

682
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:34,674
(Clucking)

683
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,246
Well, I Should Get Back
To My Cheering.

684
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,382
(Clucks)

685
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,388
(Clucking Softly)

686
00:33:50,422 --> 00:33:52,992
Well, Thank You.

687
00:33:56,962 --> 00:34:00,299
<I>(Crowd Cheering)

688
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,174
(Backfiring, Sputtering)

689
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,878
Pete!

690
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:16,114
Dude, You Were Amazing!

691
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,150
You Know, Now I Know
Why Everybody Loves Me.

692
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,485
<I>(Chuckles)
Anyways, I Gotta Run.

693
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,220
I Got A Date With Jamie.

694
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,189
- Isn't This Great?
- Yeah, For You.

695
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:26,424
Everyone Still Thinks You're The Chicken.
I'm Just Boring Old Pete Ivey.

696
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:29,061
Monday Morning I'm Gonna Be The Kid In
The Back Of The Room Nobody Knows.

697
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,063
Okay, Pete.

698
00:34:31,096 --> 00:34:33,232
I Mean, Maybe You're Right.
You Should Be Getting More Out Of This

699
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:35,467
Than All The Groundwork I've
Been Laying Down With My Sister.

700
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,168
- (Laughs)
- <I>Trust Me, Pete.

701
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,970
- <I>Dude, She's Coming Around.
- I'm Sure She Is.

702
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:41,339
Here's What We're Gonna Do.

703
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,108
You're Gonna
Be The Chicken

704
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:44,442
Full-Time.
All Right.

705
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:46,145
What-- What Are You--

706
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:48,313
What Do You Mean,
Full-Time?

707
00:34:48,346 --> 00:34:51,916
What About That Allergy-Proof
Chicken Head Or Whatever?

708
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,351
(Stammers)

709
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,186
The Financing
Dried Up.

710
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,922
You Know, The Pta Shot Down
Principal Daly's Request

711
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,391
For The Thousand Bucks,

712
00:34:59,424 --> 00:35:01,259
Something About
Fire Extinguishers

713
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:03,929
Being A Better Resource Of--
I Don't Know.

714
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:06,297
It's Politics, Man.

715
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,233
Say, Poole,
Does This...

716
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:11,469
Custom-Built Hypoallergenic Head Really Even Exist?

717
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:14,273
Yea-- No.
(Laughing)

718
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,908
No, Pete.
No, It Doesn't.

719
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:19,011
Why Do I Ever Believe Anything You Ever Say Anymore?

720
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:21,212
Because We're Best Friends.

721
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:24,049
Now, Pete, Are You In
Or Are You Out?

722
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,152
Well...

723
00:35:26,184 --> 00:35:28,953
I Don't Know.
I'm Just Not Sure About Being The Chicken Full-Time.

724
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:31,023
Well, I Mean,
If People Were To Find Out

725
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:33,958
That It Was Just Boring Old Pete Ivey In The Suit,

726
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,360
They'd Expect Me
To Be This...

727
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:39,030
Hey-Check-Me-Out-
I'm-Crazy

728
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:40,398
Kinda Guy
All The Time.

729
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:42,934
And It's Not Me.
That's You.

730
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,538
Okay, Pete, I Don't
Ever Recall Saying

731
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,174
That We Could Let People In On Our Little Secret Here.

732
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:50,108
Oh. Oh, So I Keep
Being The Chicken,

733
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:52,243
- You Keep Getting The Credit?
- Yeah.

734
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,547
- What?!
- Pete, It's A Win-Win, Dude.

735
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:57,116
Wait. Wait, Wait, Wait.
How Is It A Win-Win?

736
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:59,184
Uh, Simple. I Get
The Benefit Of Fame,

737
00:35:59,217 --> 00:36:00,985
The Poole Family
Tradition Lives On.

738
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:03,154
Let's Not
Forget About Jamie.

739
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:06,592
And You-- You Get To Have
Fun In A Chicken Suit.

740
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,161
Pete, It Doesn't Get
Better Than That.

741
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,166
- It Is Kinda Fun.
- Yeah, It Is.

742
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:17,268
I Mean, I'm Kinda
Good At It.

743
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:20,940
Good? Pete.
Dude, You're Amazing.

744
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:24,175
I Mean, No Poole Has
Ever Been This Good.

745
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,610
You're A Natural,
Baby.

746
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:27,879
You Got All The Moves
And Stuff.

747
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:32,451
All Right.
Yeah, I'll Do It.

748
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,252
- Why Not?
- You're Gonna Do It?

749
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:36,121
- Yeah, I'll Do It.
- Perfect. I'll Call You.

750
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,956
- Cool.
- All Right. You're Gonna Do It.

751
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:39,424
- Yeah.
- You're My-- You're My Big Chicken.

752
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,127
- <I>Why Not?
- Okay.

753
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,565
<I>(Door Opens, Closes)

754
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,266
I Want Him Gone, Fred!

755
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:50,002
I Can't Keep My Mind
In The Game!

756
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:52,337
The-- The Crowd Isn't Even
Looking At The Court Anymore.

757
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:55,340
Excuse Me, Coach-- Something
I Remembered I Had To Do.

758
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,087
Let's See Here.

759
00:37:09,121 --> 00:37:11,456
Roosters Have Scored
24 Points All Season.

760
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:16,128
Their Opponents...

761
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:19,130
Hmm.

762
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:26,371
<I>(Door Opens, Closes)

763
00:37:33,244 --> 00:37:37,116
Okay, So After This,
We Need 14' Of Chicken Wire.

764
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,083
- Ah, Chicken Wire.
- Mm-Hmm.

765
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:41,619
That Would Be
In The Wire Department

766
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:43,421
Under "Chicken."

767
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:47,159
Or Would It Be
In The Chicken Department...

768
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:50,029
Both:
Under "Wire"?

769
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,498
(Laughing)

770
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:55,634
So What Did You
Hear From Houston?

771
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,304
- You Mean My Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

772
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:01,473
Well, He Made Captain
Of The Debate Team.

773
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,341
Oh, Sounds Like
A Fun Guy.

774
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:05,710
Yeah.
Yeah, He, Uh...

775
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:08,447
- Sure Likes To Argue.
- (Police Radio Chatter)

776
00:38:09,614 --> 00:38:12,016
So, Pete, Um...

777
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:15,954
Cleatus Poole-- He, Uh-- He's A Friend Of Yours,
Isn't He?

778
00:38:15,987 --> 00:38:18,056
I Mean, Only Since
Kindergarten.

779
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,059
- Why?
- Oh, No Reason.

780
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,561
Just-- He, Um, Seems
Like An Interesting Person.

781
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:26,030
He's Complex, Isn't He?

782
00:38:26,063 --> 00:38:28,266
(Laughs)
Poole?

783
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:31,436
- Yeah.
- I Just Never Really Considered The Concept.

784
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:34,305
Well, I Mean,
It's Like By Day,

785
00:38:34,338 --> 00:38:37,275
He's Just This,
Kind Of Ordinary--

786
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:39,277
- Really, Really Ordinary...
- <I>Yeah, Ordinary.

787
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:41,113
- ...Guy.
- You Know, When He's The Chicken...

788
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:44,115
He's Just So...
Different.

789
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:45,451
Well, How Different?

790
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:49,154
- <I>What Do You Mean?
- I Dunno, He's--

791
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:52,123
He's Brash
And Bold And Daring

792
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:53,625
And He's So Funny.

793
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:56,362
Angela, Are You
Saying You're Like,

794
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:58,563
Interested In Poole
Because He's The Chicken?

795
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:02,066
- Oh--
- Susie: I Found The Putty. It's A Little Pricey,

796
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,670
But Good Putty
Is Worth Every Cent.

797
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:07,373
Did You Get Any Twine?
Where's The Twine?

798
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,308
I Didn't See Twine
On The List.

799
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,043
Come On, Twine's
The Main Thing.

800
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:13,012
You Don't Build A Float Without A Big Old Ball Of Twine.

801
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:16,282
Come On, It's-- It's Back In The Twine Aisle.
You Can't Miss It.

802
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:19,251
Thank You.
Anyways...

803
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:21,286
Um... Oh, Poole.

804
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:23,322
Oh, It's Nothing, Really.

805
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:25,724
I Mean, He's Got
A Girlfriend Anyways, Right?

806
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:28,226
- Right.
- And You Have A Boyfriend,

807
00:39:28,259 --> 00:39:31,062
- <I>Let's Not Forget That.
- Oh. Yeah, Yeah.

808
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,630
- Yeah.
- Of Course.

809
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,566
All Right, Where's
That Stupid Chicken Wire?

810
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:40,439
- (All Cheering)
- Yeah!

811
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:42,240
Jam, Knock It Off!

812
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:44,210
<I>Give Her Pompoms
Back Right Now!

813
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,713
(Clucking)

814
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:01,526
(Squawking)

815
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:06,732
Ready, Okay!
Throw 'Em In The Muck!

816
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:08,232
Cluck, Cluck, Cluck!

817
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,536
Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

818
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:12,503
Throw 'Em In The Muck!
Cluck, Cluck, Cluck!

819
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:14,839
Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

820
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:17,108
Whoo!

821
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:19,377
Hey, You Wanna Go
Somewhere After The Game?

822
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:21,079
- Bawk.
- Where?

823
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:23,214
- Bawk?
- Come On, Cleatus, Talk To Me.

824
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:25,717
- Bawk Bawk.
- We Could Miss The Bus.

825
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,219
Have To Find
Our Own Way Home...

826
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:29,688
- Bawk?
- Cleatus!

827
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,391
Cut It Out! What's With
The Silent Treatment?

828
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,094
I Bet I Know.
Poole's Not In There.

829
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:37,262
- Bawk!
- (Laughs)

830
00:40:37,295 --> 00:40:39,530
- (Clucking Nervously)
- Of Course It's Poole.

831
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,599
- It Is You, Isn't It?
- Bawk!

832
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:44,669
See? What Are You
Getting At, Dill?

833
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:46,704
Does Anybody Remember
Poole Being This Funny?

834
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:50,208
- (Chattering) - No.
It's Only The Last Couple Of Games He's Come Alive.

835
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:51,877
And You Don't Just Wake Up
One Day And Be Funny.

836
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:55,246
Whatever.
Of Course It's Poole.

837
00:40:55,279 --> 00:40:58,716
Well Then,
There Shouldn't Be A Problem To Check And Make Sure.

838
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,822
(Clucking Nervously)

839
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:08,327
(Sneezes)
Whoo!

840
00:41:10,362 --> 00:41:13,599
It Was Poole.
Told Ya!

841
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,400
(All Laugh)

842
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,636
Don't Scare Me
Like That. Okay?

843
00:41:17,668 --> 00:41:19,170

Hear About This.

Hear About This.

- You Made Me Poke My Eye!
- You Watch It.

925
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:09,628
It's Not Easy Getting
Out Of This Thing.

926
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:12,898
Hey, Man.
What's With You Saving Angela Out There?

927
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:15,599
You Should've Saved Jamie!
What Were You Thinking?

928
00:46:15,632 --> 00:46:18,203
You Know, Pete,
You Weren't Thinking Is What You Were Doing.

929
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:19,737
You Need To Get
Your Head In The Game.

930
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,572
It's Hard Out There, Poole.

931

I'm Out There In The Trenches, Man.

Pete! I'm In
The Trenches Too!

Do Not Underestimate The Job Of Me
Promoting You To My Sister, Okay?

934
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,183
It's Subtle Yet Consistent.

935
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:35,086

Into Marketing When I Get Older.

But I'm Over Her Now.

It Was Really Me--

Okay, Pete,
Stop Talking Right Now.

You Can't Tell Her.

- Can Be Really Difficult On You.
- Yeah.

But Guess Who Else Has
To Deal With It, Pete.

946
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:00,611
- Superman.
- Yeah, Well It's Lame Being Clark Kent

947
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:03,849
- When Superman's The Only One That Gets Noticed.
- But Clark Never Complains.

He Doesn't Back Out.

977

I Can't Blame Him.
My Stock Is Pretty High These Days.

1011

Whatever You Say.

1013
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,904
Yeah.
We've Been Hanging Out A Lot Lately.

1014
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:14,705
He's Really
Proud Of The Chicken.

1015
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:16,775
Or-- I Mean Me.

1016
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,878
He's Carrying A Picture Of Us In His Wallet Right Now.

1017
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:23,148
I Mean, Obviously He Thinks It's Me,
But It's Really You--

1018
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:26,117
Pete, I Cannot
Take It Anymore!

1019
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,753
- What's The Matter?
- Dude, I'm A Fraud.

1020
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:30,054
Okay, My Dad's
Walking Around

1021
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:32,156
Talking About How Proud
He Is Of The Chicken.

1022
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,825
But It's Really You, Pete.

1023
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:35,894
You Know,
He's Proud Of You Because You're The Chicken!

1024
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:38,096
You Know, If He Knew How Bad
Of A Chicken I Really Was,

1025
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:40,732
He Would Never
Talk To Me Again.

1026
00:50:40,764 --> 00:50:42,099
Poole, Your Dad
Doesn't Care

1027
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:44,335
If You're A Good Chicken Or
Even If You Are The Chicken.

1028
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,237
Your Family Loves You
No Matter What.

1029
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,773
- You See, Pete, I Understand That In Theory.
- (Pats)

1030
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:51,242
Trust Me, It's True.

1031
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:56,146
You're A Really
Good Friend, Pete.

1032
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:59,149
I'm Really Sorry That This Whole
Thing Has Been Really Hard On You.

1033
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:01,186
You Were Right, Though.
You Know?

1034
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:03,021
We Should Just--
We Should Call It Quits

1035
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:04,989
<I>And Let The Cat
Out Of The Bag.

1036
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,991
Whoa, Whoa.
What If I'm Not Funny Without The Suit?

1037
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:10,427
Come On, Pete.
You're A Funny Guy.

1038
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,830
You Just Have To Let
Everybody See That

1039
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,398
Without Wearing Your Chicken Suit.
Come On.

1040
00:51:14,431 --> 00:51:16,400
- Hey, Everybody!
- No!

1041
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:19,770
Look, You Know What?

1042
00:51:19,804 --> 00:51:21,338
Let's Just Keep
The Cat In The Bag

1043
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:24,842
At Least Until After The Parade.
I Mean, What's The Rush, Really?

1044
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:27,478
- Right? Your Guilt's Not Going Anywhere.
- Yeah, I Guess.

1045
00:51:27,512 --> 00:51:29,347
Look, I'm Sorry, Poole.
I Can't Switch Right Now.

1046
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,483
Look, I Did You A Favor.
Do Me One.

1047
00:51:32,483 --> 00:51:34,152
- Pete!
- What?

1048
00:51:34,184 --> 00:51:37,188
- What Do We Do With The Twine?
- Twine? Who Needs Twine?

1049
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:38,889
Have You Seen Angela?
I Don't Know Where She Is.

1050
00:51:38,922 --> 00:51:42,025
No, I Think She Might Have Gone Home Or Something.

1051
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,927
Well...

1052
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,497
Angela Organized
This Whole Thing.

1053
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,299
Poole, Take Over.

1054
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:52,002
For Real Though,
I Have Like A Mile And A Half Of Twine Here.

1055
00:51:52,036 --> 00:51:53,905
Any Idea?
Come On.

1056
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:56,273
You Could...

1057
00:51:56,306 --> 00:51:58,175
Build Something.

1058
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:02,114
(Sputtering)

1059
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:11,989
Angela!

1060
00:52:15,192 --> 00:52:17,861
- Hi.
- Hey.

1061
00:52:17,895 --> 00:52:20,230
Why Aren't You
Building The Float?

1062
00:52:20,264 --> 00:52:23,068
The Better Question Is How Come
You're Not Building The Float?

1063
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,871
Angela, What's Wrong?

1064
00:52:27,904 --> 00:52:29,540
- (Sniffles)
- What Happened?

1065
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:34,145
I Got A Text Message Today
From Houston.

1066
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,248
I Got Dumped
In A Stupid Text Message,

1067
00:52:38,282 --> 00:52:40,085
Can You Believe It?

1068
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,987
Coward.

1069
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,556
Did You Know That 86 % Of All
Long- Distance Relationships

1070
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,392
Are Doomed To Failure?

1071
00:52:48,893 --> 00:52:50,395
That Sounds High.

1072
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:53,431
Yeah, Well,
He Attached A Link.

1073
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:57,034
I Checked It Out.

1074
00:52:57,067 --> 00:52:59,469
It's Pretty Accurate.

1075
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:02,307
Stupid Debaters.

1076
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:06,211
That Must've Been A Pretty
Annoying Habit To Deal With.

1077
00:53:06,244 --> 00:53:08,246
Must Be Lots Of Other
Lame Stuff About Him.

1078
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:11,349
Uh, I Don't Know.
I Don't Want To Rip On The Guy.

1079
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:12,983
He Broke Up
With You With A Text.

1080
00:53:13,016 --> 00:53:14,918
- Dude Sleeps With His Rabbit!
- Weak.

1081
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:17,221
And He Refuses To Eat Anything That's Not Orange.

1082
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:20,258
- What A Loser.
- And He Dry Heaves A Lot.

1083
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:22,260
Well, That's-- That's Kind Of A Clinical Condition.

1084
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:23,995
There's Really Not
Anything He Can Do About--

1085
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:29,099
Pete?
(Chuckles)

1086
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:32,469
Um...

1087
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:36,207
Angela, Have I Ever
Dry Heaved Around You?

1088
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,578
No. And Believe Me,
I Would Have Remembered.

1089
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,547
Yeah, Cool.

1090
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:45,482
Well, We Can Talk
About Dry Heaving Some More

1091
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:47,319
Or We Can Go Build A Float.

1092
00:53:49,654 --> 00:53:51,623
I Think I'll Go
With Building A Float.

1093
00:53:51,655 --> 00:53:53,291
Me Too.

1094
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:55,994
Come On.
Car's Right Up Here.

1095
00:53:56,027 --> 00:53:57,662
I Think I'll Take You Up
On That Ride.

1096
00:53:57,695 --> 00:53:59,264
I Don't Think
I Can Make You Walk.

1097
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:00,932
(Marching Band Playing)

1098
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,351
- <I>Go Roosters!
- (Parents Chattering)

1099
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:48,079
Can You
Believe It, Deputy?

1100
00:54:48,112 --> 00:54:50,348
All These People
Voted For Me.

1101
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,282
They Didn't All Vote
For You, Uncle Lou.

1102
00:54:52,315 --> 00:54:54,418
It Wasn't Exactly
A Landslide.

1103
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:57,221
Don't Call Me
Uncle Lou.

1104
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:03,293
(Crowd Cheering, Chanting)

1105
00:55:03,326 --> 00:55:05,629
(Whistle Blows)

1106
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:12,103
Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

1107
00:55:12,136 --> 00:55:13,570
Whoo!

1108
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:17,474

- <I>(Pop Music Playing)
- Go, Roosters!

1110
00:55:20,177 --> 00:55:22,447
Whoo! Go, Roosters!

1111
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,349
<I> Uh-Oh, Why You
Holding Back Now? 

1112
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:28,151
<I> Don't You Know,
It's Time To Let Your Inner Freak Out? 

1113
00:55:28,184 --> 00:55:29,587

<I> Not When The Beat Is Kicki'
Like This Does 

1116
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:37,228
<I> Why Should I Care About
The Opinion Of Others? 

1117
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:40,063
<I> I Don't Want To Spend My Tie
Hiding Under The Covers 

1118

<I> Scared To Let It Loose,
Let Myself Go And Just Be Free 

1119
00:55:42,766 --> 00:55:45,402
<I> So I'ma Do What I Do Best,
That Means I'ma Do Me 

1120
00:55:45,436 --> 00:55:47,238

I'm Pecos Bill.

1159
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:13,324
- What?
- But, Cleatus, You're The Chicken.

1160
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,828
(Stammering) But-- But My Son Is The Chicken.

1161
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,196
Why Isn't He
In The Chicken Suit?

1162
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:20,264
Jamie:<I>
Great.

1163
00:57:20,297 --> 00:57:23,300
Now I Totally Made Out
With Poole For No Reason.

1164
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,069
Uh--

1165
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:27,572
So Who's The Chicken?

1173
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:16,221
I Was Hoping
It Wasn't Poole.

1174
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:22,159
You Went And Dropped
Your Hat, Uncle Lou.

1175
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:24,728
(Laughing)
That Was Crazy!

1176
00:58:31,235 --> 00:58:32,803
Oh, No, No, No, No!

1177
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,838
Okay! Okay! Jamie!

1178
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:37,308
Baby, Listen,

1179
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,476
This Doesn't Mean
We Have To Break Up.

1180
00:58:39,509 --> 00:58:41,811
Oh-Ho-Ho!
We're Breaking Up!

1181
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:44,381
- Expect A Visit From The Wrestling Team.
- Okay, Will Do.

1182
00:58:44,415 --> 00:58:46,583
- Let's Get Him Out Of Here.
- (Poole Protesting)

1183
00:58:47,851 --> 00:58:49,820
Law Enforcement
At Work Here, Folks.

1184
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,490
(Siren Wailing)

1185
00:58:56,994 --> 00:58:59,262
Poole:<I>
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

1186
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:01,464
Rock, Paper, Sci--

1187
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:03,266
You Know, It's A Lot
More Fun When We Both Play.

1188
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:05,435
Hi, Uncle Lou.

1189
00:59:05,469 --> 00:59:08,639
The Boys Found Your Car,
But That Chicken Was Long Gone.

1190
00:59:08,672 --> 00:59:10,942
- Don't Call Me Uncle Lou.
- Why Not?

1191
00:59:10,974 --> 00:59:12,909
Because People Will
Think I Hired You

1192
00:59:12,942 --> 00:59:14,811
Because We're Related.

1193
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:17,247
Let Me Get This Straight.
You're The Chicken?

1194
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,916
- Officially.
- Yeah, But Somebody Else Was In The Suit, Right?

1195
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:22,285
Oh, You're Both Smart.

1196
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:25,857
So Everyone Thought You Were In The Suit,
But You Really Weren't.

1197
00:59:26,857 --> 00:59:29,326
- Exactly.
- So...

1198
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,295
Who Was In The Suit?

1199
00:59:31,328 --> 00:59:34,232
Come On, Guys. I Cannot Tell You.
We Made A Promise.

1200
00:59:34,264 --> 00:59:37,268
Son, We're Talking Grand
Theft Automobile Here.

1201
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,337
That's Gta-Mobile.

1202
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:41,271
So You Better
Start Talking.

1203
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:43,406
Mm, Not Until I Get That

1204
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,576
Root Beer
I Asked For, Um...

1205
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:47,311
About An Hour Ago.

1206
00:59:48,311 --> 00:59:49,913
- (Scoffs)
- Well, Go Get It.

1207
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:51,583
Yeah, Uncle Lou.
Hey, Jack.

1208
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:00,024
- What's Up?
- Lou, Can You Give Us A Minute Here?

1209
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:02,526
- Sure, Jack.
- Thanks.

1210
01:00:05,929 --> 01:00:07,764
Well, Cleatus,
You Know, I Just--

1211
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:09,533
I Wish I Understood
Why You Did It.

1212
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:12,002
Dad, You Know What?

1213
01:00:12,036 --> 01:00:14,538
I'm Allergic To
The Chicken Suit, Okay?

1214
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,040
I Mean, Every Time
I Put The Thing On,

1215
01:00:16,072 --> 01:00:17,641
I Go Into
A Sneezing Fit

1216
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:19,643
And My Body
Gets All Itchy.

1217
01:00:19,677 --> 01:00:22,480
I Mean, I Didn't
Want To Quit.

1218
01:00:22,512 --> 01:00:25,049
I Think The Main
Thing Is-- Is That--

1219
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:28,319
- I Just Didn't Want To Let You Down.
- Yeah, Yeah.

1220
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:31,288
Let Me Tell You
Something, Cleatus.

1221
01:00:31,322 --> 01:00:34,025
I Was Allergic To The Chicken Suit Too.
(Chuckles)

1222
01:00:34,058 --> 01:00:35,559
Yeah. I Know.

1223
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:37,427
It's-- It Was Rough.

1224
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,297
I-- My Sinuses
Got All Stuffed Up.

1225
01:00:40,331 --> 01:00:43,300
My Eyes Watered.
My Fingers Swelled Up Like Hot Dogs.

1226
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:46,971
I Just-- You Know,
I Felt Like I Was Itching My Way Through High School.

1227
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:49,940
<I>(Sighs)
I Didn't Want To Quit Either

1228
01:00:49,973 --> 01:00:51,741
<I>For The Same Reasons.

1229
01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:54,578
I'm Proud Of You, Cleatus.

1230
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,315
<I>You Had The Guts To...

1231
01:00:57,348 --> 01:00:58,882
Fly The Coop

1232
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,351
Like I Should Have Done.

1233
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:05,355
Thanks, Dad.

1234
01:01:07,023 --> 01:01:10,493
But I Mean, You're Really Okay
With Me Not Being The Chicken?

1235
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,329
I Know It's
The Family Legacy.

1236
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,899
I'd Rather You Be
My Happy Son...

1237
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:19,070
<I>Than A Sneezing Chicken
Any Day.

1238
01:01:20,103 --> 01:01:23,373
Thanks, Dad.
Uh, Dad?

1239
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:26,476
Yeah?

1240
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:29,813
- I Think I'm Allergic To Math.
- Yeah, I'm Not Gonna Be Okay With That.

1241
01:01:29,846 --> 01:01:31,948
Okay, Cool.
Science? No.

1242
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:40,524
(Panting)

1243
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:51,101
(Car Horn Honks)

1244
01:01:59,643 --> 01:02:01,145
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey, Angela.

1245
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:02,880
Where Were You?

1246
01:02:02,913 --> 01:02:04,615
I Didn't See You
At The Parade.

1247
01:02:04,648 --> 01:02:08,085
- Oh No, I Was There.
- Oh, Float Turned Out Great, Huh?

1248
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:09,786
- Yeah.
- Good Work.

1249
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,088
Aw, I Just Did A Little
Sawing And Hammering,

1250
01:02:12,121 --> 01:02:13,257
Clocked Some Twine Time.

1251
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:16,059
(Laughs) Hey,
How About That Whole Chicken Thing?

1252
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:18,462
It's All Anybody
Can Talk About.

1253
01:02:18,494 --> 01:02:20,797
- Who Do You Think It Is?
- The Chicken?

1254
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:23,166
Yeah.

1255
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:26,370
I Don't Know. I Mean,
Do You Really Want To Know?

1256
01:02:27,704 --> 01:02:30,174
No, I-- I Guess Not.

1257
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:32,076
I Mean, Yes.

1258
01:02:32,108 --> 01:02:33,978
Well, I Mean...

1259
01:02:35,112 --> 01:02:37,447
Do You
Want To Know?

1260
01:02:38,815 --> 01:02:40,384
Yeah.

1261
01:02:42,186 --> 01:02:45,556
But I'm Afraid
Once The Mystery's Over...

1262
01:02:47,523 --> 01:02:49,659
So Is The Magic.

1263
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:58,169
- It's Sure Getting Colder.
- <I>Am I Crazy, Pete?

1264
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:02,540
- What?
- I Think I Was Actually Falling For A Guy

1265
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:05,074
In A Chicken Suit.
(Giggles)

1266
01:03:05,108 --> 01:03:07,745
- Really?
- You Don't Know How Relieved I Was

1267
01:03:07,777 --> 01:03:09,813
To Find Out
It Wasn't Poole.

1268
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:12,182
- Oh, Really?
- Yeah.

1269
01:03:16,152 --> 01:03:17,721
Do You Think
The Chicken'll Come Back?

1270
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:21,891
Probably Not,

1271
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:24,161
<I>So Long As Everyone Wants
To Know Who's In There.

1272
01:03:25,195 --> 01:03:27,532
Magic's In The Mystery,
Right?

1273
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:31,768
You're Right.

1274
01:03:32,936 --> 01:03:34,439
Wait.
No, I'm Right.

1275
01:03:35,572 --> 01:03:37,174
Okay, We're Both Right.

1276
01:03:37,206 --> 01:03:39,143
(Both Laugh)

1277
01:03:39,175 --> 01:03:41,945
- Hey, Do You Want A Ride?
- No, I'm Just Gonna Walk.

1278
01:03:41,978 --> 01:03:44,080
It's Kinda My Exercise
For The Day.

1279
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:46,183
(Chuckles)
Right.

1280
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:47,851
- Bye, Pete.
- See Ya.

1281
01:03:54,924 --> 01:03:56,493
(Horn Honks)

1282
01:04:14,143 --> 01:04:16,579
See That, Pete?
We Made The Newspaper.

1283
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:18,248
What Are You
Doing Here, Poole?

1284
01:04:18,282 --> 01:04:20,784
Look, Man, I'm
Sorry I Got Caught.

1285
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:23,020
Dumb, I Know.

1286
01:04:23,052 --> 01:04:24,654
But, I Mean, We Gotta Talk,

1287
01:04:24,688 --> 01:04:26,857
Decide What To Do Next.

1288
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:29,092
What You Mean Next?
I Stole The Sheriff's Car.

1289
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:32,896
So? Dude, You Had No Choice.
You Were Being Chased By A Mob.

1290
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:35,232
<I>You're Legally Allowed
To Do Whatever You Want

1291
01:04:35,264 --> 01:04:37,067
When You're Being
Chased By A Mob.

1292
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:39,235
- It's In The Constitution.
- Tell It To The Sheriff.

1293
01:04:39,268 --> 01:04:40,904
I, Uh, Already Did.

1294
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:42,106
Oh, Great.
Did You Tell Him Who I Am?

1295
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:44,275
No, Pete.
I Was Slippery

1296
01:04:44,308 --> 01:04:46,677
Like A-- Like
An Oiled-Up Watermelon.

1297
01:04:48,078 --> 01:04:50,179
Okay, Here's
What We're Gonna Do.

1298
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:52,115
We're Gonna Let
The Whole Thing Die, Right?

1299
01:04:52,148 --> 01:04:54,617
We're Gonna Retire The Chicken
And Let The Myth Grow.

1300
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:56,953
And Then Maybe
At Our 30th Reunion,

1301
01:04:56,987 --> 01:05:00,191
<I>We Tell Everybody It Was You Who
Turned The Chicken Into A Legend.

1302
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,295
- I Don't Know.
- Me Either.

1303
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,898
<I>(Marching Band
Playing)

1304
01:05:09,132 --> 01:05:11,769
Crowd: Chicken!
Chicken! Chicken!

1305
01:05:11,802 --> 01:05:14,137
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

1306
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,339
Chicken!
Chicken! Chicken!

1307
01:05:16,373 --> 01:05:20,177
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

1308
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,012
Chicken!
Chicken! Chicken!

1309
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:24,849
Attaboy, Deputy.

1310
01:05:27,985 --> 01:05:31,221
- Crowd: Chicken! Chicken!
- Ready, Okay!

1311
01:05:31,253 --> 01:05:33,690
Hey, Roosters!
Get To It!

1312
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:35,192
We Know
You Can Do It!

1313
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:38,626
Do You Think He'll Come?

1314
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:39,697
I Wouldn't Count On It.

1315
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,197
Well, Aren't You Just
Dying To Know Who He Is?

1316
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,033
Um... No.

1317
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:46,337
Not Really.

1318
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:48,371
...Cock-A-Doodle-Do It.

1319
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:50,240
Whoo!

1320
01:05:54,378 --> 01:05:57,213
Crowd<I>
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

1321
01:05:57,246 --> 01:05:59,248
Oh, Yeah!

1322
01:05:59,282 --> 01:06:01,752
Go Roosters!
We Rule!

1323
01:06:01,784 --> 01:06:03,186
- (Crowd Groaning)
- Man: <I>Come On!

1324
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:04,954
Man:<I>
We Want The Chicken!

1325
01:06:04,987 --> 01:06:07,123
- Girl: <I>Oh, Man!
- Man: <I>Oh, Where Is He?

1326
01:06:07,157 --> 01:06:10,260
Man:<I>
Let's Cock-A-Doodle-Do It!

1327
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:13,097
- Cock-A-Doodle-Doo! Come On, Everybody.
- There's The Chicken.

1328
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:19,236
Kids, The Chicken
Is Back! Whoo!

1329
01:06:19,268 --> 01:06:23,640
- Oh, The Cops.
- Get The Chicken!

1330
01:06:23,674 --> 01:06:26,643
I Got Him, Uncle Lou.
Law Enforcement At Work Here, Folks.

1331
01:06:26,677 --> 01:06:28,278
- (Chicken Whimpering)
- Let Me See.

1332
01:06:28,311 --> 01:06:31,081
- Please, I--
- (Crowd Gasps)

1333
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:34,083
Wait A Minute.
This Isn't The Real Chicken.

1334
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,052
- It's A Fake.
- Sheriff: <I>We Got A Copycat Here.

1335
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:38,755
Everyone Stand Down.
Repeat, We Have A Copycat.

1336
01:06:38,788 --> 01:06:40,390
Sorry, Folks.
I Couldn't Resist.

1337
01:06:40,424 --> 01:06:42,092
I Just Wanted
Some Attention...

1338
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,761
- <I>(Handcuffs Clicking)
- <I>...And Love.

1339
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,195
- Come On.
- (Crying)

1340
01:06:48,931 --> 01:06:50,199
Janitors.

1341
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:52,169
Let's Go!
Huddle Up!

1342
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:56,072
Well, If There's No Chicken,
I'm Gonna Get On Home And Soak My Feet.

1343
01:06:56,105 --> 01:06:57,741
- Out Of My Way, Dill Pickle.
- Watch It.

1344
01:06:57,773 --> 01:07:00,009
Out Of My-- You--
(Grumbling)

1345
01:07:00,043 --> 01:07:03,047
- Man: <I>Come On, Let's Get Out Of Here!
- Come On! Where's Your Spirit?

1346
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:04,882
Woman: <I>Let's Go Find The Real Chicken!

1347
01:07:11,721 --> 01:07:13,223
- Poole.
- Tommy: <I>To Tip-Off We Go.

1348
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,459
<I>(Whistle Blows)

1349
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:18,996
(Buzzer Sounds)

1350
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:21,165
Whatever.

1351
01:07:22,132 --> 01:07:23,867
Come On, Let's Go.

1352
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:30,107
- (Whistle Blows)
- <I>(Buzzer Sounds)

1353
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:32,108
Frank: <I>Friday Night's Game Was The Biggest Crowd

1354
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:33,844
In Rooster
Basketball History.

1355
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:35,913
For The First
10 Minutes, Anyhow.

1356
01:07:35,945 --> 01:07:38,848
Seems To Me People Only Come To See The Chicken.

1357
01:07:38,882 --> 01:07:40,717
Hmmm, You Know,
I'm Pretty Sure

1358
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,853
People Go To Basketball Games To Watch Basketball.

1359
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:46,423
But Maybe You're Right, Maybe They Just
Want To See A Chicken Act Like A Fool.

1360
01:07:46,456 --> 01:07:48,258
It's Becoming
An Economic Issue, Coach.

1361
01:07:48,291 --> 01:07:51,161
- (Groans)
- There's Been A Substantial Increase In The Sale

1362
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:52,462
<I>Of Game Tickets.

1363
01:07:52,496 --> 01:07:54,831
Most Importantly,
The Town's Pride Quotient

1364
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:57,033
Has Increased
Significantly Friday Nights.

1365
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:58,402
Now It's A Simple Question:

1366
01:07:58,434 --> 01:08:00,503
How Can We Get
The Chicken To Come Back?

1367
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:02,939
Well, I Suspect
One Thing On His Mind

1368
01:08:02,973 --> 01:08:04,741
Is The Little Matter
Of The Sheriff's Car.

1369
01:08:04,775 --> 01:08:06,777
Well, I Spoke To Lou And He's
Willing To Drop All Charges.

1370
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:10,246
What? That's Not Fair,
He Stole The Sheriff's Car!

1371
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:12,181
Come On, Corky,

1372
01:08:12,215 --> 01:08:14,017
Who Here Among Us
Has Never Stolen

1373
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:16,520
A Sheriff's Car
When We Were Young?

1374
01:08:16,553 --> 01:08:18,122
Huh?

1375
01:08:18,155 --> 01:08:20,257
Anyhow, The Chicken--

1376
01:08:20,289 --> 01:08:22,225
Let's Not Forget
The Reason He Stole The Car

1377
01:08:22,258 --> 01:08:26,096
In The First Place Was To Prevent
Himself From Being Unmasked.

1378
01:08:26,129 --> 01:08:27,998
We Need To Convince
That Chicken

1379
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,267
That If He Shows Up Again,
He Won't Be Touched.

1380
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:32,268
Well, How Are We
Gonna Do That?

1381
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:33,804
Ah.

1382
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:44,915
(Feedback)

1383
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,254
So Our Objective
Is To Get The Chicken Back.

1384
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:56,492
We're Certain That He Is Here
Among You At This Very Moment.

1385
01:08:56,526 --> 01:08:59,062
Whoever You Are,
We Want To Assure You

1386
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:02,298
That All Vehicular Theft
Charges Have Been Dropped

1387
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:05,169
<I>And That No One
Will Expose You.

1388
01:09:05,201 --> 01:09:09,071
Whoever Even Tries,
Will Be Given Double Permanent Suspension.

1389
01:09:09,105 --> 01:09:12,276
And Endure
Eternal Misfortune

1390
01:09:12,308 --> 01:09:15,146
Which I Will
Personally Inflict!

1391
01:09:21,418 --> 01:09:23,387
Coach Mackey
Speaks For All Of Us.

1392
01:09:23,419 --> 01:09:25,188
We Need You Back, Chicken.

1393
01:09:26,356 --> 01:09:28,258
Come Back,
You Big Chicken!

1394
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,992
<I>We Love You!

1395
01:09:30,026 --> 01:09:32,496
And We Need You.

1396
01:09:38,034 --> 01:09:39,937
(Cheering)

1397
01:09:44,007 --> 01:09:45,942
I Can't Believe
I'm Actually Doing This.

1398
01:09:45,976 --> 01:09:47,311
I Can't Believe
He's Actually Doing This.

1399
01:09:47,343 --> 01:09:50,146
<I>(School Bell Rings)

1400
01:09:56,486 --> 01:09:59,990
It Can't Be Keith Burke.
He's Too Short To Be The Chicken.

1401
01:10:00,022 --> 01:10:03,159
- What About Bobby Nevin?
You Never See Him At Games. - Oh, Yes.

1402
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:05,128
Hey, Pete.
How's It Going?

1403
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,129
Good. Good.

1404
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:08,999
What Are You Guys Doing?

1405
01:10:09,031 --> 01:10:12,502
Oh, Just What Everyone
Else In School's Doing.

1406
01:10:12,535 --> 01:10:14,571
Trying To Figure Out
Who The Chicken Really Is.

1407
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:17,139
- Oh.
- Hey! Maybe It's This

1408
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:19,610
Pete Ivey Guy,
Whoever He Is.

1409
01:10:19,642 --> 01:10:22,511
Camie: <I>No Way Is Pete Ivey The Chicken.

1410
01:10:22,544 --> 01:10:24,882
<I>Pete Ivey
Is Not Smart Enough,

1411
01:10:24,914 --> 01:10:26,349
And Pete Ivey
Is Not Cool Enough

1412
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:28,184
And Pete Ivey
Is Not Wild Enough.

1413
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:31,021
- I'm Standing Right Here.
- Yeah.

1414
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:33,289
Angela, Who Do
You Think It Is?

1415
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:35,424
Uh, I Have No Idea.

1416
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:37,160
Maybe Keith Burke?

1417
01:10:37,192 --> 01:10:41,130
He Seems Like He Could
I Guess.Kind Of Guy,

1418
01:10:41,164 --> 01:10:44,300
That's What I Thought!
It's Totally The Burkester.

1419
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:46,036
Mm-Hmm.

1420
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,405
- Bye, Pete.
- Bye.

1421
01:10:54,343 --> 01:10:56,179
(Police Radio Chatter)

1422
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:04,922
Boy, I Hope
The Chicken Shows Up.

1423
01:11:04,955 --> 01:11:07,691
Oh, Lou,
You Mind Leaving The Handcuffs In The Cruiser?

1424
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:10,293
Fred, I Will Not Arrest
The Chicken

1425
01:11:10,326 --> 01:11:11,995
Should He Choose
To Return.

1426
01:11:13,596 --> 01:11:15,598
(Grunts)

1427
01:11:15,632 --> 01:11:18,067
We've Been
Stood Up Again.

1428
01:11:18,101 --> 01:11:20,437
I Am Tired Of Looking
Like A Fool.

1429
01:11:20,469 --> 01:11:22,505
- Where's That Chicken That's Supposed To Be--
- Ow!

1430
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,675
<I>"Oh, The Chicken'll
Be Here, You Just Wait."

1431
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,945
Yeah, We Need The Chicken.

1432
01:11:27,977 --> 01:11:29,679
(Crowd Shouting)

1433
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:34,383
- Oh, Boy.
- (Buzzer Sounds)

1434
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:38,254
Why? Why? Why?

1435
01:11:38,288 --> 01:11:41,258
- Oh, Why?
- <I>(Whistle Blows)

1436
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:43,559
(Crying)
Stu-- Stupid Chicken!

1437
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:46,629
<I>(Buzzer Sounds)

1438
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,369
Pete:<I>
What Is That, Suze?

1439
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:54,570
We're Gonna Use This Tonight
To Signal The Chicken.

1440
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:56,205
It's Not Our Best Idea,
But We're Desperate.

1441
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,407
Suze, How's My
Rooster Signal?

1442
01:11:58,441 --> 01:12:02,045
Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy.

1443
01:12:02,078 --> 01:12:03,614
Best Idea I Ever Had.

1444
01:12:06,415 --> 01:12:08,284
Good Luck.

1445
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:10,553
Personally, I Think The Chicken Has A Better Chance

1446
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,423
Of Seeing That Than This.

1447
01:12:13,623 --> 01:12:15,291
What Is This?

1448
01:12:15,325 --> 01:12:17,694
Didn't You Hear?
Tommy's Challenging The Chicken

1449
01:12:17,727 --> 01:12:19,296
To Come On
"Rooster Talk" Today

1450
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:21,130
And Explain Why
He's Called It Quits.

1451
01:12:25,668 --> 01:12:27,237
Hi, I'm Tommy Thompson

1452
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:30,139
And We Have A Very Special
Guest On "Rooster Talk" Today.

1453
01:12:30,173 --> 01:12:33,242
The Pride Of Brewster--
The Chicken.

1454
01:12:33,276 --> 01:12:35,312
(Cheering)

1455
01:12:37,147 --> 01:12:39,616
(Giggling)

1456
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:40,816
(Electronic Voice)
Hello, Tommy.

1457
01:12:40,849 --> 01:12:43,486
Yes, The Chicken's Voice
Has Been Electronically Altered

1458
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,388
To Protect
His Identity.

1459
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:47,290
Chicken,
Let's Get Right To It.

1460
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:48,758
Why Have You Decided
To Hang It Up?

1461
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:51,794
Well, Tommy, Because
Under These Feathers,

1462
01:12:51,828 --> 01:12:54,196
I'm Not Really
Mascot Material,

1463
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:55,732
Just An Average Guy.

1464
01:12:55,764 --> 01:12:58,602
- I Love You, Chicken!
- (All Laughing)

1465
01:12:58,634 --> 01:13:00,803
I Think That Proves
You're Anything But Average.

1466
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:04,040
- <I>You're The Sparkplug Of Our School.
- (Clucks)

1467
01:13:04,074 --> 01:13:05,575
You're The Spirit
Of The Whole Town.

1468
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:07,410
That's A Lot
To Live Up To.

1469
01:13:07,444 --> 01:13:09,812
Well, Seeing How As How The
Roosters' Last Remaining Game

1470
01:13:09,846 --> 01:13:11,214
Is Against
The Mountain Lions,

1471
01:13:11,246 --> 01:13:13,383
Number One
In The League,

1472
01:13:13,415 --> 01:13:16,253
<I>It's Going To Be Tough To Avoid A
Shutout Season Without The Chicken.

1473
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:17,587
I Think They
Can Do It! Right?

1474
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,156
Let's Bring Out
Someone Who Believes

1475
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:21,258
They Can't Win
Without You.

1476
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:23,259
Coach Mackey!

1477
01:13:23,293 --> 01:13:24,728
- (Cheering)
- Boy: Yeah, Coach!

1478
01:13:31,267 --> 01:13:32,502
Coach, You Think
You Can't Win

1479
01:13:32,535 --> 01:13:34,137
- Without The Chicken?
- Bawk.

1480
01:13:34,169 --> 01:13:36,205
I Am Positive We Can't
Win Without The Chicken.

1481
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,473
- Bawk?
- I Love The Show, By The Way.

1482
01:13:37,507 --> 01:13:39,843
I'm A Big Fan.
If I Can Get A Picture With You Afterwards,

1483
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,677
- That Be Kinda-- Kinda--
- (Clucking)

1484
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:43,646
Ah.

1485
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,147
- Chicken?
- Bawk?

1486
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:46,650
Just Hear Me Out, Okay?

1487
01:13:46,682 --> 01:13:50,252
Look, If You Come Back,
I Promise...

1488
01:13:50,285 --> 01:13:52,321
I Won't Throw My Clipboard
At You Anymore.

1489
01:13:52,355 --> 01:13:55,692
And-- And-- You Can Break Through
The Big Paper Sign Before The Game.

1490
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:58,128
- (Clucking)
- Huh? What Do You Say?

1491
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,562
Give Me A Wing?

1492
01:13:59,596 --> 01:14:02,432
- (Clucking)
- Oh, Come Here, You Big Lug.

1493
01:14:02,464 --> 01:14:04,200
All: Awww!

1494
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:08,771
<I>(Applauding)

1495
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:11,708
- (Blubbering)
- Bawk?

1496
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:15,211
So I Guess This Means The Chicken
Will Be At The Big Game Friday?

1497
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:19,316
I'll Be At The Game,

1498
01:14:19,348 --> 01:14:21,117
But I'll Be In The Stands
With All The Other Students.

1499
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:24,321
(Crowd Groans)

1500
01:14:24,353 --> 01:14:27,590
Tommy: <I>Well,
If This Is Gone For Good For The Chicken...

1501
01:14:27,624 --> 01:14:30,494
<I>Can We At Least Know
Who The Man Is

1502
01:14:30,526 --> 01:14:32,626
<I>Behind The Chicken Suit?

1503
01:14:32,794 --> 01:14:34,897
Let Me Answer That
With Another Question.

1504
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:37,601
Why Doesn't The Lone Ranger
Take Off His Mask?

1505
01:14:38,601 --> 01:14:40,504
I Give Up. Why?

1506
01:14:40,536 --> 01:14:43,339
'Cause The Magic's
In The Mystery.

1507
01:14:43,373 --> 01:14:46,343
Once You Know,
The Mystery's Over,

1508
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:48,478
<I>And So Is The Magic.

1509
01:14:55,884 --> 01:14:58,320
Pete, Dude,
We're Back In Business.

1510
01:14:58,353 --> 01:15:01,191
And Check It Out.
I Even Got The Suit Dry-Cleaned.

1511
01:15:01,223 --> 01:15:03,659
- Great.
- Dude, The Chicken's Risen From The Ashes.

1512
01:15:03,692 --> 01:15:05,427
You Know,
Kinda Like The Phoenix.

1513
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,164
They're Both Birds, Right?

1514
01:15:07,196 --> 01:15:09,331
<I>I Thought We Agreed
We Were Done With That.

1515
01:15:09,365 --> 01:15:11,401
But Pete,
The Chicken's Off The Hook.

1516
01:15:11,433 --> 01:15:13,235
You Heard
What The Coach Said.

1517
01:15:13,268 --> 01:15:15,204
He Said If You Show Up At The Game,
They Won't Arrest You.

1518
01:15:15,237 --> 01:15:17,339
I Mean, What A Beautiful
Country We Live In

1519
01:15:17,373 --> 01:15:18,741
When A Chicken Can
Steal A Sheriff's Car

1520
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:20,643
And Run Scot-Free--
I Mean, I'm Just Saying,

1521
01:15:20,677 --> 01:15:22,512
God Bless America.

1522
01:15:22,544 --> 01:15:24,413
No, Poole,
You Were Right Before.

1523
01:15:24,446 --> 01:15:26,215
You Know, We Should
Just Let This All Die

1524
01:15:26,249 --> 01:15:27,918
And We Can Have A Good Laugh
About It In 30 Years.

1525
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,319
But, Pete, You Said That
You Wanted People To Know

1526
01:15:30,352 --> 01:15:33,355
That You Were The Chicken. I Mean,
You Tried To Tell Everybody At The Rally.

1527
01:15:33,388 --> 01:15:35,324
- You Were Ready Then.
- I'm Not Ready Now.

1528
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,561
Maybe I'm Never Gonna Be
Ready For People To Know

1529
01:15:38,594 --> 01:15:40,329
It Was Just Boring Old
Pete Ivey In The Suit.

1530
01:15:40,362 --> 01:15:42,199
What Are You
Talking About?

1531
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:43,632
You're Gonna
Be Famous, Man.

1532
01:15:43,665 --> 01:15:46,203
- People Are Gonna Love You.
- Yeah, But What If They Don't?

1533
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:47,504
Poole, What If People
Stop Liking The Chicken

1534
01:15:47,536 --> 01:15:49,239
Because They
Knew It Was Me?

1535
01:15:49,272 --> 01:15:52,509
Pete, If That's Seriously
What You're Worried About,

1536
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,277
Then You Need To
Look At It Like This, Man:

1537
01:15:55,311 --> 01:15:56,914
You Can Live Your
Whole Life In A Shell...

1538
01:15:58,447 --> 01:16:01,584
Or You Can Hatch.

1539
01:16:03,319 --> 01:16:05,388
<I>No Guts, No Glory.

1540
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:09,392
Eh, Glory's
Overrated Anyhow.

1541
01:16:09,424 --> 01:16:11,561
Whoa.

1542
01:16:11,593 --> 01:16:14,263
I Hope You Know
What You're Doing, Man.

1543
01:16:14,297 --> 01:16:16,333
'Cause You're Letting
A Whole Lot Of People Down.

1544
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:33,951
This Is Your Fault.

1545
01:16:35,317 --> 01:16:39,355
<I>(Team Clucking,
Squawking)

1546
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,730
All Right!

1547
01:16:46,763 --> 01:16:49,599
Do You Little Chicklets Believe
You Can Beat Those Lions?!

1548
01:16:49,632 --> 01:16:50,800
Not Without The Chicken, No.

1549
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:53,837
What?

1550
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:56,339
I'm Being Honest.
Even Coach Said It On Tv.

1551
01:16:56,371 --> 01:16:57,641
Okay Okay. Okay.

1552
01:16:57,673 --> 01:16:59,441
I'm Saying We Can.

1553
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:01,343
And There Are 500
Rooster Fans Out There

1554
01:17:01,377 --> 01:17:03,280
Who Believe You Can Win
Without The Dang Chicken!

1555
01:17:03,312 --> 01:17:06,482
They're All Just Gonna Leave As Soon
As The Chicken Doesn't Show Up.

1556
01:17:06,516 --> 01:17:09,686
So What? Maybe They Will,
But This Is Our Last Game, Men!

1557
01:17:09,718 --> 01:17:11,320
Do You Want To Go Through
Life With The Honor

1558
01:17:11,353 --> 01:17:13,490
Of Being The Only
Winless Team In 46 Years?!

1559
01:17:13,522 --> 01:17:16,860
- No, Sir!
- Is It True We Haven't Won One Single Game?

1560
01:17:16,892 --> 01:17:18,194
It Is Absolutely True!

1561
01:17:18,227 --> 01:17:20,996
- Now Do You Believe We Can Beat Them Lions?!
- All: Maybe!

1562
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:23,633
- I'll Take It! Now Let's Go
- <I>(Marching Band Playing)

1563
01:17:23,665 --> 01:17:25,968
Crashing Through That
Sign Like Raging Roosters

1564
01:17:26,002 --> 01:17:27,337
- And Show 'Em Who We Are!
- (All Shouting)

1565
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,040
Actually, You Know What?
We Should Probably Not Go Through The Sign...

1566
01:17:30,072 --> 01:17:33,375
In Case The Chicken Shows Up.
I Sort Of Promised It To Him.

1567
01:17:33,409 --> 01:17:35,011
(Squawking)

1568
01:17:35,044 --> 01:17:37,381

01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:52,728
Cheerleaders:
Whoo!

1571
01:17:52,762 --> 01:17:54,964
It's The Final Game Of The Year
Here In The Big Chicken Coop.

1572
01:17:54,996 --> 01:17:56,633
Our Very Own
Raging Roosters

1573
01:17:56,665 --> 01:17:59,069
Will Try To Score Their First
Victory Of The Season

1574
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:03,106
Against The Undefeated
25 And 0 Mountain Lions!

1575
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,874
Can They Do It?
Can They Do It?

1576
01:18:05,907 --> 01:18:07,910
Our Fans Think
They Can Do It.

1577
01:18:07,944 --> 01:18:10,580
<I>So Let's Do It.

1578

1584
01:18:33,069 --> 01:18:36,138
Well, It's Been
An Interesting Season.

1585
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:38,942
- Can't Win 'Em All.
- Can't Win One, Actually.

1586
01:18:38,974 --> 01:18:41,511
<I>(Whistle Blows)

1587
01:18:41,544 --> 01:18:44,081
Come On, Pete.
Where Are You?
