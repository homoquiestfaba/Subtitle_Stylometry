LUCY: Food is more
than just fuel.

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:42,216
It's sharing, it's conversation,
it's hello and goodbye.

5
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,610
It's giving and receiving.

6
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,090
It's a prayer.

7
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,399
It's what we dream of
and everything we fear.

8
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:54,010
Food is where we come
from and it's what

9
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,621
we'll all eventually become.

10
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:58,928
But too much food creates waste.

11
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,062
Waste is destroying our world.

12
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,369
Environmentalists agree
thatdisposable plastic cutlery

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,850
is the single greatest
threat to our planet.

14
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,162
I'm Lucy Vanderton,
and I created.

15

Incredible Edible
Cutlery to bring

16
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,340
an end to that destruction.

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,995
We all know you can'teat
food without cutlery.

18
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:26,608
But now, you can eat
cutlery without food.

19
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:30,699

in a white male-dominatedworld,
we reflect that future,

22
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,191

disposable plastic cutlery

23
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:48,282

00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,467
Well, I think it's inspiring.

27
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:00,966
You're positive and
you're uplifting.

28
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,905
And naive and stupid.

29
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,995
And... and please, that
family was fake as fuck.

30
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,170
OK, yeah.

31
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,432
I'll redo it.

32

Listen, do you
remember the first thing

33
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,568
I said to you at Tufts?

34
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:17,833
That I saw a beautiful,
intelligent black woman

35
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:23,143
who has the potential tobe
the Beyonce of business.

36
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:25,928
That's why I agreed
to mentor you.

37
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:29,714
I want that person back, Jess.

38
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:33,936

inside you, girlfriend.

54
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,896
It's too heavy.

55
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,593
We can't move this.

56
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,987
If we all push it together,
do you think maybe we can?

57
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,554
How do we get it on the podium?

58
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:28,077
Excuse me, sir.

59
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,471
Are we allowed to put
the podium on its side.

60
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:31,950
I can't tell you how to do it.

61
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,343
That'd be cheating, right?

62
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:34,953
Hey, we're not trying to cheat.

63
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,434
We just want to clarifywhat
we can and cannot do.

64
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,306
Come on, people.

65
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:40,611
Figure it out.

66
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,614
Think team.

67
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,312
Aidan, go lay
down in front of it.

68
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,704
We'll use you as a ramp.

69
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:47,705
That's fine with me, I guess.

70
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:48,358
Wait.

71
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,054
Hey, stop.

72
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:49,925
Don't lay down.

73
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:50,839
He's fucking with you.

74
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,406
Oh.

75
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:53,536
You almost got me there.

76
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,235
OK.

77
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,430
What we need to do is usethese
two poles as a railroad

78
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,717
so we can roll the
ballthingy up unto the thing.

79
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,241
OK, yeah.

80
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:04,287
And then use the ropes
as a pulley system

81
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,202
to get the ball on
top of the rails.

82
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,943
This is not fun at all.

83
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,466
It's not supposed to be fun.

84
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:10,641
OK, well it's working.

85
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:12,034
It's not moving.

86
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,164

87
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:13,992
Wait.

88
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:14,950
Use a pole as a lever.

89
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,517
Yeah, that's a good idea.

90
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:17,779
But we only have two poles.

91
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,607
Right.

92
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:21,280
And we need both the poles
tomake the actual train tracks.

93
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,890
Jess, let's just forgetabout
the railroad tracks, OK?

94

Let's just focus on movingthe
ball toward the podium.

it up when we get there.

We have to try
and move it somehow.

Have you got another
pole, like a metal one?

I want to say
that I'm mad, but I

109

am severely disappointed
in every one of you,

110

I'm sorry.

a hard time, huh?

It comes with the territory.

the punching bag.

I was the hate sponge for
theyears until you came along.

127
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,964
My advice is, soak it in.

128
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,836
And if you ever
get any feelings,

129
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:45,796
just push them down with
booze and video games.

soon, very soon.

but very soon, I'm

136

going to be taking on the
brandnew role of vice president,

137

a brand new hate sponge,

I can't recommend more
strongly that this group

169
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,487
takes the beginner route.

170
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,227

cave system that's

171
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:11,012
for experienced spelunkers.

theadvanced route of the deepest

173

New Mexico, then we

174

can navigate the challenges
oftoday's business environment.

The only way for
a muscle to grow

176

is to have something
to push against,

177
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,510
and we all know that
thebiggest muscle in the body

178
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,380
is the brain.

00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,213
Come on!

184
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,087
Well, checks cleared.

185
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,873
You guys signed your releases.

186
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:49,616
Let's go bone some stone.

187
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:50,834
Rappelling.

188
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,285
SUZY: We're
rappelling down there?

189
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,534
Well, look, you
are all more than

190
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,798
welcome to opt out and havea
lovely time by yourself

191
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,974
on the bus thinking
about the new direction

192
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,168
your career might be going.

193
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,280
All right, everybody.

194
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,021
Listen up.

195
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,458
Now, the number one rule
thatyou must follow at all times

196
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,461
is do whatever the fuck
Isay the second I say it.

197
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,202
That's probably the
most important thing.

198
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,596
Now, on top of that,
I'm goingto go over a couple of dos

199
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,207
and do not dos.

200
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:21,604
Do keep your helmet on
your head at all times.

201
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:25,260
Do not consume alcohol
or illegal drugs

202
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,088
before entering the cave.

203
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,742
Do be vigilant.

204
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:32,441
Keep your eyes peeled
for spiders, scorpions,

205
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,139
or poisonous snakes,
because they are abundant,

206
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,359
and they are trying to
kill you at all times.

207
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,057
Now, if we're lucky,
we mayencounter some cave paintings.

208
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:43,234
These are from the AcamaTribe
of first Americans.

209
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,497
Do not touch the cave paintings.

210
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:50,328
And always remember,
they were here first.

211
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,113
Lucy, what have you got?

212
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:56,247
I am actually 1/64
Acama, so if any of you

213
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,641
want to touch or
examine the paintings,

214
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,556
then just clear
it with me first.

215
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,602
I'll be assuming the
role of tribal elder

216
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:06,083
for the duration of the trip.

217
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,476
Cool.

218
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,651
Let's do this.

219
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,218
SUZY: There's really no stairs?

220
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,915
BRANDON: Where do you
want the stair on?

221
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,613
AIDAN: Hey, guys.

222
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,092
I think I'm stuck.

223
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,679
Just for the record,
I'm definitely getting

224
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,810
the vice president position.

225
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,140
OK.

226
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,944
Well, for the record,
Lucy and I have already

227
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,510
discussed my new role as
vicepresident in great detail

228
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,189
for the last two
months, so... OK.

229
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,254
Well, I've been at the
companyway longer than you, OK?

230
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,758
Why would Lucy
promote you over me?

231
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:29,367
Three words.

232
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,586
OK.

233
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,109
Master of Business
Administration.

234
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,546
That's four words, including of.

235
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,288
Isn't counting... correct
me if I'm wrong...

236
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,681
A valuable business skill?

237
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,398
Yeah, it is, but of
doesn't count as a word.

238
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,728
It's like the.

239
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:42,966
Nobody gives a shit
about those two words.

240
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,208
I can't do this.

241
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,167
I really can't do this, Lucy.

242
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:47,559
You can do this.

243
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,170
I know what you're capable of.

244
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,523
Look, are you a woman
who runs with wolves?

245
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,177
Are you?

246
00:10:56,307 --> 00:11:00,442
I think I'm more the womanwho
runs away from wolves,

247
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,985
because they can smell
my fear.- Not anymore.

248
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:02,705
Not anymore.

249
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:03,445
They get off on it.

250
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,315
I'm going to die.

251
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,274
Look, I believe in you.

252
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,404
Why?

253
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:09,103
So you have to believe in you.

254
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,081
Otherwise, you're saying
I'mwrong about who I believe in,

255
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,778
and... and I don't thinkyou're
saying that, are you?

256
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,021
Not intentionally.

257
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,370
, No no.

258
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,502
You're still on
the edible cutlery,

259
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:21,506
whereas I'm all over thebrand-new
exciting project, OK?

260
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,986
What does that tell you?

261
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:24,703
I wouldn't exactlycall Vanderton University

262
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,337
a brand-new exciting project.

263
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,315
We've actually rebranded as
the Vanderton Wealth institute,

264
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,577
but you wouldn't know
that, because you

265
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,777
weren't in the meetings.

266
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,102
Yeah, because those
meetings are dumb,

267
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,954
and it's just busy work for you.

268
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,084
We get free coffee.

269
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,697
You see that there?

270
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,747
Hey, quick question.

271
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:47,358
I got a call from my
transport team on Friday

272
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,013
and they said that our
quarterly check bounced.

273
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,623
That's weird.

274
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:52,581
Did you call Medfirst?

275
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,757
Yeah, I did.

276
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:57,064
Tanner said that
we're overdrawn.

277
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:59,762
That shouldn't be happening.

278
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:00,632
I'll look into it.

279
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,763
OK.

280
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:07,074
You know, if running
the accounts department

281
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:10,730
is getting to be too much for
you, you can just let me know.

282
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,253
I'm fine.

283
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,863
OK.

284
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:17,954
Well, if not, you can
always talk to me.

285
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:21,175
I'm available during
business hours.

286
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,305
Thanks.

287
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,655
That's very generous of you.

288
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,309
DEREK: I think I felt some rain.

289
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,591
Oh, that's pretty scary, huh?

290
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,225
You don't want to
piss your pants.

291
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,855
I don't think the girls downhere
would like that very much.

292
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,879
Hey, come on, man.

293
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,447
Don't go ragging on the intern.

294
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:35,015
Aidan pissed his
pants one single time.

295
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:36,585
Surely you should
be able to move on.

296
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:37,800
Great banter, guys.

297
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,106
You're making me laugh.

298
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,890
I don't think I can.

299
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:41,586
Please.

300
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,023
Yes, you can.

301
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:43,980
Brandon!

302
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,547
And now is the time, OK?

303
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,332
You just need to nut upand
put that pussy into it.

304
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:49,463
Now, follow my lead.

305
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:53,946
You.

306
00:12:57,864 --> 00:12:59,213
Woo!

307
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,737
GLORIA: Our insurance
does not cover this.

308
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:02,564
BRANDON: Lamps on.

309
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:03,391
FREDDIE: Lights on?

310
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,392
Oh my god.

311
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:05,785
LUCY: Get your light on.

312
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,660
(GRUNTING)

313
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:16,447
What's happening?

314
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,583
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

315
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:22,758
LUCY: No, you're not.

316
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:23,585
Yes, I am.

317
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,021
No, you're not.

318
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,458
Your panic attack
is not authorized.

319
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,984
I can't be doing this.

320
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,507
I hate it.

321
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:33,987
Lucy, I hate it.

322
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,336
BRANDON: That a girl.

323
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:37,555
Keep pumping those elbows.

324
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,296
I think my fricking
knee's dinged up.

325
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,125
BRANDON: No pressure,
butmaybe hurry up a little.

326
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:42,909
LUCY: It's all right.

327
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,127
Keep going.

328
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,658
BRANDON: Looking
good, looking good.

329
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,652
LUCY: Less than six feet.

330
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,567
BRANDON: Yeah, you got this.

331
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,091
SUZY: I'm so scared.

332
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,381
BRANDON: Yeah, but look cute.

333
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Don't worry about it.

334
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,836
LUCY: There you go.

335
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:57,532
BRANDON: All right.

336
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:58,402
That a girl.

337
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,533
Good job, good job.

338
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,621
All right.

339
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:01,947
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

340
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,625
I guess I'm alive.

341
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:06,846
Exactly, and you probably
feelmore alive than you ever have,

342
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:07,411
right?

343
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,848
Uh-huh.

344
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,024
Yeah, you do.

345
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:11,676
You did it.

346
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:12,852
Guys, come on.

347
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:13,722
We made it.

348
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,507
We made it as a team.

349
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,640
Teamwork makes the
dream work, right?

350
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,850
Makes the dream work, yeah.

351
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:20,772
Come on.

352
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:21,991
(CHEERING)

353
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,820
All right, listen up.

354
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,145
I'm going to ask
you to do something.

355
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,867
This might sound
a little far out,

356
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,564
but just go with me, all right?

357
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,088
Turn your head lamps off.

358
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,569
(SNAPPING)

359
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,009
(GASPS)

360
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,489
Oh my god.

361
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,100
Oh, oh my god.

362
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:46,189
That never gets old.

363
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,973
LUCY: Glorious.

364
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,365
Wow.

365
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,889
BRANDON: Pretty
spectacular, right?

366
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:50,498
GLORIA: Incredible.

367
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,716
Yeah, good.

368
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:52,717
OK.

369
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,676
Welcome to Cathedral Cavern.

370
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,166
This is pretty much
the crown jewel

371
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,245
of this entire cave system.

372
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,335
The great state of New Mexicowas
kind enough to rig it up

373
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,032
with some auxiliary
battery lighting

374
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:06,209
so you can really
feel the full effect.

375
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Spectacular.

376
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,777
(SNIFFING)

377
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,908
Namaste.

378
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:16,393
Feel free to explore,
lookaround, enjoy yourselves.

379
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:20,615
I'll be sitting over
there eating a Clementine.

380
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:23,357
Hey, guys, it's
an Acoma painting.

381
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,098
It's Acama.

382
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:25,881
Acama?

383
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,057
(HUMMING)

384
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:29,189
So you can read all this?

385
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,407
LUCY: Yeah, somewhat.

386
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,104
Hey.

387
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:32,540
OK.

388
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,759
So I guess she offered
us both the position.

389
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,806
She's playing us by danglingthe
same carrot, a carrot

390
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
the both of us can't eat.

391
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:43,029
It's manipulative, it's
petty, it's deceitful,

392
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,335
it's disrespectful.

393
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:46,728
It's a classic Lucy.

394
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,401
I guess she has to
keep us hungry to keep

395
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,123
the company afloat.

396
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:51,951
Wait, what do you mean afloat?

397
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,909
Shit.

398
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,651
OK, keep this on the DL, OK?

399
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,781
Down low.

400
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,219
Yeah, I know what that is.

401
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:00,176
Don't let it come up to the
surface, down low.

402
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:01,134
I understand what that is.

403
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,744
OK.

404
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,504
Vanderton University
hasbeen a complete disaster.

405
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,088
It's been hemorrhaging
money for months.

406
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,247
I keep telling her to shutit
down to save the company,

407
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,316
but she won't listen.

408
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:10,273
Look at this.

409
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,709
Put your hand right there.

410
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,580
Are you sure it's not
a curse or something?

411
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,320
Yes, yes.

412
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:13,929
No.

413
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,669
Look.

414
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,583
Feel that.

415
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,063
Oh.

416
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,803
Dammit.

417
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:19,955
I guess it's hard to sell
abusiness based on a personality

418
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,983
when it's your personality.

419
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,594
Oh, yeah, because she sucks.

420
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:27,769
Yeah, big time.

421
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,206
(QUAKING)

422
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:34,297
(SHOUTING)

423
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,654
What the fuck just happened?

424
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,178
That was a geologic incident.

425
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,308
What?

426
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:49,182
Yeah, a little tectonic tremor.

427
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:52,141
In English.

428
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,055
Earthquake?

429
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,317
Oh my god.

430
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,536
So what... what do we do?

431
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,408
(MUSIC PLAYING)

432
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,368
(THUD)

433
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:02,804
(SCREAMING)

434
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,197
LUCY: Oh, shit.

435
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,206
(SCREAMING)

436
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:14,772
Shouldn't you go
last, not first?

437
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,533
Yeah, but no,
because I should really go first check

438
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,819
the tunnel integrity, right?

439
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:18,689
Wait, wait, wait.

440
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,648
You can't leave us here!

441
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,084
See, it's so narrow.

442
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,564
I can't turn around
at this point.

443
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:24,845
You don't need to turn around.

444
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,349
Just crawl back.

445
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,525
It's probably best
foreverybody if I just get out,

446
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:29,656
you know?

447
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:30,353
See you guys on the other side.

448
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,876
No.

449
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:32,834
(QUAKING)

450
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:34,792
(SHOUTING)

451
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:35,923
Shit.

452
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,537
You know what?

453
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,277
I'm going to back out.

454
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:42,974
Get out.

455
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:43,758
BILLY: Yeah, come on, man.
BRANDON: It's the best thing.

456
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:45,629
I'm just going to... (CLATTERING)

457
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,458
(SCREAMING)

458
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,026
(BOOM)

459
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:59,382
Brandon?

460
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,513
Are you OK?

461
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,172
You all right, Brandon?

462
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:11,437
Brandon?

463
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,748
OK, he's not breathing.

464
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,054
Oh, god.

465
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,055
Oh, Jesus.

466
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,753
Hey, hey, I'm CPR trained.

467
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:28,759
Yep, he's dead.

468
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,763
Oh my god.

469
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,200
No, no, no.

470
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,681
No.

471
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,422
Does anyone's phone work?

472
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,688
There's no service.

473
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,084
All right, we got
to get out of here.

474
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,607
Look at the cracks.

475
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:51,976
There's something in the cracks.

476
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,456
Maybe you could
still make it through.

477
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,221
(GRUNTING)

478
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:56,222
It's rocks.

479
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,701
You can't dig through that.

480
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,834
There's probably anetwork of Acama tunnels.

481
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:01,681
I mean, that... that'ssomething
that we would do.

482
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:04,447
Maybe there's a
door, like a cave door.

483
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:08,669
There's a tunnel.

484
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,801
Yeah, but it's
going the wrong way.

485
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,804
A tunnel going down isbetter
than no tunnel at all.

486
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,066
Right, guys?

487
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,765
No.

488
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:18,766
We're fucked.

489
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:22,204
There's nothing.

490
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:25,207
We are so totally,
totally fucked.

491
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,948
Help!

492
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,124
Hey, hey, hey, oh, oh.

493
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,256
(SCREAMING)

494
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,387
(THUDS)

495
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:32,301
Hey, hey.

496
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:33,259
Help!

497
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,521
Stop it.

498
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:35,802
You're going to cause
another cave-in.

499
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,567
Everything always happens to me.

500
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,398
We're trapped.

501
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,487
We're all going
to die down here.

502
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:47,664
We are going to die, huh?

503
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:49,492
Billy.

504
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:52,582
We are all trapped and we
aregoing to fucking die down here.

505
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:53,192
Billy.

506
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:53,801
(SLAPS)

507
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,151
Oh.

508
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:56,934
Ow.

509
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,589
Advanced.

510
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,896
Why do you just say we had
to do the fucking advanced?

511
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:05,160
(THUD)

512
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,685
There's nothing.

513
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:09,816
There's no way out.

514
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:17,041
At least our families won'thave
to pay for our funerals,

515
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:20,262
seeing how we've already
been buried alive.

516
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,090
OK, people.

517
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,615
I think that the situationis under control.

518
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,400
How'd do you work that out?

519
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,490
It's only a matter ofhours
before we get rescued.

520
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,883
I mean, I personally
put in the caving permit

521
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,538
with a completeitinerary in that dropbox

522
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,237
at the ranger station.

523
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,283
So let's just relax,
enjoy the adventure.

524
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:45,244
It's a perfectteam-building opportunity.

525
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,464
It's like our own
private escape room.

526
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:51,467
We do need to make
the most of our space,

527
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:55,863
so this area should be
thedesignated toilet zone.

528
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,605
And I'm thinking that
this area over here

529
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,869
should be our private zone
forpersonal reflection, you know?

530
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,959
Much like the interfaith
area at the airport.

531
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:08,745
Most importantly,
we need tomanage our resources carefully.

532
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,748
I've done a complete
inventoryof our food supplies,

533
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:15,752
and it consists of a
samplebox of Edible Cutlery

534
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:19,321
that Aidan brought with him.

535
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:21,845
You brought a box
of product samples?

536
00:21:21,976 --> 00:21:23,107
Yeah.

537
00:21:23,238 --> 00:21:24,433
I always keep a
set in my backpack.

538
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:25,564
You never know
when you might need

539
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:26,850
some cutlery that you can eat.

540
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:30,114
Aidan's dedication
to the flagship product

541
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,900
should be seen as
aninspiration and a life-saving

542
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,164
example to us all.

543
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,948
Aidan.

544
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,254
Yeah.

545
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,038
If you don't have
gum for all of us,

546
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,475

This is private property.

Why should I be penalized
justbecause I'm the only one who

556

properly prepared?

This excursion is fully fundedby
Incredible Edible Cutlery,

558
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,498
so all of the equipment,
including your CamelBak,

559
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:06,628
is company property.

560
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:07,891
Oh, no, it's not.

561
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,851
Just hand over the
goddamn CamelBak.

562
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:14,289
This is bullshit.

563
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,900
OK, please pass
these potato forks.

564
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,599
Take one prong each.

565
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,427
Just one prong?

566
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,080
At least break out the spoons?

567
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,734
No spoons.

568
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:29,348
Forks, one prong,
and I'llexpect those handles back.

569
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,611
I know it's not
all about me, but I

570
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,893
really feel like my leg
mayneed some kind of treatment.

571
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:36,790
Just keep the wound cleanand
watch out for numbness

572
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,314
or a foul-smelling discharge.

573
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,621
Those are the first
signs of gangrene.

generate a little heat?

On CSI, Gary treats
his team like a family,

630

and, like, they always
care for each other

631

with that attitude.

aunilateral decision to stop.

729
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,237
Vanderton University.

730
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,239
Vanderton Wealth Institute?

731
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:10,069
Whatever you want to call it,
it's lost us over 500 grand.

732
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,418
Oh my god.

733
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,202
That's the reason
the accounts are empty?

734
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,508
What do you mean empty?

735
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:15,857
I mean empty.

736
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,293
Empty of money?

737
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,513
That's the main thing
they're empty of, yes.

738
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:20,643
My money?

739
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,168
All our fucking money, dude.

740
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:24,039
Well, what about
the stock options?

741
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,388
They're worthless.

742
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,651
God dammit, guys.

743
00:30:27,782 --> 00:30:29,479
I just bought a dirt bike.

744
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,787
Look, we're all
in this together.

745
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:34,658
No, we're not.

746
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,009
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

747
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:40,360
I was going to quit on Monday.

748
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,752
I can't believe this shit.

749
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:45,017
I was doing this for all of us.

750
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:47,367
If the company is
in trouble, it's

751
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:50,849
because of yourincompetence and laziness.

752
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:54,069
It was your lack
ofcommunication and work ethic

753
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,462
that got us in this mess.

754
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:57,725
You don't listen to
a single thing we say.

755
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,206
You don't let us make
a single decision.

756
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:02,861
Lucy, why should we workhard
for you when you steal

757
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,688
any good ideas we come up with?

758
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,649
What are you talking about?

759
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:13,088
The Edible Cutlery,
Lucy, it was my idea.

760
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,311
The hell it was.

761
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,052
I can't believe this.

762
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,291
I came up with the idea when
Ifirst started working for Lucy.

763
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,945
All she had back then
was beauty products.

764
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,057
OK.

765
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:28,190
So maybe the spoons
were your idea,

766
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,193
but the knives and
forks were mine.

767
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:34,414
Spoons imply knives and forks.

768
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:38,331
No, there is no such
legal implication.

769
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:40,811
I mean, anyone can
come up with an idea.

770
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,509
It's another thing
to turn it into

771
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:44,728
a multi-million-dollar company.

772
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,905
Formermulti-million-dollar company.

773
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,907
I can't believe
you spent all this

774
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:52,606
money we don't have on
anidiotic team-building trip.

775
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:56,001
Well, I needed to
raise your idiotic game.

776
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:58,786
By burying us alive?

777
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,658
So the only good idea
this company's ever had

778
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:04,487
belongs to Freddie the fuck toy.

779
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:05,836
(MUSIC PLAYING)

780
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,664
Freddie the what?

781
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:10,363
Why do you think we call you FT?

782
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,669
Because those are my
initials, Freddy Tiwari.

783
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:17,457
Oh.

784
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:18,719
Oh my god.

785
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:19,415
You knew?

786
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,764
You all knew?

787
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:23,289
That Lucy uses you
as a human dildo?

788
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:24,203
Yeah.

789
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,248
Don't put it like that.

790
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,772
What is wrong with
two adult colleagues

791
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:30,818
having a relationship,
especially if they're

792
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,211
chill and not weird about it?

793
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,341
Exactly.

794
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,648
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

795
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,017
Because Freddie was
an intern at the time,

796
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,694
and fucking an
intern is essentially

797
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:41,742
half a step above fucking
ababysitter, in which case, no.

798
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:42,893
No shade to you or Aidan, but...

799
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:43,439
Oh, none taken.

800
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,093
JESS: Yikes.

801
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:46,941
Being Lucy's fuck toy isthe
only reason why you've

802
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,792
gotten preferential treatment.

803
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,055
What?

804
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,231
No, I don't get
preferential treatment.

805
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,276
I saw her give
you an extra prong.

806
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,105
I got the same crappy
prong as everyone else.

807
00:32:57,236 --> 00:33:00,848
And besides, it's not
entirely consensual.

808
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:04,678
OK?

809
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:07,028
Yeah, she's been
Weinsteining me.

810
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,725
Oh my god.

811
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:10,771
I have not Weinsteined you.

812
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:13,078
I have not Weinsteined anyone.

813
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,601
OK, OK.

814
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,211
Maybe not the full
Weinstein, but you

815
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:19,171
used your power in theworkplace
to get sexual favors.

816
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:21,434
Oh, like I need to do that.

817
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,437
We're a pair of
consenting adults.

818
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,961
You could have walked
out at any time.

819
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,354
You're my boss.

820
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:29,804
I might not have
a job if I didn't

821
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,140
agree to have sex with you.

822
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,621
Grow up.

823
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,058
All relationships are unequal.

824
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:40,975
I mean, men have been fuckingtheir
secretaries for decades.

825
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:42,585
Why can't women?

826
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:46,198
I guess because
it's kind of horrible.

827
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:50,724
Well, if women can't be
as horrible as men, then

828
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:53,074
what's fucking feminism for?

829
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:54,728
What?

830
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:55,990
Right?

831
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,123
That's a fresh
take on an old idea.

832
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:00,038
(THUD)

833
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:12,354
Chicken satay with
peanutsauce, roast belly pork

834
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:13,485
with Parmesan potatoes.

835
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,757
Black Forest gateau it's
salty caramel ice cream.

836
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,411
Oh my god.

837
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,258
I don't know what gateauis,
but that sounds good.

838
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:30,546
I can go for that.

839
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,548
Thank you.

840
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,464
It's the best one.

841
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,423

(WHIRRING)

843
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:43,342
Where are you going?

844
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:44,912
Over to the store
to get some Sprite.

845
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:55,267
We're so fucked.

846
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:56,529
We are so fucked.

847
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,575
For God's sakes,
shut the fuck up.

848
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,403
Oh, fuck you.

849
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,450
Fuck you.

850
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,191
Were all fucked because of you.

851
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,299
You were the one who thoughtthat
a stupid team-building

852
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,630
exercise and taking us downto
a fucking advance route

853
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,937
into an underground hell
holewould somehow magically unfuck

854
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,461
the company that you fucked.

855
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:19,552
Hey, it's not Lucy'sfault
there was a cave-in.

856
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,641
Thank you Suzy.

857
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:24,383
Oh, fuck both of you.

858
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,393
Hey, we all need to hold
it together down here.

859
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,472
Why?

860
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:28,952
Look, it's been days, people.

861
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,723
We have not heard any
digging or drilling.

862
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,826
So whether we keep
it together or not,

863
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:35,002
we're still fucked, right?

864

(GIGGLING)

865
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,527
Anybody not fucked?

866
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:40,703
The longest a human beinghas
ever gone without food

867
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,154
and water is, like, a week,
and we ran out of both of them,

868
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:45,273
so it's just a matter of time.

869
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,580
Shut up.

870
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,669
OK, I know.

871
00:35:56,241 --> 00:36:03,030
Listen, we don't know
forcertain when or if we're

872
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,075
going to be rescued, right?

873
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:10,211
But we do know for certain thatif
we don't eat something soon,

874
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:11,081
we're all going to die.

875
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,561
We know that.

876
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:13,692
We're aware of that.

877
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,347
I just want to mention the fact

878
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,758
that there's one food sourcethat
we haven't yet explored.

879
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:25,748
Oh my god.

880
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,315
You're fucking kidding.

881
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:28,751
Seriously?

882
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:32,015
I'm not saying we
should eat Brandon.

883
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:33,756
No.

884
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:37,586
I'm just saying we
could eat Brandon.

885
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,066
That's disgusting.

886
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,415
I couldn't eat a person.

887
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:43,375
I agree, it is disgusting.

888
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,465
But at the same time,
I'mterribly fucking hungry.

889
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:53,863
He did lead us down here.

890
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:57,954
Helping us survive is
the least he can do.

891
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,697
If we're going to
eat someone, it's

892
00:37:01,828 --> 00:37:05,092
more ethical to eat ourselves.

893
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,748
You mean cut off our armsand
eat them like James Franco?

894
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:11,577
I don't think James
Franco ate his own arm.

895
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:13,666
I'm not even my own fucking arm.

896
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:14,956
That's where I keep my watch.

897
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,669
I heard you should
eat the brain,

898
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:18,105
because it has sugar in it.

899
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,760
I got a good idea, Gloria.

900
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,128
Why don't you eat
your own brain?

901
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:24,111
Let me reiterate, OK?

902
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,418
I am not saying we
should eat Brandon.

903
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:31,553
But if we did eat Brandon,
how would we go about it?

904
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:42,999
I once took a sashimicourse
on vacation in Japan.

905
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,915
Did it involve
cutting up human flesh?

906
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:47,177
No, it was mostly salmon.

907
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,397
Is it OK that I hate everything

908
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:50,311
about this conversation?

909
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:53,096
It's... it's... it's
not a conversation.

910
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,751
It's a theoretical discussion.

911
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:56,665
You know what?

912
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:58,014
A thought experiment.

913
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,016
Oh, these are
for customers only?

914
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:03,411
Well, I'd be a customer if
you had any goddamn items.

915
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:04,760
Jeez.

916
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:07,285
Real quick, he's
deteriorating at such

917
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:08,416
a different rate than us.

918
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,809
I'm sorry.

919
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,047
I really don't mean
to be difficult. It's

920
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,681
my last question, I promise.

921
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:15,728
But do you happen to have
aThanksgiving dinner for nine?

922
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:19,514
Have you guys ever seenthat
Ethan Hawke movie, where

923
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,085
those people get
trapped in the Andes

924
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,344
and then they have
to eat their friends?

925
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:26,478
It's pretty messed up andgross,
but they had some time

926
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,958
to mull it over, because
the Andes is basically

927
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,657
like a big-ass refrigerator.

928
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,267
This cave isn't.

929
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,704
So sooner or later,
we're going to have

930
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:39,839
to make a hard choice
aboutwhat to do with that body.

931
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:41,710
She's right.

932
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,190
Brandon's getting ripe.

933
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:43,843
Ew.

934
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:47,194
Jesus Christ.

935
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,067
He's not a piece
of fruit, people.

936
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:53,156
I think you need
to all take a very

937
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:56,203
long, hard look at yourselves.

938
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:07,519
At least he's not
part of the group.

939
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,758
I mean, it wouldn't be likewe
were eating a colleague.

940
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:12,785
So it's OK even astranger,
just not your mom?

941
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:15,831
I'm not saying it's
OK to eat anyone.

942
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:18,660
But yes, I'd rather eat aguy
I just met who I thought

943
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,401
was an asshole than my mom.

944
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:21,576
Same.

945
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:26,494
I actually do know him a little.

946
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,192
Kind of got together with him.

947
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:32,021
When he came to the officeat
that meet and greet,

948
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:33,588
we went out for pizza.

949
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,719
One thing led to another.

950
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,725
Sex.

951
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:43,076
So I sort of feel like
maybe it would be nice

952
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:46,558
for us to not eat him, please.

953
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,042
Look, I don't
think that's a valid

954
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:55,305
proprietorial relationship.

955
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,089
Why?

956
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:57,003
What do you mean?

957
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:57,830
You fucked my lunch.

958
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
So what?

959
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:00,528
I don't care who fucked him.

960
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,835
I'm eating even before
heturns into a pile of goo.

961
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,097
I'm with you.

962
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,142
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

963
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:07,492
Hold up.

964
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,146
We need to make this
decision as a team,

965
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:13,541
and there's no I.
There's no I in team.

966
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:15,282
Yeah, but if you swap
the letters around,

967
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,979
it spells "meat."

968
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,419
We are going to be rescued.

969
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:25,379
And is that how you want tobe
discovered, with Brandon's

970
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,294
ear hanging out of your mouth?

971
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,818
I thought of everything, guys.

972
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:33,518
I'm sorry, but that
place is bullshit.

973
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:35,302
So what did I miss?

974
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,219
Guys, Brandon's a human being.

975
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:43,571
He has a family, and
friends, and feelings.

976
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:46,705
I mean, I know that thisis
a desperate situation,

977
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:53,842
but if we lose our humanity,
we've lost everything.

978
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:54,973
Let's take a vote.

979
00:40:57,672 --> 00:41:00,196
Who's in for eating Brandon?

980
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:07,366
Wait, what are we voting on?

981
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:08,466
Seriously?

982
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,297
Somebody give me a hand.

983
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,647
I'm out.

984
00:41:15,777 --> 00:41:19,346
Hey, Brandon,
buddy, I'm so sorry.

985
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:24,307
If you can see this from heaven,
just know that we all love you.

986
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:25,700
What the fuck?

987
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,006
(GRUNTING)

988
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:29,965
He's only got one arm.

989
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,750
Someone's stolen an arm.

990
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:41,020
Who's got themselves a
nice little snacky arm?

991
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,416
Who looks the fullest?

992
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,766
You do.

993
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:48,896
Huh?

994
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:56,470
Who's been munching
on some finger food.

995
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,996
How about you, queen bee?

996
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:01,823
Huh?

997
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:03,085
What about me?

998
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:10,832
Be my guest.

999
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:12,163
I don't have anything to hide.

1000
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:23,410
What?

1001
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,979
You just back the fuck off.

1002
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,807
This is an invasion of privacy.

1003
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,162
(RATTLING)

1004
00:42:38,294 --> 00:42:40,122
(GRUNTS)

1005
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:46,999
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1006
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:04,973
Here it is, the smoking arm.

1007
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,714
Lucy.

1008
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,498
She stole it.

1009
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:11,240
She's been feasting on freshmeat
while we've been starving?

1010
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,416
So that's why you didn'twant
us to eat Brandon.

1011
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:15,157
You wanted to keep
him all to yourself?

1012
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:16,637
You sick fuck.

1013
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:19,031
I fed and watered Brandon.

1014
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:21,207
I bought him a burrito, OK?

1015
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,488
His nutrients should be mine.

1016
00:43:22,512 --> 00:43:24,036
Well, you've had your share.

1017
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,559
The rest of him is ours.

1018
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,302
Jesus fucking Christ.

1019
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:31,086
The caving permit.

1020
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,828
Oh, no, no, the caving permitthat
you said that you filed

1021
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:35,613
with the ranger
station, the caving

1022
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:38,063
permit that you couldn't
havefiled with the ranger station

1023
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:40,052
because I'm holding
in my fucking hand.

1024
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:41,967
How could you?

1025
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:43,925
Oh, shit.

1026
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:45,318
Oh shit, shit.

1027
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:46,928
No one knows we're here.

1028
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,364
No one's coming to see us.

1029
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,323
I hate you, Lucy.

1030
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:51,977
I really fucking hate you.

1031
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:54,370
Why did you say
you handed it in?

1032
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:57,896
I thought that I had.

1033
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:00,115
I... I must have
gotten side tracked

1034
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:03,075
when I was helping you with... with
the boulders, and then I...

1035
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:06,034
I was looking for some
ass-wiping material,

1036
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:07,340
and I found it.

1037
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,952
I was trying to
protect you, and it's

1038
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,302
just been so much pressure.

1039
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:16,523
And look, I then made
an executive decision,

1040
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,657
because if you knew that
I hadn't, you guys...

1041
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:21,702
It would have just
gotten... gotten weird.

1042
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:22,572
You fucked us.

1043
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,662
You fucked us all.

1044
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:30,145
That is exactly what
I was talking about.

1045
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:34,149
Somebody is going
to find the tour bus

1046
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,498
and... and a yellow Porsche.

1047
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:36,954
How could they... how
could they miss it?

1048
00:44:36,978 --> 00:44:38,347
We're in the middle
of the fucking desert.

1049
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:38,850
No one's going to see
that yellow Porsche.

1050
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,547
OK, wait.

1051
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,810
Everybody calm down, OK?

1052
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:45,160
Even though Lucy
super fucked us,

1053
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,988
we still need to focus
on staying alive.

1054
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,210
And all we can doright now is eat Brandon,

1055
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,646
so I suggest we eat Brandon.

1056
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:00,306
Who wants first bite?

1057
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:02,612
Fuck it, I'll do it.

1058
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:05,790
I'll do it.

1059
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Here, give it to me.

1060
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,625
(CHEWING)

1061
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,195
Does it tastes like chicken?

1062
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:21,326
No.

1063
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,114
OK.

1064
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:29,596
It's chewy it's
definitely a chewy...

1065
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,598
A chewy dish.

1066
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,557
(THUD)

1067
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:37,996

1068
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,436
(GRUNTING)

1069
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:04,674
Why go to all the troubleof
putting me in a prison when

1070
00:46:04,805 --> 00:46:06,807
we're already all in a prison?

1071
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:09,375
We're putting you in prisonbecause
you're a damn criminal

1072
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:12,378
and you deserve to be punished.

1073
00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:15,555
Well, it's totalbullshit, because I could

1074
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,557
get out whenever I wanted.

1075
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:20,690
No, you can't, because
we won't let you.

1076
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,042
Yeah, this is ametaphorical
cage in addition

1077
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,478
to being an actual cage.

1078
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:31,614
It was just a part of an arm.

1079
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:34,400
God.

1080
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,489
Somebody had to be
the meat pioneer.

1081
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,578
Right, and it had to be you.

1082
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,928
It always has to be you.

1083
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:44,323
At least I showed
some restraint.

1084
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:48,370
You little piggies ain't enoughof
Brandon to last us a month,

1085
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:49,894
you greedy fucks.

1086
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:58,337
So how are you feeling
post eating Brandon?

1087
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:03,951
Full, partially of Brandon,
mostly of self-loathing.

1088
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:06,388
Yeah, that was pretty gnarly.

1089
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:07,519
Yeah.

1090
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:11,350
FREDDIE: What the fuck.

1091
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,220
JESS: Holy shit.

1092
00:47:12,351 --> 00:47:12,960
SUZY: What was that?

1093
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:13,961
DEREK: Goddamn.

1094
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:14,832
What the hell is happening.

1095
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,790
Maybe the battery died.

1096
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,705
Does anybody have
aflashlight on their phone

1097
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,924
or a headlamp that works?

1098
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,054
Shit.

1099
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:22,404
Please, please, please.

1100
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,188
(ZAPPING)

1101
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:23,928
Fuck.

1102
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:26,495
JESS: Oh my god.

1103
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:29,847
MAY: Oh, thank god.

1104
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:31,936
Oh, I guess you dickheads didn't

1105
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:35,113
take care of your headlamps.

1106
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,462
Hey.

1107
00:47:36,592 --> 00:47:37,592
No prisoner property.

1108
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,465
I'm confiscating that.

1109
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:40,596
Watch the hair.

1110
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:41,467
Hey.

1111
00:47:41,597 --> 00:47:42,597
Ah!

1112
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:43,904
Hey, how much battery is left?

1113
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:44,774
How long does it have?

1114
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,037
No idea.

1115
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:49,867
Guys, I have something
that might help.

1116
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,917
It's a wearable kinetic charger.

1117
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,484
A what?

1118
00:47:58,614 --> 00:48:00,462
It's like one of
thoseshake-to-shine flashlights.

1119
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:03,619
It transfers my armmovements
into electricity.

1120
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,491
Wow.

1121
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,667
Great stuff, Aidan.

1122
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:11,279
Where did you get that?

1123
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,760
It comes in handy
when you're traveling.

1124
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,198
You mean like when you'rein a hotel
room, beating off?

1125
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:20,506
Well, yeah.

1126
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:22,987
It's called the Wankband.

1127
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:24,771
OK.

1128
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,054
Guys, personally,
I don't lovethe idea of watching Aidan rub

1129
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:28,644
himself stupid just
to give us enough

1130
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:32,692
light to watch ourselves
die of starvation.

1131
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:35,738
Do you have a better idea?

1132
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:37,175
Yeah.

1133
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:40,134
I think we should try
the tunnel Aidan found.

1134
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,441
(CLATTERING)

1135
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:45,052
You ever heard the expression,
when you're in a hole,

1136
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:46,706
stop digging?

1137
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:49,665
It's better to go furtherdown
than just stay up here.

1138
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:52,320
No, it's clearly worse.

1139
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,496
What could be worse than this?

1140
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:57,717
Imagine this, but also you're...

1141
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:58,674
You're dead.

1142
00:48:58,805 --> 00:49:00,111
OK.

1143
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,417
Guys, if we don't try to
find a way out of here,

1144
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:04,332
we're all going to die.

1145
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,247
Now, I'm going down there.

1146
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:08,597
Who's going with me?

1147
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:09,728
I can't.

1148
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:12,862
I'm all lupused out.

1149
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:14,386
I'll go.

1150
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:15,778
Great.

1151
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:17,191
Yeah, this is the
right thing to do.

1152
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:20,870
Yeah, take some action,
maximize our odds.

1153
00:49:21,001 --> 00:49:22,022
We're going to
need the headlamp.

1154
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:22,611
Fuck that.

1155
00:49:22,742 --> 00:49:24,439
Finders keepers.

1156
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,461
All right, then you keep
theheadlamp and then come with us.

1157
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:27,485
Fuck that.

1158
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:34,275
Listen, you probablydon't
know this about me,

1159
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:37,670
but I was married once.

1160
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,020
My wife's name was Claire.

1161
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:42,501
She died.

1162
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:45,504
I remember cleaning outthis
closet after she died

1163
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:49,029
and finding this beach ball.

1164
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,206
I remembered it was
Claire who blew it up.

1165
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:55,862
I got rid of everything
that reminded me of her.

1166
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,908
It was just too painful.

1167
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,392
But one thing I couldn'tget
rid of was that ball.

1168
00:50:04,523 --> 00:50:08,657
I still have it,
because Claire's breath

1169
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:10,746
is still in there.

1170
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:14,054
And as long as there's
breath in my body,

1171
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,491
and Claire's breath
is in that beach ball,

1172
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:21,714
I'm going to find us
a way out of here, OK?

1173
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:24,108
And I need your help.

1174
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:25,848
You should do it, Billy.

1175
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:27,459
Yeah, Billy.

1176
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:29,749
It'd actually be nice to
take a little break from you.

1177
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:32,203
You've been nothing but
amoaning drain on all of us

1178
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,333
since we got down here.

1179
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:37,207
Wow.

1180
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:41,690
OK.

1181
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:45,303
Here, take it.

1182
00:50:45,433 --> 00:50:46,826
But you're not going with me.

1183
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:48,436
Oh, wow.

1184
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:49,872
Great, yeah.

1185
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:51,700
Just maybe put some clothes on.

1186
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:53,093
Uh-huh.

1187
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:56,009
For Claire.

1188
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,619
Wow, that was amazing.

1189
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,360
Thanks.

1190
00:50:59,491 --> 00:51:01,710
I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

1191
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,081
I didn't know you were married.

1192
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:05,062
Also, you must have
been super young.

1193
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:07,673
Yeah.

1194
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:11,198
Actually, that was quote.

1195
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:12,112
What?

1196
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:12,982
A quote.

1197
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,158
What?

1198
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:16,334
Oh, the speech,
it's from CSI New

1199
00:51:16,464 --> 00:51:18,727
York season one episode one.

1200
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:19,858
OK.

1201
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:21,295
But it worked though, right?

1202
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:22,731
Yeah, yeah.

1203
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:24,472
Totally.

1204
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:26,474
Good old Gary Sinise.

1205
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:28,563
Hey, listen.

1206
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:32,959
Thank you, you know, for
having my back just now

1207
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,440
and just, I don't
know, being awesome

1208
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:38,007
through this whole experience.

1209
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:40,706
I think we make a
pretty good team.

1210
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:42,273
Wow.

1211
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:44,753
Is this... is this
friendshipright now happening?

1212
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:45,624
Oh, yeah, it is.

1213
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:46,842
OK, cool.

1214
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:48,931
Yeah, it's weird, a good weird.

1215
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:49,758
Yeah.

1216
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:50,672
It's a good weird.

1217
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:51,325
Friend request sent.

1218
00:51:51,456 --> 00:51:52,283
Oh, got it.

1219
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:53,893
Accept.

1220
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:57,549
Hey, you two lovebirds,
don't hold back on my account.

1221
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,204
What the... that's not
what's happening here.

1222
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:01,901
It's so not what's
happening right now.

1223
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:03,381
Besides, he's got
Brandon breath.

1224
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:04,619
- Really?
- It's totally fine.

1225
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:05,643
I have it, too.

1226
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:06,253
We just ate, like, a whole dude.

1227
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:07,384
OK.

1228
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:13,260
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1229
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,067
Oh, OK, guys.

1230
00:52:39,112 --> 00:52:40,192
Definitely don't look down.

1231
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:48,121
Oh, God.

1232
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:49,253
Jesus Christ.

1233
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:50,428
Calm down.

1234
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:52,647
OK, OK.

1235
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:54,058
What the hell am
I doing up here?

1236
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:54,910
I'm not a hero.

1237
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,434
I'm a cowardly asshole.

1238
00:52:56,564 --> 00:53:00,307
I'm really comfortablebeing
a cowardly asshole.

1239
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:04,224
Uh, there's a ledge andl'm
going to have to jump,

1240
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,531
so should I jump?

1241
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,010
Yeah.

1242
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:09,597
I mean, if you're going
to jump, fucking jump.

1243
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,796
(SHOUTING)

1244
00:53:10,926 --> 00:53:14,713
Jess, I jumped.

1245
00:53:14,843 --> 00:53:16,149
OK.

1246
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,542
(SHOUTING)

1247
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:24,201
Oh, god.

1248
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:25,331
Oh.

1249
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:30,729
Moaning drain.

1250
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:32,252
I mean, you know, come on.

1251
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:33,969
It's not like I'm
completelyclosed to criticism,

1252
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:37,344
but any way you slice that,
that is just fucking rude.

1253
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,259
Guys, what is that light?

1254
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:41,479
Oh my god.

1255
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,872
I think we found... Oh my
god, it's water.

1256
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:45,570
Oh god, I'm thirsty.

1257
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,788
JESS: Oh my gosh.

1258
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:49,356
BILLY: I'm so thirsty.

1259
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:50,575
JESS: Wait.

1260
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:52,141
How do you know
it's safe to drink.

1261
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:53,099
It's cave water.

1262
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,448

1440
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:05,939
Hey, stop it.

1441
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,350
Don't do it if he's not into it.

1442
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:08,507
What?

1443
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:09,987
He just said he
might be into it.

1444
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,163
Well, I'm not
completely not into it.

1445
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:14,861
But at the same time,
I'mnot completely into it.

1446
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:18,560
He's been jerking himselfsilly
for, like, days, guys.

1447
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:20,867
He doesn't know whether he
wants a shit or a haircut.

1448
01:02:20,998 --> 01:02:22,739
God, I would love
to get a haircut,

1449
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:25,785
and take a shit, or both.

1450
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,309
I feel terrible.

1451
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,182
It's my joints.

1452
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:35,142
I need some
anti-inflammatoriesfor my lupus.

1453
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,623
If it gets worse, I
might have a seizure.

1454
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,103
Oh, no.

1455
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:41,279
What are you doing?

1456
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:43,020
Nothing.

1457
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,310
You're looking at me likel'm
a turkey at Thanksgiving.

1458
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,939
That is a terrible
delicious thing to say.

1459
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:53,552
Lupus, that's a very
serious illness, right?

1460
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:57,948
How long can a person gowithout
medicine, theoretically?

1461
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,428
I don't know.

1462
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,301
But if I die, Lucy is
not allowed to eat me.

1463
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:05,520
What do you care?

1464
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:06,651
You'd be dead.

1465
01:03:09,089 --> 01:03:16,401
OK, I am hereby making
an official legal will.

1466
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:22,102
Everybody apart from Lucy
isallowed to eat me if I die.

1467
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,496
Not even a finger?

1468
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:27,455
Jess, you get first
pick of my parts.

1469
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:31,111
You always watch out for me,
and I've always liked you.

1470
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:33,505
OK, thanks.

1471
01:03:33,635 --> 01:03:35,333
Just tell me what
part you want and I'll

1472
01:03:35,463 --> 01:03:37,770
put your name next to it.

1473
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:41,382
Why don't you pick, you know?

1474
01:03:41,513 --> 01:03:42,949
Surprise me.

1475
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,213
If Jess doesn't wantit,
can I get an asscheek?

1476
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:50,043
I really don't mind whichone,
but if I had to choose,

1477
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:51,305
I'd say lefty.

1478
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:52,263
Hey, good choice.

1479
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:53,481
Freddie gets second pick.

1480
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:55,788
I don't give a shit.

1481
01:03:55,919 --> 01:04:00,837
Well, not the response
I was hoping for.

1482
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:06,451
Listen, I've been
on a vision quest.

1483
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:09,454
I've seen through theother
end of the telescope.

1484
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:12,500
I've looked at the other
side of the potato.

1485
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:14,372
And you know what I learned?

1486
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:18,289
That this company is bullshit,
and you can all shove my Edible.

1487
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:20,291
Cutlery up your assholes.

1488
01:04:20,421 --> 01:04:23,337
We're all just eyelashes
on the face of God.

1489
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,123
OK, whatever.

1490
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:29,082
Maybe we should try
drinking our own piss.

1491
01:04:29,213 --> 01:04:31,780
Huh?

1492
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,305
What would happen if
we drank our own piss?

1493
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:36,524
We'd still die,
but the last thing we'd taste

1494
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:37,656
would be our own piss.

1495
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:44,271
Hey.

1496
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:45,640
Hey, prisoner leaving theprison
area, what are you doing?

1497
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:46,664
Get back in there.

1498
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:55,892
OK.

1499
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:57,806
I don't want to be
the voice of doom.

1500
01:04:57,937 --> 01:05:02,594
But I think that Gloria'snot
looking too good.

1501
01:05:02,724 --> 01:05:04,901
Lady Gaga has lupus.

1502
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:07,729
If she has it, it
can't be that bad.

1503
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,122
I don't think so.

1504
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:10,645
What is your point?

1505
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:11,908
OK.

1506
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:16,303
My point is are we
going to just sit

1507
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:18,436
here and wait for
her to die, or are

1508
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:21,221
we going to speed things up?

1509
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:23,745
You mean like with the...

1510
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:26,139
Like hitting her with a rock?

1511
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:30,230
That's horrible, no.

1512
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:32,841
I was thinking more like
a coat over the face.

1513
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:35,279
My god.

1514
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:35,932
Jesus.

1515
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:38,282
What?

1516
01:05:38,412 --> 01:05:40,632
It's good, right?

1517
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:43,461
This is all I could muster.

1518
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:44,810
Anybody want some?

1519
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,551
No, thank you.

1520
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,596
I'm good.

1521
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:49,858
I'm not there yet.

1522
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:52,252
But an asscheek
and a swig of this,

1523
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,863
and won't be no
talking on both jaws.

1524
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:55,994
What?

1525
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:00,217
Even got some fizz to it.

1526
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:01,696
Hard pass.

1527
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:02,567
More for me.

1528
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:03,698
You're still peeing?

1529
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:07,093
I haven't peed in three days.

1530
01:06:07,224 --> 01:06:08,399
Poems, oh.

1531
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:09,139
Hey.

1532
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:10,401
Look at this.

1533
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:11,769
Gloria's been writing
fucking poetry.

1534
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:12,664
Give me that.

1535
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:13,317
That's private.

1536
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:15,580
Hold on.

1537
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:20,193
My plight has given me wealthmore
important than my health.

1538
01:06:20,324 --> 01:06:24,763
Trapped in this cavern of doom,
I have found some psychic room.

1539
01:06:24,893 --> 01:06:29,986
When I feel the darkness call,
I see God's face on the wall.

1540
01:06:30,116 --> 01:06:31,596
Which wall is that, Gloria?

1541
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:33,661
Is that the one that Derektook
a giant shit against?

1542
01:06:33,685 --> 01:06:36,862
OK, well, it's a
first draft, so...

1543
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,153
Poetry is not a crime, Billy.

1544
01:06:38,255 --> 01:06:39,362
Give her back her
fucking notebook.

1545
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:40,170
Uh-huh.

1546
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,433
Shit, hold on now.

1547
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:45,740
I hereby give permissionfor
posthumous publication

1548
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:47,351
of these poems.

1549
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:51,790
You're going to publish,
make money off our deaths?

1550
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,574
That's for my girls.

1551
01:06:53,705 --> 01:06:54,987
I just want to leave
them something.

1552
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,751
Fuck those little assholes.

1553
01:06:56,882 --> 01:06:58,492
They're seven and nine.

1554
01:06:58,623 --> 01:07:02,931
Well, I refuse to
bememorialized by shitty poetry.

1555
01:07:03,062 --> 01:07:04,368
It's embarrassing.

1556
01:07:04,498 --> 01:07:06,979
Like, who uses rhyming
couplets anymore?

1557
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,589
If you hate it so
much, why don't you

1558
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,330
write your own fucking poetry?

1559
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:11,723
You know what?

1560
01:07:11,853 --> 01:07:15,292
How about the punishment
for writing bad poetry

1561
01:07:15,422 --> 01:07:18,556
should be that we kill
Gloria and eat her?

1562
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:20,732
Jesus Christ.

1563
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:22,560
You've lost your fucking mind.

1564
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,779
No, this is survival
of the fittest.

1565
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:26,520
Survival of the fittest doesn't

1566
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:27,782
mean killing the unfittest.

1567
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:30,046
Nobody is killing anyone.

1568
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:31,786
If we die, we die together.

1569
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:35,573
What's wrong with one of
usdying to save the rest of us?

1570
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:38,445
As long as the one
who dies isn't you.

1571
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:40,969
I mean, I'll freely
admit that if one of us

1572
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,189
dies I am going to eat
them in a heartbeat.

1573
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:44,799
But what you suggesting is...

1574
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,386
There's crossing the lineand
then there's smashing

1575
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,673
through it with a truck.

1576
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:49,891
I get it.

1577
01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:52,024
Not everyone has
balls big enough

1578
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:54,461
to make the hard decisions.

1579
01:07:54,592 --> 01:07:55,941
That's what leaders do.

1580
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,508
It's the white man's burden.

1581
01:07:57,638 --> 01:08:00,163
Oh, so you're a white
man now, Acama queen?

1582
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:03,818
I wear many hats.

1583
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:06,952
I know why you
want to eat Gloria.

1584
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,346
It's because you're a vampire.

1585
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:12,871
You've been sucking my bloodfor
years, but all of that

1586
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:13,741
stops now.

1587
01:08:13,872 --> 01:08:15,613
That is bullshit.

1588
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:21,097
You wanted a sexy as
helltough as nails lady boss,

1589
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:23,229
and you just couldn't handle it.

1590
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,275
OK, fine.

1591
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,841
It's true.

1592
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:28,558
I didn't have the confidenceto
make my idea work.

1593
01:08:28,582 --> 01:08:29,627
You did.

1594
01:08:29,757 --> 01:08:31,063
And you know what?

1595
01:08:31,194 --> 01:08:33,631
I liked it when you fucked me.

1596
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:38,201
Yeah, I even liked it
whenyou put things up my ass

1597
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:39,985
occasionally.

1598
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:44,337
But when I stopped liking it and
I asked you to stop doing it,

1599
01:08:44,468 --> 01:08:48,863
you carried on, and
that's not OK, Lucy.

1600
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:53,651
And I'm not going to
let you do it anymore.

1601
01:08:53,781 --> 01:08:58,308
Fuck you and fuck this company.

1602
01:08:58,438 --> 01:08:59,787
I resign.

1603
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:03,791
I'm going to stop
workingand start knitting.

1604
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:05,445
Knitting?

1605
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:07,708
Just because I'm a guydoesn't
mean I can't knit, OK?

1606
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:08,927
OK.

1607
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:10,122
I'm going to knit
the most amazing

1608
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,669
sweater you've ever seen.

1609
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:13,323
Freddie's right.

1610
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,455
You have some major
boundary issues.

1611
01:09:15,586 --> 01:09:17,706
You guys know that shethreatened
to fire me because I

1612
01:09:17,762 --> 01:09:19,155
turned off my
phone for two hours

1613
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:20,765
while I attended my
grandma's funeral?

1614
01:09:20,808 --> 01:09:23,898
I was hosting my bestfriend's
bachelorette party,

1615
01:09:24,029 --> 01:09:26,118
and we needed a patio
heater delivered.

1616
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:27,878
I mean, do you know howcold
it was when the patio?

1617
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:31,993
It is not my job to keepyou
cold-ass friends warm.

1618
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:36,781
You... you break my heart.

1619
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:39,784
I mentored you because
I wanted a little

1620
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:43,701
of the light that's alwaysshined
on me to reflect on you.

1621
01:09:43,831 --> 01:09:46,399
When I found out your momdied
when you were so young,

1622
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:49,359
I decided to be the
mom that you never had.

1623
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:50,229
What the fuck?

1624
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,970
It was never enough.

1625
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:55,974
You just wanted more, more, more.
You and your fucking MBA,

1626
01:09:56,104 --> 01:09:57,671
he didn't want to be my mentee.

1627
01:09:57,802 --> 01:09:59,543
You didn't want to work for me.

1628
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:01,849
No, you wanted to replace me.

1629
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,914
I don't want to be in yourshadow
for the rest of my life.

1630
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:06,027
Is that a crime?

1631
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:08,682
You need to get real.

1632
01:10:08,813 --> 01:10:09,814
Would you be without me?

1633
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:13,600
Not in this fucking cave, Lucy.

1634
01:10:13,731 --> 01:10:19,824
Do you know when I
hiredyou, and you, and you,

1635
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:25,395
and you, and you, I stepped up?

1636
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:29,268
I gave you an opportunityof a lifetime.

1637
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:33,620
And yes, there was some
sweet, sweet grant money

1638
01:10:33,751 --> 01:10:35,796
from the minorities
and business agency,

1639
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:38,712
but that was just a bonus.

1640
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:43,587
I did this for all of you asa
gift, a gift from my heart.

1641
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:46,372
You never gave us anything, OK?

1642
01:10:46,503 --> 01:10:49,897
We all worked really
hardto get to where we are.

1643
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:54,946
Two words, affirmative action.

1644
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,556
Do you want to be a quota queen?

1645
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:57,992
Is that what you want?

1646
01:10:58,123 --> 01:11:00,256
Because you better
start asking yourself,

1647
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:04,912
who am I when I'm notblack
and I'm not a woman?

1648
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:09,308
Who am I and what
do I have to give?

1649
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,832
You know what?

1650
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,530
It's people like
you think you're

1651
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,402
part of the solution when
you'rethe whole fucking problem.

1652
01:11:16,533 --> 01:11:17,813
And on top of
that, your opinions

1653
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:20,014
are bad you're a huge asshole.

1654
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,886
In fact, the only
good idea you ever had

1655
01:11:22,016 --> 01:11:23,907
was Freddie's,
and the onlything you'll ever be famous

1656
01:11:23,931 --> 01:11:26,040
for is for the fact that you
ateour dead spelunking instructor.

1657
01:11:26,064 --> 01:11:28,632
Don't you talk to
your mother that way.

1658
01:11:28,762 --> 01:11:29,589
You're not my mother.

1659
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,156
Yes I am.

1660
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,071
FREDDIE: Get the fuck off her!

1661
01:11:36,074 --> 01:11:37,293
Fuck.

1662
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:38,423
Oh my god.

1663
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:47,651
Oh my god.

1664
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:48,956
Oh, god.

1665
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:49,783
I'm sorry, Lucy.

1666
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:53,221
I didn't mean to... no, Lucy.

1667
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:55,136
I'm so sorry.

1668
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,747
I'm sorry.

1669
01:12:01,795 --> 01:12:03,144

What the hell is that?

1672
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,894
Britney?

1673
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:16,070
Is that you, Britney?

1674
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:17,420
Is that a drill?

1675
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:18,682
Oh my god, it is.

1676
01:12:18,812 --> 01:12:20,031
It's a drill!

1677
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:22,860
(CHEERING)

1678
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:27,560
BILLY: Hey, Hey, we're in here.

1679
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:28,866
Freddie.

1680
01:12:28,996 --> 01:12:29,996
Yeah, yeah.

1681
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:39,572
I'm going to rat you
out, you manslaughterer.

1682
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:45,752
You're going to
die alone in jail.

1683
01:12:45,883 --> 01:12:46,883
You pussy.

1684
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:51,279
What's up?

1685
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:52,410
Is she dead?

1686
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:56,415
What?

1687
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:58,069
She says she's
going to tell the cops

1688
01:12:58,199 --> 01:12:59,679
that I tried to kill her.

1689
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:00,637
I'm going to go to jail.

1690
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:01,638
No.

1691
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:02,552
I'm going to die in jail.

1692
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:03,770
No.

1693
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:04,728
OK, you were trying
to protect me.

1694
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:05,879
She's a fucking sociopath.

1695
01:13:05,903 --> 01:13:07,470
Let's just say that she tripped.

1696
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,664
What if they send a cracksquad
of forensic investigators

1697
01:13:08,688 --> 01:13:10,081
with black lights?

1698
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:11,667
This is exactly the kindof
case that a crack squad

1699
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:13,060
of forensic investigators
with black lights

1700
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:14,148
would solve within seconds.

1701
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,279
They're not going to do that.

1702
01:13:15,303 --> 01:13:16,522
This isn't CSI.

1703
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:19,656
All you have to do
is relax, OK, and not

1704
01:13:19,786 --> 01:13:22,006
tell them the whole
truthabout what happened.

1705
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:23,921
I can't lie to the police.

1706
01:13:24,051 --> 01:13:25,662
They'll never believe me.

1707
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:26,576
OK.

1708
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:29,883
Everybody, listen up.

1709
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:31,450
All right?

1710
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:33,167
When the rescuers get
downhere, she's going to try

1711
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:35,149
and get Freddie arrested.

1712
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,360
We need to make sure
thatFreddie knows that he's not

1713
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,023
alone, OK, that we're
not going to let

1714
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:40,193
him take the rap for this.

1715
01:13:43,288 --> 01:13:45,725
We need to finish
what he started.

1716
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:47,118
I wasn't trying to kill her.

1717
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:50,730
It's OK, I got this.

1718
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:53,254
Teamwork makes the dream work.

1719
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:56,170

01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:08,444
Lucy, Lucy, I'm so sorry.

1722
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:10,315
I didn't mean for
you to hit your head.

1723
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,099
I just didn't want
you to hurt Jess.

1724
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:15,320
And I... I know I know I saidsome
horrible things about you,

1725
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,496
but you're a good person.

1726
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:21,718
I mean, you're
not, but you were.

1727
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:24,503
We had some good times,
right, in the early days,

1728
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:26,897
like that... like the
trip to Sausalito?

1729
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:28,333
Remember?

1730
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,944
We ate the clam chowder
in the bread bowls.

1731
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:35,819
They served soup in bowls madeout of
bread, and we ate it.

1732
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:39,605
The soup, the bowl,
the whole damn thing.

1733
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:42,739
(GRUNTING)

1734
01:14:42,869 --> 01:14:43,870
Come on!

1735
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:48,571
Fuck.

1736
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:50,007
It's too heavy.

1737
01:14:50,137 --> 01:14:52,357
You guys, what about
Brandon's walking pole?

1738
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,314
Yes.

1739
01:14:53,445 --> 01:14:54,272
Actually, that's perfect.

1740
01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:55,708
We can use it as a lever.

1741
01:14:55,839 --> 01:14:58,711
And it's metal, so it
won't snap this time.

1742
01:14:58,842 --> 01:15:02,019
That's what gave me theidea
for the Edible Cutlery.

1743
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:03,760
Yeah.

1744
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:06,676
I mean, if you can eat a bowl,
why not a spoon, you know?

1745
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:09,635
Lucy, if you hadn't taken meto
Sausalito on company money

1746
01:15:09,766 --> 01:15:12,420
to fuck my brains
out, I never would

1747
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:14,597
have eaten the bread
bowl, and I never would

1748
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:16,903
have thought of the spoons.

trying to say something.

1758
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:38,055
These might be her last words.

1759
01:15:38,185 --> 01:15:39,709
Yeah.

OK, everybody's.

1766
01:15:57,204 --> 01:15:59,555

together as a team.

something about Lucy.

nextpart is so hard to say.

1859
01:19:42,299 --> 01:19:44,127
Don't say it.

1860
01:19:44,257 --> 01:19:47,434
It was really tragic.

The way the rock just
fell on her sucked.

01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:58,881
Yeah, she was lying
down celebrating

1864
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:03,450
and the rock was worked
loose by the drilling,

1865
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:05,235
and then it just fell.

1866
01:20:05,365 --> 01:20:07,411
Sort of off a ridge.

1867
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,239
Right on top of Lucy.

1868
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:11,371
So it was the rescuers' fault.

1869
01:20:11,502 --> 01:20:14,157
Well, no one's
playing the blame game.

blamesomeone, it would be them.
