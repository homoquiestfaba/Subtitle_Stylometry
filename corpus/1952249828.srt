1
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,384
Found her outside, Doctor.

2
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,810
She was well along then.
Sally pulled the baby out of her.

3
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,709
The usual.
Never learn, these girls.

4
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,749
They give it all up for a bit
of sweet talk and a few pretty clothes

5
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,342
off some fancy man.

6
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,109
Wouldn't catch me
falling for none of that.

7
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,749
What about the child?

8
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:35,864
Probably best if it's carried off
with the same fever as her.

9
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,309
It's hungry.

10
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,052
They always are.

11
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,829
Greedy mouths

12
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:48,015
wanting to be fed
and who has to shoulder the burden?

13
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,709
It's a cross we must bear, Mrs Carney.

14
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,322
You're cold, Doctor,

15
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,669
get you a nip of gin to warm you.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,700
Once it's done,
fetch Sowerberry for the box.

17
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:04,308
- And get that badged and ticketed.
- Yes, Mrs Corney.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,427
Fumigate that good dress of her,
get the mud off and I'll take it.

19
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:09,869
- Yes, Mrs Corney.
- I'll have that petticoat and all.

20
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:13,669
She won't need that linen
and lace where she's going.

21
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:27,431
The baby...

22
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,012
The baby?

23
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:31,349
A boy.

24
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:34,931
I want to see him.

25
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,332
Let me see...

26
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:56,953
He's strong.

27
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,229
I'm going to die, aren't I?

28
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:05,720
We're all gonna die.

29
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:10,499
In my purse.

30
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:13,193
There's a letter.

31
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:16,349
Send it for me, please?
For the baby, please?

32
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:19,069
Ain't really my place. Miss.

33
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,789
You must send it.
You must.

34
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,669
He'll come for the child.

35
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,421
Can you tell him,

36
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,131
despite everything,

37
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:35,756
Agnes never forgot
his kindness and love.

38
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,397
Please, send the letter.
Please.

39
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,724
My son.

40
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,074
My little boy.

41
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,549
All right then, I've scrubbed you in,
now get on with it.

42
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,275
No sneezing, Twist!

43
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:13,765
Don't do it.
Don't eat it.

44
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:15,789
I'm hungry!

45
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:17,336
You and all.

46
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:19,309
But don't do it.

47
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,749
They'll beat ya.

48
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,669
There! There, Mr Bumble Sir!
In his mouth!

49
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:32,949
I seed him, Sir!

50
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:37,309
- Thief!
- I said, didn't I! I said!

51
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,869
Stealing!
Caught red-handed!

52
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:44,355
Punish him, Mr Bumble!

53
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,669
For the good of us all!
Punish him, Sir!

54
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,069
I will, Mrs Carney!
I will.

55
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,630
For what we are about to receive,

56
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:26,229
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

57
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:28,514
Amen!

58
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:47,108
Oh, Mr Bumble,
you are such a joker.

59
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,549
You, boy!
You! Back to your place.

60
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,229
What do you want?

61
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:27,149
Please, Sir.
I want some more.

62
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,549
What did...

63
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:31,999
What did you say?

64
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,651
I said,

65
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:36,245
please Sir...

66
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,828
I want some more.

67
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:47,602
Oliver Twist, Sirs.

68
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,512
I thought it best to bring him to you
to decide what to do with him, Sirs.

69
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:56,709
I wonder, Bumble, if you are not
failing as a disciplinarian.

70
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:58,333
Me, Sir?

71
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:02,429
Only today, under your guard,
a boy stole oakum to eat.

72
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:05,526
I, I thrashed the boy soundly, Sir.

73
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,189
Blisters, Sir, blisters!
Fresh ones!

74
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:11,252
There will be no more
filching on my watch.

75
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:15,909
- They must be kept in check!
- Spare the rod and spoil the child.

76
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,829
He didn't need to be beaten.

77
00:10:19,277 --> 00:10:20,467
It's not fair.

78
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:22,148
He's only small.

79
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:25,544
You dare to speak to the gentlemen?

80
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,829
If we had more food,
we wouldn't need to eat oakum.

81
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,656
He's beyond control!

82
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:33,029
Do you know what you are, Twist?

83
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,946
You are an ingrate.

84
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,349
Here you stand,

85
00:10:37,728 --> 00:10:41,789
bloated with the sins of pride,
of gluttony, of covetousness

86
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,909
when you should be on your knees,

87
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,656
praying to be forgiven!

88
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:50,509
- God sees thou, Twist.
- Amen.

89
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,749
Then he sees you, too.

90
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,509
We are the people who saved you, Twist.

91
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:05,790
When your own feckless mother
abandoned you at birth

92
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,069
by the simple expedient of dying,

93
00:11:09,038 --> 00:11:11,189
we fed you and clothed you,

94
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:14,807
taught you your letters, that you might
reap the benefits of your Bible.

95
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,984
Gave you a roof over your head, and...
and this is how you repay us?

96
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:21,309
She must have been a bad lot.

97
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:22,989
Not a shred of decency to her.

98
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:27,269
There's bad blood here, Sir.
And blood will out.

99
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,749
Apologise to us, immediately.

100
00:11:32,118 --> 00:11:34,327
Beg us for forgiveness for...

101
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:36,829
- all that you are.
- No!

102
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,634
I won't apologize.

103
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:41,549
I ain't done nothing wrong.

104
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:45,701
Get rid of him, Bumble.
He offends my sight!

105
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,323
You will hang, Twist.

106
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:53,519
You were born for it.

107
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,909
Your neck was made for the noose.
Do you hear me, boy?

108
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:01,389
You will dance in front
of a baying crowd...

109
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,069
... and then, maybe, you'll be sorry.

110
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,453
Pass the Stilton.

111
00:12:35,943 --> 00:12:38,827
BOY FOR SALE - 5 guineas
Apply Mr MUMBLE

112
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:41,977
Two guineas.

113
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,751
- Two?
- He's little.

114
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:46,362
Then he won't take up much room,
will he?

115
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,509
- Five is the price.
- Two.

116
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:51,851
Four.

117
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,403
And that's final. Take it or leave it.

118
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:55,947
Oliver!

119
00:12:57,353 --> 00:12:58,998
- Three.
- Two!

120
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,989
Taking the bread out of my mouth.

121
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:07,525
Follow.

122
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,426
He has a most melancholic countenance,

123
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,429
don't you think?

124
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:58,256
We can all be melancholic,
Mr Sowerberry, with

125
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:01,094
husbands urging thrift
upon their households

126
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:03,949
then spending good money
on workhouse strays.

127
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,466
If you want melancholy, Mr Sowerberry,
look to your poor wife.

128
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:08,909
He was a bargain, Madam.

129
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:12,468
He'll be very good for business
with a face like that.

130
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:15,391
Your poor wife who, because of thrift,

131
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,633
must attend church
with a shameful excuse for an'at!

132
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:21,189
Whispers and looks, Mr Sowerberry,
I hear them, I see them,

133
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:22,989
and they sting like a lash, Sir.

134
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:27,549
I dream of mere melancholy,
Mr Sowerberry. I dream of it.

135
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:30,909
Melancholy would be a merciful escape

136
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,429
from the deep rut of humiliation and
despair your loyal wife finds herself in

137
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:37,029
from being required
by thrift to dress as a pauper!

138
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,749
You have many hats...

139
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,411
Forty at the last count.

140
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,829
You can only wear one at a time.

141
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:48,362
I endure it all, Sir.

142
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:53,189
The petty counting of hats, the...
The buying of paupers...

143
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:57,115
I endure it all
out of marital duty, Sir.

144
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,940
I'm worn to a shadow of my former self.

145
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,696
My nerves are shattered,
are they not, Charlotte?

146
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:05,293
- Yes, Missus!
- Oh, what does he care?

147
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:08,561
He cares for nothing
but coffins and bargains!

148
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,469
Never marry, Charlotte, never!

149
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,429
Your heart will be broken
and ground into tiny pieces

150
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,874
by cruel husbands who don't give
two hoots for a lady's sensibilities.

151
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:22,578
If it would restore
Mrs Sowerberry's wellbeing,

152
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,949
I will lift the embargo on hats.

153
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:29,029
For one week only.

154
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:31,116
Well...

155
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,109
You sleep here...

156
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,267
... under the counter.

157
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:41,153
- Charlotte?
- Yes, Missus?

158
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,234
No doubt he's crawling with fleas.

159
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:45,909
- Scrub him.
- Yes, Missus.

160
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,678
Fetch him the scraps
left down for Tinker.

161
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:50,829
Yes, Missus.

162
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,522
Boy? Work'us.

163
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,005
I'm talking to you, Work'us.

164
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,479
You want to be careful, Work'us,

165
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,949
when you're sleeping in
with all them coffins.

166
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:30,899
You want to be careful
of them what's dead, Work'us,

167
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,741
cos they come back to life
when it's dark.

168
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:35,875
Worms dripping out
of they eye-holes.

169
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:36,853
Noah!

170
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,816
What d'you think to that then,
Work'us?

171
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:42,146
My name's not Work'us.

172
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:44,808
My name's Oliver.

173
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,269
Work'us.

174
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:13,134
Did you think it was
the dead coming for you?

175
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:16,006
Yeah, you did.

176
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,672
Near crying, you was.

177
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:20,924
But it's just me.

178
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,164
- Noah?
- Coming!

179
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:29,983
You're under me.
I'm above you.

180
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:32,146
Understand?

181
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:38,717
- You're scared.
- No.

182
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,386
You should be.

183
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:17,525
- What's he doing down there?
- I don't know, Missus.

184
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,894
- Having a rest, maybe.
- Lovely hat, Missus.

185
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,004
Get up.
Stop lazing around.

186
00:18:27,944 --> 00:18:30,455
- Come along, Charlotte. Come along.
- Yes, Missus.

187
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,629
What's the matter?

188
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:38,922
- Can't you take a joke?
- I haven't done anything to you.

189
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:41,833
Why can't you just leave me alone?

190
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,178
But I don't want to leave you alone!

191
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:45,953
Poor little orphan.

192
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:48,297
No mother or father.

193
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,323
Only orphan ain't strictly true,

194
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,205
is it, Work'us?

195
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:59,629
Cos there must be
a father somewhere.

196
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:03,632
It's just your mother what's dead,
ain't it?

197
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:05,835
- You don't know anything.
- Don't I?

198
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,529
Heard the mister telling the missus.

199
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:10,785
He got it all off Bumble.

200
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,989
Mother with no wedding ring.

201
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:18,069
Means you're unwanted, Work'us.

202
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,091
Now, what that makes your mother?

203
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:23,116
A doxy.

204
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:25,814
Know what a doxy is?

205
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,859
Lifts her skirt for a few pennies.

206
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,426
Oh, just as well she died.

207
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,982
That's what your mother was.

208
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,704
Just a poxy doxy!

209
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,605
Don't you talk about her!
You don't know!

210
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,169
- Shut your mouth about my mother!
- He's gone mad!

211
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,309
I never done nothing!

212
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:56,269
- He just went for me!
- Get off me, get off!

213
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:58,909
In there! No! The lid, Charlotte!

214
00:19:59,204 --> 00:20:00,497
Let me out!

215
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:02,676
Let me out!

216
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:04,497
Let me out!

217
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,771
Charlotte, fetch Mr Bumble.

218
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:08,322
Run!

219
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:23,284
Went for me with a hammer!

220
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,615
- Oh, Noah!
- I was afeared for my life!

221
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,870
- He's a berserker!
- Frenzied, he was.

222
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:30,029
Eyes rolling and foaming at the mouth.

223
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:32,381
He's gone rather quiet now.

224
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,652
And this is what you feed him?

225
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,429
Then this is not madness, but meat.

226
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,401
Meat, madam! It is a fatal error!

227
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,967
Good gristle heats the blood,

228
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,772
boils the brain in the skull.

229
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:48,682
A scientifically proven fact.

230
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,591
You have been over-generous.

231
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,591
I hope you're content, Sowerberry!

232
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:55,911
- He doesn't seem to be mad now.
- No-one's listening to you, Sir

233
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:58,663
not now, not ever, not after this.

234
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,946
I've a body beginning to niff

235
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:02,869
that requires a lined box.

236
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,231
I need that coffin
as a matter of urgency.

237
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,862
He'll slaughter us all!
It'll be me first! With a chisel!

238
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,109
Oh, my poor Noah! My angel!

239
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,429
You will all be safe with me.

240
00:21:13,185 --> 00:21:17,268
I shall give him a whipping
he will never forget.

241
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,734
You hear me in there, Twist?

242
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:23,253
I'll take the skin off your back!

243
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,936
Release the miscreant.

244
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:32,509
Gone.

245
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:02,069
There was only one boy
born in that month

246
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,920
ten years ago, Mr Monks.

247
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,829
Birthed in this very place,
to an Agnes Leeford.

248
00:24:08,383 --> 00:24:09,781
Oliver Twist.

249
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,127
I named the boy myself.

250
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,360
It is considered
I have a great gift with names.

251
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:20,523
The young girl died
of the childbed fever.

252
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,967
One of our trusties was midwife.

253
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:26,553
I'll fetch her for you.

254
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:42,499
I don't remember nothing, Mrs Corney.

255
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:44,583
Nothing at all?

256
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,510
The boy's mother say anything to you?

257
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:52,829
Oh, you're about
as much use as a sick headache,

258
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,085
you are. Coughing on us. Get out.

259
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,604
The boy's gone from here now. Ran away.

260
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:07,153
We nurtured a viper
in our bosom in Oliver Twist, Sir.

261
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,666
Caused a riot, Sir, locally.

262
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,309
Very violent.

263
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:14,449
Destroyed several coffins
and a splendid hat.

264
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,448
I myself sustained serious injury
to my buttock.

265
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:23,109
Sitting without several cushions
causes the most terrible hangwish.

266
00:25:25,951 --> 00:25:28,256
No, Sir. Not the ledger, Sir.

267
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:31,459
Parish property, Sir.

268
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:34,346
More than my job's
worth to let you take it.

269
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:41,891
But the boy could be anywhere,

270
00:25:42,312 --> 00:25:45,590
but his sort always
winds up back in trouble.

271
00:25:46,072 --> 00:25:48,669
Mr Bumble and I might hear some news.

272
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:51,513
Perhaps Sir might like
to leave an address?

273
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:20,394
All right, me covey? What's the racket?

274
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,907
- What?
- The racket, covey.

275
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:26,419
The row. The old salt water.

276
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:29,384
- What's the matter, then?
- Nothing.

277
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,820
Hold up, covey, why you dashin'off?

278
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:33,986
- I don't know who you are!
- Who I am!

279
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,369
Well, that depends

280
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:37,640
if you're a beak or a peeler, don't it?

281
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:38,605
What?

282
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,430
And you obviously ain't
neither of them, is ya?

283
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,189
Jack Hawkins is me given,
though I'm best known

284
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:46,835
round these parts as the Artful Dodger.

285
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:49,451
You can call me Dodge.

286
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:53,166
- Oliver Twist.
- Just arrived, have yer?

287
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:55,361
- All on yer tod?
- My tod?

288
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:57,629
Your own, Oliver. Tod is on your own.

289
00:28:58,058 --> 00:28:59,577
You is green, ain't ya?

290
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:02,043
Don't know nothin'about nothin'.

291
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:06,674
Dirty mare! Why don't you look first?

292
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:09,641
- Might have messed me threads!
- Up yours!

293
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:13,716
Some people, eh, Oliver?
No bleedin'manners.

294
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,934
- Got somewhere to stay?
- No.

295
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:22,231
I knows this gent,
a very kindly old soul,

296
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:24,878
what you might describe
as one of nature's...

297
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:26,336
philanthropists.

298
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:28,803
He has a place, it's where I kip.

299
00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:30,469
Might take you in.

300
00:29:31,527 --> 00:29:34,009
Got to be careful.
Being as how this old gent

301
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:37,076
is so tender-hearted,
all sorts could try their luck.

302
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,691
But I'll do me best for ya

303
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:40,872
and that's all I can do, ain't it?

304
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:42,458
Thanks, Dodger.

305
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,300
- Dodge.
- Come on, mate.

306
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,707
Got you a live one, Fagey.

307
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,192
Hello, my dear.

308
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:51,047
He don't know what to do with it.

309
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:54,250
It's a sausage, Oliver. You eat it.

310
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,418
- The whole thing?
- Green.

311
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:58,659
Green as a cabbage. Ain't got a clue.

312
00:30:58,794 --> 00:31:00,185
The whole thing, my dear.

313
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:02,749
What about you?

314
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,509
Do you want to share?

315
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:06,410
He don't eat 'em. Ain't kosher.

316
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:10,260
The pig and I
are not boon companions, my dear.

317
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:14,509
Thank you for the offer though.
Eat, eat.

318
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,228
Look at him, he loves it.

319
00:31:27,378 --> 00:31:29,559
You fill your boots, Nolly.

320
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:30,869
Nolly?

321
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,243
As in, short for Oliver, ain't it?

322
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:35,349
Got to have a moniker,
now we're muckers.

323
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:37,129
Like me being Dodger.

324
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:38,549
See him?

325
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,888
That's Handles on account of, well...

326
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:42,810
speaks for itself, don't it?

327
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:45,216
And that's Pearly,
cos his teeth is knackered.

328
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:47,411
Show him yer railings, Pearly.

329
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:50,249
And now you is Nolly.

330
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,452
Didn't you never have a nickname before?

331
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,009
No, never.

332
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:57,009
What kind of company you been keeping?

333
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,686
No kind of company at all,
by the look of him.

334
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,510
Nancy!

335
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:08,021
Let her in!

336
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,767
Dodge, sort him a bed.

337
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,989
- All right, Spike.
- All right, Nance.

338
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,251
A nice woman.

339
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,200
He's taking a right shine to you.

340
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:24,065
Nancy, my dear.

341
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,053
He wants top whack for these.

342
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:29,331
Does he indeed? Does he indeed?

343
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,937
Oh, you, what have I said?

344
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,433
Take your hat off when you're eating

345
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,642
or you'll never mix
with the gentry, will ya?

346
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:46,674
- Care of.
- Mine.

347
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:49,517
- Who's this, then?
- Found him today.

348
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,589
Oliver.
Nolly.

349
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:56,529
Oliver Nolly? Oliver Nolly?!

350
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:58,093
That's a funny name, ain't it?

351
00:32:58,228 --> 00:32:59,732
You won't get yourself a girl

352
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,379
if she's going to be called
Mrs Nolly. Will ya?

353
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:05,033
Well, Oliver Nolly, my name is Nancy.

354
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:09,002
- Do you want a seat, Miss Nancy?
- Miss!

355
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,904
You don't call her miss
and give her your seat,

356
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:16,202
she ain't no miss,
she ain't all posh, she's just Nancy.

357
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:19,081
You shut up, you!
If wants to call me Miss, he can.

358
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:22,709
Well, ta ever so, Oliver.

359
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:26,789
I don't mind if I do...
rest my feet for a moment.

360
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:30,746
Yeah, you're a bit of a gent, you, hmm?

361
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:32,521
Very considerate.

362
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:35,393
More than can be said for this lot.

363
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:37,776
They're nickel.

364
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:39,167
Plate.

365
00:33:39,694 --> 00:33:41,867
And I'm paying over the odds as it is,

366
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:44,269
and that's only because
you and I go back, my dear.

367
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:46,868
I'm the one
that has to give him these pennies.

368
00:33:47,036 --> 00:33:50,344
You might want to think
about that sometime, my dear.

369
00:33:53,247 --> 00:33:54,111
Right.

370
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,633
Soppy cow.

371
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:04,559
See you again, Oliver.

372
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:07,149
- Bye, boys!
- Bye, Nance!

373
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,981
She's a good'un, is Nance.

374
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,507
Me and her, we're like that.

375
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:25,325
Bill, stop it,
he ain't got it, let him go.

376
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,947
Bill, stop it, you're choking him!

377
00:34:30,098 --> 00:34:32,149
Get off me! Ah! Give me what's mine!

378
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,349
Stop it.
Put him down or you'll do for him.

379
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,749
- You'll swing for murder, Bill.
- For him? I should get a medal.

380
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:44,282
Let go of him.
He'll give you your money.

381
00:34:44,432 --> 00:34:45,951
Just let go.

382
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:49,034
I don't want to lose my man over this,
do I, darlin'?

383
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:53,551
Come on, Bill. Bill, let him go.

384
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:56,589
Bill, let him go. Bill!

385
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:11,108
You never flamin' learn, do you?

386
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:12,491
Get the coin.

387
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,446
I'll get it, I'll get it.

388
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:25,069
What you starin' at?

389
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:30,229
I'll knock your eyes out your head,
you keep starin'.

390
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:33,605
- Oliver, go back to bed.
- I heard you.

391
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,749
I was worried that you were scared.

392
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:40,935
What were you doing to him?

393
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:44,134
There ain't nothing
to worry about, Oliver.

394
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,916
No-one's scared. It's a game.

395
00:35:47,171 --> 00:35:48,359
Bit of a laugh.

396
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,709
Ain't it, Fagin? It's a bit of a laugh.

397
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:54,449
That's right, Nolly, my dear.

398
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,309
I had a bit of pie

399
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,015
lodged in my gullet.

400
00:35:58,182 --> 00:36:01,867
Mr Sikes here was helping me
to shake it loose.

401
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,882
Unorthodox, yes, but effective.

402
00:36:06,273 --> 00:36:08,273
He's still lookin' at me.

403
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,672
What you lookin' at me for?

404
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:13,251
He's new, Bill!

405
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:16,078
He don't know.

406
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:19,551
Brand-new this very day.
How could he know, eh?

407
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,237
Look at the dial on it.

408
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:29,801
Proper innocent.

409
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,462
Say,'I never saw nothing, Your Honour.'

410
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,311
I never saw nothing, Your Honour.

411
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,465
Do that to me again

412
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,337
and I will drag
your guts out with a hook.

413
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:51,638
Say it again.

414
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:54,749
I never saw nothing, Your Honour.

415
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:58,560
I like you.

416
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,429
Bullseye!

417
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:08,869
Either you're brave,

418
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,055
or wrong-headed.

419
00:37:12,102 --> 00:37:15,355
- Maybe a bit of both, eh?
- You coming or you staying?

420
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:29,469
- Are you all right?
- Go back to sleep, Nolly.

421
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,636
I know, Ezekiel, I know.

422
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,862
But I must bide my time.

423
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:53,573
Watch and wait.

424
00:37:55,344 --> 00:37:58,306
God will provide, Ezekiel.

425
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:02,802
'God will provide.'

426
00:38:17,696 --> 00:38:18,749
Very flash.

427
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:21,470
You cut a very fine figure, Nolly.

428
00:38:21,651 --> 00:38:23,863
You sure I can keep these, Mr Fagin?

429
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:25,442
I can't pay you.

430
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:28,825
Small details, my dear.
Small details.

431
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:35,484
- You've got a lot of handkerchiefs.
- Yes,

432
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:38,442
pretty, ain't they?

433
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:39,901
Handsome.

434
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:43,179
Put one in your pocket...

435
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,465
Just for a moment.

436
00:38:45,905 --> 00:38:47,499
- In my pocket?
- Yes.

437
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,401
See what it feels like
to be a gentleman.

438
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:54,702
Where's all the others?

439
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:58,371
They're all out grafting, my dear.

440
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,429
- Working.
- Doing what?

441
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:02,109
This and that.

442
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:04,980
Turning a quid,

443
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,160
earning a crust.

444
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:08,980
As we all must,

445
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,626
my dear, to put food on the table.

446
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,498
Then, I'll graft too.

447
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,826
Perhaps, my dear, perhaps.

448
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:18,736
Lookin your pocket.

449
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:24,705
How'd you do that?

450
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,916
Like many things in life,

451
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,938
Nolly, it's easy when you know how.

452
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:34,180
Eat, eat, eat, eat.

453
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:37,969
I have errands to run.

454
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:51,381
He hit someone with a coffin lid?

455
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:52,937
Unusual!

456
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,757
Why?

457
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,771
This geezer mouthed off'
gainst his dead mum.

458
00:39:57,951 --> 00:39:59,154
Eats away at him see,

459
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:01,515
his dead mum, who she was,

460
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:04,029
never knew her,
he don't even know her name.

461
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:06,267
But anyone mouths off'gainst her,

462
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:07,975
he goes bonkers.

463
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:09,426
Tell yer,

464
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:12,005
give him a couple of fried eggs,
you get his life story.

465
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:13,828
My ear holes are throbbin'.

466
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,561
- A blabber?
- No chance.

467
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:18,432
Code of the workhouse.

468
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,177
See all, say now,

469
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,229
else someone gets a beating.

470
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,029
He'll keep close, it's all he knows.

471
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:28,056
A workhouse runaway.

472
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:31,121
Don't I always spot 'em for yer, Fagey?

473
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,872
- Ain't I got the knack?
- Oh, you do, Dodger.

474
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:37,989
You have an unerring instinct.

475
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:41,384
You have the knack, my dear.

476
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:58,353
- You're going to teach me the graft?
- That's right.

477
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,624
What is the graft?

478
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,572
Well, that's what I'm going
to teach you, ain't it?

479
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,000
And I'm the best.

480
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,406
You learn from me, you won't go wrong.

481
00:41:07,557 --> 00:41:09,963
I'm like the bleedin' maestro
of the graft.

482
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,749
Everyone says.

483
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,302
Basic rules are...

484
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,309
Got to have your wits about ya.

485
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,324
Be quick on your feet.

486
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:21,234
Light with your fingers.

487
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,166
And keep your eyes peeled for marks.

488
00:41:24,347 --> 00:41:27,021
- Marks?
- Don't ask questions, Nolly,

489
00:41:27,775 --> 00:41:30,509
just watch. There's one.

490
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,683
Asking for it.

491
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,013
Watch and learn.

492
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:40,276
Anything kicks off,
'ave it on your toes.

493
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:06,510
My money! Stop that boy!

494
00:42:07,488 --> 00:42:08,488
Grab him!

495
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,690
No, no, not that one, the other boy!

496
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:15,119
Watch where you're going!

497
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:21,309
Stop him! Stop him!

498
00:42:21,614 --> 00:42:23,306
Oh, Edward!

499
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:26,269
They're chasing the wrong boy!

500
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,469
Idiot!!!

501
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,578
First time out and he gets pinched!

502
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:58,468
- Where have they taken him?
- Court sessions.

503
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:04,109
You'd better get down there, Fagin.

504
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,509
- Me?
- If he peaches on us,

505
00:43:07,772 --> 00:43:10,547
you'll dangle same as me.

506
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:12,820
Get down there,

507
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:16,158
at least then we'll have fair warning.

508
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,869
Weren't nothing I could do, Mr Sikes.

509
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:41,309
Transport him to the colonies.

510
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:42,895
Who's next?

511
00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:47,144
If you please, Mr Fang, your Honour Sir,

512
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:48,549
pickpocket.

513
00:43:48,811 --> 00:43:50,775
Took a gentleman's wallet
a mere hour ago.

514
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:52,669
Name.

515
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:55,982
Speak up, for the love of God.

516
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:57,053
What?

517
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,147
He said,'Oliver Twist, Sir.'

518
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:03,831
Pickpocket. Blight upon our city.

519
00:44:04,383 --> 00:44:07,195
A plague visited on our citizens.

520
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:10,149
- Worse than sewer rats.
- It wasn't me.

521
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:11,709
Oh, who was it, then...

522
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,669
Then you acted alone,

523
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,269
from base and venal instincts.

524
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:23,866
All that is left for me
to do is to pass sentence.

525
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:24,814
Prison

526
00:44:25,235 --> 00:44:26,679
or the colonies...

527
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:29,250
or...

528
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:32,784
How many have I sent
to the gallows this week?

529
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:35,509
22. But it's only Tuesday.

530
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:41,946
Simple. Hanging it is.

531
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,208
Oliver Twist,

532
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,599
you have been found guilty
of the crime of...

533
00:44:47,748 --> 00:44:48,981
Stop!

534
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:53,629
- You have the wrong boy!
- You're too late!

535
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:54,909
I sent ahead!

536
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:57,923
I came as fast as I could.

537
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:03,898
- That is the wrong boy!
- I'm passing sentence, Sir.

538
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,658
And wrong boy or not,

539
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:08,269
this is a court of law
and justice must be done.

540
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:12,229
You will be hanged by your neck

541
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:14,634
until you are dead,

542
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,629
and your mortal remains
shall be left to rot

543
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:19,583
in the common pit.

544
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,477
May God have mercy
on your vile and miserable soul.

545
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:45,450
Oliver?

546
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:50,106
Good, he's awake.

547
00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:53,295
- You scared him, Mrs Bedwin.
- Am I dead?

548
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:56,189
- Oh, poor boy.
- Am I dead? Where am I?

549
00:45:56,814 --> 00:45:59,078
- Who are you?
- I'm Rose.

550
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:02,269
And you're not dead, Oliver.
You're alive.

551
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:06,341
And you're safe now. You're safe.

552
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:17,131
Mrs Bedwin, how does the boy?

553
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:20,151
Much better, Sir.
He's got some appetite.

554
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:22,795
Just about took the pattern
off the plate.

555
00:46:23,095 --> 00:46:25,276
Nice to have my good food appreciated,

556
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:26,765
that's what I say.

557
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,381
Lizzie will serve your lamb.

558
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:32,581
I've found some old clothes for Oliver.

559
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:38,085
Uncle, may I be excused?

560
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:56,189
I hope you scrubbed behind your ears,
young man,

561
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:58,462
because I'll be checking.

562
00:46:58,778 --> 00:47:01,123
Now, I brought this for you.

563
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:02,949
It's a bit big,

564
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:04,955
but at least it's clean.

565
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:18,692
It's all right.

566
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:20,549
It don't hurt.

567
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,849
Let me help you.

568
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:35,769
These are fiddly, aren't they?

569
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:56,041
I'm pleased to see
you much recovered, Oliver.

570
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,829
I hope you will continue
to grow stronger.

571
00:48:00,397 --> 00:48:01,886
Thank you, Sir.

572
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,735
And thank you for speaking
for me at the court.

573
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:07,991
Well, that was nothing.

574
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,329
Mrs Bedwin? Is he cross with me?

575
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:31,282
No, Mr Brownlow's not cross.
It's just his way,

576
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,387
so don't you mind about him.

577
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:36,244
He never used to be like that, though.

578
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:38,758
He was always a proud man but

579
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:41,736
kind and generous,

580
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:45,302
and, oh, the music and laughter

581
00:48:45,482 --> 00:48:47,648
that used to be in this house.

582
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:50,024
But there was a tragedy,

583
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:52,502
and he's never been the same since,

584
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:56,021
and I'm here to tell you
that who's worked for him

585
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,291
these 40 years.

586
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:00,397
Precious little laughter now

587
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:03,230
and he can't stand to hear the piano.

588
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,829
Oh, he's still kind,

589
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:08,389
but it's all locked up tight.

590
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:11,116
Blames himself, you see.

591
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:15,349
Not a day goes by when
he doesn't curse himself.

592
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:18,822
What was the tragedy?

593
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,381
The old story, Oliver. Love.

594
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:25,057
Two people fell in love

595
00:49:25,343 --> 00:49:27,569
and maybe it wasn't approved of,

596
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:30,726
maybe eyebrows would have been raised,

597
00:49:31,538 --> 00:49:33,463
but to see them together,

598
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:37,556
plain as day it was real, true love,

599
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:40,098
and it should have been joyful

600
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:43,451
and all about weddings and celebrations,

601
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:51,408
but instead it ended up in heartbreak,
grief, loss...

602
00:49:54,229 --> 00:49:55,029
Why?

603
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:59,581
Oh, listen to me, gossiping on.

604
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,149
I've said too much for your young ears.

605
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:05,904
Now,

606
00:50:06,926 --> 00:50:09,166
what shall we have for pudding tonight?

607
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:12,232
Apple pie or cherry?

608
00:50:13,832 --> 00:50:14,685
Both.

609
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:20,936
Uncle Robert?

610
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:27,523
- Come on.
- Is he really your uncle?

611
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,463
No. I call him that,

612
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,206
but Mr Brownlow's my guardian.

613
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:32,755
He looked after us,

614
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:35,898
my sister and I,
because we didn't have any family.

615
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:37,748
No parents.

616
00:50:38,154 --> 00:50:39,349
Where's your sister?

617
00:50:42,364 --> 00:50:43,955
She's not here.

618
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:49,820
# Abide with me #

619
00:50:49,955 --> 00:50:55,210
# Fast falls the eventide #

620
00:50:55,646 --> 00:51:00,416
# The darkness deepens #

621
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:04,345
# Lord with me abide #

622
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:08,602
# Who like thyself #

623
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:13,218
# My guide and stay can be #

624
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:18,834
# Through cloud and sunshine #

625
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:23,481
# Oh abide with me. #

626
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,572
Rose?

627
00:51:34,031 --> 00:51:36,147
Let's play something cheerful.

628
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:50,747
- Oh, Sir. I'll tell them to stop.
- No, no, no, don't.

629
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:56,469
Rose plays very well, Sir.

630
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:01,271
She does.

631
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:12,437
- We'll have to fetch him back.
- Why?

632
00:52:12,723 --> 00:52:15,610
He didn't peach on us in the court,
he won't peach on us now.

633
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:18,046
But in front of the Beak, you're scared.

634
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:20,211
Your voice box is paralysed.

635
00:52:20,362 --> 00:52:22,181
Where he is now, who knows?

636
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:24,690
If he was square ***,
he could spill.

637
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,589
- Sing like a bird.
- Well, he won't.

638
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:29,517
Leave him where he is, Fagin.

639
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:32,028
He's got a chance. Just let him be.

640
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:37,309
But the risk,
my dear, the risk is too high.

641
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:40,201
Well, I don't want no part in it.

642
00:52:40,352 --> 00:52:42,502
You'll do as you're told.

643
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,127
- Will I?
- You will,

644
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:48,925
if you don't want to
feel the back of my hand.

645
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:52,596
Bill, there's no need
for backs of hands,

646
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,669
no need at all. No.

647
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:57,649
And Nancy, it's all very simple.

648
00:52:57,784 --> 00:52:59,746
You wouldn't have to do
hardly anything at all.

649
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:01,310
Hardly a thing.

650
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:15,369
- Women.
- What can you do?

651
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:23,484
'Oliver Twist.

652
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,147
'My dear Master Twist,

653
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:32,343
'should you wish to solve the mystery

654
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:34,343
'of your sweet sainted mother's identity

655
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:36,371
'and learn of her flawless character

656
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:39,183
'and good deeds then
come to Golden Lane today.

657
00:53:39,389 --> 00:53:40,457
'I will be waiting.

658
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,732
'I urge you to tell no-one.

659
00:53:42,912 --> 00:53:44,732
'I remain your faithful servant

660
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:46,265
'and secret friend.'

661
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:49,785
I never paid for your book.

662
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:52,235
- What's that?
- Well, the day

663
00:53:52,386 --> 00:53:54,371
they charged Oliver with being a thief.

664
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:56,085
Seems I'm the thief.

665
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,509
And the poor bookseller
would like to be paid.

666
00:53:58,843 --> 00:54:01,098
Mrs Bedwin, would you call for a boy

667
00:54:01,335 --> 00:54:03,749
- to take the money round?
- Let me take it.

668
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,549
I'm a boy. Please, let me take it.

669
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:09,388
You?

670
00:54:09,651 --> 00:54:11,434
You've done so much for me.

671
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:13,660
I'd like to do something to repay you.

672
00:54:14,367 --> 00:54:15,669
Please let me take it.

673
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:27,287
Oliver!

674
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:30,002
Nancy.

675
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,981
You look really well, Oliver.
You look smashing.

676
00:54:37,913 --> 00:54:40,379
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had a little bit to drink.

677
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,424
Dutch courage. Make me brave.

678
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:44,410
What d'you need to be brave for?

679
00:54:46,472 --> 00:54:48,309
You just come round the corner with me

680
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:50,276
- and I'll tell you.
- Nancy, I can't.

681
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:51,886
- I'm meeting someone.
- No,

682
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:53,676
you got to come with me.

683
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:54,869
Nancy?

684
00:54:57,509 --> 00:54:59,524
Are you the secret friend?

685
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:04,038
You're going to find out
exactly what I am.

686
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:06,473
Come on, sweetheart.

687
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:16,066
Get off of me!

688
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:19,736
- Get off of me!
- Oh, don't he wriggle!

689
00:55:21,812 --> 00:55:24,609
I hate you, I hate the lot of you!

690
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:26,834
Get off! Get off of me!

691
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:28,037
Stop it!

692
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,625
- Get off of me!
- Right. Oh, letters.

693
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,791
Ain't you gone up in the world, son?

694
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:36,137
That's it, my boy, jab and weave,

695
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:37,837
jab and weave, Nolly.

696
00:55:37,957 --> 00:55:39,566
Keep your dukes up, son!

697
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:41,822
Bill, Bill, Bill, enough! Enough!

698
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:49,297
Let me out! Let me out of here!

699
00:55:49,418 --> 00:55:50,621
Let me out!

700
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:52,367
Let me out of here!

701
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,337
I could cosh him, that'd shut him up.

702
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,532
He'll tire soon enough, Bill.

703
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,183
Anyway, who's here to hear?

704
00:55:58,303 --> 00:56:00,649
- Let me out of here!
- Good work, Nance.

705
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:03,637
Let me out! Let me out of here!

706
00:56:09,638 --> 00:56:12,225
Let me out, let me out!

707
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:13,909
Let me out of here!

708
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:18,265
Get off of me.

709
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:21,726
Fagin's up to something.

710
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:24,019
He's got something going on, I know it.

711
00:56:56,477 --> 00:56:59,018
He never went to the bookseller's.

712
00:56:59,935 --> 00:57:01,740
Something must have happened.

713
00:57:02,926 --> 00:57:04,445
He had money in his pocket,

714
00:57:04,565 --> 00:57:06,279
and good clothes on his back.

715
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:08,836
- Just a thief after all.
- No, Uncle, not Oliver.

716
00:57:08,956 --> 00:57:10,505
We were taken in by a thief.

717
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:12,389
- Uncle...
- Rose, I don't want to hear

718
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:15,584
another word on the matter!
Not another word!

719
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:30,189
Out for the count.

720
00:57:31,932 --> 00:57:33,783
Dead to the world.

721
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:38,974
Here's the boy. Oliver Twist.

722
00:57:39,921 --> 00:57:41,789
What would you have me
do with him,

723
00:57:42,051 --> 00:57:43,658
Mr Monks?

724
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:48,072
I want him dead.

725
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:52,538
I want him wiped off
the face of the earth.

726
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:24,251
Nolly!

727
01:00:42,483 --> 01:00:43,715
Good morning!

728
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:51,102
Good morning, Mr Monks.

729
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:56,577
I thought we could
speak more freely here.

730
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:58,939
I hope you don't find it too squalid.

731
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:00,232
Squalid?

732
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:02,863
No, I rather like it.

733
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:10,507
This is fraying, sir.

734
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:15,923
- I hadn't noticed.
- Well, it is.

735
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:18,345
We could do with some new table linens.

736
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:21,478
They've not been replaced in,
I don't know how long.

737
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:23,845
I need to do some
shopping for this house.

738
01:01:23,965 --> 01:01:27,063
Whatever you think best, Mrs Bedwin.

739
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:28,387
I'll go today.

740
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:30,312
There's no time like the present.

741
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:32,342
Might I accompany you, Mrs Bedwin?

742
01:01:32,582 --> 01:01:34,909
If you're going to the haberdasher's?

743
01:01:36,399 --> 01:01:37,949
If you permit, Uncle?

744
01:01:38,576 --> 01:01:40,149
She'll be with me, sir.

745
01:01:45,222 --> 01:01:47,189
After breakfast, then, Miss Rose.

746
01:01:51,067 --> 01:01:52,586
Might I enquire

747
01:01:52,737 --> 01:01:54,909
why you wish the boy to be disposed of?

748
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:56,767
Is this some new sport

749
01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:59,744
that gentlemen are
pursuing these days, sir?

750
01:02:00,105 --> 01:02:02,634
Oh, Mr Fagin, let's not muddy the waters

751
01:02:02,754 --> 01:02:04,481
with reasons and motives.

752
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:07,171
- Very good, sir.
- The issue is clear.

753
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,757
He must hang.

754
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,719
It's easy enough to
get a pauper child hung.

755
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,460
Arrange it so that the boy is caught

756
01:02:15,595 --> 01:02:18,189
in a crime which guarantees the noose.

757
01:02:20,215 --> 01:02:22,170
It may take time.

758
01:02:23,094 --> 01:02:26,243
The right situation,
the right circumstances...

759
01:02:26,363 --> 01:02:28,242
I leave the intricacies to you.

760
01:02:28,362 --> 01:02:32,048
And, of course,
the personal risk to myself is...

761
01:02:32,393 --> 01:02:34,228
I understand, Mr Fagin.

762
01:02:34,469 --> 01:02:36,514
A life such as yours is
not one of leisure

763
01:02:36,664 --> 01:02:38,739
and ease.
A man such as yourself,

764
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:41,138
harried from place to place, jeered at,

765
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:42,469
treated with suspicion

766
01:02:42,732 --> 01:02:43,980
and contempt,

767
01:02:44,521 --> 01:02:45,905
you could do with a friend.

768
01:02:47,198 --> 01:02:48,989
I could be that friend.

769
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,474
And when the boy is cold

770
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,534
in a convict's grave,

771
01:02:55,798 --> 01:02:57,437
there will be more of these.

772
01:02:57,602 --> 01:02:58,985
More than you can count.

773
01:02:59,796 --> 01:03:01,150
Do we have a deal?

774
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:04,233
- We do, sir.
- Good day, Mr Fagin.

775
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,349
Good day to you, Mr Monks.

776
01:03:06,611 --> 01:03:08,774
And it is an honour and a pleasure

777
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:11,678
to associate with such a gentleman, sir.

778
01:03:21,914 --> 01:03:24,441
Come on, Nolly. 'Ave your scran.

779
01:03:24,621 --> 01:03:26,149
I brought it over special.

780
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:29,127
It's a sausage. You love a sausage.

781
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:32,719
Come on, Nolly,

782
01:03:32,992 --> 01:03:34,300
don't be like this.

783
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,045
I told you, if it kicks off

784
01:03:36,195 --> 01:03:38,109
when you're working,
'ave it on your toes.

785
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:40,727
I thought you was right behind me,
didn't I?

786
01:03:40,892 --> 01:03:43,549
How was I to know you'd
get grabbed by a Peeler?

787
01:03:45,228 --> 01:03:47,499
Next time, you'll know to run faster.

788
01:03:50,058 --> 01:03:51,667
They were kind to me.

789
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,498
And now they'll think I'm a thief.

790
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,513
They'll think I stole off've 'em!

791
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:58,349
What you worrying about them for?

792
01:03:58,611 --> 01:04:00,912
Rich people, they expect it.

793
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:01,909
Got plenty,

794
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:03,648
more than enough.

795
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:05,603
We wouldn't get it if we asked for it.

796
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:07,032
End up starving.

797
01:04:07,197 --> 01:04:08,619
So, we take.

798
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:10,694
And they won't think nothin' about yer,

799
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:12,484
cos they'll have forgot about yer.

800
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:15,040
So do us a favour and
leave it out with the strops

801
01:04:15,206 --> 01:04:17,552
cos you're starting
to give me the royal 'ump.

802
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,581
That's it, mate. Dig in, eh?

803
01:04:28,851 --> 01:04:31,754
Back where you belong.
With your muckers.

804
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:37,845
Be like that, then!
See if I care!

805
01:05:21,493 --> 01:05:22,493
Edward!

806
01:05:23,512 --> 01:05:27,357
- My dearest boy!
- Grandfather.

807
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,202
# Bene Israel... #

808
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:37,865
# Bene Israel... #

809
01:05:38,046 --> 01:05:40,361
Never trust the goyim,

810
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:43,128
Ezekiel, never!

811
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:48,118
Mr Monks wants no
blood on his hands,

812
01:05:49,261 --> 01:05:52,855
But as certain as our
people ate bitter herbs,

813
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:56,192
he will put the same
cravat around my neck

814
01:05:56,433 --> 01:05:59,519
as he would around the boy's.

815
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:04,769
We must ask ourselves, Ezekiel...

816
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:07,671
why would a man of means

817
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:10,423
want the boy dead? Hm?

818
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:14,349
Why does a man of means, we ask...

819
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:18,173
Who wears a crested ring,

820
01:06:18,323 --> 01:06:20,594
who carries a cane topped in silver,

821
01:06:20,729 --> 01:06:23,294
whose boots are of
the softest kidskin...

822
01:06:25,298 --> 01:06:28,014
Want a workhouse runaway

823
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:30,109
to dangle through the trap door?

824
01:06:36,682 --> 01:06:40,564
I smell a mystery, Ezekiel.

825
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:48,144
If Mr Monks will pay handsomely

826
01:06:48,294 --> 01:06:50,355
to lose Oliver Twist,

827
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:52,881
then it follows that someone else

828
01:06:53,016 --> 01:06:55,189
will pay handsomely to find him.

829
01:06:57,795 --> 01:06:59,373
We have watched

830
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,285
and we have waited, Ezekiel,

831
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:05,693
for God to provide, and he has!

832
01:07:09,257 --> 01:07:13,443
I knew there was something
special about young Nolly.

833
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:15,580
I will keep him from danger

834
01:07:15,709 --> 01:07:17,751
and deliver him safely as his protector.

835
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:20,005
There will be no blood on these hands,

836
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:23,070
oh, no, only a crested
ring on my finger.

837
01:07:23,222 --> 01:07:25,905
The only cravat around my neck

838
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,959
will be of finest silk,
and you, Ezekiel...

839
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:33,414
...you will have a gilded cage!

840
01:07:39,294 --> 01:07:41,425
I was sorry to leave you so suddenly

841
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:43,641
when you sent me to the court to

842
01:07:43,895 --> 01:07:45,476
plead the pickpocket's case. I

843
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:47,637
must have gone to the wrong sessions.

844
01:07:47,766 --> 01:07:49,725
And then I received word that

845
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,060
may have helped our search
and I had to pursue it.

846
01:07:55,932 --> 01:07:57,146
I am only sorry I

847
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:59,738
do not have happier news to return with.

848
01:08:00,489 --> 01:08:01,710
Grandfather, this...

849
01:08:01,971 --> 01:08:02,920
search

850
01:08:03,307 --> 01:08:06,349
has gone on for such a time.

851
01:08:07,786 --> 01:08:09,947
I am concerned about your health.

852
01:08:10,512 --> 01:08:12,397
No, I won't give up.

853
01:08:13,165 --> 01:08:17,374
So long as you are
happy to act on my behalf.

854
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,922
Of course.
You shouldn't even need to ask.

855
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:21,304
Your compassion

856
01:08:21,456 --> 01:08:24,028
is a standard to which
I constantly aspire.

857
01:08:25,165 --> 01:08:28,469
Would that I had been more
compassionate ten years ago.

858
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,669
We will find Agnes and her child.

859
01:08:35,957 --> 01:08:38,448
I am very proud of you.

860
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,108
Your father would have
been very proud of you.

861
01:08:43,564 --> 01:08:45,853
Fine son for a man to have.

862
01:09:35,461 --> 01:09:36,742
Dodger...

863
01:09:41,346 --> 01:09:42,908
Nolly, my dear?

864
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:45,589
He shut me in...

865
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:47,669
and he's taken Nolly.

866
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,659
Let's get us a little drink, Fagin, eh?

867
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,301
Thank you.

868
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,149
Stop picking at yourself,

869
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,629
yeah, or I will give you something
to really bleat about.

870
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,709
There was no call to
put the cosh on Dodger, Bill.

871
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:20,760
It'll do 'im good.

872
01:10:21,312 --> 01:10:22,949
Death to all judges.

873
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:25,915
L'Chayim!

874
01:10:30,306 --> 01:10:32,346
Where is young Nolly, then?

875
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:35,945
Don't you fret about him, he's cushty.

876
01:10:37,411 --> 01:10:39,189
What've you got going on,
then, Fagin?

877
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:42,669
Nothing.

878
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:46,379
If that boy was gonna blow on us,

879
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:49,149
he'd have done it in court.

880
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:50,876
But you...

881
01:10:51,532 --> 01:10:52,953
had to get him back,

882
01:10:53,258 --> 01:10:55,029
stick him in a cellar, and guard him

883
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:59,540
- like the Crown bleedin' jewels.
- Bill, please! Please!

884
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:02,189
So suspicious and distrustful.

885
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,239
I just wanted to make certain

886
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:07,229
that the boy wouldn't peach on us.
That's all.

887
01:11:08,613 --> 01:11:09,620
Right.

888
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:12,849
Then you won't mind if I...

889
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:15,109
use him for a spot of business, then?

890
01:11:15,385 --> 01:11:17,816
- A spot of business?
- Drum I've had my eye on.

891
01:11:18,759 --> 01:11:20,802
He'll come in handy. He's little, see.

892
01:11:20,922 --> 01:11:23,269
- They can get in anywhere.
- I'll go with you Mr Sikes.

893
01:11:23,434 --> 01:11:26,229
I'm handy. Go on. ***.

894
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:28,829
You want to take the boy with you?

895
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,288
Best way to stop him peaching on us

896
01:11:31,408 --> 01:11:32,898
is to make him one of us, hm?

897
01:11:36,018 --> 01:11:38,592
Unless of course there's some reason

898
01:11:38,745 --> 01:11:41,229
you don't want him
doing what he's meant for?

899
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:43,993
No, none at all.

900
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:47,989
Although I would like to see the boy.

901
01:11:49,299 --> 01:11:51,131
To check on his wellbeing.

902
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,113
Out of a genuine
fondness I have for him,

903
01:11:54,254 --> 01:11:56,389
as I do for all my boys, hm?

904
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,576
Oh, yeah.

905
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:10,069
Come on, then. Get home, Dodge.

906
01:12:52,293 --> 01:12:53,420
Excuse me...

907
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:56,297
I wonder if you can help us?
We're looking for a boy.

908
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:58,764
Hear that? She's looking for a boy.

909
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:02,874
How 'bout me, darlin'? Will I do?
Nah, you stick with me,

910
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,068
- I'll sort you right out.
- How dare you?!

911
01:13:07,347 --> 01:13:09,043
Oh, I don't fancy yours much,

912
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,016
she's a right old boiler!

913
01:13:11,356 --> 01:13:13,789
I'll have little Missy!
Come along, Miss Rose.

914
01:13:14,327 --> 01:13:17,192
- You've got me all sweaty now!
- Disgraceful!

915
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:24,629
Everything up to scratch, is it?

916
01:13:25,324 --> 01:13:27,755
He had a jacket. And now he don't.

917
01:13:28,001 --> 01:13:30,069
And boots. Where are his boots?

918
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:31,589
You got a drink out of 'em.

919
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:34,989
Anyhow,

920
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:37,997
boots make a noise. Bare feet

921
01:13:38,326 --> 01:13:39,469
don't make a whisper.

922
01:13:42,893 --> 01:13:44,431
All right, are you,

923
01:13:44,986 --> 01:13:47,663
- Nolly, my dear?
- Of course he's all right.

924
01:13:47,804 --> 01:13:49,624
Little 'un here's a scrapper.

925
01:13:50,117 --> 01:13:51,869
Caught him having a row with Dodger,

926
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,149
chucked a plate at him.

927
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:57,359
He's well able for himself...
Ain't yer, mate?

928
01:14:03,236 --> 01:14:04,430
A little scrapper.

929
01:14:05,313 --> 01:14:07,036
Proper little brawler.

930
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:12,189
Look at 'im!

931
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:15,953
Don't even flinch.

932
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:19,869
Why ain't you scared of me, boy?

933
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:23,669
I've seen worse than you.

934
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:27,989
Worse than me, eh?

935
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:33,330
There ain't no worse than me.

936
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:35,913
Just ain't.

937
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:40,904
I am the very worst.

938
01:14:41,798 --> 01:14:43,229
Bill, leave him!

939
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,933
All right, touchy!

940
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:48,751
I'm just having a laugh.

941
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,652
Right, you seen him.

942
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:55,531
You can trot off now.

943
01:14:56,693 --> 01:14:58,889
Gonna get me head down for a bit.

944
01:15:01,015 --> 01:15:03,410
Wake us up later, Nance, hm?

945
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:08,211
Don't go chucking
too much down your neck

946
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:10,549
and passing out yourself, you hear?

947
01:15:11,509 --> 01:15:12,509
I hear ya.

948
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,167
Moody mare.

949
01:15:25,011 --> 01:15:26,519
Nolly, my dear...

950
01:15:28,904 --> 01:15:31,048
This is very important.

951
01:15:31,381 --> 01:15:34,147
When you go out tonight with Mr Sikes,

952
01:15:34,299 --> 01:15:36,029
you must do exactly what he says.

953
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:37,798
Hm? Exactly.

954
01:15:39,169 --> 01:15:41,156
Mr Sikes is a most...

955
01:15:41,497 --> 01:15:43,204
intemperate man,

956
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:46,585
and we all want to see you
again in the morning,

957
01:15:46,851 --> 01:15:47,947
don't we?

958
01:15:48,452 --> 01:15:50,084
Understand, don't you?

959
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:52,490
Good boy.

960
01:16:06,509 --> 01:16:07,309
Sorry.

961
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:16,821
I wanted to leave you where you was,

962
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:18,429
cross my heart I did.

963
01:16:19,322 --> 01:16:21,909
I swear on everything.
I never wanted this.

964
01:16:23,593 --> 01:16:26,042
- I know.
- You do?

965
01:16:27,434 --> 01:16:29,295
You're not just saying that?

966
01:16:40,405 --> 01:16:42,343
I'll get your shoes cleaned.

967
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:44,926
Now upstairs with you, and get changed.

968
01:16:45,055 --> 01:16:46,922
I'll send up some hot water for you.

969
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:48,414
Thank you.

970
01:16:49,412 --> 01:16:51,942
Go on, Miss Rose,
before the master notices.

971
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:54,309
And you can mind your own, Lizzie!

972
01:17:00,339 --> 01:17:01,360
Miss Rose.

973
01:17:02,124 --> 01:17:02,924
Sir!

974
01:17:03,674 --> 01:17:05,987
My apologies.
I did not mean to make you jump.

975
01:17:06,139 --> 01:17:08,129
I wasn't expecting to see you.

976
01:17:09,702 --> 01:17:12,269
- What a pleasant surprise.
- The pleasure is all mine.

977
01:17:18,408 --> 01:17:21,069
A walk in the park. Mud.

978
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:23,385
The delights of nature.

979
01:17:23,832 --> 01:17:24,841
Yes, sir.

980
01:17:25,323 --> 01:17:27,178
Excuse me, I must get changed.

981
01:17:27,298 --> 01:17:28,229
Miss Rose?

982
01:17:29,457 --> 01:17:30,414
Sir?

983
01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:32,681
You do not ask if
my trip was profitable,

984
01:17:32,845 --> 01:17:35,663
if I have any news of
your sister and her child?

985
01:17:35,867 --> 01:17:37,269
- Oh, did you...?
- Sadly, no.

986
01:17:38,823 --> 01:17:40,109
But we live in hope.

987
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:43,033
Yes, sir.

988
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:15,130
I wasn't ***.

989
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,751
I wouldn't want to get you in trouble.

990
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,574
- Where would I go?
- True enough.

991
01:18:24,568 --> 01:18:26,223
Don't know what's in it.

992
01:18:26,651 --> 01:18:28,325
They said it was mutton, but

993
01:18:28,478 --> 01:18:30,028
it's more likely cat!

994
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:35,967
It smells nice, anyhow.

995
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:40,669
What did you get for
yourself today, Rose?

996
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:44,714
There were a couple of
very pretty pieces of lace.

997
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:46,577
I couldn't make up my mind.

998
01:18:46,718 --> 01:18:49,069
I'll return tomorrow with Mrs Bedwin.

999
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:51,869
I would be happy to go with you,
Miss Rose.

1000
01:18:52,214 --> 01:18:54,257
I could help you make your selection

1001
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:56,018
of which lace best suits you.

1002
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:57,469
Good idea, Edward!

1003
01:18:57,731 --> 01:19:00,509
Mrs Bedwin has enough
to keep her occupied.

1004
01:19:01,961 --> 01:19:03,370
Tomorrow then, Miss Rose.

1005
01:19:03,522 --> 01:19:05,975
- I shall look forward to it.
- I would be honoured

1006
01:19:06,095 --> 01:19:07,926
to have your company,
Mr Edward, but

1007
01:19:08,066 --> 01:19:10,110
I also require some items

1008
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,610
particular to a lady's wardrobe and...

1009
01:19:13,303 --> 01:19:14,630
I'm sure you appreciate it

1010
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:17,309
would be more seemly for
me to be accompanied by a woman.

1011
01:19:18,355 --> 01:19:19,564
Another time.

1012
01:19:23,339 --> 01:19:24,789
To you, Grandfather.

1013
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:26,669
To you, Miss Rose.

1014
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:30,356
And to those absent from us,

1015
01:19:31,322 --> 01:19:33,149
who, we pray, will return home soon.

1016
01:19:38,549 --> 01:19:40,565
Why were you rowing with Dodger?

1017
01:19:41,623 --> 01:19:44,188
Weren't his fault,
you know, running away.

1018
01:19:44,806 --> 01:19:47,507
- It's not that.
- What, then?

1019
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:51,429
- He told.
- Told what?

1020
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,589
It was all in the letter.

1021
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:56,197
The letter that got me back here.

1022
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,549
I can't read nor write,
Oliver, so I wouldn't know.

1023
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,592
It was about my mother.

1024
01:20:02,919 --> 01:20:05,062
Saying if I wanted
to find out about her,

1025
01:20:05,238 --> 01:20:07,080
I should come and meet someone

1026
01:20:07,491 --> 01:20:09,628
who could tell me what she was like.

1027
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:12,727
The only person I told
about her was Dodger,

1028
01:20:13,237 --> 01:20:14,749
cos I thought we was friends.

1029
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:17,447
And he told them.

1030
01:20:17,789 --> 01:20:18,589
Fagin,

1031
01:20:19,269 --> 01:20:20,162
Sikes.

1032
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:22,972
Told them my secret.

1033
01:20:25,678 --> 01:20:27,069
You don't tell on friends.

1034
01:20:28,605 --> 01:20:30,656
No. You don't.

1035
01:20:32,857 --> 01:20:36,269
- You never knew her, then?
- She died when I was born.

1036
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:38,829
I never knew mine neither.

1037
01:20:39,889 --> 01:20:42,554
- Don't you wanna find out?
- No, I don't.

1038
01:20:42,766 --> 01:20:44,349
Not one little bit.

1039
01:20:45,182 --> 01:20:46,156
I do.

1040
01:20:47,213 --> 01:20:50,229
You wouldn't have said anything,
would you?

1041
01:20:51,212 --> 01:20:53,079
You'd have kept it a secret.

1042
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:55,509
I would.

1043
01:21:00,109 --> 01:21:01,850
You know what I reckon?

1044
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:05,309
I reckon she was lovely.

1045
01:21:07,813 --> 01:21:09,211
And beautiful.

1046
01:21:10,135 --> 01:21:12,334
And gentle. That's what I reckon.

1047
01:21:13,281 --> 01:21:15,669
And you might not know her,
but she knows you.

1048
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:20,599
She's a star in the sky, darlin'.

1049
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:22,269
That's what she is.

1050
01:21:30,559 --> 01:21:32,109
I'd best wake Bill up.

1051
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:33,790
Nancy...

1052
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,547
I don't wanna do this.

1053
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:39,227
I don't wanna go anywhere with him.

1054
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,269
He'll take care of yer.

1055
01:21:42,618 --> 01:21:44,731
And the more useful you are to him,

1056
01:21:45,188 --> 01:21:47,103
the better care he'll take.

1057
01:21:52,599 --> 01:21:54,454
He ain't a bad man, Oliver.

1058
01:21:55,690 --> 01:21:57,149
He's just Bill.

1059
01:22:08,062 --> 01:22:10,473
Will we fetch the doctor, Mrs Corney?

1060
01:22:11,873 --> 01:22:13,629
What do you want
to go bothering him for?

1061
01:22:14,418 --> 01:22:15,790
She coughs blood.

1062
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:17,863
And how do we know she coughs it?

1063
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:20,368
She could've cut her arm
and put the blood on a rag.

1064
01:22:20,488 --> 01:22:22,072
Instead she coughs it.

1065
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:24,639
It's a well-known trick
deployed by malingerers.

1066
01:22:24,768 --> 01:22:26,508
Anything to avoid work.

1067
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:30,193
Put a poultice on her chest.
She'll be all right.

1068
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:32,309
Don't bother me again.

1069
01:22:47,945 --> 01:22:51,473
- Bit of a tight squeeze, isn't it, sir?
- Oh, it is, madam.

1070
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,411
We could be stuck here all night.

1071
01:22:54,567 --> 01:22:57,935
Now, if I just... wriggle a bit.

1072
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,160
There we are.

1073
01:23:01,116 --> 01:23:03,930
- Sorry, madam...
- Oh, never apologise, sir,

1074
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,777
for having an imposing
and masculine frame.

1075
01:23:12,428 --> 01:23:13,469
By damn, Bumble,

1076
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:15,927
she is a ripe plum,

1077
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:18,944
and yours for the plucking, sir.

1078
01:23:20,107 --> 01:23:22,944
Yours... for the plucking.

1079
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:33,922
If anyone should be going
out to work with Mr Sikes,

1080
01:23:34,157 --> 01:23:35,749
ain't Nolly, it's me.

1081
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,185
- I'm next in line.
- Hush, Dodge.

1082
01:23:38,337 --> 01:23:40,298
I mean, what's going on here, eh?

1083
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:42,270
I'm bein' passed over, Fagey.

1084
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:44,343
And it ain't right, I'm tellin' yer.

1085
01:23:44,463 --> 01:23:47,274
I'm keen. I'm mustard.
Got ambition, ain't I?

1086
01:23:47,649 --> 01:23:49,786
And I'm sat here, twiddling my thumbs

1087
01:23:49,927 --> 01:23:51,360
like an old woman.

1088
01:23:52,076 --> 01:23:53,626
And I'll tell Mr Sikes so,

1089
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:56,409
- straight to his face, I will.
- Dodger, my dear...

1090
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,675
- You see if I don't...
- Hush!

1091
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,221
Now, you get through this,

1092
01:25:09,374 --> 01:25:11,558
and let me through the front, hm?

1093
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:14,389
Don't take all night about it.

1094
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:28,141
Move yourself.

1095
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:37,644
- Mrs Carney...
- No, Sal, it's Molly.

1096
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:39,957
I got a poultice for your chest,

1097
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:42,094
- set you to rights.
- Mrs Corney...

1098
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:44,161
She ain't to be troubled.

1099
01:25:45,464 --> 01:25:47,429
I can't die without telling...

1100
01:25:47,730 --> 01:25:49,550
Who's talking about dying?

1101
01:25:50,137 --> 01:25:52,232
Try and be a bit cheerful, Sal.

1102
01:26:01,817 --> 01:26:03,100
The letter...

1103
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,029
The locket...

1104
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:08,985
'Oliver Twist...'

1105
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:54,700
- Move.
- What...?

1106
01:28:05,388 --> 01:28:07,936
It hurts, it hurts...

1107
01:28:08,089 --> 01:28:10,240
Shut your mouth or they'll have us...

1108
01:28:56,558 --> 01:28:58,808
Hush your mouth or I'll drown ya...

1109
01:30:20,313 --> 01:30:21,311
What?

1110
01:30:21,863 --> 01:30:24,575
Why are you so antsy?
Sitting up all night?

1111
01:30:26,537 --> 01:30:29,589
I'm merely relishing
the peace and quiet, my dear.

1112
01:30:29,851 --> 01:30:32,162
So what's different about Nolly, eh?

1113
01:30:32,751 --> 01:30:34,219
He's the same as us,

1114
01:30:34,339 --> 01:30:35,859
he ain't worth nothing.

1115
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:37,974
Like I said, Dodge.

1116
01:30:38,094 --> 01:30:40,444
I'm just enjoying the peace and quiet.

1117
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:42,290
Or I was.

1118
01:31:03,689 --> 01:31:04,788
Mrs Carney,

1119
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:08,041
fetch her...

1120
01:31:09,969 --> 01:31:11,564
I can only tell her...

1121
01:31:11,684 --> 01:31:14,266
Don't fuss so, Sal, please.

1122
01:31:14,395 --> 01:31:15,734
Try and go easy.

1123
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,118
Courage, Bumble.

1124
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:26,746
Courage!

1125
01:31:27,769 --> 01:31:30,258
Faint heart never won fair maid.

1126
01:31:35,143 --> 01:31:36,180
Who is it?

1127
01:31:37,257 --> 01:31:38,149
It is I,

1128
01:31:38,595 --> 01:31:39,511
Bumble.

1129
01:31:40,227 --> 01:31:43,304
I was performing
my nightly run to the dormitories,

1130
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:45,205
when I saw your lights.

1131
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:46,549
I...

1132
01:31:47,084 --> 01:31:48,681
wondered if all was well.

1133
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:51,101
One moment, Sir...

1134
01:32:04,469 --> 01:32:05,509
Madam...

1135
01:32:07,099 --> 01:32:08,349
Oh, Mr Bumble...

1136
01:32:09,871 --> 01:32:10,830
Madam?

1137
01:32:11,123 --> 01:32:12,673
Have you been crying?

1138
01:32:19,299 --> 01:32:20,749
I have added sugar,

1139
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:23,229
though I am sure
you are quite sweet enough.

1140
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:25,629
How very gallant you are, Mr Bumble.

1141
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,486
My... My dear Mrs Corney,

1142
01:32:31,302 --> 01:32:34,203
might you confide
in me the reason why those

1143
01:32:34,743 --> 01:32:38,324
delightful eyes of yours
are so dewy with sadness?

1144
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:41,509
I'm most unsuitably attired
to confide in a gentleman.

1145
01:32:42,785 --> 01:32:44,462
And if the board should hear

1146
01:32:44,582 --> 01:32:47,738
that I received a gentleman
in the intimacy of me rooms,

1147
01:32:47,858 --> 01:32:50,439
then they would dismiss me
and I would find myself

1148
01:32:50,559 --> 01:32:53,069
- cast out to add to my woes.
- Madam,

1149
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:55,395
do not upset yourself.

1150
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,329
We shall not tell them.

1151
01:32:58,985 --> 01:32:59,955
Now,

1152
01:33:00,295 --> 01:33:02,468
unburden yourself of your worries.

1153
01:33:02,871 --> 01:33:04,221
And be comforted.

1154
01:33:04,379 --> 01:33:05,629
Bumble is here.

1155
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:07,834
It is nothing, Sir.

1156
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:11,024
Just the travails that plague
every poor widow

1157
01:33:11,144 --> 01:33:13,372
who endures a life of penury and want,

1158
01:33:13,492 --> 01:33:16,376
who's friendless and alone,
whose bed is cold and unwelcoming,

1159
01:33:16,496 --> 01:33:18,936
whose very existence
is as devoid of love

1160
01:33:19,056 --> 01:33:21,669
as a desert is of orchards
and peach trees...

1161
01:33:25,209 --> 01:33:26,830
But,'tis nothing, Sir.

1162
01:33:27,652 --> 01:33:29,829
Pray, leave me to me foolish tears!

1163
01:33:31,075 --> 01:33:32,707
I will do no such thing.

1164
01:33:35,306 --> 01:33:36,306
Mrs Carney,

1165
01:33:37,246 --> 01:33:38,396
I must confess

1166
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:40,873
you have been much
in my thoughts and now,

1167
01:33:40,993 --> 01:33:43,498
every fiber of my being
demands to be heard.

1168
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,268
My very soul cries out,

1169
01:33:45,388 --> 01:33:46,829
I love you, Mrs Corney!

1170
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:48,869
- Oh!
- I say I love you!

1171
01:33:49,682 --> 01:33:52,224
If you will be Mrs Bumble,

1172
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:55,688
you will never be friendless
and alone again.

1173
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:59,844
The bed shall be
as warm as Sunday beef

1174
01:34:00,584 --> 01:34:03,820
and in the desert of your heart,
roses will bloom!

1175
01:34:05,112 --> 01:34:06,332
Oh, Mr Bumble!

1176
01:34:10,513 --> 01:34:12,427
To be the wife of a Beadle!

1177
01:34:13,297 --> 01:34:15,109
Invited to parochial banquets!

1178
01:34:16,008 --> 01:34:17,909
It's more than I ever dreamed!

1179
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:21,562
Marry me, Madam,

1180
01:34:21,702 --> 01:34:24,544
marry me! I burst with ardour!

1181
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:26,915
Oh, yes, Sir! I am yours!

1182
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:30,557
I have long dreamed of this...

1183
01:34:36,057 --> 01:34:37,707
Mrs Corney? It's Molly.

1184
01:34:38,122 --> 01:34:40,272
- You must come.
- Send her away.

1185
01:34:41,306 --> 01:34:43,661
I said I wasn't to be disturbed!

1186
01:34:43,932 --> 01:34:45,882
I know, Ma'am, but it's Sally.

1187
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:47,342
She's going.

1188
01:34:47,462 --> 01:34:49,883
And she insists
on talking to you first.

1189
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,269
Oh, Mr Bumble,

1190
01:34:51,531 --> 01:34:53,504
perhaps I'd better go and, er...

1191
01:34:53,624 --> 01:34:55,774
Do your duty, Madam, do your duty.

1192
01:34:56,039 --> 01:34:57,495
Then come back to me

1193
01:34:57,659 --> 01:35:00,009
and there will be more of such kisses.

1194
01:35:12,586 --> 01:35:13,631
Well?

1195
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,942
This had better be good.

1196
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:19,429
We have to be alone.

1197
01:35:20,672 --> 01:35:22,985
I can't let no-one else hear my sin.

1198
01:35:25,826 --> 01:35:27,822
Right. What is it?

1199
01:35:29,364 --> 01:35:31,246
It was in this very room.

1200
01:35:33,452 --> 01:35:34,896
A young girl who died

1201
01:35:35,072 --> 01:35:36,610
when her baby was born.

1202
01:35:36,751 --> 01:35:38,453
There's enough silly girls with babies.

1203
01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:40,749
How am I supposed to remember this one?

1204
01:35:41,343 --> 01:35:43,110
Her name was Agnes.

1205
01:35:45,589 --> 01:35:47,039
And the baby's name

1206
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:49,549
is Oliver Twist.

1207
01:36:00,932 --> 01:36:02,118
Oliver Twist?

1208
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:05,149
There was a letter.

1209
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:07,149
What letter?

1210
01:36:08,471 --> 01:36:10,482
A letter she asked me to send.

1211
01:36:12,777 --> 01:36:13,628
But I never,

1212
01:36:15,031 --> 01:36:16,981
and I took something from her.

1213
01:36:18,988 --> 01:36:21,309
And I ain't been able
to live with what I done

1214
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,841
and I can't die with it.

1215
01:36:23,994 --> 01:36:25,309
What did you take from her?

1216
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:28,029
Under my pillow.

1217
01:36:38,152 --> 01:36:40,533
You must send the letter Mrs Corney.

1218
01:36:42,602 --> 01:36:43,989
Promise me you'll send it,

1219
01:36:46,746 --> 01:36:48,896
cos what I done to Oliver Twist

1220
01:36:50,386 --> 01:36:51,918
and that young girl,

1221
01:36:53,826 --> 01:36:55,134
it has haunted me.

1222
01:36:57,258 --> 01:36:58,993
You promise, Mrs Corney?

1223
01:36:59,629 --> 01:37:02,729
Oh, I'll see the items reach
the interested parties.

1224
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:07,858
Will God forgive me

1225
01:37:08,968 --> 01:37:10,189
and have mercy on me?

1226
01:37:10,877 --> 01:37:12,192
How should I know?

1227
01:37:12,943 --> 01:37:14,469
Ask him when you see him.

1228
01:37:19,126 --> 01:37:20,136
Agnes...

1229
01:37:23,907 --> 01:37:25,314
I'm so sorry...

1230
01:37:40,332 --> 01:37:41,282
Oh, Bill,

1231
01:37:41,402 --> 01:37:43,789
- what you done to him?
- I ain't done nothin'to him.

1232
01:37:46,413 --> 01:37:48,029
Guns and dogs, they had.

1233
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:50,251
Oh! He's been shot? Oh, darlin'!

1234
01:37:50,371 --> 01:37:51,914
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's your darlin'.

1235
01:37:52,034 --> 01:37:53,730
Give him a cuddle, that's right.

1236
01:37:53,871 --> 01:37:54,829
Never mind me,

1237
01:37:55,231 --> 01:37:56,801
all night in a bleeding pond.

1238
01:37:56,930 --> 01:37:58,989
- I told him you'd keep him safe.
- I kept him alive!

1239
01:37:59,251 --> 01:38:01,297
Hardly, he's covered in blood!

1240
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,749
I could've just cracked
his neck and dumped him.

1241
01:38:05,058 --> 01:38:06,429
You get him to Fagin.

1242
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:08,698
Then get back here,
bring another bottle.

1243
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:10,189
I'm not your servant!

1244
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:13,089
Do as you're told.

1245
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:15,219
Or else!

1246
01:38:16,882 --> 01:38:18,598
With a child in my arms, Bill?

1247
01:38:18,718 --> 01:38:19,789
A child in my arms.

1248
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:22,160
Go on,

1249
01:38:23,552 --> 01:38:24,552
get going.

1250
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:27,731
Get'im out of'ere.

1251
01:38:48,799 --> 01:38:50,029
We are made, Bumble!

1252
01:38:50,866 --> 01:38:53,189
- We are made.
- Made?

1253
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,868
The gentleman who came
asking about Oliver Twist,

1254
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:57,131
Mr Monks.

1255
01:38:58,426 --> 01:39:01,093
It seems I have found
what he was looking for.

1256
01:39:01,338 --> 01:39:03,922
Admire your betrothed
if you please, Sir.

1257
01:39:04,415 --> 01:39:07,162
- I beg your pardon?
- Admire me for the presence of mind

1258
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:09,029
I displayed in getting his address.

1259
01:39:11,682 --> 01:39:13,429
Oh and isn't he a sly one?

1260
01:39:13,909 --> 01:39:15,804
'The Young Master'indeed.

1261
01:39:17,036 --> 01:39:19,086
I will write to him immediately.

1262
01:39:26,742 --> 01:39:29,480
Madam, that's a private letter...

1263
01:39:30,338 --> 01:39:32,428
If Mr Monks wishes to buy,
then we must know

1264
01:39:32,557 --> 01:39:34,575
the value of what we are selling.
If we do not,

1265
01:39:34,695 --> 01:39:35,985
we cannot fix a price,

1266
01:39:36,105 --> 01:39:37,829
can we, Mr Bumble?

1267
01:39:43,869 --> 01:39:44,869
Shot?

1268
01:39:50,291 --> 01:39:52,549
He's cold as ice, Fagin,
he needs a bed.

1269
01:39:53,139 --> 01:39:54,069
In the eaves.

1270
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:55,451
Right.

1271
01:39:56,132 --> 01:39:58,309
All right darlin', you're all right.

1272
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:03,820
Go to work!

1273
01:40:04,853 --> 01:40:05,875
Now!

1274
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:14,106
Get the quack, Dodger.

1275
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:27,662
We should search all the markets,
wherever there are children.

1276
01:40:29,555 --> 01:40:31,405
Sssh, someone's coming down.

1277
01:40:34,189 --> 01:40:35,469
Good morning, Rose.

1278
01:40:36,499 --> 01:40:38,549
Thinking of your day's shopping?

1279
01:40:38,871 --> 01:40:39,871
Oh, yes!

1280
01:40:40,321 --> 01:40:43,081
Gloves and lace and pretty things.

1281
01:40:43,309 --> 01:40:45,659
- Your shawl, Miss Rose.
- Allow me.

1282
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,450
It makes me very happy, Rose,
to see you

1283
01:40:49,622 --> 01:40:52,872
indulging in all the normal frivolities
of young ladies.

1284
01:40:53,183 --> 01:40:55,233
And why should I not, Mr Edward?

1285
01:40:55,611 --> 01:40:57,937
I understood from my Grandfather
that you had...

1286
01:40:58,057 --> 01:40:59,874
a rather upsetting time with

1287
01:40:59,994 --> 01:41:02,274
a street urchin, some ruffian boy?

1288
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,182
Upsetting? No, not at all.

1289
01:41:04,372 --> 01:41:06,622
As you can see, I am perfectly fine.

1290
01:41:07,805 --> 01:41:09,621
I'm very glad to hear it.

1291
01:41:11,435 --> 01:41:14,185
- Mrs Bedwin, shall we go?
- Yes, Miss Rose.

1292
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:15,359
Mr Edward.

1293
01:41:31,247 --> 01:41:32,247
Well?

1294
01:41:32,769 --> 01:41:34,709
Flesh wound. Superficial.

1295
01:41:36,743 --> 01:41:37,658
So he'll live?

1296
01:41:38,123 --> 01:41:41,522
Who is to say, the injury is minor,
but the infection...

1297
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:45,843
Well, infection can set in
and turn red blood to green pus,

1298
01:41:46,137 --> 01:41:48,473
pink limbs to putrifying stumps

1299
01:41:49,483 --> 01:41:50,974
within a day.

1300
01:41:51,115 --> 01:41:53,405
Death is a blessed release

1301
01:41:53,734 --> 01:41:54,943
from the agony.

1302
01:41:55,103 --> 01:41:56,709
He can hear you, you know!

1303
01:41:58,621 --> 01:41:59,729
Last one.

1304
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:03,625
Leeches.

1305
01:42:04,289 --> 01:42:05,629
I have leeches.

1306
01:42:06,006 --> 01:42:08,309
How about a poultice,
to draw away the poison?

1307
01:42:08,571 --> 01:42:10,935
Everything you've got. I'll pay.

1308
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:21,014
Should he succomb to infection,

1309
01:42:21,134 --> 01:42:23,748
give me first refuse along the cadaver.

1310
01:42:23,969 --> 01:42:26,707
I can get a very good price
up the hospital.

1311
01:42:26,971 --> 01:42:27,971
Get out!

1312
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,908
I'll nurse him.

1313
01:42:42,904 --> 01:42:44,583
Can you go and see Bill for me, Fagin?

1314
01:42:44,712 --> 01:42:47,189
- Tell him I'm staying.
- Happy to, my dear.

1315
01:42:55,061 --> 01:42:55,942
Bill.

1316
01:43:24,969 --> 01:43:27,150
If he dies, Bill...

1317
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:29,436
He is my treasure,

1318
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,405
my prize, my reward
for keeping the faith,

1319
01:43:32,525 --> 01:43:34,593
and if he dies because of you...

1320
01:43:39,851 --> 01:43:40,934
Shut up!

1321
01:43:44,649 --> 01:43:45,999
You kicked my dog.

1322
01:43:46,957 --> 01:43:50,496
- He was provoking me.
- You kicked my dog.

1323
01:43:51,107 --> 01:43:53,898
Nancy's with the boy,
she wanted you to know.

1324
01:43:55,509 --> 01:43:56,612
All right then,

1325
01:43:56,754 --> 01:43:57,754
off you go.

1326
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:02,507
- Why you still here?
- I'm trying to leave.

1327
01:44:02,723 --> 01:44:05,118
- Well, what's stopping ya?
- You are, Bill.

1328
01:44:05,259 --> 01:44:06,225
Please,

1329
01:44:06,354 --> 01:44:07,877
Bill, let me go.

1330
01:44:09,865 --> 01:44:12,074
Seeing as you want to go so much,

1331
01:44:12,194 --> 01:44:13,545
let me help you.

1332
01:44:13,955 --> 01:44:15,282
Thank you, Bill.

1333
01:44:31,704 --> 01:44:33,701
Oh, look at the state of you!

1334
01:44:33,821 --> 01:44:35,379
I weren't born to this.

1335
01:44:36,081 --> 01:44:38,149
I was meant for better.

1336
01:44:39,635 --> 01:44:40,785
When I'm rich,

1337
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:44,709
I won't have to associate
with people like you!

1338
01:44:46,816 --> 01:44:49,094
You won't ever be rich, Fagin.

1339
01:44:49,704 --> 01:44:51,571
This is all you're ever gonna be,

1340
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,697
a fat, stinking,

1341
01:44:54,061 --> 01:44:56,609
'orrible little fence
lying in the dirt.

1342
01:44:57,447 --> 01:44:59,197
You were meant for better?

1343
01:45:00,701 --> 01:45:02,208
Don't make me laugh.

1344
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:07,065
Well, we'll see about that,

1345
01:45:07,759 --> 01:45:09,009
won't we, Bill?

1346
01:45:16,508 --> 01:45:18,745
Won't we, my dear?

1347
01:45:42,199 --> 01:45:44,518
A lady? What sort of lady?

1348
01:45:45,322 --> 01:45:47,042
Posh lady. Young.

1349
01:45:47,242 --> 01:45:49,085
With a old'un. Her mum, maybe.

1350
01:45:50,008 --> 01:45:53,666
What would a nice young lady
want with our Nolly, eh?

1351
01:45:55,255 --> 01:45:56,705
Didn't say nothing?

1352
01:45:56,825 --> 01:45:58,293
- Nah.
- Good boy.

1353
01:46:01,691 --> 01:46:03,388
Nothing to them, neither.

1354
01:46:05,417 --> 01:46:06,697
Get your dinner.

1355
01:46:12,931 --> 01:46:15,563
- You in, Scraps?
- Yeah. Come on.

1356
01:46:21,997 --> 01:46:23,044
Nance?

1357
01:46:24,017 --> 01:46:25,675
Why don't you come down, Nance?

1358
01:46:25,795 --> 01:46:27,045
Sit by the fire?

1359
01:46:27,545 --> 01:46:29,506
We've drinks and cards going.

1360
01:46:30,295 --> 01:46:31,645
He's got a fever.

1361
01:46:32,417 --> 01:46:33,867
Way I see it, Nance,

1362
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:35,469
he'll either die or he'll live.

1363
01:46:35,924 --> 01:46:38,309
Ain't nothing you nor no-one else
can do about it.

1364
01:46:39,109 --> 01:46:40,659
Anyhow, he's kipping.

1365
01:46:41,055 --> 01:46:42,349
So why don't you come down?

1366
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:44,871
Have a laugh, like we used to?

1367
01:46:47,337 --> 01:46:48,311
Nancy?

1368
01:47:00,148 --> 01:47:02,389
You ain't her favorite no more,
is it Dodge?

1369
01:47:02,509 --> 01:47:04,762
Been knocked right off your perch,
my son.

1370
01:47:04,882 --> 01:47:06,469
Look at him, all broken-hearted.

1371
01:47:06,731 --> 01:47:09,044
He'll be blubbing in a minute,
"Oh, Nancy,

1372
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:11,264
why don't you love me best no more?"

1373
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:14,784
Least I've got my teeth.

1374
01:47:14,904 --> 01:47:16,455
What girl's gonna fancy you

1375
01:47:16,575 --> 01:47:18,021
with your reeking, rotten mouth?

1376
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,709
Got breath like an open grave.

1377
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:23,620
Don't bring it on unless
you can handle it, Pearly.

1378
01:47:23,986 --> 01:47:25,160
Nice one Dodge.

1379
01:47:26,111 --> 01:47:27,133
Nice.

1380
01:47:37,413 --> 01:47:39,398
So sorry to keep you waiting.

1381
01:47:48,926 --> 01:47:50,746
And how was your day, Rose?

1382
01:47:51,447 --> 01:47:53,597
Did you get everything you needed?

1383
01:47:53,996 --> 01:47:56,746
Yes, I did, thank you, Uncle.
It was most enjoyable.

1384
01:47:57,289 --> 01:47:58,834
That's curious then,

1385
01:47:59,044 --> 01:48:01,638
for Edward visited the same shop,

1386
01:48:01,779 --> 01:48:03,822
in the hope of finding you there.

1387
01:48:04,946 --> 01:48:06,337
And the haberdasher,

1388
01:48:06,513 --> 01:48:09,871
the one with whom you've apparently
spent most of the day,

1389
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,509
says you haven't been
to his shop for several months.

1390
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:17,709
Mrs Bedwin, would you carely explain?

1391
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:19,530
Mrs Bedwin is blameless.

1392
01:48:20,801 --> 01:48:22,680
I asked her to accompany me.

1393
01:48:27,778 --> 01:48:29,539
We have been trying to find Oliver.

1394
01:48:30,138 --> 01:48:31,136
What?

1395
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:34,749
I have been looking
and asking questions in the streets,

1396
01:48:35,011 --> 01:48:36,909
in the poorer areas of the city, and

1397
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:39,931
and Mrs Bedwin
has been good enough to help me.

1398
01:48:40,179 --> 01:48:42,175
- He stole from us.
- No, he didn't.

1399
01:48:42,304 --> 01:48:44,007
He stole and ran away.

1400
01:48:44,406 --> 01:48:46,050
And you go looking for him?

1401
01:48:46,567 --> 01:48:48,140
Anything could have happened to you!

1402
01:48:48,270 --> 01:48:49,585
I have to know

1403
01:48:49,726 --> 01:48:51,950
where you are and whom you are with.

1404
01:48:53,506 --> 01:48:54,656
You know this!

1405
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:57,569
Sir...

1406
01:49:00,189 --> 01:49:02,429
Keeping me safe at home
will not bring my sister back.

1407
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:06,607
Knowing where I am
every minute of the day

1408
01:49:06,759 --> 01:49:08,614
will not make Agnes return.

1409
01:49:09,133 --> 01:49:12,030
I am doing everything in my power

1410
01:49:12,291 --> 01:49:14,952
to bring your sister
and her child home.

1411
01:49:15,072 --> 01:49:16,469
Dearest Uncle...

1412
01:49:18,099 --> 01:49:19,189
...Agnes is dead.

1413
01:49:19,731 --> 01:49:21,869
- No.
- She was my sister!

1414
01:49:22,131 --> 01:49:23,580
She would never have left me

1415
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,309
these ten long years without word.
She would not have done that.

1416
01:49:27,507 --> 01:49:29,052
Two hearts as one.

1417
01:49:29,573 --> 01:49:31,723
You bought us these lockets, Sir.

1418
01:49:32,152 --> 01:49:34,429
Two hearts as one,
she would not have left me.

1419
01:49:34,691 --> 01:49:36,345
We wore them every day.

1420
01:49:37,197 --> 01:49:38,347
Agnes is dead.

1421
01:49:39,069 --> 01:49:41,641
And I pray,
I pray we find her child, I do.

1422
01:49:41,793 --> 01:49:43,167
But in the meantime,

1423
01:49:43,332 --> 01:49:45,469
Oliver is out there
and something happened to him.

1424
01:49:45,731 --> 01:49:47,846
I will search for him
and I will not stop

1425
01:49:47,999 --> 01:49:50,641
untill know he is safe,
because he is not safe.

1426
01:49:50,817 --> 01:49:53,812
And you call him a thief, Sir,
but I know he is not.

1427
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,578
And if he ever were
then we can only guess why,

1428
01:49:56,698 --> 01:49:59,789
because you didn't see him,
and he had been thrashed, Sir.

1429
01:50:00,661 --> 01:50:03,420
Thrashed and beaten
till his back was scarred!

1430
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:05,331
A child!

1431
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:08,782
This and worse happens
to children every single day

1432
01:50:08,902 --> 01:50:11,355
and we sit here eating soup!
We just sit here!

1433
01:50:11,484 --> 01:50:15,347
- Rose, you will make yourself ill.
- I am not ill! I'm angry!

1434
01:50:17,929 --> 01:50:19,115
I am so angry!

1435
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:22,508
I'm sorry.

1436
01:50:34,869 --> 01:50:37,358
Allow me to speak with her,
Grandfather.

1437
01:50:49,531 --> 01:50:51,207
You must forgive my outburst, Sir,

1438
01:50:51,327 --> 01:50:53,469
it was most ill-judged.

1439
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:55,391
No forgiveness necessary.

1440
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:59,284
Your passion thrilled me.
You thrill me, Rose.

1441
01:51:00,493 --> 01:51:01,820
I was wondering

1442
01:51:02,326 --> 01:51:05,076
what better use
could be made of that passion.

1443
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,410
I beg your pardon, Sir?

1444
01:51:09,501 --> 01:51:11,578
Have you ever considered
what will happen to you

1445
01:51:11,698 --> 01:51:13,739
when my Grandfather passes away?

1446
01:51:14,692 --> 01:51:15,826
This house,

1447
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:19,060
everything in it, will belong to me.

1448
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:21,972
- And my sister's child, Sir.
- 0f course.

1449
01:51:23,803 --> 01:51:25,629
But you could be
mistress of this house.

1450
01:51:26,909 --> 01:51:29,659
We could live here together,
as man and wife.

1451
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,600
There is a...

1452
01:51:32,512 --> 01:51:34,860
symmetry, isn't there?

1453
01:51:35,731 --> 01:51:37,949
Your sister, my father,

1454
01:51:38,409 --> 01:51:40,467
together all those years ago,

1455
01:51:41,057 --> 01:51:42,619
and now, you,

1456
01:51:44,092 --> 01:51:44,902
me.

1457
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:47,499
They loved each other.

1458
01:51:48,377 --> 01:51:51,081
What they were to each other
is not a reason for our marriage.

1459
01:51:51,201 --> 01:51:53,251
No, the reason for our marriage

1460
01:51:53,701 --> 01:51:55,151
is that I desire it.

1461
01:51:55,566 --> 01:51:58,651
Do not keep touching me, Sir,
I cannot endure it!

1462
01:52:00,473 --> 01:52:01,448
So...

1463
01:52:04,642 --> 01:52:06,360
You'll consider my proposal.

1464
01:52:06,837 --> 01:52:08,582
I shall go and tell my Grandfather

1465
01:52:08,702 --> 01:52:10,865
you are calmer and contrite.

1466
01:52:15,035 --> 01:52:16,925
Oh, just, a... just a curl,

1467
01:52:17,371 --> 01:52:18,421
come loose.

1468
01:52:20,509 --> 01:52:21,659
You see, Rose,

1469
01:52:22,433 --> 01:52:23,669
someone in your position

1470
01:52:24,262 --> 01:52:26,367
must learn to endure anything.

1471
01:52:43,981 --> 01:52:45,307
I'll take that.

1472
01:52:45,812 --> 01:52:48,102
I am the young master, after all?

1473
01:52:49,519 --> 01:52:51,069
You are tough, Oliver.

1474
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:54,075
This would've decked
a man bigger than you

1475
01:52:54,195 --> 01:52:55,861
and here you are, sitting up.

1476
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:58,860
You'll be dancing on tables tomorrow.

1477
01:53:01,512 --> 01:53:02,512
There.

1478
01:53:04,825 --> 01:53:06,575
You go to sleep now, yeah?

1479
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,519
You'll be here when I wake up?

1480
01:53:08,827 --> 01:53:10,313
Well, course I will.

1481
01:53:14,134 --> 01:53:16,346
Sleep tight. Sweet dreams.

1482
01:53:31,595 --> 01:53:34,445
He'll want checking on
during the night, Fagin.

1483
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:37,590
Fagin?

1484
01:54:10,006 --> 01:54:11,027
I'm here.

1485
01:54:12,153 --> 01:54:13,268
Is it done?

1486
01:54:13,702 --> 01:54:14,702
Not yet.

1487
01:54:19,162 --> 01:54:21,393
I said I wanted Oliver Twist dead,

1488
01:54:22,215 --> 01:54:23,865
and you agreed to do it.

1489
01:54:24,668 --> 01:54:26,469
But the boy still breathes.

1490
01:54:27,718 --> 01:54:28,718
Why?

1491
01:54:28,942 --> 01:54:31,906
As I told you, Mr Monks,
it will take time.

1492
01:54:32,026 --> 01:54:33,533
Neither of us wants to dance

1493
01:54:33,653 --> 01:54:36,903
- on the end of a rope for murder!
- I don't have time.

1494
01:54:37,023 --> 01:54:39,219
The situation has changed, Mr Monks?

1495
01:54:39,862 --> 01:54:41,972
If you want me
to perform this task for you,

1496
01:54:42,092 --> 01:54:45,094
you have to tell me
why it has suddenly become

1497
01:54:45,329 --> 01:54:46,468
more urgent?

1498
01:54:56,395 --> 01:54:59,117
I'll leave London
in the morning for Mudfog.

1499
01:55:00,176 --> 01:55:02,369
- There is evidence...
- Evidence of what?

1500
01:55:02,489 --> 01:55:04,069
You don't need to know any more.

1501
01:55:07,924 --> 01:55:09,662
I want the boy disposed of,
I no longer

1502
01:55:09,931 --> 01:55:11,611
care how you do it.

1503
01:55:12,022 --> 01:55:13,469
I return in two days.

1504
01:55:14,216 --> 01:55:15,866
If the boy is not dead,

1505
01:55:16,467 --> 01:55:18,118
I will do it myself...

1506
01:55:19,029 --> 01:55:20,979
...and you will have no gold.

1507
01:55:54,327 --> 01:55:56,676
- Who did you spend the evening with?
- Bill, put me down!

1508
01:55:57,088 --> 01:55:59,629
- What you been doing?
- I've been nursing the boy!

1509
01:55:59,894 --> 01:56:01,213
Don't lie to me!

1510
01:56:01,544 --> 01:56:03,499
What you doing back so late?
Who you been seeing?

1511
01:56:03,771 --> 01:56:05,965
I keep it clean. Look. Look. Look.

1512
01:56:07,327 --> 01:56:09,667
I thought you'd left me.
Thought you'd gone and left me.

1513
01:56:09,787 --> 01:56:11,229
I would never do that.

1514
01:56:11,349 --> 01:56:12,999
You're my man, ain't ya?

1515
01:56:14,762 --> 01:56:16,911
I'm your girl, yeah?

1516
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:20,043
You and me,
we're together for always, yeah?

1517
01:56:20,163 --> 01:56:21,772
You ever cross me, Nance...

1518
01:56:22,788 --> 01:56:25,653
You ever do anything to betray me,
anything...

1519
01:56:28,002 --> 01:56:29,282
Then I swear...

1520
01:56:31,475 --> 01:56:32,825
...I'll kill you.

1521
01:57:21,406 --> 01:57:22,612
Keep in line,

1522
01:57:22,732 --> 01:57:24,163
ungrateful brats.

1523
01:57:26,651 --> 01:57:28,153
He arrives tonight.

1524
01:57:29,557 --> 01:57:31,611
Then we must prepare ourselves.

1525
01:57:31,731 --> 01:57:33,315
I'll do the talking.

1526
01:57:34,929 --> 01:57:36,179
What shall I do?

1527
01:57:37,353 --> 01:57:38,668
You, Bumble,

1528
01:57:39,854 --> 01:57:42,238
you shall be my valiant protector.

1529
01:57:43,751 --> 01:57:45,501
And by this evening, Sir,

1530
01:57:46,693 --> 01:57:47,961
we will be rich.

1531
01:58:58,611 --> 01:59:00,910
Where d'you think you're going, eh?

1532
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:03,221
I was going to see how Oliver is.

1533
01:59:05,127 --> 01:59:06,235
He can wait.

1534
01:59:06,355 --> 01:59:08,549
No, Bill, I told him
I'd be there when he woke up.

1535
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:11,149
What is it with you and that boy?

1536
01:59:13,064 --> 01:59:14,789
I just like him, that's all.

1537
01:59:16,397 --> 01:59:18,264
Maybe I should've got shot.

1538
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:21,317
Then you'd be looking after me.

1539
01:59:22,984 --> 01:59:25,591
I looked after you plenty, Bill Sikes.

1540
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:28,508
You get enough looking after from me.

1541
01:59:30,318 --> 01:59:31,229
Go on then.

1542
01:59:40,181 --> 01:59:41,029
What?

1543
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:43,130
Bill?

1544
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:46,018
Do you love me?

1545
01:59:48,549 --> 01:59:49,469
Do ya?

1546
01:59:51,933 --> 01:59:54,069
You think you can catch me out
cause I'm half-kip?

1547
01:59:55,406 --> 01:59:56,556
Do ya, though?

1548
01:59:56,891 --> 01:59:58,469
Don't start this now, yeah?

1549
02:00:00,374 --> 02:00:02,217
Go on, I'll see ya later.

1550
02:00:04,624 --> 02:00:07,268
Don't stay out all hours
like last night.

1551
02:00:16,274 --> 02:00:17,390
You're going, Edward?

1552
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:20,984
Simply personal business,
Grandfather, should not take too long.

1553
02:00:21,104 --> 02:00:24,527
It's selfish of me,
in pursuing my search,

1554
02:00:24,647 --> 02:00:26,937
you were forced
to neglect your own affairs.

1555
02:00:27,057 --> 02:00:28,469
I should do more.

1556
02:00:28,731 --> 02:00:31,309
What if Agnes were to hear
that you were looking for her?

1557
02:00:32,276 --> 02:00:33,591
Time has passed,

1558
02:00:34,683 --> 02:00:37,064
she may have forgotten
all that I said.

1559
02:00:37,184 --> 02:00:38,501
And if she hasn't?

1560
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:41,670
The risk of her running away again
is simply too high.

1561
02:00:42,717 --> 02:00:45,109
I am happy to be
your ambassador in this.

1562
02:00:46,350 --> 02:00:49,040
And I know you like
to keep close to Rose.

1563
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:50,202
Edward,

1564
02:00:50,930 --> 02:00:53,666
what Rose said last night

1565
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:56,081
about Agnes being dead...

1566
02:00:56,469 --> 02:00:57,660
Rose was upset

1567
02:00:57,948 --> 02:01:00,269
and I'm sure that she regrets
those words today.

1568
02:01:11,696 --> 02:01:12,870
Safe journey.

1569
02:01:24,972 --> 02:01:26,328
All right, Nance?

1570
02:01:28,295 --> 02:01:29,338
Nance...

1571
02:01:30,688 --> 02:01:31,938
Come on, Dodge.

1572
02:01:32,826 --> 02:01:34,387
You're early, my dear.

1573
02:01:36,739 --> 02:01:38,389
Nolly had a good night,

1574
02:01:38,651 --> 02:01:40,201
looking much brighter.

1575
02:01:42,625 --> 02:01:45,112
- Would you like a bite to eat?
- No.

1576
02:01:54,979 --> 02:01:57,409
Sorry, don't mean to hurt ya, darlin'.

1577
02:01:57,961 --> 02:01:59,073
S'all right.

1578
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:04,324
Tell you what,

1579
02:02:04,834 --> 02:02:06,384
take your mind off it,

1580
02:02:06,836 --> 02:02:08,363
why don't you tell me about

1581
02:02:08,483 --> 02:02:10,533
that house you were staying in.

1582
02:02:10,653 --> 02:02:12,063
What was they called again?

1583
02:02:12,183 --> 02:02:13,202
Rose,

1584
02:02:14,141 --> 02:02:17,088
Mr Brownlow
and Mrs Bedwin.

1585
02:02:18,262 --> 02:02:19,846
She looks after them.

1586
02:02:20,849 --> 02:02:22,199
The food's lovely.

1587
02:02:22,379 --> 02:02:23,629
And their house,

1588
02:02:24,363 --> 02:02:26,789
- what did the house look like?
- There were books.

1589
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:28,358
And a piano.

1590
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:31,109
And the kitchen was really warm.

1591
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,709
I mean the outside, darlin'.

1592
02:02:33,975 --> 02:02:35,173
In your head,

1593
02:02:35,643 --> 02:02:37,780
make like you and me
was walking right up to it.

1594
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:39,549
Alright? Ready to go in.

1595
02:02:39,964 --> 02:02:41,757
Does the front door have a colour?

1596
02:02:41,877 --> 02:02:42,829
Blue.

1597
02:02:43,334 --> 02:02:44,767
Like a dark blue.

1598
02:02:45,823 --> 02:02:48,387
And the knocker's
in the shape of a lion.

1599
02:02:48,841 --> 02:02:49,884
A lion?

1600
02:02:52,203 --> 02:02:54,351
Well, how d'you like that?

1601
02:02:57,566 --> 02:02:58,587
Right,

1602
02:02:59,550 --> 02:03:00,350
that's it.

1603
02:03:02,344 --> 02:03:03,718
All done for now.

1604
02:03:08,252 --> 02:03:11,422
I got to run a little errand,
but I'll be back soon.

1605
02:03:29,449 --> 02:03:30,829
Leaving already, my dear?

1606
02:03:31,924 --> 02:03:33,150
Things to do.

1607
02:03:33,556 --> 02:03:36,149
I'll take good care of him
when you've gone.

1608
02:03:47,206 --> 02:03:48,239
All right.

1609
02:04:00,387 --> 02:04:01,526
Very nice.

1610
02:04:05,323 --> 02:04:06,321
Decent.

1611
02:04:09,601 --> 02:04:10,650
Misfortune

1612
02:04:10,887 --> 02:04:12,634
befell his other suit,

1613
02:04:13,033 --> 02:04:13,985
but...

1614
02:04:15,104 --> 02:04:17,614
we bought new clothes for the boy.

1615
02:04:19,363 --> 02:04:20,363
Oh, yes.

1616
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:22,666
We are poor,

1617
02:04:23,532 --> 02:04:24,814
but honourable.

1618
02:04:26,689 --> 02:04:29,950
They will be so very grateful

1619
02:04:30,210 --> 02:04:32,595
for his return, my dear.

1620
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:37,070
Soon, Ezekiel,

1621
02:04:38,008 --> 02:04:38,959
soon.

1622
02:04:40,063 --> 02:04:42,076
Deliverance from all this.

1623
02:04:43,673 --> 02:04:45,176
It is so close.

1624
02:05:16,706 --> 02:05:18,949
Uncle, I said terrible things to you,

1625
02:05:19,211 --> 02:05:20,780
things I truly regret. I'm sorry.

1626
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:23,051
You've no need to apologise to me.

1627
02:05:23,171 --> 02:05:25,836
Let's not talk of it again,
it's a new day.

1628
02:05:26,224 --> 02:05:27,742
Uncle, I would like your permission

1629
02:05:27,862 --> 02:05:29,740
- to continue looking for Oliver.
- Rose!

1630
02:05:29,860 --> 02:05:32,088
- We could ask someone for help.
- The boy is gone!

1631
02:05:32,208 --> 02:05:34,902
- Why persist in this?
- I have to try.

1632
02:05:36,308 --> 02:05:37,308
Please?

1633
02:05:39,848 --> 02:05:42,437
I will discuss it with Edward
when he returns.

1634
02:05:42,557 --> 02:05:44,280
We will ask his advice.

1635
02:05:45,290 --> 02:05:47,885
My grandson is very fond of you, Rose.

1636
02:05:48,918 --> 02:05:50,323
Yes, Uncle, he...

1637
02:05:51,578 --> 02:05:52,628
spoke to me.

1638
02:05:53,461 --> 02:05:55,469
- He mentioned marriage, but...
- Did he?!

1639
02:05:56,881 --> 02:05:58,470
Oh, Rose.

1640
02:06:00,892 --> 02:06:03,162
You would never want for anything,

1641
02:06:03,677 --> 02:06:04,509
ever again.

1642
02:06:05,243 --> 02:06:05,950
Sir?

1643
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:08,789
This just came through the door
for you and Miss Rose.

1644
02:06:21,173 --> 02:06:22,565
'Dear Mr Brownlow

1645
02:06:22,766 --> 02:06:24,016
and Miss Rose.'

1646
02:06:32,257 --> 02:06:34,618
Did you have a good journey, Sir?

1647
02:06:34,738 --> 02:06:36,888
- Shut up, you fool.
- Yes, Sir.

1648
02:06:38,514 --> 02:06:40,005
You have the items?

1649
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:41,241
I do.

1650
02:06:44,381 --> 02:06:45,698
Show them to me.

1651
02:06:53,254 --> 02:06:54,254
Oliver,

1652
02:06:54,374 --> 02:06:55,905
wake up. Wake up...

1653
02:06:59,514 --> 02:07:01,364
I've got something for you.

1654
02:07:04,666 --> 02:07:05,816
Listen to me.

1655
02:07:06,167 --> 02:07:08,278
I want you to take this. Hide it.

1656
02:07:08,398 --> 02:07:10,707
Keep it with ya,
don't tell no-one you've got it.

1657
02:07:10,827 --> 02:07:13,658
Anyone comes to ya in the night,
anyone who ain't me,

1658
02:07:13,778 --> 02:07:16,299
you stick 'em. Hear me? You stick 'em.

1659
02:07:16,628 --> 02:07:17,870
Why? I don't...

1660
02:07:19,751 --> 02:07:21,229
I need you to keep shtoom.

1661
02:07:21,491 --> 02:07:23,717
Make like you're sleeping,
but anyone comes on ya,

1662
02:07:23,837 --> 02:07:26,189
you stick 'em
and you keep on sticking 'em.

1663
02:07:32,626 --> 02:07:33,636
Nancy.

1664
02:07:35,385 --> 02:07:37,070
Sleep, please.

1665
02:07:38,086 --> 02:07:39,037
For me.

1666
02:07:45,449 --> 02:07:47,621
I'm going to get you out of here.

1667
02:07:48,572 --> 02:07:51,523
I'm going to get you back
to where there's books

1668
02:07:51,811 --> 02:07:54,261
and sunshine
coming through the windows.

1669
02:08:14,306 --> 02:08:16,068
Sleeping, is he, my dear?

1670
02:08:17,113 --> 02:08:17,830
He is.

1671
02:08:18,205 --> 02:08:19,250
Nance?

1672
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:22,136
Is everything all right?

1673
02:08:24,131 --> 02:08:25,509
No problems with Bill?

1674
02:08:28,841 --> 02:08:31,874
Not everything in this life
is about Bill Sikes.

1675
02:08:32,377 --> 02:08:34,009
I don't live in his pocket.

1676
02:08:34,129 --> 02:08:36,082
Nor no-one else's, neither.

1677
02:08:42,096 --> 02:08:43,329
She's changed.

1678
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:45,330
She has.

1679
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:47,430
Won't meet our eyes.

1680
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:49,089
Won't stop and talk.

1681
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:51,950
What does that mean?
'She don't live in Bill's pocket'?

1682
02:08:52,318 --> 02:08:54,909
Maybe she has a new fancy man.

1683
02:08:56,017 --> 02:08:57,749
Well, women is fickle, Fagey.

1684
02:09:00,241 --> 02:09:03,400
She's the only one
who could keep the leash on Bill.

1685
02:09:03,670 --> 02:09:06,723
Be the worse for all of us
if she does leave him.

1686
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:09,360
Sikes running mad could ruin it all.

1687
02:09:09,509 --> 02:09:12,302
Go after. Light-footed and secret,
my Dodge.

1688
02:09:17,293 --> 02:09:20,439
- Rose, go back to the carriage.
- I will not, Sir.

1689
02:09:20,709 --> 02:09:23,923
And please, do not say it again
because I am staying.

1690
02:09:32,888 --> 02:09:33,888
No-one.

1691
02:09:35,147 --> 02:09:36,397
This is a trick.

1692
02:09:38,983 --> 02:09:41,813
- Who's there?
- You're scaring her.

1693
02:09:43,613 --> 02:09:44,345
Hello.

1694
02:09:47,707 --> 02:09:49,057
Are you Miss Rose?

1695
02:09:49,913 --> 02:09:50,915
I am.

1696
02:09:52,230 --> 02:09:53,381
And your name?

1697
02:09:55,667 --> 02:09:56,667
I'm Nancy.

1698
02:10:01,739 --> 02:10:02,989
Give them to me.

1699
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:12,177
How much?

1700
02:10:17,915 --> 02:10:19,149
Pass it to Mr Bumble.

1701
02:10:22,452 --> 02:10:23,682
Thank you, Sir,

1702
02:10:23,802 --> 02:10:25,252
very generous, Sir.

1703
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:27,607
A half sovereign, Madam.

1704
02:10:28,371 --> 02:10:29,269
Not enough.

1705
02:10:29,708 --> 02:10:31,475
The items are worthless.

1706
02:10:31,595 --> 02:10:33,919
They are of sentimental value only,

1707
02:10:34,493 --> 02:10:36,667
shame on you madam, for charging a fee

1708
02:10:36,787 --> 02:10:38,349
to restore a family's property.

1709
02:10:41,557 --> 02:10:42,389
Worthless?

1710
02:10:43,494 --> 02:10:44,947
Why, Mr Monks,

1711
02:10:46,723 --> 02:10:49,100
I would not call
this letter worthless.

1712
02:10:51,006 --> 02:10:52,156
A young lady,

1713
02:10:52,868 --> 02:10:56,435
ward to a rich elderly gentleman
falls in love with his son,

1714
02:10:56,890 --> 02:10:58,702
a man who already has a child of his own

1715
02:10:58,822 --> 02:11:02,294
and find that she's carrying
that gentleman's child out of wedlock.

1716
02:11:04,878 --> 02:11:07,639
It's like something you might see
on the London stage, Sir.

1717
02:11:07,759 --> 02:11:09,229
Very gripping, it was.

1718
02:11:09,490 --> 02:11:12,070
And ever so sad, so much tragic death.

1719
02:11:13,193 --> 02:11:14,749
There's poor young Agnes Leeford

1720
02:11:15,010 --> 02:11:18,185
and the father of this baby,
also sadly deceased...

1721
02:11:19,845 --> 02:11:21,589
Would he be your own father, Mr Monks?

1722
02:11:22,557 --> 02:11:25,749
Or should I call you
by your real name, Edward Brownlow?

1723
02:11:26,651 --> 02:11:27,901
Very scandalous.

1724
02:11:29,321 --> 02:11:30,836
Seems the rich are as unable

1725
02:11:30,956 --> 02:11:32,950
to control themselves as the poor.

1726
02:11:33,736 --> 02:11:35,164
Very dirty story.

1727
02:11:36,368 --> 02:11:38,218
But sift through the dirt...

1728
02:11:41,530 --> 02:11:42,909
...and you find gold.

1729
02:11:46,015 --> 02:11:48,875
Is that what's at the bottom
of all this, Sir?

1730
02:11:49,682 --> 02:11:50,390
Money?

1731
02:11:51,141 --> 02:11:53,069
What a squalid mind you have, Madam.

1732
02:11:55,167 --> 02:11:56,517
Squalid it may be,

1733
02:11:56,637 --> 02:11:58,887
but I'm never too far off the mark.

1734
02:11:59,885 --> 02:12:02,231
I see so much of human life
you see, Sir,

1735
02:12:02,351 --> 02:12:05,069
and you look to me
like a man with expectations.

1736
02:12:06,002 --> 02:12:07,869
And this young Oliver Twist,

1737
02:12:08,879 --> 02:12:10,188
if he were to be found,

1738
02:12:10,308 --> 02:12:13,321
would he be sharing
those expectations with you?

1739
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:19,348
Oh, to have your inheritance halved

1740
02:12:19,468 --> 02:12:21,176
by a workhouse bastard.

1741
02:12:24,230 --> 02:12:26,167
That must cut like a knife.

1742
02:12:27,729 --> 02:12:30,157
This letter's far from worthless, Sir.

1743
02:12:30,606 --> 02:12:31,509
Give it to me.

1744
02:12:32,297 --> 02:12:33,629
Forty guineas and it's yours.

1745
02:12:34,866 --> 02:12:35,866
No.

1746
02:12:36,518 --> 02:12:37,768
Very good, Sir,

1747
02:12:39,335 --> 02:12:41,590
let's haggle ***.
Some friendly ***.

1748
02:12:42,323 --> 02:12:43,549
Forty guineas.

1749
02:12:46,657 --> 02:12:49,299
I could always send it
to the person it was meant for.

1750
02:12:51,425 --> 02:12:52,493
My windpipe!

1751
02:12:54,642 --> 02:12:57,149
- Give me the letter.
- Forty guineas.

1752
02:12:59,139 --> 02:13:00,101
Madam!

1753
02:13:00,334 --> 02:13:02,508
Give him the letter! I'm choking!

1754
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,110
Forty guineas.

1755
02:13:07,862 --> 02:13:09,368
Give me the letter,

1756
02:13:09,611 --> 02:13:11,631
or I will tear his face off...

1757
02:13:12,731 --> 02:13:14,949
...and you can feed it
to your starving orphans.

1758
02:13:17,036 --> 02:13:18,186
Forty guineas.

1759
02:13:21,653 --> 02:13:23,484
He never run away from ya,

1760
02:13:24,130 --> 02:13:26,405
we trapped him, we took him back.

1761
02:13:26,957 --> 02:13:29,676
Why haven't you brought
Oliver back to us?

1762
02:13:29,796 --> 02:13:31,189
You don't know nothing, do ya?

1763
02:13:31,450 --> 02:13:33,847
There's no bargain to be made here.

1764
02:13:34,383 --> 02:13:36,690
I will offer a small reward,
that's all.

1765
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:38,337
I'm risking everything

1766
02:13:38,457 --> 02:13:40,589
- and you think I want a few coins?
- Of course not!

1767
02:13:42,091 --> 02:13:45,411
- We just want to know that Oliver's safe.
- He ain't.

1768
02:13:45,531 --> 02:13:47,128
You have to help him.

1769
02:13:47,994 --> 02:13:49,869
There are those who want him dead.

1770
02:13:50,665 --> 02:13:51,390
Dead?

1771
02:13:52,205 --> 02:13:54,655
- The boy has nothing.
- There's a man

1772
02:13:54,995 --> 02:13:56,169
called Fagin,

1773
02:13:56,917 --> 02:13:58,909
he's to arrange it
for a man called Monks.

1774
02:13:59,536 --> 02:14:00,536
Monks?

1775
02:14:00,788 --> 02:14:02,388
He's the one that wants Oliver dead.

1776
02:14:02,508 --> 02:14:04,835
He's a gentleman, like yourself.

1777
02:14:05,497 --> 02:14:08,147
He dresses nicely,
speaks proper. He's got a

1778
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:11,150
red mark going all up
his neck and face there.

1779
02:14:11,898 --> 02:14:12,898
Uncle.

1780
02:14:14,302 --> 02:14:15,302
No!

1781
02:14:18,956 --> 02:14:20,206
No, it can't be.

1782
02:14:20,361 --> 02:14:22,189
Don't tell me what it can and can't be!

1783
02:14:22,449 --> 02:14:23,761
I tell ya, I heard 'em!

1784
02:14:23,881 --> 02:14:25,601
Monks wants Oliver dead.

1785
02:14:25,721 --> 02:14:27,549
- You're lying.
- Why would I lie?

1786
02:14:39,935 --> 02:14:41,485
I will take the letter

1787
02:14:42,386 --> 02:14:43,870
and both your lives,

1788
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:46,689
and it will mean nothing to me,

1789
02:14:47,498 --> 02:14:48,748
I will leave you

1790
02:14:49,353 --> 02:14:51,203
in a pool of your own blood

1791
02:14:52,101 --> 02:14:53,851
and deny I was ever here.

1792
02:14:54,856 --> 02:14:56,106
As a gentleman,

1793
02:14:56,355 --> 02:14:59,105
what reason would I have
to visit a workhouse?

1794
02:15:00,511 --> 02:15:01,961
So rather than argue

1795
02:15:02,419 --> 02:15:03,969
the value of a letter,

1796
02:15:04,666 --> 02:15:05,916
value instead...

1797
02:15:06,769 --> 02:15:08,519
what your lives are worth.

1798
02:15:09,823 --> 02:15:11,473
For in this very minute,

1799
02:15:12,878 --> 02:15:14,628
they hang in the balance.

1800
02:15:20,584 --> 02:15:22,587
Give me the letter.

1801
02:15:28,597 --> 02:15:29,749
That is a clever girl.

1802
02:15:37,909 --> 02:15:38,794
No,

1803
02:15:38,914 --> 02:15:40,864
not the parish register, Sir.

1804
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:44,317
How will we know
who's been born and who's died?

1805
02:15:53,035 --> 02:15:55,025
He's gone to some place called

1806
02:15:55,321 --> 02:15:56,030
Mudfog,

1807
02:15:56,519 --> 02:15:58,116
he said, for evidence

1808
02:15:58,891 --> 02:16:00,772
and when he comes back,
it's to happen.

1809
02:16:01,030 --> 02:16:04,106
There's a workhouse at Mudfog.
It was on the list that you gave Edward.

1810
02:16:04,226 --> 02:16:06,663
Edward is nothing to do with this!

1811
02:16:06,783 --> 02:16:08,869
What you talking about
some Edward for?

1812
02:16:09,131 --> 02:16:10,987
Monks is the name.
You're not listening to me!

1813
02:16:11,107 --> 02:16:12,789
- We are.
- He's coming back tomorrow.

1814
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:14,620
Fagin's to have the job done

1815
02:16:14,740 --> 02:16:16,309
or this man Monks will do it himself.

1816
02:16:18,959 --> 02:16:21,091
I'd bring him to you, but I can't,

1817
02:16:21,211 --> 02:16:22,692
you have to go and get him.

1818
02:16:22,812 --> 02:16:24,315
Just tell us what to do.

1819
02:16:24,435 --> 02:16:26,915
I'll tell you how
to find Fagin's place,

1820
02:16:27,485 --> 02:16:29,845
but you have to promise me something.

1821
02:16:30,244 --> 02:16:31,430
If I can.

1822
02:16:31,550 --> 02:16:34,632
That you go the earliest
light of dawn, because...

1823
02:16:36,055 --> 02:16:38,520
There's someone
I have to keep out of it

1824
02:16:38,896 --> 02:16:41,174
and I know he'll be with me by then.

1825
02:16:41,468 --> 02:16:42,390
I promise.

1826
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:43,968
This is a hoax.

1827
02:16:44,331 --> 02:16:46,269
- Rose.
- He don't believe me,

1828
02:16:47,216 --> 02:16:50,809
- he ain't going to help Oliver.
- He will. I'll talk to him.

1829
02:16:51,831 --> 02:16:54,091
How do we find this Fagin's house?

1830
02:16:54,211 --> 02:16:55,761
St Giles, Cripplegate,

1831
02:16:55,917 --> 02:16:58,540
there's a tanner. Up the stairs.
There's door

1832
02:16:58,660 --> 02:17:00,213
with three locks.

1833
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:02,166
You'll find Oliver inside.

1834
02:17:02,626 --> 02:17:05,589
- I've gotta go now.
- If you should need a friend...

1835
02:17:06,424 --> 02:17:08,974
- Don't go against your word.
- We won't.

1836
02:17:09,366 --> 02:17:10,509
Thank you, Miss Nancy.

1837
02:17:13,038 --> 02:17:14,988
That's what Oliver called me.

1838
02:17:16,397 --> 02:17:19,349
He called me 'Miss'.
I won't see him again, now.

1839
02:17:20,100 --> 02:17:21,828
You remember me well to him, will ya?

1840
02:17:21,948 --> 02:17:22,709
Always.

1841
02:17:24,432 --> 02:17:25,800
Always, I promise you.

1842
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:28,030
I said, now, Rose!

1843
02:17:51,198 --> 02:17:52,581
Well, it's not forty guineas,

1844
02:17:52,701 --> 02:17:54,837
but it's enough for a wedding dress.

1845
02:17:58,082 --> 02:17:59,924
I think the money
would be better spent

1846
02:18:00,044 --> 02:18:03,401
on a doctor for my injuries,
which are extensive!

1847
02:18:04,382 --> 02:18:05,732
I am having doubts

1848
02:18:05,852 --> 02:18:08,269
as to whether we will have need
of a wedding dress at all!

1849
02:18:09,237 --> 02:18:09,950
Doubts?

1850
02:18:11,151 --> 02:18:12,895
You were not wifely, Madam!

1851
02:18:13,015 --> 02:18:14,165
I was choked,

1852
02:18:14,381 --> 02:18:16,518
my nostrils near torn asunder

1853
02:18:16,823 --> 02:18:19,419
and all you cared for
was forty guineas!

1854
02:18:19,767 --> 02:18:21,021
Oh, Bumble,

1855
02:18:21,517 --> 02:18:23,807
how can you say such things
to your beloved,

1856
02:18:23,927 --> 02:18:26,003
of course I was worried
near to death for you.

1857
02:18:26,123 --> 02:18:29,188
You did a very fine job
of convincing me otherwise!

1858
02:18:29,616 --> 02:18:31,216
He hypnotised me, Sir!

1859
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:34,266
He had the eyes of a snake!
I couldn't look nowhere else,

1860
02:18:34,386 --> 02:18:37,236
I swear he's the very devil
and I was terrified,

1861
02:18:37,791 --> 02:18:40,750
all I could think of
was being back in your arms.

1862
02:18:42,855 --> 02:18:44,896
My heart was hammering, Sir...

1863
02:18:45,135 --> 02:18:47,006
Can you feel it, pounding away?

1864
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:49,562
Like a trapped bird, it is...

1865
02:18:49,970 --> 02:18:51,158
Go on, feel...

1866
02:18:51,881 --> 02:18:53,704
It is pounding, isn't it?

1867
02:18:54,359 --> 02:18:55,359
Yes, Madam.

1868
02:18:55,991 --> 02:18:58,354
Oh, I'm so weak and silly, Sir.

1869
02:19:01,612 --> 02:19:03,869
I am still your little bunny,
aren't I?

1870
02:19:05,502 --> 02:19:06,349
Yes, Madam.

1871
02:19:07,395 --> 02:19:10,509
And I can still have
the best wedding dress, can't I?

1872
02:19:12,528 --> 02:19:15,809
My little bunny must have
whatever she wants.

1873
02:19:50,131 --> 02:19:51,131
Bill?

1874
02:20:24,471 --> 02:20:26,821
How you can believe a woman like that?

1875
02:20:26,941 --> 02:20:28,913
- A woman like what?
- Isn't it obvious?

1876
02:20:29,033 --> 02:20:31,069
A woman of the streets, a prostitute.

1877
02:20:31,652 --> 02:20:32,886
Or just poor.

1878
02:20:33,932 --> 02:20:36,582
A poor woman
who didn't ask for any reward.

1879
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:37,989
And I do believe her.

1880
02:20:38,627 --> 02:20:42,091
My grandson, whom I love and trust,

1881
02:20:42,584 --> 02:20:45,590
is not capable of assuming
a false name,

1882
02:20:46,455 --> 02:20:48,483
of imagining vile deeds.

1883
02:20:48,603 --> 02:20:50,349
The Edward you know
is not the one I know.

1884
02:20:50,897 --> 02:20:53,574
Lies. All of it, lies.

1885
02:20:53,997 --> 02:20:57,414
Why would a wealthy man
want a child dead?

1886
02:21:02,372 --> 02:21:04,459
Because Oliver is Agnes' child!

1887
02:21:07,526 --> 02:21:10,876
That's what Edward has discovered.
Oliver is Agnes' child.

1888
02:21:12,587 --> 02:21:13,679
He must be.

1889
02:21:14,131 --> 02:21:16,389
He has to be.
Why else would it matter so much?

1890
02:21:16,944 --> 02:21:19,170
Uncle, you love and trust Edward,
but I do not.

1891
02:21:19,290 --> 02:21:20,823
He's threatened to cast me out

1892
02:21:20,943 --> 02:21:22,762
if I don't agree to be his wife.

1893
02:21:22,882 --> 02:21:24,044
He wouldn't.

1894
02:21:24,899 --> 02:21:27,909
- You must have misunderstood.
- You have to go to this place.

1895
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:30,429
You have to do everything Nancy said

1896
02:21:30,691 --> 02:21:32,835
and if she is lying, which she isn't,

1897
02:21:32,955 --> 02:21:35,041
but if she is,
then Oliver won't be there,

1898
02:21:35,161 --> 02:21:36,640
there won't be a man called Fagin,

1899
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,442
no-one will have heard of a Mr Monks

1900
02:21:38,562 --> 02:21:40,241
and Edward is innocent.

1901
02:21:40,361 --> 02:21:41,509
If that is the case,

1902
02:21:41,771 --> 02:21:45,250
if Nancy is lying, then I will never
speak of Oliver again.

1903
02:21:46,049 --> 02:21:49,109
And even though he is repugnant to me,
I will marry Edward.

1904
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:54,970
Fagey, it's worse than you reckon!

1905
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:56,709
- Ain't no new fancy man.
- Dodge!

1906
02:21:56,986 --> 02:21:59,221
Nancy's peached!
The peelers will be on us!

1907
02:21:59,341 --> 02:22:02,127
- Dodger, you must be wrong.
- I ain't got it wrong!

1908
02:22:02,247 --> 02:22:03,549
She's peached, I tell ya!

1909
02:22:03,811 --> 02:22:05,615
Given names! Blown on us.

1910
02:22:14,634 --> 02:22:16,628
None too savage, Bill.

1911
02:22:17,719 --> 02:22:21,008
I'm sure it can be explained,
this is Nancy!

1912
02:22:21,301 --> 02:22:22,804
None too savage!

1913
02:22:34,650 --> 02:22:35,824
There you are,

1914
02:22:36,258 --> 02:22:38,389
was wondering where you'd got to,
tom-catting around.

1915
02:22:46,179 --> 02:22:47,029
Bill...

1916
02:22:47,802 --> 02:22:49,903
Bill, listen to me, listen...

1917
02:22:51,171 --> 02:22:52,421
I kept you out,

1918
02:22:53,789 --> 02:22:55,011
I kept you out.

1919
02:22:55,234 --> 02:22:56,990
I kept you out. I swear.

1920
02:22:57,707 --> 02:22:58,867
I swear, Bill.

1921
02:23:02,184 --> 02:23:04,914
Listen, no, I kept you out.

1922
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:07,149
Please Bill, no!

1923
02:23:07,410 --> 02:23:10,265
Don't, don't! No! No! No!

1924
02:23:10,544 --> 02:23:11,750
Don't! Don't!

1925
02:23:12,159 --> 02:23:13,891
No! No!

1926
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:19,072
What was he doing here?

1927
02:23:19,676 --> 02:23:21,394
He was looking for her.

1928
02:23:24,256 --> 02:23:27,528
You'll only get a smashing yourself,
Dodge.

1929
02:23:27,648 --> 02:23:28,798
I don't care.

1930
02:23:33,827 --> 02:23:34,630
Peelers.

1931
02:23:35,691 --> 02:23:36,869
Peelers are coming.

1932
02:23:38,318 --> 02:23:40,975
We must be swift. Ezekiel.

1933
02:23:45,466 --> 02:23:46,435
Get up.

1934
02:23:47,044 --> 02:23:48,849
You're all right. Get up.

1935
02:23:50,222 --> 02:23:51,372
I warned you.

1936
02:23:53,106 --> 02:23:55,317
I warned you enough times
what would happen

1937
02:23:55,437 --> 02:23:58,187
if you crossed me.
And what do you go and do?

1938
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:01,090
You can't say I didn't warn you,
cos I did!

1939
02:24:04,394 --> 02:24:06,566
That's enough now. Go on. Get up.

1940
02:24:09,531 --> 02:24:11,054
It weren't that bad!

1941
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:14,460
You'll be all right.

1942
02:24:17,848 --> 02:24:19,065
Get up, Nance.

1943
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:26,698
Nancy?

1944
02:25:15,605 --> 02:25:16,755
I'll stick ya!

1945
02:25:17,119 --> 02:25:19,869
You come near me and I'll stick ya
so I will!

1946
02:27:17,097 --> 02:27:18,435
Going somewhere?

1947
02:28:24,136 --> 02:28:25,136
What?

1948
02:28:26,656 --> 02:28:29,239
What are you
looking at me like that for?

1949
02:28:30,073 --> 02:28:32,204
You keep looking at me like that

1950
02:28:32,324 --> 02:28:33,674
and I'll blind ya.

1951
02:28:34,664 --> 02:28:36,143
Keep your eyes down.

1952
02:28:38,077 --> 02:28:39,077
Walk.

1953
02:28:43,077 --> 02:28:44,077
Walk!

1954
02:28:44,548 --> 02:28:46,415
We'll get away from London.

1955
02:28:46,637 --> 02:28:47,637
Move!

1956
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:51,834
He's not upstairs. He's not here.

1957
02:28:54,889 --> 02:28:55,789
He was.

1958
02:28:56,948 --> 02:28:58,710
In his bed. All tucked up.

1959
02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:00,813
I was keeping him safe.

1960
02:29:01,888 --> 02:29:03,454
Perhaps he's killed him already.

1961
02:29:03,574 --> 02:29:04,870
Killed him? No,

1962
02:29:05,334 --> 02:29:08,430
I weren't never going to harm, not me!

1963
02:29:08,690 --> 02:29:10,364
Then what's this, eh?

1964
02:29:12,259 --> 02:29:15,350
I never seen that before in my life,
I swear.

1965
02:29:16,763 --> 02:29:18,390
I didn't want him hurt,

1966
02:29:19,011 --> 02:29:21,041
it was Monks wanted him dead.

1967
02:29:22,229 --> 02:29:23,229
Say that again.

1968
02:29:23,491 --> 02:29:25,770
It was Monks,
with the red mark on his face!

1969
02:29:25,890 --> 02:29:28,430
It was all him, not me. Get him!

1970
02:29:28,690 --> 02:29:30,030
Where is Oliver?

1971
02:29:32,198 --> 02:29:33,364
Sikes took him.

1972
02:29:34,323 --> 02:29:36,989
Where to, I don't know.
If I did, I would tell you.

1973
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:39,511
I want the whole city searched,

1974
02:29:40,051 --> 02:29:42,769
every alley, every cellar,

1975
02:29:42,889 --> 02:29:46,070
- I want this Sikes found.
- I was keeping him safe

1976
02:29:46,330 --> 02:29:48,630
for you,
I knew you wanted him back,

1977
02:29:48,890 --> 02:29:51,350
I even have clothes for him,
under my chair!

1978
02:29:51,611 --> 02:29:54,693
I was going to bring him back,
I give you my word!

1979
02:29:55,447 --> 02:29:57,629
Your word ain't worth nothing, jew.

1980
02:29:57,948 --> 02:29:59,389
Is that your little pet?

1981
02:30:00,449 --> 02:30:01,789
My Ezekiel!

1982
02:30:03,512 --> 02:30:04,662
Get rid of it.

1983
02:30:05,636 --> 02:30:06,636
No...

1984
02:30:07,639 --> 02:30:08,639
No!

1985
02:30:09,919 --> 02:30:11,692
No! No! No!

1986
02:30:28,013 --> 02:30:29,149
Sleep tight, Nance.

1987
02:30:41,499 --> 02:30:42,615
Bill Sikes?

1988
02:30:43,451 --> 02:30:45,327
Bill Sikes! Bill Sikes!

1989
02:30:52,139 --> 02:30:53,289
He's not here.

1990
02:30:53,514 --> 02:30:55,864
Yeah, well, looks like he's been here.

1991
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:00,670
Don't.

1992
02:31:01,138 --> 02:31:02,453
Let her rest.

1993
02:31:03,168 --> 02:31:03,990
His piece.

1994
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:05,990
Look at the state of her.

1995
02:31:13,121 --> 02:31:14,682
Go on, up here.

1996
02:31:19,427 --> 02:31:20,773
- On your feet.
- I can't.

1997
02:31:20,893 --> 02:31:23,586
- I said, on your feet!
- I can't, I can't go on,

1998
02:31:23,706 --> 02:31:26,554
- please, let me go.
- I ain't letting you go nowhere.

1999
02:31:26,812 --> 02:31:28,621
- Are you going to kill me?
- I might do!

2000
02:31:28,741 --> 02:31:30,744
That depends on you, don't it?
How good you do.

2001
02:31:30,864 --> 02:31:33,407
- That depends on what?
- You're my protection, boy.

2002
02:31:33,527 --> 02:31:35,016
You're going to speak for me, see?

2003
02:31:35,136 --> 02:31:36,997
- What am I supposed to say?
- You'll say

2004
02:31:37,117 --> 02:31:39,748
that it weren't me what done it.
You'll say

2005
02:31:39,868 --> 02:31:41,375
that it couldn't've been me,

2006
02:31:41,495 --> 02:31:43,122
not Bill Sikes, cos I weren't...

2007
02:31:43,242 --> 02:31:45,292
Cos I weren't nowhere near her.

2008
02:31:45,412 --> 02:31:47,684
I was out here, weren't I, with you?

2009
02:31:47,804 --> 02:31:48,804
Near who?

2010
02:31:49,106 --> 02:31:49,964
Near Nancy?

2011
02:31:50,487 --> 02:31:52,894
- What's happened to her?
- Nothing!

2012
02:31:53,228 --> 02:31:54,449
It wasn't me.

2013
02:31:54,813 --> 02:31:56,190
That's what you'll say.

2014
02:31:57,525 --> 02:31:59,479
It must've been someone else...

2015
02:31:59,599 --> 02:32:02,029
Cos I would never lift a hand to her.

2016
02:32:02,149 --> 02:32:04,134
You understand me, boy? Never.

2017
02:32:05,284 --> 02:32:07,510
There's blood on your face, Mr Sikes.

2018
02:32:13,789 --> 02:32:14,789
Bull's-eye!

2019
02:32:15,678 --> 02:32:16,678
Dog!

2020
02:32:18,177 --> 02:32:19,177
Dog!

2021
02:32:40,686 --> 02:32:42,718
No, no, no, no!
You're coming with me!

2022
02:32:42,838 --> 02:32:44,044
You're staying with me,

2023
02:32:44,164 --> 02:32:45,383
I need you...

2024
02:33:14,675 --> 02:33:16,330
Rose! The police!

2025
02:33:27,472 --> 02:33:28,928
Did you find him?

2026
02:33:30,056 --> 02:33:31,136
It's Nancy.

2027
02:34:02,933 --> 02:34:03,908
What?

2028
02:34:14,489 --> 02:34:16,039
No, no, no. This way.

2029
02:34:16,509 --> 02:34:17,765
Back to London?

2030
02:34:17,885 --> 02:34:19,430
Stop asking questions! Move!

2031
02:34:19,690 --> 02:34:21,945
I hate the country. Sing something.

2032
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:24,457
- Sing what?
- Some hymn.

2033
02:34:25,176 --> 02:34:27,026
Something outta the church.

2034
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:29,937
Something to keep...

2035
02:34:31,298 --> 02:34:32,298
them away.

2036
02:34:33,750 --> 02:34:34,713
Sing!

2037
02:34:35,793 --> 02:34:38,110
# Abide with me #

2038
02:34:38,893 --> 02:34:42,556
# Fast falls the eventide... #

2039
02:34:57,028 --> 02:34:58,825
- Where is Fagey?
- Gone.

2040
02:34:59,175 --> 02:35:00,525
Peelers took him.

2041
02:35:00,677 --> 02:35:01,989
And us lot is going, too.

2042
02:35:03,300 --> 02:35:04,886
This gaff's done for.

2043
02:35:05,811 --> 02:35:08,101
Come with us if you want,
but know this...

2044
02:35:08,584 --> 02:35:10,094
I'm big potatoes now.

2045
02:35:10,214 --> 02:35:11,300
I'm leader.

2046
02:35:13,362 --> 02:35:14,492
You're welcome to it.

2047
02:35:16,079 --> 02:35:18,228
All right, me blades.
Crack on.

2048
02:35:19,166 --> 02:35:22,068
- Come on then, boys.
- He never had the bottle!

2049
02:35:26,405 --> 02:35:28,110
Come on, boys, move it!

2050
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:45,069
The Master and Miss Rose
are in the drawing room, Sir.

2051
02:35:57,421 --> 02:36:00,298
- Grandfather.
- You're returned quickly, Edward.

2052
02:36:00,418 --> 02:36:03,409
As I said,
a personal matter speedily concluded.

2053
02:36:03,529 --> 02:36:05,709
And satisfactorily, I trust?

2054
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:07,350
Very.

2055
02:36:07,953 --> 02:36:09,582
And who are these gentleman?

2056
02:36:09,702 --> 02:36:11,208
I hope there is nothing amiss?

2057
02:36:11,328 --> 02:36:14,070
And how were things at Mudfog?

2058
02:36:14,980 --> 02:36:15,797
Mud...?

2059
02:36:16,928 --> 02:36:18,895
No, I know of no such

2060
02:36:19,015 --> 02:36:20,665
dismal-sounding place...

2061
02:36:21,452 --> 02:36:23,538
You went to Mudfog

2062
02:36:23,996 --> 02:36:29,092
for evidence concerning
the true parentage of Oliver Twist.

2063
02:36:30,665 --> 02:36:32,662
Do not lie to us, Edward!

2064
02:36:34,263 --> 02:36:35,309
Where is it?

2065
02:36:37,454 --> 02:36:40,283
Gradfather.
Did you lost your mind?

2066
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:45,149
This is unpardonable!

2067
02:36:45,514 --> 02:36:47,469
- Unhand me, Sir!
- I'll have that, Sir.

2068
02:36:48,016 --> 02:36:49,974
- Her locket!
- No!

2069
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:57,110
Don't make this
difficult for yourself, Sir.

2070
02:37:01,401 --> 02:37:04,030
- It is her hand.
- Hold him.

2071
02:37:10,372 --> 02:37:11,852
To Agnes Leeford....

2072
02:37:14,642 --> 02:37:15,692
...deceased.

2073
02:37:24,331 --> 02:37:25,790
To Agnes Leeford,

2074
02:37:26,812 --> 02:37:28,197
a baby boy...

2075
02:37:30,346 --> 02:37:31,830
...father unknown,

2076
02:37:32,953 --> 02:37:34,902
christened Oliver Twist.

2077
02:37:37,638 --> 02:37:40,066
The child we've been searching for.

2078
02:37:45,925 --> 02:37:47,507
'My dearest Guardian,

2079
02:37:48,551 --> 02:37:50,230
'I write to you in hope.

2080
02:37:51,463 --> 02:37:54,150
'My time is very close
and I am penniless.

2081
02:37:55,044 --> 02:37:58,409
'I know you are still so very angry
and disappointed in me,

2082
02:37:58,954 --> 02:38:01,349
'but I am at your mercy
and I beg you to forgive me,

2083
02:38:01,610 --> 02:38:03,011
'if not for my sake,

2084
02:38:03,131 --> 02:38:05,952
'then for William's, the son you loved.

2085
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:10,209
'We would have been married

2086
02:38:10,329 --> 02:38:12,025
'and I grieve his death every day,

2087
02:38:12,145 --> 02:38:14,308
'as I know both you and Edward do.

2088
02:38:16,246 --> 02:38:18,210
'I will have William's child very soon

2089
02:38:18,330 --> 02:38:21,087
'and even if you are not able
to welcome me home,

2090
02:38:21,207 --> 02:38:22,647
'could you find it in your heart

2091
02:38:22,767 --> 02:38:24,350
'to take the child into your care?

2092
02:38:25,955 --> 02:38:29,348
'I feel such love already
for this little boy or girl,

2093
02:38:29,862 --> 02:38:31,714
'so eager to enter the world

2094
02:38:32,891 --> 02:38:34,712
'and hope that you might forget
your rage

2095
02:38:34,832 --> 02:38:36,350
'and love your grandchild, too.

2096
02:38:37,830 --> 02:38:39,480
'And perhaps for Edward,

2097
02:38:40,081 --> 02:38:41,989
'meeting his little
half-brother or sister

2098
02:38:42,146 --> 02:38:45,796
'may go some way
to healing the loss of his father.

2099
02:38:48,080 --> 02:38:51,685
'I miss you and my sweetest
sister Rose so very much.

2100
02:38:55,313 --> 02:38:57,189
'Your devoted ward, Agnes Leeford.'

2101
02:39:06,782 --> 02:39:08,168
Well, Edward...

2102
02:39:10,831 --> 02:39:12,390
What have you to say?

2103
02:39:19,027 --> 02:39:20,365
Oh, Grandfather.

2104
02:39:23,912 --> 02:39:25,350
They are forgeries.

2105
02:39:25,956 --> 02:39:27,830
Liar! Liar!

2106
02:39:28,090 --> 02:39:30,950
Miss Rose, no! He's not worth it!

2107
02:39:33,971 --> 02:39:35,349
Come with me, Edward.

2108
02:39:43,757 --> 02:39:45,596
What extraordinary behaviour.

2109
02:39:45,716 --> 02:39:48,710
I may have to reconsider
my intentions to make Rose my wife.

2110
02:39:53,153 --> 02:39:54,956
You have no idea

2111
02:39:55,141 --> 02:39:58,184
of the web of falsehoods
that I've encountered.

2112
02:39:58,569 --> 02:40:01,310
- Agnes' locket.
- Taken from her body.

2113
02:40:01,679 --> 02:40:03,898
There is no limit
to some people's avarice.

2114
02:40:04,018 --> 02:40:06,282
And those papers are clearly doctored.

2115
02:40:06,402 --> 02:40:10,030
That is why I tried to burn them.
I was trying to protect you

2116
02:40:10,290 --> 02:40:12,744
from what is clearly
some iniquitous plot.

2117
02:40:14,625 --> 02:40:16,903
And I wouldn't be surprised to learn

2118
02:40:17,431 --> 02:40:19,870
that Rose herself is involved.

2119
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:22,776
God Almighty!

2120
02:40:22,896 --> 02:40:25,950
Not one word of truth
has come from your mouth!

2121
02:40:26,641 --> 02:40:28,910
Everything is known!

2122
02:40:29,389 --> 02:40:32,085
You have conspired to murder a child

2123
02:40:32,205 --> 02:40:34,027
because he stood in your way.

2124
02:40:34,147 --> 02:40:35,275
Because of you,

2125
02:40:35,395 --> 02:40:38,337
a brave and honest young woman
has met a savage death.

2126
02:40:38,457 --> 02:40:40,400
And you accuse Rose?!

2127
02:40:41,642 --> 02:40:44,110
You have blood on your hands, Sir,

2128
02:40:44,521 --> 02:40:45,977
have you no shame?

2129
02:40:46,097 --> 02:40:47,713
How can I be ashamed, Sir,

2130
02:40:47,833 --> 02:40:50,483
- when I am innocent?
- And still you lie!

2131
02:40:50,646 --> 02:40:52,796
I can barely look at you, Edward.

2132
02:40:53,211 --> 02:40:55,526
The evil you intended for Oliver

2133
02:40:55,646 --> 02:40:58,596
- and this is your half-brother!
- He is vermin!

2134
02:40:59,148 --> 02:41:00,464
He is an illegitimate maggot

2135
02:41:00,584 --> 02:41:03,234
who would eat his way
through what is mine.

2136
02:41:03,892 --> 02:41:06,910
And at last, we have the truth.

2137
02:41:09,210 --> 02:41:10,562
I disown you.

2138
02:41:11,580 --> 02:41:14,330
You are no longer
the beneficiary of my will.

2139
02:41:14,518 --> 02:41:16,213
You are no longer my heir.

2140
02:41:16,333 --> 02:41:18,898
When we find him, and we will find him,

2141
02:41:19,018 --> 02:41:21,150
it will all go to Oliver.

2142
02:41:22,396 --> 02:41:23,869
You cannot do this! This is mine!

2143
02:41:24,021 --> 02:41:25,797
- This is my house.
- You will leave now

2144
02:41:25,917 --> 02:41:28,588
and remain in custody
until a ship sails for the Indies.

2145
02:41:28,708 --> 02:41:31,429
You will travel to my holdings.
You will stay there

2146
02:41:31,690 --> 02:41:34,212
and never set foot upon
these shores again.

2147
02:41:34,332 --> 02:41:37,189
Should you attempt to return,
I will have you arrested.

2148
02:41:44,848 --> 02:41:46,521
Grandfather, I beg you...

2149
02:41:46,646 --> 02:41:47,842
to reconsider.

2150
02:41:48,898 --> 02:41:51,956
Perhaps this is exactly what I needed

2151
02:41:52,414 --> 02:41:53,910
to bring me to my senses.

2152
02:41:55,209 --> 02:41:57,559
Please, Grandfather, do not disown me!

2153
02:41:58,543 --> 02:41:59,543
Pity me...

2154
02:42:00,116 --> 02:42:01,310
for my weakness!

2155
02:42:02,086 --> 02:42:04,572
You care for no-one but yourself!

2156
02:42:05,817 --> 02:42:09,327
Your arrogance and cruelty is repulsive.

2157
02:42:10,333 --> 02:42:11,652
You've hidden your true

2158
02:42:11,772 --> 02:42:14,022
character from me very well, Edward.

2159
02:42:15,244 --> 02:42:17,370
It must have amused you greatly.

2160
02:42:19,307 --> 02:42:21,867
I had to do something
to entertain myself

2161
02:42:22,994 --> 02:42:25,310
while I was waiting for you to die.

2162
02:42:27,647 --> 02:42:30,108
The wait has been in vain.

2163
02:42:39,022 --> 02:42:40,044
Goodbye...

2164
02:42:41,617 --> 02:42:42,780
Mr Monks.

2165
02:43:02,087 --> 02:43:03,931
No tender farewell, Rose?

2166
02:43:18,216 --> 02:43:19,731
We will find Oliver.

2167
02:43:20,530 --> 02:43:22,279
Whatever it takes,

2168
02:43:23,265 --> 02:43:24,616
we will find him.

2169
02:43:48,589 --> 02:43:49,845
They feed me

2170
02:43:50,538 --> 02:43:54,030
crusts soaked in bacon fat, Dodger.

2171
02:43:54,966 --> 02:43:55,966
Bacon!

2172
02:43:56,843 --> 02:43:58,189
They laugh at me.

2173
02:43:58,412 --> 02:44:00,949
You just got to sit tight,
ain't ya, Fagey?

2174
02:44:01,691 --> 02:44:03,473
Grit your teeth. Till you get out.

2175
02:44:03,593 --> 02:44:05,143
I need coin, my dear.

2176
02:44:05,810 --> 02:44:09,760
For legal representation in the court.
A lawyer.

2177
02:44:10,280 --> 02:44:12,589
- There must be money.
- There ain't none, Fagey.

2178
02:44:12,850 --> 02:44:14,852
There ain't nothing to fence.

2179
02:44:15,154 --> 02:44:16,804
And I'd get some, but...

2180
02:44:17,653 --> 02:44:19,803
These ain't working right, Fagey.

2181
02:44:20,491 --> 02:44:21,947
I've lost the knack.

2182
02:44:29,214 --> 02:44:30,214
Fagey.

2183
02:44:31,279 --> 02:44:32,483
Nancy's dead.

2184
02:44:35,153 --> 02:44:36,898
And they killed my bird.

2185
02:44:38,032 --> 02:44:39,032
Ezekiel.

2186
02:44:39,777 --> 02:44:41,788
My dearest dear

2187
02:44:42,403 --> 02:44:44,590
what I raised from the nest.

2188
02:44:46,062 --> 02:44:48,283
- Are you sure there is no money?
- We're potless.

2189
02:44:48,403 --> 02:44:49,533
I used the last of it

2190
02:44:49,653 --> 02:44:51,596
bribing the screw to get into see ya.

2191
02:44:51,716 --> 02:44:53,466
Then the boy, young Nolly.

2192
02:44:53,592 --> 02:44:55,150
You must find him for me,

2193
02:44:55,410 --> 02:44:56,983
he can vouch for me to the Beak.

2194
02:44:57,103 --> 02:44:59,190
He can tell how I fed him, clothed him,

2195
02:44:59,450 --> 02:45:00,971
- gave him a bed.
- Time's up.

2196
02:45:01,091 --> 02:45:02,829
He can tell how I showed charity!

2197
02:45:03,342 --> 02:45:04,974
You must find him, Dodger!

2198
02:45:05,094 --> 02:45:08,346
- Nolly is the key!
- On my life, Fagey!

2199
02:45:08,466 --> 02:45:09,970
I won't let ya down!

2200
02:45:13,650 --> 02:45:16,442
# Fast falls the eventide #

2201
02:45:17,384 --> 02:45:19,830
# The darkness deepens #

2202
02:45:20,779 --> 02:45:23,350
# Lord, with me abide #

2203
02:45:24,091 --> 02:45:26,909
# When other helpers fail #

2204
02:45:27,226 --> 02:45:29,633
# And comforts flee #

2205
02:45:30,528 --> 02:45:36,070
# Help ofthe helpless
Oh, abide with me... #

2206
02:45:39,109 --> 02:45:40,729
Go on! Get out of it!

2207
02:45:41,844 --> 02:45:43,294
Get gone, I tell ya!

2208
02:45:45,262 --> 02:45:46,350
What you looking at?

2209
02:45:47,152 --> 02:45:48,802
I'll have yer eyes out!

2210
02:45:50,428 --> 02:45:51,708
I'm Bill Sikes!

2211
02:45:54,371 --> 02:45:55,862
Nobody looks at me!

2212
02:45:56,277 --> 02:45:58,909
- I'll have the lot of ya!
- Bill Sikes?!

2213
02:47:09,602 --> 02:47:10,530
Nolly!

2214
02:47:10,650 --> 02:47:12,097
- Nolly, wait!
- Leave me alone.

2215
02:47:12,217 --> 02:47:13,282
You have to help!

2216
02:47:13,402 --> 02:47:15,223
I'm sorry for all what happened!
I'm sorry!

2217
02:47:15,343 --> 02:47:16,629
We're mukkers, ain't we?

2218
02:47:17,211 --> 02:47:18,280
Stick together!

2219
02:47:18,723 --> 02:47:20,695
Nolly, please! I promised him!

2220
02:47:20,815 --> 02:47:23,290
- I have to go.
- It's for Fagey!

2221
02:47:38,618 --> 02:47:40,555
Members of the jury...

2222
02:47:40,990 --> 02:47:45,097
Do you find the defendant,
Fagin the Jew,

2223
02:47:45,334 --> 02:47:48,357
guilty or not guilty

2224
02:47:49,171 --> 02:47:54,024
of dealing in stolen property,
consorting with known felons

2225
02:47:54,144 --> 02:47:56,387
and abduction and conspiracy

2226
02:47:56,507 --> 02:47:59,527
to murder a Christian child?

2227
02:48:02,528 --> 02:48:05,510
Guilty on all counts.

2228
02:48:13,346 --> 02:48:14,796
Prisoner at the bar,

2229
02:48:15,739 --> 02:48:17,749
before I pass sentence,

2230
02:48:18,095 --> 02:48:21,630
you may make a plea for clemency.

2231
02:48:22,609 --> 02:48:23,609
Thank you,

2232
02:48:24,417 --> 02:48:26,449
thank you, Mr Fang.

2233
02:48:27,592 --> 02:48:28,592
You see,

2234
02:48:29,217 --> 02:48:31,272
I never meant no hurt.

2235
02:48:32,131 --> 02:48:33,962
I would never have hurt...

2236
02:48:34,851 --> 02:48:36,412
I hoped for a reward,

2237
02:48:36,532 --> 02:48:38,019
for keeping him safe.

2238
02:48:38,139 --> 02:48:40,689
I... I would never have hurt.

2239
02:48:40,971 --> 02:48:42,189
You wish for mercy.

2240
02:48:42,905 --> 02:48:43,905
I do, Sir,

2241
02:48:45,417 --> 02:48:46,459
I do, I...

2242
02:48:48,097 --> 02:48:50,430
I don't want to die, Sir.

2243
02:48:51,229 --> 02:48:53,930
- I don't.
- Then ask Christ.

2244
02:48:54,845 --> 02:48:57,580
Fall to your knees, before this assembly

2245
02:48:57,700 --> 02:49:00,430
and take Christ as your saviour.

2246
02:49:01,031 --> 02:49:02,572
Renounce your faith,

2247
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:04,187
your God.

2248
02:49:05,317 --> 02:49:07,225
Pray to Christ, Fagin.

2249
02:49:16,812 --> 02:49:18,150
I can't do that.

2250
02:50:04,646 --> 02:50:06,534
# Abide with me #

2251
02:50:08,595 --> 02:50:12,064
# Fast falls the eventide... #

2252
02:50:15,050 --> 02:50:16,510
I won't never leave you, Bill.

2253
02:50:18,586 --> 02:50:20,304
Ain't it I'm your girl?

2254
02:50:26,970 --> 02:50:28,004
Billy...

2255
02:50:28,497 --> 02:50:29,683
D'you love me?

2256
02:50:54,611 --> 02:50:56,536
I just wanted to say sorry.

2257
02:50:58,325 --> 02:50:59,787
Cos I didn't steal of off you.

2258
02:50:59,907 --> 02:51:01,887
He's here! Oliver's here!

2259
02:51:02,157 --> 02:51:04,912
We've been looking for you,
we've been so worried.

2260
02:51:05,032 --> 02:51:07,688
- Looking for me?
- Yes, for you.

2261
02:51:08,392 --> 02:51:09,825
And here you are!

2262
02:51:12,584 --> 02:51:13,981
You've come home!

2263
02:51:15,132 --> 02:51:16,709
Oh, you've come home.

2264
02:51:17,375 --> 02:51:18,494
Mrs Bedwin!

2265
02:51:21,148 --> 02:51:22,357
Oh, he's safe!

2266
02:51:34,854 --> 02:51:37,461
Hang him! Hang him!

2267
02:51:48,085 --> 02:51:50,138
Stop pushing me!

2268
02:51:53,261 --> 02:51:55,656
I wanna see him die!

2269
02:52:05,526 --> 02:52:06,618
My Dodge...

2270
02:52:08,238 --> 02:52:09,238
My dear.

2271
02:52:40,912 --> 02:52:41,912
Bull's-eye.

2272
02:52:55,272 --> 02:52:56,517
Out of my way!

2273
02:53:20,379 --> 02:53:21,629
Goodbye, Agnes.

2274
02:53:29,091 --> 02:53:30,418
Goodbye, Nancy.

2275
02:54:11,133 --> 02:54:12,624
What are you looking at?!

2276
02:54:12,744 --> 02:54:14,389
I'll have your eyes!

2277
02:54:22,980 --> 02:54:26,244
Now, the marriage begins in earnest.

2278
02:54:26,364 --> 02:54:27,744
Indeed it does.

2279
02:54:27,864 --> 02:54:31,196
Days of merriment
and nights of connubial bliss.

2280
02:54:35,306 --> 02:54:37,156
Stoke up the fire, husband.

2281
02:54:37,622 --> 02:54:38,650
Madam.

2282
02:54:45,183 --> 02:54:46,183
Madam?!

2283
02:54:46,303 --> 02:54:49,066
It's just a bit of fun, go on,
I won't do it again.

2284
02:54:49,288 --> 02:54:50,663
Stoke up the fire.

2285
02:55:27,851 --> 02:55:28,910
Bravo!

2286
02:55:29,858 --> 02:55:31,795
Encore!

2287
02:55:34,026 --> 02:55:35,764
Bravo!

2288
02:55:36,246 --> 02:55:37,950
Bravo!

2289
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:40,923
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

2290
02:55:41,043 --> 02:55:43,070
Merry Christmas, everyone!
