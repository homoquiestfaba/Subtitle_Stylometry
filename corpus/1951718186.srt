<i>[ Man Narrating ]
1961. The Cold War rages...</i>

2
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,800
<i>between the United States
and the Communist powers.</i>

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,300
<i>It is a war of nerves, of threats
and bluffs, of military bluster.</i>

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,700
<i>Armies and ominous tanks
line the streets of Moscow...</i>

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>as do missiles with warheads...</i>

6
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
<i>carrying the promise
of mass destruction.</i>

7
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>It is an era of intrigue
and espionage.</i>

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,800
<i>Soviet spies are routinely
trapped and sent to prisons.</i>

9
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,300
<i>Or they are exchanged
for American spies...</i>

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,100
<i>incarcerated
behind the Iron Curtain.</i>

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,900
<i>Tensions culminate
with the shooting down...</i>

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,200
<i>of an American high-altitude
reconnaissance plane...</i>

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
<i>while a U.N. ambassador,
Henry Cabot Lodge...</i>

14
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,600
<i>shows a hidden microphone the Reds
disguised in the great seal at an embassy.</i>

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,700
<i>One slip in the world
of Cold War diplomacy...</i>

21
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>could lead instantly
to nuclear disaster.</i>

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,500
<i>One such free outpost...</i>

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,700
<i>deep in Communism's fanatic,
totalitarian underbelly...</i>

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,100
<i>is where our story takes place.</i>

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>Here in a quaint but sturdy mansion
of traditional structure...</i>

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
<i>a dedicated and disciplined group
of foreign-service workers...</i>

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,900

<i>of international relations

30
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,000
<i>It is in this small haven

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,200
<i>asylum is given and gracious dinners with
dignitaries from all over the world...</i>

32

<i>are a part of Uncle Sam's

33

<i>The embassy is run by U.S. Ambassador

35

<i>- Soon it'll be fall in Paris.
- [ Man ] Yes, sir.</i>

37
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,700
<i>I wish we were at
the embassy in Paris too, sir.</i>

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,700
Well, don't.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,100
Because this is where the war is going
to be won or lost with the Reds.

40
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,200
- They don't need top diplomats
at the Folies-Bergére.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,000
I didn't mean to imply that the work
we're doing here is not significant.

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,000
We've got a job to do,
and we're going to do it.

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
- And we're going to do it
better than anybody else.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Here are those allocations
you requested.

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,600
<i>[ Narrator ] In addition to Mr. Burns,
Ambassador Magee is ably abetted...</i>

46
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,700
<i>by Mr.John Kilroy, Yale '49.</i>

47
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,100
<i>And Miss Rosemary Pritchard.</i>

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,500
<i>Mr. Kilroy's view of Karl Marx is
rather straightforward and simple...</i>

49
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,100
<i>and reflects that
of Mr.John Wayne.</i>

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,400
The only good Communist

- Oh!

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,500
- Ah!
- God!

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,700
See, I told you.
It's the fourth one this year.

<i>- [ Knocking ]

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,900
<i>- You sent for me, sir?
- Sit down.</i>

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,200
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,300
<i>Because of my superior record here,
my accomplishments...</i>

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,200
the leaders of my party are discussing
the possibility of a cabinet position for me.

63
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Of course, this is
all very hush-hush.

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>Well, sir, let me say I think you'd be
a wonderful asset to the president.</i>

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,100
Your broad outlook would appeal to psychotic
liberals as well as militant fascists.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,100
Something for everyone.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,600
<i>Don't mind telling you
this would be a crowning jewel
in a lifetime of foreign service.</i>

68
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,600
<i>- Naturally.
- Closing the deal, however...</i>

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,800
will take considerable effort
on my part.

70
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,700
You know how it is.
The right dinner parties.

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,800
Golf course.
Calling in a few favors.

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Naturally, my presence
in Washington will be essential.

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,900
Sir, I understand,
and I won't let you down.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,700
I'm tempted to leave
Mr. Kilroy in charge...

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
but I don't think that would
look very good image-wise.

76
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,300
Dad-- Sir, I realize that my record
at various embassies...

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
has been less than perfect,
but what can go wrong in two weeks?

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,700
You were in Brazil for two weeks,
and you had them importing coffee.

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,900
- No, see, that was--
- My own son who I raised
to be a diplomat...

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,300
- was asked to leave Africa.
- Don't get worked up, Dad.

81
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,500
Some of the best men
in foreign service have...

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
at one time or another,
been asked to leave a country.

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,900
Africa is a continent. You were
recalled from an entire continent.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not really a natural
at it, like you are.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,800
You were hung in effigy in Panama!
Even I didn't know that.

86
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,100
- I told you that.
- Yes, but you didn't tell me
it was by our own embassy!

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,200
Dad, you've been more than tolerant.

88
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,600
- I realize I've had
a hard time finding myself.
- [ Coughing ]

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Sorry. A little reflux.

90
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,600
If you could just
give me this one chance.

91
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,600
- Take this.
- That's glue.

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You can trust me, sir.

Mr. Kilroy?

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,800
In the ambassador's absence,
I will be in charge here.

96
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,300
Now I realize there's some
discrepancy in our experience...

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,900
and I don't want that to cause
any awkwardness or resentment.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,800
I intend to run a disciplined ship,
but a fair one.

99
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,400
Now the word around here is that
you don't really approve of me.

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,400
Am I to believe that?

101
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
You can speak freely.

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,200
I encourage my staff
to honestly express themselves...

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,800
<i>in an environment
of open frankness.</i>

104

<i>what do you think of me?</i>

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think you're a moron. Totally
unsuited to the diplomatic corps.

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
Unequal to the task
of fighting Communism.

Clinging desperately
to a disastrous career...

109

through the good graces
of your father's connections.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,700
In short, despite
your family's advantages...

111
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,200
a born failure.

112
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,900
Ah. You needn't hide your feelings...

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,900

Yeah. Yes.

Thank you for being so candid.

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,900
You know, it's refreshing
when someone despises you...

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,100
to hear it phrased so succinctly.

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,500
<i>[ Narrator ] And so Ambassador Magee

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,800
I don't have the facts. I can't commit
to anything without the facts.

164
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,400
- [ Soldiers Shouting ]
- I'm in charge! This will all be settled!

165
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,700
You invade our sanctity
with weapons?

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,700
You wonder how a brutal
dictatorship gets a bad name.

167
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
- Okay, that's enough. Come on.
- That's enough.

168
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,800
[ Shouting ]

169
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,500
You have to deny it!
You can't be indecisive!

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,500
I wasn't indecisive.
I just couldn't make a decision.

171
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,000
Our government has a fixed policy
regarding espionage.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you tell them we're spies?

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,700
[ Woman ] Will you stop?
He's always eavesdropping.

174
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
He didn't deny it. They said
we're spies. They say we're spies.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
How can I spy? With my eyesight,
I'm gonna be a spy?

176
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,400
I didn't tell them you were spies. First
rule, Mr. Kilroy, keep your options open.

177
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
First no movie on the plane,
now this.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is all just
a simple misunderstanding.

179
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Simple? What do you mean, simple?
How simple?

180
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,700
If we leave the building, they shoot us.
Is that simple enough?

181
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,300
First there'd be like a show trial,
then they'd shoot you.

182
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
- Who is this guy?
- Perhaps we should notify
Ambassador Magee.

183
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,200
- That will not be necessary.
- A man takes his family on a vacation...

184
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,800
and this is what we have
working in our government.

185
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,600
- Then they wonder why I don't vote.
- I have done nothing wrong here.

186
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,100
- Me neither.
- Why did you take pictures?
You knew it was forbidden.

187
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,400
I didn't think they'd see.
I have a Minox.

188
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,900
- What did you think
when the sirens went off?
- I thought it was lunch break.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,900
- What did you photograph?
- Nothing. The sunset.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,900
If you knew it was a sunset,
how could the sirens be lunch?

191
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
Leave me alone because
I got a headache.

192
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,700
They're paranoid, and you're
a nudge for the whole trip.

193
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,000
You know, he's right. He is right.
Everything, they hide.

194
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know why
I listen to you in the first place.

195
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Every time I listen to what you say,
I wind up behind the eight ball.

196
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
- Here we go again.
- A man has a vacation.

197
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,900
He wants to take his family someplace.
I said we'll get a cabana
in Atlantic Beach.

198
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Every year it has to be
Atlantic Beach?

199
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,700
To what? Sit in the sun and hear you
complain about over-freckling?

200
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
No, this is better.
Europe is better.

201
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,000
$6,000 for three weeks
of uninterrupted diarrhea.

202
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
What's so terrible? My brother
suggested we see Europe.

203
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,900
- He had a wonderful time.
- I have to live for her brother.
Do you hear this?

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,900
- That's a hot one.
- I know you folks are excited--

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,400
- Sorry.
- That's all right. I gotta
get a few facts here.

206
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Hollander.
Newark, New Jersey.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
I'll give you the facts.
The facts are I get a vacation.

208
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,200
I want to take my family someplace.
So I say we'll go to Atlantic Beach.

209
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,600
We'll swim. There's miniature golf.
We can play pinochle.

210
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,400
No! Her brother says go to Europe.
We gotta go to Eur--

211
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,800
And we must-- He tells us we must go
behind the Iron Curtain.

212
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,300
Meanwhile, on his vacation,
he went to the French Riviera.

213
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,800
Aren't you interested to see
how the other half lives?

214
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,400
We went with you
to the Crazy Horse in Paris.

215
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,900
A striptease joint. He takes me to
where women get completely naked.

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Are you comparing Communism
to those girls?

217
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,800
As if he appreciates Europe anyway.

218
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
We took him to Westminster Abbey,
his feet hurt.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,100
We took him to Buckingham Palace,
he tried to make the guards laugh.

220
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,300
We took him to the Sistine Chapel,
he never saw the mural.

221
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,400
The mural's on the ceiling.
I can't look up. I get dizzy.

222
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,300
- He had to paint the mural
on the ceiling?
- In the Louvre...

223
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,500
I took him to see the statue
of Venus de Milo.

224
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,400
I turn away for one minute,
he's caressing the bosom.

225
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,400
- She cannot take a joke.
- The man is caressing the bosom.

226
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,900
Yes, I felt the statue.
She cannot take a joke.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,100
Have either you ever had any stomach
ailments or respiratory problems?

228
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,000
- What is he doing?
- I have this brother--
You see, I have this brother.

229
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>- He's a wonderful man.
- He's a Nazi.</i>

230
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,800
- Do you know what you're talking about?
- He should be wearing an armband.

231
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,200
- Take my word for it.
- Here we go. ''Request for Asylum.''

232
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,300
What about asylum? I'm a caterer
from New Jersey. What do I need asylum?

233
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm gonna need your passports,
and I gotta get some other information.

234
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm giving information.
It began with my brother.

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
- He's quite a lovely individual.
- They should have hung him at Nuremberg.

236
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,700
''Have you ever bought anything
on credit?'' What the hell is this?

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,700
What is what I--
What are we doing here?

238
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,200
A man goes on a vacation--
This is crazy.

239
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,000
- You know, here. Who has the passports?
- That's fine.

240
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,400
Hollander and Blackwell.
I'm a caterer from Newark.

241
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,100
Take my card.
You'll find us in--

242
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,500
- Here.
- Great. Do you work, Mrs. Hollander?

243
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,800
No, no, sir.
I'm an average housewife.

244
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,200
She's a professional
mah-jongg hustler.

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,300
She travels around
with her own tiles in a case.

246
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,500
Okay, now, you innocently
snapped some photos? Is that--

247
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,700
Yes, we wandered away
from a guided tour.

248
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,200
- His sense of direction is terrible.
- What are you telling him this for?

249
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,600
Will you listen to me, Mr. Magee?
He starts out driving to the Catskills...

250
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,800
- and he winds up in the Adirondacks.
- She has all the answers.

251
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,700
Then they started to chase you, and
you had the good sense to come here.

252
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,300
- My daughter had the presence of mind.
- It's a good thing she did.

253
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,800
So you could tell her we're spies,
'cause you don't deny it.

254
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,400
- I didn't say anything.
- My wife should not
have to go through this.

255
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,900
- She's not a young woman.
- What do you mean, I'm an old woman?

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not saying old. You're not old,
but she had bridge work recently.

257
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Look, I just don't think
there's anything to worry about.

258
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,100
Sure, 'cause I'm a caterer, not a spy.

259
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Creative catering is our specialty.

260
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,800
We were the first to make
the bridgegroom out of potato salad.

261
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,800
He does lovely work.
I'll have to say that for him.

262
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,500
Last month we did an affair. I made
the bridegroom from potato salad.

263
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,800
The head was a jello mold,
and there was a clam dip...

264
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,800
that we did
the rest of the body in.

265
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,500
Fruit punch spouting--

266
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
- It was a marvelous affair.
- Beautiful. It was.

267
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,900
I should be able to straighten
this out in a few days.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,500
A few days? What are you, nuts?
I'm not gonna stay here a few days.

269
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
We'll have Mr. Burns
set up some cots.

270
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,800
Cots! This is getting
worse and worse.

271
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,100
I can't sleep on a cot. I'm a dignified
human being with a hernia.

272
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,100
Mr. Hollander, this is an emergency.
We're gonna try the best we can, okay?

273
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,400
No, I can't stay here.
This is the height of the season.

274
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Sam Blackwell can't run
the business without me.

275
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Look, he's a wonderful man.

276
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,600
I have respect for him. He's my partner.
He's a lovely individual...

277
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,000
but the man is a total
abject imbecile.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,500
It'll be all right.
Alvin'll come in. His son'll come in.

279
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,300
- He's over 21 .
- Son? Who's gonna dress him?
He's dumber than his father.

280
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,400
- I'm sure the business
can wait a couple of days.
- Folks, that's it for me.

281
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,200
I'm sorry if I damaged anything,
but now I'm going to America.

282
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Mr. Magee, what do you
think's gonna happen?

283
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,200
- I'm a caterer. Let 'em capture me.
- This is preposterous.

284
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,400
They want information, I'll tell them
how to make grapefruit sections.

285
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,200
- Mr. Hollander, you
can't just go out there.
- You know what? Let him go.

286
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,000
Go ahead, big shot. Listen,
we'll be in here if you want us.

287
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,600
- Go ahead. There's the front door.
- You think I'm afraid to go out?

288
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,600
- I'm afraid--
- No. Why should you be afraid?

289
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,600
They're only police. They'll arrest you,
torture you. What's to be afraid of?

290
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,000
- Yeah, I'm afraid.
- No. Mrs. Hollander--

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
Go ahead. Go, go.
Get brainwashed.

292
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,100
In your case,
it'll probably help.

293
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,800
- I urge you not to do anything rash.
- Let him go. Go ahead.

294
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,500
- You don't think I'll go?
- Good-bye! Go!

295
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,900
Do you know if any of those guys
belong to the Masons?

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,100
- Ach, you're starting with the Masons.
- The Masons!

297
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,100
<i>- Here they are. Everything's fine.
- Where have you been?</i>

298
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry. They had me upstairs.
You wouldn't believe what's outside.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
Like 1 2 armies
all with their guns drawn.

300
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
- You're all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Ma. I'm fine.

301
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,600
Mr. Magee, this is
my daughter Susan.

302
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,500
- She was a cesarean.
- Pleased. Axel Magee.

303
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,400
- When will we be free to go home?
- Well, home--

304
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,400
Tell her, tell her. We're liable
to be here two, three days.

305
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,000
- Two, three days? What about Seth?
- Seth?

306
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Seth. Our son Seth.
You remem--

307
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,800
Forgive my wife. In her panic, she
forgot that she gave birth twice.

308
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,500
<i>No, no, I-I didn't think
'cause he's at camp.</i>

309
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,500
Camp ends tomorrow.
What are you talking about?

310
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
The kid'll be home.
He'll be unsupervised.

311
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,300
We're here. He's in the streets.
He'll be running amok.

312
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,500
He'll be raping and looting.
This kid takes after her brother.

313
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,700
<i>Oh, my God. And Susan's
getting married in two weeks.</i>

314
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,000
That's right. I have a deposit
on the hall. Now what?

315
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,500
If we're squeezed for time, we'll
have to push it back. That's what.

316
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,300
The date's been set.
We're not pushing anything.

317
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,100
Maybe she's right. We may
be able to push the date back.

318
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,100
So you better call the owner of
the Renaissance Luau and deal with it.

319
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,300
What are we talking about?
Call Donald.

320
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,100
<i>- Tell him that-- He'll be worried sick.
- Okay, I'll call Donald.</i>

321
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
<i>Mr. Magee, what's the longest
anyone's had to stay here?</i>

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Uh, we have a priest
who came to us for asylum.

323
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,300
He's been living upstairs
for a while.

324
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,500
What is ''a while''?

325
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
<i>- A while.
- [ Mrs. Hollander ] How long?</i>

326
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,900
Uh, [ Exhales ] six years.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>- Six years.
- Oh, my God.</i>

328
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,300
I said let's go to Atlantic Beach.
We'll swim, we'll play pinochle.

329
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,400
No! Her brother says go to Europe.

330
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>- May he rest in peace.
- He's not dead.</i>

331
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,500
He will be as soon as I get back.

332
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,200
<i>I saw it. It was a tiny camera.</i>

333
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't understand. Why is there
no electronic surveillance report?

334
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,400
Unfortunately, they must have discovered
the wires. We're getting nothing.

335
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,600
They don't appear to be spies.
They look like a family.

336
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,700
<i>I wouldn't be taken in by appearances.
Note how careful the executive officer was...</i>

337
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to avoid denying any accusation.

338
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,500
Absolutely correct.
What puzzles me is...

339
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,500
how he knew to take pictures
at that exact intersection?

340
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,500
<i>There must be spies
amongst our own ranks.</i>

341
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,100
I've long suspected people
in our own organization.

342
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,700
Leaks now can prove fatal.

343
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,100
<i>I want the photos
and I want Hollanders.</i>

344
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
What I'm afraid of is that
before we can move...

345
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,700
they will be used in an exchange
for certain agents the K.G.B. must--

346
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,400
Once in our possession,
the Hollanders will talk.

347
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,700
And then heads will roll.

348
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,800
So then they shot at Walter,
and we raced down the block.

349
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,900
They're horrible Communists...

350
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,700
with secret police and
those vicious dogs and... God knows.

351
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,100
We may be stuck here for years,
so save the puzzles.

352
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
No, it's really
a beautiful place, Carol.

353
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,000
They set up these kind
of fold-out beds for us...

354
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,600
in this conference room library.

355
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,000
You'd love Mr. Magee.
He's really very attractive.

356
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
[ Sighing ]
I don't know if I miss Donald.

357
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,300
Don't even ask me that question.
Then I get all confused.

358
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,900
The migraines come back.

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So how are things in Newark?

360
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Elsie?

361
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Elsie, here's what I want you to do.

362
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I want you to go--
I want you to go into my bedroom...

363
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,000
and look under my pillow.

364
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,800
Look under the pillow.
Do you--

365
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,200
There's a small piece of gray flannel.

366
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,100
I want you to take it and wrap it up.
I want you to mail it to me.

367
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,000
Because I'm under tremendous stress...

368
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,900
and I know I'm not gonna be able to
sleep unless I have my piece of flannel.

369
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,100
Yeah, piece of flannel.

370
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,400
Where I suck the tip.

371
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,100
<i>[ Kilroy ] They're taking a very
hard line. Obviously, it's strategic.</i>

372
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,900
<i>What did Washington say?</i>

373
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,200
Well, the truth is, I haven't
contacted the home office yet.

374
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,900
- A formal complaint is in order.
- We have time, Mr. Kilroy.

375
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,200
Then I strongly suggest we cancel
plans to host the emir.

376
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,200
Our Arab friends
can be unpredictable.

377
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,300
I think it would be an extreme loss
of face for the emir...

378
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,500
if he were suddenly not permitted
to be our country's guest.

379
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,200
It's a question of space. The emir
will take up the whole third floor.

380
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,200
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- No. Hi. Come in.

381
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,900
- Are you sure? 'Cause--
- Yeah.

382
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,900
Mr. Kilroy, we can--
We'll work this out later.

383
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
As you wish.

384
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,700
- Am I interrupting? I can come back.
- No, it's fine.

385
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,500
- 'Cause I don't want to take up
too much of your time.
- No problem.

386
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,100
I just wanted to thank you
for the accommodations.
Everyone's been really nice.

387
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,200
- Oh, good.
- It's a lovely place to be
under the right circumstances.

388
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
- We'll try to get you out
of here as soon as we can.
- We really appreciate it.

389
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,100
- Your dad is really anxious.
- My da-- Oh.

390
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,000
No, he's like that all the time.
My parents--

391
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,600
Well, they're not like that
all the time. I mean...

392
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,300
they kind of have a funny way
of communicating with each other.

393
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,200
Deep down, they're affectionate.
They really like each other...

394
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,200
but, I don't know, what you see
is what I envision the Huns to be.

395
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah, well, you know,
it's gotta be hard for them.

396
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,000
Oh, would you like
something to drink?

397
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,600
We've got a local white wine.
It's, uh...

398
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,000
light, but kind of sneaks up on you.

399
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,400
Oh, I could use something serious.
Thank you.

400
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
So--

401
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,000
What do you do?

402
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,600
Uh, not a lot. I majored
in philosophy at Rutgers...

403
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,700
and now I don't feel equipped
to do much of anything...

404
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,600
except think about
the universe, which I do.

405
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,300
I don't know. I could open
a philosophy shop and sell concepts.

406
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
[ Laughs ]

407
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
- So what do you think about--
- What do I think?

408
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,000
- About the universe.
- Oh, um-- [ Scoffs ]

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,300
Well, I think it's a,
you know, rough place to be...

410
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,800
unless, of course, you
have someone to share it with.

411
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,200
That makes it easier.

412
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300
- Fortunately, you do.
- Yes, I do. I hope you do too.

413
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,400
Well, I travel a lot.
Suddenly and unexpectedly.

414
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,300
It must be exciting, you know,
to be in all those different countries.

415
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,500
Mr. Kilroy said you've been in almost
every embassy. That's really amazing.

416
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,900
- He said that? Well, not every embassy.
- [ Coughs ]

417
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,900
It doesn't sneak up on you,
it just attacks.

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,200
- You haven't eaten, right?
- Look how quickly I'm
talking personally with you.

419
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,500
<i>- I don't like to be forward.
- Don't be silly.</i>

420
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Wine or no wine,
I promise, no more questions.

421
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,600
<i>- What school did you go to?
- Harvard.</i>

422
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>I wanted to go to art school,
but my family had other plans.</i>

423
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,500
Oh. [ Chuckles ]
That's too bad.

424
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
What does your fiancée do?

425
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,100
Um, I don't--
I don't have a fiancée. You do.

426
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,100
[ Chuckling ] Oh! That's right.
Look at me. I'm drunk already.

427
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
- Notice I'm not asking you questions.
- That's all right.

428
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,600
- So what does he do? Your fiancé.
- Oh, Donald.

429
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,600
He's a dermatologist.
We met at Trader Vic's.

430
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,700
I was choking on some cosmo tidbits.
It's actually an interesting story.

431
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,700
He reached down my throat
and pulled out a toothpick...

432
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,700
with a half-eaten shrimp
on the end of it.

433
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,300
- Huh.
- Later that night, we made love.

434
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Beverly, you heard?

435
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,900
Oh, no, no.
It's a lovely place.

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But if you ask me, whoever
dusts doesn't do a good job.

437
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,900
<i>Leave me alone, please. I don't like
European food. I never liked it.</i>

438
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,200
<i>- So I'm a Philistine.
- [ Axel ] Do we have a problem here?</i>

439
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Every dish I name, he says no.

440
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,600
Mr. Hollander, if you have any
special request, I'm sure Oscar--

441
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,800
We are 4,000 miles
from the United States.

442
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,500
It's a Communist country. It's 8:00
at night. I can't get lean brisket!

443
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,800
- Fish! What about fish?
- Octopus.

444
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
No, not octopus.
Not monsters.

445
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,700
- I mean fish, regular fish.
- Oysters, lovely oysters.

446
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,300
Oysters are alive.
I don't eat live food.

447
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,300
I want my food dead.
Not sick, not wounded. Dead.

448
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,600
<i>- Thejellied calf's foot.
- [ Hangs Up Phone ]</i>

449
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,500
Marion, you hear this? He wants me
to eat a jellied calf's foot.

450
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,900
Because of where we are and who we
entertain, our menu can be a little exotic.

451
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,900
So plain boiled chicken.
Is that so complicated?

452
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,100
<i>[ Marion ] Usually he has
a very nice appetite.</i>

453
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,100
Look how I can't get a meal here.

454
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,100
I'll come in the kitchen.
I'll make you something.

455
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
<i>- In my kitchen?
- Don't worry. I know--</i>

456
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Not in my kitchen. No one
works in my kitchen except me.

457
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,800
The cutlery--
I have everything just so.

458
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,400
My spice rack. You'll mix up
the order of my spice rack.

459
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm getting dizzy. The blinding
headaches are returning.

460
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,700
<i>- I need some water.! Cold water.!
- Marion.</i>

461
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,300
It's good to know our food is
being cooked by an outpatient.

462
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,700
I spoke to Barney Silverman
on the phone.

463
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,000
Did you tell him not to bother
to come to Idyllwild Airport...

464
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,000
with the station wagon
because we may be six years late?

465
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
Mrs. Hollander, I meant to speak
to you about the telephone.

466
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,100
You're free to use the phone
as much as you'd like,
but if you could limit the calls--

467
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
This is nothing for her.
Let me tell you.

468
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,400
She's got to alert everyone in Newark
individually like Paul Revere.

469

You've cut your last melon ball.

627
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
His Majesty has arrived.

628
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,600
Oh, my God-- Allah.
Uh--

629
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,900
Mr. Magee.
Mr. Magee!

630
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,100
<i>[ Walter ] Don't call me.
I've got problems of my own.</i>

631
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,600
No. If you're gonna call,
call me with good news.

632
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,200
No-- Black-- Oh, my--

633
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,200
Blackwell,
I'll call you later.

634
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
<i>What is this?
Lawrence of Arabia?</i>

635
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,700
- How do you do, Your Highness?
- ''Your Highness''?

636
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,500
- You know this guy?
- What are you talking about?
He's some kind of a sultan.

637
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
His Majesty wishes to thank
his American friends...

638
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,800
for much recent generosity
and understanding.

639
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,500
I am aide to His Majesty
and his wives.

640
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,800
- Wives. This bunch here is the wives?
- How do you do? How do you do?

641
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,400
- Can I take your veils?
- I'm Walter Hollander from New Jersey.

642
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,400
Our flight was
a rather rough one.

643
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,600
I hope you didn't have any problem
getting past all those police outside.

644
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,900
Walter and I are wanted.

645
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,300
I recogn-- This guy I recog--
The newspapers--

646
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Didn't you people
have an uprising recently?

647
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
I understand the ambassador
has made arrangements.

648
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm right.
All those workers got--

649
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,100
- There--
- All those workers got killed.

650
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
There are two sides
to that affair, my friend.

651
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
What are you talking about, Walter?
Something you know nothing about?

652
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,600
What are you telling me?
I don't know politics?

653
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Don't you read the papers? This guy
owns the most sand of anyone.

654
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,700
- Your Highness.
- Majesty.

655
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,600
Welcome, Your Majesty.
I'm sorry that we're unprepared.

656
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,700
- We've had some problems.
- Problems of extreme rudeness?

657
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,700
- What's your trouble, Aladdin?
- Mr. Hollander,
leave this room immediately.

658
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,600
No, I'm not gonna go. Why?
'Cause this bum has some oil wells?

659
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,900
I'm an American citizen.
I pay taxes.

660
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,500
- You cheat on your taxes.
- What has that got to do with anything?

661
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,200
Even with my cheating, I overpay.

662
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,200
Your Excellency,
I'm Ambassador Magee's son.

663
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,000
My father's crushed he has to be
in Washington while you're here...

664
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,300
but I'm chief executive officer
in his absence...

665
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,100
and I assure you that the entire embassy
is at your disposal.

666
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,300
Listen, I don't want my government
doing business with this guy.

667
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,900
- I think your government
can decide that for itself.
- I am the government!

668
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,100
Listen to this.
He's the government.

669
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,800
Who do you think the government is?
For crying out loud.

670
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,200
Our government is
little people like you and me.

671
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,800
<i>- Maybe not you.
- [ Aide ] Perhaps
we're intruding in a crisis.</i>

672
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,800
<i>- [ Father Drobney Shouting ]
- No, no. My father-- Father Drobney.!</i>

673
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,200
<i>- I can't get out!
- Mr. Burns, extricate him.</i>

674
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,200
[ Continues Shouting ]

675
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
<i>- How many wives does this guy have?
- You don't--</i>

676
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,500
I count 1 4 wives. How does
he ever get in the bathroom?

677
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,400
I don't know
how Houdini did it!

678
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,400
I want it undone.

679
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,800
I want amends made.
I want him placated...

680
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,500
and I don't want anything
to reach the press.

681
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,200
Axel, I knew it. I knew it.

682
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,500
Yeah, but, Dad--
Okay-- Dad, no, no.

683
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,500
No, I think it's been kept
pretty well under wraps.

684
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,000
It is a crisis.
No, it's a crisis...

685
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,200
but so far, it's our own
private... crisis.

686
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,800
God save your life
if this becomes public.

687
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,900
Any of it. Any of it!
Do you hear me?

688
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,600
The last thing I need is to be
on the front pages for the wrong thing.

689
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
And, Axel.

690
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,000
If relations with the emir
become compromised...

691
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,500
I have friends at the Pentagon
who owe me a favor...

692
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,600
and they will aim
an ICBM at you.

693
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,000
I-I appreciate that.

694
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Good-bye.

695
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Oh, hi.

696
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,400
<i>- Hi.
- What have you got there? You hungry?</i>

697
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,400
Oh, no. Actually, it's for my dad.

698
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,300
He didn't eat dinner tonight.
The chef made squid.

699
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,300
<i>- Yeah, I was just talking to my dad.
- Oh, really?</i>

700
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,600
Yeah, he wants Mr. Kilroy
to take over for me.

701
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,700
- That's not good. Is that what he said?
- Yeah.

702
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,100
- Oh.
- And the fact that he regrets
having had intercourse...

703
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
with my mother one particular night
many years ago.

704
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,400
[ Chuckling ]
Sorry to hear that.

705
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
So how are you guys doing?
You all right?

706
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm sorry. We're doing everything
we can to get you out of here.

707
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,300
- Thanks. Thank you.
- The nicest people, you know?

708
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,600
[ Together]
A lot of red tape.

709
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,500
Actually, um, I've had the opportunity
to do a lot of soul searching.

710
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,500
- Good.
- Yeah, it is good.

711
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,400
I've made a really big decision.
I've decided not to marry Donald.

712
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
- You're kidding.
- Yeah. Do you believe it?

713
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,200
- How come?
- [ Sighing ]

714
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,200
I don't know. I mean,
it's not that I don't like him.

715
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,700
He's a great guy.
He's really brilliant.

716
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,100
- A doctor. Yeah.
- He's gonna make a name
for himself someday...

717
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,900
in the area of hair transplants.

718
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,500
It's fine for him, I just--
I don't know if it's for me.

719
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,200
- You don't need any.
- [ Laughing ]

720
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Seems like a hasty decision.

721
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,800
Well, I don't know.
You think?

722
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,100
I figure if I'm not 1 00% sure--

723
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,700
- This is the rest of my life
we're talking about, you know?
- That's true.

724
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,700
Yeah.
So I've already told Donald...

725
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,600
and now I just have to
tell my parents.

726
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,500
- You phoned him?
- Yeah, I phoned him, and I told him.

727
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
- Wow.
- Yeah.

728
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,800
Must have been crushed.

729
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
I don't know. I'm not sure he wasn't
secretly relieved, you know?

730
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,800
- I can't believe that.
- It's my father...

731
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,000
who's gonna have a heart attack
or a stroke when he finds out.

732
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,400
- Something.
- He like Donald?

733
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,600
Well, compared to the other guys
I've gone out with--

734
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,600
I mean, Donald-- He is.
He's the answer to a father's prayer.

735
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,500
- How many guys have you gone out with?
- Oh,just a few.

736
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,900
You know. My father never really
appreciated my taste in men, you know?

737
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,100
The draft dodger, um--

738
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I went out with a Buddhist
ex-convict. He didn't like that.

739
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,600
There was a manic-depressive
jazz musician. My mother loved him.

740
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,200
But it's just my father.
He's hard to please.

741
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,200
- He must really hate the suburbs.
- Yes and no.

742
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,800
You know, um, a fortune-teller...

743
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,300
actually once told me
that I'd meet the man...

744
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
that I was gonna marry
under special circumstances.

745
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,500
She just said that, and I said ''What's
this special circumstance gonna be?''

746
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,100
And... then at Trader Vic's...

747
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,100
when Donald pulled the shrimp
out of my throat...

748
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,200
I figured this is special,
so I thought it might be him.

749
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,800
You know? And,
I don't know, call me crazy.

750
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,100
Now I have this feeling
it might be you.

751
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,900
This from a person
who listens to fortune-tellers.

752
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,500
- Well-- Me?
- You.

753
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,200
Well, these are special circumstances.

754
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Actually, the way I see it,
it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

755
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,800
Less, if you're lucky.

756
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,400
I mean, you know,
the corniest movie writer...

757
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,400
would never think of having two people
meet... in an embassy like this.

758
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,000
- I never really thought
about getting married.
- Here we are.

759
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I don't know if I'd
be that good at it.

760
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Well, uh, do you believe
in fortune-tellers?

761
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,500
I don't think so. 'Cause I saw
this one at a carnival once...

762
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,800
and she told me I was gonna
be the next Michelangelo.

763
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,600
''The next Michelangelo.''

764
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,100
Didn't happen.

765
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
Well, you're still young.
Maybe my fortune came true.

766
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,400
<i>I'm goin'stir crazy.
I gotta get outta here, Marion.</i>

767
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,400
<i>Relax, Walter.</i>

768
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,000
I wanna go to the country.

769
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,600
I wanna take a walk and see
the trees and smell the flowers.

770
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,400
<i>- You hate the country.
- I can't stand it.</i>

771
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,600
I miss the theater and the ballet.

772
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,000
<i>We haven't gone to the theater
or ballet in 20 years.</i>

773
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,400
That's not the point. I can't see
any baseball. I can't get an egg roll.

774
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
You know I'm lost
without my urologist.

775
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>Calm yourself.
Do some more situps or something.</i>

776
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,300
I can't. I'm seeing spots
in front of my eyes.

777
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,600
<i>- That's 'cause we played dominoes.
- I'm sick of dominoes.</i>

778
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,400
Last night I dreamt that I was
running down Times Square...

779
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
completely naked, stark naked.

780
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,000
<i>- I was cool and free.
- Yeah? What happened?</i>

781
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,900
What do you mean, ''what happened''?
They arrested me.

782
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,200
They took me away,
put me in an institution.

783
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,200
<i>Well, sure.
Who tells you to run naked?</i>

784

You want her to stay here
for the rest of her life?

1252
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,000
Yes, I'd rather she grew up here
than grow up an orphan.

1253
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,000
I can tolerate anybody's orphans
but my own, okay?

1254
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,300
- Walter, come here.
Listen to me for a minute.
- I got a headache.

1255
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,400
I got indigestion.
I want to play dominoes.

1256
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,100
Do you want your daughter
to see Donald again?

1257
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,800
Or at least meet some other
eligible men? Don't you want that?

1258
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,400
Tell me the plan.Just for fun.
Not that I'm interested...

1259
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,500
but I want to know
what he's thinking.

1260
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,300
- The night after tomorrow, we're
going to have a reception here.
- Who's catering?

1261
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,300
- Stop it!
- Would you let him finish?

1262
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,900
It's a big party in honor of the emir.
Several hundred guests.

1263
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,900
Dignitaries, men and women from
many nations, including this country.

1264
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,100
Now, you two and Susan, get dressed.
You wait in your room.

1265
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,500
- Right.
- Around midnight, when first
group of guests start to leave...

1266
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,800
you come down, you put on your coats,
you got out with them.

1267
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:56,000
-Just like that.
- Oh! It'll give you a chance
to wear your dark blue mohair.

1268
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,400
I don't like my dark blue mohair.
My mohair itches.

1269
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,100
How can mohair itch?
It's a very soft fabric.

1270
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,900
- Sue me, it itches.
I don't like the mohair.
- You're gonna have to wear...

1271
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
a dark suit, because I'm not
gonna escape unless you dress.

1272
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,400
I'm not dressing!
We're not going anyplace.

1273
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,900
The moment you go outside,
the embassy limousine will be waiting.

1274
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,900
- You get in and you're off!.
- It's simple.

1275
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,800
- What if it works? Then where do we go?
- The rest is very simple.

1276
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,900
My contacts are ready to see to it that
you'll be on your way home within hours.

1277
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,700
Mr. Hollander, I implore you,
for the safety... of everyone involved.

1278
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,600
We cannot procrastinate.
Timing is very important.

1279
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,200
Walter, we'll get to see Seth again.
I miss him so much!

1280
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:36,200
By the way, Walter, I didn't mention
this because I knew you'd get upset.

1281
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:40,300
- I got a letter from my brother.
Our apartment was robbed.
- What?

1282
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,700
Yes, burglars broke in.

1283
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,000
They stole the portable TV
and all your custom-made shirts.

1284
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,800
Oy, I'm a cursed caterer.
I-I'm running around here in Europe...

1285
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,300
and in New York there's robbers
with my initials on their shirt.

1286
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,300
- Evidently.
- [ Sighs ] Oy.

1287
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,700
Can we, uh, start planning this?

1288
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Hello. Montague?
This is Capulet.

1289
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,800
Mmm.

1290
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,500
The man with the blue scarf
is in Vienna.

1291
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,500
That's right.

1292
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,600
The tulips are in full bloom.

1293
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:19,700
Spring will be a little late this year.

1294
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,500
And that's why the lady is a tramp.

01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,300
I and my wife
have been invited.

1299

Naturally, you will
introduce her as ''Anna.''

1305
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,800
Understood. Understood.

1306
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:06,100
There's something--

1307
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,400
There's something
going on there.

1308
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,600
This ambassador's son,
the young Magee.

1309
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,300
He's either a genius...

1310
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,300
or an idiot.

1311
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,400
Look, tonight's the night.

1312
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,200
I'd just feel better if we
go over the whole thing again.

1313
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,600
It's a rotten plan, it won't work.
Let's call it off.

1314
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,300
- We're not calling anything off.

Who am I?
Who am I. I'm-I'm--

1316
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,000
I'm John Randall. I work for
the Department of the Interior.

1317
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'm married,
I have four children.

1318
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,100
I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
I went to school in California.

1319
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,300
I first came to government
under Roosevelt.

1320
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,600
I majored in agriculture.
I drive a Chrysler Imperial, I--

1321
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,200
- Who's gonna ask me this?
- In the event that they stop you
and ask you some questions...

1322
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,200

1324

John, Sam. I got such a headache
from this.

- What are you doing in Europe?
- What am I doing in Europe?

1326
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,000
Ask her. I'm in Europe to...

1327
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
help underdeveloped nations with
soil conservation and erosion problems.

1328
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,900
- Very good.
- Don't ''very good'' me. Okay?

And I'm his lovely wife Carmen.

1330
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,300
I was also the former
Miss Wisconsin of 1 941 .

If they believe that,
we win the whole Cold War.

One look at those varicose veins,
they'll think we're smuggling road maps.

Where are you staying in town?

1334
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,500
The Grand Hotel for one week.
Then we're flying to Malaysia.

1335
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,500
Okay, now, uh, uh-- What happens
when you leave the embassy?

1336
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,500
About midnight, when some of
the other guests are leaving...

1337
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,300
we casually say, ''Excuse me,''
and we leave with the largest group.

1338
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,400
Our chauffeur then drives us directly
to the lobby of the Grand Hotel.

1339
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,100
That's if we're not stopped, arrested,
beaten, tortured and thrown in jail.

1340
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,500
At the Grand Hotel, we switch cars.

1341
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,200
A man will come up to me and say,
''Those are extremely lovely earrings.

1342
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,200
My wife has a pair just like them.''

1343
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,800
- He will be our driver. We go with him.
- [ Axel ] Correct.

1344
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,800
And if a stranger happens
to admire her earrings...

1345
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,800
we'll wind up following him
to Lapland.

1346
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,100
What happens when he takes you
to the train station?

1347
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,800
What happens? Uh, someone
comes up to me, a man--

1348
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,900
presumably not suspicious--

1349
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,000
and he whispers in my ear,
''The grass is green.''

1350
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,100
For my money, Marion, he may as well
have a neon sign that says, ''I am a spy.''

1351
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,400
- Okay, and then what do you do?
- What do we do?

1352
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,000
We get on a train with him
going to Istanbul.

1353
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,000
Another first in my life.
I need Istanbul like the plague.

1354
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,500
- With my fear ofTurks.
- You're not going to get to Istanbul.

1355
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
Halfway there,
we jump off the train.

1356
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
I'm really
looking forward to that.

1357
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,500
I haven't jumped off
a moving train in months.

so worried about?
- Yeah.

<i>We'll see how you jump off
a moving train.</i>

She breaks her neck trying
to find a seat in a movie house.

1362
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,200
After leaving the train, we're met
by a man driving a wagon load of hay.

1363
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,800
- Right, correct.
- Then we dress up as peasants.

1364
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,400
We get onto the wagon
and we go with him.

1365
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,300
I got the worst hay fever in America,
he gets us on a hay wagon.

1366
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,600
He takes us to the seashore,
where we're picked up by a submarine.

1367
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,700
- Isn't it thrilling?
- Sub-- Yesterday it was an airplane!

1368
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,000
We had to change that.
There were some security precautions.

1369

I'm glad you told me. I'd have spent
the whole day looking for wings.

Now. Uh, oh!
You're gonna need this.

1371
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You're gonna need
some local currency.

1372
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,200
Oh, forget it.
Forget it. I got money.

- You know, go ahead. I'll get the next--

1374
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,800
We only have traveler's checks.
Take the money.

1375
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,800
They're good anywhere, Marion.

1376
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,400
You're gonna stop in a chase through an
alley and start signing traveler's checks?

1377

Since when are there gonna be chases?
You said this was gonna be simple.

I can't chase.

Take the money.

And, uh, one other thing.

1382
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,900
Do you know how
to fire one of these, a pistol?

1383
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,300

business is there a gunfight?

you just squeeze the trigger.

- I don't know how to use a gun?
- When did you use a gun?

- I don't know how to use a gun?
- When?

1392
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,500

Plenty of times.

<i>- ...tie it together again.
- He's a priest. Magic is
not his full-time job.</i>

1557
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,200
- I have to go. I'm sorry.
- But he said he was
gonna put it together.

1558
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:03,100
- Well, Mr. Magee, thank you so much.
- Very nice party.

1559
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,200
- Thank you very much.
- A lovely, lovely evening.

1560
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,300
- Very, very nice party. Here.
- Yes, we'll be going.

1561
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,400
- Oh, yes. Nice to have chatted with you.
- Come on, Carmen.

1562
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,100
Hope to see you soon.
Yes,John, yes. Good-bye.

1563
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,100
<i>[ Axel ]
Yes, well, um--</i>

1564
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,300
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to have met you.

1565
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,600
And maybe, maybe I'll see you
in Newark sometime.

1566
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1567
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,900
''Orville, do you think they'll give us
a parade up Fifth Avenue?''

1568
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,700
''I don't doubt it.'' ''Mother would love
that.'' ''She would, wouldn't she?''

1569
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,200
<i>- [ Gunshot ]
- Oh, my God!</i>

1570
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,500
What happened? Oh, my goodness,

[ All Talking Together]

1573
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:56,100
Stay calm! That's right.
Oh, my God!

1574
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,400
Tell me what the hell happened?

1575
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,300
- Who shot me?
- Whoa.

1576
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,300
Dad.

1577
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,600
<i>No, I will not hear of it.</i>

1578
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,500
<i>Send the embassy limousines.
We leave immediately.</i>

1579
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,600
His Majesty will not
stay an extra minute.

1580
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,900
<i>- But, sir, I--
- No, now, now! This instant!</i>

1581
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,400
- Oscar has prepared a wonderful brunch.
- No. Brunch?

1582
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,400
- I am not going to stay here for brunch.
- Let me get the ambassador.

1583
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,800
How could you do that?
How could you attempt an escape?

1584
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:32,000
Dad, the situation called
for something bold, you know?

1585
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,100
- If it had worked--
- But it failed!

1586
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,100
Like everything else you do, it failed!

1587
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,100
I mean, riots, bombs, pickets,
that's never happened in my embassy.

1588
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,100
And this morning
a devout priest produced...

1589
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,600
a seven of spades behind my left ear.

1590
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,600
<i>- He's been working on that.
He was having a hard time--

- Come in!
- ''The flight went well.''

1592
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,300
<i>- Flight?
- ''Yes, it did, Orville.
I was surprised.''</i>

1593
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,300
[ Chuckles ]
''Me too, Wilbur.''

1594
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,900
''Well, I shouldn't say
surprised, but encouraged.''

1595
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,400
''Me too.'' ''Now, you mark my words,
we'll show the world.''

1596
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:08,100
I'll get you for this, Axel.
I promise you, I will get you for this.

1597
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,300
<i>The emir's leaving.
I think the situation is irreparable.</i>

1598
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:16,500
<i>I'll speak to him. By the way,
your mother called.</i>

1599
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,400
She wants you to mail her
your birth certificate.

1600
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,100
- Come on, boys.
- Huh? Oh. ''Have you met my brother?''

1601
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,400
''Oh, hello.
You look very well.''

1602
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,000
''Thank you, I feel well.''

1603
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:34,000
Well, you wondered what happens,
you go along with a lunatic.

1604
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I told you the gun was dangerous.

1605
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Again, she's still on the gun.

1606
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,500
You shot two people in the last
2 4 hours! How many do you need?

1607
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,300
Marion, how am I gonna know
there was the ambassador?

1608
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:50,000
- You want him to wear a little sign?
- The gun went off by itself!.

1609
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,200
I didn't shoot the gun. It must have
been one of those new guns.

1610
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,900
They buy 'em by the bushel from Taiwan.
[ Muttering ]

1611
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,100
Axel, I'm sorry. This was all our fault.
Right, Dad?

1612
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,200
If it was anybody's fault,
it was my fault.

1613
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,200
And now they've doubled
the guards outside.

1614
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,500
It was a nice try, Magee.
Unfortunately, I shot the boss.

1615
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,600
But you know,
you can't have everything.

1616
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:13,000
I better call Barney Silverman.
He's probably still at Montauk Point...

1617
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,200
with the station wagon,
waiting for us to surface.

1618
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,000
- What is this? What are you doing?
-Just doing a little laundry.

1619
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,300
Mr. Burns says
the emir is packing.

1620
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,100
- She's doing laundry.
- She does Kilroy, she does Burns...

1621
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,200
she dusts, she waxes, and now
she's doing the bedouins.

1622
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,200
[ Scoffs ]
Just two of his wives.

1623
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,200
They're lovely young women.
I'll give it to them.

1624
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:36,500
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

1625
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,800
<i>- I got an idea.
- [ Walter ]
I heard that. He's got an idea.</i>

1626
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:41,100
- I'll be in the fallout shelter.
- How many do you have?

1627
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,300
-Just two.
- Okay.

1628
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,500
- What are you thinking?
- Father Drobney, come down here.

1629
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,500
What's going through your mind, Magee,
besides the usual cattle stampede?

1630
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,000
Stand right there. Yeah, it'll fit.

1631
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,600
- Wait, this could work. Do you see?
- We gotta hurry, though.

1632
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,800
- They're gonna leave any minute.
- What are we discussing?

1633
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,500
- You know I'm a size ten.
- Yeah. Okay, you two.

1634
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,500
- Change. Quickly.
- Change what?

1635
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,200
- I don't get it.
- We leave with the emir's harem!

1636
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,200
What's wrong with you?

1637
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,400
- A harem?
- Yes.

1638
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,300
- The two of us--
- Yeah, because with the veils,
wh-who'll notice?

1639
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,400
He has 1 4, now he's got two more.

1640
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,500
You're telling me the man
doesn't count his harem?

1641
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,700
- Who doesn't count the harem?
- This is a brilliant plan!
This could work.

1642
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,700
- No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not dressing as an Arab.
- No, no, you are.

1643
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,700
And then you get into
the embassy limousine, it takes
you to the transfer point...

1644
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,900
and you meet
Drobney's contacts!

1645
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,800
- Instantly he can see
there's two more wives.
- Maybe he will, maybe he won't.

1646
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,000
- It's worth a shot.
- Don't tell me maybe.
I don't want to know maybe.

1647
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,300
Forget it. Let him spend the money
on a lobotomy.

1648
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,600
- We're wasting time here.
- What about Susan?
We only have two outfits.

1649
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,300
I got that figured out too.

1650
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,200
- You two,just dress, okay?
- All right. Let's go.

1651
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:50,100
- Walter, here.
- I'm not dressing, Marion.
Leave me alone.

1652
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,700
I don't want to wind up in a harem.
We'll spend the rest of our lives...

1653
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:55,000
on satin pillows
in the Persian Gulf.

1654
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:58,500
- Quickly. Would you change?
- No, I don't want to.

1655
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,800
Marion, is that what you want?
To be a love slave?

1656
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,000
You're at least a man. I'm the one that's
gonna have to learn those wiggly dances.

1657
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,200
<i>- Let's go.!
- How did you think of this?</i>

1658
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,500
- I never would have
thought of this plan.
- Ah--

1659
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,100
So sorry. Cold compresses.
Wives. Clear. Coming through.

1660
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:14,200
Mr. Magee. You called?

1661
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:17,000
- Father Drobney. Are your contacts
still ready to go?
- Yes.

1662
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,000
- Good. Alert them immediately.
- Absolutely.

1663
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:23,100
- All systems go.
- You're transforming
before my eyes. It's wonderful.

1664
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,100
Susan, every once in a while
fate comes along...

1665
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,400
takes a man by the hand and
allows him to move mountains.

1666
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,700
- Isn't it faith? I think it's faith.
- Is it... faith?

1667
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,700
I always thought it was fate.
Maybe that's why it never made sense.

1668
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,200
- I'm so proud of you.
- Before you walked into my life...

1669
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,700
- I was nothing, I was a loser--
- I didn't walk into your life.

1670
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:43,500
- I ran.
- But now, I have this feeling
I could do anything!

1671
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,800
I have this confidence,
this sense of optimism.

1672
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:49,500
Maybe you're really
a manic-depressive.

1673
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,500
- No, I'm in love.
- You're in love. [ Chuckles ]

1674
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,900
I'm in love, for the first time
since Elsie Holmquist.

1675
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
- Who's Elsie Holmquist?
You never mentioned her.
- This Swedish girl.

1676
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,300
I met her in an embassy.
Boy, could she ski.

1677
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,300
- That's how I broke my pelvis.
- Oh.

1678
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:06,000
- Susan, you've become my whole world.
- You've become mine.

1679
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,400
I am so happy, I could sing!

1680
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,900
Do I have to listen to this?

1681
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,900
- Ha! Okay.
- See you in a minute.

1682
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,300
The storm we were expecting
will be a little late.

1683
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,000
The boy with the blue hair...

1684
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,700

01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:46,100
I'm telling you a million times.
My doctor told me I have
the thighs of a princess.

- So you wearing a princess's clothes.
- It itches!

- It's silk.
- Everything is ready.

1695
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,700
Go immediately and God bless you.

1696

Just stay calm, cool, collected,

just mutter something about Allah.

1698
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,000
- Uh-huh.
- The limousine driver will
take you to the Grand Hotel.

From there on, our plans
are precisely the same.

1700

- What about Susan? We didn't decide.
- In a little while...

1701

Susan and I are gonna walk out of here
under full diplomatic immunity.

1702
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,400
- How are we gonna do that?
- Well, as the wife
of a foreign diplomat...

1703
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,400
you'd be entitled to that.

1704

- Wife? You-You and her?
- It's perfect.

- If you'll have me.
- Oh, Axel!

1708
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,300
My Susan! A bride!

1709
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:34,700
This is the happiest day of my life!

1710
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,200
I only wish your father
were alive to see this!

1711
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,300
- I am alive. I'm standing right here.
- Oh, yeah.

1712
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,500
- I'm sorry! I got carried away.
- 'Cause I'm wearing this.

1713
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:48,000
- You look like you
should be named Fatima.
- This is a brilliant plan.

1714
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,600
- You're gonna marry her?
She's gonna marry--
- Yes!

1715
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,400
- You want him to?
- I do, yes! I love you.

1716
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,500
- Oh. Oh! Oh.
- [ Ululating ]

1717
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,500
Walter. Walter. Stop that.
We have to go.

1718
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,800
- [ Continues Ululating ]
- Walter. Walter, control yourself.

1719
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,800
- Mr. Hollander--
- Stop! Stop!

1720
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,800
- [ Continues ]
- All right. Shh! Walter.

1721
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,300
Listen, Susan. Darling.

1722
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,800
When we're on the submarine,
you'll wire me your silverware pattern.

1723
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,800
- Absolutely. As soon as I know.
- [ Axel ] Good luck.

1724
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:17,800
- You stepped on my Hush Puppies!
- Oh, sorry.

1725
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:22,800
Walter, take it easy.
Let's go. [ Indistinct ]

1726
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,100
- Now, now!
- [ Ululating ]

1727
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,200
- But they're marrying!
- Yes! [ Ululating ]

1728
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,700
[ Drobney ] God keep them.
I'm so happy for you both.

1729
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,200
- Thank you.
- I'm happy. Are you happy?

1730
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:38,300
- Yeah!
- I'm happy.

1731
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,300
- You look so great.
- [ Chuckles ]

1732
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,700
Father, I didn't speak out of turn.
You can do a ceremony, right?

1733
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,700
- Yes, I could do. Yes.
Six years I haven't.
- Is he a rabbi?

1734
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,700
- Do we need a rabbi?
- Hour and a half--

1735
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:51,200
<i>- Do you know any rabbis
in the underground?
-Just have to change my clothes.</i>

1736
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,900
Come. Come, let's go. Soon
we will be home at the palace...

1737
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,500
and I expect every one of you
to go out of your way...

1738
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,200
to see that His Majesty forgets
this unpleasant occurrence.

1739
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:09,600
I'm sure you know
what I mean, hmm?

1740
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:13,100
- Hey, why is he staring at me?
- You look sexy in those clothes.

1741
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,200
I don't like this, Marion.
I don't like this.

1742
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,800
[ Softly ]
Well, you look fine.

1743
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,800
[ Low Chattering ]

1744
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,700
<i>[ Narrator ] That morning, the Hollanders
left the United States embassy...</i>

1745
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,800
<i>with a boldness and courage
unknown to them before.</i>

1746
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,800
<i>Indeed, the plan devised by Axel Magee
was a brilliant one.</i>

1747
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,200
<i>The following day, they
were married by Father Drobney.</i>

1748
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:43,000
Therefore, I pronounce you
man and wife.

1749
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,100
[ Laughing ]
Congratulations!

1750
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,300
[ Muttering ]

1751
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:54,100
Look. Hey! Oh, it's a joke.
[ Chuckling ]

1752
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,900
<i>[ Narrator ] Within 24 hours,
the Hollanders were safely
en route to the United States.</i>

1753
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,700
<i>Axel Magee quit
the Foreign Service...</i>

1754
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,100
<i>and went to work
for his father-in-law...</i>

1755
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,400
<i>who was overwhelmed with
the young man's natural gifts...</i>

1756
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,500
<i>for sculpting the bride and groom
out of chopped liver.</i>

1757
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:15,200
<i>At last, the fortune-teller's prediction
about Magee as a new Michelangelo...</i>

1758
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,300
<i>had proved true.</i>
