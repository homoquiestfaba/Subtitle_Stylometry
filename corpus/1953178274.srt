00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:48,916
<i>Under a tyranny,</i>
<i>most friends are a liability.</i>

2
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:52,621
<i>One quarter of them turn reasonable</i>
<i>and become your enemies.</i>

3
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:55,596
<i>One quarter are afraid</i>
<i>to stop and speak.</i>

4
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,259
<i>And one quarter are killed,</i>
<i>and you die with them.</i>

5
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:02,369
<i>The blessed final quarter</i>
<i>keep you alive.</i>

6
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:05,601
<i>Sinclair Lewis said that...</i>

7
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:08,644
<i>...a long time before</i>
<i>the new millennium.</i>

8
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:11,339
<i>A long time before</i>
<i>everything changed.</i>

9
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:27,982
Escaped positive.

10
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:42,561
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven....</i>

11
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,686
<i>Raise your right hand</i>
<i>and repeat after me.</i>

12
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,620
<i>-I do solemnly swear.</i>
<i>-I do solemnly swear.</i>

13
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:11,456
<i>That I will faithfully execute the office</i>
<i>of president of the United States.</i>

14
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,031
<i>That I will faithfully execute the office</i>
<i>of president of the United States.</i>

15
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,193
<i>-And will, to the best of my ability.</i>
<i>-And will, to the best of my ability.</i>

16
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:22,871
<i>Preserve, protect, and defend</i>
<i>the Constitution of the United States.</i>

17
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,841
<i>Preserve, protect, and defend</i>
<i>the Constitution of the United States.</i>

18
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:28,741
<i>So help me, God.</i>

19
00:04:28,914 --> 00:04:30,176
<i>So help me, God.</i>

20
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:32,541
<i>Congratulations.</i>

21
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,650
<i>Mr. Chief Justice, my fellow citizens.</i>

22
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:42,760
<i>Four years ago when I stood before you</i>
<i>on these hallowed steps...</i>

23
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,624
<i>...we faced together</i>
<i>the awesome task...</i>

24
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:50,359
<i>...of healing the sick and weary soul</i>
<i>of our great nation.</i>

25
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:53,834
<i>Don't think a day has passed</i>
<i>since then, that I haven't prayed...</i>

26
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,174
<i>...in thanks for the unity</i>
<i>we have found in that battle.</i>

27
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,810
<i>Together, we have won back our country</i>
<i>from the talkers and the promise-makers.</i>

28
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,950
<i>-We have put the darkness behind us.</i>
-Is there a problem?

29
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:08,108
<i>The curfews, the econo--</i>

30
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,421
Didn't I tell you
to keep off the streets?

31
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,454
Did you?

32
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:16,720
<i>Together, we have seen the dawning of</i>
<i>not just a new millennium, but a new--</i>

33
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:23,457
There's kids around here, man.
You gotta think about that.

34
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,732
Clean this up.

35
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,999
<i>Most courageously of all...</i>

36
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:32,574
<i>...we have risen at last to the challenge</i>
<i>of this terrible disease.</i>

37
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:34,871
<i>Never again will the whiners</i>
<i>and the crybabies...</i>

38
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,447
<i>...tell us we can't protect ourselves</i>
<i>and our children.</i>

39
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,745
<i>Yet, but now,</i>
<i>we must ask the Lord to tell us...</i>

40
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,186
<i>...what sin and what sinners...</i>

41
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,289
<i>...we have yet to cast out</i>
<i>of our midst.</i>

42
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,060
<i>We must ask for his help</i>
<i>in returning...</i>

43
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:54,892
<i>...to the great moral principles</i>
<i>this country was built on.</i>

44
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,537
<i>To the wellspring of our freedoms</i>
<i>and our tradition in this....</i>

45
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,932
I think I got it, Blue.

46
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,597
<i>-We must ask him to put in our heart...</i>
-Got what?

47
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,141
<i>...a greater understanding...</i>

48
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:10,179
<i>...of why he has stricken us</i>
<i>with this mortal plague.</i>

49
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:11,372
<i>Most important....</i>

50
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:13,574
You are such a drama queen,
it's unbelievable.

51
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,617
You don't know anything.

52
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:19,918
-Laurie, how?
-You know that dance we went to?

53
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:23,026
The guy with the red hair?

54
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:25,758
<i>-More than anything, I'm proud...</i>
-Hi.

55
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:29,731
<i>...of the spirit of decency that is</i>
<i>growing every day among our youth.</i>

56
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:34,736
<i>And to all you find young men out there</i>
<i>in the home guard, I just want to say:</i>

57
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,703
<i>Thanks.</i>

58
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,450
Will someone please give me a break?

59
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:50,554
Hey, Bucky, you wanna shut
your sister up for a minute?

60
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,252
-Blue.
-Bucky.

61
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,790
It's your night for dinner.

62
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:58,121
<i>In honor of the inauguration,</i>
<i>all Workfare Occupation centers...</i>

63
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,196
<i>...will be closing one half-hour early.</i>

64
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:04,528
I'm going to get tested. I'm gonna go to that
Operation Helping Hand place right now.

65
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,639
What's the hurry? It's two weeks
to quarterlies. Less. Hello?

66
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:11,605
You think I could sleep one minute
till I found out?

67
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,471
Excuse me, could we get some help?

68
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:17,114
What? What? Find out what? That you
got a terminal case of hypochondria?

69
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,373
Kilo and a half.

70
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,677
These sores I keep getting
are not hypochondria.

71
00:07:20,852 --> 00:07:23,116
Neither is the way
I'm always tired all the time.

72
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:25,813
One point eight, 3.5.

73
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,926
Hey, there's my bus.

74
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:31,824
-I'll send you a postcard from quarantine.
-Laurie.

75
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,122
Can't believe you would take
such a chance.

76
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:37,993
I had to, Blue.
There was a connection between us.

77
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:40,763
Did you call him?
Find out if he was sick?

78
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,735
Oh, man, Laurie.

79
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,606
All right, all right,
so I didn't get his name.

80
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:52,007
He was just this guy, you know?

81
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:58,318
Anyway, who knows if it was even him?
I could've got breathed on, on the street.

82
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:03,824
Anyway, you're not always so careful,
are you?

83
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:07,829
Kind of hasn't been much
of an issue lately, has it?

84
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,830
You think that's better?

85
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:21,769
God.

86
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:27,745
No big deal, right?
We're gonna get through this.

87
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,357
Hi.

88
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,438
Just get rid of it.

89
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,371
Name, address, certificate number.

90
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,981
After you have been called
into the examination room...

91
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,519
...you will be requested to remain there
until the results have been determined.

92
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,481
Blue.

93
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,756
Come on.

94
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,590
I would die if you weren't here
with me, Blue.

95
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,291
-I would really just die.
-You'll be all right.

96
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,404
Nothing like a little good news,
is there?

97
00:09:20,705 --> 00:09:24,368
You'll be receiving a registered copy
of your certificate in the next day or so.

98
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,874
-Bye-bye.
-Doctor?

99
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:30,446
I'm sorry to bother you again,
but I've been waiting for my grandson....

100
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,947
-Can I have a magazine?
-Mrs. Chaney, I'm sorry...

101
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:35,552
...but you will know
something as soon as we do.

102
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,620
Please, doctor.
Can't you tell me when I--?

103
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,757
Keep that thing out of sight.

104
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:57,637
Mrs. Chaney.

105
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:00,507
Where's Tommy?

106
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:03,647
-If you could step up to my office--
-I'm not stepping nowhere...

107
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:04,975
...until I see my boy.

108
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:09,382
I'm afraid that's not possible
right now, Mrs. Chaney.

109
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,686
He's sick.

110
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,849
He's sick. He's dying.

111
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:20,123
Mrs. Chaney, please. Please, calm down.
Please, please.

112
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:23,595
Your grandson will be receiving
the best care he possibly can.

113
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:25,963
-This is a question of public safety.
-Tommy!

114
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:30,073
This is a medical facility. I cannot
allow you to create a disturbance.

115
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:33,574
We're gonna get out of here right now
before they come back.

116
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:37,937
We can't just go. They have my name.

117
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:40,050
Shit.

118
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:45,979
I figured as long as I was here,
I might as well get it done too.

119
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:48,853
-Name, address, certificate-- Okay.
-Yeah, I know.

120
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:53,522
What are you doing with that? Security.

121
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:55,494
Security.

122
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,197
Hey, watch it.

123
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,701
<i>Burner, what's your 20?</i>

124
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,074
Move it. They're heading west.

125
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:13,844
Hey! Come on!

126
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:18,182
-This way. Come on.
-Come on.

127
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:24,219
Come on. Get in.

128
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:32,129
What the hell is this?

129
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:36,032
There's cops after them, Torch.
They were running out of the center.

130
00:11:36,374 --> 00:11:37,568
You're a good man, Willie.

131
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:40,369
A lot better than you should be.
Clear them out of here.

132
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,513
Come on, Torch.
They're gonna get nailed.

133
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,114
-We gotta hide them.
-Get it open.

134
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:47,284
I can't. It's jammed.

135
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,751
Come on. Get back.

136
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:15,712
-What are they gonna do to us?
-Shut up.

137
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:43,974
There's a staircase up here.

138
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,977
Officers, officers, wait, please.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

139
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:54,744
There were two girls with guns.
They went that way, right that way.

140
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,854
Hey, did they rob a bank
or something?

141
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:04,495
-Come on. Come on.
-I can't believe that worked.

142
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,596
Wait, wait, wait.
You never saw this place.

143
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:08,061
You never met me.

144
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,166
You hear me? This never happened.

145
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,267
Okay.

146
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:27,044
I saw that.

147
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,116
You telling me you weren't scared
you'd get it?

148
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,484
I'm telling you
she was behind the fence.

149
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:38,787
Yeah. And her guts were spilling out
and her blood was flying around.

150
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:42,432
Somebody's gotta clean up the trash.
Too bad you missed it, Bucky.

151
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,933
You gotta do more night patrols with
us, man. Anyway, enough about that.

152
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:48,937
I want you to follow up on that Chink
over at that Laundromat.

153
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,099
That guy shows up late for his
quarterlies, I'm gonna put him on report.

154
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,938
Now, Payne, you still keeping an eye
on that Burack character?

155
00:13:57,115 --> 00:13:59,083
Kind of.
You know, my guess is, he's clean.

156
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:01,944
He hasn't been around
that weird bookstore much.

157
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,880
Yeah. I don't buy it.
Stay on him for a while.

158
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,686
Yeah, you got it.

159
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,055
Bucky, you're up.

160
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:14,331
Now, did Rocklyn or did Rocklyn not
start that strike bullshit...

161
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:15,864
...down at the impound place?

162
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,900
It's hard to tell anything about him.
Mostly he keeps to himself.

163
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:23,631
Except for this guy from the grocery
he goes to the movies with.

164
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:27,539
-Just the two of them?
-Yeah. At least, since I've been on this.

165
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:31,478
Doesn't surprise me a bit.
Guy's got faggot written all over him.

166
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:35,817
You think that's something
the police should get into?

167
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:38,182
Department of Health.
They're much faster.

168
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:39,788
Blue.

169
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,027
Why don't you hang out?
Why don't you stick around a little?

170
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:47,798
You know what you are, Hunter?
A walking advertisement for not fucking.

171
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,957
Government ought to put you
on a poster.

172
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:01,911
<i>Thank you....</i>

173
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:05,279
<i>We have a good time.</i>
<i>We have a good time.</i>

174
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,010
<i>All right, first of all.</i>
<i>Say hello over here....</i>

175
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,844
Mom?

176
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:11,921
Why do you have to be like that?

177
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,389
It makes me sick
just listening to you guys.

178
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,486
Mom.

179
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:21,564
-Mom.
-You got a problem, talk to the chef.

180
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:25,532
Mom, you're home from work now.
Do you wanna wash up or keep sleeping?

181
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:27,330
Sleep.

182
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,736
It's not just you guys, it's everything.

183
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,208
What does that mean?

184
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,543
Well, just-- Everything.
The way everything is.

185
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,651
What, you liked it better
when we were kids?

186
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:44,287
Everybody taking drugs,
people killing each other...

187
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,354
...nobody having any respect
for anything?

188
00:15:46,524 --> 00:15:50,517
I hate it when you talk like that. Like
you're trying to get an A from teacher.

189
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,658
<i>If I do anymore dancing...</i>

190
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:57,062
<i>...the vice president's</i>
<i>gonna have to clear his schedule.</i>

191
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:04,405
If anything's going to save us
from earning less than Mom...

192
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:09,205
...and sharing the same room
till we die...

193
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,314
...it's this.

194
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:14,879
Unless you think they're gonna be
giving out jobs for Christmas.

195
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,653
<i>In case you're wondering,</i>
<i>that 3-carat cabochon ruby...</i>

196
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:24,294
<i>...on the first lady's necklace</i>
<i>is on loan--</i>

197
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,622
Monkey Shines <i>will be back</i>
<i>after this message...</i>

198
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:32,531
<i>...from Operation Helping Hand,</i>
<i>making your hard choices a little easier.</i>

199
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:36,264
<i>And they all come</i>
<i>with a five-year guarantee.</i>

200
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,345
<i>I can get you a great deal</i>
<i>on some very nice land in Florida.</i>

201
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,975
<i>What are you so worried about?</i>

202
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,410
<i>I got protection.</i>

203
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:54,018
<i>Don't be fooled. The only way</i>
<i>to play it safe is not to play at all.</i>

204
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:58,655
<i>In response to the unprecedented</i>
<i>massing of troops on the 1 6th parallel...</i>

205
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:01,354
<i>...the president took time out</i>
<i>from tonight's revelry...</i>

206
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:04,968
<i>...to warn that the United States</i>
<i>will not hesitate to use any means...</i>

207
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:08,469
<i>...to ensure the security and the freedom</i>
<i>of its allies in the region.</i>

208
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:11,904
<i>Pentagon sources report</i>
<i>that all forces in the crisis zone....</i>

209
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:33,923
What am I doing?

210
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:49,278
Hey.

211
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:52,439
Hey, could you help me?

212
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:55,952
-What's the problem, ma'am?
-You're the problem.

213
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,611
-What are you doing?
-Just lending a helping hand.

214
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,781
I told you about coming back here.
Who else knows?

215
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,052
-Knows what?
-What's happening here.

216
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:06,661
-I wish I knew.
-Simon, move it.

217
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,822
The auto shop's set up.

218
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,127
Lennie, drive.

219
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,838
What are you doing?

220
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,871
Keeping you right where I can see you.

221
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:21,740
I'm not saying you're out of trouble yet.
At least you're with the good guys.

222
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,908
Welcome to the quarantine express.

223
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:35,952
All right, anybody here tattooed yet?
Because if you are, we cannot help you.

224
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:37,253
No.

225
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:42,563
Okay, pull out, Lennie.

226
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:45,993
Willie, we're moving.

227
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:49,466
Forty-five minutes,
they would have had you in quarantine.

228
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,868
You're safe now.

229
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,478
Forget about going home because
that's the first place they're gonna look.

230
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:57,011
-We just gotta get you out of here.
-And then what?

231
00:18:57,214 --> 00:19:01,048
-Not my department.
-We have safe houses.

232
00:19:01,252 --> 00:19:05,279
They're not the Hilton Hotel, but they're
better than where you were headed.

233
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:09,982
Be careful not to breathe too deep
around these guys.

234
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:13,460
-Can't you get it that way?
-Don't you read the government reports?

235
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:16,789
Perplexing mystery.
Nobody knows for sure.

236
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:18,457
Isn't that what they said?

237
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:23,269
The only way to get this disease
is straight into your bloodstream...

238
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:24,634
...one way or another.

239
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,937
I'm cold. I'm so cold.

240
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,679
Can I call my grandma?
I want her to know I'm all right.

241
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:34,578
No phone calls. We'll get a message
to her when it's safe.

242
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:41,453
<i>There's cops behind you, a block away.</i>

243
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,024
Lennie, move it.

244
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:48,925
You took the wrong fucking ramp,
Lennie.

245
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,900
-The wagons are on the other side.
-Well, what was he supposed to do?

246
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:06,474
We'll never get across that.
Please tell me this isn't happening.

247
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,050
<i>Don't even think</i>
<i>about going back down.</i>

248
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,984
That cop's still sniffing around.

249
00:20:19,964 --> 00:20:21,022
Pack up the van.

250
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:27,000
One hand right in front of the other.
That's right.

251
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:29,067
You're doing great.

252
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:34,467
Didn't know you had a date tonight.

253
00:20:35,613 --> 00:20:38,514
Wait over there. Over there.

254
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:40,946
There you go. Okay.

255
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:44,644
-All right, one hand in front of the other.
<i>-These cops keep hanging around.</i>

256
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:46,084
<i>I don't get it, man.</i>

257
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:49,226
<i>-You lost that other guy, I know you did.</i>
-Right across.

258
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:50,451
Lennie, pull out!

259
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:56,763
Don't move.

260
00:21:00,771 --> 00:21:03,501
<i>Come on, man. Come on, move it.</i>

261
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,714
-Get back.
-Don't be crazy.

262
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,682
Come on.

263
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,462
<i>We got trouble, man.</i>
<i>There's a cop coming down Pavonia.</i>

264
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:30,196
<i>He's headed straight for us, Torch.</i>

265
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:33,768
<i>They must have some kind</i>
<i>of tracking thing in the van.</i>

266
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:37,931
Don't listen to him.
Walk when I walk, okay?

267
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:46,743
Okay.

268
00:21:56,961 --> 00:21:58,861
Oh, my God.

269
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,858
-Oh, my God.
-Just get up very slowly.

270
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:09,238
No, I can't move.

271
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:13,665
Guess you'd rather stick around
and wait for the bomb to go off.

272
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:15,536
What bomb?

273
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:18,910
What did you think I was doing
back there, setting my alarm clock?

274
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:25,217
Don't look down. Look at me.

275
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:28,917
It's gonna break.
The ladder's gonna break.

276
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:31,922
-What's your name?
-What?

277
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:33,723
I asked you what your name was.

278
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:38,496
-Blue.
-Don't look down. Look at me.

279
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,603
Look in my eyes, Blue.

280
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:43,933
Don't look down. Look in my eyes.

281
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,309
Just get up very slowly.

282
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:57,777
You can trust me or you can die.

283
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,296
That's it. That's it. Okay.

284
00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:11,198
You're gonna be okay, Blue.
Ain't got nothing to worry about.

285
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:13,962
Me, I'm telling you...

286
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:18,298
...when I go, it ain't gonna be
from falling off no fucking ladder.

287
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,574
<i>Come on, you guys.</i>

288
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:34,621
Give me your hand. Come on!

289
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:37,551
Come on.

290
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:40,820
Give me your hand. Come on.

291
00:23:50,374 --> 00:23:52,535
Hands up! Now!

292
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:55,938
Call for backup.

293
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,508
Why bother?

294
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:01,276
-We have the authority for this?
-Are you gonna give me trouble?

295
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:03,420
I don't know about this, man.

296
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:05,646
All you need to know
is that we got orders.

297
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,520
Yes!

298
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:12,923
Okay. Okay, easy with this guy.

299
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,596
Okay, I got him.

300
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:34,115
Do you do this every night?

301
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,249
What are you doing?

302
00:24:40,424 --> 00:24:43,791
You'd better wear a blindfold
till we get where we're going.

303
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,592
I'm not putting this disgusting thing
on my face.

304
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,493
There are doctors where we're going.

305
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:54,535
Food. Beds. You don't put that on,
they don't get there.

306
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,188
Willie, sit them down over there.

307
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,593
Make it comfortable.

308
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,795
Help me get this guy
a wheelchair, okay?

309
00:25:41,585 --> 00:25:45,851
-Where are we?
-Someplace they don't know about yet.

310
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:53,829
-What happened to him?
-I don't know.

311
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:56,494
Okay, bring him over here.

312
00:25:57,768 --> 00:26:00,362
Bring him down real careful.

313
00:26:00,537 --> 00:26:02,903
Okay. Now,
you just hang in there, Stu.

314
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:05,198
We'll make you
as comfortable as you can be.

315
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:09,209
-You'll let my son know I'm all right?
-Just hold real steady.

316
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:12,907
You okay?

317
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,574
You'd think it would get a little easier
after a while.

318
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:18,220
You are really sick.
There's some medicine.

319
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:21,147
Stuff we smuggle in from New York.

320
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,552
-Lennie.
-Yeah.

321
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:24,921
Take her home now.

322
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:30,357
Where am I taking you?

323
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:33,035
1 4 West 90th Street.

324
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:00,663
Yeah, Hunter...

325
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:03,800
...she clocked in at 6:03.

326
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:10,096
I don't wanna hear about it.

327
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:11,969
Me either.

328
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:15,504
I wanna hear about this.

329
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:20,305
I don't get it.
Did Laurie get tested or didn't she?

330
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:23,544
-Why are you going through my things?
-Where did you get this from?

331
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,588
Stop the presses. I'm only gonna be
a half-hour late for work today.

332
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,518
Did you have a good run?

333
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:35,290
Mom's really impressed that
you've taken up early morning jogging.

334
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:38,628
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's great.
You know, it really gets the blood going.

335
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:42,795
I don't have blood anymore.
I just have coffee.

336
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,338
You should eat something, Mom.

337
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,808
Thanks.

338
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,406
What's going on, Blue?

339
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,747
Bucky...

340
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:59,321
...you know the stuff they keep
telling us about the quarantine?

341
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:02,356
How great it's supposed to be,
all clean and happy and wonderful?

342
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,084
-Yeah.
-It's all lies.

343
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:07,822
They lock these people up,
they don't give them medicine--

344
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:10,225
They won't let their families
visit them?

345
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,597
The quarantine has to be total.
It's too much of a risk.

346
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,705
Why can't they talk to anybody
on the telephone? Tell me that.

347
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:18,773
You tell me where you were last night.

348
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:23,577
Listen to this. You have to hear this.

349
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:26,272
<i>Authorities attribute the hijacking</i>
<i>of the ambulance...</i>

350
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,214
<i>...to an unnamed group</i>
<i>intent on causing panic in the city.</i>

351
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:32,219
<i>No suspects have been arrested,</i>
<i>intelligence sources confirm...</i>

352
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:36,120
<i>...that the terrorists plan to use</i>
<i>the contaminated blood as a weapon....</i>

353
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:39,387
You know, I never thought
I'd hear myself saying this...

354
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:42,760
...but I'm beginning to think...

355
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,668
...the only choice
they have is to kill these people.

356
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,270
Like they did when it was drugs.
I don't know what else they can do.

357
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,771
<i>--was applauded</i>
<i>by lawmakers in the state capital.</i>

358
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:54,604
<i>The Department of Health</i>
<i>asks citizens with information...</i>

359
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:58,339
<i>...regarding the activities of this group</i>
<i>to contact the home guard...</i>

360
00:28:58,548 --> 00:29:00,607
<i>...or call Operation Helping Hand.</i>

361
00:29:00,784 --> 00:29:02,308
<i>On the international scene....</i>

362
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:04,386
<i>I know you like her...</i>

363
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:07,352
...otherwise, you wouldn't bother
to be so mean to her.

364
00:29:07,524 --> 00:29:09,549
I remember you used to try
that with my mom...

365
00:29:09,726 --> 00:29:11,421
...when you were going out with her.

366
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:15,554
At least in those days,
you used to have a little privacy.

367
00:29:15,732 --> 00:29:19,759
Fine. I'll turn myself into the state.

368
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:23,372
You meet any hot social workers,
you get their number.

369
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,302
Go downstairs.

370
00:29:31,415 --> 00:29:32,473
-Torch?
-Yeah?

371
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,249
Was my mom a good cook?

372
00:29:37,254 --> 00:29:38,744
Yeah, Willie, she was a good cook.

373
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:42,016
And she could grow stuff too,
couldn't she?

374
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:44,092
Radishes and stuff.

375
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,752
I remember I used to help her water.

376
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:50,160
Think we could start
growing stuff again, Torch?

377
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:51,994
Torch?

378
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,528
She's not gonna get
any more dead, man.

379
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,901
-You watch your mouth!
-Look.

380
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:03,712
She was my mom.
I can talk about her if I want to.

381
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,010
She's not gonna get any more dead
if you sleep where it's clean.

382
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:13,953
Or eat regular food like a person,
or be nice to some girl you like.

383
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:16,691
She's as dead as she's gonna get.

384
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:20,755
I hope you flunk your English test.

385
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:25,231
Too late, it was yesterday.
And I aced it.

386
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,407
<i>Laurie, it was unbelievable.</i>

387
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,672
The way these people
have been treated.

388
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,372
When they get to quarantine,
they put tattoos on them.

389
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,576
These big P's for positive,
so they can track them down with radar.

390
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,812
Do you swear to me,
that when this is over...

391
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:49,322
...you'll forget
this entire thing ever existed?

392
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:51,427
I mean it, Blue.

393
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,119
This is it.

394
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,225
Right up that ramp.

395
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,930
Come on.

396
00:30:57,134 --> 00:31:01,537
We fix cars here, ma'am.
You want a doctor, find a hospital.

397
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:05,471
They know me. I was here last night.
I know what's behind that curtain.

398
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:08,404
If you'll excuse me,
I have a lot of work to do.

399
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:10,603
My friend needs somebody
to give her the test.

400
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:13,147
We don't wanna go back
to Helping Hand.

401
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:15,181
-Boss!
-I think maybe we should just go.

402
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,480
-No.
-Hey!

403
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:22,887
You wouldn't believe this, Laurie.
Beds, medicine, hospital stuff.

404
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,794
What is this?

405
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:30,399
We crossed the continental divide
of weirdness.

406
00:31:31,668 --> 00:31:33,465
You wanna take the test?

407
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:36,037
Be under the 4th Street bridge
in an hour.

408
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:37,939
Just the two of you.

409
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:41,870
Anybody else shows up,
this doesn't happen.

410
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:46,972
No.

411
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:48,408
-No.
-Come on.

412
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:49,882
-No.
-Come on.

413
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:55,420
So who's this person
who's such a big emergency?

414
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:59,026
Nobody.
Just somebody I met in the park.

415
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:04,724
All right, now, you just hold real steady.

416
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:09,000
Are you sure this is sanitary out here?

417
00:32:09,172 --> 00:32:11,936
You mean without any magazines
and a waiting room?

418
00:32:12,108 --> 00:32:14,440
In the Helping Hand clinic
where I work...

419
00:32:14,611 --> 00:32:17,239
...we got all the white tile
you could ever want.

420
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:19,779
And I wouldn't go there
to get my nose blown.

421
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:21,177
You work for them?

422
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:24,752
Not every double agent
wears a trench coat.

423
00:32:26,256 --> 00:32:27,280
Somebody's coming.

424
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:31,451
Not to worry,
just our friendly mobile testing unit.

425
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:33,629
Instant results around the clock.

426
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:36,766
I don't know if I'm ready for instant.

427
00:32:44,274 --> 00:32:45,400
Hi.

428
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:51,740
The keys are in the cab, Anna.

429
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:54,577
The equipment's running a little hot,
should be okay, though.

430
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:56,048
What's his problem?

431
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:58,846
Who cares?

432
00:33:06,096 --> 00:33:08,826
Torch. Hey, Torch,
what is your problem?

433
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:12,162
Hey, I ain't got no problem
except for you yelling at me.

434
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,326
I don't get this.

435
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:16,572
What we went through last night,
and then--

436
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,503
Did I get you pregnant and leave you
by the roadside somewhere?

437
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:22,611
-I don't remember this.
-I am not talking about marriage.

438
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:24,906
I'm talking about saying hello.

439
00:33:26,616 --> 00:33:28,015
Hello.

440
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:30,847
I'm okay.

441
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:35,022
Blue, I'm okay. She said
it's just allergies or something.

442
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:38,554
Oh, God.

443
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:46,559
Let's get out of here.
My mom's on nightshift.

444
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:50,502
-We got some major celebrating to do.
-Thank you, guys, so much. Thank you.

445
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:53,404
-Does it feel good to say I told you so.
-Blue.

446
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,144
Blue.

447
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:58,907
-What?
-Look....

448
00:33:59,215 --> 00:34:03,242
Just because he's messed up
doesn't mean we don't need the help.

449
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,548
Is there any way somebody
could get ahold of you, ever?

450
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:09,624
What do you mean, in case Mr. Hero
needs someone to impress?

451
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:11,488
Blue.

452
00:34:15,498 --> 00:34:18,365
You take care of yourself, okay?

453
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:43,255
Blue? Aren't you gonna show up
to your own party?

454
00:34:43,426 --> 00:34:45,587
You want a beer or something?

455
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,315
Fuck.

456
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:55,496
Hey, what are you doing in here?
People are starting to wonder.

457
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,396
What's that thing on your head?

458
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,734
I guess you think everything in the world
is just wonderful now.

459
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,380
Fine.

460
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:21,513
Maybe it's all true. Maybe all this
terrible stuff is actually happening.

461
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:25,149
But, Blue, you're crazy if you think
that there is one thing...

462
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:28,024
...that you or I or anybody else
can do about it.

463
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:30,260
I guess I don't see it that way.

464
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:34,563
Just don't do anything stupid, okay?
Please? I mean, really.

465
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:36,330
Hey, you guys, you gotta hear this.

466
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:39,133
<i>The mobilization of the forces</i>
<i>that have been on alert...</i>

467
00:36:39,309 --> 00:36:41,106
<i>...since yesterday's</i>
<i>unprovoked attack.</i>

468
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:46,738
<i>We have acted decisively</i>
<i>and we have acted justly.</i>

469
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,585
<i>We have acted because we cannot...</i>

470
00:36:50,787 --> 00:36:54,780
<i>...must not allow tyranny</i>
<i>to cast its evil shadow.</i>

471
00:36:55,091 --> 00:37:01,621
<i>We have acted because</i>
<i>as long as one man is not free...</i>

472
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,259
<i>...no man is free.</i>

473
00:37:05,435 --> 00:37:08,666
-Yeah. All right, yeah.
-Yeah.

474
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,534
Hey, Blue.

475
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:50,938
We could use an extra hand tonight.

476
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:53,446
What, the regular girl call in sick?

477
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:56,743
Look, I'm sorry.

478
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:00,817
What do you want?
You want me to eat dirt, I'll eat dirt.

479
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:02,389
That would be nice.

480
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,639
Chicken.

481
00:38:58,081 --> 00:38:59,446
Laurie.

482
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:04,280
-Where's Blue?
-I don't know.

483
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,831
Hey.

484
00:39:25,308 --> 00:39:26,332
Oh, hi, man.

485
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,103
Use them, okay?

486
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:34,442
The bleach, the needles, everything.

487
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:41,488
-Got anybody I could use this with?
-Not my department.

488
00:39:48,398 --> 00:39:49,990
Where the hell you been, man?

489
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:54,894
-Hey, Willie.
-Hey, Blue.

490
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:08,012
-There you are.
-Hi.

491
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:09,617
Hey.

492
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:14,985
Listen, Laurie, I need some help,
and I don't know who else to turn to.

493
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:17,286
Help with what?

494
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,155
Is Blue having some sort of problem?

495
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,030
Why would you think
that she was having a problem?

496
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:26,495
Well, she seems so down these days,
you know?

497
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:30,435
That's too bad,
because there's so much to be up about.

498
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,574
Things are really starting
to come together.

499
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:36,075
She's fine. She's perfectly happy.

500
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:38,543
Hey, Laurie, how about this--?

501
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:45,281
But Blue
is having some sort of problem.

502
00:40:45,455 --> 00:40:48,288
When the cops get wind of it...

503
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:51,291
...you're gonna wish real hard
that you wouldn't let someone...

504
00:40:51,494 --> 00:40:55,863
...who's Blue's friend get her out of it
before it was too late.

505
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,460
Blue's fine.

506
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:01,699
Okay.

507
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,742
Can you believe that somebody
would name their kid Drusilla?

508
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,814
-Criminal.
-It was after some aunt of my dad's.

509
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:20,547
But my mom turned it
to Dru pretty fast.

510
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,349
Bucky couldn't even say that.

511
00:41:23,526 --> 00:41:26,256
All he could say was Blue.

512
00:41:26,796 --> 00:41:29,196
I guess it kind of stuck.

513
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:37,099
Hey, it's your turn.

514
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:41,635
-What's this for?
-For your face.

515
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:44,143
Oh, yeah.

516
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:47,845
I got mine from Willie's mom.

517
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:51,314
She hated her own name. Ellen.

518
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:56,424
She said it sounded like someone
who won prizes for their handwriting.

519
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,628
I kind of liked it, but I said, ''Okay, we
should make up names for each other...

520
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:04,562
...only you had to take the name
you got given, period.

521
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:06,759
No going back.''

522
00:42:10,306 --> 00:42:14,800
We-- We wrote our names on the inside
of matchbook covers, right?

523
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:19,342
We switched,
counted to three and looked.

524
00:42:21,517 --> 00:42:26,545
I don't know where she came up with it,
but she put down Torch.

525
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,386
I put down Ellen.

526
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:34,462
We nearly killed each other
on the spot.

527
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:42,331
What was your name before?

528
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:48,608
I can't say.
That was another part of the deal.

529
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:51,178
Who was Willie's father?

530
00:42:51,514 --> 00:42:53,209
She got pregnant on the job.

531
00:42:53,382 --> 00:42:57,284
You know, she said meeting me
got her out of the trade...

532
00:42:57,453 --> 00:43:00,786
...but Willie pretty much talked her
out of it before I ever came along.

533
00:43:01,057 --> 00:43:03,150
What happened to her?

534
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:11,591
Sure. You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

535
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,607
Well....

536
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,638
It was in the beginning...

537
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:25,940
...when they first started
taking people away.

538
00:43:26,716 --> 00:43:30,152
The whole world was sticking
its fucking head in the sand.

539
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:32,753
Oh, but not her, no.

540
00:43:32,922 --> 00:43:37,484
She had this crazy idea that sick people
were supposed to get taken care of.

541
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,155
She started making trouble,
driving people up the wall.

542
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:46,797
They wanted her bad.

543
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,528
When they raided this place
we were staying...

544
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:53,471
...she was the only one they took.
The troublemaker.

545
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:03,247
One morning, Willie wakes up,
and she's just not there anymore.

546
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:06,382
The way I heard it...

547
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:10,151
...when she came up positive,
they broke out the champagne.

548
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,294
It meant this time,
they had her for good.

549
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:15,796
No paperwork.

550
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:19,026
They were very interested
in what she could tell them...

551
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:22,399
...about her secret terrorist network.

552
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:25,172
And the doctors who were present...

553
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:32,007
...knew how to be effective
in their interrogation.

554
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,111
Because....

555
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:38,186
Because what the--
What the blood test also showed...

556
00:44:38,354 --> 00:44:41,585
...was that the subject...

557
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:45,818
...was somewhere between
three- and five-months pregnant.

558
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,661
Patients in the quarantine tried
to take care of her...

559
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,529
...but after a beating like that....

560
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:55,898
Was it your baby?

561
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:54,546
Where did you toss Willie's bag?

562
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:12,701
Can you feel anything with that on?

563
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,636
Enough.

564
00:47:26,522 --> 00:47:29,582
Did you know she was sick
before she got caught?

565
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:33,153
They call it denial.

566
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:40,124
Sorry.

567
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:42,728
Sorry.

568
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:49,203
Have you ever taken the test?

569
00:47:51,547 --> 00:47:53,879
Everybody's got these calendars
in their head.

570
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:56,711
So you find out you got five years.
So, what do you do?

571
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:59,078
Start X-ing off the days
in your datebook?

572
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:02,418
Take the necessary precautions
and you go from there.

573
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,957
All that stuff they say
about nothing being safe--

574
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:09,188
Hey, Torch.
You got anything for breakfast?

575
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:12,196
-Where's my shirt?
-Hey, you ever heard of knocking, man?

576
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:14,832
I'm starving, man.

577
00:48:15,004 --> 00:48:17,939
We'll pick up a donut
on the way to the bus.

578
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:21,133
He's a growing boy.
You can't give him donuts for breakfast.

579
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,302
I get him the jelly kind,
it's got fruit inside.

580
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:27,175
Tell me you didn't actually say that.

581
00:48:28,517 --> 00:48:31,042
Well, don't wake me till Christmas.

582
00:48:31,253 --> 00:48:34,051
No, no, no. You gotta get home
before your brother gets up.

583
00:48:34,223 --> 00:48:38,956
-He can go to hell.
-Very bad attitude.

584
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:41,653
-You got a cover to keep now.
-I do?

585
00:48:41,931 --> 00:48:46,231
Please, no bright-eyed idealism
before I get my coffee, all right?

586
00:48:47,336 --> 00:48:50,703
Morning, guys.
Do you need a toothbrush, Blue?

587
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:55,167
-Don't worry, it's brand-new.
-Thanks.

588
00:49:02,418 --> 00:49:03,510
Torch?

589
00:49:05,454 --> 00:49:07,445
Come on, man.

590
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:23,254
Peace for all, little brother.

591
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:59,460
See, it's not so bad.

592
00:52:04,033 --> 00:52:05,796
Nice and slow.

593
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:09,800
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

594
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:14,203
It's okay. Okay--

595
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:18,704
Ma.

596
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:22,946
-Ma.
-You take it easy, I'll be right back.

597
00:52:24,286 --> 00:52:26,447
Where are you, Ma?

598
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:28,449
Ma.

599
00:52:28,624 --> 00:52:30,114
Ma.

600
00:52:30,759 --> 00:52:34,160
-Ma.
-I'm right here.

601
00:52:42,004 --> 00:52:44,802
I guess you couldn't get Dad
to come, huh?

602
00:52:49,912 --> 00:52:52,210
No, no, he's here,
he's right over there.

603
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:04,792
He's coming.

604
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,164
Hey.

605
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:16,866
-It's Russell.
-Russell.

606
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,370
Hey, Dad.

607
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:24,574
You don't still hate me, huh?

608
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:28,581
No, I don't hate you, Russ.

609
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:40,121
I love you, Russell.

610
00:53:41,997 --> 00:53:45,592
I love you too, Dad. I love you, Dad.

611
00:53:53,408 --> 00:53:55,876
So why haven't I heard
any hot details yet?

612
00:53:56,178 --> 00:53:57,577
Because there haven't been any.

613
00:53:57,746 --> 00:54:01,147
Every night with this guy for a month
and I'm supposed to believe that?

614
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:03,580
-That's right.
-Well, I don't.

615
00:54:03,752 --> 00:54:05,617
Laurie, when have I ever lied to you?

616
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:08,085
Fifth grade. Scott Berkowitz.

617
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,191
You promised me that you would
never ever mention that again.

618
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,921
How could you do it, Blue?
He smelled like pastrami farts.

619
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:17,725
Actually, it was more like corned beef
when you got up close.

620
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,333
Stop.

621
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:24,705
-What are you looking at my watch for?
-Just wanted to see what time it was.

622
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:26,431
Well, what's your hurry?

623
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:29,611
We haven't had a normal conversation
in a million years.

624
00:54:29,778 --> 00:54:31,143
I mean, come on.

625
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:34,840
Why can't you put up posters
a half an hour later?

626
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:41,153
We're not exactly
putting up posters today.

627
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:44,893
-Then what are you doing?
-You don't want to know.

628
00:54:45,227 --> 00:54:47,491
Don't tell me what I don't want.

629
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:50,257
If I got caught,
you'd be better off not knowing.

630
00:54:50,432 --> 00:54:51,763
Just tell me.

631
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:56,831
I miss talking to you, Blue.
I miss telling each other everything.

632
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:03,110
We found out that there's
this Helping Hand clinic in New Jersey...

633
00:55:03,278 --> 00:55:04,643
...that's closing tonight.

634
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:08,271
And they're shipping everybody
that they're holding to quarantine.

635
00:55:08,483 --> 00:55:10,849
And you're gonna rescue them
on the way?

636
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:14,216
Yeah, we're gonna get them
into safe houses.

637
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:18,424
These people you're rescuing them from,
they don't have guns?

638
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:22,797
Blue.

639
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:26,662
We have guns too, Laurie.

640
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:30,196
Blue, don't go, okay?

641
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:32,840
Really, don't go. Just, don't do it.

642
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:35,268
It's 70 people.

643
00:55:35,444 --> 00:55:37,776
They're gonna lock them up
and starve them.

644
00:55:39,448 --> 00:55:43,043
I just don't think, you know,
if this guy really loved you...

645
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:46,312
...he wouldn't want you
to be in all this danger all the time.

646
00:55:46,488 --> 00:55:48,786
It's not about him.

647
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:51,723
It's just....

648
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:55,522
I don't know, you get put on this planet
and what do you do with that?

649
00:55:55,697 --> 00:55:56,823
So, what are you saying?

650
00:55:57,132 --> 00:56:00,226
You telling me I'm fucked up
because I wanna have a normal life?

651
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:03,394
-I'm not saying that, you know it.
-No, I don't.

652
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:07,607
I don't know anything.

653
00:56:12,648 --> 00:56:18,143
-I have no intentions of getting killed.
-Nobody ever does.

654
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:28,629
Well, I gotta go.

655
00:56:32,134 --> 00:56:33,829
So go.

656
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:38,630
Call you tomorrow morning?

657
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:41,408
You're gonna be late.

658
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:51,549
Go on.

659
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:01,758
Truck's coming in a little early, Torch.

660
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:03,295
You'd better hurry up.

661
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:05,592
-No escort?
<i>-Not that I can see.</i>

662
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:08,497
<i>And I can see all the way to Canada.</i>

663
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,729
You got enough people down there
for this?

664
00:57:11,406 --> 00:57:13,840
We got everybody we know
out here, Willie.

665
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:16,134
Now you stay low.

666
00:57:25,187 --> 00:57:26,518
Hold it.

667
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:42,228
-Nobody move.
-You rat.

668
00:57:44,439 --> 00:57:46,464
Now,
if you kindly drop your weapons...

669
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:50,338
...and put your hands in the air. Now.

670
00:57:50,812 --> 00:57:53,713
Put it in the truck. Do it.

671
00:57:58,553 --> 00:58:00,350
-Get it open!
-It's not holding.

672
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:03,355
-Come on.
-Kick it open.

673
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,558
Let's go. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

674
00:58:10,665 --> 00:58:13,691
We did it. We fucking did it, come on.

675
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:26,779
-Hands on the truck, come on.
-Where are you, man? I can't see you.

676
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:37,885
<i>Wherever you are, get out</i>
<i>to Pearl Street, you'll be in the clear.</i>

677
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:42,160
-What is it?
-My walkie.

678
00:58:44,166 --> 00:58:45,793
Check under the bridge.

679
00:58:54,276 --> 00:58:55,937
<i>Cancel that about Pearl Street.</i>

680
00:58:56,111 --> 00:58:59,205
<i>It's starting to look like</i>
<i>a cop convention down there.</i>

681
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,975
<i>-If you're holed up somewhere, sit tight.</i>
-Shut up.

682
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,674
It's a kid.

683
00:59:03,852 --> 00:59:05,945
It's not a kid, man, it's a sniper.

684
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:09,454
<i>Torch, where are you?</i>
<i>Come on, Torch, answer me.</i>

685
00:59:09,624 --> 00:59:13,617
<i>I can't see you.</i>
<i>What's going on down there?</i>

686
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:16,764
There he is, captain.
I got a clear shot at his ass.

687
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:21,561
-No!
-Torch!

688
00:59:24,206 --> 00:59:26,538
Willie!

689
00:59:30,345 --> 00:59:32,905
-No!
-Give me your fucking hands.

690
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:36,241
No! Willie!

691
00:59:37,185 --> 00:59:40,484
Willie! No!

692
00:59:40,655 --> 00:59:42,714
No! Get it on the radio.

693
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,655
Get off-- Get off me!

694
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:51,428
Willie!

695
00:59:57,205 --> 00:59:59,173
Bucky, come here.

696
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:11,749
Now you know why
we had to come out here today.

697
01:00:11,953 --> 01:00:15,684
But it's cool, man.
People make mistakes.

698
01:00:15,857 --> 01:00:19,623
Instead you'll have to keep an eye on her
now, make sure she learned her lesson.

699
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:22,888
I can count on you for that, can't I?

700
01:00:24,132 --> 01:00:25,565
In the car.

701
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,514
Oh, Willie. Oh, my God.

702
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:01,092
Willie.

703
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:02,993
How could they have found out?

704
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:04,835
Somebody told them.

705
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,405
Yeah, somebody who knew exactly
what was coming down today.

706
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:11,273
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying somebody fucked us!

707
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:13,107
Are you accusing me?

708
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:15,249
Who else?
She's been with Helping Hand for--

709
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:19,682
Shut up, shut up!
Would you just shut up?!

710
01:01:29,297 --> 01:01:31,822
Come on, we gotta get out of here
before they come back.

711
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,233
Safest way's under the highway.
Let's go.

712
01:01:36,871 --> 01:01:37,963
Come on!

713
01:01:43,445 --> 01:01:44,469
I'll make you a deal.

714
01:01:44,679 --> 01:01:48,274
You give me the whereabouts
of just one kidnapped positive...

715
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,281
...and we can all get some sleep.

716
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,651
Does that hurt?

717
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:56,723
One name. One address.

718
01:01:57,392 --> 01:01:59,360
Santa Claus.

719
01:02:00,228 --> 01:02:01,855
The North Pole.

720
01:02:04,866 --> 01:02:09,701
Safe houses.
Addresses, phone numbers.

721
01:02:09,871 --> 01:02:11,702
-Hey!
-What?

722
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,936
He won't be much use to you
if he's dead.

723
01:02:23,952 --> 01:02:25,749
Okay.

724
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:40,366
I'd kind of hold off on that
for a minute if I were you.

725
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:45,700
We just got the blood work
in on this one, and in a word, positive.

726
01:02:46,508 --> 01:02:48,203
Dead man.

727
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:50,873
Fucking bastard!

728
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:24,969
<i>Looks like some clear skies</i>
<i>ahead of us.</i>

729
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:27,580
<i>Enemy casualties are reported high</i>
<i>in heavy fighting.</i>

730
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:30,183
You're not Egan.

731
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,915
What happened to Egan?

732
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:37,182
What do you think happened to Egan?

733
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:40,355
Welcome to Tri-State Regional
Quarantine.

734
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:46,128
<i>Channel Six spoke with the young hero</i>
<i>of the mass arrest.</i>

735
01:03:46,301 --> 01:03:48,826
<i>It's not just us</i>
<i>who make these things happen, you see.</i>

736
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,695
<i>It's also the fine regular people</i>
<i>out there...</i>

737
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:54,103
<i>...who know what's wrong</i>
<i>when they see it.</i>

738
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:56,277
<i>And they're not afraid</i>
<i>to speak up about it.</i>

739
01:03:56,444 --> 01:03:59,106
<i>Because, I mean, I don't care</i>
<i>what kind of line-up you got.</i>

740
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:03,216
<i>You ain't gonna win no football games</i>
<i>if you ain't got the crowd out there.</i>

741
01:05:01,876 --> 01:05:03,400
Blue?

742
01:05:35,376 --> 01:05:37,503
Are you sure he has it?

743
01:05:38,546 --> 01:05:41,538
You think Anna would've said so
if she wasn't sure?

744
01:05:43,384 --> 01:05:45,614
Oh, God, Blue.

745
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:49,817
You didn't sleep with him ever,
did you?

746
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,227
-Willie's dead.
-What?

747
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:02,733
Hunter shot him.

748
01:06:05,139 --> 01:06:06,367
He's dead?

749
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:09,835
Yeah, we just buried him today.

750
01:06:14,148 --> 01:06:16,742
He swore he wouldn't do--

751
01:06:16,918 --> 01:06:19,216
What? Who swore?
What are you talking about?

752
01:06:20,588 --> 01:06:22,488
Laurie?

753
01:06:22,757 --> 01:06:24,384
What?

754
01:06:25,693 --> 01:06:27,991
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

755
01:06:28,563 --> 01:06:30,224
What did you do?

756
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:34,562
You told him?

757
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:37,203
-You told Hunter?
-I was so scared, Blue.

758
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:40,671
I didn't want you to die
or wreck your life.

759
01:06:41,075 --> 01:06:44,408
Listen, they promised me
they weren't gonna hurt anybody.

760
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:46,979
-They swore. Come back here!
-No.

761
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:49,514
Blue, Blue,
I need to talk to you, right now.

762
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:51,810
Talk to me, talk to me.

763
01:06:58,059 --> 01:07:00,152
Oh, shit.

764
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:05,929
Stop doing this.

765
01:07:06,467 --> 01:07:08,992
Right now
is when we should be very careful...

766
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,730
...with how we use our energies.

767
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,667
Energies?

768
01:07:19,614 --> 01:07:21,377
Hey, Blue.

769
01:07:21,716 --> 01:07:24,184
Blue, wait a minute.

770
01:07:24,352 --> 01:07:26,877
We have to decide about stuff.

771
01:07:27,055 --> 01:07:30,115
-What stuff?
-Everything.

772
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:34,723
Planning stuff.
Getting everybody back on track.

773
01:07:35,296 --> 01:07:39,323
I can't believe
you're just gonna let it all go to pieces.

774
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,099
It's okay, it's okay. It's me.

775
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:27,304
-How did you find me?
-I followed you, the other night.

776
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:29,414
Leave.

777
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:35,453
I swear to you, I did not have anything
to do with the raid.

778
01:08:35,723 --> 01:08:39,284
Fine. You were just following orders
and God forgives you.

779
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,587
Now would you go away?

780
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:47,561
I found you a way to see him.
The guy you were with.

781
01:08:48,736 --> 01:08:50,169
What?

782
01:08:50,738 --> 01:08:53,070
I don't know what else I can do.

783
01:08:53,975 --> 01:08:55,602
I can't get him out.

784
01:08:55,777 --> 01:08:59,804
-I can't stop what's happening.
-Nobody can get into quarantine.

785
01:09:00,148 --> 01:09:04,585
Yeah? It's all just money
and connections like everything else.

786
01:09:04,752 --> 01:09:07,380
But you gotta meet the driver
in a half an hour or forget it.

787
01:09:07,555 --> 01:09:09,352
Money, what money?

788
01:09:09,524 --> 01:09:12,322
Guess who just got elected treasurer
of your local home guard?

789
01:09:12,493 --> 01:09:14,256
Jesus, Bucky.

790
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:18,331
What if Hunter kills you,
what do I do for a brother?

791
01:09:20,268 --> 01:09:22,793
If you hate me for the rest of my life...

792
01:09:23,571 --> 01:09:25,630
...what do I do for a sister?

793
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,338
Don't let anybody get a close look
at that thing.

794
01:09:35,316 --> 01:09:37,648
When I get inside, how will I find him?

795
01:09:37,852 --> 01:09:41,413
Usually, they take the new arrivals
to the Helms wing.

796
01:09:43,091 --> 01:09:44,683
Okay.

797
01:09:45,727 --> 01:09:49,094
I make my delivery,
take care of my business.

798
01:09:49,263 --> 01:09:51,857
Back where I dropped you off
at 6, 6:05.

799
01:09:52,066 --> 01:09:55,763
Now you hear that clock-bell ringing,
you get down there.

800
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,765
You don't show up....

801
01:09:57,972 --> 01:10:01,408
-She doesn't show up, what?
-They find out that the tattoo's fake.

802
01:10:01,876 --> 01:10:05,403
-They shoot her on the spot.
-Jesus.

803
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,180
Do you have a watch?

804
01:10:09,117 --> 01:10:10,482
Yeah.

805
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,748
You'd better synchronize.
What time do you have?

806
01:10:16,023 --> 01:10:17,547
Two forty-seven.

807
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:20,592
Now the drop off's gonna be
around the corner on White Street.

808
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:22,593
About 6:30.

809
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:26,995
-Come on, set your watch.
-I will when I get in.

810
01:10:27,535 --> 01:10:30,436
You don't have a watch.
Don't be crazy.

811
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:33,130
Bye, Bucky. Tell Mom I love her.

812
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:37,244
Blue, don't do this!

813
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:52,555
All right, you're clear.

814
01:11:20,154 --> 01:11:23,783
-How you doing tonight, man?
-How do you think I'm doing?

815
01:11:24,258 --> 01:11:28,194
-Did you get that radiator fixed?
-Yeah, I got it fixed.

816
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:32,456
-Take you a long time?
-Yeah, took me a while.

817
01:11:47,915 --> 01:11:49,780
Passed curfew, babe. Get inside.

818
01:11:50,117 --> 01:11:51,584
Okay.

819
01:11:52,153 --> 01:11:54,678
This one's still warm enough.

820
01:12:05,299 --> 01:12:07,392
<i>Gonna be the end of our marriage</i>
<i>if you go on.</i>

821
01:12:07,568 --> 01:12:09,468
<i>I've had enough.</i>
<i>Don't you realize that?</i>

822
01:12:09,637 --> 01:12:13,471
<i>You've had enough?</i>
<i>Other people drink.</i>

823
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:17,202
<i>-Not the way you do.</i>
<i>-Why?</i>

824
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:21,708
<i>-What's wrong with me?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

825
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,644
<i>You've got everything in the world</i>
<i>that you want.</i>

826
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:34,658
-Friend of yours?
<i>-Tim, help me.</i>

827
01:12:35,196 --> 01:12:36,288
<i>Help me.</i>

828
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:40,098
-Hi.
-Did they hurt you?

829
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:42,427
They didn't get me. I snuck in.

830
01:12:43,738 --> 01:12:46,605
You snuck in? You crazy fuck.

831
01:12:46,874 --> 01:12:49,775
-You got a way to get out?
-Yeah.

832
01:12:50,111 --> 01:12:52,875
My ride's at 6:00 at Receiving.

833
01:13:04,392 --> 01:13:06,292
In there. Go in there.

834
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,665
You shouldn't have come here.
They'll shoot you.

835
01:13:18,839 --> 01:13:22,707
-No, no, don't talk. Don't say anything.
-Watch the blood.

836
01:13:29,517 --> 01:13:31,508
What did they do to you?

837
01:13:32,486 --> 01:13:34,579
Did they get Willie?

838
01:13:35,156 --> 01:13:37,624
-Torch.
-His body, did they get his body?

839
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:40,251
No.

840
01:13:44,165 --> 01:13:46,190
Come on. Sit on the bed.

841
01:13:46,634 --> 01:13:48,067
Come.

842
01:14:06,921 --> 01:14:08,855
-All right, put your hands up.
-What?

843
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,514
I wanna get this shirt off you.
It's filthy, come on.

844
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:22,863
Lie back. Lie back.

845
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:36,177
Oh, it feels good, Blue.

846
01:14:41,255 --> 01:14:43,314
Feels too good.

847
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:47,320
There's no such thing.

848
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:49,188
What are you doing?

849
01:14:51,632 --> 01:14:53,327
-We gotta get--
-No, no.

850
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:55,731
They don't scare me.

851
01:15:02,276 --> 01:15:04,107
No, no, what are you doing?

852
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:07,042
Look, I can stay as long as I want.

853
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:09,341
It's a counterfeit black mark.
It's special.

854
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:12,509
You know how fast
that thing's gonna peel off?

855
01:15:23,197 --> 01:15:26,098
Boy, would they love this.

856
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,496
A negative dropping in on a boyfriend.

857
01:15:30,938 --> 01:15:33,839
Would they make an example or what?

858
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,742
Not if she wasn't negative anymore.

859
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,658
You came here to off yourself.

860
01:15:53,627 --> 01:15:57,222
-I came here to be with you.
-No.

861
01:15:57,431 --> 01:15:59,160
Come on.

862
01:16:01,368 --> 01:16:05,031
-You've got your whole life to live.
-Don't tell me what I got.

863
01:16:06,207 --> 01:16:07,572
Blue.

864
01:16:11,112 --> 01:16:13,706
We never got to go to the movies.

865
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:17,248
We never got to go out for breakfast.

866
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:26,085
Medic squad, checkup time.

867
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,524
-Get to the door or I'm coming in.
-Hit the light.

868
01:16:29,296 --> 01:16:30,456
Get out of sight.

869
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:32,599
Get to the door.

870
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:38,867
-Back off. Back-- Back off.
-Okay, okay.

871
01:16:39,573 --> 01:16:41,632
You know what to do.

872
01:16:41,809 --> 01:16:44,039
Come on, lift the arms.
All the way, all the way.

873
01:16:49,717 --> 01:16:51,241
All right, pants.

874
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:55,216
Shorts too.

875
01:16:57,558 --> 01:16:59,423
Come on, turn around.

876
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:03,528
-What's that?
-It's a mole, we've been through this.

877
01:17:03,697 --> 01:17:05,221
Crack a smile.

878
01:17:08,035 --> 01:17:10,094
All right, you're clean.

879
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:16,776
-What's that?
-It's a hooker, I got a hooker up here.

880
01:17:16,944 --> 01:17:19,139
What, you got Chinese food
up here too?

881
01:17:19,346 --> 01:17:21,507
-Yeah, you know how it is.
-Yeah?

882
01:17:21,682 --> 01:17:23,650
Get her out here. Come on!

883
01:17:23,817 --> 01:17:26,081
Hey, come out here.

884
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:30,386
-Hey, bitch!
-I'm coming, I just hurt my leg.

885
01:17:31,158 --> 01:17:33,558
-You okay?
-Yeah.

886
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:35,194
What do you care?

887
01:17:35,829 --> 01:17:37,296
I've never seen you before.

888
01:17:37,464 --> 01:17:40,456
Yeah, she just got Q'd
a couple of hours ago.

889
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:44,468
Working fast, huh?
Show me your label.

890
01:17:45,873 --> 01:17:48,671
Come on, move out of the way, huh?

891
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:53,138
-Can't see it good.
-Can you see it now?

892
01:17:53,314 --> 01:17:55,441
It's very nice. I see it, all right.

893
01:17:57,952 --> 01:18:01,183
-Show me her tits.
-What?

894
01:18:01,355 --> 01:18:04,620
Hey, I'm here.
I might as well kill two birds, huh?

895
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:07,352
-Now show me her tits.
-I'll show you.

896
01:18:07,528 --> 01:18:10,827
No, no. I want him to do it.

897
01:18:11,632 --> 01:18:13,623
Show me her tits.

898
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:17,193
Come on.

899
01:18:28,649 --> 01:18:29,911
Rub them.

900
01:18:30,084 --> 01:18:32,143
-Mister--
-Don't ''mister'' me.

901
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:35,846
She's here after curfew.
She ain't even on my list.

902
01:18:36,257 --> 01:18:41,559
You two ain't got any symptoms yet.
I hardly ever get that.

903
01:18:42,329 --> 01:18:46,197
Rub her tits.

904
01:18:51,105 --> 01:18:53,369
No, not there. Not there. Tits.

905
01:18:54,608 --> 01:18:56,735
Come on. Rub them, rub them.

906
01:19:05,686 --> 01:19:09,281
Show me her--
Show me her bush.

907
01:19:13,427 --> 01:19:15,554
I wanna see it.

908
01:19:21,769 --> 01:19:24,431
Hey, you making friends down there?

909
01:19:27,174 --> 01:19:30,371
No, sir, I'll be right out.

910
01:19:33,647 --> 01:19:38,380
See you two tomorrow. You got it?

911
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:50,155
That's it. You're out of here.

912
01:20:04,278 --> 01:20:06,337
I want you to go down this ladder.

913
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:09,141
And I want you to cut through
by emergency down there.

914
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:11,442
That'll take you right to Receiving.
Come on.

915
01:20:11,618 --> 01:20:13,449
I'm not going.

916
01:20:13,821 --> 01:20:16,221
You want to go through
that shit again?

917
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:22,329
I want to stay here with you
and finish what I started.

918
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:27,565
Yeah? Yeah?
You want me to fuck you?

919
01:20:27,735 --> 01:20:29,635
Is that what you want? Come on.

920
01:20:29,837 --> 01:20:31,236
-Is that what you want?
-Stop.

921
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:33,464
You want me to fuck you? Shut up!

922
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:34,902
I'll fuck you.

923
01:20:35,175 --> 01:20:38,611
And in every drop of me there'll be
a trillion little poison cockroaches...

924
01:20:38,779 --> 01:20:43,182
...floating around inside of you
for a year, five years, or more.

925
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:45,341
You'll be checking yourself up
20 times a day.

926
01:20:45,519 --> 01:20:47,487
You're hurting me, Torch.

927
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,421
You put your dress back on
and go back.

928
01:20:55,596 --> 01:20:57,723
What--? What--? What do I do?

929
01:20:57,898 --> 01:21:01,163
Live. Whatever that means, you live.

930
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:04,099
You can't just live, not without--

931
01:21:04,271 --> 01:21:08,605
-What? Without love?
-Come on, Torch.

932
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:20,150
We can live as good as we can
for as long as we can.

933
01:21:21,655 --> 01:21:26,183
We can grow old together
even if it doesn't take so long.

934
01:21:29,062 --> 01:21:30,825
We could fix up the place.

935
01:21:31,131 --> 01:21:33,793
We could see
if we could get some paint somewhere.

936
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:36,501
We're gonna have to be careful
on how we make it look.

937
01:21:36,703 --> 01:21:40,104
Because in a hundred years...

938
01:21:41,642 --> 01:21:45,544
...they're gonna be bringing people
through here on guided tours.

939
01:21:49,216 --> 01:21:52,674
Behind the velvet rope over there,
some--

940
01:21:52,853 --> 01:21:54,252
Some lady with blue hair...

941
01:21:54,421 --> 01:22:00,553
...is gonna be giving a lecture
on how Torch...

942
01:22:00,727 --> 01:22:04,720
...the father of the resistance,
lived in this humble room.

943
01:22:04,998 --> 01:22:07,091
Died in this humble room.

944
01:22:12,105 --> 01:22:13,663
Not alone.

945
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:21,971
It's almost time. You gotta go.

946
01:22:22,649 --> 01:22:24,276
All right.

947
01:22:25,752 --> 01:22:29,119
I'm going
as long as you tell me one thing.

948
01:22:32,059 --> 01:22:34,653
Tell me that you don't want me here.

949
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:38,293
No, no. For real.

950
01:22:38,465 --> 01:22:42,424
And you tell me
that you want to be alone...

951
01:22:43,337 --> 01:22:47,569
...when you're going blind
and your head is swelling up with sores?

952
01:22:47,774 --> 01:22:51,801
Tell me that you want me to be alone
when I know what's happening to you.

953
01:22:52,379 --> 01:22:57,510
I'm outside,
picking Pepsi cans out of the trash.

954
01:22:59,686 --> 01:23:02,246
I can't kiss your forehead.

955
01:23:03,824 --> 01:23:06,691
Bring you a glass of water.

956
01:23:08,462 --> 01:23:11,795
Or help you go to the bathroom
when you can't get out of bed.

957
01:23:14,167 --> 01:23:17,068
Tell me that's what you want
and I'm out the window.

958
01:23:19,573 --> 01:23:23,100
-Say it!
-All right, you tell me this.

959
01:23:24,044 --> 01:23:30,574
You tell me how I'm supposed to sit here
and watch you lose 80 pounds...

960
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:36,280
...and spit up mucus until you die
from what I did to you.

961
01:23:36,456 --> 01:23:37,787
No.

962
01:23:41,094 --> 01:23:42,686
Oh, no.

963
01:23:45,532 --> 01:23:49,434
As messed up as this place may be,
it's still a hospital.

964
01:23:49,636 --> 01:23:53,003
-And that means pharmaceuticals.
-So?

965
01:23:53,173 --> 01:23:56,506
So if it gets too bad,
we could just go to sleep.

966
01:24:02,649 --> 01:24:04,674
A light dinner.

967
01:24:06,086 --> 01:24:08,748
Four grams of Seconal.

968
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:12,420
Two each.

969
01:24:14,595 --> 01:24:18,087
-We just go to sleep?
-Yeah.

970
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:53,160
It's morning.

971
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:56,369
So?

972
01:24:58,138 --> 01:25:00,732
So right now, I'd be....

973
01:25:00,974 --> 01:25:02,635
I'd be....

974
01:25:04,277 --> 01:25:09,544
Now I'd be yelling at Willie
to get up for school.

975
01:25:09,716 --> 01:25:11,684
On a Saturday morning?

976
01:25:12,352 --> 01:25:14,377
-It's Saturday?
-Yeah.

977
01:25:15,555 --> 01:25:18,353
Somebody's supposed to meet the guy
from the printer's...

978
01:25:18,525 --> 01:25:20,220
...to pick up the deaf-mute cards.

979
01:25:20,394 --> 01:25:23,625
Doesn't matter, there's no one
to do anything with them anyway.

980
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:28,464
There's you.

981
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:31,760
No.

982
01:25:34,741 --> 01:25:39,235
-You've got two minutes, Blue.
-I'm not going.

983
01:25:54,428 --> 01:25:57,556
-Security!
-No!

984
01:25:57,731 --> 01:26:00,256
I got a negative in here.

985
01:26:01,468 --> 01:26:03,732
I love you, Blue.

986
01:26:09,309 --> 01:26:12,642
You'd better hurry, you just missed her.
She went down the hall.

987
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:51,179
You know,
she would've been back by now.

988
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:54,149
No, there might be traffic.
The bridge might be closed.

989
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:56,151
Yes, and pigs might fly.

990
01:26:56,323 --> 01:26:58,587
You're asking me,
this whole thing's a trap.

991
01:26:58,759 --> 01:27:00,624
What are we trusting this guy for,
anyway?

992
01:27:00,794 --> 01:27:03,024
Because he's her brother.

993
01:27:04,664 --> 01:27:06,427
Come on, Simon.

994
01:27:20,747 --> 01:27:22,942
-Blue.
-Is Torch okay?

995
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:25,145
He's okay.

996
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:29,518
-Where are they keeping him?
-Did they tattoo him yet?

997
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:34,253
Look, can we do
the press conference later?

998
01:27:34,761 --> 01:27:37,093
Right now, we got a lot to figure out.

999
01:27:37,264 --> 01:27:40,961
Like who's gonna go meet that guy
from the printer's up at the bridge?

1000
01:27:42,269 --> 01:27:44,760
-If you need me to do--
-What we need you to do...

1001
01:27:45,238 --> 01:27:47,604
...is go be an upstanding member
of the home guard.

1002
01:27:47,808 --> 01:27:49,708
Starting with getting to roll call
on time.

1003
01:27:49,876 --> 01:27:53,209
-They can go to hell.
-Bad attitude.

1004
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,777
You've got a cover to keep.

1005
01:27:56,449 --> 01:27:58,110
We both do.

1006
01:27:58,285 --> 01:28:00,185
Well, I can handle the cards.

1007
01:28:00,387 --> 01:28:03,447
Okay.
I think we owe him 20 more dollars.

1008
