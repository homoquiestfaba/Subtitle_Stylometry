1
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:48,852
Love? Love is finding
that special someone...

2
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:51,231
...you wanna spend
the rest of your life with.

3
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,607
Love is letting someone else
into your heart.

4
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:57,360
Love is giving of yourself.

5
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:00,365
Love is taking on
someone else's baggage.

6
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:02,489
- Love is hard.
- Love is a commitment.

7
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,742
Love is eternal.

8
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,653
Love is a pain in the ass.

9
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:11,362
Whatever you want to call it,
love can be crazy.

10
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,704
- Crazy.
- Crazy as shit.

11
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,123
Oh, we can't curse? Get the fuck
out of here... Oh, wait. Sorry.

12
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,537
Start over, start over.

13
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,875
And cut. That's a wrap.

14
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,003
- Excellent. You good? All right.
- I'm good.

15
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:30,790
Good work, I'll see you tomorrow.
You guys did a great job, thank you.

16
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,082
- Any calls? Thanks, Erica.
- No.

17
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,541
I'm Shante Smith.

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,253
I used to be an advertising executive
at Parker and Long in Los Angeles...

19
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:43,178
...and quite often, part-time
street therapist for my girlfriends.

20
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,511
So I decided that I could provide
a more valuable service to society...

21
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,677
...by going into business for myself.

22
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,181
So I moved to Atlanta.

23
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:54,852
Hotlanta, the breeding ground
for young athletes, musicians...

24
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:58,438
...businessmen, artists,
baby, you name it.

25
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:04,230
That also means that it's home
to several distractions.

26
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:09,647
You see, Atlanta needs me, baby...

27
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:11,282
...and Shante is here.

28
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,449
Here you go. Thank you.

29
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,486
Looking good.

30
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,380
You remember Keith, right?

31
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,051
Fine, smart, smooth and chocolate.

32
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:49,137
We had it going on.

33
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:52,258
But then he decided that
he wanted to take a job in Dubai.

34
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:54,923
I was like, " Cool. I'll go with you...

35
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,851
...as long as
you put a ring on that finger."

36
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,805
Well, he didn't wanna commit...

37
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,098
...so y'all know
what I had to do, right?

38
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:07,942
Kick his ass to the kerb.

39
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,317
But enough about that for now...

40
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:14,272
...because it's time for me
to check out the season finale...

41
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,648
...of my favourite TV show,
The Trainee.

42
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,064
So I'll holler at y'all later.

43
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:34,613
Well, you've finished
your last challenge.

44
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,363
Thus far, I've been impressed
with the both of you.

45
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:40,993
It's now time for America to
decide who is the next trainee.

46
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:44,455
America, call in.
Make your voice heard...

47
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,172
...before I make my decision.

48
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:49,543
Okay, attention everybody.
This is your last chance to call...

49
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,919
...so take out your phones
and call as many times as you can.

50
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:56,592
Please, vote for Byron, vote for Byron,
vote for Byron. I know.

51
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,302
Well, the results are in...

52
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:10,263
...and I must say,
this was a very close race.

53
00:04:10,437 --> 00:04:13,722
I'd like to congratulate the both of you
for doing outstanding jobs.

54
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:16,269
But unfortunately,
we can have only one winner.

55
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,646
Being that I'm not one to
k eep people waiting...

56
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:22,066
...I just want to tell
Mr. Byron Thomson...

57
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:24,027
...pack your bags...

58
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,318
...and bring an umbrella,
because in October...

59
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:30,188
...you'll be working with me at
my global headquarters in Seattle...

60
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,358
...because you are the next trainee.

61
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:33,648
Congratulations.

62
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:41,195
Byron won, Byron won, Byron...

63
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,705
Congratulations, Byron.

64
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,801
Yo, the trainee is here!

65
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,924
That's what's up,
know what I'm saying?

66
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,340
Yeah, baby. What's up?
That's what's up.

67
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:19,055
Gizzard Jones, what's up, baby?

68
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
- Congrats, dog.
- Thanks, man.

69
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,849
- You did your thing, man.
- Thank you...

70
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:30,186
- I couldn't have done this without you.
- You deserve it, baby.

71
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,024
When I first met Byron,
there was just something about him.

72
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:35,570
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What, what?

73
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,232
Give me this, these...

74
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:40,074
- No, no, no...
- No, that's what the eye surgery's for.

75
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,699
Now, show those beautiful eyes.

76
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,985
Then for some reason, I just had
a desire to be there for him...

77
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:49,109
...tak e care of him, and help him
become the man I knew he could be.

78
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:52,703
In the beginning, Byron was afraid
to go out for The Trainee...

79
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:57,119
...but I knew he could do it,
and look at him now. Living it up.

80
00:05:57,293 --> 00:06:01,538
Nothing mak es a woman feel better
than watching her man be a man.

81
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:05,660
And even though I wasn't a big fan
of all the attention he was getting...

82
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,088
...I still felt as though
he belonged to me.

83
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:11,215
I'm happy as all get out,
but I'm so tired.

84
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:14,384
- Tired? You better drink a Red Bull.
- How you doing?

85
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:16,011
- You see that?
- I'm so grateful...

86
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,886
- Did you see that?
- See what?

87
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:20,592
See what? See that.
Look how the women are treating you.

88
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,804
- You the man, dog!
- Come on, man.

89
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,216
I'm serious.
We gotta capitalize on this.

90
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:28,428
Okay, now you're tripping.
You enjoy, I'm going back to the party.

91
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:31,769
Yeah, you go ahead, I'm gonna chill
right here. What's up, sweetie?

92
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,607
- Where's the trainee?
- With his fine self.

93
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,394
- Byron?
- We were just trying to meet him.

94
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,681
Can I help you?

95
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,851
We were hoping that
maybe we could meet him.

96
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:43,185
- Together.
- Okay, well...

97
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,817
...you ladies look like
you have a lot of potential.

98
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,281
Why don't you step into my office
and let me look over your credentials?

99
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,991
Oh, I don't know.

100
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,151
Did I mention
Byron's my best friend?

101
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:56,899
The things I could do for you, baby.

102
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,869
Hey, man, I'm about
to make my speech...

103
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,332
...so I need my best friend to...

104
00:07:12,504 --> 00:07:14,081
What's wrong with you?

105
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,163
What?

106
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:20,831
I love you, man.

107
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,128
All right, all right, yeah, I love you too.
Now, come on. All right?

108
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,342
You the fucking trainee, man.

109
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:33,638
Thanks. Man, I really don't know
what to say.

110
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,974
You know, I'm not used to
being the centre of attention.

111
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:40,594
I just wanna thank
each and every one of you...

112
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:42,431
...for voting for me, you know?

113
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,522
This is a dream come true.

114
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:50,102
And I'd like to give
an extra-special thanks...

115
00:07:50,277 --> 00:07:52,399
...to my baby, Tiffany.

116
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,894
You made this dream a reality.

117
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,314
I love you, baby.

118
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:03,448
And last, but definitely not least...

119
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:06,534
...I want to thank
Dexter McKinzie's project manager...

120
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,446
...Ms. Carla Hilliard.

121
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:12,452
She held my hand
through this entire process.

122
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,615
Thanks, boss.

123
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,914
And enjoy the rest of the party.

124
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,337
Carla, what are you doing in here?

125
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:42,427
Hey, Byron. I was hoping I could
have you to myself for a minute.

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,631
Excuse me?

127
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:47,887
I think we need to spend some
alone time together, don't you?

128
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,638
Well, l...

129
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,638
To talk.

130
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:55,354
To talk. Yeah, we definitely
need some time to talk.

131
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:59,141
I mean, Mr. McKinzie didn't send me
down here to have a good time.

132
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:01,559
We've got a lot of work to do...

133
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:07,190
...and we're going to be spending
quite a bit of time together.

134
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:09,813
- Hey.
- Yes?

135
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:14,402
- Have you seen Byron?
- I did, over near the bathroom...

136
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:16,865
...but that was a while ago.
- Okay.

137
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:19,112
- Okay.
- Thanks.

138
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,529
I mean, you have gorgeous eyes,
but no, I'm taken.

139
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:22,986
Come on.

140
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,825
It seems that way.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,668
You think you're up for the task?

142
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,699
Byron, hello?

143
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,420
Tiff...

144
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:36,412
Tiff...

145
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,080
Tiff, it's... It's...

146
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,590
Excuse me.

147
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:52,505
Tiffany?

148
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,636
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

149
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,304
Are you sure?

150
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:58,806
No.

151
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm coming in, okay?

152
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:02,230
Okay.

153
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,848
Oh, my God, Tiffany.

154
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,607
Come on,
you're going to be all right.

155
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,816
- No.
- Calm down, calm down.

156
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,485
No, I don't wanna calm down.
You don't understand.

157
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:21,363
It hurts. It hurts so much that
I just want to break something.

158
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:23,858
No, give me.

159
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:29,030
Tiffany, breaking your nails
is not gonna help the situation.

160
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,327
Now, come on. You know what?

161
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:34,202
I want you to come to dinner
at my house tonight.

162
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,540
- Okay? So we can discuss this.
- No. No, I'll be fine.

163
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,751
No, don't be silly. Come on.

164
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,667
And I think it's about time
you meet my Dale.

165
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:46,835
Yeah, come on,
let's get you cleaned up.

166
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:50,332
What you gonna do?
You gonna spank that booty.

167
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,003
Spank that? You gonna spank it?

168
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,003
I might bite the thing, bite the thing.

169
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:58,044
Remember Denzel said,
"Mo' better makes it mo' better"?

170
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,594
Tiffany.

171
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:06,850
You are going to get through this.
You are. Be strong.

172
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,807
Yeah, I know. I know.

173
00:11:09,979 --> 00:11:11,521
Yeah, see? Lt'll be okay.

174
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:14,179
There's always a few bumps
in the road, right, baby?

175
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:17,097
You're right. Love has acne.

176
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:21,274
- I'm gonna check on dessert.
- Thank you.

177
00:11:21,445 --> 00:11:23,520
- You're welcome.
- That was good.

178
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:25,730
So did you cook it?

179
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:28,230
No, I didn't cook. He cooks.

180
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,280
- He cooks?
- He did that, yes.

181
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,533
He's cooking in the kitchen,
he's cooking in the bedroom...

182
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:35,741
...it's just...
- Slow it down. Okay, thanks.

183
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,820
Okay.

184
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:39,996
Perfect.

185
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:44,782
- Anything else I can...? Y'all straight?
- No, thank you.

186
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,828
- What about you, babe?
- We're fine. We're fine.

187
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:49,496
Oh, gosh.

188
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,290
- Oh, please, allow me.
- Thank you, baby.

189
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,870
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,585
Here you go, yes.

191
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,417
Yes.

192
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:01,332
And as a matter of fact...

193
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,426
...I just took the turkey out
the freezer for taco Tuesday.

194
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,920
Taco Tuesday.

195
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:10,013
I'm talking about the girl
who's all kind of freaky stuff.

196
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:13,217
- As a matter of fact, you know what?
- What's that?

197
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:16,013
- Kiss that one.
- Now the left side.

198
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:20,264
Even better on the right. I'm going
to go upstairs and start your bath.

199
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,726
Rose petals, scented candles,
the way you like it.

200
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:23,929
- All right?
- Thank you.

201
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:27,521
- Tiffany, nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

202
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,858
- I'll see you in a minute.
- All right, baby.

203
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:34,104
- Good.
- All right.

204
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:40,110
Where did you find him again?

205
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:43,651
- Girl, I didn't find him. I made him.
- You made him?

206
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,866
You know how they say
every man is a dog?

207
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,443
Well, it's true, they are.

208
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:51,194
You just need to make sure
you have a loyal one.

209
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:52,452
That's the trick.

210
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:56,205
Yeah, but I feel so stupid,
I didn't even know Byron was a dog.

211
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,493
Girl, a man being a dog
is a man being a man.

212
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,414
And a man is a dog,
and a dog can be trained.

213
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,672
Come here,
I have to show you something.

214
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:12,712
Okay, with you that excited,
it better be porn.

215
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:15,423
Great, great.

216
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:26,393
Let me tell you something.

217
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:28,434
I used to be off the hook, okay...

218
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:31,058
...doing my thing every day,
you know what I'm saying?

219
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,854
Yes, I did, you know.

220
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:34,682
But then Shante came in.

221
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,727
Watching the game and hanging
with my boys was important.

222
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,849
Cooking? Cleaning? Breast-feeding?
That's women's work.

223
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,316
No matter how old you get
the games never stop.

224
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:46,895
- We used to fight about everything.
- Everything.

225
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,353
Who's gonna drive.

226
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:50,904
- Where do you squeeze the toothpaste?
- Top or bottom?

227
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:53,363
- How do you have sex?
- Top or bottom?

228
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,278
Different toilet, same sh...

229
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,160
Until I called Shante Smith.

230
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,329
We don't argue over anything
anymore since we talked to Shante.

231
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,873
There you go.

232
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,373
- I understand what a woman is about.
- She straightened me right on out.

233
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,833
Definitely saved our marriage.

234
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,753
- I'm the one that needed to change.
- I'm so glad you did.

235
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:13,375
- My wife is gonna love this.
- I enjoy spending time...

236
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:16,500
...with my baby
and going shoe-shopping.

237
00:14:16,674 --> 00:14:19,129
- Thanks, Shante.
- Thank you, Shante.

238
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:20,581
For loving a white boy.

239
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,669
Having problems
with your relationship?

240
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,671
Can't get your man to commit?

241
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,220
Get along with your family?

242
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:28,012
Or even pick up the laundry?

243
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:29,295
Whatever.

244
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:32,307
Women, you have a lot of power
in relationships...

245
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:34,930
...but often,
you just don't know how to use it.

246
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm Shante Smith.

247
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:41,103
Call me and let me show you
how to work what you've got.

248
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:44,433
- Damn.
- Shante Smith.

249
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:48,935
- Yes.
- Shante, you look so beautiful.

250
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,857
Thank you for squeezing my friend in,
it's like a Christmas present for her...

251
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:56,029
...because you helped me
and my relationship.

252
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,735
Dale and I are like,
crazy in love, we have sex...

253
00:14:58,908 --> 00:15:01,777
You're very welcome, Linda.

254
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,610
- You remember my name?
- Of course.

255
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:07,027
You were one of my favourites.

256
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:12,912
- Okay, right this way.
- All right.

257
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:16,663
So where is she?

258
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:18,708
Right in her office.

259
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,669
Hold this.

260
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:32,628
I'm Shante Smith.

261
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:34,213
You're Tiffany, right?

262
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,711
Oh, I've heard so much about you.

263
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:39,461
- It's so nice to meet you.
- You too.

264
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,759
Well, how you doing?

265
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,221
I'm...

266
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:47,267
l...

267
00:15:49,063 --> 00:15:50,437
l... I can't take it.

268
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,558
Oh, no, no, no, hold on,
it's gonna be all right.

269
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:56,981
All right, come on now,
come on, girl, now breathe.

270
00:15:57,151 --> 00:16:00,067
- Breathe.
- I'm gonna breathe.

271
00:16:00,236 --> 00:16:01,813
I'm gonna breathe.

272
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:05,070
I can't breathe, I can't breathe.

273
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,527
Women have a tendency of dating
the same guy...

274
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,485
...over and over again.
- I'm gone.

275
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,698
- I'm out of here.
- Holler, bitch.

276
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:16,034
Behavioural scientists
would call it residual behaviour...

277
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:18,907
...but I call it
just being stuck on stupid.

278
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,077
It's okay. It's okay.

279
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:26,913
You don't understand.

280
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,417
I never thought a guy as sweet
as my Byron could cheat on me.

281
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:31,998
Oh, believe me, honey.

282
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:34,128
If they can cheat, they will.

283
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:36,586
But he has to work with her
every day.

284
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:40,754
Oh, Lord, don't pass out on me now.
Wait, wait, have a seat, have a seat.

285
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:44,010
All right, now, look, just because men
are more likely to cheat...

286
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,965
...doesn't mean that
they can't be faithful.

287
00:16:47,848 --> 00:16:52,259
Now, they can be,
but under the right conditions.

288
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:54,390
Before you can conquer the beast...

289
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,386
...you must first understand
the nature of the beast.

290
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:04,936
- Gizzy, you even listening to me?
- Yeah.

291
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,776
- Then what should I do?
- Relax.

292
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,725
How am I supposed to relax, all right?
She caught me with Carla.

293
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:16,438
- That sexy-ass project manager?
- Yeah.

294
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,772
- And you mad?
- Giz.

295
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,033
Hey, man, panicking never works.

296
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,988
That's true. Tell me,
what should I do? Send her flowers?

297
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:29,035
- Dinner. Bed and breakfast.
- No.

298
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:30,445
No, what?

299
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,240
No, you're not gonna send flowers
or any of that.

300
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,749
Save that for when you really mess up,
like forgetting her birthday.

301
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,287
For now we do nothing.

302
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:44,789
Give me that.

303
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:46,791
Do you understand
what I am telling you?

304
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,291
She caught me hugged up
with Carla.

305
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,175
You don't think
I should do something?

306
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:53,003
I didn't say do nothing.

307
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:55,799
I said for now we do nothing.

308
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:58,047
Let her make the first move...

309
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:00,594
...then we make our play.

310
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:03,885
- But what if she doesn't make a move?
- Oh, she'll make a move.

311
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,810
Trust me, there will be
a response for this.

312
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,594
How severe,
now, that's the question.

313
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,731
Okay, see, now you're starting
to make me afraid.

314
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,224
Oh, be afraid.

315
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,265
Be very afraid.

316
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,439
Don't be afraid.

317
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:26,894
You gotta punish his ass.

318
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,528
Smack that thing just like that,
I promise you.

319
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,158
Punish him.

320
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:32,405
So, what did Shante say?

321
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,734
Tiffany, I have a plan.

322
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,448
If you really want your man back...

323
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:40,740
...have a face to face with him...

324
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:44,615
...and give him
a chance to come clean.

325
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,668
Hi, I just wanted to talk to you
about what happened.

326
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,627
- Sure.
- Great.

327
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,831
Come on in.

328
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:57,340
Always sit down.

329
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:58,836
It's a power position.

330
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,792
It keeps you in control,
and puts him at ease...

331
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,338
...and that's exactly where
we want him to be.

332
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:08,007
At ease.

333
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,302
Okay, tell me everything.

334
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,882
Well, you know,
we talked a little bit, and...

335
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,680
You talked a little bit?
Did you hear what I just said?

336
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,011
Tell me... I need to know
every single detail.

337
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,014
What did she have on,
was the hoots out?

338
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,932
She eat something?
She wash her hands?

339
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,478
- Did she sit down?
- Well, yeah, she sat down.

340
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,223
- Okay, see, that's important.
- What?

341
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,943
Come on, she sat down, so what?

342
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:33,313
Dog, that's body language. Body
language speaks volumes, okay?

343
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:36,108
There's weak body language,
strong body language.

344
00:19:36,281 --> 00:19:39,400
Sitting down means she's comfortable.
She's assuming control.

345
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:42,030
She's calm and she sat down,
that means she's at home.

346
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:44,324
You might as well
give her your keys.

347
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,824
But she's got keys,
my place is like her home.

348
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:50,245
No, not home physically, mentally.

349
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:52,407
She's about to
take your ass to war...

350
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,116
...sitting down means
war ain't nothing but a thing to her.

351
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,710
- Do you love her?
- No.

352
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,168
No, baby, I love only you.

353
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,790
If you loved only me, you wouldn't
be messing around with that whore.

354
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,635
- Why she got to be a whore?
- Are you defending the whore?

355
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,794
- No.
- It sounds like you're defending her.

356
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,926
- I'm not.
- Why do you care if I call her...

357
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:17,468
...what she is? A whore.
- I don't care.

358
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,592
- Okay, Byron, then call her a whore.
- What?

359
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,805
Call her a whore.

360
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:27,221
Okay. You know, she's a... She's a...

361
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,761
- A whore.
- That's right, a whore.

362
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,061
Why are you getting
all emotional about this?

363
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,556
- I am not getting emotional.
- I hate to admit it...

364
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,232
...but women do get a tad bit irrational
when emotions are high.

365
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:43,315
But you must not, and I mean never,
lose control.

366
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,895
Byron! I'm not getting emotional.

367
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:49,781
- Okay.
- What else happened with the whore?

368
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,907
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

369
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:54,614
- Nothing. Nothing.
- Nothing? Nothing?

370
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,822
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- You're lying, tell me the truth.

371
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:01,447
Absolute truth: I was in the bathroom,
the women's bathroom was full...

372
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:05,834
You are such a liar! God!

373
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:12,125
One thing I ask you about.
One thing. Just one.

374
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,166
That went well.

375
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,838
- That's it?
- No, no, no, there's more.

376
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,801
Then she sits in the car for a half-hour
talking to somebody on the phone.

377
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,507
You went there, gave him
a piece of your mind anyway.

378
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,257
- But he is such a liar.
- Okay, no problem, not tripping.

379
00:21:30,766 --> 00:21:33,221
The real question is,
do you want him back?

380
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,014
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

381
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:38,344
- Yes.
- And you want that ring?

382
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:41,770
- Yes.
- Okay.

383
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,603
Then I guess we put him
on the Five Step Programme.

384
00:21:47,526 --> 00:21:50,443
From now on, you must do everything
that I tell you to do.

385
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:53,481
No deviation. Agreed?

386
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:57,604
- Okay.
- All right. Step one.

387
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:03,944
- Then she pulled off.
- She left?

388
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,241
Okay, she's gotta be
getting help from her girls.

389
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:11,034
No worries. You got me.

390
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,952
Right.

391
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,119
Hey, you're back.
Listen, I didn't wanna leave things...

392
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,620
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?
You wanna eat?

393
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,794
- Sure.
- Good, I got some groceries in the car.

394
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:26,625
You wanna get them for me?
Thank you.

395
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,010
- She bought you groceries?
- Yeah.

396
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:37,007
Can you believe it? She actually
started to cook me dinner.

397
00:22:39,432 --> 00:22:42,302
- Okay, this is weird.
- I know, right?

398
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:46,100
No, but wait, it gets worse.
Because check this out.

399
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:52,186
I go in the kitchen,
and the strangest thing happened.

400
00:22:57,818 --> 00:22:59,941
Excuse me, I have to
get the spoon to...

401
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:03,861
...stir the pasta.

402
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:07,104
Gotta stir that pasta.

403
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,996
Oh, dear, I'm sorry,
did you make a noise?

404
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:22,162
Just gonna get the spoon
for the pasta.

405
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,622
Whoa, what are you doing?

406
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:27,746
Just getting the spoon for the pasta.

407
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,160
- Oh, baby, what are you doing?
- I'm doing what I think you like, right?

408
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,415
You do like this, right?

409
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:39,041
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And do you like that?

410
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,881
How about that?

411
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:45,926
Want some more?

412
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:50,342
More of this?
Well, you can't have any more.

413
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,184
It was too good to be true.

414
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:57,051
Just like it's too good to be true
that you could be faithful to me.

415
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:04,642
Oh, I know. You like hot,
sleazy businesswomen that...

416
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:09,856
...act sophisticated, but really
are closeted freaks, don't you?

417
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:12,361
Yeah.

418
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,771
I mean, no. Come on, Tiffany.

419
00:24:14,948 --> 00:24:19,074
Look, we both got a lot of frustration,
let's just go upstairs and work it out.

420
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:22,657
Really? Okay, let's do it.

421
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:25,780
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What, what, what?

422
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:27,531
Okay, come on.

423
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,330
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What, what, what?

424
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,783
- You forgot this.
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:38,704
Oh, my God, jealous sex!
You had jealous sex with her.

426
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:41,250
- Let me finish my story first.
- Go right ahead.

427
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:47,963
My pants, my pants.
Help me get the pants off.

428
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,842
All right, you got them?

429
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:53,046
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What? What?

430
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:55,296
I can't sleep with you.
You're on punishment.

431
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:58,922
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're not sorry yet, but you will be.

432
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,549
- What?
- I'm joking, I'm joking.

433
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,432
Oh, God, I love you.

434
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:09,852
No, no, no. I love you.

435
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:13,769
And I really... I really am sorry.

436
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:17,558
- Please forgive me?
- I forgive you.

437
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:20,937
- She forgave you?
- Yeah, she forgave me.

438
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:24,527
- Just like that?
- Just like that. Come on.

439
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:27,567
Get out of here, you stupid dummy,
she ain't forgive you.

440
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:30,362
- Well, how do you know?
- Have you been punished?

441
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:33,526
- No.
- Well, then she ain't forgive you.

442
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:37,830
Forgiveness comes after, not before,
after they've gotten total satisfaction.

443
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,075
Continue.

444
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:47,167
Wait, all right, you know what?
L... I can't do this.

445
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:50,206
Honey, I forgive you, but I have
some things to work out.

446
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,878
And we will work them out.
Come on, we gotta finish this first.

447
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:58,175
No, I gotta go, sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:03,095
Talk amongst yourselves.

449
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:06,630
Fact: When a man gets an erection,
he can't think straight.

450
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:10,090
The blood rushes straight from
the big head down to the little head.

451
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:13,432
Now, you can use this
to your advantage. Why?

452
00:26:13,602 --> 00:26:17,728
When the little head gets worked up,
the big head drops its defences.

453
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:21,844
And now it is time for you
to play the big joker.

454
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,062
The hell with diamonds...

455
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,770
...blue balls are a girl's best friend.

456
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:29,433
Blue balls, blue balls, blue balls

457
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:34,022
Blue balls, blue balls,
Blue balls, blue balls

458
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:38,403
So, what did Shante
tell you to do next?

459
00:26:39,784 --> 00:26:42,405
- No, I can't.
- You only think you wanna leave.

460
00:26:42,578 --> 00:26:44,616
- You really wanna stay. Now, come on.
- No...

461
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:47,787
...and I think we should
go to counselling.

462
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,492
Counselling? So how you gonna
play it when you go?

463
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,623
What you mean, "when I go"?
I'm not going.

464
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:56,666
- You gotta go.
- I don't gotta do anything.

465
00:26:56,836 --> 00:26:59,622
She forgave me.
Or at least she wants to forgive me.

466
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:03,460
Okay, so she's mad. Maybe I gotta
jump through hoops, but counselling?

467
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:06,252
Let some shrink bring up
indiscretions from my childhood.

468
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,460
Tell me it's weird Uncle Jack
dressed me in an Easter bunny outfit.

469
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:12,801
- And made me promise not to tell.
- Wait, hold up, hold up.

470
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:14,001
What?

471
00:27:15,222 --> 00:27:16,965
Never mind.
The point is I ain't going.

472
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,930
Yes, you are. I got news for you:

473
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,589
She's going to that session
with or without you.

474
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:24,933
You gotta go to counselling to see
what she's got planned against you.

475
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,680
Or even worse,
planned without you.

476
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,806
Well...

477
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,811
...Tiffany's already hipped me to
a little bit of what's been going on.

478
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:35,354
But what's the real problem?

479
00:27:35,901 --> 00:27:37,359
Problem?

480
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:41,774
You see, I don't think that there is
any real problem. It's...

481
00:27:41,946 --> 00:27:43,855
No, I admit that
I did something stupid...

482
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:46,106
...and got caught
in a compromising position.

483
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:49,824
Which I feel terrible about. But...

484
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:53,694
My heart and soul lies with her.

485
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,368
And only her. You know, I just want us
to get through this.

486
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:01,160
You want to get through what?

487
00:28:03,459 --> 00:28:06,661
This. This thing, this incident.

488
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:09,291
You know, I want our relationship
to move on.

489
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,995
Move on to what?

490
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,460
Yeah, Byron, move on to what?

491
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:18,130
Move on beyond this.

492
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:21,005
We have got to get over this,
because...

493
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:24,094
Well, Carla's my boss
to a certain extent.

494
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:26,302
We have to be together.

495
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,216
- Oh, really?
- Not together, together.

496
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:31,675
- That was a bad choice of words.
- I should get over it, it's that easy?

497
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:34,555
- That's not what I said.
- I have issues with the fact...

498
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:37,727
...that you're going to be working
side by side with that tramp.

499
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:39,853
- Okay...
- She's got a good point, Byron.

500
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:43,307
Ganging up on me. Now, look...

501
00:28:43,483 --> 00:28:45,890
...I messed up. And that makes it
difficult for you.

502
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:48,688
It's not like Carla and I will
spend much time together.

503
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:53,272
And what little time we do spend
is gonna be strictly...

504
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:55,902
...strictly work.
You always come first.

505
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:08,952
Oh, my... I gotta take this.

506
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,578
I'm sor... I'm so sorry. Yeah? Yeah?

507
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,585
- Okay.
- So...

508
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:24,832
...who was that?
- Who was that?

509
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:28,171
Nobody. What were you saying?

510
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,629
It was Carla. Speak of the devil.

511
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:41,801
Yeah, she wanted...

512
00:29:41,976 --> 00:29:45,225
We have to meet...

513
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:47,513
...this week, for...

514
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:50,053
...lunch.

515
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:54,229
Is it hot in here to you too?

516
00:29:57,902 --> 00:30:00,108
- Busted.
- Now you send flowers.

517
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,113
Yeah, because this thing
is all messed up now.

518
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,272
Well, yes and no.

519
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:08,401
I mean, on the one hand,
you got woman problems.

520
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:13,449
On the other hand,
you got a job with benefits.

521
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,570
Yeah, damn.

522
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:19,154
Yeah, I think Tiffany's gonna like this.

523
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,869
Maybe we'll take a yoga
or Pilates class together.

524
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,660
Okay, either you're gay or you're
thinking about marrying this woman.

525
00:30:26,836 --> 00:30:28,579
I'm not gay.

526
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:31,959
Maybe I am thinking about
marrying her. So what?

527
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:35,002
So what? Man, you can't get married
under these conditions.

528
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:36,834
What do you mean,
"these conditions"?

529
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:39,376
Never buckle to pressure
and get married.

530
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:41,343
Who said I was feeling pressure?

531
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,171
I'm not feeling pressure.

532
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:45,421
Because, in all honesty...

533
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:47,755
...l'm starting to think that...

534
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:49,805
...I don't know, maybe...

535
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,014
...settling down...

536
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,264
...wouldn't be too bad.

537
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:58,179
Settling down? Are you crazy?
Look around you, think for a minute.

538
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:02,607
Looked like a watermelon
in there, man.

539
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:06,942
This is not what I need
to hear right now.

540
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,936
- Hey, Byron.
- Carla, hi.

541
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:15,488
- Enjoying the facilities?
- Immensely, yes.

542
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:20,824
Well, Mr. McKinzie likes to make sure
all of his employees are looking good.

543
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:25,367
We wanted to give you a preview
of what's in store.

544
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:31,122
I won't bother you. Just remember
we're having lunch this week.

545
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:35,455
- It's in the books.
- I look forward to it.

546
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:40,537
- Me too.
- Damn. That woman is scrumptious.

547
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:43,583
I can only imagine the craziness
that's gonna take place.

548
00:31:43,757 --> 00:31:45,714
You are living every man's dream
right now.

549
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:47,258
Know how many women want you?

550
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:49,465
You know how many women
want me right now?

551
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,678
- Want you?
- You the trainee.

552
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:53,672
They'll settle for the next best thing.

553
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:56,597
- You're the next best thing?
- It's called "residual ass."

554
00:31:56,765 --> 00:32:00,927
If you settle down, my chick count
drops considerably. Then what?

555
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,517
Giz, this isn't about you.

556
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:06,176
I'm not gonna not get married
so you can get some.

557
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:08,346
I'm not saying not to get married.

558
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:11,012
I'm saying make sure
it's on your own terms.

559
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:14,816
You up. I'm done. See that?

560
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:17,142
Yeah, nice BB guns.

561
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,476
I'm gonna get apple butt.

562
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,942
If flowers don't work the first time,
what do you do?

563
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,447
You send more flowers. But this time,
send them to her job.

564
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:30,570
That's a class move.
All her co-work ers get to see them...

565
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:34,953
...and tell her how wonderful they are.
Better yet, how wonderful you are.

566
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:39,781
- Those flowers are just so wonderful.
- Those are wonderful.

567
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:45,082
- I wish a man sent me flowers.
- You guys are so not helping me.

568
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:48,916
No, no, no. Don't fall
for the first pump fake.

569
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:51,578
You got to make his ass
work a little harder.

570
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,246
If a man doesn't go through
anything with you...

571
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:56,167
...he won't appreciate you.

572
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,958
All right, I'll admit it:

573
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,626
Sending flowers to the job
was a pretty good move.

574
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:05,254
Nosy co-workers got nothing better
to do than be all up in your business.

575
00:33:05,431 --> 00:33:06,593
Getting you confused.

576
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:10,298
All that pressure on a sister
just makes her want to melt.

577
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:13,475
Don't do it, don't do it.

578
00:33:13,644 --> 00:33:15,470
Stay strong.

579
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:18,512
Don't fall for the common trap,
Tiffany.

580
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:20,728
- But they're so lovely.
- So what?

581
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,733
- Okay.
- Think of Carla. Carla.

582
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,066
With her dirty, money-hungry hands
all over your man.

583
00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:30,486
- Yeah, you're right.
- You're damn right I'm right.

584
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:34,733
All right, now you have
got to stay focused.

585
00:33:34,907 --> 00:33:37,278
Stay focused.

586
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,987
- You're right.
- Yeah.

587
00:33:41,036 --> 00:33:42,695
Trick-ass bitch.

588
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,915
Another one,
with the long straw, baby.

589
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:57,293
Who are you?

590
00:33:57,921 --> 00:34:01,123
Look, man, flowers, not working,
they're not working.

591
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:03,040
I know the flowers are not working.

592
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:06,002
Because she knows you owe her
more than flowers.

593
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:07,966
It's time to raise the ante.

594
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,755
- What's your pockets looking like?
- Pockets?

595
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:15,007
- Good. You gonna spend my money?
- Time to go shopping.

596
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:17,801
- I think I need to break up with my man.
- Mo.

597
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:20,215
I'm just saying, for real.

598
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,349
This is the real deal.

599
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,721
This ain't even from the flea market.
I'm saying, it's so fresh.

600
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,140
I just love it.

601
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,727
- Yup, that's real.
- Yeah.

602
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:34,059
I'm saying that purse is just so hot.

603
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:37,399
No, the whole set is hot.

604
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:42,443
I think I need to call him.
What's his number?

605
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:50,276
Hello? Hey, Tyrone, how you doing?
Everything's okay? Good. Good.

606
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:52,527
I wanna say, I don't fuck
with you no more.

607
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:54,944
Got a purse and everything.
I ain't got shit.

608
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:57,197
Your ass ain't never
gave me nothing...

609
00:34:57,373 --> 00:35:00,041
- Shante, I'm getting weak.
- Slow your roll.

610
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,164
Gifts just means
that he's panicking.

611
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,741
- It's time to move on to step two.
- Wait, hold on.

612
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,745
It means I get to keep
the gifts, right?

613
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,711
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

614
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,045
It's time for
Operation Isolate and Destroy.

615
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,919
- Operation who and what?
- Operation Isolate and Destroy.

616
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:21,928
- What is that?
- Well, it comes in two parts.

617
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:25,298
- First, you must meet his family.
- The family? No.

618
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:27,927
Well, you wanna know
what he's about, don't you?

619
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,888
Then you gotta see
where he's from.

620
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:34,178
See some baby pictures.
Check out that birth certificate.

621
00:35:34,353 --> 00:35:38,432
Are there any crazy traits that are
hereditary? You need to know that.

622
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:40,016
You're right about that.

623
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:45,265
Trust me, how a guy treats his mother
is exactly how he's going to treat you.

624
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,893
If he treats her badly,
don't expect any better.

625
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,739
- That's the truth.
- The primary goal...

626
00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:53,944
...of Operation Isolate and Destroy...

627
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:55,941
...is to cut off his social resources...

628
00:35:56,116 --> 00:35:58,820
...and for you to gain allies.
- The mother and the sister.

629
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:00,190
Exactly.

630
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,651
If he resists, don't get discouraged.

631
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:08,154
You just remind him
about that little indiscretion.

632
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,664
- It works every time.
- Every time.

633
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:15,161
You don't want me
to meet your parents?

634
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:17,375
- Of course I do.
- Why all the resistance?

635
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:19,336
- There is no resistance.
- Oh, I see.

636
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:23,129
So I gotta be a sexy project manager
to get a road trip.

637
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:25,255
- Tiffany, let's not do this.
- Why?

638
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:28,046
You don't want to talk about her,
want me to just forget?

639
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,969
I can't, Byron, I can't.
Because the image of you and her...

640
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:32,512
...is seared into my mind.

641
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,304
- Come on, Tiffany.
- Seared.

642
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,381
Like the day you forgot my birthday.

643
00:36:36,557 --> 00:36:40,007
Or the day I called you with a flat tyre,
and you were "at the doctor."

644
00:36:40,184 --> 00:36:42,010
- Were you really at the doctor?
- Yes.

645
00:36:42,185 --> 00:36:43,976
- Why, were you sick?
- Well...

646
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:47,014
Or got a little herpes action
you wanna talk to me about?

647
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:50,603
Herpes? No herpes. I told you,
I was allergic to chocolate.

648
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:54,058
I'm allergic to chocolate. And what
does that have to do with anything?

649
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:58,147
So you were just ignoring the fact that
I was in the rain, changing a tyre...

650
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,442
...while you were at
an imaginary hospital...

651
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:03,150
...getting shots for a venereal disease.
God, Byron.

652
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:05,813
How many women have
you been with before me anyway?

653
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:10,197
I don't understand the words
coming out of your mouth.

654
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:13,783
Why not?
Herpes damage your hearing?

655
00:37:13,954 --> 00:37:15,827
I'm never gonna be finished
with this car.

656
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:18,155
You gotta make sure
the chrome is just right.

657
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:21,248
You're paying more attention
to the car than me. I got problems.

658
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:22,745
Okay, she flipped out on you.

659
00:37:22,918 --> 00:37:24,661
- Yes.
- Continue.

660
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:27,871
You know, she started piling on stuff
that wasn't even connected.

661
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,370
Like the time I forgot
to tape Oprah. Oprah, dude.

662
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,710
Well, which Oprah was it?

663
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,169
The one where she and Gayle
drive cross-country.

664
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:38,836
- Tape that. Oprah was in Kentucky.
- I know, no makeup, no perm.

665
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:41,715
Okay, all this because
she wants to meet your family, huh?

666
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:44,010
- She got you on the fast track.
- I know.

667
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:47,429
- You sure she's marriage potential?
- Don't point that thing at me.

668
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,342
She's definitely marriage potential.

669
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,513
Well, then you gotta go Janet Jackson
on her. You gotta take control.

670
00:37:53,686 --> 00:37:56,721
- You down to pull out the big guns?
- Bigger the better. Talk to me.

671
00:37:56,897 --> 00:37:59,849
- Big gun number one.
- Number one.

672
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:02,148
Sleep with her.

673
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:03,691
That's easier said than done.

674
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:05,981
- She's doing the hold out, huh?
- She on strike.

675
00:38:06,152 --> 00:38:07,859
That's what women do, see?

676
00:38:08,028 --> 00:38:10,898
Because the longer a woman waits,
the more power she has.

677
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,941
Holding out, that's her ace.
She ain't gonna play that card.

678
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:16,688
- Okay.
- Controls her emotional floodgates.

679
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,859
And you need those gates
open and flowing.

680
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:21,323
- Open and flowing.
- Yes. Best way to do that...

681
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:23,202
...tap that ass.

682
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:25,991
- All right. You're sure about this?
- Oh, most definitely.

683
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,950
She wanna meet your parents?
Let her meet them. " Mama, Daddy.

684
00:38:29,124 --> 00:38:30,404
Everybody know each other?"

685
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,868
Just make sure she don't come back
in here without you turning her out.

686
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:36,997
- Can you handle that?
- Can I handle it? Come on, baby.

687
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:38,368
- I'm the trainee.
- Can you?

688
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:42,329
- I'm Byron the trainee.
- Man, you're putting your hand...

689
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:44,748
Now I gotta start all over.

690
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,508
- Who owns that old squeegee?
- Me, brother.

691
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:51,214
- I'm gonna leave your ass.
- Never seen no car like this.

692
00:38:51,387 --> 00:38:54,720
You know what colour this is?
This is burnt sienna, brother.

693
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,846
Burnt sienna.

694
00:38:57,016 --> 00:39:00,051
When meeting the parents it's
important to mak e a good impression.

695
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,977
Mak e sure your mak eup
and attire are just right.

696
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:05,053
You don't wanna outshine Mom.

697
00:39:05,229 --> 00:39:07,766
But you definitely gotta
mak e Daddy smile.

698
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:10,855
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey there, boy.

699
00:39:11,024 --> 00:39:14,937
Hi, I'm Tiffany. Mrs. Thomson,
it's so nice to meet you.

700
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,778
Thank you, and welcome to
our fair state of Alabama.

701
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:20,980
Oh, thank you.
And you must be Karen?

702
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:23,112
- Hey.
- You're adorable.

703
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,404
- And you must be Byron's father.
- Nice to meet you.

704
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:31,702
Byron said you're a very attractive man,
but I'm glad I get to see it for myself.

705
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,948
Well, what can I say?
Fruit don't fall too far from the tree.

706
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:39,739
But you got some mighty
tight jeans on there, girl.

707
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,624
You must have painted them on.

708
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,072
- Ralph.
- What?

709
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:46,454
- Oh, don't mind him.
- Mom, Dad...

710
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:49,498
- Hey, darling.
- Good rain come along...

711
00:39:49,672 --> 00:39:51,545
...liable to wash them suckers
right off.

712
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:52,913
Ralph!

713
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,585
- Come on, darling.
- Okay.

714
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,632
Y'all go ahead. I'll get the bags.

715
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,378
Yo, Byron, Byron.

716
00:39:58,553 --> 00:40:00,924
- Yeah, Dad?
- Let me tell you something, son.

717
00:40:01,096 --> 00:40:02,886
One time.

718
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:05,886
Lord, please let it rain.

719
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:11,100
That's pretty good, boy. She's fine.
I like how she wear them jeans too.

720
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:13,141
What if they don't like me?

721
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,184
What do you mean,
if they don't like you?

722
00:40:15,354 --> 00:40:17,927
All you gotta do is be polite
and respectful of Byron...

723
00:40:18,106 --> 00:40:20,062
...and his mother and sister
will like you.

724
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:21,477
But what about the daddy?

725
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:23,143
Did you wear the jeans?

726
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:26,728
- Yes.
- Then he lik es you.

727
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:30,733
He just can't be too obvious
or he'll be needing my services too.

728
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:33,940
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
He's France.

729
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:35,988
Girl, you're the United States.

730
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:37,438
You don't need his v ote.

731
00:40:37,617 --> 00:40:41,151
Remember, you are down there
to get the support of the women.

732
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:43,495
Okay.

733
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:47,579
So when is it
you start your new job?

734
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:49,539
Well, I leave for Seattle in October.

735
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:53,455
Boy, why you still jumping over hoops
over a game show?

736
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,785
Well, it's more than just a show,
Dad.

737
00:40:55,962 --> 00:40:57,788
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

738
00:40:57,963 --> 00:41:01,745
Really, and I never would have won
if it hadn't been for Tiffany.

739
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:04,753
Girl, you turned him
on to that mess?

740
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:07,594
I encouraged him to do the show,
if that's what you mean.

741
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,970
Got his head all twisted up.
Got the boy thinking he's a city boy.

742
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,628
You know,
you ain't nothing but trouble.

743
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,214
Daddy,
I think Byron's winning is cool.

744
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,178
Everybody's talking about it.
And I like his new look.

745
00:41:21,352 --> 00:41:23,095
I like it too, Ralph.

746
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,308
He looks hip.

747
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,807
Did you do that too?

748
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,439
Well, you know, new haircut,
got rid of the glasses, hip for TV.

749
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:33,814
Hip, tip, double flip, who cares?

750
00:41:33,984 --> 00:41:35,063
You know what you need?

751
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:38,611
You need some discipline.

752
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:45,233
Well, it was a really great meal,
Mrs. Thomson.

753
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:48,076
- Can I help you with the dishes?
- No, I got it. You relax.

754
00:41:48,243 --> 00:41:49,820
Help her, baby. Let her help you.

755
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:52,484
Let's see if the girl
knows how to get her hands dirty.

756
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:55,069
Yes. Let me help you.

757
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,120
- Thank you, baby.
- No problem.

758
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,830
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Oh, shit, I'm only messing with her.

759
00:42:04,002 --> 00:42:06,623
Okay, I am officially freaking out.

760
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:12,995
Don't panic. You're doing fine.
The worst is almost over, Tiffany.

761
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:14,967
Okay.

762
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:17,881
She is so nice. I really like her.

763
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,380
- Me too.
- Me too.

764
00:42:19,553 --> 00:42:21,296
I mean, I could take or leave her.

765
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:24,673
- So you guys really like her, huh?
- She's really cool.

766
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:26,093
And she's gorgeous.

767
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:28,174
She's all right.

768
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,018
Look, can we break it up before
she comes back? Come on.

769
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:34,680
- You're supposed to help me.
- What?

770
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:37,688
I'm helping you, boy.
You need to listen to your dad.

771
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:52,730
- It's the Giz.
- Giz, yo. They love her, man.

772
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:55,523
That's cool. They're supposed to.

773
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,573
Just remember
what you're supposed to do.

774
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,577
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got this.
- Okay?

775
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,322
Oh, yeah.

776
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,444
Okay. Now, remember. There's a time
and a place for everything.

777
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,374
There's a time to hit it
and there's a time for a quickie.

778
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:12,032
Tonight, you making love.

779
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,909
- Okay?
- Okay. Love machine.

780
00:43:23,883 --> 00:43:25,959
Pummel, pummel, pummel.
Come on, let's go.

781
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:27,545
You mother...

782
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:39,048
What?

783
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:41,597
Let's pretend
like we're in high school.

784
00:43:43,312 --> 00:43:44,342
No.

785
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,271
Your parents are right next door.

786
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:48,719
They're asleep.

787
00:43:48,898 --> 00:43:51,353
They are not thinking about us.

788
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,817
Oh, they're asleep, huh?

789
00:44:05,992 --> 00:44:07,735
Things have changed
since I moved out.

790
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,534
That's disgusting.

791
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:12,987
Look, either way, they're not
thinking about us. All right?

792
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,988
I knew he might try and pull a fast one,
so I prepared a rebuttal.

793
00:44:21,168 --> 00:44:23,918
It's an old trick,
but it works every time.

794
00:44:24,086 --> 00:44:29,161
Now, if it doesn't work, you might
want to reevaluate your man.

795
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:37,541
No, no, no.

796
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:40,339
- Wait, wait, wait. I can't do it. I can't.
- Yes, you can.

797
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:41,757
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

798
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,547
- Because. Our little friend is in town.
- Because why?

799
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,261
What little friend?
Ain't nobody come to visit.

800
00:44:48,892 --> 00:44:51,429
Our little friend...

801
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:53,511
...is in town.

802
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:57,723
No, I don't wanna say hello
to your little friend.

803
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,973
I know, that's the point.

804
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:02,850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

805
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,318
Good night.

806
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:07,442
Come on, let's cuddle. We'll cuddle.

807
00:45:08,112 --> 00:45:12,191
What? Like I'm the only woman
who's used that trick before.

808
00:45:22,454 --> 00:45:25,573
Now, why did you bring so much
for overnight, son?

809
00:45:25,748 --> 00:45:28,119
Pop, talk to that one.

810
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:31,370
- It was so nice to meet you.
- Thank you for having me.

811
00:45:31,543 --> 00:45:34,543
Oh, you're so welcome, darling.

812
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:37,497
- Don't forget about me.
- Never.

813
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:40,623
Oh, come here.

814
00:45:40,798 --> 00:45:42,671
Give me a hug.
Put your arms around me.

815
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:43,955
There you go.

816
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:46,375
What did you say
was the quickest way to Atlanta?

817
00:45:46,552 --> 00:45:49,386
- That's right.
- I'm just joking.

818
00:45:49,804 --> 00:45:52,294
Now, remember, honey.
You are always welcomed here.

819
00:45:52,472 --> 00:45:53,752
You're family now.

820
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:57,263
Thank you. You hear that?
I'm family now.

821
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:58,808
Yeah.

822
00:45:58,976 --> 00:46:00,802
You're family now.

823
00:46:01,436 --> 00:46:03,392
- Time to get back in the house.
- All right.

824
00:46:03,562 --> 00:46:05,969
You need to take them shorts off.
They're too short.

825
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:08,103
You ain't going nowhere with that.

826
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:09,435
So how did it go?

827
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,315
She's a big hit with the family.

828
00:46:11,483 --> 00:46:13,392
Yeah, who cares? Did you hit it?

829
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:15,607
Come on, man. Did I hit...?

830
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:18,019
- No.
- No?

831
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:20,816
How you come back empty-handed?
That was the whole point.

832
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:23,360
I couldn't. You know,
she was on her, you know...

833
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:24,990
Oh, you did not fall for that.

834
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:26,652
What choice did I have?

835
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,742
That's a strategic move. Women
always say that when they're not.

836
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:32,697
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna
force the issue, okay?

837
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,868
Yeah, I guess you got a point there.

838
00:46:36,957 --> 00:46:38,616
Hey, you wanna stay for dinner?

839
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:40,250
Fresh box of Corn Flakes, baby.

840
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:44,164
Word. You know, you and me,
we gotta talk about tomorrow.

841
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:47,502
I've heard about this place.
Never had an opportunity to eat here.

842
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:50,458
I've never been here before.

843
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:53,169
- It's kind of cute.
- It was a good choice.

844
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:56,674
- You really look handsome today.
- Thank you.

845
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,547
Just fans, you know?
They're everywhere. Of the show.

846
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:02,627
- Well, isn't that great?
- Yeah.

847
00:47:02,806 --> 00:47:05,474
Okay, well, I have some good news
and not-so-good news.

848
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:07,265
Which would you like to hear first?

849
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,888
My mama always said,
"Start with the bad news."

850
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:11,977
Okay, I'll start with the good.

851
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:14,635
The good news is
is we've gotten more phone calls...

852
00:47:14,813 --> 00:47:18,180
...about this year's Trainee
than every other season combined.

853
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:22,483
More phone calls
than every other season combined?

854
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:26,433
And every talk show in America
wants you on as a guest.

855
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:29,066
I'm talking Leno to Oprah.

856
00:47:29,238 --> 00:47:31,526
Oprah? I'm gonna be on Oprah!

857
00:47:31,698 --> 00:47:33,026
- Everybody.
- Yes.

858
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,364
- I'm just saying it to the world.
- It's exciting. Enjoy it.

859
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:39,035
So here's the bad news.

860
00:47:39,202 --> 00:47:42,072
The bad news is
in order to fit this into your schedule...

861
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:45,448
...we've got to get you on the road
this month instead of October.

862
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:47,029
- What?
- What?

863
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:49,531
- What?
- I mean, by the end of this month?

864
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:52,874
Yeah, that's the only way
to make it work. Is that okay?

865
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:55,748
Is that okay?

866
00:47:56,588 --> 00:47:59,541
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
It's just gonna be tough for Tiffany...

867
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:01,623
...to up and leave
on such short notice.

868
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:05,167
- Tiffany?
- Yeah, Tiffany, my...

869
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:08,842
There's flies in this place.

870
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:11,253
Well, you picked the place.

871
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,671
Yeah, Tiffany's my...

872
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:16,473
My girlfriend.

873
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:18,218
Yeah.

874
00:48:18,392 --> 00:48:20,468
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

875
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:22,966
- About what?
- Tiffany.

876
00:48:24,396 --> 00:48:26,886
First, I realise
that this may sound a little funny...

877
00:48:27,064 --> 00:48:30,562
...coming from me,
due to our little incident.

878
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,306
See, that was personal.
This is business.

879
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:35,358
To be perfectly honest...

880
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:40,733
...l'm not sure if Tiffany
is the right move for you right now.

881
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:44,404
What do you mean,
Tiffany's not the right move for me?

882
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:46,568
I've seen this a thousand times.

883
00:48:46,743 --> 00:48:50,442
Small-time guy has a small-time girl
and everything is fine.

884
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,988
Then the guy hits the big time
and she can't keep up.

885
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,535
She doesn't understand
why things have to change.

886
00:48:57,082 --> 00:48:58,908
Why you have to be on the road.

887
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:02,202
Why your meetings are more
important than spending time with her.

888
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:05,827
Why you are invited to parties
and she can't come.

889
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:09,293
No, Tiffany wouldn't be jealous
of my work, all right?

890
00:49:09,465 --> 00:49:11,587
She's not like that.

891
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:13,548
They're all like that.

892
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:18,424
And see, you don't need someone
that's gonna hold you back.

893
00:49:18,595 --> 00:49:21,050
You need a woman that's gonna
help you move forward.

894
00:49:22,722 --> 00:49:23,753
And she does that.

895
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:27,299
I mean, she's the one who got me
in the game in the first place.

896
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:30,096
She got you in the game...

897
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:34,217
...but baby, I am the game.

898
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:37,811
You do right by me
and you'll be flying so high...

899
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:40,602
...your feet will never
touch the ground.

900
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:45,057
And exactly how does one...

901
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:49,188
...do right by you?

902
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,615
We'll leave that up to interpretation.

903
00:49:57,785 --> 00:49:59,030
Oh, shit.

904
00:50:02,163 --> 00:50:04,071
I gotta run.

905
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:05,907
Enjoy lunch.

906
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:08,204
I'll be in touch.

907
00:50:14,295 --> 00:50:15,954
What the hell's wrong with you,
man?

908
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:18,287
What the hell is wrong with you?

909
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:22,463
Now that you met the family
and secured your allies... Good girl.

910
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:26,878
- It's time to kick in part two
of Operation Isolate and Destroy.

911
00:50:27,053 --> 00:50:29,756
By now I'm sure he's getting advice
from his best friend...

912
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:32,051
...who probably doesn't even
have a girlfriend.

913
00:50:32,222 --> 00:50:35,056
You must disrupt the communication
between him and his boy.

914
00:50:35,224 --> 00:50:37,050
But you're gonna need
some outside help.

915
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:41,008
- Well, what kind of outside help?
- Candy Alexander.

916
00:50:41,186 --> 00:50:42,644
Street psychologist.

917
00:50:42,812 --> 00:50:44,555
Oh, so she's a real psychologist?

918
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,306
Well, she is street
and she's a head doctor.

919
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,057
Girl, there's not a man alive
that can resist her.

920
00:50:58,321 --> 00:50:59,731
State Wide Express.

921
00:50:59,905 --> 00:51:01,981
Don't you mean Federal Express?

922
00:51:02,157 --> 00:51:06,484
No, honey.
We only do state-wide deliveries, sir.

923
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:09,153
Dressed like that?

924
00:51:09,328 --> 00:51:12,945
Look, mister, I have a package for you.
Do you want it or not?

925
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:15,996
Hell, yeah.

926
00:51:16,165 --> 00:51:20,161
- Like that?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

927
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:21,793
Yeah.

928
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,991
Shut up, bitch.

929
00:51:23,169 --> 00:51:24,793
Once she shows up...

930
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:28,128
...Operation Isolate and Destroy
will be complete.

931
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,585
And we'll be ready for step three.

932
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,464
That was good.

933
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,596
You ready for round two?

934
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:46,674
You already know how I do it.

935
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,048
Yeah.

936
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:49,803
Oh, man.

937
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:52,183
Candy's gonna love this, man.
That right there.

938
00:51:52,353 --> 00:51:54,476
- How much?
- A hundred dollars for everything.

939
00:51:54,646 --> 00:51:55,974
Everything. Okay, cool.

940
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,223
- Here. Got puppies?
- No. Rottweilers and pits.

941
00:51:58,399 --> 00:52:01,731
- The block is hot. You gotta hurry up.
- Okay, I'll take this right here.

942
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:04,023
Pleasure doing business.
When did you get out?

943
00:52:04,194 --> 00:52:05,771
- Ten minutes ago.
- Yeah?

944
00:52:07,196 --> 00:52:08,820
The end of the month?

945
00:52:09,822 --> 00:52:13,071
Well, the 15-year anniversary issue
of the magazine is due this month.

946
00:52:13,241 --> 00:52:14,865
When had you planned
on telling me?

947
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:16,444
I'm telling you now.

948
00:52:16,618 --> 00:52:19,286
Well, how am I supposed to be ready
by then? I have a job.

949
00:52:19,453 --> 00:52:20,994
Can't you ask them for more time?

950
00:52:21,162 --> 00:52:23,320
It doesn't exactly
work like that, baby.

951
00:52:23,497 --> 00:52:25,204
Well, how does it work?

952
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:26,867
I mean, can't you just ask them?

953
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:28,831
Gotta know
you had a life before this.

954
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,992
Okay, okay, look.

955
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:35,875
Maybe I'll just go ahead and leave now
and you join me whenever.

956
00:52:36,046 --> 00:52:37,706
If you want to.

957
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:41,505
I'm sorry. What?

958
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:44,046
Look, I don't wanna go without you.

959
00:52:44,218 --> 00:52:47,881
But, you know,
it's just something to think about.

960
00:52:48,053 --> 00:52:51,836
Yeah, it is something to think about.

961
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:54,848
This is where step three
becomes mandatory.

962
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,262
Show him how quickly
you can move on if need be.

963
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:04,187
Because besides blue balls...

964
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,393
...fear is a girl's best friend.

965
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:09,730
Byron, eat your heart out.

966
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,226
Do I really look like that?

967
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,230
- Yeah.
- My head's really that big?

968
00:53:16,404 --> 00:53:20,898
Well, yeah, but I'm really glad
that you could make it out tonight.

969
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,651
Look at you. It's your night.

970
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,440
Well, you know, I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

971
00:53:25,617 --> 00:53:27,942
I'm glad you got the magazine
to support us.

972
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,035
- After what happened...
- You know what? Don't flatter yourself.

973
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:33,410
This was already in the works.
I gotta go.

974
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:36,865
- Tiff.
- Byron, have a good night.

975
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:40,658
Tiff, we need to...
Tiff, we need to talk. Seriously. Tiff.

976
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:42,708
Tiff, come on.

977
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,876
- Thank you.
- Hey, yo, Giz. Giz.

978
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:49,747
I've been looking all over for you.

979
00:53:49,924 --> 00:53:54,383
B, you gotta meet this girl
I met the other day.

980
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:57,255
Man, she just literally showed up
at my doorstep.

981
00:53:57,428 --> 00:53:59,799
I mean, literally showed up
at my doorstep like:

982
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,841
Great. Good. Great. But where
have you been the past few days?

983
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:05,931
I've been e-mailing you, calling you.
I need my consigliere.

984
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,139
Look at her.
She's got girls in each ear.

985
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,637
- No men here.
- They're here...

986
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,933
There's Byron. No.
He's looking over at you.

987
00:54:12,104 --> 00:54:13,727
- Okay, wait.
- Wow, yes. It is him.

988
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:17,595
- Can he see me?
- Hey, baby. I brought you a drink.

989
00:54:17,774 --> 00:54:19,267
Byron...

990
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:22,192
...this is Candy.
- Hey, Byron. Giz told me about you.

991
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,728
- What's up?
- I'm going back over to the girls, okay?

992
00:54:25,903 --> 00:54:27,148
I'll see you later.

993
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:33,735
What the hell's going on?
Is she the reason I can't reach you?

994
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:37,774
Bro, I think I'm in love.

995
00:54:37,952 --> 00:54:40,822
From now on,
the Gizzard's off the market.

996
00:54:40,996 --> 00:54:42,620
- I'm done.
- What?

997
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:44,780
I'm gonna make her
my numero uno.

998
00:54:44,956 --> 00:54:46,284
My number one. My ace.

999
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:50,039
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Nothing.

1000
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:53,791
It's like the first time in my life,
everything's right.

1001
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:58,005
I mean, all my life
it's like the air I breathed...

1002
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,501
...didn't even taste good.

1003
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:02,922
Now it's like God sprinkled a
little seasoning salt on my soul, man.

1004
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:04,467
- I can...
- Seasoning salt?

1005
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,670
- I can smell.
- Go. Go. Yes, showtime.

1006
00:55:07,845 --> 00:55:11,047
- Good to go. Perfect, perfect.
- Yes. Hey, Judy.

1007
00:55:11,222 --> 00:55:13,095
Hey, girl. That's a cute necklace.

1008
00:55:13,265 --> 00:55:14,972
- Nice. Okay, toast, okay?
- It's okay.

1009
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:16,339
- Toast.
- All right.

1010
00:55:16,517 --> 00:55:18,224
- I can hear better...
- Yo, yo, yo.

1011
00:55:18,393 --> 00:55:22,140
- I think my eyesight's better. Look...
- Is that Dorsey Levens?

1012
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:25,265
What, the Dorsey Levens?
Pro Bowl running back Dorsey Levens.

1013
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,763
- Good to see you.
- Thanks for inviting me.

1014
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,024
- I'm so glad you came.
- Wow, you look incredible.

1015
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:33,065
- Thank you.
- We have catching up to do.

1016
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,061
- So much has happened.
- Did he hit that?

1017
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:39,019
- No, no, no, they dated. Briefly.
- Okay.

1018
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:41,019
Thank you.

1019
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:47,032
It's 404-555-0132.

1020
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:50,118
Whoa,
they just exchanged numbers. Briefly.

1021
00:55:50,287 --> 00:55:52,078
Damn.

1022
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:54,664
Like, everything tastes better.

1023
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,325
- A chance to reconnect.
- Good.

1024
00:55:56,499 --> 00:55:57,779
- Wonderful.
- Hey.

1025
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:00,495
Hey, Byron.
You know Dorsey, don't you?

1026
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were on
my fantasy football team.

1027
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,707
Well, you know, used to be.

1028
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,922
Hey. Call me.

1029
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:12,047
I will.

1030
00:56:13,676 --> 00:56:16,841
So, what was that about?

1031
00:56:17,345 --> 00:56:18,886
What?

1032
00:56:19,054 --> 00:56:21,379
You guys exchanged numbers.

1033
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:24,509
- Numbers?
- Yeah, you know, numbers.

1034
00:56:24,683 --> 00:56:27,089
Oh, no, that's just to catch up.

1035
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:31,809
But, you know, if it bothers you,
I'll not do it if you don't want me to.

1036
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:35,311
No, no, no, not at all.
It's no problem at all.

1037
00:56:35,481 --> 00:56:36,512
I trust you.

1038
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:38,934
Good.

1039
00:56:42,068 --> 00:56:44,902
Man, you didn't tell me
what to do when that ex showed up.

1040
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:47,690
You didn't prepare me
for her ex, man.

1041
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,855
Dude's a football player.
I can't compete.

1042
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,315
Relax. He's her ex. No worries.

1043
00:56:53,491 --> 00:56:55,483
"No worries," he says,
ladies and gentlemen.

1044
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:59,193
You said we were just gonna whip her
into shape and I'd be better off for it.

1045
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,121
Guess what, Giz.
I don't feel better. I feel worse.

1046
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:06,327
Hey, stop acting like a little bitch.
You the man in this equation.

1047
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:09,701
- Do the hand check.
- I don't wanna do a hand check.

1048
00:57:12,336 --> 00:57:14,209
Still got your balls? Still there?

1049
00:57:14,379 --> 00:57:15,659
- Yes.
- Then act like it.

1050
00:57:17,089 --> 00:57:18,962
I'm standing
with my hand on my balls...

1051
00:57:19,132 --> 00:57:21,207
...and you're wearing boxers
and a cowboy hat.

1052
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:24,253
I was in the middle of something.
Gonna check on my soul mate.

1053
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:28,711
Why do I listen to you, man?
Why do I listen to you?

1054
00:57:29,471 --> 00:57:30,965
You okay, sweetie?

1055
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,549
- Baby, hurry up. I'm getting lonely.
- I know, I know. I'm trying...

1056
00:57:34,724 --> 00:57:36,882
...to wrap this up.
- Byron's having issues?

1057
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:39,596
He's all fucked up.
Some people don't know true love...

1058
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:41,560
...when they see it, baby.

1059
00:57:43,188 --> 00:57:45,061
Did you bring the tomahawk?

1060
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:49,184
Okay, he got to go.
I'm gonna get rid of his ass.

1061
00:57:50,776 --> 00:57:52,400
Byron, get the fuck out!

1062
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:56,066
I tried to apologise
and then I tried to compromise.

1063
00:57:56,237 --> 00:57:58,229
I got nothing left.
I don't know what to do.

1064
00:57:58,405 --> 00:58:02,900
- You gotta help me.
- Okay, okay, let's keep it together.

1065
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:06,738
Now, usually I would tell girlfriend
to move on to step four.

1066
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,286
Which means to move in for the kill
and tear his ass up.

1067
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:13,197
But look at him.

1068
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:17,369
He just so precious.

1069
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:19,866
She gonna sleep with him.
I know this in my heart.

1070
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:22,747
- She gonna sleep with him.
- No, she won't.

1071
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,461
Besides, what do you care?

1072
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:27,000
What?

1073
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:29,709
I mean, tell me why you're here.

1074
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,841
Because I love her.

1075
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,001
Then what's the problem?

1076
00:58:35,469 --> 00:58:37,674
Okay, I see where you're going
with this.

1077
00:58:37,845 --> 00:58:41,379
The love? The love is there,
but she just asked to meet my parents.

1078
00:58:41,556 --> 00:58:43,797
You know what that means.
I know what that means.

1079
00:58:43,974 --> 00:58:46,381
She wants to get married.
I don't know if I'm ready.

1080
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,014
I mean, l...
Because I just got this new job and...

1081
00:58:49,186 --> 00:58:52,269
Tiffany and I are having problems.
Giz is ridiculous. It's his...

1082
00:58:52,437 --> 00:58:55,887
- And, you know, I'm just so...
- Keith.

1083
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,558
You're so Keith.

1084
00:58:58,483 --> 00:58:59,514
Keith?

1085
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:04,856
Look, here's what you do.

1086
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:08,360
Tell her that you trust her
and encourage her to go on a date.

1087
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:13,905
I'm sorry. It sounded like you said I
should encourage her to go on a date.

1088
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:15,355
Trust me.

1089
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:17,112
I know what I'm doing.

1090
00:59:17,286 --> 00:59:20,949
When she's on the date with him,
she'll only be thinking about you.

1091
00:59:21,121 --> 00:59:24,868
As a matter of fact,
let her go out on a couple of dates.

1092
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,993
But don't let her go on several dates
with the same man.

1093
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:29,447
That's trouble.

1094
00:59:29,626 --> 00:59:33,290
But allowing her to go on a few dates
with a couple of men...

1095
00:59:33,462 --> 00:59:36,627
...will remind her of how shallow
the dating pool really is.

1096
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:38,543
I like the way you think.

1097
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:42,675
Yeah, I've been locked up a few times
but it ain't nothing.

1098
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:45,297
You know, I'm a singer
so I say sing. Yeah.

1099
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:51,388
Paris Hilton been locked up.

1100
00:59:51,556 --> 00:59:53,429
Martha Stewart, Martin Luther King.

1101
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,385
Yeah, Malcolm X, Lil' Kim.
They all been locked up. I get it.

1102
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,227
I said, " Look, I appreciate everything
you've done, Mama.

1103
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:00,592
But I'm a grown-ass man.

1104
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,726
Don't come in my room
without permission."

1105
01:00:02,896 --> 01:00:05,979
I told you the child-support cheque
come on the first of the month.

1106
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:09,979
What you talking about?
Word is bond. I'm gonna bust your...

1107
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,063
...gluteus maximus when I see you.
- I want you like MC Hammer want a hit.

1108
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:17,570
You know how bad he want a hit,
don't you? I can't touch this?

1109
01:00:17,738 --> 01:00:21,437
That's right, all eight months of it. All
eight months of it's coming. Got you.

1110
01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:23,489
There isn't much out there
to pick from.

1111
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:27,489
Especially when you consider the fact
that the majority of the brothers...

1112
01:00:27,661 --> 01:00:30,447
...are those kind of lean back
kind of brothers.

1113
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:32,079
You know what I'm talking about.

1114
01:00:32,247 --> 01:00:36,788
Whenever the cheque comes,
all of a sudden they lean back?

1115
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:42,374
Oh, this for you. Yeah. No, I told you
I didn't... I wasn't... Yeah.

1116
01:00:42,545 --> 01:00:44,537
I ain't bring it tonight.

1117
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:48,959
Can't touch this neither.

1118
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:54,625
Oh, shit. Sorry... Excuse my French.

1119
01:00:54,802 --> 01:00:57,043
You just heard me say
"child support," didn't you?

1120
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,011
Hook a brother up. Damn. It's 2008.

1121
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,634
Women got money anyway,
you know? Y'all blowing up.

1122
01:01:01,806 --> 01:01:04,343
2008, black women blowing up
Hey

1123
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:07,089
You know what I don't get?

1124
01:01:07,268 --> 01:01:12,770
If he loves me then why would he even
allow me to go out with someone else?

1125
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:18,763
I don't know. Maybe he just needs
to clear his head...

1126
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:20,519
...and I was getting in his way.

1127
01:01:20,693 --> 01:01:24,558
Or maybe you're getting in the way
of him and all those other tramps...

1128
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:27,689
...that keep throwing themselves
at him. Put their perky tits...

1129
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:29,986
...up in his face
because they got big tits.

1130
01:01:30,157 --> 01:01:32,563
And everybody don't got big titties.
They just don't.

1131
01:01:32,741 --> 01:01:36,239
You take a dude nobody wants,
you upgrade him...

1132
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,201
...and then his ass
wanna fly the nest.

1133
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,868
You know what that is to me?
That right there? That's that bullshit.

1134
01:01:42,706 --> 01:01:43,986
That's that bullshit.

1135
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:47,746
Now you've turned the tables.
But you don't stop there.

1136
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:51,700
Oh, no. Because now it's time
to hit her with the:

1137
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:56,128
I think we should just be friends.

1138
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,300
That's our line.
That's what we're supposed to say.

1139
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,922
He just wants to be friends?
What's that?

1140
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:07,378
- I know what it is. That's that bullsh...
- Bullshit. Bullshit.

1141
01:02:07,554 --> 01:02:09,462
- Yeah, we know, Monica.
- I'm just saying.

1142
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:12,424
You're always just saying.
What's with the bullshit?

1143
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:14,009
- It's that bullshit.
- Bullshit.

1144
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:16,139
- This is bullshit.
- I don't like you, okay?

1145
01:02:16,309 --> 01:02:18,384
- Yes, you do.
- It's about Tiffany.

1146
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,766
Would you... Monica!

1147
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:23,183
You got any mints?

1148
01:02:23,355 --> 01:02:25,927
Go, go, go! Come on.

1149
01:02:26,107 --> 01:02:28,513
This is supposed to be step four.

1150
01:02:32,277 --> 01:02:34,068
- I'm calling him.
- No. No, no, no.

1151
01:02:34,236 --> 01:02:38,280
Shante specifically said, " Do not call
him." Don't call him. Don't call him.

1152
01:02:38,447 --> 01:02:41,068
You know what? I'm getting
a little bit sick and tired...

1153
01:02:41,241 --> 01:02:43,565
...of what Shante has to say.
- Thank you.

1154
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:46,149
- Yeah.
- You know what? I'm calling him.

1155
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:48,568
Yeah, baby. Get your man.
Go ahead, get your man.

1156
01:02:48,745 --> 01:02:50,073
- Don't call him. Don't.
- Yeah.

1157
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:53,411
It's cool. Go ahead. So.

1158
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:55,040
Hello?

1159
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:58,739
Leave that phone alone. Let it ring.

1160
01:02:58,918 --> 01:03:02,083
She gets you
only after the fifth call.

1161
01:03:02,253 --> 01:03:03,960
That's one.

1162
01:03:04,796 --> 01:03:08,330
- I'm just gonna call him back again.
- That's two.

1163
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:10,174
This is your girl, Tiff.

1164
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:18,510
Hello, are you there? Tiffany.
It's your girl. Hello.

1165
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,094
And he's placed the ball
on the 44 yard line.

1166
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:26,131
It's just... Just a bad connection.
It's okay, he'll pick up.

1167
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:29,013
And then you must be busy.

1168
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:32,183
- Hello?
- Byron, you're there.

1169
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:35,058
Hi, you answered.

1170
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,981
Oh, hey, Tiff, what's up?

1171
01:03:37,149 --> 01:03:40,102
- H... How've you been?
- Oh, pretty good. Pretty good.

1172
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:43,478
Listen, Byron, I was just wondering
if maybe...

1173
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:47,895
...that you and I could hook up,
and talk.

1174
01:03:49,406 --> 01:03:54,612
Wow, Tiffany. I mean, I'd love to,
but I'm really kind of tied up right now.

1175
01:03:56,911 --> 01:04:01,452
Okay, well, maybe we could just...
Byron?

1176
01:04:02,914 --> 01:04:05,321
- It's okay. It's all right.
- Told you not to call.

1177
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:07,290
- Shante said don't call.
- It was cool.

1178
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:09,451
- You get...
- I'm just saying... I was just...

1179
01:04:09,627 --> 01:04:12,876
- Shante said, "Don't call."
- I'm here for you. You all that again?

1180
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,375
Thank you, Shante.

1181
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:18,586
But he invited me
to his going-away party.

1182
01:04:18,757 --> 01:04:20,002
Perfect.

1183
01:04:20,175 --> 01:04:23,340
At the party you'll implement
step number five.

1184
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:26,960
But first,
I want you to sleep with him.

1185
01:04:27,137 --> 01:04:29,461
- What?
- Give him some.

1186
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,804
- But I thought you said I shouldn't.
- Well, normally you shouldn't...

1187
01:04:32,974 --> 01:04:36,258
...but before a party like this
you must have sex with him.

1188
01:04:36,434 --> 01:04:39,517
And I'm not talking about
marriage-material sex.

1189
01:04:39,686 --> 01:04:42,355
I want you to get freaking nasty
on his ass.

1190
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:44,976
- Oh, my.
- Let him know that you can give him...

1191
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:48,064
...any and everything
that he ever wanted.

1192
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:52,312
Burn an image in his mind of what
you'll be doing to the next man...

1193
01:04:52,486 --> 01:04:55,272
...if you leave him.
- I see it.

1194
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:59,405
Number two:
And don't be mistaken...

1195
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:02,822
...there'll be groupies there,
and Byron may be tempted.

1196
01:05:02,992 --> 01:05:05,529
But Byron's a smart man,
and a smart man knows...

1197
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:08,536
...that you never give up sure booty
for more booty.

1198
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:13,613
- Yeah, but do you think it'll work?
- Girl, please. I'm Shante.

1199
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:17,572
Smith. Shante Smith.

1200
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:21,832
You dirty dog.

1201
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:24,493
- Tiffany, are you okay?
- Shut up.

1202
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:27,707
- What?
- Shut the fuck up.

1203
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:32,759
Baby, what's gotten into you?

1204
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:36,295
If I have to tell you shut up
one more time...

1205
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,841
Yes, ma'am.

1206
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:43,339
Right there, bitch. Right there.

1207
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:52,599
Almost there. Okay. Almost.
Almost there. Almost there.

1208
01:05:54,106 --> 01:05:55,683
- What are you doing?
- I'm done.

1209
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:59,189
- What?
- Thank you, I needed that. Come here.

1210
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,683
- I'll see you at the party. Yeah.
- What?

1211
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,185
You know what? B... Baby, baby.

1212
01:06:04,362 --> 01:06:06,318
I got things I gotta do.

1213
01:06:06,488 --> 01:06:09,060
Hey, wait. Wait.

1214
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,611
- Wait...
- Bye, baby.

1215
01:06:11,783 --> 01:06:15,993
My legs don't work. Tiff...
Tiff, help me on my legs.

1216
01:06:18,662 --> 01:06:20,618
Look, this is gonna sound
a little weird...

1217
01:06:20,788 --> 01:06:26,373
...but Tiffany and I just had sex,
all right? And it was fantastic.

1218
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:32,791
But the weird part is I'm not really sure
if I did her, or if she did me.

1219
01:06:32,962 --> 01:06:34,954
Who came over to whose house?

1220
01:06:36,214 --> 01:06:39,748
- Well, she did.
- Who initiated the sex?

1221
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:41,418
She did.

1222
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:43,668
Who got up and left?

1223
01:06:45,386 --> 01:06:46,761
She did.

1224
01:06:46,929 --> 01:06:49,384
Do you see where I'm going
with this?

1225
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:52,885
I know you were a little confused
by me telling Byron...

1226
01:06:53,058 --> 01:06:54,717
...to let Tiffany see other people.

1227
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:57,382
Looked like he was pulling
her card, right?

1228
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,010
But in actuality,
he was really pulling his own.

1229
01:07:01,187 --> 01:07:02,562
Now we're ready for step five.

1230
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,895
It's submission time

1231
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,984
Why you jumping up and down
like you just hit the numbers?

1232
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,859
She said it's time to submit.

1233
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:15,020
I ain't submitting to no-damn-body.

1234
01:07:15,571 --> 01:07:18,524
Well, maybe if you did, your love life
would be a little better.

1235
01:07:18,698 --> 01:07:20,357
Hold on, heifer. Hold on.

1236
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:23,022
Look, submission is the final step.

1237
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:25,441
I know it's the hardest thing
for a woman to do...

1238
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:28,073
...but in reality,
submission is taking control.

1239
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:32,372
Look at Gandhi, Martin Luther King.

1240
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:35,954
Last time I checked, ain't
no one of them had no coochies.

1241
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:42,086
Well, I do, and you see
the kind of man I got.

1242
01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:45,295
Yeah. Submit.

1243
01:07:54,177 --> 01:07:56,299
How are you, now?

1244
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:01,467
- I wanna talk to you.
- Yeah.

1245
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,846
I don't wanna fight anymore.
I'm not good at it.

1246
01:08:04,017 --> 01:08:07,431
It hurts me, it hurts you, and I just
don't wanna be a part of it.

1247
01:08:07,602 --> 01:08:12,511
So when you are ready,
you let me know.

1248
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:22,770
Now, barring any
unforeseen circumstances...

1249
01:08:22,945 --> 01:08:26,526
...you should have a ring
on your finger in about a week.

1250
01:08:26,697 --> 01:08:30,278
But let's keep it real.
Anybody can get people together...

1251
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:33,532
...but only a few can make it last.

1252
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:38,112
So there's only one more thing
that you must do...

1253
01:08:38,287 --> 01:08:40,575
...to make sure that your relationship
is real.

1254
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:42,157
This whole thing was a setup?

1255
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:43,611
This some bullshit.

1256
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,248
You and Shante
been running game?

1257
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:46,958
You acted like you liked me.

1258
01:08:47,126 --> 01:08:50,825
There have been three people in this
relationship: Me, you, and Shante.

1259
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:52,911
So, what you wanna do?
You wanna break up?

1260
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:54,166
I didn't say break up.

1261
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:57,208
No, no, no, I don't wanna break up.
Let's have make-up sex.

1262
01:08:57,382 --> 01:08:59,623
I'm not trying to marry
some scheming woman.

1263
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,337
I'm not trying to be with a guy
I gotta play games with.

1264
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,916
That I gotta convince to marry me.
I'm done.

1265
01:09:05,095 --> 01:09:06,126
Well, I'm done too.

1266
01:09:06,304 --> 01:09:08,379
- Fine. Fine.
- Fine. Fine.

1267
01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:11,471
I don't need this shit.
I don't need this shit. I'm out of here.

1268
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:16,547
- Take one last look.
- What's up?

1269
01:09:54,749 --> 01:09:58,082
All right, I know it looks
like I just messed everything up...

1270
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:02,413
...but trust me, breaking up
is a natural part of a relationship.

1271
01:10:02,587 --> 01:10:06,583
It gives you time to think,
to decide what you want.

1272
01:10:06,757 --> 01:10:09,293
It also gives you time
to deal with the truth.

1273
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:12,834
And even though the truth
might make you break up...

1274
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,465
...you can be sure of one thing.

1275
01:10:15,637 --> 01:10:17,214
If you get back together...

1276
01:10:17,388 --> 01:10:20,506
...girlfriend, y'all getting married.

1277
01:10:24,809 --> 01:10:25,840
And that's real.

1278
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:30,595
Baby, Byron can't even come.
He's gotta be in Seattle that same day.

1279
01:10:32,355 --> 01:10:34,561
I just feel so bad for him,
sweetie pie.

1280
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:36,474
Well, have you told him yet,
dumpling?

1281
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,602
No, boo-boo. Are you crazy?

1282
01:10:39,776 --> 01:10:42,859
He already thinks this is my fault.
If he finds out, it's a wrap.

1283
01:10:43,028 --> 01:10:45,518
Well, I mean, you gotta do it
sometime, baby.

1284
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:48,530
He doesn't even know
that we're back together, much less...

1285
01:10:48,698 --> 01:10:51,022
...you know, getting married.

1286
01:10:52,534 --> 01:10:56,032
Okay, look. Let's just run in here,
get the quickie-wedding package...

1287
01:10:56,203 --> 01:10:58,823
...and I'll deal with that later.

1288
01:10:58,996 --> 01:11:01,568
- Later?
- Eventually.

1289
01:11:02,415 --> 01:11:04,074
Someday?

1290
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,038
Okay. I'll tell him. Come on.

1291
01:11:11,503 --> 01:11:13,294
This is the life.

1292
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:16,001
Nothing like hanging out with
your boys, is there?

1293
01:11:16,173 --> 01:11:17,999
I know that's right.

1294
01:11:18,758 --> 01:11:21,426
I mean, women,
women are overrated.

1295
01:11:21,593 --> 01:11:23,881
Everybody thinks you gotta have one
to be happy...

1296
01:11:24,053 --> 01:11:26,590
...but where would I be right now
if I had a woman?

1297
01:11:26,763 --> 01:11:29,762
- I probably wouldn't even be here.
- Exactly. Exactly.

1298
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:32,551
And who would I rather be with?
Her, or you?

1299
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:37,723
Come on. Hey, you wanna order
a pizza or something?

1300
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,512
So you really miss her, don't you?

1301
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,804
Oh, dude, you have no idea.

1302
01:11:43,814 --> 01:11:46,731
How about you? You...
You really miss Candy?

1303
01:11:48,692 --> 01:11:50,731
Well, not exactly.

1304
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:54,478
Way to man up, man. Way to man up.
I'm proud of you.

1305
01:11:54,654 --> 01:11:59,610
- Way to clutch those balls, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clutch... Balls.

1306
01:12:01,408 --> 01:12:03,234
Hey, by the way, man...

1307
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:08,369
...me and Candy,
we getting married.

1308
01:12:08,538 --> 01:12:12,119
Hello, how are you doing today?
What would you lik e on your pizza?

1309
01:12:13,457 --> 01:12:15,164
Get the hell out my house, man.

1310
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:18,333
You ruin my life, then you up
and decide to marry Candy?

1311
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:21,074
You don't understand.
I've been infected by her nectar.

1312
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,041
- What?
- I'm powerless.

1313
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:26,538
She got a hold on me.
She's the one.

1314
01:12:26,715 --> 01:12:29,584
Who are you? Who does this
to their best friend?

1315
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:32,379
I was perfectly happy with Tiffany,
but no, no, no.

1316
01:12:32,552 --> 01:12:34,010
You couldn't leave me alone.

1317
01:12:34,178 --> 01:12:38,256
"Be a man. Come on. Be a man.
Come on. Grab your nuts."

1318
01:12:38,889 --> 01:12:40,596
Hey, man, I love her.

1319
01:12:40,765 --> 01:12:43,884
Forget your love, man. You lost me
the love of my life...

1320
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,473
...while you were out finding yours.
The hell am I supposed to do now?

1321
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:51,763
Hold up.

1322
01:12:51,938 --> 01:12:53,480
What are you doing?

1323
01:12:53,648 --> 01:12:55,189
I'm gonna look it up.

1324
01:12:55,357 --> 01:12:57,681
Looking what...? Give me that.

1325
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,647
You trying to tell me the entire time
you've been giving me advice...

1326
01:13:06,822 --> 01:13:09,739
...it's from some bullshit book?
- It's not just some book.

1327
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:12,279
He wrote the book on the game,
knows every trick.

1328
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:15,071
- How do you think I been so happy?
- Giz!

1329
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:19,618
You know what, man? No.

1330
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:24,614
To hell with love. To hell with games,
to hell with you.

1331
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,246
And your nuts.

1332
01:13:35,965 --> 01:13:37,624
Come on, Tiffany. Cheer up.

1333
01:13:38,299 --> 01:13:40,789
My mom always said,
"You can bring a horse to water...

1334
01:13:40,968 --> 01:13:43,043
...but you can't make him..." Exactly.
- Drink.

1335
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:44,298
I know.

1336
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,553
You know what, if he's not thirsty
then why should he?

1337
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:50,721
Tiffany, look. The best thing you can
do now is just wait it out.

1338
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:53,973
Shante said his mom
and his sister are your best allies.

1339
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:56,300
They'll pressure him.
He'll come around.

1340
01:13:56,477 --> 01:14:01,552
"Come around"? Is that really what I'm
waiting for him to do? Come around?

1341
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:04,642
You know what? I can't anymore.
I can't do this.

1342
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:07,815
- Oh, Tiff, come on. Don't... Tiffany.
- I don't care.

1343
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:09,643
Man.

1344
01:14:11,569 --> 01:14:13,644
I really thought she had him
at "Submission."

1345
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:15,859
I'm just tired of the whole
depression thing.

1346
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:19,647
See, that... That's that bullshit.

1347
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:25,651
Yeah, so it's just not
gonna work out.

1348
01:14:29,663 --> 01:14:31,323
Carla.

1349
01:14:31,498 --> 01:14:33,039
It's work. I gotta take this.

1350
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,365
No. No.

1351
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:40,283
You know, Byron, I never thought
I would say this...

1352
01:14:40,461 --> 01:14:42,702
...but you are acting like an idiot.

1353
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,910
Mom, don't start...

1354
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:50,125
There are some things in life that are
more important than fame and money.

1355
01:14:50,301 --> 01:14:56,586
Like friends. You and Giz have
been friends for God knows how long.

1356
01:14:57,722 --> 01:14:59,797
And Tiffany?

1357
01:15:01,099 --> 01:15:03,849
Do you know how rare it is
to find someone...

1358
01:15:04,017 --> 01:15:06,554
...who really wants
and loves you for you?

1359
01:15:06,727 --> 01:15:09,727
I know. I know, but, Ma...

1360
01:15:09,896 --> 01:15:13,145
She's been manipulating me
to marry her the whole time.

1361
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:16,730
Just follow your heart.

1362
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:42,204
- Hey, Tiff.
- Hey.

1363
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:48,126
- How's everything?
- Everything's fine.

1364
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:55,995
Look, I talked to my mom
and my sister.

1365
01:15:57,257 --> 01:15:59,000
Look, after giving it some thought...

1366
01:15:59,967 --> 01:16:03,382
...I wanted to see
if we can make this happen.

1367
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:06,879
Make what happen, Byron?

1368
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:08,845
You know, you know.

1369
01:16:09,014 --> 01:16:11,053
You could wrap up
what you need to do here...

1370
01:16:11,224 --> 01:16:13,548
...and then come out
to Seattle with me...

1371
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:17,259
...and we could try
this marriage thing.

1372
01:16:20,605 --> 01:16:22,643
- The marriage thing?
- Yeah.

1373
01:16:23,231 --> 01:16:25,851
The marriage thing?

1374
01:16:27,108 --> 01:16:29,978
Byron, I wouldn't marry you
if you were the last man on Earth.

1375
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:37,312
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- God, you really don't get it, do you?

1376
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:40,738
This isn't a marriage thing for me.

1377
01:16:41,325 --> 01:16:46,069
I don't wanna be your wife by default.
I actually wanna be your only choice.

1378
01:16:46,245 --> 01:16:49,909
So, Byron, as much as I love you,
we're through.

1379
01:16:51,248 --> 01:16:52,623
Tiff...

1380
01:16:57,085 --> 01:16:58,199
Tiff...

1381
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:02,744
Damn, girl,
that wasn't even in the playbook.

1382
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:31,724
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

1383
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:35,478
- You look good.
- Thank you.

1384
01:17:36,442 --> 01:17:38,398
Trust me,
you're doing the right thing.

1385
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:40,476
We're gonna do
wonderful things together.

1386
01:17:41,111 --> 01:17:42,439
Wonderful things.

1387
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:44,737
Excuse me.

1388
01:17:47,073 --> 01:17:48,104
Mr. McKinzie.

1389
01:17:49,783 --> 01:17:52,024
This is Carla. Yes, how are you?

1390
01:17:52,618 --> 01:17:55,736
We're actually on our way
to the airport. Yes.

1391
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:58,778
It's the strangest thing.

1392
01:17:58,955 --> 01:18:03,283
But without the bad in life,
you really can't appreciate the good.

1393
01:18:05,584 --> 01:18:08,500
That's funny. " It's hot as hell
in the church." That's crazy.

1394
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:10,708
- Hello?
- She's gone.

1395
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:13,747
I lost him.

1396
01:18:16,507 --> 01:18:19,542
When you lose someone you love,
it's...

1397
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:22,582
It's like a gaping hole.

1398
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:25,333
An emptiness. I hate him but...

1399
01:18:25,512 --> 01:18:29,129
I don't understand how you can love
and hate somebody at the same time.

1400
01:18:29,306 --> 01:18:30,848
Just don't make no sense to me.

1401
01:18:31,016 --> 01:18:32,675
- It's weird.
- It's strange.

1402
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,138
I used to think marriage
was the worst thing...

1403
01:18:35,435 --> 01:18:37,059
...but now I see it's a good thing.

1404
01:18:37,228 --> 01:18:39,800
Truth be told,
this is the happiest I've ever been.

1405
01:18:39,979 --> 01:18:42,516
I mean,
do you really want my advice?

1406
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:45,606
I've been taking it this long.
No point in stopping now.

1407
01:18:45,775 --> 01:18:48,015
But now it's coming from me,
not some stupid book.

1408
01:18:48,193 --> 01:18:51,477
In all honesty, men are afraid
they'll never find that special person.

1409
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:53,111
And most won't.

1410
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,777
But if you're lucky enough to find her,
then you can't let her go.

1411
01:18:56,948 --> 01:18:59,901
No problem,
but I think if we reverse that...

1412
01:19:00,075 --> 01:19:01,237
What are you waiting for?

1413
01:19:02,368 --> 01:19:03,778
What do I say to her?

1414
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:05,327
It's what I do.

1415
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:09,995
- Sure.
- Grab your balls, say your vows.

1416
01:19:10,164 --> 01:19:13,330
Get off the phone, come get your wife.
I've got a wedding to go to.

1417
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,285
Idiot. Giz's wedding is today.

1418
01:19:18,461 --> 01:19:22,373
Okay, I will call you when we land.

1419
01:19:22,546 --> 01:19:25,333
And you have a great day,
good talking to you.

1420
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:29,498
It's all good.

1421
01:19:31,135 --> 01:19:33,886
- Pull over. Pull over.
- What are you doing?

1422
01:19:34,512 --> 01:19:37,216
- Going to get my woman.
- What?

1423
01:19:40,932 --> 01:19:45,011
- I'm going to get my woman.
- Byron, you're making a huge mistake.

1424
01:19:45,185 --> 01:19:47,426
Understand,
if you're going to be the trainee...

1425
01:19:47,603 --> 01:19:50,223
...then it's business first,
starting with this trip.

1426
01:19:51,022 --> 01:19:54,852
Leave now, and I will see to it
that you are terminated...

1427
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:57,645
...and that the runner-up
will get your job instead.

1428
01:19:57,818 --> 01:20:00,272
Do what you gotta do, Carla.
This is my business.

1429
01:20:00,444 --> 01:20:01,475
This is my life.

1430
01:20:04,405 --> 01:20:07,855
Excuse me, sir. I need your cab.
It's a matter of national security.

1431
01:20:08,032 --> 01:20:09,823
Your government
will take care of you.

1432
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:12,030
You can call the office
of Homeland Security.

1433
01:20:12,201 --> 01:20:14,276
Drive! Nice ascot.

1434
01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:21,415
Let's go.

1435
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:57,258
- You gonna stare like that?
- What is wrong with you?

1436
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,393
- I wasn't staring.
- I was watching you.

1437
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:03,262
I told you about hitting me in public.
There was something on her dress.

1438
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,183
Gorgeous.

1439
01:21:28,872 --> 01:21:31,990
Woman, what is your malfunction?
What is wrong with you?

1440
01:21:32,499 --> 01:21:35,582
This is great. I mean, really.

1441
01:21:35,751 --> 01:21:39,201
The head doctor getting married?
Hilarious.

1442
01:21:39,378 --> 01:21:43,125
Oh, my gosh, girl, I just told you,
I really, really like her dress.

1443
01:21:43,297 --> 01:21:44,328
It's awesome.

1444
01:21:44,506 --> 01:21:47,541
I just can't believe
she is really wearing white.

1445
01:21:49,593 --> 01:21:51,964
But them shoes is hot, though.

1446
01:21:52,136 --> 01:21:56,712
We are gathered here today
in the sight of God...

1447
01:21:56,889 --> 01:22:01,762
...to unite this man and woman.

1448
01:22:02,225 --> 01:22:06,435
Guys, this should be me.
I mean, what did I do wrong?

1449
01:22:06,603 --> 01:22:08,559
This is it right here.
Right here. Stop.

1450
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:11,729
Okay, look, just keep it, all right?
It should cover the ticket.

1451
01:22:11,898 --> 01:22:15,265
If anyone sees any reason
why this man...

1452
01:22:15,441 --> 01:22:18,441
...should not be joined
to this woman...

1453
01:22:20,986 --> 01:22:24,769
...speak now or forever
hold your peace.

1454
01:22:27,907 --> 01:22:28,986
Tiffany.

1455
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,441
What? What is that?

1456
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:32,648
Oh, my God.

1457
01:22:33,202 --> 01:22:37,779
My bad. Y'all just... It's not really...

1458
01:22:37,955 --> 01:22:39,993
Tiffany? Tiffany, where are you?

1459
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:43,283
- What the hell? Hold up, homie.
- Cousin Swole, it's okay. It's okay.

1460
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,411
- Go on, sit down. It's okay.
- It's okay, Cousin Swole.

1461
01:22:48,294 --> 01:22:50,085
- Giz, Giz, I'm sorry.
- Dude.

1462
01:22:50,254 --> 01:22:52,080
- B.
- Byron.

1463
01:22:52,255 --> 01:22:54,211
Good luck. Good luck.
I'm sorry about this.

1464
01:22:54,381 --> 01:22:56,788
Candy, by the way,
you look beautiful in your dress.

1465
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:58,164
She wore white. Who knew?

1466
01:22:58,342 --> 01:23:01,176
Excuse me. Excuse me, y'all look cute,
how are y'all doing?

1467
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:04,427
Byron, what are you doing?
I can't believe you're doing this now.

1468
01:23:04,596 --> 01:23:08,010
I have to do it right now. I love you.

1469
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:12,847
I miss you. Every second without you
in my life is too long for me.

1470
01:23:13,017 --> 01:23:16,219
Every second in this church
is a hundred bucks for me.

1471
01:23:16,394 --> 01:23:17,557
So let's hurry it up.

1472
01:23:19,063 --> 01:23:22,513
Wrapping it up, sir. Tiff, can I see you
over here for a second?

1473
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,765
Go on, get your man, baby.

1474
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:28,396
Sorry.

1475
01:23:28,568 --> 01:23:32,611
Look, I'm a little unprepared to...

1476
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:35,649
Because, you know, I'm supposed
to be getting on a plane...

1477
01:23:36,656 --> 01:23:37,936
...not getting on my knees.

1478
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:44,201
This is the only ring I got
so it's gonna have to do.

1479
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:51,155
I promise to buy you a real one once I,
you know, get a new job, because l...

1480
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,750
I kind of quit my old one.

1481
01:23:56,585 --> 01:24:00,284
Byron, we have had our differences
in the last few weeks.

1482
01:24:00,462 --> 01:24:02,703
And we've played a lot of games,
and I just...

1483
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,833
I know, Tiffany, I know.
I know and I'm sorry.

1484
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,253
But I do love you.

1485
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:17,553
I love you and nothing would make
me happier than to marry you.

1486
01:24:18,265 --> 01:24:22,308
- So sweet.
- I know.

1487
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,882
For better or for worse, right?

1488
01:24:26,019 --> 01:24:29,019
In sickness and in health.

1489
01:24:29,188 --> 01:24:31,974
And... And...

1490
01:24:32,898 --> 01:24:33,929
Little help here, Giz.

1491
01:24:34,858 --> 01:24:36,814
- Shits and giggles?
- Shits and...

1492
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:43,937
For richer or for poorer, as long...
As long as I shall live.

1493
01:24:44,697 --> 01:24:48,396
Baby, will you marry me?

1494
01:24:53,702 --> 01:24:55,990
Take him back, girl.

1495
01:24:56,871 --> 01:24:58,662
Say yes, girl. Say yes.

1496
01:25:01,666 --> 01:25:04,369
Yes. Yes, I'll marry you.

1497
01:25:07,711 --> 01:25:10,379
Oh, my God.

1498
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:31,092
You know I'm charging you
double for this, right?

1499
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:38,267
Okay, cool, cool.

1500
01:25:39,396 --> 01:25:43,606
Grab a seat. Sorry about that, y'all.

1501
01:25:47,401 --> 01:25:49,274
Let's get you married.

1502
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:52,563
Scoot back, bro. I'm the best man.

1503
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:54,729
It's nice to have
a little breaking news...

1504
01:25:54,906 --> 01:25:58,818
...but let's take care
of God's situation first.

1505
01:25:58,991 --> 01:26:04,066
Again, let this be an example
to this couple.

1506
01:26:04,245 --> 01:26:06,616
Showing what true love is.

1507
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:12,705
What was lost is now found,
365, 24/7.

1508
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:17,286
This marriage was made in heaven.
You may kiss the bride.

1509
01:26:29,885 --> 01:26:31,628
Get a room.

1510
01:26:34,429 --> 01:26:37,631
You don't...? I don't know how to egg?
You're showing your real colours.

1511
01:26:37,806 --> 01:26:40,094
- You're showing them now.
- Staring at everybody.

1512
01:26:40,266 --> 01:26:42,388
At a wedding,
and you're staring at the bride.

1513
01:26:42,559 --> 01:26:44,101
- Learn to how to be lucky.
- Lucky?

1514
01:26:44,268 --> 01:26:46,723
I told you the light-skinned brother
is coming back.

1515
01:26:46,895 --> 01:26:50,097
- I'm a get me a dark-skinned...
- Hey. Call me.

1516
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:52,810
- The love doctor?
- The love doctor.

1517
01:26:52,982 --> 01:26:55,768
Girl, I'm calling you in the morning.
He is off the chain.

1518
01:26:55,942 --> 01:26:59,310
- And we will fix that.
- In the morning, girl.

1519
01:27:02,154 --> 01:27:06,446
Don't you just love a happy ending?
And the wedding was so beautiful.

1520
01:27:06,615 --> 01:27:07,990
- Baby, you ready?
- Yeah.

1521
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,908
I'm gonna get the car
so you don't have to walk too far.

1522
01:27:13,036 --> 01:27:14,150
What?

1523
01:27:14,328 --> 01:27:17,244
All that talking and y'all didn't think
that Shante had a man?

1524
01:27:17,413 --> 01:27:21,030
He's fine too.
Y'all know I like chocolate.

1525
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:22,950
I'll see you next time.

1526
01:27:28,545 --> 01:27:29,576
We always hear:

1527
01:27:29,754 --> 01:27:32,326
"You don't need a man,
you don't need a man."

1528
01:27:32,797 --> 01:27:37,707
When you can admit
you need this person, that's love.

1529
01:27:37,884 --> 01:27:40,041
This is Atlanta, it's like 15-to-1.

1530
01:27:40,218 --> 01:27:43,218
You got the brothers locked up,
gay guys.

1531
01:27:43,387 --> 01:27:46,138
You got, like, 30, 45 girls
just for you.

1532
01:27:46,305 --> 01:27:47,882
You pick one, that's love.

1533
01:27:48,056 --> 01:27:53,760
Love is like new shoes,
they just make you feel good.

1534
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,093
I don't even pretend
to understand love.

1535
01:27:56,270 --> 01:28:01,689
I just know I've been looking for it
my whole life and now I found it.

1536
01:28:01,856 --> 01:28:04,856
- She got me.
- She got me.

1537
01:28:06,151 --> 01:28:07,810
We got got.

1538
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:14,361
- Thank you, Shante.
- Shante, thank you.

1539
01:28:14,531 --> 01:28:17,483
See? Told you.
Told you my system works.

1540
01:28:17,657 --> 01:28:19,733
A good man may be hard to find...

1541
01:28:19,909 --> 01:28:22,363
...but a hard man
will make you phone a friend.

1542
01:28:22,535 --> 01:28:24,492
Hey.

1543
01:28:25,495 --> 01:28:29,077
Go, Shante. Go, Shante.
Work it out, work it out.
