SAVAGE: Phobos runs
on Martian time.

182
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,990
A Martian day is called a sol.

183
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,702
A sol is 24 hours
and 39 minutes long.

184
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:57,548
Phobos is the innermost
and larger of the two Martian moons,

185
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,546
and the research facility
is located

186
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,798
a click north
of the Stickney crater.

187
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,676
Yes, sir. Is all this
information gonna be on the test?

188
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,927
SAVAGE: Shut up, Rance.

189
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,342
Oh, it's fine, Doc.
Join us.

190
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,603
You all know
Dr. Bennett Stone?

191
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,396
If not, now you do.

192
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,065
He's hitching a ride with us.

193
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,359
Now, the facility is built
into the moon,

194
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,152
and is divided
into three levels.

195
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,905
Main level includes
the cargo bay,

196
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,698
various offices,
living quarters,

197
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,993
administrative offices
and amenities.

198
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,785
Level two, service
and maintenance.

199
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,995
It's also where they store
the computer servers.

200
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,203
And finally, level three

201
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,379
contains the laboratories
and reactor.

202
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,956
What kind of a reactor?

203
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,340
Fusion reactor.

204
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,919
Nuclear?

205
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,720
Yeah, but it's safe.

206
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,908
Because nothing bad
ever happened

207
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:46,932
with nuclear power.

208
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,850
Well, the moon poses
more risk than the reactor.

209
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,598
What do you mean?

210
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,897
Well, Phobos is one of the most
unstable environments in the solar system.

211
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,460
That's why they call it
"the Doomed Moon."

212
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,691
Cool.

213
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,356

214

Pardon me, Tarek?

226
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,560
Well, we're security.
So what's to secure?

227
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,979
Well, UAC's intellectual
property being developed here

228
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,897
is worth billions
on the black market.

229
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,351

231

232
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,523

235

You fucked up, Lieutenant.

236
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,933
And now we're all stuck here

237
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,414

238
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,616
All right, knock it off!

239
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,664

and fail as a unit.

you will reveal

The past three decades,
the prime focus of the UAC

782
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:44,039
has been to locate a planet outside
of our solar system to colonize.

783
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:48,373
If the human race wants to live on,
it has to find a new home.

784
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,041
And while we found
several possible candidates,

785
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,622
getting to them
hasn't been feasible.

786
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,551
Now, this man
was telling the truth.

787
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,679
The evidence was several large
stone-like slabs

788
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,849
with an inscription
carved into them.

789
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,143
What kind of inscription?

790
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,144
It was a version
of Sumerian,

791
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,439
but with subtle,
yet distinct, differences.

792
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,974
We call them gates.

793
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,643
So what are they?

794
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,528
They make it possible to travel
from one point to another

795
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,231
without traversing
the physical space between them.

796
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,989
Teleporters. The aliens
left teleporters?

797
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,199
We've found two sets so far.

798
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,787
One here and one on Earth.

799
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,145
We didn't want to disturb
their environment,

800
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,411
so we just built the bases
around them.

801
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,338
And while these are
the only ones we've found,

802
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,839
our theory is that there are others
all across the universe.

803
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,344
Based on what?

804
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,888
The gates are approximately

805
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,761
seven-and-a-half thousand
years old,

806
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,676
and they're made from
a chemical compound

807
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,228
that we've yet to identify.

808
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,057
So if they're not from here...

809
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,892
They must come from
somewhere else.

810
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,067
DR. BETRUGER: Precisely.

811
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:59,865
Now, we've spent decades just trying
to figure outwhat we have,

812
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,944
and the amazing thing is,
is that the gates predate the pyramids,

813
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,199
and yet they won't work

814
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,781
unless they're hooked up
to technology

815
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,544
which we've
only just created.

816
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,130
So it's as if
they knew where we'd be

817
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,503
in our evolution

818
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,210
when we found them.

Who are "they", Doctor?

820
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,674
Now there's
the billion-dollar question.

821
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,143
So, what happened
today?

822
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,891
You turned on these
gates and then...

823
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,230
Like I said,
I don't remember.

824
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,771
Well, it doesn't take
a fucking genius to figure it out.

825
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,190
You turned them on,
and those things from

826

came flying in.

827

us were once humans.

They worked here.
They were in their clothes.

829
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,550
I saw their ID badges,
but clearly something

830
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,435
came through and did this
to them, changed them.

831
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,746
Yeah, I saw
what came through.

832
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,997

835
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,169
And to make it clear,
they were demons.

836
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,671
Demons?

837
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:05,765

838
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,054
One of them took me.

839
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,225
Tried to possess me,

840
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,770
tried to turn me into
one of those things.

841
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,523
No, those slabs
ain't for travel.

842
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,726
They opened up
a portal to Hell

843
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,311
for those things
to come through.

844
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,730
Don't be ridiculous.
This was just a setback.

the fuck out of here.

you and I are in absolute agreement.

We're heading back
to the ship.

852

that's not going to happen.

- DR. BETRUGER: We need to restore power to the base.

854
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,474
No, we don't.

855
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,183
I will not lose this base.

856

be sacrificed!

allow is irrelevant.

928
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,225
Well, one of mankind's earliest forms
of language was Sumerian.

929
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,390
What if they were the ones
who brought the language to us?

930

And with their
advanced technology,

931
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,335
what if they're responsible
for other mysteries, too?

932
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,639

were built?

01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,845
We're Marines, we fire, too.

1050
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,638
Those new things
we just fought

1051
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,206
ain't former humans
like the ones before.

1052
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,311
They're something else.

1053
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,918
WINSLOW: And if we turn
these gates on,

1054
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,684
who the fuck knows
what else could come out next?

1055
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,899
What, and if we don't,
we all die when the base melts down.

1056
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:33,989
If we wait, we die.

1057
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,405
If we do nothing, we die.

1058
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,824
If we're gonna die,

1059
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,572
I would rather
go down fighting.

1060
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,074
Okay.

1061
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:43,660
Yeah.

1062
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,667
Yeah.

1063
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,913
Good. Well, once
the power's restored,

1064
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,841
it will only take a few minutes
to go through its procedures,

1065
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,447
and it will meet
all the safety checks.

1066
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,595
Time's wasting.
Check your ammo, reload and take extra.

1067
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,297
Prepare to move out in five.

1068
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,933
Hey. Even if I'm able
to get that reactor started,

1069
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,065
under no circumstances should we attempt
to go through those gates.

1070
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,382
Forget about
what's the other side.

1071
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,467
The last time
they were used,

1072
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,927
they almost destroyed
the entire base.

1073
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,512
Another trip through's
gonna almost certainly do it.

1074
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,528
- I know.
- But you told Dr. Betruger...

1075
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:23,203
Exactly what
he needed to hear.

1076
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,702
I might not be a scientist,
but I'm not an idiot.

1077
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,954
We get the power back on,
we get the base back online,

1078
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,580
we contact Command
to send help.

1079
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,415
I just didn't want him being a pain
in the ass the rest of the time.

1080
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:46,812
Clear.

1081

- Yeah, we're clear.

You know how to work this?

1089
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,355
I'm gonna have my personal drive
access the reactor...

1090
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,527
- I didn't ask for your life story.
- Okay.

1091
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:35,998
We're in.

1092
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,674
You're Lieutenant Joan Dark.

1093
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,954
In the mayhem of the moment,

1094
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,890
I completely forgot
who you were.

1095
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:57,858
You're the one that set
Rudolph Martin free.

1096
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,903
He's one of the most dangerous
terrorists in the world.

1097
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,071
That's not exactly
how it happened.

1098
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,237
DR. BETRUGER:
Of course not.

1099
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,400
I'm sure you've got
your side of the story.

1100
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,222
See, I'm briefed on all matters
that pertain to this base,

1101
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:12,081
so I only read the official conclusion
of the review board.

1102
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,328
Although it did
strike me as odd

1103
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,081
that a unit
as accomplished as yours

1104
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,661
should be assigned here.

1105
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,835
As I recall, you disobeyed
a direct order,

1106
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,470
so my base is your punishment.

1107
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,474
Here we go.

1108
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,181
Fixable?

1109
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:41,022
Yeah. There's a circuit board
that's fried.

1110
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,716
I don't have a new one,
but I'm gonna take out the dead board,

1111
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,824

into thinking it's there.

Was it your ego, Lieutenant?

Or did you
just know better?

1115
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,746
Or did you make a mistake?

1116

I certainly do. (LAUGHING)

Ah, Private Winslow.

1119
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,258
In your testimony
to the review board,

1120
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,385
you said Lieutenant Dark
was incompetent,

1121
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:14,969
should be arrested
and dishonorably discharged.

1122
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,981
Private Corbin,
you asked to be reassigned,

1123
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:22,650
citing that you could never
trust Lieutenant Dark again.

1124
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:25,153
Joan, I never said that.

1125

DR. BETRUGER:
And your Captain Savage,

1126
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:31,319
he asked if Lieutenant Dark
was guilty of treason!

1127
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,783
Treason!

1128
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:39,326

the death penalty.
