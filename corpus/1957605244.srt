Then one day, boom, he
started offing everyone.

Shot up the boss
real bad, left town.

Now, I got close sources that
say since he's left the boss

has sent at least three
or four guys after him.

00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,435
Wow, the ceremony
was that bad?

181
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:45,372
These people are blind.

182
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:48,242
They live in their own world.

183
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,011
Yeah, well, that's
good for business, girl.

184
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,748
They're best kept in the dark.

185
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,293
Speaking of business,

186
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,702
heard the preacher
has been acting funny.

187
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:21,475
Well, we should go visit her

188
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:28,348
[car engine revs]

189
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,847
[fire crackling]

190
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,449
[soft music]

191
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,096
[Boon groans]

192
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,875
[Boon pants]

193
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:49,631
[Boon groans] [Boon pants]

194
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,143
[Boon groans]

195
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:12,820
[birds chirping]
[wind whooshing]

196
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:36,309
[soft music]

197
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:16,884
[car engine revs]

198
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,766
[car door closes]

199
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,471
I wasn't sure if this
was the right cabin.

200
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:38,906
I thought I'd check up on you.

201
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:42,777
Oh, it's better.

202
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,817
And I also wanted to
apologize for last night.

203
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:54,622
I'm just protective
of my son, obviously.

204
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,890
And we've had a crazy week.

205
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,859
We have some work
being done in our land.

206
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:59,259
I understand.

207
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:03,965
You probably need to
rest, so we'll be off.

208
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,570
If you should ever
need to go into town,

209
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:12,807
I don't mind taking you,
until you're healed up.

210
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,676
That'll work.

211
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,991
[soft music]

212
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:46,040
[car engine revs]

213
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,679
So Nick, where are you from?

214
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:59,053
Lots of places.

215
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,054
Moved around a lot?

216
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,058
My father was a Colonel

217
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:08,095
and I've seen tons of
army bases in my life.

218
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,698
When I got married
and I got pregnant,

219
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:13,466
I was so happy to
plant some roots.

220
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,738
I didn't want them growing
up like me, vagabond.

221
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,018
Widowed or divorced?

222
00:22:39,594 --> 00:22:43,363
[clears throat] So how
long have you lived here?

223
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,934
A few weeks.

224
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:48,035
Weeks in that cabin? [laughs]

225
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:50,004
That place is pretty-

226
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,639
- Shitty?

227
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:54,742
Elijah, keep that kind of
language out of your mouth.

228
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:55,710
Yes ma'am.

229
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,144
Pardon me, but he's right.

230
00:22:59,146 --> 00:22:59,947
It's shitty.

231
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,451
But I like it, it's
quiet and it's-

232
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:07,655
- Hidden?

233
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:15,428
I sympathize,
sometimes I wish Elijah

234
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:18,599
and I could just disappear.

235
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:19,934
Stay hidden from everyone.

236
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:26,507
St. Francis has mass today,

237
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,842
and that's why you're going?

238
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:34,982
They have those beautiful
bells that ring every day.

239
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,651
I've always liked the
Catholic tradition

240
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:38,085
of daily mass, actually.

241
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:44,892
One must be very
devout to go every day

242
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:47,995
or have a lot to atone for.

243
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:59,439
[car engine revs]

244
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,979
Thanks for the ride.

245
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:05,880
See you kid.

246
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:11,552
[car engine revs]

247
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:15,589
[soft music]

248
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:17,558
[Boon sighs]

249
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:20,795
[soft music continues]

250
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,768
Heavenly father,
please give us strength.

251
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:04,972
We know you have a plan
for all of your children,

252
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:09,510
and we know you comfort
those who are waiting.

253
00:25:19,787 --> 00:25:22,923
[footsteps pattering]

254
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,069
[indistinct chatter]

255
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:39,640
After you.

256
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:42,243
Thank you.

257
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,713
Good morning, young man.

258
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,114
You ever heard of knocking?

259
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:49,884
Yes, thank you.

260
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:50,951
Is your mother in?

261
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:57,825
[speaks in foreign language]

262
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,896
[door knocks]

263
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,033
[Catherine] Mr. Fitzgerald?

264
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:07,601
Morning.

265
00:26:07,635 --> 00:26:09,003
We need to talk, Catherine.

266
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:14,642
Well, Mrs. Nelson's
husband just passed,

267
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:17,678
so I really need to
be here right now.

268
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,580
Oh, that's terrible.

269
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,584
I'm sorry for your
loss Mrs. Nelson.

270
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,387
Thing is though...

271
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,355
We have an appointment.

272
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,192
You do?

273
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,059
Yeah.

274
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,098
Okay, give me a
second, will you?

275
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:39,166
[sighs] Of course.

276
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:50,744
[Fitzgerald sighs]

277
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,285
Didn't you used to
have a secretary

278
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,687
or something around here?

279
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,289
Had to let her go.

280
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,893
Half of my congregation
left after I took over.

281
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,896
But you know that, don't you?

282
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:17,171
Well, I hope there's no
hard feelings about that one.

283
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:21,909
I mean, I have no problem
with a female pastor.

284
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:24,044
I mean, it's 2021,
for Christ's sake.

285
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:29,016
Some of my partners, some
people in the community,

286
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,118
are a bit more
conservative than me.

287
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:32,353
Got it.

288
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,889
I thought maybe you came here
to tell me that I'd see you

289
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:36,891
at the Sunday service.

290
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:37,791
No, no, no.

291
00:27:39,126 --> 00:27:42,930
As much as I do love to
hear the word of the Lord,

292
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,134
I'm a very busy man, very busy.

293
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,404
But I always have
my Bible with me.

294
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,807
So you don't have
to worry about me.

295
00:27:56,977 --> 00:27:59,213
[sighs] We have come here today

296
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:03,450
to talk about a little project,

297
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:05,753
and how it's moving along.

298
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:06,820
This is a good thing.

299
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,857
It's a great thing
for the community.

300
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:15,262
For you. That little
man out there.

301
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:26,106
You may benefit, but I'm not
so sure about my son or me.

302
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,713
You know how much I trusted
your husband's judgment?

303
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,349
His friendship?

304
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,884
I took his counsel.

305
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,355
He's a godly man, a good man,
and you should trust him.

306
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,094
I did trust him, but that
doesn't mean I trust you.

307
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:52,366
I don't know what it
is you're going to do

308
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,968
when that tunnel is dug.

309
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,537
I don't care to know.

310
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,239
I just want you to do it,
do it and leave us alone.

311
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:05,145
That's exactly what we
intended to do, Catherine.

312
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:09,216
So just turn a little
blind eye for a while

313
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,353
and we'll be gone, okay?

314
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,255
We're just moving cargo.

315
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,124
Nothing to worry about.

316
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:21,228
Look, my son and I have
done everything you asked.

317
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:26,133
We've kept our head down and
we've let those low lives

318
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,301
into our home for you.

319
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:31,038
We won't get in your way.

320
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:37,545
I'm so happy to
hear that, Catherine.

321
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:41,248
Happy, happy, happy.

322
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:45,419
'Cause I would have
hated to remind you

323
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,024
of the debt your
husband owes to Emilia.

324
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:55,530
And what you and
your family owe her.

325
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:05,039
You'll never have
to remind me of that.

326
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:11,412
Good.

327
00:30:14,048 --> 00:30:16,917
[car engine revs]

328
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:26,026
Have yourself a good day.

329
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,566
I appreciate the
ride and everything.

330
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:39,907
Maybe we'll bring you
dinner tomorrow night.

331
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,344
I'd like that.

332
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,245
Great.

333
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:48,282
See you later, Nick.

334
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:09,937
[ominous music]

335
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:09,062
Damn fine tunnel we made here.

336
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,532
As a bonus.

337
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,000
You think they'd throw
in some those guns

338
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,168
they're smuggling?

339
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:17,371
Why? What, you
hunting with AR-15s now?

340
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,306
Keep your mouth shut
about that, all right?

341
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,408
You don't ever talk
about the cargo.

342
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:23,410
This Fitzgerald guy's paying
us a shit load of money.

343
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,345
So we don't wanna
go fuck it up, okay?

344
00:32:29,016 --> 00:32:31,619
[birds chirping]

345
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:36,223
[soft music]

346
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:40,628
[indistinct]

[soft music]

348
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:07,321
Hey kid, where's your mom?

349
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,562
When a man asks you a question
it's better you answer.

350
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,166
Hey, pretty preacher.

351
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,434
She's upstairs changing.

352
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:25,105
[Pryce] Wish I could
join her. [laughs]

353
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:35,182
What game are you playing?

354
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:48,262
You see when I was your age,
it was just me and my mom too.

355
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,165
And I remember one day
coming home crying.

356
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:56,571
Bigger kids roughed
me up, again.

357
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:01,743
She went inside, she
came storming back out

358
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:02,744
with a switchblade.

359
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:09,082
And she said, "If one of
those bigger kids ever come

360
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:12,520
at you again, you cut
those mother fuckers.

361
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,624
And I promise you, they'll
never pick on you again."

362
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:25,432
You see kid, look
at me, look at me.

363
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,072
You can choose to be fearful

364
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,075
or you can choose
to be fearless.

365
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,146
Now you tell me what
that game is gonna do

366
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,080
for you right now.

367
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:43,183
What's it gonna to do?

368
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,753
What's going on here?

369
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:48,322
[laughs] Saved by mommy.

370
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,557
Where were you earlier today?

371
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:50,825
I was at my church.

372
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:54,461
Well boss lady
doesn't want you in town

373
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,330
while we're working,
you stay here.

374
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:01,234
Well if I don't go to my
people, they come to me.

375
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,871
And that's not allowed
right now, correct?

376
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,472
You just keep
everyone off your land

377
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:06,641
until we're done, okay?

378
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:11,646
Elijah, come help
me with the firewood.

379
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:21,689
Please leave my house.

380
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,861
Prettiest preacher
I ever seen.

381
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:31,264
[birds chirping]

382
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:49,651
I'll be in the tunnel.

383
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:53,387
You better lay off that
shit, you look fucking messy.

384
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:56,189
Fuck you.

385
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:58,826
[birds chirping]

386
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:23,918
Up we go.

387
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,941
[Boon pants]

388
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,480
[Boon grunts]

389
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:25,479
What's wrong, boy?

390
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:27,582
Do I scare you?

391
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:30,785
I do?

392
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:34,354
Little old me?

393
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:36,724
Shit I ain't scary.

394
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:41,963
I know scary, men.

395
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,934
I'm pretty nice once
you get to know me.

396
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:55,375
Always on that video game thing.

397
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:56,711
Book.

398
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:57,912
Book, game, whatever.

399
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:01,549
How much these things worth?

400
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,523
Let me see the damn thing.

401
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:10,925
[ominous music]

402
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:11,826
Now!

403
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,028
Stop!

404
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:21,803
You better tell your little
boy here to be careful.

405
00:38:21,836 --> 00:38:25,039
You don't touch him,
ever, you hear me?

406
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:30,077
[laughs] Well, aren't
you all high and mighty.

407
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,582
You're drunk.

408
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:39,754
Hell yeah, I'm drunk.

409
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:42,523
I'm celebrating, woman.

410
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,061
And I'm getting paid
pretty handsomely.

411
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:49,664
Completing the tunnel and all,

412
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:53,466
and well, I thought
you could join me.

413
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,107
I know since your
old man is dead,

414
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:05,445
you in need of some good
old fashioned adult company.

415
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:09,750
You got something sweet for me?

416
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,888
You go play in the woods, boy.

417
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,456
I'm warning you to shut up.

418
00:39:25,432 --> 00:39:27,500
The fuck you gonna
do about it preacher?

419
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:32,073
[both grunting]

420
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,543
No! Elijah run.

421
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:39,881
Go!

422
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,785
Where you going, preacher?

423
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:48,155
[groans] Fucking bitch!

424
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:51,125
[Catherine groans]

425
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:59,600
You gonna be a
good whore for me?

426
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:07,909
[laughs] Where you
going jackrabbit?

427
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:10,778
[Pryce grunts]
[Catherine groans]

428
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:12,079
Sir, help!

429
00:40:16,684 --> 00:40:17,551
I've always wondered

430
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:21,022
what it's like to be
with a woman of God.

431
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,791
I bet it's divine.

432
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:24,959
You can't do this.

433
00:40:27,061 --> 00:40:28,896
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

434
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:33,935
Hey.

435
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:36,671
[Pryce groans]

436
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:45,646
Are you all right?

437
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,115
[Pryce coughs]

438
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:56,023
Everything's good, it's
going according to plan.

439
00:40:56,057 --> 00:40:58,759
Hey, hey!

440
00:40:58,793 --> 00:41:00,127
Stop! Drop it!

441
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:04,098
[Pryce groans]

442
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,710
Drop it.

443
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,712
[gun clicks]

444
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:18,612
Now.

445
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,785
[Pryce coughs]

446
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:37,264
Get your ass up, Pryce.

447
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:48,876
Someone wanna tell me
what happened here?

448
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,080
He assaulted us.

449
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:57,018
Assaulted? He hit you?

450
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:05,292
Oh, you mean he tried to...

451
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:07,561
You stupid mother fucker, Pryce.

452
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,067
You wouldn't want this
going to Mr. Fitzgerald.

453
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:15,736
You know I wouldn't.

454
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:20,207
If he so much as looks
at me again I'll tell him.

455
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:26,814
Where'd you come
from white knight, huh?

456
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:29,650
You the preaches boyfriend?

457
00:42:30,885 --> 00:42:31,919
He's our neighbor.

458
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:34,922
Oh, yeah? [laughs]

459
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,658
Well, ain't that
fucking neighborly?

460
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:38,893
Coming over here to help.

461
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:40,961
Good on you.

462
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,032
Pryce, get in the damn truck.

463
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,971
You'll be seeing
me again, big boy.

464
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:52,840
I promise you that.

465
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,016
[car engine revs]

466
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:12,760
Who are they?
What did they want?

467
00:43:21,102 --> 00:43:22,703
Nick, Nick, don't.

468
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,273
Please, don't.

469
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:25,666
What are they moving?

470
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:32,106
I don't know. I
don't wanna know.

471
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:34,208
I gotta go.

472
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:46,854
Elijah, come on.

473
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:48,489
Nick!

474
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,961
Please, don't go.

475
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:54,862
I'm scared.

476
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:01,435
Kid, if I stay, you and your
mom will be in more danger

477
00:45:01,468 --> 00:45:02,803
than you already are.

478
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:08,142
At least for tonight.

479
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:10,844
Just to make sure Pryce
doesn't come back.

480
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:15,216
I made him angry. Please.

481
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:39,006
[phone buzzes]

482
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:43,877
Redd.

483
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:46,180
[Man] Where the hell are you?

484
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:48,249
I'm afraid I
can't tell you that.

485
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:51,218
[Man] You know what kind
of you're getting into?

486
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:53,821
Well, I wouldn't be good
at my job if I didn't.

487
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:59,326
When I grab this asset,
we'll be able to bring

488
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,228
that whole damn house down.

489
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,932
[Man] Man, you're
fucking crazy, Redd.

490
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,767
Yeah, I take that
as a compliment.

491
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:20,381
[Redd sighs]

492
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,359
Did I find you?

493
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:35,996
Oh, I think I did.

494
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:44,405
I think you're being
a bit presumptuous.

495
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:47,041
People around here
don't have vision.

496
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,375
Nobody wants change.

497
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:51,312
I say okay to a
condominium development

498
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:53,447
and my office gets
hundreds of complaints

499
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,082
because you know why?

500
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:57,451
People want green surrounding
them in spring and summer.

501
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:00,555
And they want white snowy
mountains in winter, not concrete.

502
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,928
That being said, I agree
with you and your party.

503
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,331
I say, develop the
town, but do it right.

504
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:15,336
Yeah, Maxine,

505
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:20,307
I've been called a lot
of things in my life.

506
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:23,243
Presumptuous has never
been one of them.

507
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:28,015
You see we've been securing
all this real estate

508
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:31,118
for the miles, just
for this reason.

509
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:37,257
And me being the sole
financier, should have you jump

510
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:40,227
out your knickers to
get involved with this.

511
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:46,300
Think, no outside
investments, no foreigners.

512
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:51,438
Home grown talent,
building up this city.

513
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:54,441
Then that is a beautiful thing.

514
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,911
That Mayor is the
American dream.

515
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,415
Emilia, care to join?

516
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,120
[speaks in foreign language]

517
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:08,122
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

518
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,022
It's Mateo.

519
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:12,326
Mateo, cab.

520
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:15,329
Make sure it has legs.

521
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:19,634
[sighs] Nothing sexier than
a woman who runs a tight ship.

522
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:24,271
Glad to see that your
business is doing good.

523
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:28,242
Yeah, since my boy passed,

524
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,246
rest his soul,

525
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:38,452
Emelia here has been
running this business

526
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:39,920
like a little empire.

527
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,193
Hey, the usual,
make it a double.

528
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:50,030
[door knock]

529
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:51,298
Oh, Jesus.

530
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:53,934
[soft music]

531
00:49:04,445 --> 00:49:07,347
Well, got to cut
it short Mayor,

532
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:11,619
but as always,
it's been an honor.

533
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:18,626
Now, you make sure

534
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,730
you push them permits
through right quick, okay?

535
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:27,334
It's good for town and I'll
make sure it's good for you.

536
00:49:29,102 --> 00:49:30,738
You take it easy, Mayor.

537
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:33,273
[soft music]

538
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:37,978
[footsteps pattering]

539
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:40,582
The check when your ready.

540
00:49:48,556 --> 00:49:50,090
[speaks in foreign
language] Bud.

541
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:58,332
So, how many times have I told
you can't fucking come here?

542
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:01,435
Sorry, this was an emergency.

543
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,103
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

544
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:05,105
I'm assuming the
tunnel is finished.

545
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:06,641
Yeah, yeah,
we're finishing up.

546
00:50:08,676 --> 00:50:10,578
What's the emergency?

547
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:14,214
It's the preacher woman,
she had someone fuck up Pryce.

548
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:19,119
Really?

549
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,487
I came out of the shed

550
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,489
and Pryce was getting
his ass beat by this guy.

551
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:24,726
Almost took his face
off, fuck him up good.

552
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,262
[speaks in foreign language]

553
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,296
I don't...

554
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:30,565
What?

555
00:50:30,598 --> 00:50:32,232
Who is this guy?

556
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:36,103
Tall. Had white hair. But
he knew what he was doing.

557
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:38,740
I guess Pryce was breaking
balls with the kid

558
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,008
and preacher lady
didn't like it.

559
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,176
So she came down, she punches
him and this fucking guy comes

560
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,113
out of nowhere with a
shovel and fucked him up.

561
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,349
Oh, preacher ain't no saint.

562
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:54,556
Okay, well, [indistinct] you
shouldn't fuck with her kid.

563
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:00,193
When we have a mother scorned.

564
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:03,798
That's gonna be rough.

565
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:06,166
We should go talk to this guy.

566
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,769
Have a chat.

567
00:51:07,802 --> 00:51:09,303
No, no, no, no, no.

568
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,540
This first deal
has to get through,

569
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:17,579
no matter what, on time.

570
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:22,115
We'll revisit this, go see
this white hair feller,

571
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:25,553
and we'll all get along.

572
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:28,523
Great, mother fucking kumbaya.

573
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:40,100
You see that,
Bud? Can't have it.

574
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:42,804
I can't have Emelia
going off the rails.

575
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,506
It never ends well for anyone.

576
00:51:47,474 --> 00:51:49,611
So you tell Pryce

577
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:53,313
to keep those creepy
little redneck hands

578
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:54,582
off that mother and son.

579
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:57,150
What about this guy?

580
00:51:57,184 --> 00:51:58,753
I mean, if Pryce sees him,
he's not gonna stand down.

581
00:51:58,786 --> 00:51:59,821
He's gonna go after him.

582
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:01,388
Pryce ain't go do nothing.

583
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,492
[tense drum music]

584
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:09,897
When this is done, you
can take care of him.

585
00:52:10,865 --> 00:52:12,299
You can take them all out.

586
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:16,436
But that tunnel... that
tunnel gets finished.

587
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:23,343
Is that your son?

588
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:24,277
He was.

589
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,848
How did he die?

590
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,253
Emilia put a knife
through his throat.

591
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:35,657
[soft music]

592
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:39,259
I didn't know.

593
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:41,829
What?

594
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:46,668
I didn't know.

595
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:49,671
Of course you fucking did.

596
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,205
[soft music]

597
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:11,793
Thank you for staying
until he went to sleep.

598
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:12,960
I'm sorry we kept you.

599
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:21,903
You're gonna judge me
for this, but so be it.

600
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,588
I thought so.

601
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:49,697
[sighs] I used to hate
the thought of it.

602
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:55,870
Drinking to drown your
sorrows always seemed so weak.

603
00:53:59,807 --> 00:54:01,609
No need to confess to me.

604
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:03,310
That's another thing
I've always liked

605
00:54:03,343 --> 00:54:05,947
about you, Catholics,
confession.

606
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:11,552
Hard thing to do, spilling
your guts to a stranger.

607
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:16,657
I can tell you have
something eating at you.

608
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,741
Something eats at me as well.

609
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:41,849
Sinning.

610
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:49,791
My husband spent his whole
life avoiding it, preaching.

611
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,961
He put his faith above it,

612
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,698
and I was so proud
to be his wife.

613
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:03,004
[sighs] But he
soon fell into sin.

614
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:06,707
All because of his wrath.

615
00:55:18,586 --> 00:55:23,591
[sobs] Our daughter
was taken from us

616
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:30,731
by a young man, car wreck.

617
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:34,334
He'd been drinking.

618
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:47,615
[sobs] Elizabeth just
needed a ride home,

619
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:53,521
but she was the only one to die.

620
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:02,563
He lived, served his time,

621
00:56:03,898 --> 00:56:05,867
but Don couldn't get past it.

622
00:56:11,772 --> 00:56:14,775
He was consumed by it,
our church floundered.

623
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,947
And then he made a
horrible decision.

624
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:26,754
He found out what
Emelia and Fitzgerald

625
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:28,522
really did for a living.

626
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:34,896
Kept it from me, but he knew
the kind of people they were.

627
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:39,567
He went to them for vengeance.

628
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:47,775
They took that man and
killed him. [cries]

629
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:02,723
Don sold his soul to the devil.

630
00:57:06,193 --> 00:57:08,529
I have to let them
use my land now.

631
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:19,874
That's my confession.

632
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:24,712
That's what eats at me. [cries]

633
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,668
I killed people.

634
00:57:53,274 --> 00:57:54,208
Most deserved it.

635
00:57:56,277 --> 00:57:57,712
Some I'm not so sure.

636
00:58:01,248 --> 00:58:02,616
Would you do it again?

637
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:07,088
If I had good reason.

638
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:18,032
Well, look at
us, two lost souls.

639
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:26,040
You and your son need
to get out of here.

640
00:58:28,576 --> 00:58:30,177
That's not an option.

641
00:58:30,211 --> 00:58:31,879
I have my church.

642
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:34,782
For God's sake, my husband
and daughter are buried here.

643
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:38,819
Do you think these people
are just gonna up and leave?

644
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:41,522
There are two options here.

645
00:58:42,656 --> 00:58:44,025
You're gonna get
arrested with them

646
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:45,026
when the cops find the tunnel

647
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,928
or they're going to
kill you and your son.

648
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:52,833
So if you won't leave, you're
gonna have to deal with it.

649
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:54,635
Deal with it?

650
00:58:54,668 --> 00:58:56,137
It seems like the only option.

651
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,307
I am not going to kill anyone.

652
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:03,244
I didn't say you.

653
00:59:07,148 --> 00:59:10,751
I am not going to have
anyone kill on my behalf, ever.

654
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:15,156
They need me and my son for
whatever it is they're doing,

655
00:59:16,724 --> 00:59:18,826
and they'll be gone and I
can move on with my life.

656
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:52,226
They were my sister's.

657
00:59:55,396 --> 00:59:56,764
She used to collect them.

658
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:20,321
[water drips]

659
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:22,289
What are you reading?

660
01:00:24,024 --> 01:00:25,192
"Gulliver's Travels."

661
01:00:27,027 --> 01:00:27,895
You're back.

662
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,297
Yeah.

663
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:35,736
You're heading into
town this morning

664
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,705
to meet your business
partners, right?

665
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:41,375
I'm going to my church
and then I'm going to see

666
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:45,379
if Fitzgerald can just
forget the whole ordeal.

667
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:48,682
I'm coming with you.

668
01:00:54,922 --> 01:00:56,023
And then what?

669
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,825
I don't know.

670
01:00:57,858 --> 01:00:59,059
Tell him you hired me.

671
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:00,728
[laughs] Hired you for what?

672
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:02,396
Odd jobs.

673
01:01:03,598 --> 01:01:06,033
Just let them know that I'm
gonna be around for awhile.

674
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:14,408
[birds chirping]
[train whistling]

675
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:27,354
So this is not going as
swimmingly as we had hoped,

676
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:30,157
has it now, Catherine?

677
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:33,227
Well, I came to tell you that

678
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,095
we won't be a bother
to you anymore.

679
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,998
Not that we have been.

680
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:40,401
To be fair, it's your
men who aren't very-

681
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:43,237
- Very what?

682
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:49,243
Uneducated? Uncouth? Zero tact?

683
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:54,148
I know this, it's
why I hired them.

684
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,349
To get the job done.

685
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:00,487
Much like your friend.

686
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,190
Nick, is it?

687
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:05,759
[tense music]

688
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:07,728
Tell me something, Nick.

689
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:14,268
What brings a fella
such as yourself here

690
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:15,469
to our little town?

691
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,474
[speaks in foreign language]

692
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:21,375
Shh, hey.

693
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:25,212
Guys, excuse my daughter-in-law.

694
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,748
She can be very passionate.

695
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,418
I was just passing through,

696
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,855
but now I think
I'll stay awhile.

697
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:37,992
[clears throat] He's
just renting a cabin

698
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:40,094
on the property next to us.

699
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,396
Catherine hired me to
fix the place up a bit.

700
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:46,233
Did she now?

701
01:02:49,036 --> 01:02:51,205
I'm mighty good with my hands.

702
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:53,040
Well, I bet you
fucking are son.

703
01:02:54,842 --> 01:02:59,280
And no doubt you now know
about our little enterprise.

704
01:03:02,182 --> 01:03:04,785
You've got one month until
we shut the tunnel down.

705
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,488
Now wait!

706
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:10,257
After that, you'll
get off her land.

707
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:12,793
Okie dokie.

708
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:25,939
Elizabeth.

709
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:31,812
Thank you.

710
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,450
One for the road.

711
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:39,153
[tense music]

712
01:03:43,357 --> 01:03:44,224
No?

713
01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:49,229
Fuck off.

714
01:03:55,102 --> 01:03:59,106
Catherine, see you after.

715
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,509
[tense music]

716
01:04:03,077 --> 01:04:06,480
[Catherine clears throat]

717
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,436
He's gonna be trouble.

718
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:31,506
Not for much longer.

719
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:36,176
I'm... [chuckles]

720
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,378
You're what?

721
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:40,114
I'm fucking angry! How
dare you speak for me!

722
01:04:40,147 --> 01:04:41,382
Catherine, calm down, I-

723
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,552
- Get your own ride back.

724
01:04:44,586 --> 01:04:45,986
And you know what?

725
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:47,154
Don't step foot on
my property again.

726
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:50,090
- [Boon] Catherine-
- No.

727
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:52,159
Catherine. [sighs]

728
01:05:04,572 --> 01:05:07,307
[ominous music]

729
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,045
Yeah, I got eyes
on him right now.

730
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:15,983
You want us to do it now?

731
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,184
[Emilia] Not in town.

732
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,152
Understood.

733
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:20,921
[ominous music]

734
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:22,923
A little longer, buddy.

735
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:26,493
I'm gonna smash his
nose with a shovel.

736
01:05:29,363 --> 01:05:30,532
I brought it.

737
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,199
That's the dumbest
shit I've ever heard.

738
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,968
[ominous music]

739
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:45,479
White hair, gray
fedora, bingo.

01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:49,983
[ominous music]

741
01:05:59,426 --> 01:06:00,260
Boon!

742
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,499
Don't move, keep
looking forward.

743
01:06:08,603 --> 01:06:09,537
The fuck?

744
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:15,610
Who's that?

745
01:06:17,444 --> 01:06:21,081
It looks like is you after
all, hiding in plain sight.

746
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:24,051
Clever but not original.

747
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,352
You probably think
I'm one of those guys

748
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:27,221
hired to come out
here and kill you.

749
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:29,990
Shit!

750
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,061
I'm gonna have you take
a little trip with me.

751
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:36,497
Where to?

752
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:38,031
One way ticket to DC.

753
01:06:38,065 --> 01:06:41,034
Oh, and I forgot to
introduce myself, Agent Redd.

754
01:06:41,068 --> 01:06:42,469
Pleasure.

755
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:45,640
I'm actually surprised
how easy it was to find you.

756
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:47,241
Once we got the drop
on your location,

757
01:06:47,274 --> 01:06:50,010
all it took was some inbred
informant to give you up.

758
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:53,648
Okay, we've got
to grab them both

759
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:54,616
and take them out of town.

760
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:56,483
Don't you fuck this up, Pryce.

761
01:06:57,552 --> 01:06:59,386
I know what to god damn do.

762
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:00,287
Yeah.

763
01:07:03,357 --> 01:07:05,092
So why won't you go on
and slide on these cuffs?

764
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:09,196
Try not to make a scene and
make this easy for yourself...

765
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:11,533
[Boon groans]

766
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:12,700
The fuck are you?

767
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:14,836
[Pryce] Shut up.

768
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:17,772
Come one shot [indistinct].

769
01:07:17,805 --> 01:07:19,339
[gun clicks]

770
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:21,141
I'm the big, bad wolf baby.

771
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:25,279
Now both of you, get
in the fucking truck.

772
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:26,280
I'm afraid that's a negative.

773
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:27,615
Why don't you go on and
get out of here, pal...

774
01:07:27,649 --> 01:07:28,850
I got a rental any way.

775
01:07:28,883 --> 01:07:31,184
Don't make me ask twice.

776
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:33,053
I will light you
up mother fucker.

777
01:07:33,821 --> 01:07:36,858

[Bud] Hey, it's Bud.

784
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:18,666
I know who it is, is it done?

785
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,269
[Bud] No, there's a problem.

786
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:25,540
We didn't get him,
we ran into trouble.

787
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:26,541
There's someone else
trying to take him out.

788
01:08:26,574 --> 01:08:29,577
I don't know, maybe he
got him, I don't know.

789
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:30,912
We're on our way to
the preacher's now

790
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:34,247
then we'll head to his shit hole
cabin and we'll do a clean sweep.

791
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:38,820
Okay, no more fuck ups now.

792
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:43,858
Oh, and one more thing, kill
the preacher and the kid.

793
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:49,697
[birds chirping]

794
01:09:08,281 --> 01:09:09,550
It'll be okay.

795

[car engine revs]

796
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:28,803
No, I told you, I
don't want you here.

797
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:30,370
They're gonna kill
you and your son.

798
01:09:30,404 --> 01:09:31,806
You've got to trust me on this.

799
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:35,510

800
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:40,213
Shit! Shit. [sighs]

801
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:45,352
I know that you're trying
to help and I appreciate it.

Shit.

God damn fed is here, shit.

807
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,690
I got to call the boss lady,
you keep your damn cool, Pryce.

808
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,492
Shut the fuck up, dad.

809
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:31,999
That's it, here we go.

810
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:44,946
Whoa! Hey, preacher bitch.

811
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:47,380
Why don't you come on out here?

812
01:10:51,686 --> 01:10:53,487
Does that thing work?

813
01:10:53,521 --> 01:10:54,989
I don't know.

814
01:10:55,022 --> 01:10:56,524
I got something for you.

815
01:10:57,825 --> 01:10:59,392
You and your fucking kid.

816
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:02,029
I'm gonna go talk to them.

817
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,665
Shut the fuck up, Pryce!

818
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:09,670
I'm gonna put them both
in the fucking ground.

[dramatic music]

820
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,642

That was pretty savage, cowboy.

825
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:44,705
The way you killed Pryce,
you did me a favor.

826
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:45,807
I was going to kill
that idiot anyway.

827

828
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:55,415

Where are you?

835
01:13:01,782 --> 01:13:02,650
Fuck you.

We're 30 minutes out.

841
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,954
Is it done? Bud?

842
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:44,992
It's done.

843
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:50,631

That's it, it's all over.

848
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,794
You have more shells for this?

849
01:14:21,762 --> 01:14:23,097
Catherine, do you
have any more shells?

850
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,165
I know where they are.

851
01:14:27,835 --> 01:14:29,704
We have to get out of here.

852
01:14:29,737 --> 01:14:30,905
I have to save Elijah.

853
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:34,141
We don't have time for that,
they're already on their way.

854
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:37,511
We have a better chance
to hold our ground.

855
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,480
Oh, Jesus.

856
01:15:26,794 --> 01:15:27,661
Boon.

857
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:32,166
You gotta love phones these
days, you can track 'em.

858
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:35,069
Just in case some one tries
to take and steal your car.

859
01:15:35,102 --> 01:15:37,304
We don't have time for this.

860
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:39,006
Don't you even think about it.

861
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:44,278
Now, you and me are gonna take
a little walk back to my car.

862
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:52,987
I'm not going anywhere.

863
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:55,322
You sure about that?

864
01:15:55,356 --> 01:15:56,257
Any second now
there's gonna be people

865
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:58,125
coming up that hill
ready to kill all of us.

866
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,894
We're wasting time.

867
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:01,195
I don't care.

868
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,798
All I want is for you
to get on a plane.

869
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:04,965
Now move.

870
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:07,001
And leave them here to die?

871
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:07,968
Leave who to die?

872
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:16,777
Elijah.

873
01:16:17,945 --> 01:16:20,815
Son, you don't wanna get
yourself involved with this.

874
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:23,117
You know what happens
when you pull a gun

875
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,118
on a federal agent?

876
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:25,986
I do.

877
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:34,695
Over by the fireplace.

878
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:48,209
Welcome to the shit show.

879
01:16:51,745 --> 01:16:52,913
Give me that.

880
01:16:52,947 --> 01:16:54,248
What are we gonna
do? Kill them all?

881
01:16:57,852 --> 01:16:58,686
Yeah.

[ominous music]

886
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,787
Lady, I don't know how you
and your son are involved

887
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:36,290
with this man, but you should
know he's bad for your health.

888
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:39,059
He's one of the most ruthless
criminals in the country.

[Fitzgerald] Are
we on schedule?

892
01:17:51,272 --> 01:17:53,107
Yes, of course.

893
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,942
And Catherine?

894
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:57,912
[Emilia] We're
going with plan B.

895
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:01,448
Emelia, that
complicates things.

896
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:07,188
If you gonna do this
they have to disappear.

897

I'm so sorry, baby.

903
01:18:37,552 --> 01:18:39,353
I'm so sorry for all of this.

904

Where are you going?

905
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:48,229
I can stop them
from harming us.

906
01:18:48,262 --> 01:18:50,431
Fitzgerald knew my
husband, they were friends.

907
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:51,832
They're not gonna kill me.

908
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:53,901
Should be me the
one going out there.

909
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:56,203
I'm the fed, they'll
listen to me.

910
01:18:56,237 --> 01:18:57,371
Shut up.

911
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:58,973
I can't let you go out there.

912
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:03,978

[speaks in foreign language]

914
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,861
You really need all
these men here, Emelia?

915
01:19:24,999 --> 01:19:26,166
Just being thorough.

916
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,870
Enough of this.

917
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:32,072
I've been bullied and
scared for too long.

918
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:36,477
I'm not gonna hurt you
or your son, preacher.

919
01:19:38,012 --> 01:19:40,147
But that man inside
there has to die.

920
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,349
And then it would just
be business as usual.

921
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:47,354
This all can stop now.

922
01:19:49,223 --> 01:19:51,125
I've tried to live with
what my husband has done

923
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:51,825
for too long.

924
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:55,796
I've tried to do
right by my son.

925
01:19:56,598 --> 01:19:58,098
What are you trying to say?

926
01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:02,069
Help her.

928
01:20:07,174 --> 01:20:08,342
We have to do something.

929
01:20:09,611 --> 01:20:12,079
Do what you will, Emilia,

930
01:20:12,112 --> 01:20:14,415
but know that I won't be
your prisoner any longer.

931
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:16,417
I'll tell them what he did.

932
01:20:17,351 --> 01:20:19,219
The deal he made, what you did.

933
01:20:21,322 --> 01:20:25,993
May the Lord have mercy
on my soul and yours.

934
01:20:26,026 --> 01:20:31,031
[scoffs] Did you think
I had a conscience?

935
01:20:34,101 --> 01:20:37,971
That I don't just sleep easily
at night knowing what I did?

936
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,876
Because I do, and
trust me when I say,

937
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:48,583
after I kill you and your son,

938
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:52,886
I plan on going home tonight

Take this, go in

father-in-law. [sighs]
