Oh, what's going on, people?

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,440
All right, great to be back here in New York, man.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Miss it, my hometown, love it here, love it.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,140
The best thing about it is the pizza.

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,840
Gotta be the best in the world here in New York, yeah.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
(audience cheering)

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,480
Yeah.

00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,640
Hi, how's it tonight?

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,080
I had it tonight, you know what, suck though?

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,880
I had to share it with other people.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,080
Way too much pressure when you're all

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,080
from the same pie, especially when the slices start getting lower and lower.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,080
You gotta look around the room, do that pizza math or...

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
[laughter]

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Alright, he already had two slices right there.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,080
He should be out at this point right now.

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,080
What the hell is she doing? What is this?

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Finish the cross, that doesn't count?

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,080
I hate when it comes down to two slices.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,080
One slice is like, "YOUGE!"

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,080
And there's like little mutant sliver slice next to it.

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Never really made it.

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
The guy went a little too quick with the wheel.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Hey!

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
And you beat her.

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
All right.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,080
I never get the big slice either.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Someone's always like, "Hey, I'll take the big one."

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
"Okay, I'll get it for you."

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,080
I make it up in cheese, though.

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Oh, the cheese fell off.

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
I don't know what happened.

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,620
Sorry about that. I was separating it from the other pieces and she slid off. I don't know how

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:27,540
Here and enjoy your skin flap that's for you

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,880
That piece that looks like my ass if it caught fire and someone put it out with an old t-shirt is yours

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,320
I don't like surprises and my pizza. I hate that they annoy me

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,380
I get my pizza home, I open the box.

46
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,880
There's a little plastic white ottoman in the middle.

Little things like that annoy me.

52
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Like, I love the delis here in New York. Great delis here in the city, too.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Unbelievable delis. Yeah.

54
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Yeah, you can watch where a deli -- [ Applause ]

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Great. You know what's things? Every time I'm always online,

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
I'm always stuck behind the construction guy,

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
ordering for like the whole site.

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Yeah, hey, don't.

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Give me 48 coffees, 98 bagels, three bags of fone,

Let's go, let's go!

How big are muffins gonna get before we all join hands

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
across America?

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
They're huge.

67
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,880
If you walked in, yeah, I'll take a coffee and--

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Oh my God!

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Yeah, I'll have the bean bag chair with raisins.

70
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Oh, you got it?

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Oh, I got it.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I got it.

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Woo, yeah!

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,880
All right, can't believe this is fat-free!

All right, hey, you want to help me to the trunk of my car?

78
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,920
No, leave the saran wrap on it.

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920

See, that's a thing with muffins.

82
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,660
Muffins used to be like the size of a cupcake.

83
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,160
No more, right? Now it's either the very big muffin

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,100
or the mini muffin. What is with --

85
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,400
Yeah, they fill me right up, right?

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
It's like taking aspirin. All right.

I got a blueberry.

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,320
They just tick me off, you know?

98
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,960
Like this bothered me, and it probably shouldn't have.

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
But I was out of Met Game.

Never. You-- I'm at the game.

104

It's not the boy I'm at the game.

105
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,080
And they sit me next to a guy and he's eating an apple.

(audience laughing)

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
First of all, does that not piss you off right there?

Guy eating an apple and it chased Eddie.

110
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
You shouldn't be allowed fruit in a ballpark, first of all.

111
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,160
It's like beer hot dogs, you know, peanuts,

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,680
and maybe the little ice cream in a helmet.

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
That's about it.

114
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
This guy's eating fruit, you know?

115
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,360
And you know what the problem was,

116
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,720
he was eating it way too long.

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,880
He was like way too into it.

He's like flipping it over, trying to find the good part.

121
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
Oh, look at that, I got a little--

122
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,640
It's like, dude, that $0.39 of bag, let it go.

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
Grab another one.

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
It's fruit, Frederick.

125
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,400
Jeez.

126
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,320
This is embarrassing.

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,440
I was in the hotel tonight, and there's coming down here.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,480
And I got on the elevator, and there

129
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,360
were other people on the elevator.

130
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,880
But then the elevator stopped at my floor,

131
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,720
so I did that move to the front of the elevator.

132
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,360
But then the doors didn't open right away.

133

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Come on, open up, open up.

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
This looks really bad.

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
I look really bad. You're like, "You just, "Oh God,

You look foolish.

141
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
I always get embarrassed on elevators.

142
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
First of all, I always expected to go right to my floor.

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
I don't know why. I'm always expecting the lobby

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
and I always get out too quick.

Now I'm too embarrassed to go back.

No, I want the basement.

I need a towel bin.

I need a towel bin.

158

I don't like that.

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,880
You can tell the chatter people too.

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
They're very happy people.

182
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,640
They're excited to be wherever they are.

183
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
They usually know everybody's name.

184
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,520
Also, usually, Jinklin' change.

185
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,780
Oh, yeah, I'm a...

186
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,780
How the hell's it going there, if I can't get you?

187
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,020
Hey, don't have any, man. What's going on?

188
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,280
It's gonna say, uh, "That's something getting in the day."

189
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Huh? The weather's...

190
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,780
[shouting]

191
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,180
Oh, crap. He's coming to me.

192
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,280
He is coming to me any second.

193
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,520
[laughter]

194
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I tried to look busy, you know?

195
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,820
But I'm online at the bank.

196
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,520
I don't know how you look busy online at the bank, you know?

197
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,520
He's like, "Maybe if I look like I have to go to the bathroom,

198
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
he won't talk to me, you know?"

199
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,020
[laughter]

200
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:30,020
[laughter]

201
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,020
All right, it's working, but now I have to go to the bathroom.

202
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
[laughter]

203
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,020
I have a whole new set of problems now.

204
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,020
[laughter]

205
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
I don't enjoy the bank.

206
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
I hate going to the bank.

207
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
I'm always in a rush when I go to the bank.

208
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
I'm never prepared either.

209
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,020
I never have one of those checking deposit slips on me.

210
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,620
You have to fill it out there.

211
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,460
You start filling it out.

212
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
You see someone else walking the bank?

213
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,700
You have that little anxiety attack?

214
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,060
You know, you're like, "Oh, man."

215
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,160
(audience laughing)

216
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,460
No, no, no, no.

217
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
(audience laughing)

218
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,300
No, no, no.

219
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,140
No, drop the pen.

220
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,420
No, no, drop it.

221
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,260
No.

222
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,100
Drop the pen, lady!

223
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,260
(audience laughing)

224
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,780
No, I'm not gonna be laughing in line

225
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,500
'cause I'm having a problem spelling 13, okay?

226
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
(audience laughing)

227
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,020
I hate being the only one in the bank, too.

228
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,540
That sucks.

229
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
You still got to walk through the ropes.

230
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
(audience laughing)

231
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,040
How smart do you feel then, right?

232
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
Hey!

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,620
(audience laughing)

234
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
Yeah, hi.

235
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,520
Go around for, okay, all right.

236
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,020
I'm gonna make it deposit when I get to the front area.

237
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,520
That's what I'm talking about.

238
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,620
I'm talking to you in a minute.

239
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,020
I'll talk to you in a minute.

240
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,100
(audience laughing)

241
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,560
This is, all right, yeah.

242
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,320
They should have a guy handing out cups of water.

243
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,360
All right, thank you.

244
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,000
All right, good.

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,300
There better be a hunk of cheese at the end of this maze.

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
I'll tell you that later.

247
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,140
[LAUGHTER]

248
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,780
I didn't realize this either, but there's

249
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,860
a line on the floor at the end of the ropes

250
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,480
that you're not allowed to cross unless the bank teller nod

251
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,460
you over.

252
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,260
If you've ever walked right up to him, they freak out.

253
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,580
Right?

254
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,080
Hey, how you doing?

255
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,020
Let's start getting back.

256
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,740
Start getting back.

257
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
You can't come up here yet.

258
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,380
I am not ready.

259
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
So we're busy.

260
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,180
We will not you over when we are ready to go.

261
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,180
(audience laughing)

262
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,480
(audience laughing)

263
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,740
It's even worse at the airport.

264
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
We go to the airport, there's like a million ticket agents

265
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,040
lined up for like a quarter mile long.

266
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,780
I don't like being the next online there.

267
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,060
This way too much pressure there.

268
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,700
Everybody's pumped up, they're all going on vacation,

269
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,580
they're all looking at you.

270
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,420
Hey man, you're next.

271
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Yeah, I know, next shut the hell up.

272
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,260
I know, you're all worried.

273
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,260
(audience laughing)

274
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,740
My luggage, you're all ready.

275
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,980
I know where it's going, right?

276
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
And the ticket agent people are very impatient, right?

277
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,480
Next, I'll take the next part, since are you?

278
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,320
Next, right over here.

279
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,920
So I'll take you right over here, sir.

280
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
No, no, no.

281
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,760
Sir, right over here.

282
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,840
OK, I don't freaking see you.

283
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,160
I don't know where you are.

284
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
I don't know where you are.

285
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,800
Everybody's pointing.

286
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,640
It's over there.

287
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
It's going there.

288
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,140
I don't even know.

289
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,640
Where do I go?

290
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
Where do I go?

291
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Over there, it's on you.

292
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,140
That's all I had.

293
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,880
I didn't know.

294
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,140
I don't know.

295
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,880
I don't know where to go.

296
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,380
So I'm looking right at you.

297
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,080
OK?

298
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,680
That's not helping me.

299
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
[LAUGHTER]

300
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
(audience cheering)

301
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:24,620
Marco!

302
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,620
(audience laughing)

303
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,700
Then you're so pissed off by the time you get up there,

304
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,860
you don't wanna go on vacation anymore.

305
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,220
Sir, did you pack your own bags?

306
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,700
Nine in a rainy and guy named Phil

307
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,340
planned to bomb in my ass.

308
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,340
(audience laughing)

309
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:49,480
I love the questions at the airport because they make you feel real intelligent.

310
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,800
Sir, do you know what's in your luggage?

311
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,800
[laughter]

312
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,800
[laughter]

313
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
No.

314
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,800
I tied a sock around my eyes and I packed with my feet.

315
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm thinking hot dogs and gunpowder, that's probably probably it.

316
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,400
I like when the ticket agent tells you their job too.

317
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,400
They give you like a play-by-play of what they're doing.

318
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,500
It's like you care, you don't need you, you don't know what they're talking about.

319
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
I was like late for a flight and I gave her my ticket.

320
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,400
I was like, "Here, can you take care of this, please?"

321
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,700
She's like, "Hah!"

322
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Let me see what I can do.

323
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay, your ticket is a code fair basis red.

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
[ Laughter ]

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,300
Now what I can try to do it, I can try to punch it in as a --

326
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,800
let me see if this works here.

327
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,500
Backspace, backspace, semi-colon, capital, [inaudible]

328
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
No, see it's not accepting it, okay?

329
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Because your ticket is a T-151-6 as it stands right now.

330
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
[ Laughter ]

331
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now what we can try to make is a T615411, but we will receive whatever!

332
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I gotta get to the big apple, Seth start moving along!

333
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Susie with the wings and the hair and a bun and I'm a vest!

334
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Punch it in and shut off!

335
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I hate when you're online with like a lot of luggage.

336
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That stinks and then the line only moves like four feet.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Right here.

338
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
[laughter]

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thanks, thanks.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, I got it. I got it. I got it.

341
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think you're okay. We're good.

342
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

343
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
[laughter]

344
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Ooh, it's a lot of luggage for a little amount of space, isn't it?

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
[applause]

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, we're moving again. We're going again.

347
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We're going again. We're going again.

348
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
[applause]

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sweating a little bit tonight.

350
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
When you're big, you don't need a reason to sweat.

351
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You don't, right?

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
My friends cannot grab a hold of this concept.

353
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come up to me all the time.

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Jase!

355
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Tell you what you do.

356
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You jump and rope in the attic?

357
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
All right.

358
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Peeled an orange.

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Got an hour ago.

360
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why, what's up?

361
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What's up?

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,400
I love air conditioning. I had it growing up

363
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,240
I had an air conditioner growing up, but I had one of those dads who wouldn't use it all the time

364
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Very selective about today dad, please

365
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:06,660
They break out that big oscillating fan for the whole family

366
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,240
Not a horrible invention that is like waiting for a bus, right?

367
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,880
Man, when does that cold air gonna get here?

368
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,980
(groaning)

369
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:24,080
But that was refreshing, right?

370
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,920
That felt good.

371
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,760
(groaning)

372
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,600
That wasn't right.

373
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,280
Listen, no, I mean, I was on the phone with somebody today

374
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,040
trying to get a phone number from that person

375
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,120
and write it down, but they didn't have phone number rhythm

376
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,440
and that pissed me off.

377
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm talking about phone number rhythm, especially if there's like an area code involved like two one two

378
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,280
BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM

379
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,940
That is the rhythm I think we're all familiar with

380
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,960
This guy had no clue. I was like, okay, hand give me the number. He's like, "I had two one two nine

381
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,320
15, 8, 11, 6, 4, 2, 5, 7, 2.

382
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,240
Did you throw in your zip code?

383
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,600
'Cause I got a lot of extra numbers over here.

384
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
I have extra.

385
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,640
I can almost start a new number.

386
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,200
What do you got?

387
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Start again from the top.

388
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,840
(audience cheering)

389
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,320
They really screw you up on the last four numbers.

390
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,440
That's where they get you.

391
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000
5, 5, 5, 6,

392
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
Team 41.

393
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Dude, I already wrote the sex.

394
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,160
I made the dash too close. I can't shimmy the one in my mouth.

395
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,040
Forget you.

396
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,040
You know what else it noise me?

397
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,240
People even slow ass boring messages on my machine.

398
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Unbelievable. Yeah, you come home late at night.

399
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,240
You got to go to the bathroom. You're like, "Oh, look at this. I got a message."

400
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Oh, this could be important. I better check it out now.

401
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
[Booing]

402
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
[Booing]

403
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Kevin has it going, man.

404
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:32,240
It's Tim Duffy from "Work." What's going on, man?

405
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
And...

406
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
(sighs)

407
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Anyways, give me a call back if you get a chance.

408
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,240
I will be, uh...

409
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,240
Well, you know what, if you call at 9/15,

410
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
I should be back.

411
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Actually, anything I have to 9/18, I'll be home.

412
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Give me a call.

413
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
I'm at...

414
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
(indistinct)

415
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
...to buy.

416
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,640
(audience laughing)

417
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,480
This is great.

418
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,120
Now I gotta play the whole Tim Duffy message again.

419
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,320
(audience laughing)

420
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,760
From the top to try to get the number at 100 miles an hour.

421
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,120
That's fun when you're hunched over your machine

422
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,720
with like an index card and a little pet--

423
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,560
(audience laughing)

424
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,840
(mumbles)

425
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
I got nothing on that pass.

426
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,000
I got absolutely nothing.

427
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,160
I got nothing.

428
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,000
(audience laughing)

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,960
Three thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts,

430
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
five thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts, five thoughts.

431
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,560
I got a six, four blanks of four and then I'm out.

432
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,400
I'm out again.

433
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't know what to do.

434
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
(mumbles)

435
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
I got a freaking G.

436
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,280
I got a J. Timmy gave me a J.

437
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,480
(audience laughing)

438
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,320
So many things like that annoy me.

439
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,480
This annoyed me too, 'cause little things

440
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,520
will make me happy as well.

441
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
You know, like I was going through,

442
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,080
I think it was like a taco bell, it was late at night.

443
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,920
And I'm going through the drive-throw

444
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,040
and the guy was like, okay, 7, 12, pull around.

445
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,360
And I got excited 'cause I had exact change.

446
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,000
So I'm like, that'll make me happy.

447
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,320
But then I went to hand it to him,

448
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,600
and I dropped a dime between the seats.

449
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,640
I was like, "Mother!"

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,760
Now I gotta do this move for 20 minutes.

451
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh, my God, come on.

452
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, come on, man.

453
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,280
Oh, come on.

454
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,640
Oh, I can see the freaking ridges, I can see 'em.

455
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,800
So you're gonna have to pull up.

456
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,760
I'm gonna have to tell you to shut up, Anthony.

457
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,760
(audience laughing)

458
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,940
(upbeat music)

459
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,940
(audience cheering)

460
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,940
That's good.

461
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,740
This is all signs, it's all signs to me.

462
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,420
I gotta get in shape, I gotta do that.

463
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,660
I do, I either gotta get in shape

464
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,540
or hope ponchos come back in style.

465
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,220
(audience laughing)

466
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,260
I don't like weight loss advice

467
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,020
'cause you get weight loss advice from like everybody.

468
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Everybody thinks they got the secret.

469
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,180
People come in up to me all the time.

470
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,620
You know what you got to do?

471
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,460
You got a chushu-girless gum.

472
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,020
That's your problem right there.

473
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,060
Yeah, 'cause my ass got fat from bazooka.

474
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,260
That's where I veered right there.

475
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,500
(audience laughing)

476
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
You ever get weight loss advice from someone bigger than you?

477
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
(audience laughing)

478
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,300
You know what you got to do?

479
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,900
Yeah, not listen to your fat or ass for starters.

480
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,780
(audience laughing)

481
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,540
And then it comes down to my fitness goals

482
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,880
are different than most people.

483
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,820
That's it.

484
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,660
That's what I've assessed.

485
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,500
Seriously, that's it.

486
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,020
Because most people want to lose enough weight

487
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,580
so that they look good in the bathing suit

488
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,980
or they want to lower their cholesterol.

489
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,300
I just want to lose enough so that my stomach doesn't jiggle

490
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,460
when I brush my teeth.

491
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,660
(audience laughing)

492
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,500
That's it.

493
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,940
Then it's just maintenance from there on out.

494
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,940
(audience laughing)

495
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,980
Look, you notice I have an emotional attachment to food.

496
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,020
I get excited when my food's like coming at a restaurant.

497
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,860
Do you get a little pumped up?

498
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,860
I could be talking to someone and then you see it coming out of the corner of your eye.

499
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,860
I have like a little party in my head.

500
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
I'm a...

501
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Fresh, you're not sure.

502
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
You got to make sure you recognize an item that you ordered.

503
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Oh, yeah, the onion fritters. Okay.

504
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
And you got to act like you're in the conversation.

505
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,860
Really, you lost your job. That's horrible.

506
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,860
Oh, oh.

507
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Yes.

508
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Then when it finally does arrive, you just act surprised.

509
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
Whoa, foods here. I didn't even know.

510
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,860
That's great. All right. Well, I guess we should eat now.

511
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:27,860
I just love fast food. I can't get enough of it. You know, I love McDonald's.

512
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,860
I can't eat it, but the problem is I'm in my 30s now. I can't eat it like I used to.

513
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,860
You know, I was in high school. I could eat like three big Macs, finish out the day like a hummingbird.

514
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,860
I had one big Mac the other day. I felt like a grizzly bear that got shot in the ass like a senator of darkness.

515
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
[laughter]

516
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
[laughter]

517
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
[snoring]

518
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,860
[snoring]

519
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
[snoring]

520
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,860
[snoring]

521
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,860
[snoring]

522
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Sir, you can't wait out. It's a McDonald's.

523
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,860
[snoring]

524
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
[snoring]

525
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,860
[applause]

526
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,460
(audience applauding)

527
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,500
Can't be in good shape when you wanna take a nap,

528
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,140
halfway through your big mag, right?

529
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,140
(audience laughing)

530
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:31,580
So they tell me to keep active, that's it.

531
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,100
Keep active, go out, keep active, do what you gotta do,

532
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,140
but keep moving.

533
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,220
So I'm trying different stuff.

534
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,620
Went down to Florida for a little bit, did some water skiing.

535
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,980
I'm gonna be try water skiing, I tried water skiing

536
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
for the first time in my life.

537
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,820
Anybody do it?

538
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,580
(audience applauding)

539
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
You like it?

540
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,420
Yeah, I didn't like it.

541
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,980
A lot of work's like, nah, that much fun actually.

542
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,260
(audience laughing)

543
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,780
I didn't know how much work was involved.

544
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,000
You gotta put the big vest on,

545
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,820
you gotta get in the water, put your skis on,

546
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,060
put your gloves on, grab that handle,

547
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,780
straighten out that rope, brace yourself.

548
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,540
You're like, okay, I'm ready, go!

549
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,820
Boom, I'm down.

550
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,900
(audience laughing)

551
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,940
They gotta pull the boat around,

552
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,700
they gotta locate my bathing suits, yeah.

553
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
(audience laughing)

554
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,700
I got it, I got it.

555
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
I got it.

556
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
She was on the inside, I got her.

557
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,700
I got her, stop looking, I got it.

558
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,700
I wasn't the brightest either,

559
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,700
because I was like the only guy going for the first time.

560
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
Everybody else they all knew what they were doing.

561
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,700
That's kind of discouraging when you can actually hear them on the boat.

562
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,700
[ Laughter ]

563
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,700
[ Sighs ]

564
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
[ Laughter ]

565
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
This sucks. He's down again.

566
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
[ Laughter ]

567
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I didn't invite him. You invited him.

568
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
[ Laughter ]

569
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
And they turn around. They try to help you out.

570
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
[ Sighs ]

571
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
Try -- Look, try and stand up!

572
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,700
[ Laughter ]

573
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Oh, is that the idea?

574
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
[ Laughter ]

575
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
I thought I was supposed to be dragged through the water

576
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,700
with my mouth open!

577
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
Stand up!

578
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,700
[laughter]

579
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Stand up, up!

580
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
[laughter]

581
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
[applause]

582
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,700
[applause]

583
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
Thank you, sir.

584
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
[applause]

585
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,700
[applause]

586
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,700
[applause]

587
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
That's the worst part about it,

588
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,700
because after you wipe out,

589
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
you're just floating there in that water,

590
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,700
waiting for your friends to circle around and pick you up.

591
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
You ever been way out there just?

592
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:48,700
I don't like this at all.

593
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,540
No.

594
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,540
(audience laughing)

595
00:24:52,540 --> 00:25:05,660
This is embarrassing too.

596
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,920
I found out I scream exactly the same

597
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,860
if a great white is like gonna attack me.

598
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,160
Or if a piece of sea we touches my foot.

599
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
(audience laughing)

600
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,160
(audience laughing)

601
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,040
There's a moment I want back right there.

602
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,340
Get me in the boat!

603
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,500
(audience laughing)

604
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,340
It's a matter of Yucky Toes!

605
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,680
(audience laughing)

606
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
I'm touching it.

607
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
(audience laughing)

608
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,260
(upbeat music)

609
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:41,480
Just be honest with people.

610
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,240
If you don't know what you're doing like in a sport

611
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,000
or you're just starting, be honest.

612
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,560
You know, hey, I've never worn a skin before and I suck.

613
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Should I go?

614
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,600
No, no, you shouldn't.

615
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
All right, thanks for the honesty.

616
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,000
Appreciate it.

617
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,120
Like, I went on vacation once.

618
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,800
I met up with a bunch of people and they were like, hey,

619
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,400
you want to go jet skiing tomorrow.

620
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
And I never been jet skiing in my life.

621
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,080
And I should have said that.

622
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,520
But I was like, yeah, I'll go.

623
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,040
I'm good.

624
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,640
They're like, all right, great.

625
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,520
Meet us here tomorrow.

626
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,160
So I meet in there the next day.

627
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,640
They all had their own jet skis.

628
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,960
They're like, where's your jet skate?

629
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Oh, I forgot, I forgot it. I forgot mine.

630
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Now I got a rent one, which is even worse,

631
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
'cause you get a piece of garbage when you rent.

632
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
And they're all bragging about theirs, right?

633
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Yeah, it's a Kawasaki KZ-9000-Wave Humper.

634
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Got the Humper, huh? Cool. Yeah, I got a...

635
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
I got a gray one. I'll be on the gray one.

636
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,960
It says rental with the big number eight on the back.

637
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,960
I'll be riding the bowling shoe out there. I'll be on the shoe.

638
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,960
They'll take off the like, "Eh, yeah! They're like gunning! I'm like, "All right!"

639
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
[whimpering]

640
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,960
[whimpering]

641
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
[whimpering]

642
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
[whimpering]

643
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
She's packed!

644
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
[whimpering]

645
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,960
You know, I'm embarrassing it is to wipe out going zero?

646
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
[whimpering]

647
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
No.

648
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,960
[whimpering]

649
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,960
(audience laughs)

650
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,560
- It's a trick, I'm doing a trick, this is cool.

651
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,560
(audience laughs)

652
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,440
Once my underwear got wet too,

653
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,400
that was it, the day was over for me.

654
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,040
They all had professional jet ski bathing suits on.

655
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,040
I didn't have that, I had an old pair of cutoff jeans

656
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,740
like cheap underwear I bought myself.

657
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,800
I have no idea what I'm doing.

658
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
I buy underwear.

659
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,640
Hey, look at this.

660
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,280
$38 pairs for a dollar.

661
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,400
[LAUGHTER]

662
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,800
Then I take two steps out of my house.

663
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I feel like I have a tangled hammock between my legs.

664
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,480
[LAUGHTER]

665
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,440
Oh, wow.

666
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,400
Now I know why so many for so little.

667
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,880
It's pretty obvious now.

668
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720
This is not good times.

669
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,560
[LAUGHTER]

670
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,160
This is rough.

671
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,880
I have an underwear situation here.

672
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,080
Hate that when you get an underwear thing.

673
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,360
Worst than having your own underwear situation is watching someone

674
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,880
else deal with their underwear situation.

675
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,360
You ever see a guy trying to pick the underwear out of his ass?

676
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,320
Without using his hands like he's fooling anybody?

677
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,760
Hey, how do you-- I think it's over here in Macy's.

678
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,960
I'm not sure we'll take a look though.

679
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,460
Yeah.

680
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,960
[APPLAUSE]

681
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,960
(audience cheering)

682
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:47,300
Dude, what the hell was that?

683
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,500
(audience laughing)

684
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,180
Would you turn into Elvis for a second?

685
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,020
What the heck?

686
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,540
What is this move?

687
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,140
You're not fooling anybody with your one cheek slide

688
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,980
or how to?

689
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,820
(audience laughing)

690
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,660
What's up, man?

691
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,420
Everybody walks like this.

692
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,060
Yeah, hey.

693
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,900
Hey Rob.

694
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,900
How's it going man? Good to see you. Good.

695
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,900
Alright, skipping her. Skipping up to the side.

696
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:19,900
So hard. Relationships are tough. It's tough to work it out with two.

697
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Because we're two different animals. We really are. It's difficult.

698
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,900
You know, and I just feel like sometimes I can't do anything right.

699
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,900
You don't know how to move. You don't know how to work things.

700
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,500
So I just try to survive. That's all I try to do in a relationship.

701
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,600
Here's a little trick that I learned.

702
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,100
Recalling a little something that's very unimportant at the moment.

703
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,600
At a later date, we'll do wonders.

704
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,800
Remember one little thing, it'll freak her out. I swear.

705
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,000
Like I had dinner with her at her sister's house,

706
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
and I remembered one little thing, and I waited because it was going to come up sometime

707
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and she brought it up. She was like, "You know the other day, remember last week

708
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
when we were having dinner at my sister's house?"

709
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh yeah, yeah, when you had the little butterfly clip in your head with the sparkles on it.

710
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You remember.

711
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,240
(audience laughing)

712
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,480
The hearts are a member.

713
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,940
(audience laughing)

714
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,820
I always remember lovely little nuggets about you.

715
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,820
(audience laughing)

716
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,460
You know, my girlfriend's a little off though.

717
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,620
I don't know.

718
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,220
Yeah, she's a little bit off and I'm thinking,

719
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,120
"Hey, look, hey, I'm, believe me,

720
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,660
"I am not the smartest guy in the world

721
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,560
"and I don't claim to be by far,

722
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
"but this was a little weird.

723
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,900
"I was on the phone with her and I traveled,

724
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,900
"you know, I'm here in New York now

725
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,660
"and she was in LA, you know, at the time,

726
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,820
And that's where she lives.

727
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,260
And I was on the phone with her and she was like, "God, I miss you."

728
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,860
And I was like, "Yeah, I know I miss you too."

729
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,860
She's like, "I wish I could be there with you."

730
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,060
And I was like, "Yeah, I believe I wish she could be there with me too."

731
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,860
Then it got like silent for like a beat.

732
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
And I got like worried.

733
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
I was like, "Oh, she's thinking about them here."

734
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
[laughter]

735
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
[sighs]

736
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
If I only had a magic carpet.

737
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
[laughter]

738
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
[laughter]

739
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,860
[laughter]

740
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,860
I'd be there in like two hours.

741
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:24,860
What?

742
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Did you just say magic carpet?

743
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,860
We're agreeing that she's a magic carpet.

744
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,860
How do you get to, what are you going to lay over in Dallas?

745
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,860
What the...

746
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,860
How do you get two hours with a magic carpet?

747
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
Where's this?

748
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Well, I don't want to go too fast.

749
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,860
I don't want to fall off.

750
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,860
Alrighty then.

751
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Can't go to the movies with her.

752
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,860
Can't enjoy the movies anymore.

753
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,860
Because she sees every movie that comes out right away

754
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
with her friends first.

755
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
And if she likes that particular movie,

756
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
she wants to see it again with me.

757
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
Yeah, she wants to see it.

758
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,940
Yeah, this is great for every five seconds now.

759
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,900
Hey, hey, oh god, watch this part.

760
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,020
Watch this part.

761
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,940
What the hell was I doing?

762
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,940
Hey.

763
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,940
[LAUGHTER]

764
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:24,220
Hey, look at that.

765
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,140
I can make a dog.

766
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
I got a dog.

767
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,020
I got a dog going.

768
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,620
I'm sitting in a chair facing a tremendous screen.

769
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,620
Hey, watch this part.

770
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
Okay

771
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,920
She got mad at me she gave me an elbow she I mean really watch

772
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:57,140
I love the movie food

773
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,740
Popcorn is the food you should have in the movie that's the classic movie food popcorn

774
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,260
But I only like it in the movies. I don't like it anywhere else. I don't like when they stick it like sports bars

775
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,900
You know and they stick it in front of you and then like dance clubs do then you munch on an eff like 20 minutes

776
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,260
You see something you like hey? How you doing? Yeah, it's just a hanging out over here my buddies and stuff

777
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:44,260
[laughter]

778
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,920
pretty luck, right? When you own those shells,

779
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,760
spot welded way on the back of your tongue.

780
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
(audience laughing)

781
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,960
Then we finish up at the movie, I get back in my car,

782
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,400
I go to unlock her door and she lifts the handle

783
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
at the exact same time.

784
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,560
I try to unlock the door and they offset each other.

785
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,920
You've been stuck in that little tug of war

786
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,760
for about an hour.

787
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,760
(audience laughing)

788
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
Can't give me a second.

789
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,600
(audience laughing)

790
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:27,600
(singing in foreign language)

791
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
(audience cheering)

792
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
- SIGUR-HASS on the curb, I will come around and leach in!

793
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,100
(audience laughing)

794
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,600
- What the hell goes through her mind?

795
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I have no idea. Can I get in there?

796
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,800
I don't know how about now, no, now,

797
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
♪ I'm not in time ♪

798
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
♪ I can't get in harder ♪

799
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,800
(audience laughs)

800
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
(upbeat music)

801
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
- This is good, this is fun.

802
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
(audience laughs)

803
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,800
- This is good, this is fun.

804
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,800
(audience laughs)

805
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,800
- This is good, this is fun.

806
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
(audience laughs)

807
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
This is good. This is fun.

808
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,400
I got a card from my girlfriend.

809
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,300
For an anniversary.

810
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,800
We've been dating eight months though. It's a little weird.

811
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,300
She's starting to spring anniversaries on me.

812
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
You know, you're walking the door, you have no clue. Do you know what today is?

813
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,300
Oh.

814
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,800
I'm gonna say Sunday, but I'm wrong, right?

815
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,800
(audience laughing)

816
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,320
Two weeks ago today was the first time

817
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,020
you kissed me at a jiffy loop.

818
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,480
(audience laughing)

819
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,720
I forgot to check my sticker.

820
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,560
I apologize.

821
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,600
(audience laughing)

822
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,320
I don't love cards.

823
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,120
I don't think I speak for most, every man.

824
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,920
(audience laughing)

825
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,020
Right?

826
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,160
Did you know that it's really long romantic card, you like,

827
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
(audience laughing)

828
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,500
This is like homework.

829
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
This is...

830
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
(audience laughing)

831
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,240
It's tough, too, 'cause we won't finish him.

832
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm gonna be honest, we don't finish the cards we get.

833
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,240
We don't read them.

834
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,080
We don't read them.

835
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,920
I'll be honest.

836
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,140
And it's hard 'cause when a woman hand you a card,

837
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,080
they stay right there.

838
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
They lock on you, right?

839
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
They get in like a horse stance.

840
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,780
Like, "Oh, I wanna see if it hits you emotionally,

841
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,120
"like it hit me."

842
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,020
(audience laughing)

843
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,860
Men don't give cards.

844
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,620
We don't give cards.

845
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
There you go.

846
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,120
Guy gives a card, it's like he's delivering mail.

847
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,360
All right, here I got your card.

848
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Whatever, I don't care.

849
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
But we don't read 'em, we don't finish 'em, we don't.

850
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,360
We all do the same thing, we open 'em in front of ya.

851
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Right, we put on the fake smile.

852
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Hey.

853
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,360
[laughter]

854
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
And we give that little head bob to let you know we're finished.

855
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
All right, yeah.

856
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,360
[laughter]

857
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,360
You think we're reading it, we're actually going one Mississippi, two Mississippi.

858
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Oh, no, no.

859
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Yeah.

860
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,360
I'm never going to throw out a card either,

861
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
because if it was up to us, we'd throw it out pretty much

862
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
immediately, right?

863
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
All right, thank you.

864
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,360
[LAUGHTER]

865
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,360
What are you doing?

866
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Is it going to hang it up?

867
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
I want to hang it up for you.

868
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I'm going to take a check it out.

869
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,360
A little bit. I like checking it out.

870
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Women love cards though.

871
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
They love it.

872
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
My girlfriend love it.

873
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Yeah, god.

874
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
You haven't given your wife a girlfriend a card out of the blue,

875
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,520
They just freak out. They do. Hey honey, here I picked up some milk and oh yeah, I got you a card

876
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:55,480
Apparently not not I didn't

877
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,740
(audience laughing)

878
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,560
This means you were thinking of me.

879
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,420
(audience laughing)

880
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,660
How long go we are planning this like a month?

881
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,460
(audience laughing)

882
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,300
Yes.

883
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
(audience laughing)

884
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,420
Which is another lie, right guys?

885
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,940
Bike cars, there's five minutes before we give them to you.

886
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,500
We fill them out at a stop sign, right?

887
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah, I love you, I love you.

888
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,300
(audience laughing)

889
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,700
Couple exos on the bottom, underline a couple words, right?

890
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,060
Then we throw out the little brown bag

891
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,540
in the receipt 'cause that's evidence.

892
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,180
you don't want to get in court with that.

893
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,980
I've been in the car.

894
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,260
You get back in there with your girlfriend.

895
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,540
Five minutes later unexpectedly,

896
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,620
you didn't expect her to be there.

897
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,460
And she finds it.

898
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,100
You idiot, you bought this car 21 minutes ago.

899
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,260
And you got a butter finger.

900
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,500
First, you fat ass.

901
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
[LAUGHTER]

902
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:46,860
Look at this car about the car.

903
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
They don't represent real life.

904
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,940
That's the problem.

905
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,700
These cars get a ridiculous.

906
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:59,260
the big sunset with the two deer drinking out of the pond, creating the ripples of water.

907
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
That's not our life.

908
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,620
It should say, "I'm five-year-old fat."

909
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,620
See in the kitchen in ten minutes.

910
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
[laughter]

911
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,420
The cards are important to them, though, because more importantly than just getting a card

912
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,420
is getting the right card.

913
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,660
It's got to be like a mood thing and everything.

914
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,420
It's got to be the right card for the right moment.

915
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,860
They really put their time and effort into getting cards.

916
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,700
You ever been stuck behind a woman at Hallmark?

917
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,620
When they're shopping for a card, it's like a chess move to their right.

918
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,620
(laughter)

919
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,620
