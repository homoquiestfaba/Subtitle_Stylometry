1
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:07,094
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:25,298
(dramatic instrumental music)

3
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,790
(intense instrumental music)

4
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,488
- Well here's number six.

5
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,738
(clapping)

6
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,417
- She's the last, the sixth one.

7
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,626
- How the hell you know that?

8
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,459
- [Woman In Gray] Don't you?

9
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,410
- Come on babe, you
gotta drink a little bit.

10
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,493
There you go.

11
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,085
It's okay, just relax.

12
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,342
- Please...

13
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:48,724
Can someone tell me what's--

14
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,940
- No, we can't tell you what's going on.

15
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,340
- Okay, okay, just hold on.

16
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,419
I've already done this a few times today,

17
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,318
so I think I'm getting the hang of it.

18
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:56,629
Let me guess...

19
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,250
You were somewhere normal,
doing something normal.

20
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,280
All of a sudden you got this...

21
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,029
This thing in your brain.

22
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,269
Tells you to drop whatever you're doing,

23
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,560
get here as fast as you can,

24
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,570
any way that you can.

25
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,440
When the fact is, you don't
even know where here is.

26
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,032
Or that you had gotten
where you were going

27
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,432
until you got here.

28
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:19,245
And you don't know why you
did, or why you're here,

29
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,947
or who any of us are.

30
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,780
Am I right?

31
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,779
- Yes but--

32
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,848
- Multiply times five and
that's exactly the same deal

33
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,098
with all of us.

34
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,317
Hold on, I can tell you
something else that you knew.

35
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:34,709
There'd be six of us here,
which means you're the last.

36
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:38,347
Oh, something else I can
personally vouch for...

37
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:40,248
You can't leave.

38
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,557
- I don't understand.

39
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:42,917
- There's a fuckin' understatement.

40
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,939
- We've all tried it, okay?

41
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,707
Around 100 feet from
here, you hit this like...

42
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,549
Invisible wall, and it's like...

43
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:55,937
You're walking through
mud, only there's no mud.

44
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,597
It's like a fuckin' nightmare.

45
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,288
- Another five feet,
you can't move an inch.

46
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,836
Just come running back to this damn cabin.

47
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,156
- Yeah, and Rozzer there has the record.

48
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,179
She got a good three feet
further than the rest of us.

49
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,012
- So...

50
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,101
Now's your shot.

51
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,470
Go head and go for it if you want to.

52
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,670
- Thanks.

53
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,139
- Oh, and let me make the introductions.

54
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,728
My name's Paul.

55
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,798
And I was working at my
cousin Arnie's garage,

56
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:21,030
middle of some guy's transmission.

57
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,408
Suddenly I get this view of
a cabin in the mountains.

58
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:27,630
Next thing you know, I'm on my way.

59
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,899
And that big guy that looks
like a football player,

60
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,219
that's Len.

61
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,330
- Yeah, except I think
sports are bullshit.

62
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,998
- Yeah, right.

63
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,296
Len was...

64
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,518
What, where the hell were you?

65
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,777
- I was in engaged in
some very serious research

66
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:41,879
with a young lady friend of mine named...

67
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,331
What the hell was her name?

68
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:44,819
- Okay, we get the picture.

69
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,659
And that's Tina right there.

70
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,561
She left right in the middle of class

71
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:50,009
at Porter Powell High School.

72
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,649
- God only knows what my mom's thinking.

73
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,260
- [Paul] And that's Roz over there.

74
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,369
- Hi.

75
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:59,489
I was with my art study
group at the national museum.

76
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:00,739
- Hi, I'm Alma.

77
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,551
Alma Groves.

78
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:06,474
I was having lunch at--

79
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,109
- Man, you had lunch?

80
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,955
- Len was obviously
satisfying the wrong appetite

81
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,738
before he got the summons.

82
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:14,138
Alma.

83
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:14,971
Okay.

84
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,656
Oh, and that inscrutably
silent fella over there

85
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,136
in the corner...

86
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:20,256
That's Robert.

87
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:22,427
We don't know what the fuck he was doing.

88
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:23,344
- Yeah, so.

89
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,347
Introduction is over.

90
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:27,987
Now what?

91
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:29,568
- What, it isn't up to me.

92
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,606
- There's something else I could tell you.

93
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:35,067
Whatever is going to happen,
it's gonna happen fast.

94
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,638
He's watering the pump.

95
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:39,368
Nobody's been in this place for...

96
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,701
100 years or so.

97
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:44,907
There's nothing edible here
unless you're a termite.

98
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,598
And none of us brought any food.

99
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:47,431
- Wow.

100
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:48,264
(clapping)

101
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:49,097
There he goes again, guys.

102
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:49,976
Thank you, Robert.

103
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:50,967
Something else for us to worry about

104
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,098
that we can't affect to
one fucking centimeter.

105
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,387
- Just something I was thinking about

106
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:56,998
while I was being inscrutably silent.

107
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:58,556
- Good.

108
00:08:58,556 --> 00:08:59,389
Good.

109
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,267
So anyway, Alma.

110
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,289
If you'd like, now's your chance to do

111
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,057
whatever emotional thing you want to.

112
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:05,315
We can break furniture like Len did here

113
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,097
when he got here.

114
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:09,155
Or you can cry like Tina did.

115
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,814
Or you can do that
creepy weird silent thing

116
00:09:10,814 --> 00:09:12,465
that Robert and Roz are pulling.

117
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:16,358
- All this bullshit of talking
without saying anything.

118
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:17,219
That's your strategy.

119
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,117
- Yeah, you got it.

120
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:23,248
- I'll pass on all of
them if you don't mind.

121
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,257
- Where you going?

122
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:28,077
- You invited me to try
and get out of this place.

123
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,244
I'm gonna try.

124
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,939
Is there any direction you haven't tried?

125
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,021
- What do you think?

126
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,531
There's like a magic invisible wall

127
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,010
around part of the place...

128
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,800
But the other part, we can
just walk right through.

129
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,967
- How about through there?

130
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,469
- You should be feeling
that weird feeling by now.

131
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:04,301
- I'm not feeling any
weirder than I was before.

132
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,381
- That's gotta be like 200 feet.

133
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:07,714
- She's still going.

134
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,881
- What are we waitin' for?

135
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:23,027
Hey, you may have actually found a way.

136
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:26,360
- [Len] What the fuck do you call that?

137
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,760
Jesus, more weird shit.

138
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,787
- I didn't think there'd
be that many dead people

139
00:10:29,787 --> 00:10:33,787
out in the middle of
nowhere who needed burying.

140
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,275
- [Tina] What is that?

141
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,547
Is that a totem pole?

142
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:40,686
- [Alma] I don't think they ever carved

143
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,886
totem poles on a stone.

144
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,187
- [Len] Maybe it was
carved to look like that.

145
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,515
- Or maybe all the others were carved

146
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,494
to look like this one.

147
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:50,195
- [Len] What are you talking about?

148
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:53,305
- I don't know, but this thing looks old.

149
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:55,205
A lot older than those graves,

150
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,955
and a lot older than that cabin.

151
00:10:57,955 --> 00:10:59,462
So either someone would have had to have

152
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,001
brought it here,

153
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:03,502
or it was here when they came.

154
00:11:03,502 --> 00:11:05,611
And if it was here when they came...

155
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:09,278
It's been here for a
really long, long time.

156
00:11:10,342 --> 00:11:11,462
- You know what?

157
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,152
I got a great idea.

158
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,031
Let's smash it.

159
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:14,864
- What?

160
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,542
- [Paul] Hey, hold on man.

161
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,531
- You want to destroy something

162
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:26,073
that might be just as old as Stonehenge?

163
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:28,113
- Gee, let me think.

164
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:29,822
Do I give a shit?

165
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,211
No, fuck it.

166
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:32,913
So unless you wanna get stone in your eye,

167
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:36,113
I suggest you back da fuck up.

168
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,696
(loud thunder)

169
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:52,545
- Well I guess that answers
that question, doesn't it.

170
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,014
- What the hell do you
know about this thing?

171
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:54,934
- What do you mean?

172
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:56,405
- What the fuck do you think I mean?

173
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,099
It's a totem pole, Robert.

174
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,534
Do I see any other Indians around?

175
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:01,894
Nope, just you.

176
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:03,863
- Screw you, man.

177
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,272
This thing doesn't belong to any tribe

178
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:06,683
I ever heard of.

179
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,527
Unless it's the fucked up peyote smoker

180
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,701
who a gothic church carver tribe.

181
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:11,960
And second thing...

182
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,050
If it was a fucking Roman column,

183
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,099
everybody around you would
be looking at you funny

184
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:20,200
because your Goddamn
grandparents came from Sicily,

185
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,149
or wherever the hell they came from.

186
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,118
- Man, we're all in the same
deep shit together, okay?

187
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:27,097
Who the hell is gonna know if not you?

188
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:30,337
- Okay paesano, first of all...

189
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:34,347
My tribe the Choctaw, didn't
build any fucking totem poles,

190
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:36,547
with any shapes, size or color.

191
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,179
And second of all...

192
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,303
I can't tell you jack shit until
you know about the Choctaw.

193
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,060
My family hasn't lived in the reservation

194
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,730
in three generations.

195
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,359
Stop coming to me for any
animalistic, shamanistic,

196
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,182
spirit guide bullshit.

197
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,543
Ain't got it.

198
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:53,372
- Yeah, well if you don't know
anything about the Choctaw,

199
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,692
how do you know they
didn't build totem poles?

200
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,732
- Because the Choctaw
live in the Great Plains.

201
00:12:57,732 --> 00:13:00,832
And there aren't any freakin'
trees in the Great Plains.

202
00:13:00,832 --> 00:13:04,402
Better things to do than
carve shit out of granite,

203
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,882
which there wasn't any of
out in the Great Plains.

204
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:08,834
There was basically grass...

205
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,492
Buffalo and buffalo shit.

206
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:15,248
So if you find anything
here carved out of that,

207
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:17,415
then you could come to me.

208
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,789
Any other questions?

209
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:24,451
- I'm going back to the cabin now.

210
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:28,451
I don't like the way that
thing's looking at me.

211
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:53,745
- Guess you found the invisible wall, huh?

212
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:57,412
Just turn around, it
will let you come back.

213
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:03,395
- Just checking the distances.

214
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:05,015
- What do you mean?

215
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,017
- You all figured that the
barrier was a big circle

216
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:11,006
with a cabin at the center.

217
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:12,347
- It's a different shape?

218
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,137
- No, it's a circle.

219
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,667
But the cabin isn't the center.

220
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:19,084
The graveyard is, back there.

221
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:23,477
- So...

222
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:26,817
(drowned out speaking)

223
00:14:26,817 --> 00:14:28,900
- No, it's my first time.

224
00:14:57,566 --> 00:15:00,899
(ominous ambient music)

225
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,013
- There you go.

226
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:15,180
Just call be Daniel Boone.

227
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,344
Shit!

228
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:18,511
Fucking thing.

229
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,112
- You guys, does anybody
have a flashlight?

230
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,791
- Oh, I have um...

231
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,991
It's not a flashlight, it's a key light.

232
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:25,911
But you can--

233
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,828
- I'll take it, thanks.

234
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,082
- Where you going?

235
00:15:31,082 --> 00:15:32,631
- To the outhouse.

236
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,101
- You want me to come with you?

237
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,796
- Do I want you to come with me?

238
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,978
- It might not be a bad idea.

239
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,947
- Yeah, just me being chivalrous.

240
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,916
Come on, I'll guard you while you pee.

241
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,163
- Okay, well then tell me this...

242
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,236
Suppose you do come along and guard me...

243
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,228
What is it exactly
that's gonna happen to me

244
00:15:48,228 --> 00:15:51,608
that by you being there is
gonna stop from happening?

245
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:52,976
- Well you could have
someone out there that--

246
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,536
- Yeah, don't worry I'll
be back in a few minutes.

247
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,869
Just don't leave without me.

248
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,229
- Christ man, I am so hungry.

249
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,469
- Guys used to boil and eat shoe leather

250
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,547
when the food ran out.

251
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:08,949
We'll just eat one another.

252
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:10,858
- Yeah, well I don't think my shoes

253
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:12,588
are made of leather but I
wouldn't mind eating Tina

254
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,421
when she gets back.

255
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,754
(chuckling)

256
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,036
Hey, where'd you get
the soap for the lamp?

257
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:19,245
- There's a big can of it back there,

258
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,607
must've been sitting on the
shelf for about 100 years.

259
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,525
- You mean they had cans
a hundred years ago?

260
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,636
- Yeah, Len.

261
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:27,676
They had cans back in 1900.

262
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,861
- Well pardon fuckin' moi, asshole.

263
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:32,267
It's like not an area
of my expertise, okay?

264
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,946
- Hey, you guys gotta come see this.

265
00:16:34,946 --> 00:16:35,779
Come on.

266
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,353
- [Paul] Any canned corn in here?

267
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,064
- [Roz] No, no food.

268
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:54,075
Look at the floor.

269
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:56,281
Brush the dirt away.

270
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,628
- [Paul] Beautiful.

271
00:16:58,628 --> 00:16:59,948
- [Alma] Do you think it's blood?

272
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:01,107
- Yes, it's human blood.

273
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:01,979
- Shit.

274
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,812
How do you know?

275
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:03,645
- Look.

276
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:08,747
- [Alma] Oh God.

277
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,757
- Okay, so it is human blood.

278
00:17:10,757 --> 00:17:12,499
- That's...

279
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,174
That's some grizzly shit.

280
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:16,688
Thanks for showing us, Roz.

281
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,166
- What do you guys think happened in here?

282
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,976
- [Paul] Hey, don't ask
what you don't wanna know.

283
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:20,957
- What do you mean?

284
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,827
- I mean I got a feeling
if we wait here any longer,

285
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:24,827
it's gonna happen again.

286
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,361
- [Alma] Let's see, catalog.

287
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:32,548
Poor Richard's Almanack.

288
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,381
1899.

289
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:37,747
Les Miserables.

290
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:40,541
- [Paul] You ever see the show?

291
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,458
It's fucking brilliant.

292
00:17:45,836 --> 00:17:47,086
- [Alma] Bible.

293
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:56,415
- So we know who built the cabin.

294
00:17:57,692 --> 00:17:59,275
- March 11th, 1899.

295
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,031
That's strange.

296
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,292
That graveyard looks more
than a hundred years old.

297
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,541
- Yeah, and there sure are more than...

298
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,942
One, two, three, six people in it.

299
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:10,773
Even presuming they all died and the last

300
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,191
dug his own grave and pulled
the dirt in on top of him.

301
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,270
- So they came here to settle or something

302
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,922
and some basically bad shit happened.

303
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,732
- Well that sure sums it up.

304
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,174
- Hey, what time is it?

305
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,132
- What's the matter, you
got some place to go?

306
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:25,313
- No, but how long does
it take a girl to go pee?

307
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,763
- Just let her--

308
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:27,843
- [Len] Depends on how many beers she's--

309
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:30,022
- No, quit fucking around guys.

310
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:30,855
I'm serious.

311
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,613
Has she been gone longer
than it takes or not?

312
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,481
- Well when did she leave?

313
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,231
- Shit, I don't know.

314
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,881
Why don't we go check on her?

315
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,489
I mean she'll probably just...

316
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,572
I better go check on her.

317
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:54,788
Just arming myself.

318
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,356
Do you guys wanna go?

319
00:18:56,356 --> 00:18:57,189
- No.

320
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:01,007
- Okay, well it's a...

321
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,626
It's probably nothing.

322
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:03,709
I'll be back.

323
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,234
(ominous instrumental music)

324
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:42,910
- Jeez.

325
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,018
My God.

326
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,909
- Get lost on the way to the outhouse?

327
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,980
- No, I just came to check on something.

328
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,063
- Check what?

329
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,263
- Look.

330
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,589
Alma Groves.

331
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,916
Is your last name Maglia?

332
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,833
- Yeah, how'd you know?

333
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,584
Look.

334
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:06,268
- What the fuck?

335
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:08,185
How could that thing...

336
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,032
- And over here's Robert.

337
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,782
And Leonard McKinney.

338
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,772
I guess that's Len.

339
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:17,815
- How the hell could
this thing have the date

340
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:20,033
of my birth carved on it?

341
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,364
It's nuts.

342
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:23,633
This thing's ancient.

343
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,133
- This one's mine.

344
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:28,380
Enshrined with the date of death.

345
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,213
- What?

346
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,657
- August 12th.

347
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:40,349
August 12th, 1999.

348
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:44,204
That's tonight.

349
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:45,037
Paul?

350
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:50,243
- Here are their names.

351
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:54,672
John Morgan, Elizabeth
Morgan, Willard Morgan,

352
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:58,755
Eleanor Morgan, John Morgan
Jr., and Jane Morgan.

353
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:00,535
- Yeah.

354
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,133
One big happy family.

355
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:05,750
Well, until that thing with the ax.

356
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,953
So what's the deal here anyway huh?

357
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:09,291
I mean, they came here.

358
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,523
The graveyard was either
here, or partially here,

359
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:13,002
or not here at all.

360
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:15,182
So they built it, or they didn't build it.

361
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:18,323
And then they died or
some died and some left.

362
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:20,182
So my question is this...

363
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:22,015
What does that get us?

364
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:24,861
- What's wrong?

365
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:27,523
- Why didn't we go with him?

366
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,003
- With who?

367
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,003
- With Paul?

368
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:33,022
- Tina doesn't turn up,
he wants to go find her,

369
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:33,938
he asked someone to come with him,

370
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:36,019
it makes perfect sense.

371
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:37,211
Why would we let him go out there alone

372
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,001
if something might be wrong?

373
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,211
Why didn't we go with him?

374
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,090
- I don't know.

375
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,410
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't get it.

376
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,243
What do you mean?

377
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:46,441
- Well what I mean is...

378
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:49,859
- She means that whatever
made us come here

379
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:52,731
and whatever is keeping us from leaving

380
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:54,551
may have made us stay here

381
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,718
and let Paul go out alone.

382
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:58,754
- Shit.

383
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:02,242
(knocking)

384
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:06,888
(intense piano music)

385
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,237
- [Alma] Oh my gosh.

386
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,769
- What the fuck man,
what happened out there?

387
00:22:28,769 --> 00:22:30,168
- Graveyard.

388
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:31,001
Graveyard.

389
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:33,032
It's haunted.

390
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:40,528
(creepy instrumental music)

391
00:22:48,363 --> 00:22:51,603
- What do you mean our names
are in the gravestones?

392
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,873
- It doesn't make any sense.

393
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,394
- Well what the fuck does?

394
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:56,227
You know, if you don't believe me,

395
00:22:56,227 --> 00:22:58,554
go up and check yourselves.

396
00:22:58,554 --> 00:22:59,783
Leonard McKinney.

397
00:22:59,783 --> 00:23:00,616
Right?

398
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:01,903
That's your last name, isn't it.

399
00:23:01,903 --> 00:23:04,542
You didn't tell me, did you?

400
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:05,375
- That's me.

401
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,979
- The dates of our births,
and some of them...

402
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:10,427
The dates of our deaths,
if we can read them.

403
00:23:10,427 --> 00:23:11,579
Some are worn away.

404
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:12,730
- What date?

405
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,759
- What date do you think?

406
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,629
What date do you fucking think?

407
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:15,712
Today's date!

408
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,278
- [Robert] What happened to Tina?

409
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:20,965
- I don't know.

410
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:23,618
When I found her, she
was looking at the stone.

411
00:23:23,618 --> 00:23:25,189
Then I heard something.

412
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,669
It was claws or leather or something.

413
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:31,268
Then I was on the ground, I heard talking.

414
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:34,298
Not screaming, like begging.

415
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:36,705
Then there was blood, she was dead.

416
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:38,723
There was blood everywhere,
it was all over me

417
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:40,587
and that totem pole carving.

418
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,696
It's right on the carving, the top one.

419
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:45,477
And all over its claws and...

420
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:46,678
So I didn't know what to
do, I just grabbed her

421
00:23:46,678 --> 00:23:47,638
and I brought her back here.

422
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:49,668
- You have no idea what happened to her?

423
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,207
What killed her?

424
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:52,040
- [Paul] That's right.

425
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,268
- You were there man, you were
standing right fuckin' there

426
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,375
and you don't know what happened?

427
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,625
- I don't know.

428
00:23:57,527 --> 00:23:58,735
I don't fuckin' know!

429
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:00,124
- And how is that it killed her

430
00:24:00,124 --> 00:24:01,946
and just let you walk away?

431
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:02,996
- I don't know!

432
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:04,636
- Maybe he doesn't know
for the same reason

433
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:07,823
we let him go out there alone.

434
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,423
- Yeah, that's kinda
fuckin' weird isn't it?

435
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:12,034
- You know what's weirder
than anything else?

436
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,073
The fact that when I had woken up...

437
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:13,932
(eerie groaning)

438
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,015
- What the fuck was that?

439
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:21,554
- [Roz] Do you see anything?

440
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,063
- It's too dark.

441
00:24:23,063 --> 00:24:24,311
I can't see a thing.

442
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:26,911
- Okay, well I'm not going out to check.

443
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:29,828
(eerie screeching)

444
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,071
- There's something on the roof.

445
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,321
(growling)

446
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,227
- Totally fucked up.

447
00:24:38,191 --> 00:24:39,798
- She's not alive?

448
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:42,267
- Fucking news flash, she's not alive.

449
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:44,631
- She's saying something.

450
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:46,881
- No Alma, don't check her.

451
00:24:56,543 --> 00:25:00,449
- It's not English, I
can't understand her.

452
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:04,629
- Maybe it's fuckin' dead person language.

453
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,879
(mumbling)

454
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:16,254
- And the season of
blood spilling returns.

455
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:20,407
When the time of the returnings...

456
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:23,373
Comes again.

457
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:26,902
- I thought you didn't know
any of this Indian shit?

458
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,553
- Damn it, I don't.

459
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:31,136
Don't any of you understand it?

460
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:39,398
And then...

461
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,350
In their returning...

462
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:44,979
The first...

463
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,012
Season...

464
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:51,976
Of fire and blood shall come again.

465
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:58,314
The first killer is killed...

466
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:04,371
The first victim has been offered.

467
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,234
The first master...

468
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,112
Has woken up.

469
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,487
Blessing for the killer,

470
00:26:20,807 --> 00:26:22,807
blessing for the victim,

471
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:27,948
blessing for the first master of three.

472
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:32,767
Blessing for the bloody master

473
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,100
who has woken up

474
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,642
and walks through the skies.

475
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:41,486
Blessing for the three masters

476
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:44,236
who have come up out of the earth

477
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,926
in their season of waking up.

478
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:53,801
Blessing for the three
masters of the dead.

479
00:26:57,479 --> 00:27:00,396
(eerie screeching)

480
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,607
- I'm going to check.

481
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:04,440
- You crazy?

482
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,376
Go and check what?

483
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,715
- If it's true.

484
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,477
- Whatever it is man,
take her word for it.

485
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:09,810
Robert, come on.

486
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:14,997
- There goes another one, that's great.

487
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:17,527
You know, I'm staying right here.

488
00:27:17,527 --> 00:27:18,360
- So stay.

489
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,860
- You should stay!

490
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:25,458
Just relax okay, I'm not
gonna hurt you, just relax.

491
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,357
Well try to relax, damn it!

492
00:27:26,357 --> 00:27:28,690
Just try is what I'm saying.

493
00:27:35,642 --> 00:27:39,593
- One of us is dead, one of them is alive.

494
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:41,441
Don't you believe it?

495
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:42,691
- I believe it.

496
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:45,435
- [Robert] Two left.

497
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:47,581
- [Alma] But if there are only three...

498
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:50,532
Why were the six of us summoned?

499
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:52,132
- Didn't you hear?

500
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:56,299
Three to do the dying, and
three to do the killing.

501
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:05,512
- Now tell me this again.

502
00:28:05,512 --> 00:28:07,361
What do you mean it's gone?

503
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,881
- I mean it's gone.

504
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:11,271
It's not on the totem thing anymore.

505
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:14,172
It's vanished, gone, not there anymore.

506
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:16,005
What more don't you...

507
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:19,681
What I actually mean is the God damn thing

508
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:23,041
has come to alive, and
it's out there somewhere.

509
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:26,392
What if its two friends
do wake up and join it?

510
00:28:26,392 --> 00:28:27,872
(chuckling)

511
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,631
- That's some crazy fucked up shit.

512
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,341
- Why did you chain her?

513
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:35,813
- Are you gonna vouch
for her good behavior?

514
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,323
Found some chains in the other room,

515
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,003
you know, the work room.

516
00:28:39,003 --> 00:28:41,539
Wrapped them around her and the table.

517
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:44,792
Hey, it gives me a
feeling of security, okay?

518
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,061
- I'm not arguing.

519
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:48,573
- You know, I do understand our situation.

520
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,773
I don't like being, you know...

521
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:52,459
Fuckin', what the fuck's the word?

522
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,292
- Patronized?

523
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,301
- Patronized, yes, thank you.

524
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:55,218
Patronized.

525
00:28:56,723 --> 00:28:59,723
And nobody around here has
actually solved our situation.

526
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:01,603
Ya'll get the fuckin' drift though, right?

527
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:04,133
Some weird deadly shit
happens to some poor assholes

528
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,624
a hundred years ago

529
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:08,192
and now we're here to do
the same fuckin' thing.

530
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,359
Then we die...

531
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:13,309
Or whatever the fuck you call this.

532
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:14,142
- But why?

533
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:14,975
- Why?

534
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:15,939
It's fuckin' destiny.

535
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:19,469
- I mean if this ritual had
succeeded a hundred years ago

536
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:22,709
and started this age of
fire or whatever it is...

537
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,120
The point is it didn't.

538
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,307
It failed a hundred years ago.

539
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,731
The point is maybe we're here now

540
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:30,898
to do what they didn't do.

541
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,571
- So they found some way to stop it,

542
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:35,861
is that what you're saying?

543
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:37,100
- For the ritual to
work, what did they say?

544
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,361
They needed three victims
and three killers right?

545
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,300
- Yes.

546
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
- Okay.

547
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,565
(eerie screeching)

548
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:43,398
- Shit.

549
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:45,357
- It's on the roof.

550
00:29:45,357 --> 00:29:49,107
The door, the door, bar
the fucking door now.

551
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,477
(glass breaking)

552
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,321
- [Alma] He's not...

553
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:33,652
(drowned out talking)

554
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:43,828
- You're going down, motherfucker!

555
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,163
- I couldn't move.

556
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,403
I couldn't move an inch.

557
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:06,350
- [Len] No shit.

558
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,043
- But you could!

559
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:09,053
Why?

560
00:31:09,053 --> 00:31:10,510
- [Len] Don't look a
gift horse in the mouth.

561
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,550
- Why is it that that thing can freeze

562
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,479
the rest of us, not you!

563
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,340
- What the hell you
getting on my case for?

564
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,173
How should I know?

565
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,190
- What's different about
you, what makes you immune?

566
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,185
- Three masters, three
of us to do the dying,

567
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:24,394
and three of us to do the killing.

568
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:25,413
- What's that supposed to mean?

569
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:27,992
- I get it, I get what you're saying.

570
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:29,902
All the rest of us were here.

571
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:33,413
It wasn't until Tina died
that that thing came to life.

572
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:35,002
So it couldn't have killed her.

573
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:37,169
- Christ, it's no mystery.

574
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:39,904
She went out to the graveyard,

575
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:41,573
Paul followed her and killed her.

576
00:31:41,573 --> 00:31:42,624
- Fuck you, Robert!

577
00:31:42,624 --> 00:31:43,733
- It happened, man.

578
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:45,104
You did it.

579
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:47,944
That's got to be the
reason why you're immune.

580
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:51,242
You brought it alive by killing Tina.

581
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,382
- You're talking out of your asses, man.

582
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:54,922
You don't know what the
hell happened up there.

583
00:31:54,922 --> 00:31:55,755
- Yeah?

584
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:58,653
Where's the hatchet?

585
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:00,293
- I don't know!

586
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,882
I left it up at the graveyard, I...

587
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,049
- What are you doing, man?

588
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:12,642
- Come on, look at it.

589
00:32:12,642 --> 00:32:14,893
This is what killed her.

590
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,143
Go ahead, look.

591
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:24,064
In the middle of her fucking chest.

592
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:28,792
It's not from a claw, it's not
from some supernatural thing.

593
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:30,592
It's from the hatchet.

594
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:32,672
The one you killed her with.

595
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:34,402
- Don't you understand?

596
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,822
You could've killed her without being able

597
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,133
to stop yourself.

598
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:39,070
Maybe without even knowing.

599
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,922
- What happened out there, Paul?

600
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:42,864
- I told you guys.

601
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:45,154
I found her in the
graveyard, just like I said.

602
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:46,234
She was looking at one of those stones

603
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,085
with her name on it.

604
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:50,733
She turned around and she
looked at me and she...

605
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:53,885
She turned around and she
looked at me and she...

606
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,731
What the fuck are you looking at!

607
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:56,564
You know what?

608
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:57,397
Fuck this man.

609
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:59,525
I'm not a fucking murderer!

610
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,363
I can tell you something else.

611
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:03,917
If that thing can't keep me
from chopping her with an ax,

612
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:04,795
then maybe it can't keep me in this

613
00:33:04,795 --> 00:33:07,433
fucking place any longer.

614
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:08,824
So guess what?

615
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:11,014
I'll see you poor bastards later.

616
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:13,355
Even better, never.

617
00:33:13,355 --> 00:33:14,355
Adios, gone.

618
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,955
- You're gonna go out there
with that thing still there?

619
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,115
- Bingo.

620
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:20,176
I'm a little more worried about the shit

621
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,593
going on in here.

622
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:24,576
Goodbye to this whole fuckin' nightmare.

623
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:25,976
- Best of fuckin' luck.

624
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:27,342
- Oh, I'm telling you guys...

625
00:33:27,342 --> 00:33:30,009
(loud growling)

626
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,270
(ominous instrumental music)

627
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:05,574
- I've gotta go.

628
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:06,407
- What?

629
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:10,531
- Everybody stay away from me!

630
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:11,825
- What's wrong with you?

631
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:13,325
- It's calling me.

632
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:16,575
I've gotta go.

633
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:17,995
- It's okay.

634
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:19,594
We won't let you go.

635
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:22,522
- How are we supposed to stop her?

636
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:24,295
- Don't touch me!

637
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,295
Everyone just stay away.

638
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,716
I've gotta go.

639
00:34:28,716 --> 00:34:30,049
- No, come back!

640
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,756
- Nothing's holding me back.

641
00:34:32,756 --> 00:34:34,265
Don't you see, I can follow her.

642
00:34:34,265 --> 00:34:35,305
- And do what?

643
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:38,036
That totem thing's not gonna hurt her.

644
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:40,575
They need three of us as victims,

645
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:43,124
and three of us as killers.

646
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,025
So if we all stay here--

647
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:45,644
- What are you talking about?

648
00:34:45,644 --> 00:34:47,394
- She's safe, get it?

649
00:34:48,364 --> 00:34:51,164
One of us is the one meant to kill her.

650
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,195
- Yeah?

651
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:53,324
What about Paul?

652
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,874
He's still out there.

653
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:57,154
- If one could kill all of us,

654
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:59,595
it wouldn't need six of us.

655
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:01,428
- Just stay here, man.

656
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,882
- You know what?

657
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:07,626
It's all a bunch of bullshit guesses.

658
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:10,216
We don't know anything.

659
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:13,325
She shouldn't be out there in the dark.

660
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:15,205
So fuck you man.

661
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:16,705
- Don't be stupid.

662
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,049
- I'm not.

663
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:24,538
- Shit.

664
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:27,889
Now what?

665
00:36:07,702 --> 00:36:09,119
- It's all right.

666
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,867
It's all right, we're safe now.

667
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:25,387
Don't you see?

668
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:26,470
I planned it.

669
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:29,118
I knew that whoever followed me would be

670
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:31,907
the one that would try to kill me.

671
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,740
Like Paul killed Tina.

672
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:36,594
Don't you see?

673
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:39,418
I stopped the ritual.

674
00:36:39,418 --> 00:36:41,158
- How do you figure that?

675
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:42,465
- He's dead.

676
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:43,545
And if one of the killers is dead

677
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:46,169
then that means the
ritual can't be completed.

678
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:48,299
- And what killer is that?

679
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:49,379
- Len!

680
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,049
What's the matter with you?

681
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:52,187
If I hadn't done that then we don't--

682
00:36:52,187 --> 00:36:53,020
- Whoever told you that you were

683
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,860
supposed to be one of the victims?

684
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,693
- What?

685
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,351
- Don't you understand?

686
00:36:57,351 --> 00:37:01,518
Len is the second victim, and
you are the second killer.

687
00:37:02,623 --> 00:37:03,873
- You're crazy.

688
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,436
(eerie ambient music)

689
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:26,364
(growling)

690
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:41,309
- The second killer has killed.

691
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:47,410
The second victim is
offered to the lifeblood.

692
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:53,384
The second master whose name is terror

693
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:57,687
wakes up.

694
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:04,471
(screeching)

695
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,708
(screeching)

696
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,672
- So...

697
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:51,339
If a killer can't kill a second time...

698
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:53,309
- I can add...

699
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:56,208
It's either you're going to kill me,

700
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,678
or I'm going to kill you.

701
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:00,949
It's really basic.

702
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:02,678
- Why don't they just do it then?

703
00:39:02,678 --> 00:39:06,499
If they can control us, if
they can just make us do it...

704
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:07,907
- How the hell should I know?

705
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:10,229
Maybe they're on some
kind of time schedule,

706
00:39:10,229 --> 00:39:13,109
maybe things have to happen just so...

707
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:14,692
Who the hell knows?

708
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:16,481
- Maybe...

709
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:20,425
Maybe if we tried to kill ourselves...

710
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,025
- If they can stop us from
walking away from here,

711
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:24,518
what makes you think
that they can't stop us

712
00:39:24,518 --> 00:39:25,979
from doing that?

713
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:30,139
- I'm just trying to think of something.

714
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,556
Robert no, don't!

715
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:35,318
- [Robert] It's your idea, I'm game.

716
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:37,568
- No please, Robert please!

717
00:39:38,447 --> 00:39:39,867
- It's my life!

718
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:40,700
It's my fucking life!

719
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,275
- No don't!

720
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:43,108
Robert!

721
00:39:52,462 --> 00:39:53,545
- I couldn't.

722
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:55,918
I couldn't.

723
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:01,935
We're theirs, that's all.

724
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,987
Don't you see?

725
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:07,382
What they want us to do, we do.

726
00:40:07,382 --> 00:40:10,899
What they don't want us to do, we can't.

727
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:12,011
We're nothing.

728
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:12,844
- No.

729
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:15,148
No, we're not.

730
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,282
Robert, listen to me.

731
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:20,731
Please.

732
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:24,093
I want you to promise me
that you won't do this.

733
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:25,280
That you won't kill yourself.

734
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,431
- What difference does--

735
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:28,598
- Robert, just promise me.

736
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:30,315
- Why not?

737
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:35,501
No different than promising
not to go to the moon.

738
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,834
Sure, I promise.

739
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,362
- There's got to be another way.

740
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:41,612
- [Robert] Why?

741
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:46,470
- I'm not sure what it means when you said

742
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,616
the age of fire and blood returning.

743
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:57,633
Well it didn't return a hundred years ago.

744
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:01,445
Robert, listen to me.

745
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:03,933
It didn't return a
hundred years ago, right?

746
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:04,970
- Yeah.

747
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,354
- That means that those people,

748
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,687
they found a way to stop it.

749
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,920
- Maybe they prayed.

750
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:20,784
- There's something written here.

751
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:28,096
- What?

752
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:28,929
What is it?

753
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:30,596
- Something circled.

754
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:32,598
Isiah.

755
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:38,680
Therefore as the fire
devoureth the stubble,

756
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,653
and the flame consumeth the chaff,

757
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:44,594
so their root shall be as rottenness,

758
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:48,564
and their blossom shall go up as dust.

759
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:50,514
And in the margins...

760
00:41:50,514 --> 00:41:54,681
And we shall no more offer
our sacrifices onto devils.

761
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:58,415
Fire shall devour them.

762
00:41:58,415 --> 00:41:59,415
God help us.

763
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:02,917
- So they burned them.

764
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:09,466
They don't look particularly
flammable to me.

765
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:11,633
- If we could kill them...

766
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:13,926
- Well you're the only one who could

767
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:16,566
do anything in that department.

768
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:18,905
You want to take a crack at them?

769
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:21,565
- It doesn't make any sense.

770
00:42:21,565 --> 00:42:24,396
If they had burned them
a hundred years ago

771
00:42:24,396 --> 00:42:27,196
or found some other way to kill them...

772
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:29,276
Then why are they still here?

773
00:42:29,276 --> 00:42:30,396
- Who knows?

774
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:32,156
Maybe they grew back.

775
00:42:32,156 --> 00:42:35,239
Makes as much sense as anything else.

776
00:42:51,374 --> 00:42:53,574
- I need to talk to you.

777
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,407
- What?

778
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,677
- Don't work with him.

779
00:42:55,677 --> 00:42:57,597
I need to talk to you alone.

780
00:42:57,597 --> 00:43:00,387
- I don't think that's a good idea--

781
00:43:00,387 --> 00:43:02,447
- Hey, go ahead.

782
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:03,530
I don't mind.

783
00:43:05,307 --> 00:43:06,677
Oh Roz...

784
00:43:06,677 --> 00:43:08,067
Just don't figure that
you're gonna catch me

785
00:43:08,067 --> 00:43:10,515
unaware like you did Len.

786
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,765
That trick only works once.

787
00:43:31,227 --> 00:43:32,816
- Close the door.

788
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:36,483
There's a bolt on it,
pull it shut will you?

789
00:43:42,482 --> 00:43:43,964
I don't wanna be judged.

790
00:43:43,964 --> 00:43:46,047
- I'm not judging anyone.

791
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:48,228
- You know...

792
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,515
You live in civilization...

793
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,294
Yesterday I wouldn't have even
dreamed of killing anything.

794
00:43:56,294 --> 00:43:58,914
Not a cat or a squirrel.

795
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:00,884
Everything is so solid.

796
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,324
You think it is, but it isn't.

797
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:06,204
Everything we think is
so real and permanent,

798
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:10,346
law and civilization and morality
and reason, it's nothing.

799
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:11,179
- Roz...

800
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:13,337
- Something suddenly happens and then

801
00:44:13,337 --> 00:44:17,345
it's like the thinnest
shell you ever thought of.

802
00:44:17,345 --> 00:44:20,044
The shell the size of
an atom just laid out

803
00:44:20,044 --> 00:44:22,305
down on top of just...

804
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:23,722
A world gone mad.

805
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:29,774
There's no reason, no
civilization, nothing.

806
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:32,454
Just the fundamental stuff.

807
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:37,006
Like men stuck in a life
raft or starving in a cave.

808
00:44:37,006 --> 00:44:38,734
Just the fundamental stuff.

809
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:40,901
- Roz, I don't understand.

810
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:44,916
What is it you're trying to tell me?

811
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,685
- Come away from the door.

812
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:47,518
- Why?

813
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,351
- Well he might be out
there, we don't know,

814
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,934
he might be listening.

815
00:44:49,934 --> 00:44:51,196
Just because he didn't kill himself

816
00:44:51,196 --> 00:44:52,925
doesn't mean that we're safe.

817
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:57,414
They can make him do anything
they want at any time.

818
00:44:57,414 --> 00:44:58,844
I'm just gonna turn the
lights down a little bit,

819
00:44:58,844 --> 00:45:00,254
I want to show you something.

820
00:45:00,254 --> 00:45:01,813
- What?

821
00:45:01,813 --> 00:45:02,813
- Just wait.

822
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:08,014
- Okay, now what is it?

823
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:09,353
- Look over there, there's
a crack in the wall,

824
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:12,012
you can see it in the dark.

825
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,753
Be careful.

826
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,673
- [Almba] I can't see anything.

827
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:17,492
- There, it's a light.

828
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:19,743
See there, there's something there.

829
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,849
Don't you see, don't you see,

830
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:22,129
it doesn't matter which one of you goes

831
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:24,239
just as long as I kill someone.

832
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,239
Cause the ritual can't be completed.

833
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:34,556
Stop it, stop it, you're
just making it harder.

834
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,467
- Hey, are you all right?

835
00:45:42,467 --> 00:45:45,069
- We're fine, we just dropped something.

836
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:47,069
Shh, be quiet, be quiet!

837
00:45:48,968 --> 00:45:52,578
Stop it, if you ruin this we're all dead.

838
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:54,069
- Hey, Alma?

839
00:45:54,069 --> 00:45:56,440
- Go away, it's none of your business!

840
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,920
- [Robert] Get this fucking door open.

841
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,753
- No!

842
00:45:58,753 --> 00:45:59,586
Go away!

843
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,978
He's gonna be late, you're too late.

844
00:46:08,978 --> 00:46:12,478
Stop opening it, you're not gonna come in.

845
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:22,706
What is it?

846
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:26,972
What is that thing?

847
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:29,260
Oh my God!

848
00:46:33,065 --> 00:46:35,482
(screeching)

849
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:39,376
Get out of here!

850
00:46:46,142 --> 00:46:47,475
Get out of here!

851
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:51,546
What the fuck, get out of here!

852
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:58,174
(screaming)

853
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,438
(screaming)

854
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:29,688
No, no, no, no!

855
00:47:40,146 --> 00:47:42,173
(screaming)

856
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:43,362
Help!

857
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:45,695
(screaming)

858
00:48:04,994 --> 00:48:05,827
Help!

859
00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:11,716
Robert, help me!

860
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:12,883
Somebody help!

861
00:48:15,897 --> 00:48:16,730
No!

862
00:48:17,696 --> 00:48:18,613
Help, help!

863
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:28,969
- [Narrator] The mists of time felled.

864
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,839
The murky depths are torn asunder,

865
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,839
unleashing ancient evil.

866
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:52,455
Three masters spawned
from one heresy rise up.

867
00:49:01,312 --> 00:49:03,982
Controlling the dead, the creatures wage

868
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:07,982
a brutal war of genocide
against the human race.

869
00:49:15,991 --> 00:49:19,741
Lakes of blood swallow
living and dead alike.

870
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:29,150
As the earth's very soul flickers

871
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,261
on the brink of extinction,

872
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:33,679
the warrior tribe stands alone against

873
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,929
the destroyers of humanity.

874
00:49:43,088 --> 00:49:45,939
In the end, only the purification wrought

875
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:47,597
by the flames of heaven,

876
00:49:47,597 --> 00:49:51,097
I could halt the onslaught of the masters.

877
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:58,952
The armies of the dead fell.

878
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:01,513
Their tainted flesh and twisted bone

879
00:50:01,513 --> 00:50:05,096
blackened and burned
by the cleansing fire.

880
00:50:10,902 --> 00:50:13,734
But the masters themselves disappeared,

881
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:17,554
lost amidst the scattered
rubble of mankind.

882
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:19,637
Awaiting their new birth.

883
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:36,882
- Hey.

884
00:50:36,882 --> 00:50:37,715
You okay?

885
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:40,632
- Yeah.

886
00:50:40,632 --> 00:50:41,465
Roz?

887
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:44,938
- They took her away.

888
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:46,521
Don't you remember?

889
00:50:47,891 --> 00:50:50,058
- It's a little bit vague.

890
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:51,785
Ouch.

891
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:56,432
- Nobody here but us chickens.

892
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:57,653
Well...

893
00:50:57,653 --> 00:50:59,153
Us chickens and...

894
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:05,792
- [Alma] She isn't moving.

895
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:07,042
- Yeah, I know.

896
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,941
She's in, the type of state she's in.

897
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:13,858
Not dead but dead dead.

898
00:51:15,712 --> 00:51:18,772
I think their powers must wax and wane.

899
00:51:18,772 --> 00:51:20,709
I don't know why.

900
00:51:20,709 --> 00:51:24,269
Maybe after they attack
they need to recover.

901
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:26,947
Maybe it's got to do with the ritual.

902
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:29,447
She's kind of the thermometer.

903
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:32,552
We're in a low point now.

904
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:36,347
- Maybe if their powers
are low we can get away.

905
00:51:36,347 --> 00:51:37,557
- No.

906
00:51:37,557 --> 00:51:39,314
Already tried.

907
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:42,968
Got away maybe another 10 or 15 feet,

908
00:51:42,968 --> 00:51:45,498
and then it was the same thing.

909
00:51:45,498 --> 00:51:48,037
- Wait a minute, you left me here?

910
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:49,168
- No.

911
00:51:49,168 --> 00:51:50,466
Actually I carried you.

912
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:51,466
- Oh, sorry.

913
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:54,688
Thanks.

914
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:56,855
- You're not light either.

915
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,038
- How long was I out?

916
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:02,288
- Couple hours.

917
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,440
- I was having a dream...

918
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,469
- I think I'm still having one.

919
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:10,800
- That totem thing was in it.

920
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
And vikings.

921
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:15,568
Something about a viking funeral.

922
00:52:16,438 --> 00:52:17,938
It's all mixed up.

923
00:52:19,328 --> 00:52:20,915
- This can't go on much longer.

924
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:22,766
I mean the powers is weak now,

925
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:24,822
but it won't stay that way.

926
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:26,524
And when the time comes,

927
00:52:26,524 --> 00:52:28,595
they'll make us do whatever they want.

928
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:32,012
They will make me kill you or you kill...

929
00:52:33,646 --> 00:52:35,606
Here, give me your arm.

930
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:36,864
- What's the point?

931
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:37,736
- Just take it.

932
00:52:37,736 --> 00:52:39,156
- It doesn't make a difference.

933
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,156
Either way they can make--

934
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,406
- It may not make any difference to them,

935
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:44,739
it makes a difference to me.

936
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,486
If it comes down to it,

937
00:52:47,486 --> 00:52:50,456
if they try to make me
do something to you,

938
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:53,336
if you can, you use that.

939
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,876
Maybe neither of us have any choice,

940
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:58,336
but I don't want to a killer.

941
00:52:58,336 --> 00:53:00,910
Especially not yours.

942
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:05,238
So if it comes down to it,
even if you think it will,

943
00:53:05,238 --> 00:53:06,321
you use that.

944
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,379
- So why do you carry a knife

945
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:13,099
if you don't want to use it?

946
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:14,828
- I don't know.

947
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:18,245
Plus it made me think that I had options.

948
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:21,467
It only just now struck me that I couldn't

949
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:23,717
use this thing on a person,

950
00:53:24,628 --> 00:53:27,961
and even if I could, I wouldn't want to.

951
00:53:29,547 --> 00:53:32,868
I don't know if it makes me a pacifist or

952
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:34,467
just a coward.

953
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:36,097
- No.

954
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:38,506
You're not a coward.

955
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,256
You're not, you're...

956
00:53:44,303 --> 00:53:45,136
The bible.

957
00:53:49,004 --> 00:53:51,244
The viking funeral.

958
00:53:51,244 --> 00:53:52,724
- There's something about a viking funeral

959
00:53:52,724 --> 00:53:53,972
in the bible?

960
00:53:53,972 --> 00:53:54,889
- No, wait.

961
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:57,776
Here.

962
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:02,132
And we shall no more offer our sacrifices

963
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:03,732
onto the devils.

964
00:54:03,732 --> 00:54:06,244
The fire shall devour them.

965
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,863
Devour who?

966
00:54:07,863 --> 00:54:10,122
Who shall the fire devour?

967
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,071
- The devils.

968
00:54:11,071 --> 00:54:13,381
The fire shall devour the devils.

969
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:14,964
- No, no that's it.

970
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:20,304
The fire shall devour the sacrifices.

971
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:23,897
- Don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

972
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:25,466
- When that totem thing first came in here

973
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:27,727
what was it doing?

974
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:31,778
- Just moving around,
looking at us, look--

975
00:54:31,778 --> 00:54:36,157
- It wanted something,
and where did it go?

976
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:36,990
- It went...

977
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:37,823
- Right.

978
00:54:39,418 --> 00:54:41,986
It was trying to get the chains loose,

979
00:54:41,986 --> 00:54:44,487
and Paul came after it.

980
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:48,197
Its power strong then, but
it knew it could be hurt,

981
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:49,949
that's why it ran.

982
00:54:49,949 --> 00:54:51,458
It knew it could be hurt,

983
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,708
but it took that risk, why?

984
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:55,714
- You think...

985
00:54:56,578 --> 00:54:58,019
For her?

986
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:00,008
- I think that however
this ritual ends up,

987
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:01,838
they need all of us intact.

988
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,648
They could've killed Roz, but they didn't.

989
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:06,630
They carried her away.

990
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,088
And I bet they didn't kill Paul either.

991
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:10,760
They have Len's body,

992
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,800
and they tried to get Tina's.

993
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,368
And we shall no more offer
our sacrifices onto devils.

994
00:55:17,368 --> 00:55:20,046
The fire shall devour them.

995
00:55:20,046 --> 00:55:21,879
Devour the sacrifices.

996
00:55:22,959 --> 00:55:24,680
- Like in a viking funeral.

997
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,260
Without all the bodies intact,

998
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,175
the ritual cannot be completed.

999
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:30,996
- We have to get her outside.

1000
00:55:30,996 --> 00:55:32,972
- Look, I'll move her to the door,

1001
00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:35,866
you get the rest of the lamp oil.

1002
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:38,699
- There's some kindling over here.

1003
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:42,164
(loud yelling)

1004
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,657
(eerie ambient music)

1005
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,531
(growling)

1006
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:42,582
(laughing)

1007
00:57:42,582 --> 00:57:45,716
- [Paul] Stop fucking laughing.

1008
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:49,206
- Blessing for the three victims,

1009
00:57:49,206 --> 00:57:52,172
blessing for the three killers.

1010
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:55,916
Blessing for the three bloody masters.

1011
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:59,732
Blessed is the bloody
master who have woken up

1012
00:57:59,732 --> 00:58:02,196
and walks through the sky.

1013
00:58:02,196 --> 00:58:04,636
Blessed is the bloody master who is

1014
00:58:04,636 --> 00:58:07,316
the breaker of the earth.

1015
00:58:07,316 --> 00:58:09,126
Blessed is the bloody master

1016
00:58:09,126 --> 00:58:12,697
whose waking up shall
make the last sleeping

1017
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,114
of the old world.

1018
00:58:14,988 --> 00:58:18,226
Blessed are the three masters

1019
00:58:18,226 --> 00:58:21,606
who were made when the world was young

1020
00:58:21,606 --> 00:58:24,817
and who have come up out of the earth

1021
00:58:24,817 --> 00:58:27,234
in their season of waking up.

1022
00:58:28,148 --> 00:58:31,659
Bless the three masters of the dead

1023
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:35,025
in the season of the waking of the dead

1024
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:36,918
and the dead shall rise

1025
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:39,539
in the season of the
waking from the earth.

1026
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,456
- Oh God, oh no, oh no.

1027
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,451
Robert, Robert, listen to me.

1028
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:49,050
- [Paul] He's dead, it's inside there.

1029
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:51,281
- Robert is there something inside of you

1030
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:55,289
that can still hear me, that
can still understand, Robert?

1031
00:58:55,289 --> 00:58:57,339
Robert, see what you're doing.

1032
00:58:57,339 --> 00:58:58,839
You're killing us!

1033
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:02,041
Robert, you don't wanna be a killer!

1034
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,041
You told me you never
wanted to kill anybody,

1035
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,721
remember what you said Robert?

1036
00:59:05,721 --> 00:59:07,161
Remember what you said?

1037
00:59:07,161 --> 00:59:09,348
Robert please don't kill us!

1038
00:59:09,348 --> 00:59:11,561
There's gotta be something left of you.

1039
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,401
Robert, you've gotta still be human,

1040
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:14,910
that thing can control your body

1041
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,493
but it can't control your soul!

1042
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:28,076
Robert, help us Robert.

1043
00:59:30,037 --> 00:59:32,454
Robert, cut us loose, please.

1044
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,752
- Cut me loose Robert, cut me loose.

1045
00:59:38,752 --> 00:59:41,002
Cut me loose, cut me loose.

1046
00:59:55,267 --> 00:59:57,600
(screaming)

1047
01:00:01,346 --> 01:00:02,179
Oh shit!

1048
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:21,822
Shit!

1049
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,433
Ah shit!

1050
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:26,505
Tina, help me!

1051
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:31,507
Oh shit, oh shit.

1052
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:41,296
Tina, help me!

1053
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:44,689
I didn't mean to kill you.

1054
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:45,951
You know I didn't mean to...

1055
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,284
(screaming)

1056
01:01:57,665 --> 01:01:59,915
(laughing)

1057
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:05,450
(intense instrumental music)

1058
01:08:15,611 --> 01:08:18,444
(MultiCom Jingle)
