1
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,300
Tabos.

2
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,000
Lord Miraz.

3
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,100
You have a son.

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,900
The Heavens have blessed us.

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,600
You know your orders.

6
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,700
General Glozelle.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,900
Yes, my Lord.

8
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,900
Five more minutes.

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,400
You won't be watching the stars
tonight, my prince.

10
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Come, we must hurry!

11
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,200
- Professor, what's going on?
- Your aunt has giveth birth...

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
...to a son.

13
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Come.

14
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,000
- You must make through the woods.
- The woods?

15
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,600
They won't follow you there.

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It has taken me many years to find this.

17
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,100
Don't use it except that is necessary.

18
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,300
- Will I ever see you again?
- I dearly hope so, my prince.

19
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
There is so much more than that to tell you.

20
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,600
Everything you know, is about to change.

21
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Close the tower!

22
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,600
Now go!

23
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,400
Hold there!

24
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,700
<i > A son, a son!, tonight
Mrs., he/she has given a son to Lord Miraz.

25
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,600
Those that prefer to be superstitious
they will spend the night in the prison.

26
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
He/she saw us!

27
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,500
Take charge of him.

28
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,800
No!

29
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,000
- Have more care, baby!
- I sit down it.

30
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,500
- To where you go?.
- Wait for me.

31
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,900
- You Study in St. Fimbars?
- It is this way.

32
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,300
I study in the House
Hendon, crossing the street.

33
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,100
I have seen you.

34
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,700
You are always alone.

35
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,900
Yes, it is that... me,
I prefer them to leave me alone.

36
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Me also.

37
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
As you call yourself?

38
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,800
- Phillis.
- Susan!

39
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You have to come quick!

40
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,800
Take their newspaper, you finish them news!

41
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,600
Find out of you finish them news!

42
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,100
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

43
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,700
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

44
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!

45
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,900
Edmund!

46
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
High!

47
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,100
Enough boys!

48
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Already separate! Already coarse, already coarse!

49
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,900
- Of anything.
- He/she had it low control.

50
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,300
- And this time that was?
- I push myself.

51
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
- And did you hit it?
- No.

52
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,800
After pushing me, he/she wanted that me
it excused, it was when I hit it.

53
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,600
- You don't find difficult to go away.
- And why should I make it?

54
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,600
They don't get tired that those
do try as if they were children?

55
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,700
- We are children!
- I was not always it.

56
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,000
Already step an anus.

57
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,400
How much is it supposed that we should wait?

58
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,100
I believe that it is already time of accepting our
life here, is useless to fake something different.

59
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
No!

60
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
- Fake that they speak with me.
- We are speaking with you.

61
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,000
- Be quiet!
- It is that something chops myself!

62
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,400
- He/she hears, already coarse.
- But I didn't play you.

63
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,300
Do hear, why not you...?
What does it happen?

64
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
- It is as magic.
- The hands, hold you.

65
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,800
- Not I will make that!
- Make it!

66
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,100
Not you will be able to reach me, Ed!

67
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,200
Take care that there go!

68
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,000
There I go!

69
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
We made it!

70
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,400
Ed?... Ed!

71
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
- What does it happen?
- Where it is supposed that we are?

72
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,600
- And your where you believe?
- Not I remember ruins in Narnia.

73
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,300
Who did live here?

74
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,800
I believe that us.

75
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,000
Hear, that is mine!
Of my chess game.

76
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,300
What chess game?

77
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,200
Not I have a chess game
of gold been accustomed to in Finchley or yes?

78
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,500
Not it can be.

79
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,500
It imagines walls.

80
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
And columns somewhere around.

81
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,100
And a glass roof.

82
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,400
Cair Paravel!

83
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,400
Await! My gentleman await!

84
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,900
- Not it is what believes.
- Then what it is?

85
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
Nobody is sure.

86
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Impossible!

87
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,200
I noticed to the Council that if it deposited
their trust in Mr. Miraz...

88
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,200
- there would be consequences.
- No, not!

89
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,900
Nobody will accuse the one
Protective without a test.

90
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,000
How much more us
will we hide after that excuse?

91
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,300
Until each seat of
is this camera empty?

92
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Gentlemen of the Council, my
excuses to arrive late.

93
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,900
Nobody told me that there would be session.

94
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,500
Not there is doubt that something
it maintains it busy.

95
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,000
My Mr., since Caspian died IX,

96
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,900
we have seen that he/she behaves
as if it was the king.

97
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,500
And now, it seems that for those walls, the one
Prince Caspian disappeared.

98
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,500
I offer him/her my
condolences, Mister Miraz.

99
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,500
Imagine, to lose their nephew,
the legitimate heir to the throne,

100
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,300
the same night in that their wife
he/she gives him/her a son in blessing.

101
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,100
Thank You, Mister Sopespian. Their compassion
he/she is appreciated in these difficult moments.

102
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,800
I trust in that will tell us the reason
that it happened this tragedy.

103
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,600
He/she is the more agitator news.

104
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Our very dear one
Caspian... It was kidnapped.

105
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,100
By Narnianos.

106
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,600
He/she is going very far,
Miraz... He/she waits that us

107
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,200
let us remain silent while us
it accuses of the fragrante crime.

108
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
We forget, my gentlemen that Narnia
it was a wild earth once.

109
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Ferocious creatures
they marauded freely.

110
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,300
Our ancestros sacrificed their
lives to exterminate these monsters.

111
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,400
Or that believed.

112
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,200
While we lost the time
fighting among us.

113
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,400
They, reproduced as
cockroaches under the rock!

114
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,800
Growing strong, watching over us.

115
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Waiting to attack!

116
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,000
And does he/she wonder why I hate it so much?

117
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,600
So now I try to counterattack.

118
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,200
Although it should destroy the whole forest.

119
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,500
I assure them that I will find
to the prince Caspian and

120
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,700
I will finish that that our
ancestros began.

121
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,900
- Catapults.
- What?

122
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,200
That happened... Cair Paravel was attacked.

123
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,800
Do I suppose that you don't bring matches or yes?

124
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,000
No, but...

125
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Will this serve?

126
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,900
And why not him
did you mention a little bit before?

127
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,400
Not I can believe it, everything continues here.

128
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Were we so high?

129
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,500
Good, then mature eras.

130
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,900
Contrary to hundred of
years later. When you are girl.

131
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,700
- What does it happen?
- My horn, I should leave it in the mount.

132
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,500
The day that we return.

133
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,100
Brutal winter he/she has fallen.
With their potent roar.

134
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,500
To shake their mane.

135
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The spring it arrives.

136
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,400
All our friends...

137
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,900
Sr. Tumnus and the beavers.

138
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
They died.

139
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,200
I believe that it is moment of
to discover what it happens.

140
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,500
- Not he/she stops me to look.
- Because you don't look at it.

141
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
It is necessary to leave it here.

142
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,300
Liberate it!

143
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
Do liberate it?

144
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,500
- Was the best thing that you could say?
- A simple thank you will be well.

145
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,800
They without your help were
drowning perfectly.

146
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,400
We would maybe should
to have allowed them to make it.

147
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,500
But why were they about drowning?

148
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,700
They are Telmarinos, that is it they make.

149
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,600
Telmarinos? In Narnia?

150
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,100
Where you have been in
the last a hundred years?

151
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
It is a long history.

152
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,600
They should be joking.

153
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,600
Are you?

154
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,700
Are the kings and queens of in the past?

155
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,100
I Am the Great King Peter, the Magnificent One.

156
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,900
You should maybe omit that I finish.

157
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,200
Probably.

158
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,600
Perhaps it surprises you.

159
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,100
No, I don't believe that you want
to make that, boy.

160
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,200
Me not... Him

161
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,800
- Edmund!
- Are you well?

162
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Rays and flashes!

163
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Maybe after everything,
the horn works.

164
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,600
What horn?

165
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,100
<i > This bread is rancid.

166
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,400
<i > I Believe that better I will eat soup.

167
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,200
<i > - Not he/she will take in waking up.
- Yes, and now we have enough it forces.

168
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Nikabrik is alone a boy.

169
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,900
It is a telmarín, not
a lost puppy.

170
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,100
- You said that you would come undone of him.
- No, I said that I would take charge of him.

171
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:37,600
Not I can kill him now, to remove him/her the
head, would be as killing a guest.

172
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,500
And like you believe that they try
their friends to their companies?

173
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,900
Trumpkin knew that ago,
it is not the boy's blame.

174
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,000
High! High!

175
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Wait, no, no, not!

176
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,600
I told you that we came undone
of him when we had opportunity.

177
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
- You already know why we were not able to.
- If my vote is worth, I am with him.

178
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,200
Not we can allow it to go!
He/she has seen us!

179
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,600
Enough Nikabrik!... Or me
I sit down in your head again.

180
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,300
And your, looks at what you made me make.

181
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,800
The whole morning I passed in this soup.

182
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,200
What are you?

183
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,300
Do you know?, it is amusing
that you ask that question,

184
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,100
I suppose that you don't recognize
to a badger when you see it.

185
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,100
No, the truth is that... they are narnianos,
it is supposed that they are extinct.

186
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,600
I sit down to disappoint you.

187
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,400
Here you have. It is even hot.

188
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,900
From when we house
welded telmarinos in this place?

189
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,900
Not I am a soldier.

190
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,200
I Am the Prince Caspian... Tenth.

191
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
What are you making here?

192
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,400
Escaping.

193
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,000
My uncle... the only thing
that he/she wants it is my throne.

194
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,900
I suppose that... I allow myself to live until
now because he/she didn't have an own heir.

195
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,600
Good...
That changes the things.

196
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,600
Yes, it seems that to murder you
it won't be our task.

197
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,800
You are right.

198
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
To where you want to go?

199
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,900
My uncle won't surrender until I die.

200
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,000
But, you cannot leave,
you have come to survive.

201
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,800
Do you have some idea of what this is?

202
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,500
He/she has a library
impressive, doctor.

203
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,500
There is some thing that
do want to see, my Mr.?

204
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,300
I believe that I already found
what was looking for.

205
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,100
Found in one of my soldiers!

206
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,700
What do you know about the queen's horn Susan?

207
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,500
He/she says the legend that was magic.

208
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,300
Magic.

209
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,900
The narnianos believed that this he/she would call
to the kings and the queens of in the past.

210
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,600
Or at least, that said the superstition.

211
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,600
And how much Caspian knows
on this... superstition?

212
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,500
My Mr., you prohibited me that
he/she mentioned the old legends.

213
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
That made.

214
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,000
I will tell him/her this:

215
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,800
If Caspian heard on the great magic, my Mr.
he/she has good reasons to be nervous.

216
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,100
First our
Prince, now their tutor.

217
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,900
If the members of the summer house
they are not safe, are he us?

218
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,100
Mr. Sopespian!

219
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,200
They are dangerous words,
Mr. Sespiespan.

220
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,200
They are dangerous, General times.

221
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,600
It is necessary to take care of our words, with the one
same care that one chooses the friends.

222
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,300
How much to finish the bridge?

223
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,700
The continuous construction
according to that programmed.

224
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,900
That is not enough, I need
that my troops cross that river, already.

225
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,100
I can suggest that
do contribute with more men?

226
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,500
I don't have many to my disposition.

227
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,900
Fact that you will make well in not forgetting.

228
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,200
You go with Beruna, it takes
all the troops that you need,

229
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,900
we will reach Caspian before them.

230
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,800
- Them my Mr.?
- It is time that you learn, your history.

231
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
How still they are.

232
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,800
They are trees.
What did you wait?

233
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,300
They seem tired.

234
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,600
Soon after that they left,
the telmarinos invaded us.

235
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,100
The survivors hid
in the forest and the trees, them,

236
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,700
they sank in an I sound deep
of the one that you/they have not wakened up again.

237
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,600
I don't understand it.

238
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,900
- As Aslan that this happened allowed?
- Aslan?

239
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,200
I abandon us to the same one
time that you.

240
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,000
Not we did want to abandon them, do you know?

241
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,000
But doesn't that change the things or yes?

242
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,200
Take us with the narnianos.

243
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
And we will make it.

244
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,200
Hello!

245
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,000
Everything is well, we are friends.

246
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,600
Don't move, Majesty!

247
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,800
Take away from her!

248
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Susan shoots, shoot!

249
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,100
- Why didn't he/she stop?
- I suspect that it was hungry.

250
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,700
Thank you.

251
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,100
It was wild.

252
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,600
I believe that he/she went mad.

253
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,100
When they treat you as if you were
an animal, you transform into that.

254
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,100
Narnia is much wilder,
anything is as what you/they remember.

255
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,200
I can hear them.

256
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,400
I believe that it is necessary to wait
to the kings and the queens.

257
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Well, continuous, I doubt that those
others are so understanding.

258
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,800
Perhaps go with you, I want to see you
explaining all the minotauros.

259
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,500
Minotauros?

260
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,500
- They are real.
- And they have very bad character.

261
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,200
- And they are also immense.
- Gigantic.

262
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,500
What are there of the centaurs? Do they even exist?

263
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,300
Good, the centaurs
perhaps fight to your side.

264
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,500
But I won't assure you what
it is it they will make the other ones.

265
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,500
And what is there of Aslan?

266
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,800
- As it is that you know so much of us?
- Histories.

267
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,300
A moment... Your father you
am I histories Narnia it has more than enough?

268
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,800
No, my professor.

269
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,000
Listen, I regret it, but these
sew they should not wonder them.

270
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,200
- What does it happen?
- Human.

271
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,100
- Him?
- No, them.

272
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,700
There they are!

273
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,300
- There they are!
- Run!

274
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,300
- No!
- No, he/she waits, I will go.

275
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,000
Let us go!

276
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,900
He/she takes, veto, it is more important than me.

277
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,300
Take it to you of here.

278
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,400
He/she chooses well your you finish
words, telmarino.

279
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
You are a mouse.

280
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,300
He/she waited something a little more
original. He/she lifts your sword.

281
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,500
- No, thank you.
- Lift it!

282
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,400
Not I will fight with an unarmed man.

283
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,000
And for that reason that I will live more when not choosing
to collide swords with you, noble mouse.

284
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,800
I said that it would not fight,
I never said that you would live!

285
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,700
Reepicheep!
Detén your sword!

286
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
Trufflehunter?

287
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,100
I hope you have a good reason
for your inopportune interruption.

288
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,700
- He/she doesn't have it, continuous.
- He is who blow the horn.

289
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,700
- What?
- Let him to show it then.

290
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,700
That is the reason for the
that we have to meet.

291
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,900
Non memory this road.

292
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,600
It is the bad of the girls, not
they retain maps in the head.

293
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
That is because we already have
something in the head.

294
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,400
He/she would want him to listen to
their "lover" from time to time.

295
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,800
Lover?

296
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Their friend.

297
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,900
That yes that is not very considered, or yes?

298
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
I didn't get lost.

299
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,900
No.

300
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,100
Alone you took the mistaken road.

301
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,800
You Lost Casper in
the forest and the road

302
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,100
quicker it is crossing
the river for the torrent.

303
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,700
But if I don't make a mistake, not
you will find a crossing in these boulders.

304
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,900
Then that explains to it.

305
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,000
You made a mistake.

306
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,300
Do they come it?... With the time erosiona
the earth making deeper--

307
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,100
He/she shuts up.

308
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,500
- Is there way of lowering?
- Yes, falling.

309
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
When did we get lost?

310
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,100
There is a cascade near
Beruna. If they don't care to swim.

311
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,000
It is better than walking.

312
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,000
Aslan?
It is Aslan, it is over there Aslan!

313
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,500
Don't they come it?, there fair for...

314
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,900
there.

315
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,600
Do you see it now?

316
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,300
Not I am crazy, it was there,
he/she wanted us to follow it.

317
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,600
I assure you that this forest is
full with lions and bears also.

318
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,300
I believe that I know how to recognize
to Aslan when I see it.

319
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,700
Look, I won't jump to the cliff
for somebody that not even exists.

320
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,900
It finishes it time that I didn't believe him/her to
Lucy, I was as... as a fool.

321
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,700
Why didn't I see it?

322
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,300
Perhaps you didn't want to make it.

323
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,500
I sit down it Lu.

324
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,200
All that that horn proves, is that
you have stolen us more a thing.

325
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,700
I didn't steal them anything.

326
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,200
Didn't you steal us anything? I will show you everything
what the telmaritas removed us.

327
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,600
- Our home!
- Our freedom!

328
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,300
Our lives!

329
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,100
They want to become responsible
of the crimes of my town?

330
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Responsible and also punishable.

331
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,200
It is a nerve coming from you, midget.

332
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,400
Or you already forgot that it was your town the one
that I fight beside the Witch Blanca?

333
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,400
And with pleasure he/she would make it again, if that us
he/she helps to come undone of these barbarians.

334
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,100
It is a luck that is not
in your power to call it of turn.

335
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,400
For the time being.

336
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
No!

337
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,100
Many of you have already forgotten it,
but the badgers remember it very well,

338
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,700
that Narnia was never in order.
Except when Adam's son was king.

339
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,100
It is a telmarin. Why
would we want it as king?

340
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,500
Because I will help them.

341
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,700
Beyond this
forest, I am a prince.

342
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,900
The throne of the telmarinos is mine
for right. Help me to claim it.

343
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,100
And I will be able to bring the peace among us.

344
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,500
It is true, the time it is the correct one.

345
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,400
I watch over the skies,
because that it is my mission,

346
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,600
as well as that of the badger
it is the one of not forgetting.

347
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,200
Tarva the gentleman of the victory
and Alambil the lady of the Peace,

348
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,900
once again they meet in the sky.

349
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,000
They are here, Adam's son
to give us their comfort.

350
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,500
To return us our freedom.

351
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,700
Is it possible? Seriously you believe that we have
peace really? Do you really believe it?

352
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,500
Two days ago, he/she didn't believe
possible that existed

353
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,300
speaking creatures,
or midgets or centaurs.

354
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,700
And here they are, in adult I number of the one that
the telmarinos would have imagined.

355
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,000
Not I know if this horn is magic or not.

356
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
However it gathered us.

357
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,900
And together you that we go to
to recover what is our.

358
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,700
If your you guide us...

359
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,100
Then my children and me you
we offer our swords.

360
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,600
We offer you
our life, lowly.

361
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,500
The troops of Miraz no longer
they should be very far, Mr..

362
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,600
If we want to face them, it is
necessary to find soldiers and weapons.

363
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,500
I am for sure they will be here soon.

364
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,100
I am maybe bad idea to come here.

365
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,700
And where you believed
to see Aslan, exactly?

366
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:24,300
He/she would want them to no longer fake to be
adults, I didn't believe to have seen it, I saw it.

367
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,400
I am somebody bigger.

368
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,900
I saw it exactly for...

369
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,500
Lucy!

370
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,400
Here.

371
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,700
Lucy, are you awake?

372
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,800
Why do you believe that I didn't see Aslan?

373
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,800
- You believe me!
- Good, we are able to cross the river.

374
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,100
I don't know it.

375
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,200
Perhaps in fact you didn't want.

376
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,500
You always knew that
would we return to Narnia, truth?

377
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,200
That waited.

378
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,100
He/she had already made me to the idea of
that we would stay in England.

379
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,100
But are you glad to be here not?

380
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,100
While it lasts.

381
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,400
Lucy.

382
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,300
Lucy.

383
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,300
Aslan?!

384
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,400
I missed you a lot.

385
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,700
- You grew.
- Each anus that your you grow, I will grow.

386
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,600
Where you were?

387
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,700
Why didn't you help us?

388
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,900
Raisin swims twice
in the same way, lover.

389
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,100
Susan, awake.

390
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,700
Clear not.

391
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,200
As your you want.

392
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,000
Awake.

393
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,600
Aslan?

394
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,600
No, high!

395
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,500
- Prince Caspian?
- Yes, and who are your?

396
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,300
Peter!

397
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,900
- The Great King Peter.
- I believe that your you called us.

398
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,400
Yes, but I believed that you were bigger.

399
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,900
Good, if you prefer it,
we will return in some years.

400
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,700
No, it is well.

401
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,000
It is that, it is not exactly
what waited.

402
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,500
Neither your.

403
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,200
A common enemy, unites to those
older opponents.

404
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,600
We waited with longings
their return my Mr..

405
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,100
Our hearts and
souls are to their service.

406
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,300
Did you already dress him Susan?, it is so tender.

407
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,900
- Who did that say?!
- Pardon.

408
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,600
Majesty... With the due one
I respect, to my fearless view,

409
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,600
courteous or rash, they describe
better to a gentleman of Narnia.

410
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,500
Good, somebody here knows how to use the sword.

411
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,600
It is this way, and recently I used it for
to obtain weapons for their troops, Mr..

412
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,500
Well... Because we will need
all the swords that we have.

413
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,800
Because then, perhaps
should return you your sword.

414
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,500
How much was what you/they were taken?

415
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,900
Enough weapons and armors
for two regiments.

416
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,800
But... there is something more.

417
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,500
"You were right when fearing to the forest"

418
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,600
Caspian... Tenth.

419
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,900
Forgive me my Mr.... The blame is mine.

420
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,600
I know it.

421
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,200
Tell me General...

422
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,000
- How many men did you lose?
- None my Mr..

423
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,100
None?

424
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,900
They appeared as ghosts,
to half of the night.

425
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,800
We never saw them.

426
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,700
Then, like you explain your wounds?

427
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,100
I ask again...

428
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:04,700
How many men they were murdered
during the bloody one it does attack narniano?

429
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,700
To the one which your, for fortune survived.

430
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,200
General... help me.

431
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,500
Three.

432
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,300
I apologize, Mr. Sopespian.

433
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,000
Caspian, is not the victim
of the wild rising.

434
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,000
He is the instigator.

435
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,500
To my view, Narnia
a new king needs.

436
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,900
Very well, we will arrive soon...

437
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,400
And well? As they are?

438
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,400
Impertinent, turbulent,
obstinate as mules in the morning.

439
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,500
Then they fall you well.

440
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,600
Enough.

441
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,700
Be not maybe to what you/they were
accustomed, but it is safe.

442
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,500
Peter... they come to see this.

443
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,200
We are us.

444
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,400
What is this place?

445
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,800
Don't you know it?

446
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,200
They should know that they make.

447
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,200
I believe that it depends on us.

448
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,200
- Alone it is question of time.
- What does he/she intend to make, their Majesty?

449
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,000
- We should of--
- I believe that--

450
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,700
Our only hope is to attack them to
them before they attack us.

451
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,900
What madness, they never have
taken that castle.

452
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,400
- There is always a first time.
- We have the element surprise.

453
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,400
But the advantage has it here.

454
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,000
Under earth, I believe that
we would be able to stop them.

455
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,200
In the personal thing, I sit down
low surer earth.

456
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:24,500
He/she looks, appreciation all that you have made. But
this is not a strength, it is a tomb.

457
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,600
Yes, and if they siege us,
they will kill us of hunger.

458
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,200
- I would bring nuts.
- Yes, and we throw them to the telmarinos.

459
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:37,200
Be quiet! I believe that he/she already knows
what I think, Mr..

460
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,700
If I arrive to the troops, you
would you take charge of the guards?

461
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,800
Or attempting it, I will die.

462
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,700
It is what I worry about.

463
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,300
As you say?

464
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:05,600
Alone they are considering two
options: to die here or to die there.

465
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,900
- Not it seems that you are listening to it.
- No, your you are not listening.

466
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,500
It seems that you already forgot who the one was
that it conquered the Witch Blanca, Peter.

467
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,500
I believe that we already wait
to Aslan enough.

468
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,500
Professor?

469
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,100
I have to find it.

470
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,500
No, you don't have time,
you have to open the grill.

471
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,900
Without him you would never have arrived
here Peter, not even me.

472
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:59,900
- Your and I take charge of Miraz.
- I will be able to arrive on time to the grill.

473
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,900
Yes, I am a mouse!

474
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,200
We waited somebody more... higher.

475
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,200
- Look who says it.
- Is it supposed that that is irony?

476
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,900
Five minutes more?

477
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,300
What are you making here?

478
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,500
I didn't help you to escape for
that they catch you again.

479
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,000
You have to leave, before
Miraz finds out that you are here!

480
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,100
I swear that soon he/she will know it.

481
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:26,900
We will give him/her your cell.

482
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,500
Not I want you to underestimate to
Miraz like your father made it.

483
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:39,000
- Of what are you speaking?
- Pardon.

484
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:01,000
I am glad... that you are safe!

485
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,000
Get up!

486
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,300
What?

487
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,800
- Caspian?
- Stay there.

488
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,800
What are you making?

489
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,100
I would say that it is obvious, lover.

490
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,700
Some families would consider
your inappropriate behavior.

491
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,800
- That never stopped you.
- But your you are not similar to me, truth?

492
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,500
It is sad, for first
time you show gills.

493
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
And it is an I waste.

494
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,500
It lowers that sword, Caspian.

495
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,600
- Not I want to make this.
- We neither want!

496
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,400
- They respect this way the privacy.
- What are you making?

497
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,500
- You should be in the grill.
- No!

498
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,100
Although it is for one
time, I want the truth.

499
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,900
Did you murder my father?

500
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,700
Now you can assure it.

501
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,700
You said that your brother
he/she died while he/she slept.

502
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,000
It was certain more or less.

503
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,900
Caspian, this won't fix the things.

504
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
This alone race has
that that taking of others.

505
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,900
And all that knew it your father.

506
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,300
As you could?

507
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,100
For the same reason that
your you will press the trigger.

508
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,100
For our son.

509
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:29,700
- Hold!
- Stay I joust there!

510
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,000
You should make a decision, lover.

511
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,600
You want our son to be a king
or do you want him to be as Caspian?

512
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,000
- Shoot them
- No!

513
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,300
Caspian!

514
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,900
What is it supposed that it means?

515
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,200
They attack us!
Let us go!

516
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,200
To their positions!
Move!

517
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,800
- Peter!
- Our troops are out! Let us go!

518
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:43,900
- Now Ed makes it, call to the troops!
- Something am busy, Pet.

519
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,100
Peter, is very late, we have
that to leave before it is late!

520
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,600
No, I can even achieve it!

521
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:16,000
Help me!

522
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,500
Exactly for who
are you making this, Peter?

523
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:44,200
Let us go!

524
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,200
By Narnia!

525
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,800
By Narnia!

526
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,300
Archers!

527
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,500
Take positions in the tower!

528
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,000
Close the grill inmediatemente.

529
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,000
Retire!

530
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,200
We have to leave, now!

531
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,700
Run! Let us leave of here!

532
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,600
To the grill!

533
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,000
Run!

534
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,000
- Caspian!
- I will find it!

535
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,600
Leave of here, now!

536
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:02,800
Let us go! Retreat!

537
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,900
He/she gives the order.

538
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,100
- My men are there.
- Vámonos!

539
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,900
- Leave, retreat!
- Make headway!

540
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:00,400
Now!

541
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,400
Peter, the bridge!

542
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,800
- What step?
- Wonder it to him.

543
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,200
- Peter!
- Me?

544
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,800
Your you didn't want to cancel
and there was even time.

545
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,200
No, everything was thank you
to you, if there are you

546
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,700
attached to the plan, those
welded they would be even alive.

547
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,600
And if you had stayed as me
I suggested, for sure he would be.

548
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,800
Your you called us you remember?

549
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,800
It was my first error.

550
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,200
No, your first error was to believe
that you were a leader for them.

551
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,500
- Not I was me who abandon Narnia.
- You invaded Narnia.

552
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,400
You are an usurper, the same as Miraz!

553
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,400
Your and your father. Narnia
it is better without all you.

554
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,600
Stop!

555
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,900
Why do they look at me all?

556
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,600
The telmarinos will arrive soon.

557
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:49,300
Thank you, my dear friend.

558
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:12,100
Beruna offers him/her its troops.

559
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,100
Galma, offers him/her its troops.

560
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,400
Calavar offers him/her your troops.

561
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,500
Ettinsmoor offers him/her your troops.

562
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,200
Release life to the king!

563
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,900
Release life to the king!

564
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:15,100
Release life to the king!

565
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,800
You are even happy of having used
that magic horn, boy?

566
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,300
Your kings and queens failed us.

567
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,200
Half of your army it is dead
and the other ones soon he will be.

568
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,900
What do you want, to be happy?

569
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,200
Do you want your uncle's blood?
Me also.

570
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,500
Do you want their throne?
I will get it for you.

571
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,800
You can prove the power, the fire.

572
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,700
But there is even a bigger power,

573
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,400
one that has not undergone
to Aslan during more than 100 years.

574
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,800
Who is there?

575
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,700
I am hungry.

576
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,100
I am thirsty.

577
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,400
I could have a good time 100 years.

578
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,200
Without dying.

579
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,700
He/she could walk other a hundred for the ice.

580
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:04,100
And to breathe and to drink of a river.

581
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,200
And to explode...

582
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,400
Give it to me... You owe it to me!

583
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,400
He/she takes care of your language, lover.

584
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,400
Nobody is better than us.

585
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,500
And you can guarantee me
that Miraz will die?

586
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,400
And more.
