1
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:55,048
Oh, there you are.

2
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:20,978
Mel...

3
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,979
Melinda, open up, it's me!

4
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,286
Hey, asshole,
use the doorknocker!

5
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:43,002
I love you.

6
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,704
Melinda! Are you alright?

7
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:55,304
Oh God, Danny, it's him.
He followed us here.

8
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,641
- I love you so much, baby.
- There's someone else in there!

9
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:01,048
Open this door!

10
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,223
Melinda!

11
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,925
Call the police.

12
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,830
Asshole, try the doorknob!

13
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,303
Let me in!

14
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:26,508
Take your hands off her!

15
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:28,682
You! What?

16
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:32,845
Jesus, you're screwing
your husband!

17
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,146
- Your husband.
- He followed me here and we...

18
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,416
realized we deserve each other.
Isn't that romantic, Dr. Klink?

19
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,186
Roger, call me Roger,
for Christ's sake.

20
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,926
Maybe you should go home
and working it out with your wife.

21
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,099
Go to hell, Roger.

22
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:50,368
Ex-wife,
ex-home. Okay?

23
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:54,166
I understand now that I was
transgressing my love for Dan...

24
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,774
unto you, and you...

25
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:59,139
...were counter-transgressing!
- Transferring! Bullshit!

26
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,974
Any time a shrink is thinking
about a patient...

27
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:04,344
he should ask himself:
''Am I counter-transferring? ''.

28
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,918
Shut up. You can't even
get an erection.

29
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,851
I just had one, buddy.

30
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:14,693
Help!

31
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:16,020
Help!

32
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,698
He's bitting.

33
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,234
Dr. Paige, thank
God you are here.

34
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:26,034
Three peas in a pot.

35
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,107
Emily, they were fornicating
like honeymooners.

36
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,505
Dr. Paige, Melinda and I have
worked through our problems.

37
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:34,374
- Shut up, you!
- Dr. Paige!

38
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:38,675
It's alright, it's okay,
it has a bad trigger. It's okay.

39
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:40,410
Put the gun down, Dr. Paige.

40
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,112
- Shoot them, Emily.
- This is all your fault, Roger.

41
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:45,815
Everything could've been
so different.

42
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,597
Sorry, it's touchy.

43
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:52,527
Melinda, come back in here!

44
00:05:57,071 --> 00:06:00,268
Emily, I understand
you're upset...

45
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:03,739
you just have to let it out.
Just try and let it out.

46
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:09,075
Save your engaging devices,
Roger. No more bullshit.

47
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,649
No, I've come for all...

48
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,911
Sorry, sorry.

49
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:18,784
Over here! Over here!
Over here!

50
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,522
- Hurry, Dr. Paige has a gun.
- Who is Dr. Paige?

51
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,634
Our marriage counselor. She's gonna
kill my husband and Dr. Klink.

52
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:30,326
Your marriage counselor is gonna
kill your husband?

53
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:31,664
And Dr. Klink.

54
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,836
Dr. Paige, I want to thank you
for giving Melinda and I...

55
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,839
the tools to help communicate
and share our fears.

56
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:39,569
- Shut up!
- Emily, you're very upset...

57
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,217
your feelings are
spiraling out of control.

58
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,716
Save your psycho-babble
for your patients, Roger.

59
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:50,852
Okay, you've some issues
you need to work through.

60
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:53,322
- No. Thank God.
- Get out of the way.

61
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:54,687
Mel, it's me, open up!

62
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:02,965
- Somebody help me!
- Don't worry, Danny!

63
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,707
- What do we got, sir?
- Hostage situation. Two therapists.

64
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:09,899
Domestic or international?

65
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,343
- Therapists, shrinks.
- Shrinks? It's a joke, right?

66
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:19,315
- Some kind of surprise party?
- It's not a party, is very serious.

67
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,387
A counselor is threatening to
kill her husband and therapist.

68
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,253
He's not technically
my therapist.

69
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:29,824
- You're the lady from those sex tapes.
- Sex tapes? What sex tapes?

70
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:34,395
His hands were under my dress...
firmly holding onto my hips.

71
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:37,298
Moving me back and
forth away from him.

72
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:40,239
Okay, maybe I better
start from the beginning.

73
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,466
About 2 years ago
Danny lost his erection.

74
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:43,836
You gotta see these tapes.

75
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:47,309
Pretty soon, Danny and me weren't
even talking and then, Danny...

76
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:50,210
...slept with that waitress.
- Thought he couldn't get an erection?

77
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,978
So did I.
Our marriage was doomed.

78
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:57,214
Then, I saw Dr. Paige's add
on a bus bench.

79
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:01,724
''Save your marriage today,
tomorrow will be too late''.

80
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,420
Her big deal is honesty.

81
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:13,164
Honesty first.
The key is honesty.

82
00:08:17,177 --> 00:08:20,578
Marriage is hard, I know,
I've been married three times.

83
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,305
- You're divorced?
- Three times.

84
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:26,350
- I speak from experience...
- Is that a marriage counselor?

85
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:28,180
- Dan!
- Dan, what?

86
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,517
We're taking advice from
somebody that's been divorced...

87
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:34,125
and advertises on bus benches.

88
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,223
Stay with us, Dan.

89
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,326
You know the story about the
guy who goes to the barbershop?

90
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:46,702
There are two barbers,
both available.

91
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:49,501
One barber has a terrific haircut...

92
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,804
the other barber's
hair looks just awful.

93
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:55,038
Which barber would you go to?

94
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,648
You go to the barber
with the bad haircut.

95
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:01,343
Not the barber with
the good haircut, see?

96
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:05,782
The bad haircut cuts the other
one's hair and vice versa.

97
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:11,295
That is why it is actually a
plus that I'm thrice divorced.

98
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:16,166
Okay.

99
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,971
Let's start over.

100
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:25,402
- What do you want out of this therapy?
- We...

101
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,804
I want to save
your marriage.

102
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,812
- Yeah, me too, yeah.
- Right.

103
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:33,347
Talking about our problems
is the first step.

104
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,488
You can tell me anything.

105
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:39,853
And hopefully you two can
learn to communicate honestly.

106
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,857
What's the problem?

107
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:45,657
Well... Danny and me...

108
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,593
we haven't been...

109
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:52,505
familiar with
each other in a while.

110
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,735
- Familiar?
- Intimate.

111
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,309
- No sexual intercourse?
- Jesus, lady.

112
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:00,844
What about oral sex
or mutual masturbation?

113
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:03,812
Let's go, we don't need
to see some shrink.

114
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,713
No, I think we do, Dan.

115
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,354
- He has a problem with...
- Don't! Come on, why?

116
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:12,322
''Mr. Happy''.

117
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,626
- ''Mr. Happy''?
- His penis.

118
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:19,424
You said it. I can't get
my penis to stand up.

119
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:23,694
I'm impotent or something.
I can't wake the baby.

120
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,873
I... I can't get a hard on.
Is everybody happy now? We can go?

121
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:29,072
- Dan is impotent.
- Only with me.

122
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,073
- That was an accident.
- He accidentally...

123
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,247
...screwed that waitress.
- I thought he couldn't get an erection.

124
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:37,542
- So did I.
- She's been so depressed.

125
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:41,781
It's pretty depressing when you
can't excite your own husband.

126
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,524
Great, we've made
some real progress.

127
00:10:56,737 --> 00:11:00,036
All those who are in favor
raise your hands.

128
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:09,211
Dr. Paige, you may
rejoin the group.

129
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,790
Dr. Paige, it is the
duty of this committee...

130
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,830
to defend the integrity
of the Psychiatric arts...

131
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:30,533
in the Boise area.

132
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,329
Dr. Paige...

133
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,872
if we allow bus-bench
advertising, what's next?

134
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:39,568
Billboards? Cable TV?

135
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,042
Following our laws
pertaining to advertising...

136
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,810
the fine is set
in US$ 250.

137
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,320
Roger!

138
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:56,690
Hello, Emily.
Sorry about the fine.

139
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:59,229
It's only 250 bucks.
I'll write it off.

140
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:02,627
Besides, I already got some
clients from the bus bench.

141
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:06,272
I was thinking about you
the other day.

142
00:12:06,773 --> 00:12:09,173
- Me? Really?
- Are you seeing anyone new?

143
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:13,404
- I'm still married.
- I meant patients.

144
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:17,380
There's a woman I'd like you
to see. She's very depressed.

145
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:21,076
Her depression is at the root of her
sexual problems with her husband.

146
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:25,122
- You could really help her.
- I'm not really adding patients.

147
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:28,393
You talked about how great
it'd be to collaborate.

148
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:31,587
The couple is perfect. Marriage is
on the rocks. I'll take the boy...

149
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,232
you'll take the girl,
we can confer and strategize.

150
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:36,868
And together help them save
their marriage.

151
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,432
How is your wife?

152
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,736
Okay. And your husband?
The new one?

153
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,805
He's my new ex.
I moved out last weekend.

154
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:49,911
Really?
Just like that?

155
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:54,019
Just like that. It's for the
best. So, what do you say?

156
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:58,055
There's nothing else to say.
Dan's gone off me.

157
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,249
This is a waste of time.

158
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,020
Okay, I feel like we're stuck.

159
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,095
Melinda,
I want you to see a colleague.

160
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:07,665
- Are you giving up on me?
- I want you to see Dr. Klink...

161
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:10,200
he's a depression expert.

162
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:14,807
- From the old school.
- What's a depression expert?

163
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:32,622
What a cliché!

164
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:36,626
First the affair in Denver,
then the red Corvette.

165
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,230
What's next?
Face lifts and liposuction?

166
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,165
Desire fades.

167
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:46,496
Who is she?

168
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:50,399
Is it your new receptionist?

169
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,737
You think
I need a liposuction?

170
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:56,006
You're not rehashing
Denver, are you? Are you?

171
00:13:56,216 --> 00:14:00,516
- Are you screwing Dr. Rice again?
- No, there's no one.

172
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:05,081
We are not happy.

173
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:07,920
Go to hell, Roger.

174
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,500
Asshole.

175
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:57,438
The door, please.

176
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,518
Unsafe at any speed.

177
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,720
- The elevator?
- No, your Corvette.

178
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:19,126
Unsafe at any speed.

179
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,229
That's a Corvair.
Unsafe at any speed.

180
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:30,940
It looks just like a Corvette.

181
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:38,543
- Funky elevator.
- I try not to speak, I got stuck once.

182
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,511
- By yourself?
- Yeah.

183
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:45,919
How boring.

184
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:50,090
Is that why you carry
a change of clothes?

185
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:53,793
Oh, this? No.

186
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:03,007
I left my wife,
just now, this morning.

187
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,145
You're kidding.

188
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:25,729
- Is this your floor?
- Yes.

189
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:27,797
I'm here to see Dr. Klick.

190
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:31,232
He's an old fashion
depression expert.

191
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:33,338
You mean Dr. Klink?

192
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,701
- Yes.
- I'm Dr. Klink.

193
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:39,140
You are Dr. Klink?
You're kidding?

194
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:42,611
I pictured a bald-head,
long-face pointy beard.

195
00:16:43,216 --> 00:16:45,650
Who called me
old fashioned?

196
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:48,377
Doctor Paige.

197
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:51,182
You mean Emily?

198
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:56,093
Well... Anyway,
I'll see you inside.

199
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:58,230
Inside and out, I suppose.

200
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:04,101
Inside...
In my office.

201
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:20,853
This is my door.

202
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,984
Patients go in that
door down there.

203
00:17:29,663 --> 00:17:30,652
Wait.

204
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,163
Your tie is crooked.

205
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:38,701
I guess your wife didn't check
you before you left the house.

206
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:51,617
Just... go right in.

207
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,083
Tuesday...

208
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:00,588
Goddamn it.

209
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:05,458
Dr. Klink?
Your 9:45 is here.

210
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:12,361
Test: one, two, one two.
Test: one, two, three.

211
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:13,900
Shit.

212
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:15,938
Sorry.

213
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:30,322
- It's very cold in here.
- Really?

214
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:34,391
- You'll need to remember a sweater.
- No, no, I meant the decor.

215
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:38,086
It's so blue.

216
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:40,163
Alrighty.

217
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,192
Mrs. Carmichael,
would you like to sit here?

218
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:46,668
- Is that where you want me to sit?
- I don't want you to sit...

219
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,170
anywhere.

220
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:54,245
I see. What happened to that friendly
man I met on the elevator?

221
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,748
Look, we had an inappropriate
introduction, but...

222
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:03,047
- Is that what we had?
- Yes.

223
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,723
Please.

224
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,263
So?

225
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:18,903
- Why are you here?
- I'm trying to save my marriage.

226
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:25,035
I've been so depressed lately,
I think it'll pass, but it doesn't.

227
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:26,940
You're a little hanged up
one morning...

228
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:30,548
then suddenly you're
on a shrink's lab... Chair.

229
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:41,225
Well, you don't seem very
depressed right this moment.

230
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,756
I'm not. I was.

231
00:19:43,963 --> 00:19:45,487
I almost didn't get off
the elevator.

232
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:49,467
It's pretty depressing to think you
need to see a depression expert.

233
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:52,729
My marriage expert's been
divorced three times.

234
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:57,433
- You must be really depressed.
- Let's...

235
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,375
Why don't you...?
Tell me more about you.

236
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:11,789
I'm married to a man
who doesn't get turned on by me.

237
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:19,260
- Do you blame me?
- Why would I blame you?

238
00:20:19,466 --> 00:20:22,958
Not me, him. I asked if
you blamed your husband.

239
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,697
- No, you said ''me''.
- Well, I meant...

240
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:32,002
...your husband, of course.
- Of course.

241
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,942
Dan started sleeping
in the living room on the couch...

242
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:37,309
that's the beginning
of the end, don't you think?

243
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:46,284
It certainly suggests
a lack of intimacy.

244
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,359
We stopped being intimate
almost two years ago.

245
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:57,159
- I shouldn't tell you this.
- No.

246
00:20:57,871 --> 00:21:00,806
- Dr. Klink.
- No, no, please, sit.

247
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:03,841
I...

248
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:07,836
You can tell me anything.

249
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:09,912
Really.

250
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:15,344
Continue.

251
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:19,382
One night, I get up
to use the bathroom...

252
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:21,287
and I looked in on Dan.

253
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:23,860
He sleeps in his boxers,
and it was a hot night...

254
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:29,262
the covers were off,
so I could see his ''Mr. Happy''.

255
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:32,596
- ''Mr. Happy''?
- His thingy.

256
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:36,401
- His pe... member.
- Peeking out.

257
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,902
So I decided to try
a little experiment...

258
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:43,412
...to see if Dan was broken
or if he'd just gone off me.

259
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:46,346
An experiment?

260
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:54,025
I snuck up
on my knees...

261
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:57,788
and with my mouth I...

262
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:03,193
kissed ''Mr. Happy''.

263
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:13,439
But when I tried
to make love, he... his...

264
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:16,911
It fizzled away when he woke
up and realized it was me.

265
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:20,051
- Dan's gone off me.
- Desire fades.

266
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:23,552
That... that is a
depressing thought.

267
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:26,890
Yes. It...

268
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:28,690
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:32,059
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:35,928
I'm in a transitional
phase in my life.

271
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:39,664
I'm not taking on
any more patients.

272
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:43,703
- But you've helped me already.
- Really, I can't.

273
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,105
If there are two shrinks
in a small town...

274
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:51,215
and one was crazy and the other
sane which one would you go to see?

275
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:54,181
- I've never heard this...
- You'd go to the crazy one...

276
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:56,048
'cause if there were only
two in the town...

277
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:59,419
you'd wanna see the one
who'd helped the other one.

278
00:22:59,626 --> 00:23:03,528
You mean, there if there
were just two...? I see.

279
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,756
- Dr. Klink, your 10:30 is here.
- Do you hear that?

280
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,161
I mean, I would love...

281
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:15,501
to just sit here
and talk with you...

282
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,343
all afternoon...

283
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:23,875
but if I run even 5 minutes
over on one session...

284
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,813
my whole week
could be thrown off.

285
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,250
Hell, the rest of my life.

286
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:34,518
I'd gladly recommend
to you someone else.

287
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:40,723
This is a list of qualified mental
health professional's in Boise.

288
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,412
Melinda!

289
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,884
Dr. Klink,
what are you doing?

290
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,789
- I'm chasing after you.
- What about your 10:30?

291
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:13,056
No, I just...

292
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:20,003
I've left my wife...

293
00:24:20,206 --> 00:24:24,575
and, since you are not
my patient and since this...

294
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:28,975
this isn't my office.

295
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:49,064
It's stuck again.

296
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:52,332
- Dr. Klink.
- Yeah. Roger.

297
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,733
This is so therapeutic.

298
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:58,001
No, you should not
call me Dr. Klink.

299
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:01,612
We could give
the wrong impression.

300
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:05,881
But I feel so free and open.

301
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:10,249
I wish Dan had come with me maybe
he could benefit from your expertise.

302
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:13,186
- I don't feel depressed at all!
- Don't talk.

303
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:25,798
Are you folks okay?
You seem out of breath.

304
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,269
- See you next week, Dr. Klink.
- Roger.

305
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:35,904
I'm not actually
her doctor, it's...

306
00:25:38,284 --> 00:25:40,650
a figure of speech.

307
00:25:46,926 --> 00:25:48,553
He is a genius.

308
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:51,753
His method is so subtle.
It sneaked right up on me.

309
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:56,758
- What did he do exactly?
- He got me to talk.

310
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,164
- Sort of.
- How many sessions have you had?

311
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:00,798
Just one.

312
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,501
What a man.

313
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,905
He is a genius.

314
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:10,549
Hey, what about my needs?
Am I part of this therapy stuff or what?

315
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:14,182
Alright.

316
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:20,648
- ''Mastering Masturbation''?
- It's a wonderful guide.

317
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,853
Techniques, fantasy games,
lubricants, all in historical context.

318
00:26:25,064 --> 00:26:27,726
Did you know that Edison
was an avid masturbator?

319
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,731
It's where he got
his best ideas.

320
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,131
Edison stole his best ideas.

321
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,329
Whatever,
maybe it was Einstein.

322
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:36,903
You look fabulous.

323
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:48,352
Possible disrotation subject.
Orgasms and happiness.

324
00:26:48,554 --> 00:26:51,421
Why is it all the
world seems rosy?

325
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:55,025
It's Dr. Paige,
regarding Melinda.

326
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:59,357
- I'll call her back.
- She's on her way in.

327
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:02,898
Son of a bitch, I cannot believe
what you did with Melinda.

328
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:05,971
- She told you?
- Told me? It's all over her face.

329
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,064
I never took any money.

330
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:11,368
And all I did was
a preliminary interview...

331
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:14,307
It's absolutely wonderful.

332
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,516
- Really?
- The big challenge is to get...

333
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:21,380
these people to reconnect
emotionally and sexually.

334
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:24,181
- Can I buy you lunch?
- Today?

335
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,858
I'm seeing Mrs. Carmichael.

336
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,021
During lunch time?

337
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:33,323
- Oh, Dr. Klink.
- Roger, Roger.

338
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,058
Call me Roger.

339
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,234
Oh, Dr. Klink.

340
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:43,134
Look, a helicopter.

341
00:27:53,252 --> 00:27:56,744
Maybe it was a transplant.

342
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,579
What?

343
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,588
The helicopter...

344
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:04,320
was carrying
a little ice chest...

345
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,293
with a red cross on it.

346
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:11,766
Imagine waking up with
a whole new heart, Dr. Klink.

347
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:15,429
Please, call me Roger.

348
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:20,669
Oh, Danny and me used to
have so much in common.

349
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,782
Everything we did
together was making love.

350
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:29,512
Not just sex but
cooking together...

351
00:28:29,722 --> 00:28:33,385
and we took a trip
to Salt Lake City.

352
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:39,190
And he was like my big
brother and my friend...

353
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:42,492
...and my lover, all...
- We have to talk...

354
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:47,264
I just... I've got
patients all afternoon.

355
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:52,001
I'm just trying to tell
you that I felt so good...

356
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:56,773
since last week session
that I told Danny about us.

357
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:59,008
- What?
- Yes.

358
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:01,083
You told your
husband about us?

359
00:29:03,122 --> 00:29:04,851
Oh, my God!

360
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:08,652
It was amazing, spontaneous,
like we used to be.

361
00:29:08,861 --> 00:29:13,560
- What did I do to deserve this?
- You screwed that cocktail waitress.

362
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:17,327
But it wasn't spontaneous,
or amazing.

363
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,764
You shouldn't have told him.

364
00:29:18,971 --> 00:29:22,737
- You talked about honesty.
- No. Dr. Paige talks about honesty.

365
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:27,572
I'm still on the fence, some lying is
good. You didn't give details.

366
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:30,739
Wow, elevator sex.

367
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,510
Damn, I've always admired
Melinda's spunk.

368
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,744
- Larry.
- Now you're even, bro.

369
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:38,848
- How did he take it?
- He followed me here.

370
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:41,322
He what?

371
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,661
Very nice, he's what?

372
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,003
Look!

373
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:02,381
Melinda, I...

374
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,947
It's over. You and me.

375
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,881
Dan needs you, he loves you.
He followed you here.

376
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:11,352
Isn't that romantic?
Listen...

377
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:16,187
take what you've gotten out of our
time together focus it back on Dan.

378
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:19,057
Are you saying that as
my lover or my therapist?

379
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:24,396
Therapist. I mean, if I was
your therapist, which I'm not.

380
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:27,095
We have nothing in common.
This isn't a relationship...

381
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:30,764
based on mutual respect
or understanding...

382
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:33,673
it's based on
sex, that's all.

383
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,210
Take it.

384
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:37,143
My God, we come from
different worlds.

385
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:41,616
I've got a Ph.D., you'd barely
graduated from high school.

386
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:43,846
I have an AA from
Boise Community College...

387
00:30:44,056 --> 00:30:46,718
and a certificate
on physical therapy.

388
00:30:46,926 --> 00:30:50,657
Exactly. The two of you are
more suited. You're perfect.

389
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:55,493
Go home to...
What's his...? Dan!

390
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:06,773
Divorced? But you two
were doing much better.

391
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:10,210
I wish you'd never sent me
to see Dr. Klink.

392
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:14,477
- Therapy can be very intense.
- Especially oral therapy.

393
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:18,179
- Dan, don't be crass.
- Crass?

394
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:21,053
- You had to have sex in an elevator.
- What? Who did?

395
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,989
Dr. Klink and me.

396
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:24,924
You slept with Dr. Klink
in an elevator?

397
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:27,656
Like a couple of dogs
in heat they slept.

398
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:31,534
You're disgusting. I didn't have to bend
over backwards to get him aroused.

399
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:33,967
I thought that's what you did do.

400
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:36,539
Bastard,
I wanted this to work out.

401
00:31:36,742 --> 00:31:40,405
- Was the elevator your idea or his?
- Does it matter?

402
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:42,538
You son of a bitch.

403
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:45,342
In the elevator.
In the elevator.

404
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,315
Emily, it just happened.
She wasn't technically my patient.

405
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,920
Save it for the board!

406
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:53,057
- You didn't tell the board?
- Of course I told the board.

407
00:31:54,493 --> 00:31:56,984
This is outrageous.

408
00:31:57,196 --> 00:32:00,256
- Kindly keep your voice down.
- The amount is regulated by...

409
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,934
the bar laws. Specifically,
number 47 calls...

410
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:06,536
for fines of up to US$25
for inappropriate behavior.

411
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:10,869
Inappropriate behavior? He was having
sex with his patient in an elevator.

412
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:13,011
She wasn't technically
his patient.

413
00:32:13,212 --> 00:32:15,442
The minute she walks into
his office she was his patient.

414
00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:17,548
No, technically
she was your patient.

415
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,651
- My patient?
- I think the fine is fair.

416
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:23,822
I was fined 250 bucks for
advertising on a bus bench...

417
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:26,821
he's fined 25 dollars
for screwing in an elevator.

418
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:31,224
Law 17 is very specific to
permissible outdoor advertising.

419
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,795
A hooker costs more than that.

420
00:32:32,998 --> 00:32:35,694
- Dr. Paige, that's enough.
- It's more than enough.

421
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:38,559
Who should I make
the check out to?

422
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:41,433
All you had to do is call me,
why didn't you?

423
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,201
- I'm sorry, Emily.
- You will be.

424
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,054
I really am sorry, Emily.
This is over.

425
00:32:57,256 --> 00:32:59,383
You're not off the hook,
you will lose everything...

426
00:32:59,592 --> 00:33:02,459
money, your license,
by the time this is over...

427
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,892
you will never practice again.

428
00:33:06,098 --> 00:33:08,157
- What are you gonna do?
- NOSTA.

429
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:09,356
NOSTA?

430
00:33:15,808 --> 00:33:18,606
- What the heck is a NOSTA?
- N-O-S-T-A.

431
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:22,076
The National Organization
to Stop Therapist Abuse.

432
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:26,445
National? I don't know.
I really just want Danny back.

433
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:29,086
We need to teach him
a lesson.

434
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:31,085
- Danny?
- Hi, Mel.

435
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,588
Okay, let me do
all the talking.

436
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,124
What law school you said
you went to?

437
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,990
Careful, you sent my
vulnerable sister-in-law...

438
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:42,725
...into the arms of that Dr. Krink.
- It's Klink, Larry, and shut up.

439
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,166
You should've talked to me
before you called them.

440
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:50,206
We're gonna nail that son
of a bitch. There she is.

441
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:54,142
Consuelo N. Barker
Barker & Barker...

442
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:58,077
who represent NOSTA.
I'm the second Barker; Connie.

443
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,481
- You must be the victim.
- Lawrence P. Carmichael, ABD.

444
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:04,451
I'll be handling
all negotiations.

445
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:07,990
Let me remind you, you're the first
group we've contacted...

446
00:34:08,194 --> 00:34:10,788
so we're looking for a
competitive figure which...

447
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:16,161
will act as a detour to other
groups we may be inclined to go...

448
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:17,858
to.

449
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,765
ABD?

450
00:34:19,972 --> 00:34:22,532
- All But Degree. My client...
- Take a powder, Lawrence...

451
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:24,936
this is a serious situation.
You're way out of your league.

452
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:28,941
- Take your pet monkey with you.
- Just a second.

453
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:30,775
That's my husband.

454
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:33,451
I need to speak
to you privately.

455
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:36,180
It's precisely this
cases that we must win.

456
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:38,720
We need to send out a message,
a strong message.

457
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:41,085
We'll prove that he took advantage
of your fragile ego...

458
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:44,394
and lured you into ''psycho
sexual emotional bondage''.

459
00:34:44,597 --> 00:34:46,997
- Psycho what?
- He's a master manipulator.

460
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,158
- It's that quiet lost puppy quality.
- I felt an attraction for Dr. Klink.

461
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,271
Transference. There's strong
feelings that the patient, you...

462
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:56,668
erroneously transfers
to a therapist, Dr. Klink...

463
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:00,072
but which in fact originated
out of earlier relationships.

464
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:03,510
Like with my husband, maybe.

465
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:08,080
Perhaps an even earlier
relationship.

466
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,323
Where did this immoral
congress transpired?

467
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:15,322
- Immoral congress?
- In an elevator.

468
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:18,018
- Elevator sex?
- And in his office.

469
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,891
- And on his couch.
- And on the desk.

470
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,691
Why did you go to Dr. Klink?

471
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,701
She sent me to him, said he'd take
care of me in the old fashioned way.

472
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:31,068
He's a specialist,
a depression expert.

473
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:33,302
We met at a communication
conference...

474
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:35,446
- We'll get it all in a deposition.
- My deposition?

475
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:39,778
You're a key witness. Okay,
let's skip the elevator for now.

476
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:44,251
- Take me through this couch copula.
- Well, it's a little embarrassing.

477
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:46,287
We started on the desk.

478
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,585
Have you ever heard
the name Ezri Stovall?

479
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,726
He's the malpractice insurance
go to guy in this region.

480
00:35:53,265 --> 00:35:56,098
He rarely loses,
he never settles.

481
00:35:56,302 --> 00:35:58,600
He will be ruthless.

482
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:01,739
Now I know this is difficult but
it's important that you recall...

483
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,343
the exact details and
specific sequence of events.

484
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,479
Well, it's a little hazy.

485
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:12,048
But I know he...
Dr. Klink went down on me.

486
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:13,741
Cunnilingus?

487
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,647
- Are you okay?
- What else did he do?

488
00:36:15,854 --> 00:36:18,118
- I went down on him.
- Fellatio?

489
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:21,657
We don't wanna play this oral sex
card. It's illegal in this state.

490
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:23,521
- It is?
- It's sodomy.

491
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:25,060
Oral sex is sodomy?

492
00:36:25,264 --> 00:36:28,961
To carnally know any male or female
person by the anus or mouth.

493
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:31,796
- It's a misdemeanor.
- I don't wanna hurt Dr. Klink.

494
00:36:32,004 --> 00:36:33,801
I just wanted to
save my marriage.

495
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:37,533
Dr. Klink made me realize how much
Danny and me have in common.

496
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:41,005
We'll crush Dr. Klink.
Look at you.

497
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:43,272
My God, just look at you.

498
00:36:43,482 --> 00:36:46,849
Dr. Paige is right. You're a poor
pathetic woman. He's destroyed you.

499
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:54,524
Nice shot.

500
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:59,555
- Mind if I sit?
- It's a free bar.

501
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:05,569
That lawyer thinks a divorce
would be great for our case.

502
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:07,671
I don't want to divorce, Mel.

503
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:09,465
- No?
- No.

504
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:13,502
I just want you
to stop seeing him.

505
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:18,873
I'm not seeing him. So, you
don't want to split up?

506
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:24,112
No! Not at all, we can't
split up. You and I...

507
00:37:24,323 --> 00:37:26,883
we are like a team.
Sigfrid and Roy, Hall and Oates...

508
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,821
ham and cheese.

509
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:31,825
I'm sorry I strayed, but
you kind of opened the door.

510
00:37:32,264 --> 00:37:35,358
- I wanted to talk. The truth...
- Let's not talk about it.

511
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:39,628
Water down the drain, Dan.
Water down the drain.

512
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,515
How's that divorce coming?

513
00:37:51,717 --> 00:37:55,346
Please, counsel, let's not lose
sight of the human element.

514
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:58,756
A divorce would
really help our case.

515
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:01,221
I'm on it.

516
00:38:01,894 --> 00:38:05,091
Joel Johnson Jr. He's with
Beerquist, Angsthall & Cox.

517
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:08,289
Joel is our
point man here in...

518
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:12,402
- Boise.
- Boise.

519
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:15,038
Joel's come up with a figure.

520
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,403
How much money
were you hoping to see?

521
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:28,348
US$30 thousand?

522
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:32,046
Million. It's US$30 million.

523
00:38:32,257 --> 00:38:34,919
- US$30 million?
- US$30 million?

524
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:38,392
You've hit the jackpot,
Melinda.

525
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:43,330
- Dr. Klink doesn't have US$ 30 million.
- He has a malpractice insurance...

526
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,799
...and they've got U$30 million.
- God!

527
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:48,370
I had no idea it
would be so much.

528
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:50,769
There's not a better person
she could've screwed.

529
00:38:50,976 --> 00:38:55,242
Except a priest. Catholics would pay
a lot of money to keep this crap down.

530
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:58,439
I'm gonna get 30 million dollars
for having sex with him?

531
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,447
- In an elevator.
- And on his desk.

532
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:04,516
- US$30 million.
- Minus 30% contingency.

533
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:06,190
50% if we went on appeal.

534
00:39:06,592 --> 00:39:10,494
How much more do you think
a divorce might add?

535
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:27,378
Why the hell
are you suing me?

536
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:30,137
Because...

537
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:33,576
you took advantage
of my fragile ego...

538
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:37,084
and got me in a psycho
emotional sexual thing.

539
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,415
- What?
- Take a walk, or I'll call the cops.

540
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,821
If it isn't the erection
wonder ''Mr. Happy''.

541
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:47,824
- You told him about ''Mr. Happy''?
- I told you that in therapy.

542
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,694
First of all: it's Roger.

543
00:39:49,902 --> 00:39:52,530
Secondly: it wasn't therapy,
you were never my patient.

544
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,763
Tell that to the judge,
''Mr. Majestic''.

545
00:39:56,275 --> 00:40:01,144
- You told him about ''Mr. Majestic''?
- He's my husband, I tell him everything.

546
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:04,873
- Are you screwing yet?
- There's more than sex.

547
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,607
There better be with
Mr. Limpy here.

548
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:11,281
- Son of a bitch!
- Danny!

549
00:40:14,226 --> 00:40:15,625
Come on.

550
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:18,626
I hope you fight better.

551
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:22,029
Let go.

552
00:40:22,234 --> 00:40:24,293
Come on, Klink, come on.

553
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:27,768
- Why'd you tell him about Mr. Happy?
- It's okay, he's a doctor.

554
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:31,403
Don't sue me, Melinda. I'll lose
my license, it's all I have.

555
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:34,803
I'm sorry.
Good-bye, Dr. Klink.

556
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:37,573
Roger, call me Roger.

557
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,852
Ezri Stovall will crush
her like a bug.

558
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:54,330
We've got to stop this kind
of frivolous litigation.

559
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:58,060
People have to start taking
responsibility for their actions.

560
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,295
Why'd you stop
sleeping together?

561
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:02,803
Makes it seem like you were
doing something wrong.

562
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:07,107
Is a taboo, a therapist can
never have sex with a patient.

563
00:41:07,613 --> 00:41:09,444
The moment you two screwed...

564
00:41:09,648 --> 00:41:14,176
she became your lover, thereby,
making it impossible...

565
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:16,946
for her to ever be your patient.

566
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:19,988
- Where did you bone her?
- We made love in an elevator.

567
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:24,652
Elevator sex?
You're kidding me.

568
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,467
- I'm in elevators all the time.
- I know, I'm sorry.

569
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:33,334
- How long would that take?
- It was over pretty quick.

570
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:36,302
- Mechanical failure?
- No, she hit the stop.

571
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:42,544
Or maybe I did.
Is this really important?

572
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:44,978
Every detail is important.

573
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,208
Do you need booze?

574
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:49,319
Juries are fickle.

575
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:52,649
Something could come out of
the trial and you'd be screwed.

576
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:54,416
Any witnesses?

577
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:56,457
- Other passengers?
- Of course not.

578
00:41:56,662 --> 00:41:59,426
- How about a surveillance camera?
- Oh, Jesus.

579
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,659
There may not be one
if the building is old.

580
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:08,732
- Please, God.
- Okay. So, you boned her.

581
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:12,002
Did you ejaculate?

582
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:17,441
- Is there anyway not to?
- Not that I've found.

583
00:42:19,818 --> 00:42:22,582
Did she mention any other
therapists she'd slept with?

584
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:25,079
Other members of the
Hippocratic arts?

585
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,226
Orthodontists,
podiatrists, clergy?

586
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:32,920
- I don't know. I don't think so.
- What about you?

587
00:42:33,398 --> 00:42:35,832
How many other non-patient
patients have you banged?

588
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:37,558
- None.
- Your receptionist?

589
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:39,464
Tiffany? No!

590
00:42:39,671 --> 00:42:43,732
Well, let Ezri
Stovall get to work.

591
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:51,377
Clammy.

592
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:59,015
Don't answer, baby.

593
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:09,157
- Helen, Ezri.
- Hi, what's up?

594
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,857
I've got something for you.
Are you free?

595
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:13,731
Available, never free.

596
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:16,339
Never give it away, baby.

597
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:20,170
Is that son of a bitch Stovall?
She's spoken for!

598
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:22,642
This is business.

599
00:43:22,848 --> 00:43:26,443
I'm defending a head-shrinker who put
his pecker where he shouldn't have.

600
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:30,280
- And she's suing him.
- Bingo.

601
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,481
- Don't get it, baby.
- Hold on.

602
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:37,651
- You haven't worked in a month.
- I can't, I'm gonna...

603
00:43:44,703 --> 00:43:48,605
- Is Felix Potter in?
- He sure is.

604
00:43:49,608 --> 00:43:51,838
Goddamn!

605
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:55,943
Felix Potter?

606
00:43:56,148 --> 00:44:00,517
Connie Barker of Chicago, Joel
Johnson gave me your number.

607
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:02,084
I'm looking for a private
investigator...

608
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:04,517
I'm representing a victim
in a therapist abuse case.

609
00:44:04,723 --> 00:44:05,917
What do you want?

610
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:09,184
I need you to find out if
there's anything bad in his past.

611
00:44:09,394 --> 00:44:11,419
We're just starting
depositions.

612
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,619
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

613
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,662
- Nothing, radio.
- Nothing, TV.

614
00:44:14,866 --> 00:44:16,390
- His name's Roger Klink.
- Melinda Carmichael.

615
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:19,502
- Roger Klink.
- Dr. Klink?

616
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:22,832
- What's her name?
- Melinda Carmichael.

617
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:24,338
You'll get your usual fee.

618
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:29,071
Felix, I need some dirt
on Dr. Klink.

619
00:44:29,648 --> 00:44:33,607
Fax me everything you've
got, Ezri. I gotta go. Bye.

620
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:37,220
Interested. 50 bucks
an hour plus expenses.

621
00:44:37,422 --> 00:44:39,356
Fax me at this number...

622
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:41,458
Fax...

623
00:44:45,597 --> 00:44:48,862
We're working
in the same job again.

624
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:52,036
You show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

625
00:44:55,707 --> 00:44:59,438
Have you ever had your
deposition taken before?

626
00:44:59,711 --> 00:45:02,339
Do you understand, that
your testimony here today...

627
00:45:02,547 --> 00:45:05,846
is giving under oath
just like in court?

628
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:08,949
So, despite
the informal setting...

629
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:13,318
you're testifying under
penalty of perjury.

630
00:45:15,327 --> 00:45:18,660
I'm sorry, the tape jammed.
I need a minute.

631
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:24,266
It's his first day.

632
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,634
Is he gonna be here everyday?

633
00:45:31,843 --> 00:45:33,435
That's right.

634
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:38,379
Got it.

635
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:40,014
Now, Mrs. Carmichael...

636
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:42,218
were you carnally intimate
with Roger Klink?

637
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,287
- Carnally intimate?
- Sexually intimate.

638
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,558
I guess so.

639
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,025
I mean... we had sex.

640
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,255
Would you please describe
in specific detail...

641
00:45:54,466 --> 00:45:56,696
the first of these decorous
unions with Roger Klink?

642
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:58,529
Indecorous unions.

643
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:01,297
Consenting adults
engaging fornication.

644
00:46:01,506 --> 00:46:03,667
What could be more
decorous, counselor?

645
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:06,275
How about if for the purposes
of this deposition...

646
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:09,470
we let the noun stand
alone, unqualified?

647
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:11,945
''Union'', plane and simple.

648
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,052
Fine. Mrs. Carmichael, would you
please walk me through...

649
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:18,620
...this initial union?
- What?

650
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:23,317
Describe your first
encounter with Dr. Klink.

651
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:25,052
Roger... Klink.

652
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:29,393
- He is a doctor, counsel.
- Yes, counsel. But not her doctor.

653
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:32,764
How about if for the
purposes of this deposition...

654
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:36,202
we let the Klink
stand alone, unqualified?

655
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:38,910
Fine.

656
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:43,314
Mrs. Carmichael,
when you are ready.

657
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:49,184
Well, we had...

658
00:46:49,387 --> 00:46:54,484
sex in the elevator of his
building, between floors.

659
00:46:55,794 --> 00:46:58,592
And would you describe
this union as standard?

660
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:01,732
- Where are you getting at?
- I'm trying to establish...

661
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,992
the mode by which they currently
express themselves.

662
00:47:04,202 --> 00:47:06,466
The way in which they were
currently expressive?

663
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:07,933
Precisely.

664
00:47:08,139 --> 00:47:12,735
Missionary, front door,
back door, roundly-round?

665
00:47:12,944 --> 00:47:15,504
Were you prostrated?
Plumbed?

666
00:47:15,714 --> 00:47:17,341
Any other?

667
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:21,952
Well, he stopped the elevator...

668
00:47:22,554 --> 00:47:26,388
and we just kind of
moved at each other.

669
00:47:26,591 --> 00:47:30,254
Did he stop the elevator,
or did you?

670
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:32,826
One of us did,
it's a little hazy.

671
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:35,522
Okay, but you made
the first move.

672
00:47:35,734 --> 00:47:36,860
You're leading the
plaintive, counsel.

673
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:42,805
We both moved at the same time.
Grabbed at each other...

674
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:48,743
He was very excited.

675
00:47:51,016 --> 00:47:52,881
Klink told you
he was excited?

676
00:47:53,084 --> 00:47:56,713
No, but I could feel his...

677
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,253
well, his...

678
00:47:59,457 --> 00:48:02,654
''Mr. Happy'' was
pressing up against me.

679
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:04,021
''Mr. Happy''?

680
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:07,289
That's what my
husband calls his...

681
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:09,926
- Johnson.
- Yes, counsel.

682
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:18,971
Not you. I'm referring to
Melinda's husband's Johnson.

683
00:48:19,177 --> 00:48:21,407
Klink's Johnson...
Klink's penis.

684
00:48:21,613 --> 00:48:24,207
Could we stay focused on Klink's
penis and not the husband's.

685
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:28,715
Mrs. Carmichael...

686
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,081
perhaps there's another term
we could use to describe...

687
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:34,087
Roger Klink's penis.

688
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:38,024
''Mr. Majestic'', that's
what he calls it.

689
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:44,298
Why didn't you tell me your pecker
has a name? And that she knows it.

690
00:48:44,502 --> 00:48:47,062
I didn't think it'd come up.

691
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:54,111
I had an affair
three years ago.

692
00:48:54,312 --> 00:48:56,974
I mean, with a
doctor in Denver.

693
00:48:57,515 --> 00:49:00,040
If I hadn't have that affair
I would've never bought the...

694
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:02,776
...Corvette or left my wife.
- Are you still seeing him?

695
00:49:02,987 --> 00:49:06,423
- Him? It was a her. She-doctor.
- Alright.

696
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:09,286
It doesn't have any
bearing on this case.

697
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:13,225
It better not.

698
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:20,064
Back on the record, please.

699
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:23,035
Okay, so you could feel
''Dr. Majestic''.

700
00:49:23,241 --> 00:49:25,732
I think it's
''Mr. Majestic'', counsel.

701
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:32,481
Right. You could feel ''Mr. Majestic''
pressing up against you.

702
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,675
What happened next?

703
00:49:35,987 --> 00:49:38,785
We started kissing
and grabbing...

704
00:49:39,557 --> 00:49:45,496
and he was bumping
himself up against me...

705
00:49:46,598 --> 00:49:49,761
kissing my neck and...

706
00:49:49,968 --> 00:49:53,495
he slid his hands
under my blouse...

707
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:58,401
and was caressing
my breast in circles.

708
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:01,738
Tiny little circles.

709
00:50:01,946 --> 00:50:05,677
And one thing
led to another...

710
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:08,648
and I just...

711
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:12,584
took ''Mr. Majestic''...

712
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:19,190
in my mouth.

713
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:23,834
You son of a bitch!

714
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,029
- Dr. Paige!
- Danny!

715
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:33,672
- Stop it.
- You son of a bitch! How dare you?

716
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:36,176
How dare you?

717
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:39,013
Are you okay?

718
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,818
I'm alright. I'm alright.

719
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,351
Out, out!

720
00:50:44,222 --> 00:50:45,883
I'm sorry.

721
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:50,286
Stop it!
lmmature peckerwoods!

722
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:55,523
Oh, hilarity!
She kissed his pipi.

723
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,293
Grow up!

724
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:01,370
This is serious
goddamned business!

725
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:03,268
Seditious, yes.

726
00:51:03,474 --> 00:51:06,409
Scandalous, of course.
Titillating, possibly...

727
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:07,942
but my client's
career hangs on...

728
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:11,741
Miss Barker's client's
most intimate testimonial.

729
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:16,114
Get out and stay out until it's
time of your depositions!

730
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:17,754
Mine?
Why would I need to do one?

731
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:21,187
You're the flaccid bastard
that started this whole mess.

732
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:23,019
- Now beat it!
- He is...

733
00:51:23,228 --> 00:51:27,062
- Ditto! Or I'll scream!
- I'm going.

734
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:34,567
Beautifully expressed,
counsel.

735
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,010
- That shit's hot.
- Shut up, Larry!

736
00:51:45,216 --> 00:51:47,241
You're not looking
at the big picture.

737
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:52,082
The three, zero, zero zero,
zero, zero zero, zero dollar...

738
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,659
Enough!
Give it a rest, Larry, okay?

739
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:59,890
This is all your fault!

740
00:52:00,098 --> 00:52:02,566
My fault?
You're the one that sent...

741
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:05,861
...my wife to that sex feaster.
- I'll catch you later, bro.

742
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,630
I... I forgot something.

743
00:52:09,274 --> 00:52:12,209
If you'd been able to deliver the
goods she wouldn't be so damn...

744
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:15,174
...horny that she
threw herself to him.

745
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,678
- Fuck you, Dr. Paige.
- Fuck me?

746
00:52:17,882 --> 00:52:21,215
How are you gonna do that,
with Dr. Klink's help?

747
00:52:21,552 --> 00:52:23,110
No.

748
00:52:24,656 --> 00:52:28,023
We came to you because we
wanted to save our marriage.

749
00:52:28,226 --> 00:52:30,626
You're professionals
and you don't know anything.

750
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:33,296
You wanna know why you can't
get an erection with Melinda?

751
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:36,532
- Why?
- No protection, no erection.

752
00:52:36,734 --> 00:52:38,759
No diaphragm,
''Mr. Happy'' gets sad.

753
00:52:39,203 --> 00:52:42,798
Wife wants children, husband
doesn't. Wife forces the issue.

754
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:46,135
It is a classic
Venus and Mars dynamic.

755
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:50,781
Generally, we like patients to come
to certain conclusion on their own.

756
00:52:50,982 --> 00:52:54,748
But what the hell,
there it is, free of charge.

757
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:57,716
- I'm not ready to be a father.
- And what does Melinda say?

758
00:52:57,922 --> 00:53:00,618
We don't ever talk about it,
what is there to say?

759
00:53:00,825 --> 00:53:03,316
Isn't that what marriage is?
Knowing without saying?

760
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:05,257
That's fantasyland, Dan.

761
00:53:05,463 --> 00:53:09,422
All relationships are killed
by dishonesty...

762
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:13,229
repressed feelings,
things left unsaid.

763
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:15,201
Honesty first.

764
00:53:15,406 --> 00:53:17,738
No protection, no erection.
You are good.

765
00:53:17,942 --> 00:53:20,467
I'm the best.

766
00:53:21,412 --> 00:53:24,313
No protection, no erection.

767
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:27,407
Back on the record, please.

768
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:31,279
I'm trying to picture this.
You were kneeling?

769
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:34,890
No, I was standing
up bend over...

770
00:53:35,093 --> 00:53:37,891
with him in my mouth.

771
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:43,025
So, he was a
passive participant.

772
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:47,136
No, his hand was
under my skirt...

773
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:52,605
and he started
to touch me, rub my...

774
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:55,942
''Mrs. Happy''?

775
00:53:56,948 --> 00:53:59,212
Yes, and let's see...

776
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:04,047
with his other hand he was
still touching my breast...

777
00:54:04,322 --> 00:54:05,619
very gently...

778
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,884
slowly tracing tiny circles
around my nipple.

779
00:54:10,695 --> 00:54:13,255
Around and around.

780
00:54:13,998 --> 00:54:16,262
Around and around.

781
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:19,866
And up and down
on ''Mrs. Happy''.

782
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:22,266
Up and down.

783
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:25,067
And around, and around.

784
00:54:31,082 --> 00:54:33,414
Off the record a second.
Counsel, excuse me.

785
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:36,416
Would you object
to attend a recess?

786
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,384
Quite the contrary, counsel.

787
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:58,231
I'm just trying
to tell the truth.

788
00:54:58,443 --> 00:55:02,504
It sounds like you've had
wonderful sex with a terrific lover.

789
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:07,116
We're trying to sue him, remember?
We're not writing an erotic novel.

790
00:55:08,586 --> 00:55:11,521
Circles, though, sound great.

791
00:55:17,228 --> 00:55:20,391
How did you come up
with that circle business?

792
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,727
- Circle business?
- Around the nipple.

793
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:27,829
Around and around...

794
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:31,270
up and down.

795
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:38,481
Around and around,
and up and down.

796
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,268
Excuse me.

797
00:56:01,472 --> 00:56:03,497
Nice camera work.

798
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:07,303
- Here.
- I thought they kicked you out.

799
00:56:07,745 --> 00:56:11,408
- Lawrence Carmichael.
- Esquire. Attorney.

800
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:14,574
- You're a lawyer?
- ABD.

801
00:56:14,919 --> 00:56:17,615
How would you kids
like to earn...

802
00:56:17,822 --> 00:56:19,881
a little extra
scratch on the side?

803
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:21,480
Scratch?

804
00:56:34,939 --> 00:56:37,931
Time sort of stood still.

805
00:56:38,142 --> 00:56:44,081
I remember becoming aware of
pounding and people's voices.

806
00:56:44,615 --> 00:56:46,606
Then, the phone
started to ring.

807
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:49,709
That's when he...

808
00:56:50,688 --> 00:56:52,485
put his...

809
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,180
''Mr. Majestic''.

810
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:56,822
into my...

811
00:56:57,028 --> 00:56:58,495
''Mrs. Happy''.

812
00:56:58,696 --> 00:57:01,995
...and there was this pounding
and shouting...

813
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,997
and ringing and we got
into this amazing rhythm...

814
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:07,466
and it was all over
in about a minute.

815
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:10,266
Minute and a half.

816
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:14,606
- Did Klink arrive at a mission?
- Yes.

817
00:57:14,812 --> 00:57:16,780
I wasn't using
any protection...

818
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:20,610
so at the last minute we pulled apart
and I finished him with my hand.

819
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:23,549
- You did?
- Yes. And the other time too.

820
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:26,146
Really?

821
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:30,820
Off the record,
for a second.

822
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:34,959
Is it hot in here, counsel?

823
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:38,294
It's almost eleven.
I'd like to break early for lunch.

824
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:40,461
This is the first day.

825
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:43,469
Given the exhaustive nature
of today's testimony...

826
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:48,570
...perhaps a discontinuation...
- Is counsel requesting a recess?

827
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:51,509
What would counsel's inclination
be to that request?

828
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:54,409
Request granted.

829
00:58:20,778 --> 00:58:23,645
Does counsel have
plans for lunch?

830
00:58:23,948 --> 00:58:27,315
Counsel's going back to the
hotel for a cold shower.

831
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:32,321
Howdy, Ezri.

832
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:34,522
- Howdy, partner.
- How are you?

833
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:01,607
You've got a great
memory for details.

834
00:59:05,222 --> 00:59:09,852
It's like being there,
everything comes floating out.

835
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:16,896
Melinda,
why are you suing me?

836
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:20,559
This is so humiliating for both
of us and if it goes to trial...

837
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:24,867
everyone in Boise will
find out about it.

838
00:59:25,443 --> 00:59:28,105
I think I'm gonna drop the sue,
I don't wanna go any further with it.

839
00:59:28,312 --> 00:59:31,611
What? Really? No.

840
00:59:31,816 --> 00:59:35,411
You should get...
something.

841
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:39,981
Do you love me, Dr. Klink?

842
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:45,657
Do I love you?

843
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:47,854
Yes, do you love me?

844
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:53,366
I could love you.

845
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:55,562
Good.

846
00:59:57,408 --> 01:00:00,935
- Thanks, Ezri,
- Get that looked at.

847
01:00:02,246 --> 01:00:04,840
What is it with
you and elevators?

848
01:00:05,049 --> 01:00:08,507
- Take the goddamned stairs.
- I wanted to talk to you.

849
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:11,654
Maybe... I was thinking...

850
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:15,384
I really want to
settle out of court.

851
01:00:18,896 --> 01:00:20,989
Let me set you straight.

852
01:00:21,198 --> 01:00:24,964
First: Ezri Stovall
has never settled.

853
01:00:25,169 --> 01:00:28,002
- But...
- He either wins...

854
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,802
or goes down
kicking and biting.

855
01:00:32,009 --> 01:00:34,273
Two, two.

856
01:00:34,478 --> 01:00:37,538
Ezri Stovall makes the recommendation
to the insurance...

857
01:00:37,748 --> 01:00:40,876
company to go to court,
to settle, etceteras.

858
01:00:41,085 --> 01:00:43,781
If you don't hear
his advice...

859
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:46,616
you'll be settling on your own
without the insurance company.

860
01:00:50,227 --> 01:00:52,218
I have malpractice insurance.

861
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,564
Fine print, elevator boy...

862
01:00:58,769 --> 01:01:02,227
your policy guarantees
you a defense...

863
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:05,499
it doesn't say it'll
pay out if you lose...

864
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:10,942
or if it finds that you
have acted criminally.

865
01:01:11,148 --> 01:01:13,878
- Criminally?
- Or either unethically.

866
01:01:14,084 --> 01:01:18,646
- She wasn't even my patient.
- Or, if you decide to, and I quote...

867
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:23,657
''lf you decide to act against
insurance appointed counsel''.

868
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:28,490
You mean if I settle I pay?

869
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:29,893
Yep.

870
01:01:30,835 --> 01:01:32,962
Hey, Mel.

871
01:01:34,972 --> 01:01:37,600
I got you some Arby's.

872
01:01:38,909 --> 01:01:41,036
Thanks.

873
01:01:53,958 --> 01:01:56,119
I've been thinking, Mel,
I know what our problem was.

874
01:01:56,327 --> 01:01:58,158
Me too. You cheated
with that waitress.

875
01:01:58,362 --> 01:02:00,728
I didn't.
I was gonna, but I didn't.

876
01:02:00,931 --> 01:02:02,330
You lied to me about
sleeping with her?

877
01:02:02,533 --> 01:02:03,864
- You and I weren't...
- You couldn't...

878
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:07,799
I couldn't because you wanted a baby.
Dr. Paige spelled it out for me.

879
01:02:08,005 --> 01:02:11,099
No protection, no erection.
I wasn't ready yet.

880
01:02:11,308 --> 01:02:13,640
But if you want a baby,
we'll have one.

881
01:02:13,844 --> 01:02:15,505
Especially with the money
we're getting.

882
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:17,340
I don't want to make
a baby. Not yet.

883
01:02:17,581 --> 01:02:18,775
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

884
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:21,213
Dr. Paige said
it was classic...

885
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:22,715
the way you lost
your diaphragm.

886
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,720
She's wrong. I didn't use it,
because you wanted me pregnant.

887
01:02:26,924 --> 01:02:29,449
I wanted you pregnant?
No, you...

888
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,922
Wait, you wanted
to get pregnant.

889
01:02:31,128 --> 01:02:33,426
No way, I'm not ready
to have a baby.

890
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:36,293
You're not? That means
we're both not ready.

891
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,229
Do you understand?
This is awesome.

892
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:42,098
I thought that if I mentioned
it, you'd divorce me.

893
01:02:42,306 --> 01:02:43,739
Really?
Me, too.

894
01:02:43,941 --> 01:02:46,136
My God. Honesty first.

895
01:02:46,343 --> 01:02:50,336
I feel like a wimp.
Dr. Paige is a genius.

896
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:53,015
- I love you, Mel.
- I love you, Danny.

897
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:56,448
I've missed you holding me,
my hand and touching my back.

898
01:02:57,121 --> 01:03:00,113
- This is what I wanted.
- Me, too.

899
01:03:00,324 --> 01:03:04,624
We could do this everyday,
all day, whenever we want.

900
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,853
With that money, we could
do whatever we want.

901
01:03:07,064 --> 01:03:09,328
You should the things
Larry has lined up.

902
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:13,025
The telemarketing,
the opportunities...

903
01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:15,228
real-state,
there's fun stuff, too.

904
01:03:15,439 --> 01:03:18,306
- Jai-Alay, boxing.
- What's Larry have to do?

905
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:20,500
He works for us.
He quit his job.

906
01:03:20,711 --> 01:03:22,702
- Larry's never had a job.
- He has one now...

907
01:03:22,913 --> 01:03:25,814
he works for us.
He's gonna get 10% .

908
01:03:26,183 --> 01:03:28,481
This isn't a jackpot, Dan.
This is our life.

909
01:03:28,686 --> 01:03:30,483
I was stupid before.

910
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:33,885
Say whatever you have to say.
I don't even care.

911
01:03:34,091 --> 01:03:35,456
Where are you going?

912
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:38,150
I want out.
I want all to go away...

913
01:03:38,362 --> 01:03:41,889
...the doctors, the lawyers and you.
- Me? What did I do?

914
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,496
I don't like you, Danny,
you're a big bad devil.

915
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:47,928
What?
What did I do?

916
01:03:57,514 --> 01:04:01,245
- You wanna drop the lawsuit?
- Yes, it's not worth it.

917
01:04:02,419 --> 01:04:06,355
- I never liked this to begin with.
- This one looked better on paper.

918
01:04:13,397 --> 01:04:17,333
Fine. Fine, just write us a
check for all of our legal fees.

919
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:20,296
Fine, how much
would that be?

920
01:04:20,504 --> 01:04:23,701
Let's see. We have
Miss Barker's fees.

921
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:26,967
Plus expenses
times ten days.

922
01:04:27,177 --> 01:04:29,372
Plus first class air fare.

923
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,548
And her support staff
in Chicago.

924
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:34,411
There's me and my
staff here in Boise.

925
01:04:34,618 --> 01:04:37,610
Plus one private detective
at 50 dollars an hour.

926
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:43,157
Plus Xeroxing, postage,
various office expenses...

927
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,954
comes just under US$75 thousand.

928
01:04:46,163 --> 01:04:49,530
- US$ 75 thousand?
- Just under.

929
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:50,859
I don't have
that kind of money.

930
01:04:53,737 --> 01:04:56,706
I guess we'll stay
in the course.

931
01:04:57,441 --> 01:05:01,775
Never forget you're
the victim here.

932
01:05:15,426 --> 01:05:17,018
Tiff...?

933
01:05:17,461 --> 01:05:19,292
Who are you?
Where's Tiffany?

934
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,861
Helen Dallwore
Private Investigator.

935
01:05:22,066 --> 01:05:24,933
Your receptionist let me in.

936
01:05:26,303 --> 01:05:27,895
I don't know
who you work for...

937
01:05:28,105 --> 01:05:31,040
I work for you, asshole.
Ezri Stovall hired me.

938
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:33,175
- Is Dr. Rice in this picture?
- Come again?

939
01:05:33,944 --> 01:05:36,071
That's what she said.

940
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,771
Ezri said you banged
some shrink at a conference.

941
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:41,280
Dr. Rice. Are you still
in contact with her?

942
01:05:41,952 --> 01:05:45,444
No, Dr. Rice
is no longer in the picture.

943
01:05:46,924 --> 01:05:53,295
Could you please not touch
mine or Tiffany's things?

944
01:05:54,031 --> 01:05:56,090
Did Mrs. Carmichael
mention any other affairs?

945
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,430
Other doctors she screwed:
dentists, podiatrists, clergy?

946
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:03,834
Clergy? No. I told
Mr. Stovall everything...

947
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:08,034
and anything she
told me is confidential.

948
01:06:08,245 --> 01:06:12,614
Right, don't wanna abuse that
doctor-patient relationship.

949
01:06:12,816 --> 01:06:18,311
I must insist that you leave.

950
01:06:18,522 --> 01:06:22,424
Don't get lippy with me,
Doc, I didn't screw my patient.

951
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:25,220
She'll...

952
01:06:25,896 --> 01:06:30,196
In an elevator?
Are you kidding me?

953
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,961
We aren't talking
about Roger, right?

954
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:36,696
Good all ''Mr. By the Book''.

955
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:39,205
When I met him, he was
a 23 year old virgin...

956
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:45,310
and the morning after we
had sex for the first time...

957
01:06:45,516 --> 01:06:48,246
I got a call out of the blue from an
ex-boyfriend who proposes to me.

958
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:51,754
- Well?
- Roger, in a fit of jealousy...

959
01:06:51,955 --> 01:06:54,947
jumps up and says:
''I will marry you''.

960
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:59,220
Years later, I found out
what he meant: ''Could''.

961
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:00,418
Not want.

962
01:07:00,631 --> 01:07:04,089
So, you got married
on a grammatical error?

963
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:06,792
All I know is...

964
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:09,532
we were never very happy.

965
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,931
Has he had many
affairs, your husband?

966
01:07:12,142 --> 01:07:17,637
Well, there was that OTOPI conference
in Denver a couple of years ago.

967
01:07:17,848 --> 01:07:21,511
OTOPI?
That's analogous, right?

968
01:07:21,785 --> 01:07:24,253
- What?
- OTOPI.

969
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:27,981
The Organization of Therapists
Analysts, bla-bla-bla.

970
01:07:28,192 --> 01:07:29,887
- Right.
- I shouldn't be telling you this.

971
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:33,392
- I've had too many of these.
- Darling...

972
01:07:33,997 --> 01:07:36,329
you can tell me anything.

973
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:42,528
Well, he comes back from
Denver and he's a changed man.

974
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:46,971
All of a sudden he
is ''Mr. Oral Sex''.

975
01:07:47,544 --> 01:07:51,446
Up until then Roger
had very rarely...

976
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:53,616
''cunnilingued'' me.

977
01:07:53,817 --> 01:07:55,910
You say: ''cunnilingued''?

978
01:07:56,119 --> 01:08:00,818
Well, I don't know what's
the verb for cunnilingus.

979
01:08:01,024 --> 01:08:02,753
- ''Cunnilingueated''?
- Stop it.

980
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,123
''Cunnilingual''?
That verb?

981
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:09,026
I don't know, but I like it.

982
01:08:09,866 --> 01:08:13,529
He comes back from Denver
and suddenly he's an expert.

983
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:17,332
Oh, yes. He's slow,
he's sensual...

984
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:20,772
he's circular...

985
01:08:21,678 --> 01:08:23,703
Am I boring you?

986
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:27,210
Not a bit.

987
01:08:29,486 --> 01:08:30,817
Salty.

988
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:34,819
And he started doing this
circle thing, you know...

989
01:08:35,025 --> 01:08:38,119
with his hands
on my breast.

990
01:08:38,328 --> 01:08:42,128
- Like that.
- Really?

991
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:44,263
I let...

992
01:08:44,835 --> 01:08:47,565
the whole thing drop.
And then...

993
01:08:47,771 --> 01:08:52,401
five or six months later he got a
card in the mail from a Dr. Rice.

994
01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:55,271
- Looked like an invitation.
- Who is Dr. Rice?

995
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:58,710
Exactly what I said.
You know, very nicely.

996
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:00,610
And Roger got very flustered.

997
01:09:00,817 --> 01:09:04,947
And said something about been
addressed to the wrong Dr. Klink.

998
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,164
Dr. Rice is a boy
doctor or a girl doctor?

999
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:19,496
A girl doctor.

1000
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:23,169
Are you sure?

1001
01:09:23,373 --> 01:09:28,072
Who else but a girl could've
taught him all those things?

1002
01:09:28,879 --> 01:09:32,280
Thank you for your help.

1003
01:09:33,684 --> 01:09:37,677
We are separated,
you know?

1004
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:43,882
- Do you live alone?
- I have a room mate.

1005
01:09:44,094 --> 01:09:47,325
But listen, here's my card...

1006
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:52,264
and if you think of anything else,
why don't you call me?

1007
01:09:52,469 --> 01:09:53,902
- Day or night.
- Thank you.

1008
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:56,095
Ma'am.

1009
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:01,577
I'll see you.

1010
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,097
What's going on?

1011
01:10:25,302 --> 01:10:28,499
- Good morning, counsel.
- Hi, counsel. How's it hanging?

1012
01:10:30,607 --> 01:10:33,667
You better put that animal in a cage or
I'll have to get a restraining order.

1013
01:10:33,877 --> 01:10:38,211
Your client is violating
rules regarding behavior.

1014
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,641
I'll squeeze in with you.

1015
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,052
Let's take the stairs.

1016
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:50,821
I get an erection just
thinking about elevators.

1017
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:55,397
We were by the door, standing
up, he was hugging me...

1018
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:58,898
moving his hands over my dress
and then under my dress.

1019
01:10:59,102 --> 01:11:01,229
I wasn't wearing any underwear.

1020
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:03,630
Baby!

1021
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:10,209
Hey, Dan, over here.

1022
01:11:10,714 --> 01:11:13,478
- Larry. You've seen Melinda?
- Haven't seen her, bro.

1023
01:11:13,683 --> 01:11:15,742
You think this money is going
to her head, do you?

1024
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:18,887
I don't think so. In fact, I don't think
she's a 100% into the whole thing.

1025
01:11:19,089 --> 01:11:22,058
We were talking last...
This is...?

1026
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:24,683
Larry, this is Melinda naked.

1027
01:11:24,895 --> 01:11:26,863
I took her head off last year's
Christmas card...

1028
01:11:27,063 --> 01:11:30,829
downloaded the body off the net,
the rest is the magic of PhotoShop.

1029
01:11:31,034 --> 01:11:34,401
- But, goddamn, Larry, she's still naked.
- It's not her body.

1030
01:11:34,604 --> 01:11:38,267
With sexy artwork on the video
box I can get double per unit.

1031
01:11:38,475 --> 01:11:40,136
What are you talking about?

1032
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:42,975
I put my hands in his pants...

1033
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:46,647
- Oh, my God, Larry.
- That's my little surprise.

1034
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:49,250
- Melinda is hot, bro.
- Are those...?

1035
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:51,444
Would you look at this crowd?

1036
01:11:51,655 --> 01:11:54,215
We can sell deposition
tapes to every bar in town.

1037
01:11:54,424 --> 01:11:57,222
I've got a buddy working
on the web site.

1038
01:11:57,427 --> 01:12:00,396
Larry, I'm trying to get
back with her.

1039
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:11,100
- Have you seen your brother?
- Speaking of the devil... Hey, Melinda!

1040
01:12:12,209 --> 01:12:15,007
- What's this?
- Don't worry. It's not your body.

1041
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:17,546
Turn it off,
I think the game is on.

1042
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,115
With his other hand he was very...

1043
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:23,980
That's me on TV.

1044
01:12:24,187 --> 01:12:26,655
...around and around
and around.

1045
01:12:26,857 --> 01:12:29,223
And up and down on...

1046
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,388
''Mrs. Happy''!

1047
01:12:31,595 --> 01:12:34,587
Turn it off! Turn it off!

1048
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:37,528
Danny?

1049
01:12:37,734 --> 01:12:38,826
Oh, Mel.

1050
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:40,195
- Oh, shit.
- How could you?

1051
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:42,462
- I didn't, I swear.
- How could you?

1052
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:44,663
I didn't, Mel, I swear.

1053
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:47,105
I swear to God I didn't, Mel.

1054
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:51,105
That's my wife!
Could we please turn it off?

1055
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:53,908
Hey, everybody,
it's ''Mr. Happy''!

1056
01:12:56,586 --> 01:12:58,178
Hey, Buddy.

1057
01:13:00,156 --> 01:13:02,317
Get down!

1058
01:13:02,526 --> 01:13:03,515
Let me go!

1059
01:13:23,146 --> 01:13:27,480
You're kidding.
That's not so bad. When?

1060
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:32,745
Good idea.
Time is the essence.

1061
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:35,352
Get hold of Dr. Paige
in the morning.

1062
01:13:35,559 --> 01:13:38,926
No, I'll convey the message
to Mr. Stovall.

1063
01:13:43,934 --> 01:13:46,425
- What's up?
- Good news for our team.

1064
01:13:46,636 --> 01:13:49,002
The Carmichaels
are splitting up for good.

1065
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:52,868
Melinda's at some motel by the
highway... She is very upset.

1066
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:56,311
I'd like to give her
a day's rest.

1067
01:13:57,113 --> 01:14:00,480
Johnson thinks we should
move on to Paige's deposition.

1068
01:14:01,885 --> 01:14:04,376
I'm not sure I'm prepared
for Dr. Paige.

1069
01:14:04,754 --> 01:14:08,918
Ezri, it would mean
an awful lot to me.

1070
01:14:22,973 --> 01:14:26,773
Max, do you ever think about the other
rube? The one you didn't want?

1071
01:14:28,345 --> 01:14:30,836
The one you stood up?

1072
01:14:31,047 --> 01:14:35,484
You were afraid to walk down, afraid
to let down your hair and run.

1073
01:14:39,489 --> 01:14:43,289
I'm not looking for
an answer just a little...

1074
01:14:43,493 --> 01:14:46,018
anonymous companionship.

1075
01:14:48,164 --> 01:14:51,099
Here, Doc, compliments of the
ladies at the end of the bar.

1076
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:57,432
It's the Corvette, Max,
the women love it.

1077
01:14:58,074 --> 01:14:59,871
To ''Dr. Majestic''.

1078
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:02,738
- ''Dr. Majestic''.
- Who told you that?

1079
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:06,140
That's confidential.

1080
01:15:06,349 --> 01:15:08,715
Doc... Attorney...

1081
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:14,882
Doc, you forgot
your picture.

1082
01:15:47,223 --> 01:15:50,624
- Is Felix in?
- He's in the shower.

1083
01:15:52,362 --> 01:15:56,958
Oh, you are the room mate.
He said he had a room mate.

1084
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:59,829
- Did he? And you must be?
- I'm Jennifer.

1085
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:05,472
- I'm the almost ex Mrs. Dr. Klink.
- Right.

1086
01:16:05,675 --> 01:16:08,508
- And you're here because...?
- Well...

1087
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:13,273
I have a very valuable piece
of evidence to help screw...

1088
01:16:13,483 --> 01:16:16,577
my future ex-husband. And...

1089
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:20,512
I'd really like
to give it to Felix.

1090
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:23,284
We're not just room mates,
we're partners.

1091
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:27,724
Okay, so what happened is
I got a call from Max...

1092
01:16:27,931 --> 01:16:30,331
the bartender down
at the lounge.

1093
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:34,094
He didn't know Roger and I split,
so he called the house, and...

1094
01:16:35,138 --> 01:16:39,768
Iook what my husband
left behind in the bar.

1095
01:16:40,577 --> 01:16:43,740
I've seen this picture before.
What's the big deal?

1096
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:47,815
That's Dr. Rice next to
my husband... Ex-husband!

1097
01:16:49,052 --> 01:16:53,284
- Look at their hands.
- That's Dr. Rice?

1098
01:16:56,059 --> 01:16:59,688
''To a great orator,
love, E.R.''.

1099
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:02,425
Dr. Rice taught Roger...

1100
01:17:02,632 --> 01:17:07,035
the ''cunnilingual'' arts,
as Felix put it.

1101
01:17:07,437 --> 01:17:09,928
Is that how he put it?

1102
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:25,387
Does Felix take
long showers?

1103
01:17:25,955 --> 01:17:29,254
We are lovers,
not just partners.

1104
01:17:29,626 --> 01:17:32,595
Yes, okay.
Well, I never would have...

1105
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,225
Look at me.

1106
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:37,524
A lot of fringe. Well...

1107
01:17:37,734 --> 01:17:40,430
He called you his room mate,
just so you know that.

1108
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,664
- Sorry.
- That's okay, that's okay.

1109
01:17:43,873 --> 01:17:48,139
This is an Idaho Chardonnay
if you wanna...

1110
01:17:48,545 --> 01:17:51,412
I'm gonna go,
keep the photo.

1111
01:17:51,614 --> 01:17:53,707
Keep this.

1112
01:17:54,384 --> 01:17:55,908
And...

1113
01:17:56,586 --> 01:18:00,113
...bust his balls for me, would you?
- Don't worry.

1114
01:18:32,889 --> 01:18:34,948
- This better be good.
- I've found a picture of Klink...

1115
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:38,321
...with Dr. Rice.
- Meaningless. Good-bye.

1116
01:18:38,528 --> 01:18:40,257
Guess who Dr. Rice is.

1117
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:43,922
Really?

1118
01:18:46,302 --> 01:18:48,463
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1119
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:53,173
I'll call you back.

1120
01:19:09,092 --> 01:19:12,255
Consuelo, that was amazing.

1121
01:19:12,962 --> 01:19:15,829
That was a classy misdemeanor.

1122
01:19:16,032 --> 01:19:19,593
My dear, that was a felony.

1123
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:23,298
You know what I hate? I hate
that one of us has to lose.

1124
01:19:23,506 --> 01:19:25,633
I wish we could both win.

1125
01:19:39,589 --> 01:19:43,548
Exhibit A is a group photograph
from the OTOPI shrink convention...

1126
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,285
Denver 1999.

1127
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:50,463
Do you recognize the woman
standing next to Roger Klink?

1128
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:53,968
Of course I do.

1129
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,037
Would you please read what's written
on the back on the photo?

1130
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:03,374
''To a great orator,
love, E.R.''.

1131
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,212
- Who is E.R.?
- Emily Rice.

1132
01:20:08,551 --> 01:20:13,784
- Who is Emily Rice?
- Me. I am... I was.

1133
01:20:14,757 --> 01:20:18,352
My second former husband
was Eugene Rice.

1134
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:21,721
What did you mean
''a great orator''?

1135
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:25,628
It's double on tongue.
No big deal.

1136
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:28,166
It refers to oral sex.

1137
01:20:28,671 --> 01:20:30,434
We had a fling in Denver.

1138
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:34,235
We hardly left the room for 3 days
although it was more of a workshop...

1139
01:20:34,444 --> 01:20:36,173
considering Roger
was a sexual flaggingly.

1140
01:20:36,379 --> 01:20:37,368
I object.

1141
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,482
It's the truth. I tutored him
in various sexual techniques...

1142
01:20:41,684 --> 01:20:43,481
granted, he was
a quick learner...

1143
01:20:43,686 --> 01:20:46,553
he made the greatest thrives
in the oral disciplines.

1144
01:20:46,756 --> 01:20:50,522
- Hence, a great ''orator''.
- Oral? You and Dr. Klink?

1145
01:20:50,827 --> 01:20:53,261
I named his penis
''Mr. Majestic''.

1146
01:20:53,463 --> 01:20:55,158
- To boost his confidence.
- Jesus.

1147
01:20:55,365 --> 01:20:56,354
- Oh, God.
- Oh, man.

1148
01:20:56,799 --> 01:20:59,267
- Should I go off record?
- Don't you dare.

1149
01:20:59,469 --> 01:21:02,905
I showed him everything. I crammed
6 months of training into 3 days.

1150
01:21:03,106 --> 01:21:05,574
And we had an
elevator in Denver.

1151
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:07,899
- You two had sex in an elevator?
- Well...

1152
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:11,512
Well, he was too timid. ''What if
someone comes? I'm so scared''.

1153
01:21:11,714 --> 01:21:14,945
You were like a
super-charged sex instructor.

1154
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:19,485
''Roll over, rub here, touch this,
on your back, on your knees.''

1155
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,357
- It was like a sexual boot camp.
- You loved it.

1156
01:21:23,559 --> 01:21:26,892
And then you have the nerve to share
my advance circle technique...

1157
01:21:27,096 --> 01:21:30,395
with her. Those circles are
mine, I gave him that technique.

1158
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,696
But that's all it is to you: technique.
And disciplines, maneuvers.

1159
01:21:34,904 --> 01:21:39,671
I mean, if you'd shut up once during
the weekend and let me be me...

1160
01:21:39,876 --> 01:21:41,810
I might never gone back
to my wife.

1161
01:21:42,011 --> 01:21:44,605
- You should've told me, Dr. Paige.
- It had no bearing.

1162
01:21:44,814 --> 01:21:48,045
You pressed me to sue him.
You wanted to nail the bastard.

1163
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:49,616
You used me to
get back at...

1164
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:51,810
...Dr. Klink.
- How could you?

1165
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:53,955
You, you stole those
circles from Dr. Paige.

1166
01:21:54,157 --> 01:21:56,421
Hell hath no fury like
a woman scormed.

1167
01:21:56,626 --> 01:22:00,790
- No, no, I was trying to help.
- You used Mrs. Carmichael.

1168
01:22:01,397 --> 01:22:02,864
- A broken woman.
- Who was unable...

1169
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:06,627
to defend herself from the advances
of this sexual predator.

1170
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:09,995
Predator? He's a leaf eater,
a sexual herbivore.

1171
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:13,733
- I object.
- A predator created by Dr. Paige.

1172
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:18,608
- But then her creation spurned her.
- So you set out to destroy him...

1173
01:22:18,815 --> 01:22:21,648
and this innocent woman
just got in your way.

1174
01:22:21,851 --> 01:22:24,684
- None of this is true.
- You've ruined my life, Dr. Paige.

1175
01:22:24,887 --> 01:22:28,789
My marriage is over. Dan's become a
greedy asshole and his shit brother...

1176
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:30,856
is selling my deposition
to local bars.

1177
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:32,288
What?

1178
01:22:34,797 --> 01:22:36,697
- I did it.
- Well, you're fired.

1179
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:39,629
You can't fire her,
she's pregnant.

1180
01:22:41,771 --> 01:22:43,204
The tapes are
meaningless now.

1181
01:22:43,406 --> 01:22:45,806
Remember your wish
last night, Consuelo?

1182
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,067
- Last night?
- That both of us could win this case.

1183
01:22:49,512 --> 01:22:52,504
That is impossible, but I've come
up with the next best thing.

1184
01:22:53,082 --> 01:22:55,175
First: you drop
your sue against Klink.

1185
01:22:55,384 --> 01:22:56,942
- Do what?
- Drop the sue? Never.

1186
01:22:57,153 --> 01:23:00,714
We'll file a sue on behalf
of Carmichael and Klink...

1187
01:23:00,923 --> 01:23:02,914
the real victims in this case...

1188
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:06,155
against the real villain...

1189
01:23:06,496 --> 01:23:10,227
the knaving and
vengeful Dr. Paige.

1190
01:23:10,433 --> 01:23:12,731
- This will never hold up in court.
- It won't have to.

1191
01:23:12,935 --> 01:23:14,960
You'll settle out of court
for US$5 million...

1192
01:23:15,171 --> 01:23:16,536
which the company
will agree to.

1193
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:20,065
Melinda and Klink
will split five million.

1194
01:23:20,276 --> 01:23:22,141
- Minus 30% .
- Everyone's a winner.

1195
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:24,436
Well, not everyone...

1196
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:27,343
According to the settlement,
Dr. Paige will lose her license.

1197
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,916
- Lose my license?
- But...

1198
01:23:30,453 --> 01:23:32,978
there's an island in the Caribbean
where you don't need a license...

1199
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:35,783
to practice the
psychiatric arts.

1200
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:39,854
- Grand Cayman.
- The Caribbean?

1201
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:43,924
- Brilliant. It's a happy ending.
- You're the greatest.

1202
01:23:50,106 --> 01:23:51,937
Give me a hug.

1203
01:23:52,141 --> 01:23:54,234
Melinda, Roger...

1204
01:23:54,744 --> 01:23:56,177
congratulations!

1205
01:23:56,379 --> 01:24:00,247
- We won, we are rich!
- This is insane. I won't agree.

1206
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,883
I want to speak
to my attorney.

1207
01:24:06,656 --> 01:24:08,851
I am your attorney.

1208
01:24:10,293 --> 01:24:13,820
Every shrink in Idaho has
the same malpractice plan...

1209
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:17,124
and the same lawyer:
Ezri Stovall.

1210
01:24:17,733 --> 01:24:21,362
As your attorney, and the one voice
the insurance company listens to...

1211
01:24:21,571 --> 01:24:24,131
I recommend we settle
out of court.

1212
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,434
But you never
settle out of court.

1213
01:24:31,447 --> 01:24:34,678
I will. For you.

1214
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:40,383
Love means making
sacrifices.

1215
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:47,322
Sorry, Emily, would you
like some champagne?

1216
01:24:48,231 --> 01:24:49,323
Melinda?

1217
01:24:49,532 --> 01:24:52,695
Goddamned lawyers
and doctors, go to hell!

1218
01:24:55,304 --> 01:24:56,293
Melinda?

1219
01:24:58,107 --> 01:25:00,098
Melinda, wait!

1220
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:06,009
Roger.

1221
01:25:09,252 --> 01:25:12,585
- When did you come up with this?
- After you fell asleep.

1222
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:15,180
I fell asleep?

1223
01:25:15,391 --> 01:25:18,417
- So we didn't...?
- No.

1224
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:20,919
I missed it.

1225
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:24,258
I took the liberty of reschedule
on you for 3 o'clock.

1226
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:26,298
It's time!

1227
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:29,197
Time?

1228
01:25:29,939 --> 01:25:31,566
The baby.

1229
01:25:54,797 --> 01:25:57,027
Melinda! Our bottle!

1230
01:26:00,303 --> 01:26:02,362
Roger, Roger, get back here!

1231
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,254
Pull over, we need to talk!

1232
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:29,929
Roger! Roger!

1233
01:26:31,067 --> 01:26:33,035
Careful, Emily.

1234
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,263
Roger, Roger, hold on!

1235
01:26:45,414 --> 01:26:47,211
Come on! Come on!

1236
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:16,202
Go away!

1237
01:27:16,412 --> 01:27:17,811
Okay. Alright.

1238
01:27:18,147 --> 01:27:21,412
Listen, I must've been crazy
to risk losing you, okay?

1239
01:27:21,617 --> 01:27:24,245
Screw the money, screw the lawyers,
screw Larry, screw the shrinks.

1240
01:27:24,453 --> 01:27:26,819
I just want you,
I'm begging you.

1241
01:27:27,022 --> 01:27:28,922
Please, I'm begging you.

1242
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:31,525
I need you. We are a team,
remember? Sigfrid and Roy...

1243
01:27:31,727 --> 01:27:34,423
...ham and cheese.
- You don't care about the money?

1244
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:38,157
I don't need money to be happy,
Mel. I just need you. That's it.

1245
01:27:40,803 --> 01:27:43,601
I missed you so much.

1246
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:46,065
Kiss me.

1247
01:27:49,512 --> 01:27:53,676
I lied to you. I didn't throw
my diaphragm away, or lose it.

1248
01:27:53,883 --> 01:27:56,545
- You didn't.
- It's here, in my purse.

1249
01:27:56,752 --> 01:28:00,916
- Do you got any of that sauce?
- Spermicidal gel?

1250
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:04,288
- Say it again.
- Spermicidal gel.

1251
01:28:06,595 --> 01:28:09,462
- Go get it now, we're in business.
- ''Mr. Happy''!

1252
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:11,591
- Let's not call it that anymore.
- What should we call him?

1253
01:28:11,801 --> 01:28:16,135
- I'll think of something.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

1254
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:22,406
Oh, my God.

1255
01:28:26,382 --> 01:28:28,646
Oh, God.

1256
01:28:29,452 --> 01:28:31,613
Oh, I love birth control.

1257
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:33,982
- Why are you laughing?
- We are rich.

1258
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:40,857
There was a settlement and
we get almost US$2 million.

1259
01:28:41,263 --> 01:28:43,060
We are rich?

1260
01:28:43,299 --> 01:28:45,392
We can afford one of
those track houses.

1261
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:03,380
Melinda? Are you alright?

1262
01:29:03,586 --> 01:29:06,282
God, Danny, it's him!

1263
01:29:06,889 --> 01:29:08,516
And that's how we got here.

1264
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:13,252
- Klink, Paige, Rice...
- I need a goddamn program.

1265
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:17,432
Turn that damn thing off.

1266
01:29:17,633 --> 01:29:20,727
I've had about enough. Go get a
position near the door, we're going in.

1267
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:25,336
- Thank you, lady.
- Hurry!

1268
01:29:25,808 --> 01:29:30,177
- Oh, God! I love you, Danny!
- I love you too, baby!

1269
01:29:30,546 --> 01:29:33,709
Wait, let me try
talking to them.

1270
01:29:35,384 --> 01:29:40,549
Dr. Paige! Dr. Klink!
Honesty first, right?

1271
01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:45,657
I mean, Dr. Paige what do
you want from Dr. Klink?

1272
01:29:45,861 --> 01:29:47,954
And vice versa.

1273
01:29:48,163 --> 01:29:50,427
Danny and me
took your advice.

1274
01:29:50,633 --> 01:29:54,865
We were finally honest
with each other. It worked.

1275
01:29:55,104 --> 01:29:59,097
Yeah, all relationships are killed by
dishonesty, repressed feelings...

1276
01:29:59,308 --> 01:30:02,607
things left unsaid, things like that.
Come on, honesty first.

1277
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:05,538
Emily, I wanted to be
with you so bad...

1278
01:30:05,748 --> 01:30:07,511
I was sick after
the OTOPI conference.

1279
01:30:09,718 --> 01:30:11,151
Roger, I want you.

1280
01:30:11,353 --> 01:30:14,379
I wanted to be close to you since
Denver. It's all I've ever wanted.

1281
01:30:14,924 --> 01:30:17,119
My wife and I got married because
of a grammatical misunderstanding.

1282
01:30:17,693 --> 01:30:21,094
She thought I proposed. I only meant:
''I could'' hypothetically marry her.

1283
01:30:21,297 --> 01:30:23,424
I only married Mr. Paige
to make you jealous.

1284
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:26,760
I fantasized that you'd burst
into the church and stop it.

1285
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:29,494
That was my fantasy.
I wanted to, but I was afraid.

1286
01:30:29,705 --> 01:30:32,765
Let's start over.
Honesty first. I was thinking...

1287
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:36,536
There's got to be a need for couples'
counseling on Grand Cayman, right?

1288
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:39,444
That's what I was thinking.

1289
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:41,809
I love you, Emily.

1290
01:30:42,685 --> 01:30:44,949
I love you, Roger.

1291
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:50,487
- Don't shoot me!
- Oh God, Danny!

1292
01:30:53,862 --> 01:30:54,590
What the...

1293
01:30:57,933 --> 01:30:59,924
Melinda, Melinda!

1294
01:31:00,235 --> 01:31:01,327
Melinda!

1295
01:31:01,537 --> 01:31:03,767
Go evasive! Go evasive!

1296
01:31:04,039 --> 01:31:05,973
- Were you shot?
- No, it's champagne.

1297
01:31:06,175 --> 01:31:09,542
Champagne?
Get in there, Trousdale.

1298
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:15,711
Shit.

1299
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:26,489
Careful, Trousdale.

1300
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:32,195
Well?

1301
01:31:34,903 --> 01:31:36,131
The circle.

1302
01:31:36,772 --> 01:31:41,334
The crisis will be resolved
in about 30 seconds, sir.

1303
01:31:45,314 --> 01:31:48,511
God damn. You two better
hold on tight this time.

1304
01:31:49,318 --> 01:31:52,287
There isn't anybody else in
the world that could love you.

1305
01:31:52,488 --> 01:31:54,718
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry.

1306
01:32:10,406 --> 01:32:13,170
Consuelo, we are just
getting started.

1307
01:32:18,514 --> 01:32:21,745
God, I love a happy ending.

1308
01:32:44,573 --> 01:32:47,599
Lucky Larry's lift,
come down and get lucky.
