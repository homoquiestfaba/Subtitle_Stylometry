1
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,210
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

2
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,646
See you tomorrow.

3
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,722
How you doing?

4
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,219
Okay.

5
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,499
- When did the mill close?
- Three years ago this August.

6
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,162
If you're looking for work,
you may want to try Aberdeen.

7
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,398
That's about the closest mill work
you'll find.

8
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,532
- Too bad.
- It's just simple economics.

9
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,543
You know, we have a really nice casino,
the Wild Cherry.

10
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,274
Want to make some money,
maybe you ought to go on down...

11
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,213
and try your luck at the blackjack tables.

12
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,308
No, I don't think so. Thanks.

13
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,176
You're Chris Vaughn?

14
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:46,254
Well, hell. I know all about you, Chris.

15
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,184
I know your folks. I'm Sheriff Stan Watkins.

16
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,628
- How you doing?
- Ralston, get out of the car!

17
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,462
You're looking at a real soldier here.
Pay some respects.

18
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,535
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,268
Well, hell, Chris.

20
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,072
- I'll give you a ride up to your folks'.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

21
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,574
- I insist.
- I'll walk.

22
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,905
- It's my pleasure.
- It's okay.

23
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,072
I won't take no for an answer. Get in the car.

24
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,575
- Did I scare you with that one?
- Little bit.

25
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,182
I scared him.

26
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,694
You were gone a while, huh?

27
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,824
Eight years. Harstad was sheriff back then.

28
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,135
Aaron Harstad, yeah.

29
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,996
Sad story.

30
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:37,766
About five months back,
he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree.

31
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,510
Car folded up like an accordion.

32
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,112
He was a good man.
A good man and a good sheriff.

33
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,998
All right.

34
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,307
- Thank you very much for the ride.
- Welcome home, Chris.

35
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,412
It's election month. I'm your man.

36
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,283
Okay. Say hey to your old man.

37
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,483
Let's go.

38
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,652
Can I help you?

39
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,226
Little brother.
You come over here and give me a hug.

40
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,968
- You look great.
- What is this?

41
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,436
I couldn't let you be
the only one looking good in uniform.

42
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,602
Hey, Ma. Chris is here.

43
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,173
- Whose tent?
- That's for Pete.

44
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,306
- Watch out, now.
- Chris.

45
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,543
- Look at you.
- Mom, how you doing?

46
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,751
How long's your leave?
How long do we have you?

47
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,520
For good. I'm home.

48
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,960
- Really? You're not kidding?
- No.

49
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,160
- Hey, Dad.
- Welcome back.

50
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,530
I wish you had told us exactly when
you were coming. I'd have cooked.

51
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,303
- This is fine, Mom.
- We love Chinese.

52
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,777
- No, this is great.
- So what are you going to do now?

53
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,282
I was planning to work at the mill,
but you never mentioned it closed.

54
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,978
We didn't want to bother you
when your father got laid off.

55
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,213
I got my business.
You saw the furniture outside.

56
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,382
And I substitute at the elementary school.
Michelle pitches in...

57
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,323
we try to keep things simple.

58
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,382
Pete.

59
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,989
- This is your Uncle Chris.
- Hey, Pete.

60
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,554
Sit down. Say hello.

61
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,658
Last time he saw you,
you were barely walking.

62
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,464
- And now I'm camping.
- I said you could sleep on the couch.

63
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,697
It was Chris' room first.

64
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,775
Your tent's going to take on water.
I can show you how to rig it.

65
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,343
Doesn't look like it's going to rain
to me, Colonel.

66
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,673
Sit down. Eat something.

67
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,214
First of all, I was a sergeant.
I worked for a living.

68
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,510
A grunt.

69
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,875
- Did you ever smoke anybody?
- Pete!

70
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,749
Poppa's still got your gun locked up
in the garage.

71
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,419
- Would you teach me how to shoot?
- I figured that'd be scrap metal by now.

72
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,862
No. I'm still hoping
you'll melt that thing down on your own.

73
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,390
- Sorry, Pete.
- Whatever.

74
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,230
- I'm out of here, Mom.
- Be back by 10:00.

75
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,769
- 10:30.
- 10:00.

76
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,463
Remind you of anyone?

77
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,820
Okay, it rained. Happy?

78
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,749
No.

79
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,458
Why don't you crash on the floor?

80
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,162
Okay. I'll crash on the floor.
You crash on the bed.

81
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,575
Keep you dry.

82
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,282
Did you really kill people?

83
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,356
- Ray-Ray.
- Hello, pudding.

84
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,785
- What's up, man?
- Good to see you, man.

85
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,794
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

86
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,488
What is that?

87
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,625
- That's the Love Machine.
- Girls actually get in there?

88
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,472
- How you been?
- Good.

89
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,475
- Clean living?
- Please. You want a beer?

90
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,774
No. Believe it or not, I quit drinking.
I'd take a soda, though.

91
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,245
Okay. Here.

92
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,775
Thanks, man.

93
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,216
Like that? When you left town...

94
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,153
it gave me the idea I should do something
with my life, too.

95
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:28,421
So I went down to Seattle, got a guitar,
and became all about music.

96
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,725
And then, pretty soon,
I was about music and drugs...

97
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,664
and pretty soon
I was basically just about drugs...

98
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,669
and ended up doing two years for B and E.

99
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,830
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,007
Look at me now, though, right?
I've been clean and sober 14 months.

101
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,242
Doing construction and renewing
those supportive and healthy friendships...

102
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,340
from my past.

103
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,750
Matter of fact, I talked to the bastards,
told them you were back...

104
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,687
and they asked me
to politely remind you that it is Saturday.

105
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,225
- As in...
- As in, kick-off's in 20 minutes.

106
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,156
- Like old times.
- You guys still doing it.

107
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,256
We're still doing it.

108
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,132
- Playing ball?
- Absolutely. Let's go, superstar!

109
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,469
- Just like the old days. Go deep.
- Come on.

110
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,077
When did that happen?

111
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,304
Jay Hamilton Field.

112
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,371
His parents hadn't left him the mill
for more than two minutes...

113
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,349
- before he shut it down.
- Why?

114
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,409
Heads up!

115
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,684
Because I opened my casino.

116
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,352
Still got a gun, huh, Jay?

117
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,253
Still got your reflexes.

118
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,121
What? Did you get tired
of being all that you could be?

119
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,255
- No. I'm still all I can be.
- Really?

120
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,731
- I'll just have to see about that.
- Yeah.

121
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,436
- What brings you home?
- I just want to relax. Catch my breath.

122
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,903
- You? Relax?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,536
Not today.

124
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,805
I got it.

125
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,078
Let's go. Come on!

126
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,026
Is that how it's going to be?

127
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,895
That's how it is.

128
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,932
- Full contact, huh?
- That's two-hand touch. Too rough?

129
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,227
Sorry, ladies.

130
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,504
Pick up the outside!

131
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,771
- Fumble!
- Set!

132
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,837
How's that for touch?

133
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,984
- That was pretty, wasn't it?
- Want to go get your pads?

134
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,383
- That the best you got?
- What?

135
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,444
- Here, take a walk...
- And knock a long loose?

136
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,547
- Touchdown.
- First and your last.

137
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,894
- You want to go?
- Nobody's going. We're not going to go.

138
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,199
You almost caught it.

139
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,613
- We stop them here, we win, right?
- Right, boys, last play.

140
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,517
- You know how I like winning.
- We need to put this to rest.

141
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,954
- I will take care of Ray.
- You two cross. You stay in and block.

142
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,992
Booth? Isolate on Vaughn.

143
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,959
- You two cross...
- Just give me the ball.

144
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,360
- Go low. Left knee.
- All right, man.

145
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,361
You got it? On the first hut. Ready? Break!

146
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,826
Be strong.

147
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,270
All right, Chris Vaughn. Last chance.

148
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,505
- Black-nineteen! Black!
- Watch the outside!

149
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,842
I'm open!

150
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,519
That's game.

151
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,727
Sorry about that.

152
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,225
Cool, man.

153
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,772
Nice game, ladies.

154
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,203
What the hell was that?

155
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,244
That was a great game, wasn't it?
Is that the bad one?

156
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,156
- Yeah, it was good.
- Hey, welcome home.

157
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,792
Good to be back.

158
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,859
See you around.

159
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,222
If you're not doing anything later on,
want to come by the casino?

160
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:33,499
Introduce you to some nice girls.
Drinks are on me. What do you say?

161
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,636
- See you tonight.
- Cool.

162
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,570
I'll see you later on.

163
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,172
Be good.

164
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,781
Hey, Sarge. Good game. Maybe next time.

165
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,518
Hold up.

166
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,666
Maybe next time I won't see you
in the bleachers, smoking weed.

167
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,611
Welcome home, buddy.

168
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,373
I thought you had to be Native American
to own a casino.

169
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,681
- Hamilton's one-sixteenth Blackfoot now.
- Put it on his application.

170
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,246
And what he slid under the table
convinced the powers that be it was true.

171
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,987
- It's ours for the taking tonight.
- Let's pick some cherries, boys.

172
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,561
- Here we go.
- I'm feeling lucky.

173
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,531
Just so you guys know,
I'm done after I triple my money.

174
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,591
That's what you said last time.

175
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,637
You wound up selling your body
for bus fare.

176
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,001
He had to walk.

177
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,797
Nobody's going to have any problems
finding this place.

178
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,571
It's the subtle attention to aesthetics
that I find most impressive.

179
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,078
Blends in with the mountain so nicely.

180
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,950
- Hi there.
- Hi. How you doing?

181
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,022
- See? Not bad, huh?
- It's not bad.

182
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,019
A lot of pretty girls.
I'm getting chips. Let's gamble.

183
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,359
We'll see you at the Shower Tower, okay?

184
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,998
Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs
under one great, big roof.

185
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,504
You got your ATM machines,
tellers to cash your paycheck...

186
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,304
and when you're here,
you don't got to worry about things...

187
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:22,780
like child support, rent,
laws of mathematical probability.

188
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,683
Gentlemen, Mr. Hamilton would like
to invite you to the VIP lounge.

189
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,059
- The dream team. You all healed up?
- Nice place.

190
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,303
Welcome to my world.

191
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:51,537
Tonight all the drinks are on the house.
If you need a line of credit, say how much.

192
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,374
If you need
a little female companionship, done.

193
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,005
All right?

194
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,948
- Get inside. Have a good time.
- Where you going?

195
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,181
Don't you worry about me.
I got a few things to do. Enjoy.

196
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,721
Just remember,
nothing in here is free. Ma'am.

197
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,119
- Cherry shot?
- Ray, be nice.

198
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,628
Come on, this place is nothing
but fake boobs...

199
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,133
and real assholes, if you ask me.

200
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,293
Just water for me.

201
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,099
Drink up.
We got money to win and girls just waiting.

202
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,105
- We are VIPs.
- Here's to you, Chris.

203
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,732
- Welcome home.
- Cheers.

204
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,574
Let's play, boys.

205
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,103
Go right ahead.

206
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,179
Already lost $1...

207
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,581
Good night.

208
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,783
Okay. Don't say we never did nothing
for you.

209
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,417
Don't worry, buddy,
everybody's scared their first time.

210
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,425
- Come on.
- Get in there, Chris.

211
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:45,725
Okay, just sit back and enjoy it.

212
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,462
- This'll get you started.
- Lf you're not back by morning...

213
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,899
we'll send a search party.

214
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,800
- Have fun.
- Stop drinking.

215
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,538
You from here, or are you just visiting?

216
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,647
A little of both.

217
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,984
I grew up here.

218
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,150
So you're seeing all the old faces.

219
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,093
You could say that.

220
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,194
Your voice sounds very familiar.

221
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,134
Chris.

222
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,371
Deni.

223
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,837
- Look who's back.
- So, good surprise?

224
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:11,171
I told you it was better than gambling.
You met Candi?

225
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,504
- Hello.
- Hey, Candi.

226
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,137
Let's go.

227
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,950
Six, easy six. Looking for a six to win.

228
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,042
We can do a six. Can we do a six?

229
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,053
I think I can do a six, right?

230
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,320
We got liftoff! Whack it, boys. Whack it.

231
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,517
Blue or pink, what do you think?

232
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,958
Who's up for two out of three?

233
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,933
I'm getting killed. Let me have a C-note
to put $200 on a bet.

234
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,002
- No.
- Come on.

235
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,434
Hell, no.

236
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:40,698
Look at them.

237
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,408
He's hot.

238
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,544
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Give me a hard six.

239
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,573
- $5, hard six?
- Yes.

240
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,378
- I'm in.
- Hard six. $5 on hard six.

241
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,215
There's another $100. Boom.
Give me some dice.

242
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,346
Looking for a six.

243
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,157
All right. Oh, please. Please.

244
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,317
Thank you. And you.

245
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,129
- Jimmy, don't roll. Give me the dice.
- No, I got it.

246
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,462
Hard six, six. Looking for a six.

247
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,895
Seven out. Line in, the dark side wins.

248
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,700
Last come'll get you some.

249
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:22,169
- You're good. But I saw it.
- Saw what?

250
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,413
I saw the switch.

251
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,406
This is a clean game, asshole.

252
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,844
Let's see about that.

253
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,252
Bet you'll roll a seven.

254
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,557
It's not your roll, sir.

255
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,967
Sir, it's not your roll.

256
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,695
Will you call security?

257
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,862
Put your bets down on the passline.

258
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,839
- These dice are coming up seven.
- Why don't we just let it go?

259
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,876
No. We're going to let it ride, Jimmy.

260
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,843
The dice are coming up seven.

261
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,908
- It's not your roll, sir.
- Come on, baby.

262
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,215
- What a surprise.
- No, folks. No payouts.

263
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,778
- Wait a minute.
- Calm down.

264
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,983
Just take care of that bet, then we're even.

265
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,890
I would, but it wasn't a legitimate bet.

266
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,949
You're not the shooter.

267
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,189
- Security.
- It's not your roll, sir.

268
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,794
- Is there a problem?
- The problem is your dice are loaded.

269
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,537
Does your boss know about this?

270
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,373
Just give me my money.

271
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,443
Come on. Let's go.

272
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,797
What now, bitch? Come on!

273
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,945
Special Forces.

274
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,444
Wow. I'll take that.

275
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,631
What are you doing?

276
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,600
Special Forces. Special treatment.

277
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,071
This guy knows Hamilton.

278
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,642
You just hold him down. Come on, Burke.

279
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:57,921
Folks.

280
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,327
He's pretty banged up, inside and out.

281
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,329
Whoever did this left him for dead.

282
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,468
A lesser man wouldn't have survived.

283
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,236
- I need a statement from him, Doctor.
- He's in no condition to give you one...

284
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,039
I'll also need a copy of your write-up,
with toxicology...

285
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,546
- and blood-alcohol level.
- What are you talking about?

286
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,242
I'm just trying to get some facts.

287
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:22,480
You need to be arresting whoever tried
to kill my brother, not testing his blood.

288
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,115
I'm just doing my job, Michelle. Okay?
I understand how you feel.

289
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,216
But we still don't know who started all this.

290
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,558
- It wasn't Chris.
- Just find out who did this to him, Stan.

291
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,429
I'll do my best, Mr. Vaughn. I really will.

292
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,195
In the meantime I have to file a full report.

293
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:41,261
Will you let me know when I can talk to him?
Thank you.

294
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,336
- He's going to be fine, Michelle.
- Thanks.

295
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,134
- Beautiful flowers.
- Thank you. They're for my best friend.

296
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,237
Hey, Sarge. So much for our VIP status.

297
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,048
Don't they teach you
any basic fighting skills in the Army?

298
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,211
How did you do?

299
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,314
Not good. But I tell you,
that guy was feeling me this morning.

300
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:41,196
- You okay?
- That was a hell of a homecoming party.

301
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,725
Chris, I don't know if you noticed,
but this ain't exactly home anymore.

302
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,679
Hang on.

303
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,621
Let me help you. Come on.

304
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,370
I'm good, Mom. I got it.

305
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,378
- Need some help?
- No. I'm just milking it.

306
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,152
There's some old crutches in the garage.

307
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,122
- Thanks, Pete.
- Crutches. That's nice.

308
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,264
Did you see the hole?

309
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,551
- Mind if I watch TV?
- No, that's cool.

310
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,455
- Somebody's feeling better.
- Little bit.

311
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,584
You make this?

312
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,787
Need anything?

313
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,695
- Something wrong?
- No, it's good, man. It's good.

314
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,028
No, I'm good, Dad. Thanks.

315
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,991
- Changed the plugs a while back.
- I appreciate that, Dad.

316
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,690
I might've had serious issues
with your career choice...

317
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,326
but it just didn't seem fair
to take it out on an innocent truck.

318
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,795
Where you headed?

319
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,395
I was going into town to get supplies.
Want to come?

320
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,474
Let's go.

321
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,219
Your whole life,
all you wanted to do was get out of here.

322
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,420
What made you come back now?

323
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,757
You're going to think I'm crazy.

324
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,185
I would think about the mill.

325
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,190
When I was a kid going to visit you at work,
the smell of that fresh-cut cedar...

326
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,731
You remember that smell.

327
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,266
I remember a lot of nice things
before the mill closed.

328
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,140
When did they go out of business?

329
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,215
Closed about six months ago.

330
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,717
There's a Home Depot
about 15 minutes up the road.

331
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,281
And that?

332
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,386
Don't ask.

333
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,380
First of all, I just want to say thanks.

334
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,479
- For what?
- For making that stickman.

335
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,323
He's been fired
and his gaming permit's been pulled.

336
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:31,491
I just have no idea
why my security cameras didn't catch that.

337
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,762
They miss a lot in your place,
don't they, Jay?

338
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,036
- Look, Chris, I hate seeing you like this.
- Your boys did it.

339
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,202
Wait a second.

340
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:49,076
So they got a little rough.
They're a bit edgy. Understandably.

341
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,981
You don't know what kind of assholes
they have to put up with on a daily basis.

342
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,042
Look, they've been reprimanded.

343
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,015
But they say you went nuts, man.

344
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,113
I'm sorry. Insensitive.

345
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,125
I know the proper term that vets use
is post-traumatic stress...

346
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,594
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Whatever. You tore my place apart...

347
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,599
and it wasn't easy to get my guys
to agree not to press charges.

348
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,965
Chris, if you had a problem,
shouldn't you have come to me?

349
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,531
I want to bring you inside.

350
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,339
I want to make you head of security.

351
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,136
- What do you say?
- No.

352
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:34,852
I guess you probably need time
to think about it. I figured as much.

353
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,261
This is for you.

354
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,090
It's a little something to help you get,
you know...

355
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,069
Come on, man, don't be like that.

356
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,472
I came all the way out here to your house,
just to see you get back on your feet.

357
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,106
I'm going to the sheriff.

358
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,141
I'm really sorry you feel that way.

359
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,116
I'll see you around, Chris.

360
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:18,832
I know, it was a good time, wasn't it?

361
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,198
Excuse me.

362
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,837
Excuse me.

363
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,638
I got to call you back.

364
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,847
Hey, Chris.

365
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,185
It's good to see you up and about.
You're looking spiffy.

366
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,982
I'm here to press charges.

367
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,690
This isn't about that incident
at the casino a while back?

368
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:41,918
Yeah. It is.

369
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,228
Because that matter's closed.

370
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:48,559
You're lucky you weren't brought in
on charges. I mean...

371
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,362
Did you even look into it?

372
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,731
They did an internal investigation.
That's good enough for me.

373
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,602
An internal investigation?

374
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,306
I know you're familiar
with the term no-fly zone.

375
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,906
Because that's what the casino is.

376
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,343
Since the mill closed down...

377
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:10,076
that casino is the main source
of revenue in this town.

378
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,282
So case closed, basically.

379
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,255
We'll see you.

380
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,991
- I'm not going to let this stand.
- Excuse me?

381
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:33,601
- What did you say to me?
- I said I'm not going to let this stand.

382
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:39,412
You're lucky to be alive right now.
That's all you need to be concentrating on.

383
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,516
This is my town. Okay?

384
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,545
I'm the sheriff here.

385
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,750
I'll tell you what will stand.
Not the other way around.

386
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,522
Now please get out of my building.

387
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,984
- Come in.
- Thanks.

388
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,112
This belongs to you.

389
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,826
I appreciate that. I thought this was history.

390
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,591
- Could have left it in the trash, but l...
- Deni?

391
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,462
- Nice to see you, dear.
- Hi, Mrs. Vaughn.

392
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,437
Can I talk to you outside for a second?

393
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,770
Quick walk. Mom, I'll be right back.

394
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,440
- How you been?
- Been better.

395
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,412
Talk to the sheriff yet?

396
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,952
I went down to the police station.
I talked to somebody with a badge.

397
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,890
He sure as hell didn't seem
like much of a sheriff.

398
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,517
He's up for reelection, you know.

399
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,292
- Maybe you could take his job.
- Somebody ought to.

400
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,133
How about you?

401
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,105
Nothing but sunshine and pine trees.

402
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,469
Been reading these books.

403
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,476
Teach you how to cultivate your happiness.
Focus on the future.

404
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:16,570
- Go with the flow, that sort of thing.
- Is it working?

405
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,547
I have my moments.

406
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,379
So, the casino, huh?

407
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,148
Yeah. Been there almost a year.

408
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:30,083
- Treating you good?
- A lot better than it treated you.

409
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,996
I like that.

410
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,497
Jay Hamilton's done well for himself,
hasn't he?

411
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,593
He's a real go-getter, that one.

412
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,573
He must be. I heard he got you.

413
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,738
That lasted about eight minutes.
It was a long time ago.

414
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,874
You still work for him, though.

415
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,485
Rent's got to be paid, Chris.

416
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,983
I suppose so.

417
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,420
- Hope to see you around.
- Do you?

418
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,600
Thanks for the jacket.

419
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,312
And where is he?

420
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,188
It's okay, Mom. He's stabilized.

421
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,495
It was close.

422
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,163
Crystal meth.

423
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,738
I'm sorry. I never did it before.

424
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,105
It's true.
We might've kind of pushed him into it.

425
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,877
- Where'd you get the drugs?
- I'm not really sure...

426
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,883
Stop.

427
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,618
Where?

428
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,249
From the security guys
working at the casino.

429
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,285
Chris, wait. Call the police.

430
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,626
No. It won't do any good.

431
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,577
- Is Pete okay?
- He'll be fine.

432
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,648
What are you doing?

433
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,413
No, Chris. Not like this.

434
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,648
Listen to me.

435
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,022
If you go out of here with that gun,
they're going to nail...

436
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,330
I've been looking for you.

437
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:18,031
Guess that changes our relationship
a bit, huh?

438
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:02,346
You should not have come
looking for trouble.

439
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:05,543
Keep your hands up.
Get out of the vehicle now, Chris.

440
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:06,574
Now!

441
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:12,354
- Step back, please.
- Just move toward the front of the car.

442
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,222
Put your hands on the hood.

443
00:41:19,132 --> 00:41:22,829
<i>I advise you to give this offer
more than a little serious thought.</i>

444
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,604
<i>If you go to trial, you stand to do 18 years.</i>

445
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:27,401
<i>Now, this is a sweetheart plea.</i>

446
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:30,500
<i>Normally they wouldn't even
put it on the table...</i>

447
00:41:30,577 --> 00:41:32,943
<i>but your military record can't be ignored.</i>

448
00:41:33,013 --> 00:41:36,244
Three months home arrest,
some community service...

449
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:40,484
- pretty generous offer, Chris.
- But I'd have to plead guilty.

450
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:42,679
Look at it from the other side.

451
00:41:42,756 --> 00:41:46,419
There's over a dozen witnesses,
none of whom will paint a flattering picture.

452
00:41:46,526 --> 00:41:49,120
- He started busting up the machines.
- There was a gunshot.

453
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,493
- He just went crazy.
- A complete psychopath.

454
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:54,227
They're only offering me this deal
just to keep me quiet.

455
00:41:54,301 --> 00:41:56,292
I still say you should take it.

456
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,705
I wasn't wrong. And I won't say I was.

457
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:03,438
<i>Our job is to keep order.</i>

458
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:06,469
There was no chance
of that once he came in.

459
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:10,145
Me and my men,
we were just trying to control him.

460
00:42:11,985 --> 00:42:16,149
He's highly trained, violent.
A very dangerous person.

461
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:21,894
So violent, so dangerous,
so highly trained...

462
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:26,561
that he dispatched six
of the casino security staff single-handedly.

463
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,261
Six men, single-handedly.

464
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:33,829
His weapon of choice,
a simple piece of cedar...

465
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:38,875
which, in his hands,
became a devastating force with one aim:

466
00:42:39,112 --> 00:42:41,842
To hurt people and destroy property.

467
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:49,888
He went directly for everything.
He just came in and took over the place.

468
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,756
- You said he broke your arm.
- Yeah, that's correct. My right forearm.

469
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:58,286
Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.

470
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:01,496
Toss a couple of drunks now and then.

471
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:04,832
Guys try to grope the girls.
But nothing with this sort of violence.

472
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:08,034
Did he give you
any kind of advance warning...

473
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:11,136
a chance to defend yourself?

474
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:14,669
We tussled, but he's a big guy.
He was on a mission.

475
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:18,240
Besides, he seemed to be too busy
enjoying himself from what I could see.

476
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,185
So from what you saw,
he seemed to have some kind of purpose?

477
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:22,448
He had a point to prove.

478
00:43:22,522 --> 00:43:25,616
I was emptying machines
when he came in and started swinging.

479
00:43:25,725 --> 00:43:28,023
- I was trying to get out of there.
- He was a menace.

480
00:43:28,094 --> 00:43:30,062
- A very dangerous person.
- Military-trained.

481
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,688
He seemed like a complete psychopath.

482
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:34,096
- Nothing close to this.
- I didn't know what he'd do.

483
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,657
- I was frightened.
- He came for us.

484
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:37,327
- No doubt in your mind?
- No doubt.

485
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:38,735
I have no further questions.

486
00:43:38,805 --> 00:43:42,832
Mr. Crowe, you may present
your client's case.

487
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,477
You're fired.

488
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:54,175
Your Honor, I'd like to plead my own case.

489
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:57,382
Order!

490
00:44:01,628 --> 00:44:05,792
If you choose to represent yourself,
and not be represented by legal counsel...

491
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:09,767
you realize that you can't
then claim a mistrial on that basis?

492
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:13,338
- Yes, I do.
- Very well, Mr. Vaughn.

493
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,976
I don't deny anything
that was said here today.

494
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:26,382
Does that mean
you're changing your plea to guilty?

495
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:28,114
I'm not guilty of anything...

496
00:44:28,188 --> 00:44:30,486
except standing up for myself
when the law wouldn't.

497
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,491
Objection. He's trying
to introduce prior events.

498
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,791
Sustained. Mr. Vaughn, stay on point.

499
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:41,966
I grew up in this town.

500
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:44,963
People used to walk tall in this town.

501
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:47,696
They wouldn't have traded the mill
for a crooked casino.

502
00:44:47,774 --> 00:44:49,867
We're not here to listen to civic speeches...

503
00:44:49,943 --> 00:44:53,037
And they wouldn't have stood around
while drugs were sold to kids.

504
00:44:53,113 --> 00:44:54,137
- Objection!
- Sustained.

505
00:44:54,214 --> 00:44:57,479
Mr. Vaughn, you're close
to being held in contempt.

506
00:44:57,917 --> 00:44:59,475
I was justified in what I did.

507
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:02,919
And if you acquit me of these charges,
then I'm gonna run for sheriff.

508
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:05,514
- Mr. Vaughn.
- And if elected, I'm gonna fix this town.

509
00:45:05,558 --> 00:45:07,287
Order.

510
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:10,560
Please take your seat.

511
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:13,659
Mr. Vaughn, you are now charged
with contempt.

512
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:15,860
And I will make sure that this...

513
00:45:15,935 --> 00:45:17,061
- Objection.
- Sustained.

514
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:20,402
...never happens to anyone again
without punishing those who did it.

515
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:22,964
I'm ordering the jury to ignore
what they've just seen.

516
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:25,307
Mr. Vaughn, take your seat.

517
00:45:28,882 --> 00:45:30,349
Order.

518
00:45:31,384 --> 00:45:33,909
Or you're all charged with contempt!

519
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:47,566
<i>Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?</i>

520
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:49,329
We have, Your Honor.

521
00:45:49,402 --> 00:45:51,029
Defendant, please rise.

522
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:55,705
We find the defendant, Chris Vaughn,
not guilty.

523
00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:17,296
This is mine.

524
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:27,997
Sheriff Vaughn!

525
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:10,575
You won the election. Congratulations.

526
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,642
But we do have a tradition
of professional courtesy up here.

527
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,883
And I can personally vouch
for each and every one of these men.

528
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,548
They're good deputies.

529
00:47:18,658 --> 00:47:20,250
You're all fired.

530
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:41,965
- Hey, Chris.
- License and registration, please.

531
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:46,239
You're joking, right?

532
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,575
License and registration.

533
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:01,617
What's the problem, Sheriff?

534
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:05,631
You. And the drugs you're peddling
out of your casino.

535
00:49:05,832 --> 00:49:09,791
The only thing that's going on in my casino
is construction. You took care of that.

536
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:12,861
That's right. And I plan on taking care
of everything else, too.

537
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:15,567
If you can, try to think this through:

538
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,302
A casino is a license to print money.

539
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:20,604
Why would I jeopardize that
by selling drugs?

540
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,547
Because you owned the town, Jay.
That's changed now.

541
00:49:23,616 --> 00:49:26,414
Really? The only thing I think has changed
around here...

542
00:49:26,486 --> 00:49:30,081
is that you get to wake up every morning
and put on that nifty little badge.

543
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:34,182
But underneath it is the same guy who
couldn't make it playing college football...

544
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:36,455
and apparently couldn't make it
in the Army...

545
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:38,826
and not really ever gonna make it as a cop.

546
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:40,695
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

547
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,264
And if you push too hard, you're going
to be a man who never gets to see 40.

548
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:50,166
License, please.

549
00:49:57,383 --> 00:49:58,975
Thanks, Sheriff.

550
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:04,757
Sir, get your taillights fixed.
It's your last warning.

551
00:50:04,857 --> 00:50:07,155
What's wrong with my taillights?

552
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:12,153
They're broken.

553
00:50:40,893 --> 00:50:43,885
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

554
00:50:49,802 --> 00:50:50,700
No.

555
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,331
Come on, man. You know I hate cops.

556
00:50:56,409 --> 00:51:00,345
You've been sheriff for about two minutes,
and I'm already starting to hate you.

557
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:02,973
- I'm a convicted felon.
- I've got pull around here.

558
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:06,849
Now you're a crooked cop doing favors
for friends. That's how it starts.

559
00:51:06,919 --> 00:51:10,184
Next thing you know you'll be taking bribes,
setting up roadblocks...

560
00:51:10,256 --> 00:51:12,986
- frisking dudes' crotches.
- Are you done?

561
00:51:17,096 --> 00:51:20,361
- Ray, I need your help.
- Don't do that.

562
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:23,027
I need you to take me to drug school.

563
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,343
I get to wear a uniform?

564
00:51:32,178 --> 00:51:34,840
<i>The stuff in this town
is five-star, factory pure.</i>

565
00:51:34,914 --> 00:51:37,405
<i>- So let's go get the factory.
- Easier said than done.</i>

566
00:51:37,483 --> 00:51:40,646
<i>We know Hamilton's boys
are selling that shit down at the casino.</i>

567
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,779
<i>Yeah, but 99% of the time they're clean.</i>

568
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:45,949
<i>So we got to play follow-the-money,
starting with the tweakers.</i>

569
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,720
<i>That'll give us the suppliers.</i>

570
00:51:47,827 --> 00:51:51,593
<i>These guys are real edgy,
so delicacy is the key.</i>

571
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:54,227
<i>Then we put the squeeze on them...</i>

572
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,427
<i>till they spit out the location
of the next buy.</i>

573
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:58,993
<i>- Where'd you learn that, Ray?
- Cops.</i>

574
00:51:59,939 --> 00:52:01,600
That's a good show.

575
00:52:02,408 --> 00:52:04,308
<i>Phase three: We strike.</i>

576
00:52:04,444 --> 00:52:08,778
<i>- I thought you said delicacy was the key.
- That's right. Delicacy and precision.</i>

577
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:11,577
- Hey, what's up?
- Get out of here.

578
00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:30,400
- You're sure you're not carrying anything?
- I don't have shit.

579
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,628
- Officer.
- Yeah.

580
00:52:36,075 --> 00:52:37,440
Search him.

581
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:44,578
This is going to be a switch.
Spread your legs. Arms down.

582
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,650
You been working out?

583
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:51,953
Nothing there.

584
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,259
Somebody needs a bath.

585
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:08,467
Now you read me my rights,
then you take me in...

586
00:53:09,775 --> 00:53:11,538
and I call my lawyer.

587
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:15,411
Okay. But I have a hunch
there may be something else in here.

588
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:18,341
Could be.

589
00:53:25,057 --> 00:53:27,525
Go to it, Deputy. Have a good time.

590
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,261
- He ain't talking.
- I know.

591
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,883
Handles pretty good.

592
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:43,332
He's clean.

593
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,038
Guess we got to go with Plan B.

594
00:54:50,977 --> 00:54:52,877
Screw you both.

595
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:55,943
I do have a bit of information for you.

596
00:54:56,015 --> 00:54:59,712
It's not just me, actually.
There's a whole lot of people in this one.

597
00:54:59,785 --> 00:55:01,116
Spit it out.

598
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:04,553
You're gonna get hurt.

599
00:55:09,662 --> 00:55:11,129
What an idiot.

600
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:25,039
Why does it always have to be your fight?

601
00:55:28,014 --> 00:55:30,482
- You might need this.
- No.

602
00:55:31,017 --> 00:55:35,511
- I put my guns down a long time ago.
- Come on. You're just being stubborn.

603
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:37,818
You and me both, boy.

604
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:41,720
Chris, listen.

605
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:45,494
You be careful.

606
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:48,093
I will.

607
00:55:58,277 --> 00:56:00,643
<i>Please step away from the vehicle!</i>

608
00:56:00,746 --> 00:56:03,806
<i>Mr. Booth, are you still upset
over that body-cavity search?</i>

609
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:05,749
<i>I forgot, you got no vehicle.</i>

610
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:12,617
<i>Please disperse! There is nothing to...</i>

611
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:16,726
Can I talk to you?

612
00:56:16,796 --> 00:56:18,320
- Sure.
- Over here?

613
00:56:23,035 --> 00:56:27,062
I'm gonna stay here with him tonight.
I need you to look after my parents' place.

614
00:56:27,139 --> 00:56:29,733
Think they're gonna take it that far?

615
00:56:38,451 --> 00:56:41,887
- I'm with you, man. I'll check in later.
- Okay.

616
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:58,468
<i>A drive to right field.
It's dropping for a single.</i>

617
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:08,345
You making house calls?

618
00:57:12,852 --> 00:57:14,843
- Don't shoot.
- Hey.

619
00:57:19,525 --> 00:57:21,925
How's the food around here?

620
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:23,587
Nice.

621
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:27,993
I brought you special treats:

622
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:32,370
Salad, fried chicken...

623
00:57:34,673 --> 00:57:36,368
potato salad.

624
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,637
- Do you have glasses?
- Yeah.

625
00:57:50,389 --> 00:57:53,358
- Do you have to work tonight?
- I quit.

626
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:58,821
I figured you were making some changes
around here...

627
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:00,626
I could make a few myself.

628
00:58:05,237 --> 00:58:06,864
Salt and pepper?

629
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:27,080
- Who is that?
- Pete.

630
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:29,913
- Want something to eat?
- No. I'm good, man.

631
00:59:42,635 --> 00:59:44,626
I got to get a bigger bed.

632
00:59:48,974 --> 00:59:50,441
No, you don't.

633
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:20,563
Do it.

634
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:24,006
I'm hungry.

635
01:00:25,244 --> 01:00:27,041
We've got leftovers.

636
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:33,109
I want pancakes. And eggs. And bacon.

637
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:49,696
I told you, Vaughn.

638
01:00:55,574 --> 01:00:56,905
Stay here.

639
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:05,246
Who needs to step away
from the vehicle now, Vaughn?

640
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:10,589
Truck for a truck, baby!

641
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:14,684
That's right! Truck for a truck!

642
01:01:29,942 --> 01:01:31,204
Get down!

643
01:01:32,778 --> 01:01:34,405
Tear it up, boys!

644
01:01:44,723 --> 01:01:46,748
Pete, something's burning.

645
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:57,700
Take this.

646
01:01:59,071 --> 01:02:00,470
Get in there.

647
01:02:16,755 --> 01:02:18,518
Good morning, honey.

648
01:02:20,926 --> 01:02:22,416
Get out of here.

649
01:02:24,897 --> 01:02:26,762
Sheriff, are you home?

650
01:02:28,734 --> 01:02:31,532
I told you someone was going to get hurt!

651
01:03:07,172 --> 01:03:08,503
Come here.

652
01:03:09,575 --> 01:03:11,975
When I say now, start shooting!

653
01:03:12,444 --> 01:03:13,809
Over there!

654
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:17,577
Stay low.

655
01:03:18,317 --> 01:03:21,218
Vaughn! You got to get me out of here.

656
01:03:24,056 --> 01:03:26,752
Move it. Go! Move it, old man.

657
01:03:26,992 --> 01:03:29,085
- Where's Pete?
- I don't know.

658
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:30,689
Sit down.

659
01:03:32,564 --> 01:03:35,158
- I know who you are.
- Oh, yeah?

660
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:44,266
- Burke?
- Son of a bitch. Check it out.

661
01:04:16,675 --> 01:04:19,109
Come on! Get me out of here, man!

662
01:04:19,878 --> 01:04:22,847
- What's it worth to you? Where's the lab?
- Screw you!

663
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,481
Hamilton's operation is at the mill, okay?
Now get me out of here!

664
01:04:38,764 --> 01:04:39,992
Drop it.

665
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:44,232
Stay down!

666
01:04:47,873 --> 01:04:49,306
Stay down.

667
01:04:56,448 --> 01:04:57,710
You okay?

668
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:06,682
Shit.

669
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:21,067
I thought I warned you, Chris.
I didn't want this to happen.

670
01:05:38,123 --> 01:05:39,590
I'm going in!

671
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,558
Right there, punk!

672
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:50,527
Come on, Chris! Come on!

673
01:06:01,013 --> 01:06:02,344
Deni, now!

674
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:18,650
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

675
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:22,089
I'm sorry.

676
01:07:23,662 --> 01:07:26,256
- Where is everybody?
- Pete ran outside.

677
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:33,995
You stabbed me with a potato peeler.

678
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,531
You gonna be okay?

679
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:41,896
Hey, Chris.

680
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:44,391
Get up, Jay.

681
01:09:44,469 --> 01:09:46,232
Just a second.

682
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:50,070
Remember when we used to play
hide-and-seek up here?

683
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:57,304
- That was my favorite sound.
- Get up!

684
01:09:59,518 --> 01:10:01,645
Look, Chris...

685
01:10:08,593 --> 01:10:12,029
You want to know
what my new favorite sound's gonna be?

686
01:10:12,264 --> 01:10:15,324
The sound of you screaming
like a little bitch.

687
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:20,335
Bet you wish you took that job offer now?
But, no! You had to be Mr. Hero Boy!

688
01:10:20,572 --> 01:10:22,972
You forgot this: This is my town!

689
01:11:16,161 --> 01:11:17,185
Yes!

690
01:12:35,974 --> 01:12:37,498
You're nothing.

691
01:12:53,992 --> 01:12:57,359
You're right, Jay.
This does change our relationship.

692
01:12:57,896 --> 01:12:59,454
This is my town.

693
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,663
You're under arrest.

694
01:13:10,008 --> 01:13:11,771
That ought to do it.

695
01:13:14,713 --> 01:13:16,442
What are you doing?

696
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:19,744
Getting some souvenirs.
I'm gonna miss the place.

697
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:22,181
That's how it starts.

698
01:13:22,253 --> 01:13:26,280
Next you'll be accepting bribes
and setting speed traps all over town.

699
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:29,053
Cutting up trucks. You know how you are.

700
01:13:29,294 --> 01:13:31,762
Not to mention the cavity searches.

701
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:35,296
You're gonna like that.

702
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:38,427
Speaking of which,
do you think Jay's got a casino in the pen?

703
01:13:38,503 --> 01:13:41,870
- Could be.
- Running the Shower Tower with the fellas?

704
01:13:42,273 --> 01:13:45,538
He's probably blowing on
somebody's dice right now.

705
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:49,373
That's lunch.

706
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:51,779
Let's go pick up my old man,
grab something to eat.

707
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,613
I'm with you, buddy.

708
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:40,000
