00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,000
Here, watch Croak.

172
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,333
You can't let a frog loose in here!

173
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,625
[croaking]

174
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,708
Ah!

175
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,291
[croaks]

176
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,250
Who exactly are you?

177
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,625
You just met my mom. I'm Chin.

178
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,166
I got fourth place,
Yanshi City Ping-Pong Club tournament.

179
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,416
- Should've been third.
- [croaks]

180
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,916
Oh, oh, oh, and by the way,
I have a super power.

181
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,375
Can you guess what it is?

182
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,875
Super annoying?

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
[gasps]

184
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,166
I have two super powers!

185
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:29,666
Look over there. What do you see?

186
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,625
A wall?

187
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:36,000
To you, it's a wall.
To me, it's just something to run through.

188
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,833
You can run through walls?

189
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,666
Wanna see?

190
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
Why, yes, I'd love to.

191
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,291
[Chin huffs]

192
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,333
No barriers!

193
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,958
Ahhh!

194
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,041
[thud]

195
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,083
[chuckles] Did you see that?

196
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,708
Almost a whole part of me
went right through that wall!

197
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,541
My molecules opened up.
I could feel them separate.

198
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,416
It's like the universe
was calling me by name.

199
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,625
Ba Ba, he ran into a wall!

200
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,916
[chuckles] Eight-year-old boys
have a lotta energy.

201
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,458
Give him a pass this time.

202
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,750
"This time"?

203
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,500
His mother's very... nice. Yeah?
I mean, you should talk to her.

204
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,333
- Why?
- Don't you ever get a little...

205
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,333
[sighs] well, lonely?

206
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,541
No, never! Why? Do you?

207
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,666
[sighs]

208
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,750
I have you. We have each other.

209
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,166
Um...

210
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,416
Of course, sweetheart,
we're always gonna have each other.

211
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,125
Nothing can ever change that.

212
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,291
But, Fei Fei...

213
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,750
there is something important
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

214
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,458
You know how since...

215
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,750
[woman] Hello!

216
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,416
Anybody order 12 big, hairy crabs?

217
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,041
Move aside.
Good-lookin' is gonna start cookin'.

218
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,833
Hi, Aunties.

219
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:24,791
[sighs]

220
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, Fei Fei, you've gotten so big!

221
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,791
- Hi, Fei Fei!
- It's so good to see you.

222
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,041
Make way for the real cook in the family.

223
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,125
- [giggling]
- Take a look!

224
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,333
[Fei Fei] Oh, yeah, my favorite!

225
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,291
- [Chin] I'm hungry!
- [Ling] That sizzle!

226
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:41,583
[Nai Nai] These dumplings,
almost as good as mine.

227
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,375
[sniffs] Mmm! That's smelling so good!

228
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,166
- Fei Fei, take a bite of this.
- Oh.

229
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,291
- Thanks, Nai Nai!
- Coming through!

230
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,250
You're so skinny.
Hasn't anybody been feeding you?

231
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:57,291
The hairy crab is a burrowing crab,
known for its furry claws.

232
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,125
Hi, Ye Ye.

233
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:03,041
Fei Fei, perhaps we can use my red dates
for our second batch.

234
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,416
Ma Ma preferred melon seeds in the paste.

235
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,791
Oh. Well, my family uses dates
grown in our garden.

236
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,708
If you wanna try one, they're delicious.

237
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,041
- I'm probably allergic to dates.
- Oh.

238
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,416
Besides, we only make them
our special way here.

239
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,250
Okay.

240
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,708
[uncle] Your right or my left?

241
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,375
Seems like this table gets heavier
every year, right?

242
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,000
[Mei] Ooh, hot plate! Careful.

243
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:32,541
[scoffs] No rabbits at the table.
You remember what Ma Ma said.

244
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,208
Besides, that's <i>my</i> chair.

245
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,166
[Mrs. Zhong] The table looks beautiful.
Um, where should I sit?

246
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,333
[Ba Ba] Here, sit by me.

247
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,500
- [Mrs. Zhong] Oh, thank you.
- [Ba Ba] Of course.

248
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,750
- [Mrs. Zhong chuckles] All right.
- [Ba Ba chuckles]

249
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:52,666
The hairy crab invades local waters,
damaging fishing nets and native species.

250
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,958
Ah, look how big and bright the moon is!

251
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,208
You have a little bit of sauce
on the side of your... [giggling]

252
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,625
- It's gonna be huge for the Moon festival!
- [Mrs. Zhong laughing]

253
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,416
- [bowl thuds]
- Ma Ma's favorite holiday.

254
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
[Ba Ba] Uh...

255
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,750
So, your father tells me
you're fond of Chang'e.

256
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:18,666
Oh, poor lady, that goddess!
So lonely up there on the moon.

257
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,041
No one but Jade Rabbit
to keep her company.

258
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,833
Oh, come on!
Chang'e loves it up there alone!

259
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:28,625
That's why she took both immortality pills
instead of saving one for Houyi!

260
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,125
Actually, according to my mother,
I might be related to Houyi.

261
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,875
Houyi, the Archer! <i>Cho!</i>

262
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,958
- [Mrs. Zhong] Chin!
- Ugh! [grunts]

263
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,583
That's not what happened, Auntie.
Houyi was off fighting demons.

264
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,875
With his bow and arrow and...

265
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,750
- When a robber came and tried to st...
- Steal the immortality pills? [scoffs]

266
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:49,416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she only put them
both in her mouth as a hiding place.

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
Not buying it.

268
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:55,875
Chang'e floated to the sky
while her one true love stayed here.

269
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,333
- [sighs]
- And bit the dust.

270
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,541
Now she lives with a rabbit
instead of a husband. [chuckling]

271
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,625
Good choice.

272
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,666
But it wasn't her choice.
She didn't try to leave Houyi behind.

273
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,416
She misses Houyi
and cries for him every day!

274
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,625
And how do you know that?

275
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,208
They text.

276
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,208
- Don't tease Fei Fei.
- It's just a silly myth.

277
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:20,833
It's not a silly myth. It's real.
Chang'e is real!

278
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,083
[all gasp]

279
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,250
- Ah... Fei Fei!
- [Chin] Uh-oh!

280
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,333
[sighs]

281
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:31,208
She's on the moon right now,
waiting for her one and only true love.

282
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,750
Waiting... right, Ba Ba?

283
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,375
[Ba Ba] Uh...

284
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,625
[groans quietly]

285
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,833
Just give her a minute.

286
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,875
[Ling] She's at the top of her class,
but she still believes in Chang'e?

287
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,500
It's you and me, Bungee.
We're the last true believers.

288
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,416
[yelps]

289
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,375
Ow!

290
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,708
[sighs] Not really in the mood!

291
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,000
[sighs]

292
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,125
Know what I am? A bat!

293
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,875
Yeah, a dingbat!

294
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,333
I hope you like dingbats

295
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,541
because you're gonna see
a whole lot more of me.

296
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,458
Whoa! [grunts]

297
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,916
Not if I can help it.

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,458
Haven't you heard?
We're gonna be brother and sister!

299
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:34,083
- What?
- My mom and your dad are getting mar...

300
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,250
Don't say it! Don't!

301
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,333
[Chin gasps]

302
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,083
Hi, Fei Fei.

303
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,041
Hello.

304
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,666
I didn't want you to miss dessert.

305
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh, um...

306
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:51,041
I saved you a special Mooncake
from my hometown... without dates.

307
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,125
[Fei Fei] Uh...

308
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,833
Thank you.

309
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,583
No barriers!

310
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,666
- [thud]
- [Chin grunts]

311
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,541
Ugh.

312
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:05,041
Chin can be rambunctious at times.
But after a while, you get used to him.

313
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,125
[Mei] Zhong! Get over here
before I kick everyone's butt at Mahjong.

314
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,166
[chuckles] Oh, yes. We'll see.

315
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,500
"Get used to him"?
I'll never get used to him!

316
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,125
What's so special about your Mooncake?

317
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:22,916
I don't want it, and I don't want you!

318
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,041
[grunts]

319
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,708
I just want things back the way they were.

320
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,666
[sighs]

321
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,916
He used to believe in Chang'e.
He said she was absolutely real.

322
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,958
But now he's changed.

323
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:44,833
If Ba Ba could only believe again,
he would never marry that woman.

324
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:49,375
He would remember everything.
He would remember you.

325
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,916
[breathes deeply]

326
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,791
Bungee!

327
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,291
Ma Ma... why is this happening?

328
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,375

They're so cool, and you sent them for me.

No, Goddess.

What I mean is, you're the one
who believes that love never dies.

Everybody knows that about you.

571
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:04,375
My dad used to believe that, too,
but now I'm afraid he's giving up.

I wish it had given you
everything you wanted.

You know, the Moon festival

My Nai Nai always told me

the circle of a Mooncake
is the symbol of a family coming together.

Sorry. [chuckles]

he may end up
as your sister's next science experiment.

Chang'e must be so sad,
hidden behind those clouds,
