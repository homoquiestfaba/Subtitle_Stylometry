1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,409
# Love me tender,
love me dear

2
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:14,080
# Tell me you are mine

3
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,618
# I'll be yours

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,089
# Through all the years

5
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,493
# Till the end of time

6
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:31,402
# When at last
my dreams come true

7
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:35,140
# Darling, this I know

8
00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:42,181
# Happiness will follow you

9
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:47,354
# Just before I go.

10
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,686
My name is Ted Morgan.

11
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:16,390
Right now I'm moments
away from death.

12
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,828
No reason for you
to feel bad, though.

13
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:21,596
I mean, I don't.

14
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,431
This is actually
the first time in my life

15
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,835
that I've accomplished something
I set out to do.

16
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,373
And it's fitting for me
to die here in Lake Wamsutta

17
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,776
because, to be honest,
it's probably the only place

18
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:35,179
I ever really felt alive.

19
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,883
I used to come here
with my dad when I was a kid,

20
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:39,852
but we didn't
come here to fish.

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,889
No, we had bigger plans.

22
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,424
See that thing in the sign?

23
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,326
That's Wammy,
my hometown's answer

24
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:48,195
to the Loch Ness monster.

25
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:50,231
But Wammy was real.

26
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:52,434
We had actual footage
shot by my dad,

27
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:55,203
plus eyewitness accounts
from local alcoholics.

28
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:59,675
My dad saw the good
in everything.

29
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:03,914
He taught me that the world
was a safe and decent place.

30
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,817
Only it wasn't.

31
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:08,586
He got sick and
before I knew it...

32
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,789
he was gone.

33
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,459
My brother Lucky
comforted me that day

34
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:15,829
for the first and only time
in his life.

35
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:18,299
But he couldn't
take my dad's place.

36
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:21,569
Go! Sit!
What's wrong with you?!

37
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:24,873
Ted: In the movies,
a sympathetic teacher often steps up.

38
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,244
But Edwina Lawrence
never went to the movies.

39
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,314
I used my art to
express myself

40
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,350
and I showed them.

41
00:02:33,352 --> 00:02:36,688
But then they showed me.

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,658
They took my best friend.

43
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:47,267
My mother never found a man
to replace my dad either.

44
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,604
So she fell in love
with the King...

45
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:51,673
named Shirley.

46
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:55,644
Meanwhile, I was being tortured
by the school bully,

47
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:57,346
Rawly Stansfield.

48
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:59,416
So when I was old enough,

49
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:01,484
I moved as far away
as I could

50
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,988
and I never thought
of Wammy again.

51
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:06,924
It was a silly thing
to believe in anyway.

52
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,928
As you can tell
by where I am right now,

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,897
life never got much better.

54
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:15,401
So I went out west
where I just blended in.

55
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,373
I worked my way up
to a mid-level job

56
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,577
at a mid-level company...

57
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,913
and watched the years go by,

58
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:27,583
all from the safety
of a mid-level life.

59
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,592
Hey, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

60
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,830
- And then I met Penny.
- Here we go.

61
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:40,566
Wow, he's really heavy.

62
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,568
I'm Penny.

63
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,837
I'm Ted.

64
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:49,377
For three years,
she was everything to me.

65
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,345
Everything I wasn't.

66
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,986
Penny loved life

67
00:03:57,254 --> 00:03:58,988
and I loved Penny.

68
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,990
Unfortunately,
so did Nate,

69
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,626
her guitar teacher.

70
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:12,471
Do you think this is
how I wanted it to end, Ted?

71
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:14,807
I thought that we could
grow together,

72
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,944
but you are stuck.

73
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:20,448
What am I supposed
to do without you?

74
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,650
What did you ever do
with me, Ted?

75
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:25,788
You have no passion

76
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,925
and I don't wanna
end up like you.

77
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,760
You might as well be dead.

78
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,033
Maybe she was right.

79
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,403
Maybe I should just end it.

80
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:44,610
After all, there was no one left
to talk me out of it.

81
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:53,688
Even total strangers agreed
that I was wasting air.

82
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:02,966
It was obvious to me.

83
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,969
It was time to punch out.

84
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:17,851
But I didn't want to
go out like this guy.

85
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,724
My life had been
a complete failure, sure,

86
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,426
but at least I could get
my death right.

87
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:37,642
I needed to go back to Kempton
and confront my own predators.

88
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,447
Just before I go.

89
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:56,698
Hey, Ted!

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,769
Teddy!
Over here!

91
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,509
You got shotgun.

92
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,714
Honey!
Kids!

93
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,051
They're gonna freak out.

94
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:14,987
Hey,
everybody gather round.

95
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:18,158
Here.
You sit here.

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,194
No, no, you stay.

97
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:23,998
Okay, okay, fam damily.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,569
You all remember
your Uncle Ted?

99
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,170
He's my only brother.

100
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,572
He's gonna be
staying with us for a while.

101
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:32,175
- We know, Dad.
- Right...

102
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:34,211
but what you don't know
is why.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,180
And, uh...
can I be frank here, Teddy?

104
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,916
- Preferably not.
- Your Uncle Ted's here

105
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:42,154
'cause your Aunt Penny,
who you only met, like, twice

106
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:43,656
a hundred years ago,

107
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,825
and now... warning,
I'm gonna talk to you

108
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:48,028
like we're adults now...
is a cunt.

109
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:53,101
- Okay, I'm a little sleepy.
- Now, those of you who know me

110
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:55,737
know that I don't throw
that word around lightly.

111
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:57,907
It's an ugly word,
it's a disgusting word.

112
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,676
Great orifice.
Gives us babies,

113
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:02,746
but it's a terrible word
sometimes,

114
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,681
but your aunt is a cunt.

115
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:06,684
So I never want to hear
the word "Penny"

116
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,052
spoken ever again.

117
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,921
When you think
you want to say "Penny,"

118
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:14,894
What if we want to cash in
a roll of pennies at the bank?

119
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,663
- Do we say it then?
- No.

120
00:07:16,665 --> 00:07:18,298
You look that teller in the eye
and you say

121
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:20,968
you would like some cash
for this roll of cunts.

122
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,070
You have my permission.
I'll sign a slip or something.

123
00:07:23,072 --> 00:07:25,173
- Luck, come on.
- I'm sorry, I digress.

124
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:28,711
And even though
he's been kind of a dick

125
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:32,715
for barely calling or anything
for the past two years,

126
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,218
doesn't matter anymore...

127
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,656
'cause my baby brother's back.

128
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:46,633
Okay, I'm getting
a little emotional here.

129
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:49,303
And you all know
I break things when I cry,

130
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:53,074
so I'm gonna let
little brother Ted speak.

131
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,909
Uh...

132
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:57,980
Hi.

133
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,882
I know it's been a long time
since I've been back here

134
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:03,219
and just want to thank you guys
for letting me stay with you

135
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:07,058
during this...
transition period.

136
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,861
- My breakup with your Aunt
Penny... - Cunt.

137
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,833
Aunt... Cunt...

138
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:16,736
has been difficult.

139
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:19,139
It's nice to have family
to turn to.

140
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:22,711
Well, Teddy, we're really happy
that you're here staying with us.

141
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:25,880
Honey, enough speeches.
Give the man a break.

142
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,917
He just flew 3,000 miles.

143
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,285
- Let's get this man some food.
- Ow!

144
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:32,022
Oh, God.

145
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:34,958
All right, here we go.

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,961
Bathroom's in there.

147
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,203
Your dad said
you drew these.

148
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:46,006
You're talented.

149
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:48,408
Well, they're shit,

150
00:08:48,676 --> 00:08:49,944
but thanks.

151
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:54,349
What's with the deadbolt?

152
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,285
You're gonna want
to use that.

153
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:01,124
Dad will tell you.

154
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,027
- Good?
- Yeah.

155
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,212
Kathleen?

156
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:25,386
Whoa.

157
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kathleen!

158
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:31,461
What are you doing?

159
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:34,130
No, don't do that.

160
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,469
That's a bad idea, Kathleen.

161
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:42,274
It's a bad idea.
You should go back to bed, okay?

162
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:44,811
No!
No! No!

163
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:48,882
My God,
it's like you're playing banjo.

164
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:52,386
Oh, jeez.

165
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,059
Oh, shit.

166
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:59,261
Lucky, I was sleeping.
She just walked in, I swear.

167
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:02,866
- I don't know...
- Shh. You're gonna wake her.

168
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,235
You never wake
a sleep masturbator.

169
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,072
- What?
- I'll explain in the morning.

170
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,143
Didn't Zeke tell you
to deadbolt the door?

171
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:14,113
Okay, honey,
beddie-bye time.

172
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:16,950
Come on.

173
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:18,818
Yeah, yeah.
Shh.

174
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,824
Oh, hey.
Hey, Teddy,

175
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,228
there's banana cream pie in the
fridge if you get hungry, okay?

176
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,063
I'm good.

177
00:10:28,065 --> 00:10:29,899
I can't...

178
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,281
Mom, I can't find
any clean pants.

179
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:44,216
- Look in your closet.
- Ah, shit!

180
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,386
Oh...
I'm sorry, honey.

181
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:50,056
- What?!
- Ugh, for the love of Pete.

182
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,003
Yeah, it's been going on
for the past few years.

183
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:02,539
Every time someone sleeps over,
she sleepwalks in there,

184
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,374
starts rubbing her button,

185
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,243
two minutes later it sounds like
a chick's hatching.

186
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:09,281
- Is she seeing a doctor?
- They gave her this Zoloft shit,

187
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,283
but she still does all the same
crazy sleep stuff.

188
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,887
Wow.

189
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:17,056
You should see the things she
does to me when she's sleeping.

190
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:20,194
She punches me,
slaps me, kicks me.

191
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:22,597
She took a shit on my pillow
right next to my head.

192
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:27,436
I'm talking this giant rosebud,
like, inches from my eyebrows.

193
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,575
I'd kill to wake up and find her
knuckle-deep in her own pussy.

194
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:34,144
Jeez.

195
00:11:34,146 --> 00:11:35,947
I'm sorry, Luck.

196
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:37,315
Well, fuck it.

197
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,250
Gonna see Mom today?

198
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,919
The Monte Carlo's
at your disposal.

199
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:43,088
I got something I
gotta do first.

200
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,958
Dude, you gotta see Mom.

201
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,527
Of course, yeah, I will.
I just...

202
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,362
gotta do this thing first.

203
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,416
Good morning,

204
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:09,320
I'm looking for one
of your old people.

205
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:12,424
- Edwina Lawrence.
- Friend or family?

206
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,026
Actually, I'm one of her
former students.

207
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:15,527
She was my
seventh grade teacher.

208
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:19,299
Oh, and you've come back
after all these years to visit.

209
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,670
- How sweet.
- Yeah.

210
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:27,643
42, 43... ha-ha,
oh, Shirley.

211
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:30,580
- Hello.
- Ah, fuck you.

212
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,582
Okay.

213
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,088
Hmm.

214
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:47,667
Mrs. Lawrence?

215
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,638
Mrs. Lawrence, it's Teddy.

216
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,008
Ted Morgan.

217
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,343
From the seventh grade?

218
00:12:55,345 --> 00:12:57,246
Are you stupid?!

219
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:59,648
How many times
do I have to say it?

220
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,584
The numerator
goes into the denominator.

221
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:04,287
Four.
Four times!

222
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,655
Take your seat.

223
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:09,026
Go! Sit!
What's wrong with you?!

224
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:13,198
I think some children
in this class know math, right?

225
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,666
You were pretty mean to me.

226
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:17,737
Actually, you were more
than just mean, you were cruel.

227
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,041
Probably the cruelest person
I've ever met.

228
00:13:21,043 --> 00:13:23,510
I was popular
before seventh grade.

229
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:26,114
I had friends.

230
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:28,384
You made me a joke.

231
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:31,687
You picked on me every day.
Why?

232
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:33,523
I never did anything to you.

233
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:39,430
I was polite.
I was an A student.

234
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:42,101
Jesus,
my father had just died!

235
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:45,270
Why were you such a miserable
cocksucking bitch?!

236
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,407
They took my dog Pepper
because of you.

237
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,743
He was my best friend.
They took him away because of you.

238
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,713
I never saw him again.

239
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:55,249
I flew 3,000 miles
to tell you how you set my life

240
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,220
on the path to ruin
and this is funny to you?

241
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:00,656
Well, fuck you!

242
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:04,093
Fuck you, you dried-up,
withered, douchebag.

243
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,797
Fuck you and the giant tarantula
you rode in on!

244
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,699
You old clam!

245
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,602
What the fuck are you
smiling about?!

246
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:12,303
Ow!
Jesus!

247
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:14,173
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

248
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:16,308
What are you doing
calling my grandmother

249
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,178
a withered old clam?
Help!

250
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,646
Wait, wait, I can explain.
Ow!

251
00:14:19,648 --> 00:14:22,282
- Rape!
- Rape? Seriously?

252
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:24,285
This is Massachusetts, people
still come running for rape.

253
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:27,723
Shh, don't move.

254
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,425
What, the cat?

255
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,160
It's not any cat.

256
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,632
No, no, no, no,
Grandma, no.

257
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:38,169
Is she allergic?
You want me to get rid of it?

258
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:40,137
No, you can't get rid of Death Kitty.
If he comes into your room

259
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,140
and sleeps on your bed,
you die.

260
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:47,814
Oh, thank God.

261
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:50,350
Thank God.

262
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,754
Who are you?

263
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,824
You're serious?
You came back here

264
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:57,792
to yell at my grandma,
fight a bully,

265
00:14:57,794 --> 00:14:59,795
and then kill yourself?

266
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:02,231
Uh, isn't that a
little fucked up?

267
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,334
I think that any plan
that ends with suicide

268
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,503
is probably
a little fucked up, yeah.

269
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,607
No kids?

270
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,209
Nope.

271
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,479
Is this like a cry for help?
Am I supposed to tell someone?

272
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:17,784
- No, please don't.
- So I'm just supposed to walk away

273
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,855
and let you... kill yourself?

274
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:22,890
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:25,427
I'm an idiot, but, yes,
I was hoping so.

276
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:32,735
Hey,
I know you don't think so,

277
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,471
but someone is gonna care

278
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,540
and they're gonna be
really pissed off

279
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:38,877
and they most likely
won't ever forgive you.

280
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:45,417
There's a time,
there was a point in time

281
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,820
When we just stopped listening

282
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,690
There's a ghost
and it haunts this town, yeah

283
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,593
It haunts it up and down...

284
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:55,830
You're a mess,
you're a fucking mess

285
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,300
If you don't know that by now...

286
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,536
- Teddy! Oh, my God!
- Hey, Mom.

287
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:03,306
- Oh...
- Good to see you.

288
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,844
Oh, honey.
What a surprise.

289
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:10,314
Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

290
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:13,485
Oh, Margaret Margolis.

291
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:15,354
10% kidney function.

292
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:16,956
No feet.

293
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,459
I don't want you to ask

294
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:20,727
- How I am...
- Hi, baby!

295
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,429
- Hey.
- Let me look at you.

296
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:25,867
I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay...

297
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:29,872
- God. That's a sandwich.
- Ooh.

298
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,608
I can't tell you how good it is

299
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,744
to see my baby boy again.

300
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,346
- Thanks, Mom.
- Ooh.

301
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:39,784
Let the boy breathe, Nance.
You're practically motorboatin' him.

302
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,485
Oh...

303
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:44,656
- It's good to see you, too, Mom.
- How are things?

304
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,359
Shirley,

305
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:48,695
do you have to do that
in the kitchen?

306
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,463
Sorry, baby.
Sorry.

307
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,799
So, Shirley,
how are you feeling?

308
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:54,001
Good, Ted.
Can't complain.

309
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,437
Thank you very much, baby.

310
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,572
Shirley's making a comeback.

311
00:16:57,574 --> 00:17:00,543
- Really?
- Yeah, look at this.

312
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,649
Wow.

313
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,950
The Marshfield chili cook-off.

314
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:08,719
Opening for Sha Na Na.

315
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,488
You're gonna come, right?

316
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:14,893
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

317
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:16,762
Mom, do you remember
Vickie Serrone?

318
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,665
Oh, yeah, very nice girl.

319
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,668
She works checkout
at Shaw's Supermarket.

320
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,903
Wow.

321
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,038
She's worked there
since high school.

322
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:26,975
Shelves, too.

323
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,910
This girl knows
where everything is.

324
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:30,879
Every aisle, every item.

325
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,483
You just try to stump her.

326
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,953
Two weeks ago
I went in there and I said, uh,

327
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,755
"I'd like some capers. "

328
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,692
You know what she did?
She said, "Aisle seven, bottom shelf. "

329
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:43,995
- Amazing.
- I don't even know what a caper is.

330
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,800
- Ouch!
- Shirley!

331
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,572
Hey, big mama.

332
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,977
- Where's my coffee?
- Almost ready, puddin'.

333
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,580
You could've given me a little
heads up on Elvis' comeback.

334
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:01,850
More like "Love Me Tenderloin. "
Woman is packing on the poundage.

335
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:05,422
Went to a pancake breakfast
with her last month...

336
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:06,923
there was more batter
spread that day

337
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,994
than on the inside of a
Boy Scout's sleeping bag.

338
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,801
What do you got back there?

339
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,571
- A case of marshmallows?
- Oh.

340
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,444
Mmm.
That is good.

341
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,814
Oh, you put your
secret ingredient in there.

342
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:26,981
Tell him what
your secret ingredient is.

343
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,983
Love.

344
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:31,921
Love.

345
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,433
You're so beautiful.

346
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:48,041
Teddy,
I'm trying to take a nap.

347
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,776
Get out of here.

348
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:52,580
Ted, I'm trying to sleep.

349
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:55,983
Get over here.

350
00:19:11,437 --> 00:19:13,605
What are you doing here?

351
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:17,543
I've decided that I'm gonna
document this suicide thing of yours.

352
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:19,980
Jesus,
would you keep it down?

353
00:19:19,982 --> 00:19:21,715
And, no, absolutely not.

354
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:22,983
Why?

355
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:25,787
Look, I'm sorry
about your grandmother, okay?

356
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,791
I'm sorry I told you
what I told you, but no way.

357
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,092
Ted, think about it.

358
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:32,929
When the end comes
and you have to write that note,

359
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:35,665
I mean, the note,
explaining all this,

360
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:38,969
you won't have to because
I will have edited together

361
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,973
a snappy little 30-minute
presentation that will explain it all.

362
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:44,142
- Why are you doing this?
- To help.

363
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:45,977
Also, this is kind of my field.

364
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:48,614
- You do documentaries?
- No, I work at Town Hall

365
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:50,583
and I record
all of the town meetings,

366
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:53,921
so, yeah, kind of a documentarian,
record keeper.

367
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,590
- Greta, right?
- Yeah.

368
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:57,459
It was nice meeting you.
Goodbye.

369
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,097
I'll tell.

370
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,802
I'll tell your brother
what you're gonna do.

371
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,804
I don't want to.

372
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,174
I would much rather document
your impending death,

373
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,909
but... it's your call.

374
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,649
Yes!

375
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,686
So let's rehash.

376
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:24,024
So far you've screamed
at a 90-year-old lady

377
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,160
and called her
a "cocksucking bitch,"

378
00:20:26,162 --> 00:20:27,729
and now you're going to
fist-fight

379
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:29,998
someone you haven't seen
in 22 years?

380
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,268
You've got to admit that's a
pretty fucked-up bucket list.

381
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:34,704
You ever heard of
"getting your house in order"?

382
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:37,007
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm getting my house in order.

383
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,743
Yeah, but why do
you have to kill yourself?

384
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:42,580
Why not just right your wrongs
and then keep on going?

385
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:45,217
Because...

386
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:47,119
it's what we cowards do.

387
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:02,204
So you're just gonna
walk up to this guy and say,

388
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,074
"Hey, remember me? You used
to pick me up by the nipples

389
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:08,712
during gym class 20 years ago. "
And then, wham?

390
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:10,147
Pretty much.

391
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:13,218
Hey, Ted, get up.

392
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:16,756
I'm hungry.
Let's go, get out of here.

393
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:22,863
Excuse me.
Uh, you wouldn't happen to have

394
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,700
- any spare change, would you?
- Buzz off, loser.

395
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,972
- I have some change, Ted.
- So gross.

396
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:31,340
Don't give him
any money, Vickie.

397
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,008
He's just gonna give it
to Rawly Stansfield

398
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,745
'cause he's too big a pussy
to stand up to him.

399
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,650
Thanks.

400
00:21:39,652 --> 00:21:42,153
Thank you.

401
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,922
Sorry about that.
Come on.

402
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,728
Gross, dude,
it's fucking wet.

403
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,897
Tomorrow I want dry money.
All right?

404
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah.

405
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:58,239
- Hi, is Rawly Stansfield here?
- Yeah, he's right there.

406
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:03,012
Please don't be Rawly.
Please don't be Rawly.

407
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:04,981
- Please don't be Rawly.
- I'm Rawly.

408
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,651
- Oh, shit.
- Be with you in a second.

409
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,227
Okay, let's go.

410
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:16,929
No.

411
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:19,799
Ted, I know that your list
is very important to you,

412
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,002
but unless you've decided
to add having someone feed you

413
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:24,038
your own legs,
I suggest we go.

414
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,340
It's not a list.
It's just a few things.

415
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,777
Besides, I'm armed.

416
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,312
It's my brother's blackjack.

417
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:32,414
It's filled with powdered lead,
you just...

418
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,050
one blow to the
side of the head,

419
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,719
he'll go down
like a ton of fertilizer.

420
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,989
Ted, the man
just walked out of here

421
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,058
with 200 pounds of hay
on his shoulders

422
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,394
like it was a fucking parasol.

423
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:45,296
I suggest you key his pick-up
and call it even.

424
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:46,666
No.

425
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:51,805
Jesus, it's like "Jurassic Park"
when he walks.

426
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,740
You looking for me?

427
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:55,142
Yeah.

428
00:22:57,346 --> 00:23:00,082
You don't remember me, do ya?

429
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:01,917
No.

430
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
I'm Ted.

431
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:05,388
Ted Morgan.

432
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,791
We went to school together.

433
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,860
Teddy?!

434
00:23:09,862 --> 00:23:12,229
Teddy Morgan,
holy shit, man!

435
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:15,367
Good to see you!

436
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,369
What's going on?!

437
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,439
What's it been?
Like 20 years or something?

438
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,276
Ted, man...

439
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,845
I was such a dick.

440
00:23:24,847 --> 00:23:27,449
A huge di...
I mean like the biggest dick.

441
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:30,318
Mother of all dicks, for sure.

442
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,423
I think about it all the time,
too, you know?

443
00:23:34,425 --> 00:23:36,193
My dickness.

444
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:39,129
I'm a totally different person,
you gotta believe me on this.

445
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,232
I mean I...
I'm not such a dick anymore.

446
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:44,368
I'm a pretty happy dude, actually.
You know?

447
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,072
Well, for what it's worth, I...

448
00:23:47,074 --> 00:23:50,110
I really appreciate you
acknowledging your dickness.

449
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:53,079
You bet.
You deserve it, man.

450
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:55,449
It all changed for me
when I met my wife.

451
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:58,085
Uh... late wife.

452
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,455
- Aw, sorry.
- Yeah.

453
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:03,025
You remember her, Teddy?
Kathy Sorenson.

454
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,894
Little bitty thing.

455
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:06,262
She was president
of the French Club.

456
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:07,531
- Ah. - Remember she
had a dead tooth,

457
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:09,933
like, until eighth grade?
Kind of a bubble butt.

458
00:24:09,935 --> 00:24:11,468
- Yeah, sounds familiar.
- Yeah.

459
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:13,371
How'd she pass?

460
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:16,842
Uh, it was a...
it was an aneurism, actually.

461
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,479
We have a son.
Henry.

462
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,382
- All right. - Yeah, he's just
about the sweetest kid

463
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:23,850
you'd ever want to meet
in your whole life.

464
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:25,453
- Rawly!
- Sir.

465
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:27,321
You know where I caught
this little guy?

466
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:30,259
Throwing rabbit pellets
everywhere.

467
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,461
I told you,
this ain't no goddamn day care.

468
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,129
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry?!

469
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:38,001
It's hard to tell who the
dummy is at times.

470
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,341
Hey, Henry,
how you doing?

471
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:44,943
Come sit here with me.

472
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:47,145
Want you to say hi to my friend.
Say "hi" to Ted.

473
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:50,049
Hi, Ted.

474
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:51,384
- That means he likes you.
- Hey.

475
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:54,254
- This is Greta, his friend.
- Hottie.

476
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,103
Hey, baby bro.
You hungry?

477
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,605
Kathleen really outdid
herself tonight.

478
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:10,541
Meat loaf.

479
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,076
I almost gave myself
a speeding ticket

480
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,444
'cause I couldn't wait
to get home and dig in.

481
00:25:13,446 --> 00:25:15,414
Thanks.
I'm kind of tired.

482
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,282
Oh, come on.

483
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,252
It only tastes a little bit
like dog food.

484
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:05,241
Kathleen.

485
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:08,244
Oh, no.

486
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:09,613
Come on!

487
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:13,451
You know what?
Just speed it up.

488
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:15,120
Speed it up.

489
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:19,358
How come you never
hear her get out of bed?

490
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,329
Shut up. How come you
don't deadbolt the door?

491
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,698
I did!

492
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:37,447
Hey, guys,
find a cunt, pick it up,

493
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:39,482
all day long you've
got good luck.

494
00:26:44,222 --> 00:26:47,559
I'm having to rethink this
whole Penny/cunt thing.

495
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:50,363
Ted, school starts
in 15 minutes.

496
00:26:50,365 --> 00:26:53,333
I'll meet you in the car.
All right?

497
00:26:55,304 --> 00:26:57,705
Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

498
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:00,508
Whether 'tis nobler
to suck dick.

499
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,677
Will you fu...
leave him the fuck alone.

500
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,648
What? What do you got against
having a little fun, dude?

501
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,585
So, Romeo, what is it?
Are you a top or a bottom?

502
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,421
What, you don't remember, Pete?

503
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:15,426
That afternoon under the bleachers
must have meant nothing to you, huh?

504
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,199
- Fuck you.
- Stop! Stop.

505
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,735
Relax. Will you get
the fuck outta here?

506
00:27:22,003 --> 00:27:25,105
Stop.
Come on, man.

507
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,775
Hey,

508
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:31,213
you were supposed
to pick me up this morning.

509
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:34,149
Hello,
I am talking to you.

510
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:36,519
I'm trying to film
a suicide note here.

511
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,354
Can you stop
and help a girl out, please?

512
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,690
You know why
I didn't pick you up?

513
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,525
Because this is none
of your business, that's why.

514
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,595
Oh, oh, okay.

515
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:46,364
Fine.

516
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,669
Yeah, hi, is this
the police department?

517
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,407
I need to speak with
the chief of police right away.

518
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:56,677
It's an emergency.
It involves a family member.

519
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:59,447
- Yeah, I can hold.
- You're full of shit.

520
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,550
Oh, really?

521
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:03,519
Do you hear that?
That's Scandal.

522
00:28:03,521 --> 00:28:05,789
That's the official hold music for
the Kempton police department.

523
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:09,125
It's really too bad, too,
because I have this way

524
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:11,529
of helping you cross a thing
off your list.

525
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:16,168
Shootin' at the walls
of heartache

526
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,602
Bang, bang

527
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:20,173
I am the warrior...

528
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:24,611
Well, I am the warrior...

529
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:27,748
- Why aren't you buying anything?
- 'Cause I don't want anything.

530
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,784
I heard an old friend works here.
Thought I'd say hi.

531
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:32,587
Hmm, okay.
Well, fine by me.

532
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:34,790
I needed a box
of emergency plugs anyway.

533
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:37,194
I'm more at the tail end
of my period,

534
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:40,597
so it's kind of a precaution,
but, you know, good to have.

535
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,267
If it's okay with you,
maybe we could keep a little mystery

536
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:44,669
with our totally not knowing
each other at all?

537
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:47,873
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Did I share too much,

538
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:50,409
Mr. I'm Gonna Kill Myself?

539
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:52,712
Ted Morgan?

540
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:54,280
Vickie Serrone?

541
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,183
I have some change, Ted.

542
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,189
Thanks.

543
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,297
- Wow.
- Where have you been?

544
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:10,667
I haven't seen you in years.

545
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,304
I've been living
out in Los Angeles.

546
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:14,839
You visiting
your mom and Lucky?

547
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:17,208
Uh, yeah.

548
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,245
Yeah, it's been
a long time, so...

549
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:21,380
Anyways,
what have you been up to?

550
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,583
You look great.

551
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:25,452
Ted, it's okay,
I've seen my reflection.

552
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:28,389
My feet, no,
but my reflection...

553
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,558
Are you married?

554
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,595
I sure as hell wouldn't let myself
get like this if I wasn't.

555
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,765
I'm Vickie Dansik now.

556
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:38,835
- Five kids.
- Five?! Wow.

557
00:29:39,103 --> 00:29:40,738
Is this your wife?

558
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,741
Um... no, no.
She's, um...

559
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:48,747
Greta.
I'm a... friend of the family.

560
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:51,784
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

561
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:54,254
I'd love to catch up.
Maybe we could go out for a drink.

562
00:29:54,256 --> 00:29:56,823
- Sure.
- Great.

563
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,526
Let me get your number.

564
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:04,266
I'm sorry.
What was that all about?

565
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:06,835
She was one of the few people
who was ever kind to me.

566
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,572
Is that enough info?

567
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,740
Yeah, but what do you
have to catch up on?

568
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,376
I mean,
you're gonna kill yourself.

569
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,513
What, are you trying to drum up
attendance at your funeral?

570
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:19,484
Holy shit, she's like
a part of your list, isn't she?

571
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,354
I mean,
I don't know what part,

572
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:23,790
- but am I right?
- So what if she is?

573
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:27,595
- Look, are we done today?
- You are one sick fuck.

574
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:28,929
I'm glad you're amused.

575
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, really.

576
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:34,002
Look, you can go,
you can do your thing,

577
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:35,805
but we have to do
one thing first.

578
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:38,407
Trust me, this is a stop
you're gonna want to make.

579
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:42,012
Okay, so, they give her
her meds at 10:00.

580
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,515
It's 11:00 now. This is when
she's most coherent.

581
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,651
So the rules are,
you can tell her

582
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:48,654
what your beef is... period.

583
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:51,357
You can say you hate her
or whatever else you want,

584
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:53,793
but no shouting,
no swearing,

585
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:55,662
no obscene gestures, got it?

586
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:58,599
- Can I flick her in the forehead?
- No! You can shake the bed a little.

587
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,753
My dad left when I was three.

588
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,022
I remember that
they were fighting.

589
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,559
I was sweeping.

590
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,362
I started hitting him
in the foot with the broom.

591
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:28,670
Then I was yelling,
"Stop, stop. "

592
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:31,973
And then the next time
I saw him was...

593
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,976
right after my mom died.

594
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:38,448
I thought that he was coming
to take me with him...

595
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,850
'cause he brought me
this big bag of candy.

596
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:43,854
Like bigger than my head
and a dress.

597
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:48,860
And then that night he and
Nana got in a really big fight

598
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:51,064
and...

599
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:52,999
the next day he was gone.

600
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:57,938
And the next time
that I saw him was, um...

601
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:03,011
two years later
at his funeral.

602
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,982
I'm sorry.

603
00:32:06,984 --> 00:32:08,752
I know how hard it was
to lose a parent.

604
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:10,654
I can't imagine losing both.

605
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:14,058
You know, it wasn't losing
the actual them that was so hard

606
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:17,730
'cause they weren't really there
to begin with, but...

607
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:19,732
it was the idea...

608
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:24,104
of them that was crippling.

609
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:32,948
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

610
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,883
Are you good
at climbing trees?

611
00:32:34,885 --> 00:32:37,053
What?

612
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:41,992
Oh, shit, this is high.

613
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,929
Relax, worst-case scenario,
you slip and die.

614
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:46,131
Mission accomplished.

615
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:51,070
What's that for?

616
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:52,738
Carve your initials.

617
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,641
See?

618
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:56,743
Susan plus Greta.

619
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:59,113
That's me and my mom.

620
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,916
We came up here,
like, the week before she died.

621
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:05,020
Your mom climbed a tree a
week before she died of cancer?

622
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,892
Where there's a will,
you know?

623
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:11,494
Anyway... carve.

624
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:15,199
You have to
leave something behind.

625
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:18,203
Some proof that...
that you were here.

626
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,873
Who knows,
a hundred years from now,

627
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:25,011
two people who we'll never know
could be sitting in this same tree

628
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:26,780
looking at our initials.

629
00:33:26,782 --> 00:33:28,782
And that's important why?

630
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:31,986
Because then it's like
we're still here.

631
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:34,757
# There's a sweeter something

632
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:40,230
# And I will hold it
in my heart...

633
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:43,167
So, what are you up to now?

634
00:33:43,435 --> 00:33:45,937
I'm meeting Rawly
for beers tonight.

635
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:49,208
Can you believe I've gone from
wanting to beat him senseless

636
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:50,943
to letting him buy me a beer?

637
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,580
No one said the path to killing
yourself was gonna be easy.

638
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,117
Thanks for being
my death muse.

639
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:09,799
Oh, the joy of nothing...

640
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:14,004
- Hey, Greta.
- Is a sweeter something

641
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:17,942
- I'm sorry about your grandmother.
- And I will hold it in my heart...

642
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:21,180
Try not to do anything
too interesting tonight, okay?

643
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,891
Oh, shit, I gotta tell you
about this fucking...

644
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:33,061
crazy dream I had last night.

645
00:34:33,063 --> 00:34:35,831
Me and you went to this
real fancy restaurant

646
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,735
and the waiter came up
and it was your father.

647
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:41,271
And he was, like,
telling us we had to leave,

648
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,807
that they wouldn't serve us.

649
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:46,076
So I got mad, right?
I was like, "That's bullshit. "

650
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:48,079
And I looked to you
and I'm like,

651
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,282
"Tell him how fucked up
this shit is. " Right?

652
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:56,223
And when I look at you,
you're standing right behind him.

653
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,859
You're a waiter, too,
and you're telling me to leave.

654
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:02,797
I couldn't believe it.

655
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:08,571
Well, in my defense,
it's not because you're gay.

656
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,709
It's because we just...
we just...

657
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,111
we just don't serve niggers.

658
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:19,117
I knew you didn't like black
people. You are so racist.

659
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:22,822
You're not all black.

660
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,791
That's true.

661
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:28,796
Come on.

662
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:31,266
# I'm an open heart

663
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:34,069
# It feels like we've come so far...

664
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:36,839
Just promise me
you'll talk to somebody.

665
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:40,310
Anybody.

666
00:35:40,578 --> 00:35:42,913
# Show me your open heart...
- Okay.

667
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:45,917
# Till we fall in the love
that we started

668
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:48,386
# Show me your open heart

669
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:52,157
# Oh.

670
00:35:54,796 --> 00:35:56,363
They just couldn't stop
the bleeding, you know?

671
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:58,265
I'm sitting there thinking...

672
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:02,136
"It was a sneeze.

673
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:04,806
It was a fucking sneeze. "

674
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:07,243
Something inside her head
just blew.

675
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,047
Just like that,
she was gone, you know?

676
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,983
I don't know, fuck.

677
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:15,753
And then I had to go home.

678
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,989
I had to tell Henry.

679
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:20,760
And he's like, you know...

680
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,729
He's like, "Where's Mama?
Where's Mama? Where's my mama?"

681
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:28,268
That's the saddest sneeze story
I've ever heard.

682
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:34,877
He's the biggest fucking asshole to
ever slip an arm through a sleeve.

683
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,115
He wouldn't close the store

684
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:41,217
the day of her funeral.

685
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:43,387
Jeez.

686
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:46,757
He doesn't acknowledge his grandson
because he has Down's syndrome.

687
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,396
Who the fuck
could hate Henry?!

688
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:53,066
Who?!

689
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,971
Hey.

690
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,841
I'm really sorry about the way
I treated you in school.

691
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,811
If I were you,

692
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:05,046
maybe a little bigger,
a little tougher,

693
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:09,085
I'd want to kick my ass
for the shit I put you through.

694
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:11,254
That fucking old man,
I swear to God,

695
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:13,790
he made me his punching bag
since I could walk.

696
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:16,794
I don't know...

697
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:19,131
maybe I just needed
a punching bag, too.

698
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:21,200
That doesn't make it right,

699
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:23,435
but I am truly sorry.

700
00:37:24,939 --> 00:37:27,073
Don't worry about it.

701
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:29,977
All right,
I want you to take that

702
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,313
and I want you to smash me
in the head with it.

703
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:35,817
You need to hurt me
like I hurt you.

704
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:41,825
- I don't want to do that.
- I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight

705
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:44,962
unless you bring the pain,
bitchpants.

706
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:46,264
I can't!

707
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:49,200
Do it!
Just do it!

708
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:51,504
Do it, you fucking pussy,
or I swear to God I will make you...

709
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:56,510
God! Fuck me!
Come on!

710
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:59,847
Motherfuck-bucket!

711
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:03,918
Last train a-running
between the water

712
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,555
- With a power line...
- Oh, fuck, yeah!

713
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:10,460
Last train's a-running
around the hill...

714
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,197
- You sure you're okay to drive?
- Oh, fuck, quit asking me that.

715
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,901
I only live like six miles
from this fuckhole.

716
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,503
- All right.
- Dude, so great seeing you.

717
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,172
- You, too, buddy.
- Oh.

718
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,973
- That was fun.
- Oh, my God.

719
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:24,010
You're a good man, Ted.

720
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:26,045
Hey...

721
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:28,515
hey, can I ask, uh...
can I ask you a favor?

722
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:30,083
Yeah, sure.

723
00:38:31,922 --> 00:38:34,923
Would you help me
kill my dad?

724
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:36,559
Why not?

725
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,928
Yes!

726
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,063
- All right.
- All right.

727
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:42,566
- I'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

728
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:48,406
# You gotta be huffin' and puffin'
and chuggin' like a choo-choo train

729
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:50,509
# Choo-choo

730
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:54,447
# A-huffin' and puffin' and chuggin'
like a choo-choo train

731
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:57,383
# Choo-choo...
- I'm awake. I'm awake.

732
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,388
# Choo-choo

733
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:04,059
# A-huffin' and puffin'...
- Shit.

734
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,428
I saw it was your
Monte Carlo, Chief,

735
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,065
thought maybe you'd tied one on
and needed a lift.

736
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:11,000
No, I let my kid brother use it.

737
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:12,402
He's kind of going through
some shit.

738
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:14,538
Well, just so you know,

739
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,541
it was twice
the legal limit, so...

740
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:19,510
Oh, yeah? It was twice
the legal limit, huh?

741
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:23,616
I could say the same thing
about your boobies.

742
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:28,054
You should see 'em
underneath the shirt.

743
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,626
- See 'em out of uniform.
- I don't feel good.

744
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,261
- What's the matter?
- I don't feel good.

745
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,563
Yeah, well...

746
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,299
hey, I'll see you at
lunch tomorrow, okay?

747
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,969
- Hey, hey. - I'd like to see
you at lunch tomorrow.

748
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,371
- Yeah? That can be arranged.
- Oh.

749
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:50,548
Oh, God.

750
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,146
You wanna talk?

751
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:23,088
Okay.

752
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,092
Look at that one.

753
00:40:26,094 --> 00:40:28,395
These are...

754
00:40:28,397 --> 00:40:30,597
- really...
- Gay?

755
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,069
Yeah.
Yeah, they're...

756
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,704
they're really gay.

757
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:39,442
- So you're...
- I think so.

758
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:42,679
You think so?

759
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:45,048
I mean, you know,
I have a boyfriend.

760
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,652
- Oh.
- Yeah, I suck his dick.

761
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,754
Oh, okay.

762
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:52,658
Yeah, you're...
you're probably gay.

763
00:40:54,694 --> 00:40:57,564
What do you want me to do?
You want me to talk to your dad?

764
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:59,633
Or are you just gonna tell people
through cock drawings?

765
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:05,207
Um...

766
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,476
no, my dad is...

767
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:11,748
I think I'm just sitting with it
right now.

768
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:13,350
You know?

769
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,687
I think I just kinda needed
to tell somebody.

770
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,089
Say it out loud.

771
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:30,270
So, last month at school...

772
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,776
I was walking down the corridor
with a couple buddies of mine

773
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:36,745
after practice.

774
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:39,448
Coming the other way is,
uh, Ralph Brooks, right?

775
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,585
He's a skinny little blond kid.
He's...

776
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,287
gay.

777
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:46,724
Anyway, you know,
he's... he's walking towards us

778
00:41:46,992 --> 00:41:51,163
and... and me and him
make eye contact

779
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:53,432
and he gives me this... this...

780
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:56,536
just like fucking
half smile thing, like...

781
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,341
You know, like he knows...

782
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,211
or something.

783
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:05,447
Well, I panic.

784
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:06,815
You know,
so when I passed by him,

785
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:10,152
I mean, I just slammed
my shoulder into his chest.

786
00:42:12,056 --> 00:42:14,191
I mean,
I did it fucking hard.

787
00:42:15,426 --> 00:42:16,694
Wow.

788
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:20,164
You know, he just... drops.

789
00:42:23,636 --> 00:42:26,206
He's just sitting there
and he's staring up at me.

790
00:42:30,245 --> 00:42:33,848
I've never hated anyone as much
as I hated him in that moment.

791
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,425
I mean, I don't...

792
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:44,661
I mean,
I don't wanna like guys.

793
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:56,208
I don't want to be
hated like that.

794
00:43:00,181 --> 00:43:03,351
I don't know.

795
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:11,494
Here we go.

796
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:13,530
Can I get you anything else?

797
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:15,199
I think we're good.
Thanks.

798
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,807
I think somebody likes you.

799
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,443
Don't be a dick.

800
00:43:24,445 --> 00:43:25,945
Come on, that kid is gayer

801
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:28,448
than a mouse shoved up
the ass of a gerbil

802
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,918
shoved up the ass of a
sixth grade music teacher.

803
00:43:31,186 --> 00:43:34,322
Why are you such an asshole?

804
00:43:34,324 --> 00:43:36,491
Relax, I'm joking.
Jesus.

805
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:37,860
You're not funny.

806
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,662
He didn't hear me.

807
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,766
I'll tell you what.
I'll tickle his bag on the way out.

808
00:43:42,768 --> 00:43:45,468
Make nice, okay?

809
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,372
- Idiot.
- And people think I'm funny.

810
00:43:48,374 --> 00:43:49,874
Yeah, your wife
thinks you're a riot.

811
00:43:50,142 --> 00:43:51,343
What's that
supposed to mean?

812
00:43:52,845 --> 00:43:55,381
Fuck you. That woman
worships the ground I walk on.

813
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,717
Why is she masturbating
in front of me, huh?

814
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:58,918
I told you,
she's a sleep masturbator.

815
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:01,889
- She's awake and you know it.
- Oh, yeah?

816
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:04,359
She's pissed at you and that's
how she's getting you back.

817
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:06,528
The woman shit on your pillow,
for Christ's sake.

818
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,963
She was asleep!
God damn it,

819
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:11,500
she was dreaming about the time
her cat had kittens.

820
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,604
Is she asleep when
she spits in your coffee?

821
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,842
I've seen it, Luck.

822
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:25,918
I got this.

823
00:44:28,522 --> 00:44:29,990
Oh, and, uh,
you're welcome

824
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:32,526
for the free room, board,
and transportation, too.

825
00:44:32,528 --> 00:44:33,995
Asshole.

826
00:44:39,836 --> 00:44:42,538
After the birth of Margie,
my third,

827
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,743
I was back in a size four
a month later.

828
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:48,646
I was always thin.
I could always bounce right back.

829
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:51,716
You remember how my parents
owned that Laundromat, right?

830
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:54,353
Yeah, the Fluff and Fold.

831
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:56,355
God, I hated that place.

832
00:44:56,357 --> 00:44:59,626
Every day we would
just have to wade through

833
00:44:59,628 --> 00:45:01,828
a mountain of other people's
dirty laundry.

834
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,600
I just thought,
"I will never be like my parents. "

835
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,704
I mean, how can they spend
their lives washing and folding

836
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,906
other people's sweat
and stains?

837
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,412
Then one day
I was in my cellar

838
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:20,084
washing my fourth, fifth, sixth,
load of dirty clothes

839
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:22,587
while I folded another
from the dryer

840
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:25,058
when I heard the
cellar door open

841
00:45:25,326 --> 00:45:28,461
and a whole new pile
was tossed down.

842
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:30,564
And I thought...

843
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:35,603
"Oh, my God. "

844
00:45:35,605 --> 00:45:37,472
Let's do a shot.

845
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,410
- That sounds great.
- Yeah.

846
00:45:41,412 --> 00:45:44,114
Okay, so be honest.

847
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:47,485
You're actually kinda happy that my
grandmother's dead, aren't you?

848
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,855
- No.
- Come on, don't lie.

849
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:52,891
I'm not lying.

850
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,127
Not long from now,
when I'm in the afterlife,

851
00:45:55,395 --> 00:45:57,964
I'm gonna bump into Mrs. Lawrence
and it's gonna be all awkward

852
00:45:57,966 --> 00:46:01,802
and I'm gonna be like,
"Hey, Mrs. Lawrence, how are you?"

853
00:46:01,804 --> 00:46:03,871
And she's gonna be
all like fake nice to me

854
00:46:03,873 --> 00:46:05,941
'cause, you know,
in heaven you gotta be polite.

855
00:46:08,512 --> 00:46:10,146
You know what?
You're really kinda funny.

856
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:12,482
Thanks.

857
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:17,921
So... why do you think

858
00:46:17,923 --> 00:46:20,558
you wanna kill yourself?

859
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,633
I just got tired of trying
to find reasons not to.

860
00:46:33,676 --> 00:46:35,610
Do you know that
I fell in love with you

861
00:46:35,612 --> 00:46:36,979
in fourth grade?

862
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:39,982
Geography class.
You sat right in front of me.

863
00:46:39,984 --> 00:46:42,085
I couldn't take
my eyes off you.

864
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:45,789
You were so pretty and kind.

865
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:48,726
You knew all your continents.

866
00:46:48,728 --> 00:46:50,996
Did you really think
I was kind?

867
00:46:50,998 --> 00:46:53,765
I don't feel kind.

868
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:55,001
What do you feel like?

869
00:46:55,003 --> 00:46:57,637
Like a cautionary tale.

870
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,008
I did what was safe,
what was expected.

871
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,776
I love my kids, but...

872
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,978
I bet you're a great mom.

873
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,114
I don't wanna be
just a great mom.

874
00:47:06,116 --> 00:47:10,219
I want to matter and not just
as a mom to my kids and Albert,

875
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:13,023
but to me.

876
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:14,624
I wanna matter to me.

877
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:17,829
You matter.
You matter to me.

878
00:47:20,432 --> 00:47:23,869
There's no reset button,
is there, Teddy?

879
00:47:23,871 --> 00:47:25,804
You don't need one.

880
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:31,011
You're the sweetest, most gentle
person I've ever known.

881
00:47:31,013 --> 00:47:32,713
I've always wondered
how differently my life

882
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:34,582
would have turned out
if I was with you.

883
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:40,990
You know, I remember

884
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:44,060
you used to eat an apple
every day for lunch.

885
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:45,963
They're God's toothbrush.

886
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:48,832
You always wore
7UP Lip Smacker.

887
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,668
To this day,
that's my favorite soda.

888
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,937
Your book report
on reptiles and amphibians

889
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:56,075
in the sixth grade was...
incredible.

890
00:47:56,077 --> 00:47:57,944
I got a B.

891
00:47:57,946 --> 00:47:59,813
Oh, that's fucking bullshit.

892
00:47:59,815 --> 00:48:02,215
# Love all day, baby

893
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:05,820
# No need to decide

894
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:08,590
# Well, should I live a lie

895
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:11,093
# So I can find...

896
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:13,930
I'll meet you at the Willow.
It's up a block.

897
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,231
You sure you want to do this?

898
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,201
Ted, if you're looking
for absolution,

899
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:19,303
I don't think either one of us
is getting that.

900
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:22,240
So we either have sex
and live with it,

901
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:23,942
or we don't.

902
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:26,946
Okay, I'll see you there.

903
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:30,284
# Well, it might just blind you

904
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:33,820
# Before light, baby

905
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:39,228
# It might just blind you

906
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:42,665
# Before

907
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:47,972
# Light, babe.

908
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:58,651
Hey, man.
See you tonight.

909
00:48:58,653 --> 00:49:01,355
10:00 PM.
Huh? Huh?

910
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:03,591
Yeah.

911
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,762
Oh, my God.

912
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:10,733
# I love the sun

913
00:49:10,735 --> 00:49:12,268
# I love the moon

914
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:15,305
# I love the way
you make me swoon...

915
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:23,247
Look there.

916
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:25,317
- Hmm?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, here.

917
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:29,055
There's the two of you off on one
of your Wammy expeditions.

918
00:49:30,558 --> 00:49:32,927
Probably made a thousand
trips out on that lake.

919
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,896
- Uh-huh.
- All boils down to 37 photos

920
00:49:35,898 --> 00:49:39,401
of a spare tire, schools of fish,
and a drowned muskrat.

921
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:41,771
Well, I beg to differ with you.

922
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:44,173
You have way much more
than that.

923
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:47,344
You have
countless hours together.

924
00:49:47,346 --> 00:49:49,179
Just the two of you.

925
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:52,350
Talking and sharing
and searching.

926
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:55,254
Searching for what?

927
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:58,958
We could have done the same
thing playing catch in our backyard.

928
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,232
Your father wanted to have
an adventure with you boys.

929
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:09,104
You have made
my life complete

930
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,073
- Never...
- Shirley.

931
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:13,243
I'm sorry, baby. Sorry.
Excuse me, baby. Excuse me.

932
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:14,944
- Thanks.
- Sorry, Ted.

933
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:16,946
- Sounds good.
- Thank you, baby.

934
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:19,116
Thank you very much.

935
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:21,752
As soon as you could talk,

936
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:24,756
you were obsessed
with Wammy.

937
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:27,193
You had the lunchbox,
you had the T-shirt,

938
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:28,928
you had the little cap,
you had everything.

939
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,032
If it said "Wammy,"
you had it.

940
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:35,002
And your father thought

941
00:50:35,004 --> 00:50:37,105
it would be so fun

942
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:40,276
for just the two of you
to go find him.

943
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:43,312
I thought Dad
was the one who started it all.

944
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:46,283
He knew everything about Wammy.
He was a Wammy encyclopedia.

945
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:49,854
He was a Teddy encyclopedia.

946
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:54,193
Searching for Wammy
was your father's gift to you...

947
00:50:54,195 --> 00:50:56,161
because you were so practical.

948
00:50:56,163 --> 00:51:01,935
And he knew
that you needed wonder.

949
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:17,187
Rawly, are you sure
about this?

950
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:19,056
I mean,
I know he's a dick, but...

951
00:51:19,058 --> 00:51:21,092
But what?

952
00:51:21,094 --> 00:51:23,928
That miserable bastard
ruined my life.

953
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,465
He treated me like shit
since I could stand.

954
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:28,501
He was cruel to my dead wife,

955
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:31,071
he treats Henry
like a stray fucking cat, man.

956
00:51:31,073 --> 00:51:33,540
Fuck him!
I'm going up there.

957
00:51:33,808 --> 00:51:36,210
I'm gonna strangle his ass
with my bare hands.

958
00:51:36,212 --> 00:51:39,348
I'll be the last thing
his bulging eyes see

959
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,052
before he takes his long trip
to the dark recesses of hell.

960
00:51:44,955 --> 00:51:47,858
Okay, sounds like
you've given this some thought.

961
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,293
Come on.

962
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:55,967
All right,
you rotten son of a bitch.

963
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:57,436
It's payback time.

964
00:52:07,116 --> 00:52:08,583
Shit!

965
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:10,252
Dad?

966
00:52:10,254 --> 00:52:12,254
Daddy?
Hey, Dad!

967
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:16,226
Shit! Don't just stand there,
Ted! Call 9-1-1, man!

968
00:52:16,228 --> 00:52:18,361
I... I thought you were here
to kill him, remember?

969
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:20,131
He was the asshole
who ruined your life,

970
00:52:20,133 --> 00:52:21,899
he's mean to your wife,
called Henry

971
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:23,936
- the "Little Engine That Couldn't. "
- Ted, what the fuck, man?!

972
00:52:23,938 --> 00:52:25,370
You're being really insensitive
right now!

973
00:52:25,372 --> 00:52:27,139
Fucking do something!
He's having a heart attack,

974
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:28,908
for Christ's sake!
Help me! Help me!

975
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,476
- God damn it!
- What's happening?

976
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:32,278
Daddy!
Dad?

977
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,303
I got it.

978
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,174
Thank you.

979
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,660
Vickie?

980
00:53:12,963 --> 00:53:16,566
What... what are you
doing here?

981
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:19,103
The other night made me think.

982
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:21,572
I've lived my whole life
for other people.

983
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,109
For what?

984
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:26,344
We've been in love with each other
since the fourth grade.

985
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:28,080
You said so yourself.

986
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:30,216
What?

987
00:53:30,218 --> 00:53:33,253
I don't want
to fight it anymore.

988
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:35,623
I want to give us
the chance we never had.

989
00:53:38,494 --> 00:53:42,231
But you have kids
and a husband.

990
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:45,235
I had them the other night, too,
when you took me from behind.

991
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:46,403
They had sex!

992
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:49,140
I can see it. Set me on fire.
Start with my eyes.

993
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,641
Get out!

994
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:56,148
Look, Vickie,
that night was wonderful.

995
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:58,518
It was the best.

996
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,553
I never orgasm like that orally.

997
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:03,123
I'm still alive.
Mercy killing.

998
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,426
I just...

999
00:54:05,428 --> 00:54:09,097
I think we should
slow down a bit, you know?

1000
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:11,199
- Discuss...
- Vickie!

1001
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:13,302
- Vickie!
- Albert.

1002
00:54:13,304 --> 00:54:15,137
He must have found my note.

1003
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:18,275
- Don't get upset!
- You wrote a note?

1004
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:20,745
Slow down!
Come on, get in here.

1005
00:54:21,013 --> 00:54:23,147
- Vickie!
- Who the hell is this?

1006
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:25,584
Come home.
I need you.

1007
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:27,453
The kids need you.

1008
00:54:27,455 --> 00:54:29,556
Jake hasn't stopped crying.

1009
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,691
I can't get him to eat.

1010
00:54:31,693 --> 00:54:34,428
I wrote this...

1011
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,364
after our LuLu was born.

1012
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:38,700
Is he gonna read a poem?

1013
00:54:38,702 --> 00:54:41,436
"I was alone.

1014
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:43,139
Dinner alone.

1015
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:45,174
Television alone.

1016
00:54:45,176 --> 00:54:46,309
Work alone.

1017
00:54:46,311 --> 00:54:49,079
Live alone.

1018
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:51,482
Sleep alone.

1019
00:54:51,484 --> 00:54:55,186
I thought that was good,
being alone.

1020
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:57,356
Then I met you.

1021
00:54:57,358 --> 00:54:59,258
Then we had kids,

1022
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,129
and I realized
how sad I was alone. "

1023
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:06,134
I mean, I'm no expert,
but shouldn't that rhyme?

1024
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,669
Okay, shh, shh, shh.

1025
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:11,707
- I didn't mean... yeah.
- It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

1026
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,742
You go... there.

1027
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,413
I think Jake's allergic
to fish sticks.

1028
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:20,351
It's all I can cook him
and he keeps throwing up.

1029
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:23,622
You got 300 pounds of mother of
five blubbering at my table.

1030
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:27,125
You gotta kick that one back
into the ocean, tout de suite.

1031
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:29,362
- Would you skip the fat jokes?
- Okay.

1032
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:31,764
But you and a whole lotta lovin'
gotta figure this out.

1033
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:34,735
I'm sorry.
Sorry, last one.

1034
00:55:34,737 --> 00:55:38,473
Uh-oh! Your hair's on fire!
Gotta get that.

1035
00:55:38,475 --> 00:55:40,575
Hey!
Come here!

1036
00:55:42,446 --> 00:55:44,113
Hey, Romeo.

1037
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:49,786
Don't be fucking rude, dude.
Look at me when I talk to you.

1038
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:52,123
There just ain't much
to look at, man, that's all.

1039
00:55:56,029 --> 00:55:59,666
Aha, look out, Zeke.
I think he's got the hots for you.

1040
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:02,268
Fuck off, guys.
Can we go to class, please?

1041
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,406
Yeah, I'm done
with this guy anyway.

1042
00:56:07,642 --> 00:56:09,678
Oh, uh, hey, Mr. James.

1043
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,446
Come on.
Guys, let's go.

1044
00:56:13,383 --> 00:56:15,651
- What's up, Mr. James?
- Everything okay, Romeo?

1045
00:56:15,653 --> 00:56:18,222
Amazing.

1046
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,632
- Tall cappuccino.
- Thank you.

1047
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:33,840
Hey, you Ted?

1048
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:35,610
Yeah.

1049
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:37,478
- I'm Zeke's friend.
- Oh.

1050
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,380
Do you go to school together?

1051
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:45,255
We do a lot of things together.

1052
00:56:45,257 --> 00:56:47,857
Oh, okay.

1053
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:51,629
I love him,
I just can't live like this.

1054
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:54,733
You know, I'm fine being a secret,
I'm used to that, but I'm...

1055
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:58,371
I'm not okay with being
less than a secret.

1056
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:02,509
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what it is you want me to do.

1057
00:57:02,511 --> 00:57:04,811
Just be there for him.

1058
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:07,682
You're the only one that knows
he's gay besides me and...

1059
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,689
I'm breaking up with him and he's
gonna act like he doesn't care,

1060
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,491
but he will.

1061
00:57:15,493 --> 00:57:18,428
And eventually it has to come
out, even if he can't.

1062
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:22,967
I don't know,
just be there for him.

1063
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:37,451
This is all right,
this is all right

1064
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:39,854
This is all right

1065
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,294
This is all right,
this is all right

1066
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:46,762
This is all right...

1067
00:57:46,764 --> 00:57:48,899
I never wanted you
to leave your family.

1068
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:52,470
You should open with that
next time.

1069
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,842
Us big women with five kids,

1070
00:57:56,844 --> 00:57:59,011
kindness is like...

1071
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:00,981
a dinner bell.

1072
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:03,350
We'll always answer.

1073
00:58:05,554 --> 00:58:10,392
Funny thing,
another day... who knows.

1074
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:12,861
I might not have, but...

1075
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,864
that's the thing about days...

1076
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:18,768
they have a mind of their own.

1077
00:58:20,472 --> 00:58:22,373
I'm so sorry.

1078
00:58:24,343 --> 00:58:25,810
I know you are.

1079
00:58:27,513 --> 00:58:29,448
Now...

1080
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:31,550
go fuck yourself.

1081
00:58:36,324 --> 00:58:37,759
Yeah.

1082
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:42,364
# It's not a last call, but

1083
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:45,601
# Ooh

1084
00:58:45,603 --> 00:58:49,873
# It's time to go home...

1085
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:58,950
# I wear your heart
on my sleeve

1086
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:05,526
# I wear your heart
on my sleeve

1087
00:59:08,564 --> 00:59:13,336
# You wear your heart
on my sleeve

1088
00:59:16,506 --> 00:59:20,744
# I wear your heart
on my sleeve...

1089
00:59:32,927 --> 00:59:35,095
Oh, man.

1090
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:45,508
# We're not the end
of every sentence...

1091
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,877
I know you're awake, Kathleen.

1092
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:51,982
I know you spit
in my coffee, too.

1093
00:59:55,955 --> 01:00:00,526
# It's not a last call, but

1094
01:00:03,831 --> 01:00:07,769
# It's time to go home

1095
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:15,644
# You wear your heart
on my sleeve

1096
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:23,421
# I wear your heart
on my sleeve

1097
01:00:25,124 --> 01:00:29,127
# We are not the end

1098
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:33,099
# But it's almost gone

1099
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,837
# Not all we are

1100
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,742
# It's not all you are

1101
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:46,015
# We can't wait so long,
but we waited for...

1102
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,617
You must be Ted.

1103
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:51,154
Yeah, I'm Ted.

1104
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,663
What, you don't want her
anymore?

1105
01:00:57,665 --> 01:01:00,132
It was never my intention
to take her.

1106
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:03,937
Well, what was your intention?

1107
01:01:03,939 --> 01:01:07,041
Vickie's a big girl,
she's got five kids.

1108
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:09,677
I know what I see in her, but...

1109
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:11,780
you, I don't have a clue.

1110
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:15,218
It doesn't matter.

1111
01:01:15,486 --> 01:01:17,787
We made a mistake.
She wants to come back.

1112
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,624
What a set of balls you have.

1113
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:24,195
You blow a family apart
and say it doesn't matter?

1114
01:01:24,197 --> 01:01:25,997
No, I don't mean it like that.

1115
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:32,071
My life is really complicated
right now.

1116
01:01:32,073 --> 01:01:33,673
No shit.

1117
01:01:33,675 --> 01:01:36,676
You just inherited
a single mom with five kids.

1118
01:01:37,946 --> 01:01:39,981
Albert, I'm...

1119
01:01:39,983 --> 01:01:41,817
I'm leaving.

1120
01:01:41,819 --> 01:01:43,886
I'm never coming back, ever.

1121
01:01:47,191 --> 01:01:48,625
It's your call.

1122
01:01:52,097 --> 01:01:55,200
You're not gonna tell me
why you did it?

1123
01:01:55,202 --> 01:01:56,801
Does it matter?

1124
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,909
Yeah, it matters, 'cause everything
fucking matters.

1125
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,015
I don't know.

1126
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:11,920
- Memories?
- Memories.

1127
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:17,761
Memories are like a magpie.

1128
01:02:17,763 --> 01:02:19,863
It picks up all the...

1129
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:23,301
bright and shiny shit and pays no
attention to what really matters.

1130
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:28,006
Tell her I'll think about it.

1131
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,861
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1132
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,367
Our condolences.

1133
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:55,707
- Mrs. Phillips?
- Ted Morgan?

1134
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:58,344
- Oh, my. - I can't believe
you remember me.

1135
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:01,180
Oh, of course I do.

1136
01:03:01,182 --> 01:03:04,250
I had you and Lucky.
Eighth grade geography.

1137
01:03:04,252 --> 01:03:05,752
That's right.

1138
01:03:05,754 --> 01:03:08,055
I always liked you better.

1139
01:03:08,057 --> 01:03:10,257
Lucky gave me
a ticket last year.

1140
01:03:10,259 --> 01:03:12,394
He said it was
for being too cute.

1141
01:03:12,662 --> 01:03:15,397
Aren't you nice to come
and say goodbye to Edwina

1142
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:18,334
after she treated you
so horribly?

1143
01:03:18,602 --> 01:03:21,171
Yeah, I could never really
figure that out.

1144
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:23,140
I guess I just had
one of those faces.

1145
01:03:23,142 --> 01:03:26,344
No, you had her son's face.

1146
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:29,782
He left right after
Greta was born.

1147
01:03:29,784 --> 01:03:31,350
Broke her heart.

1148
01:03:31,352 --> 01:03:34,855
And I guess she was taking
that broken heart out on you.

1149
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:37,324
Oh, she's such a tragic girl.

1150
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:40,828
Growing up without a father
and that thing with her mother.

1151
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,966
Yeah, I know. Cancer.
It's an awful way to go.

1152
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:47,370
No, her mother
didn't die of cancer.

1153
01:03:47,372 --> 01:03:49,339
She took her own life.

1154
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:53,044
Poor little thing,
she was only seven.

1155
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:58,116
Hmm.

1156
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,793
Hey, you.

1157
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,073
You all right?

1158
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:20,210
People leave.
It's okay.

1159
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,483
Wake's over.
Let's go.

1160
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:28,353
# But I know you can

1161
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:35,161
# Swallow it whole...

1162
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,398
Can I ask you a question?

1163
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,200
Fire away.

1164
01:04:41,036 --> 01:04:43,371
Why don't you
have a boyfriend?

1165
01:04:43,373 --> 01:04:45,006
You're really pretty.

1166
01:04:45,008 --> 01:04:48,444
You're totally crazy,
but really pretty.

1167
01:04:48,446 --> 01:04:51,448
# When you feel your soul...

1168
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,851
I know your mom
didn't die of cancer.

1169
01:04:55,888 --> 01:05:00,226
# Let it be this way
till the end of time...

1170
01:05:00,228 --> 01:05:03,362
I'm sorry for lying.

1171
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:05,966
You must think that I'm...

1172
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,469
like some kind
of crazy person.

1173
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,238
I understand.

1174
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,039
You do?

1175
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,376
You know,
it's not your fault.

1176
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,047
You didn't deserve that.

1177
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:26,123
# I wanna move less
over time...

1178
01:05:28,394 --> 01:05:30,997
Greta...

1179
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:33,032
I'm sorry.

1180
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:36,203
I can't.

1181
01:05:37,505 --> 01:05:40,041
I'm not gonna be here.

1182
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,944
Greta.

1183
01:05:42,946 --> 01:05:45,481
Come... come on.
Come on, don't do this.

1184
01:05:45,749 --> 01:05:48,952
Why are you acting
like you care about me?

1185
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:51,021
I do care.

1186
01:05:51,023 --> 01:05:52,989
I care so much.

1187
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:55,426
I just...

1188
01:05:55,428 --> 01:05:59,431
- I'm done.
- You're a hypocrite.

1189
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:01,600
I actually felt bad for you.

1190
01:06:01,868 --> 01:06:04,604
I thought you were just
some lonely guy.

1191
01:06:04,872 --> 01:06:09,476
Like I am and you didn't understand
that that's all it was, but...

1192
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:13,515
you have people
who care about you!

1193
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,552
You're not lonely,
you're empty!

1194
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,454
And that's worse!

1195
01:06:18,456 --> 01:06:21,959
# On fire, baby

1196
01:06:21,961 --> 01:06:25,330
# When you know
I want to make you feel

1197
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:26,931
# For me, babe

1198
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:29,401
# Feel for me, baby...

1199
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:34,174
You guys wanna hit the lake?

1200
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:36,576
It's hot as shit.

1201
01:06:36,578 --> 01:06:39,547
Then we gotta get in the car
and drive.

1202
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:41,349
It's too much of an effort.

1203
01:06:42,484 --> 01:06:44,119
What's the matter, Pete?

1204
01:06:44,121 --> 01:06:46,321
Heavy flow day?

1205
01:06:46,323 --> 01:06:50,360
I just want my entertainment
to involve a little less effort.

1206
01:06:50,362 --> 01:06:53,530
Defense! Defense!
Defense!

1207
01:06:53,532 --> 01:06:57,135
Ask and you shall receive.

1208
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:58,904
Who's up for a little fun?

1209
01:07:03,944 --> 01:07:05,445
Easy, Romeo.

1210
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:06,680
Your clothes are gonna be
waiting for you

1211
01:07:06,948 --> 01:07:08,982
on the roof of the school.

1212
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:10,418
Oh, yeah,
and all you gotta do

1213
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,186
is walk across the school
bare-ass,

1214
01:07:12,188 --> 01:07:14,590
climb up side the ladder
and get 'em.

1215
01:07:14,858 --> 01:07:16,592
You're taking off my fucking clothes
and I'm the one that's gay?

1216
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:17,993
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

1217
01:07:23,468 --> 01:07:24,669
Come on, dude,
get over here!

1218
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:26,570
He's as strong as 10 queers

1219
01:07:26,572 --> 01:07:28,407
or one really strong
11-year-old girl.

1220
01:07:28,409 --> 01:07:29,675
Zeke!

1221
01:07:29,943 --> 01:07:31,376
What the fuck you asking
his help for, man?

1222
01:07:31,378 --> 01:07:33,646
Quit being such a fucking pussy
and get over here.

1223
01:07:33,915 --> 01:07:37,718
Please? What the fuck is going on?
Why does he keep asking for you?

1224
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:50,233
'Cause this faggot's been after my
ass since fucking freshman year.

1225
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:52,069
Come on, Zeke,
don't do that.

1226
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:54,371
- Stop saying my fucking name!
- Whoa!

1227
01:07:54,373 --> 01:07:55,640
Hey!

1228
01:07:58,144 --> 01:07:59,411
Dude, that's enough.
That's enough!

1229
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:02,715
Get the fuck off me!
Motherfuck!

1230
01:08:02,983 --> 01:08:04,684
Stop it!
Stop!

1231
01:08:04,686 --> 01:08:06,319
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1232
01:08:23,174 --> 01:08:26,378
- Ah! - We're gonna
find your son, ma'am.

1233
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:34,220
- What's going on?
- Do you know where Zeke is?

1234
01:08:34,222 --> 01:08:36,323
Zeke?
No, why?

1235
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:39,126
He beat the shit out of some
black kid at school for no reason.

1236
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:41,462
Then he steals his friend's car
and we can't find him anywhere.

1237
01:08:41,464 --> 01:08:43,698
Romeo?

1238
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:46,668
Yeah, Romeo Simple.
How do you know his name?

1239
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:50,740
Romeo is Zeke's boyfriend.

1240
01:08:50,742 --> 01:08:53,677
What?

1241
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:58,383
Are you saying
my Zeke and this...

1242
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:00,152
He told me.

1243
01:09:00,154 --> 01:09:01,753
He has...

1244
01:09:02,021 --> 01:09:04,724
drawings of penises in a bowl.

1245
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:08,295
- Don't!
- Don't you talk about my son!

1246
01:09:14,704 --> 01:09:16,672
Whoa, whoa!
Everybody stand back.

1247
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:18,441
This is a family matter.

1248
01:09:18,443 --> 01:09:20,844
Oh, that's a nice shot,
little brother.

1249
01:09:21,112 --> 01:09:22,846
Hit a man
when his back is turned.

1250
01:09:23,114 --> 01:09:25,650
I bet you can't do that
when I'm facing you.

1251
01:09:34,395 --> 01:09:38,466
Oh, look, look! Here's a bowl
of dicks for you to draw!

1252
01:09:38,468 --> 01:09:39,800
Here, take it.

1253
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:41,669
Yeah, eat it!

1254
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:43,238
Suck it!

1255
01:09:47,277 --> 01:09:48,678
Huh?
Huh?

1256
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,480
Get off me, you dumb shit!

1257
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:51,782
You don't call,
you don't write,

1258
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,650
and your bitch-ass leaves
and all of a sudden it's,

1259
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:55,886
"Hey, big brother,
can I come stay at your house

1260
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:57,522
while I fuck some fatties?"

1261
01:09:57,524 --> 01:09:58,756
Huh?!

1262
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:03,729
You're tickling me.
Stop tickling.

1263
01:10:03,731 --> 01:10:07,267
Maybe I'd come back more
if you weren't such an asshole.

1264
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,802
Ah!
Fuck!

1265
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,571
You're both assholes.

1266
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,209
Teddy's right.

1267
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,716
It was a year ago, it was late.
I saw Zeke kiss a boy.

1268
01:10:19,718 --> 01:10:21,651
He was black.

1269
01:10:23,421 --> 01:10:24,922
I'm afraid he might
hurt himself.

1270
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:28,360
This is such bullshit!

1271
01:10:28,362 --> 01:10:30,262
I think I know how to find him.

1272
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:39,606
- Excuse me, Romeo?
- It's okay, Mama.

1273
01:10:39,608 --> 01:10:41,242
I don't care who
his brother is.

1274
01:10:41,244 --> 01:10:42,577
I'm gonna ground
that son of a bitch

1275
01:10:42,579 --> 01:10:45,547
till there ain't nothing left of
him but teeth and eyeballs.

1276
01:10:45,549 --> 01:10:49,818
I'm Ted Morgan.
This is my sister-in-law, Kathleen.

1277
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,688
Are you okay?

1278
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,890
A fractured jaw, a busted lip,

1279
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:55,760
and he's laying up here
in a hospital bed.

1280
01:10:55,762 --> 01:10:56,961
Oh, he's dandy.

1281
01:10:57,229 --> 01:11:00,432
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:11:00,434 --> 01:11:01,900
Don't worry,
I'm not pressing charges,

1283
01:11:02,168 --> 01:11:03,502
so, please, just go.

1284
01:11:03,504 --> 01:11:05,505
Romeo, Zeke is missing.

1285
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:07,674
He stole a car.
Nobody can find him.

1286
01:11:07,676 --> 01:11:09,443
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

1287
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:12,513
- Mama, get my pants.
- You're not getting out of that bed.

1288
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:14,816
- Mama, get my pants!
- Mm-mm, did you hear what I said?

1289
01:11:14,818 --> 01:11:15,884
Mama, you're more
than welcome to come.

1290
01:11:15,886 --> 01:11:19,522
- but I'm going.
- You know how I feel

1291
01:11:19,524 --> 01:11:21,457
- about "The Color Purple. "
- I'm going!

1292
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:23,794
I think I know where he is.

1293
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:26,664
- Get my pants, Mama.
- I'm getting 'em.

1294
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:31,370
What?

1295
01:11:35,943 --> 01:11:38,878
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he did it.

1296
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:42,583
No.

1297
01:11:42,585 --> 01:11:45,420
No, no.
He went through with it.

1298
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:47,356
Did he do it?
Did he do it?

1299
01:11:47,358 --> 01:11:48,758
Sorry, ma'am,
you gotta stay back.

1300
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,627
He did it, didn't he?
He killed himself.

1301
01:11:50,629 --> 01:11:52,762
We don't know that, ma'am.
We're trying to locate him.

1302
01:11:52,764 --> 01:11:56,533
- Why do you think he killed himself?
- Because he told me he was going to.

1303
01:11:56,535 --> 01:11:58,970
- Zeke told you this? When?
- Zeke? No, Ted!

1304
01:11:59,238 --> 01:12:02,007
Ted told me that he was going
to commit suicide.

1305
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,943
Chief, they found the car.

1306
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,012
Zeke's not there, though.

1307
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,415
- Show me.
- Let's go!

1308
01:12:08,417 --> 01:12:09,650
Wha...

1309
01:12:09,652 --> 01:12:11,586
It's right up here.

1310
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:13,721
Ooh, child,
I ain't got on the right shoes.

1311
01:12:13,723 --> 01:12:15,556
This is a mess out here.

1312
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,427
Why would y'all be
in all of this mess?

1313
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:19,728
How'd you know
he'd come here?

1314
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,898
It's his favorite place.

1315
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,002
He likes to come here
when he wants to be alone.

1316
01:12:25,004 --> 01:12:26,804
It's called "World's End. "

1317
01:12:26,806 --> 01:12:29,006
He said it's the most
beautiful place ever.

1318
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:30,609
You just gotta believe
in the Lord

1319
01:12:30,611 --> 01:12:33,512
and know that everything's
gonna turn out right.

1320
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:35,581
Do you think that God
hates homosexuals?

1321
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,986
Not my God.
My God loves everybody.

1322
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,588
Yeah? What if you get to heaven
and you find out He doesn't?

1323
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:42,824
Then I'm in the wrong place,

1324
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,893
'cause if He don't want my son,
He don't want me.

1325
01:12:44,895 --> 01:12:47,897
And I will give Him what for
and skip off down to hell.

1326
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:51,600
Be nice to see
my daddy again anyway.

1327
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:53,904
Hang on a minute!

1328
01:12:53,906 --> 01:12:56,107
- Zeke!
- Don't... don't... don't... don't!

1329
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:58,576
Stay back!

1330
01:12:58,578 --> 01:13:00,044
Zeke...

1331
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:03,048
Romeo.

1332
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:07,887
I'm so sorry.
You okay?

1333
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:09,924
Now that's up to you.

1334
01:13:14,597 --> 01:13:17,999
I can't... I can't be queer.

1335
01:13:20,404 --> 01:13:23,072
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Zeke.

1336
01:13:23,341 --> 01:13:25,109
We love you.
We don't care that you're gay.

1337
01:13:25,377 --> 01:13:26,944
Dad does.

1338
01:13:26,946 --> 01:13:30,048
Okay?
My friends do.

1339
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,819
I do.

1340
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:36,790
I've been where you are, Zeke.

1341
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,160
I am where you are.

1342
01:13:40,428 --> 01:13:41,963
You're gay, too?

1343
01:13:41,965 --> 01:13:44,098
No.
No.

1344
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,701
I...

1345
01:13:47,737 --> 01:13:51,574
I came here to do exactly what
you're thinking of doing right now.

1346
01:13:51,576 --> 01:13:53,910
I'm 41 years old,
I manage a pet store,

1347
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:56,814
no wife, no kids.

1348
01:13:56,816 --> 01:13:59,151
- No anything.
- That's not the same.

1349
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:00,952
Zeke!

1350
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:03,656
You're right,
it's not the same.

1351
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:05,124
You know who you are,

1352
01:14:05,392 --> 01:14:06,859
you just can't get
your head around it yet.

1353
01:14:06,861 --> 01:14:09,997
Me?
I don't have a clue.

1354
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:12,734
- Fucking jump.
- What?

1355
01:14:12,736 --> 01:14:14,135
Go ahead.

1356
01:14:14,137 --> 01:14:16,805
Go ahead, fag, just jump.

1357
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:20,075
I've never met two whinier
bitches in my entire life.

1358
01:14:20,077 --> 01:14:23,213
"I manage a pet store. "
"I'm queer. "

1359
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:26,617
Who fucking cares?

1360
01:14:26,619 --> 01:14:28,219
I'm black, I'm gay.

1361
01:14:29,555 --> 01:14:31,123
My mom's got
a fucking drinking problem.

1362
01:14:31,125 --> 01:14:33,091
Had.
Had a drinking problem.

1363
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:34,760
I've been sober
for two months.

1364
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,030
I got my chip here somewhere.

1365
01:14:37,032 --> 01:14:38,765
I haven't seen my dad
since I was eight,

1366
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:40,901
and my fucking name
is Romeo.

1367
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:43,938
And I'm still more grateful
than y'all bitches.

1368
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,842
You're gay, Zeke.

1369
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,644
And I love you.

1370
01:14:48,646 --> 01:14:51,080
I love you.

1371
01:14:51,082 --> 01:14:52,982
So choosing a life of love

1372
01:14:52,984 --> 01:14:55,252
from the people
that actually fucking matter

1373
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,491
and be an artist because
you're actually talented...

1374
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,928
if that's unbearable to you,
then you should jump.

1375
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:04,797
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.
- Jump.

1376
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,098
All right.
Okay, okay.

1377
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,035
Enough trying to convince
two people to kill themselves.

1378
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:12,807
Zeke, it's your dad.

1379
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:16,211
- I'm gay, Dad, not blind.
- Right.

1380
01:15:16,213 --> 01:15:19,181
You're my son and I love you.

1381
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:24,955
I admit I'm not too crazy
about you liking men's penises,

1382
01:15:24,957 --> 01:15:26,924
but it's not a deal breaker.

1383
01:15:26,926 --> 01:15:30,695
Just 'cause I don't need
a drawing of a bowl full of 'em

1384
01:15:30,697 --> 01:15:31,997
hanging on my office wall...

1385
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:34,033
Luck, stay on track.

1386
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:36,202
Right.

1387
01:15:36,204 --> 01:15:39,139
Oh, no, no, no, son,
don't, please.

1388
01:15:39,141 --> 01:15:40,974
Please.

1389
01:15:40,976 --> 01:15:43,845
I can't live like this, Dad.

1390
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:50,119
Do you know how I got
my nickname?

1391
01:15:50,121 --> 01:15:51,788
What?

1392
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,924
My nickname, Lucky.

1393
01:15:53,926 --> 01:15:55,325
You know how I got it?

1394
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:59,330
From... from the miraculous catch you
made playing high school football?

1395
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:00,732
What are you talking about?

1396
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:03,335
That's what I told you,
but that's not...

1397
01:16:03,603 --> 01:16:05,037
that's not why.

1398
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:07,140
I got it 'cause I'm unlucky.

1399
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:09,042
I had no luck at all.

1400
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:11,345
Unlucky was just too long.

1401
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:14,115
We were learning about irony
in English class

1402
01:16:14,117 --> 01:16:15,884
and some smart-ass
shortened it.

1403
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:18,019
We lost that game

1404
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:20,756
'cause I fumbled
a couple of plays later.

1405
01:16:20,758 --> 01:16:24,294
Yeah. But, you know,
later when I got on the force

1406
01:16:24,562 --> 01:16:27,364
and I met your mother
and we had you and your brother,

1407
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:29,767
I started to think
that maybe...

1408
01:16:29,769 --> 01:16:31,369
my name wasn't so ironic.

1409
01:16:31,637 --> 01:16:33,739
What's your point?

1410
01:16:33,741 --> 01:16:36,175
When I was your age,
some shit happened to me, too.

1411
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:37,677
Happens to all of us.

1412
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,980
Doesn't mean you say "fuck it"
and kill yourself.

1413
01:16:39,982 --> 01:16:42,249
'Cause tomorrow's
totally different.

1414
01:16:42,251 --> 01:16:44,885
Shit's temporary, son.

1415
01:16:44,887 --> 01:16:48,790
I know I might not be the easiest
guy in the world to talk to.

1416
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:52,061
I'm not a monster.
I still love you.

1417
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:59,204
I love this asshole.
I love all of you.

1418
01:16:59,206 --> 01:17:01,906
Zeke.

1419
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:04,043
I'm sorry.

1420
01:17:04,045 --> 01:17:06,812
I know I haven't been
a very good mother.

1421
01:17:06,814 --> 01:17:10,117
I saw things,
I... I knew things,

1422
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:12,887
I just...
I don't know why I...

1423
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,889
You're a great mother,
Kathleen!

1424
01:17:14,891 --> 01:17:17,359
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

1425
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:19,028
And you're a good wife.

1426
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,370
You can get through this, Zeke.

1427
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:29,106
You have family
and friends that love you.

1428
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:30,441
Come on,
let's get you home.

1429
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:35,314
- Come on, honey.
- I don't know. I don't know.

1430
01:17:35,316 --> 01:17:37,183
- God, Zeke!
- Mom!

1431
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:38,351
Shit!

1432
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,054
- Zeke!
- Zeke!

1433
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:42,156
Oh, my God!

1434
01:17:44,093 --> 01:17:47,095
- Ted!
- Ted!

1435
01:17:56,141 --> 01:17:59,143
Hey!
I got ya!

1436
01:17:59,145 --> 01:18:01,279
Hold on to me!

1437
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:02,414
Where's Ted?

1438
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:04,883
- Where's Uncle Ted?
- Ted! Ted!

1439
01:18:04,885 --> 01:18:07,287
Teddy!
Teddy!

1440
01:18:25,277 --> 01:18:27,144
Pretty cool, huh?

1441
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:33,986
Dad?

1442
01:18:33,988 --> 01:18:35,221
Hi, Teddy.

1443
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:42,195
- Am I dead?
- No, no, no, you're...

1444
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:44,499
your brain is being deprived
of oxygen.

1445
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:48,070
So I'm about to die,
I just haven't done it yet?

1446
01:18:48,072 --> 01:18:51,006
Depends.
Is that what you want?

1447
01:18:53,477 --> 01:18:56,247
I guess

1448
01:18:56,249 --> 01:18:57,948
death seems...

1449
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:59,283
I don't know...

1450
01:18:59,285 --> 01:19:00,986
easier.

1451
01:19:00,988 --> 01:19:04,089
Not gonna lie to you,
death's got its perks,

1452
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:05,958
but nothing beats livin'.

1453
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,960
Nothin'.

1454
01:19:07,962 --> 01:19:11,031
- Can I stay with you?
- No, not yet.

1455
01:19:11,033 --> 01:19:12,499
Someday.

1456
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:15,970
I'm afraid all the time, Daddy.

1457
01:19:15,972 --> 01:19:19,341
I know, but the trick
to beatin' fear...

1458
01:19:19,343 --> 01:19:22,978
is to live a life so full
there's no room for it.

1459
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,448
Fear thrives in emptiness, son.

1460
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:28,085
So just fill 'er up, Teddy.

1461
01:19:28,087 --> 01:19:29,520
I know you can do it.

1462
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:34,359
Bye, Teddy bear.

1463
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:40,574
- Is my baby brother okay?
- All right, just stand back, Chief.

1464
01:20:40,576 --> 01:20:43,577
Zeke.

1465
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:46,648
- There's no pulse.
- Ah, come on, Ted!

1466
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:50,286
Oh, you took my daddy, you can't
take my little brother, too.

1467
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:51,553
Ted.

1468
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,424
Oh, God.
Can you hear me? Ted?

1469
01:20:54,426 --> 01:20:57,695
No, you can't leave.
You cannot leave.

1470
01:20:59,965 --> 01:21:02,434
I'm so sorry that I got
angry at you before.

1471
01:21:02,436 --> 01:21:04,569
I'm sorry that I
said those things.

1472
01:21:04,571 --> 01:21:06,305
The real reason that I
don't have a boyfriend

1473
01:21:06,307 --> 01:21:09,075
is that I don't... I don't trust
anyone to stick around

1474
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,679
and I can't take people
leaving me anymore,

1475
01:21:11,947 --> 01:21:14,515
so I need you to stay.

1476
01:21:14,517 --> 01:21:16,718
Please,
I need to think that

1477
01:21:16,986 --> 01:21:20,323
I'm worth somebody
sticking around for.

1478
01:21:24,128 --> 01:21:26,630
- Oh, Ted!
- Hey, Ted, it's me.

1479
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,334
Your brother, Luck.

1480
01:21:29,336 --> 01:21:31,336
I love you, man.
Say something.

1481
01:21:31,338 --> 01:21:34,740
I saw... Dad.

1482
01:21:36,943 --> 01:21:38,645
And Wammy.

1483
01:21:38,647 --> 01:21:40,246
Oh, my God!

1484
01:21:40,248 --> 01:21:42,683
He was under too long.
He's fucking retarded now!

1485
01:21:42,951 --> 01:21:45,453
Lucky, honey,
I'm sure he's just woozy is all.

1486
01:21:45,455 --> 01:21:47,289
Daddy...

1487
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,726
and Wammy.

1488
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:53,696
No, no,
that's full-on retard.

1489
01:21:53,698 --> 01:21:56,567
But it's okay!
I still love you, man.

1490
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:58,268
You're my baby brother.

1491
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:00,739
We're gonna get the best
retard specialist in the world.

1492
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:03,174
We'll probably have to build
some ramps or something.

1493
01:22:03,176 --> 01:22:04,576
But it's okay!
It's okay.

1494
01:22:04,578 --> 01:22:06,445
Nothing's too good
for my baby brother.

1495
01:22:06,447 --> 01:22:08,714
- Uh, Chief?
- Huh?

1496
01:22:08,982 --> 01:22:11,685
I find the word "retarded" offensive.
My sister's mentally challenged.

1497
01:22:11,953 --> 01:22:13,387
Oh, yeah, Kevin,

1498
01:22:13,389 --> 01:22:16,691
you're gonna turn this into a
dick measuring contest now?

1499
01:22:18,529 --> 01:22:21,263
I'm offended, Kevin.

1500
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:25,101
He didn't break
any bones either?

1501
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:26,803
It was the way
we hit the water.

1502
01:22:27,071 --> 01:22:28,806
It was a little more
than a 100-foot drop.

1503
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:31,542
I penciled, went right down
about 20 feet.

1504
01:22:31,544 --> 01:22:33,612
Popped right back up.
There he was.

1505
01:22:33,614 --> 01:22:34,780
You kinda...

1506
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:36,783
half penciled,
half belly flopped.

1507
01:22:37,051 --> 01:22:39,118
Knocked the wind
right outta you.

1508
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,389
But the fact that you got knocked
out probably saved your life.

1509
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,561
You were so very brave, Teddy.

1510
01:22:46,563 --> 01:22:50,633
Jumping in after Zeke
the way you did...

1511
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:53,335
and being
such a terrible swimmer

1512
01:22:53,337 --> 01:22:56,239
- and so afraid of heights.
- Yeah, I know.

1513
01:22:56,241 --> 01:22:59,744
You know, I never bragged much
about you two growing up,

1514
01:22:59,746 --> 01:23:00,845
but I want to do it now

1515
01:23:01,113 --> 01:23:06,685
because I am so very proud
of both of you.

1516
01:23:06,687 --> 01:23:09,189
So proud of you.

1517
01:23:09,191 --> 01:23:10,323
Thanks, Mom.

1518
01:23:10,325 --> 01:23:13,194
Okay, Teddy, we gotta go.

1519
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:15,296
I gotta go see
the hospital psychologist.

1520
01:23:15,298 --> 01:23:16,797
Sensitivity training,

1521
01:23:16,799 --> 01:23:18,733
dealing with Zeke's,
you know...

1522
01:23:20,748 --> 01:23:23,473
And I'll see you tomorrow
when you're discharged, okay?

1523
01:23:24,724 --> 01:23:27,644
- I love you, bro.
- Love you, too, Luck.

1524
01:23:28,297 --> 01:23:31,483
- Come on, Mom.
- I'll be back.

1525
01:23:32,718 --> 01:23:34,352
Ted.

1526
01:23:39,737 --> 01:23:41,183
Hi.

1527
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:43,536
Hi.

1528
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,655
# The scenery's changin'

1529
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:51,525
# And it warms my soul...

1530
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:53,160
Thanks for staying.

1531
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:55,529
# I'm 200 miles down...

1532
01:23:56,121 --> 01:23:58,450
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

1533
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:03,370
# So get your boots on

1534
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:07,641
# And your walking coat

1535
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:10,110
# And we'll together
leave our footprints

1536
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:14,715
# Out upon the virgin snow...

1537
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:18,185
# That ancient sunrise

1538
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:22,356
# Will soon descend...
- Let's go.

1539
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:24,625
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
# And we'll be left here pondering

1540
01:24:24,627 --> 01:24:27,528
# On the things
which we can depend

1541
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:33,200
# So let's start over

1542
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:37,304
# With no means to an end

1543
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:39,339
# Just an openhearted hope

1544
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:42,743
# And a closed hand
full of friends

1545
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:50,517
# Yeah, well, London was all right,
but I was dead in the water

1546
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:54,488
# Couldn't see it in its light,
I couldn't kneel in its altar

1547
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:59,293
# All I wanted was to tear it
right down to the ground

1548
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:02,763
# But I'm feeling all right now

1549
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:07,634
# Yeah, I'm feeling all right

1550
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:14,875
# Every morning

1551
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:19,279
# When the coffee's on

1552
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,683
# And I rediscover
that color in your eyes

1553
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:26,386
# In its gold and its bronze

1554
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:29,656
# And in the moonlight

1555
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:32,826
# We'll get the candles going...

1556
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,497
Emerson said it best.

1557
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:39,399
"When it's darkest,
we can see the stars.

1558
01:25:39,401 --> 01:25:40,834
They're always there.

1559
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:44,250
You just gotta remember to tip
your head back and look up. "

1560
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,332
# I'll tell you why,
'cause I don't know why

1561
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,868
# But I can tell you
how it went

1562
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:17,638
# There's a time,
there was a point in time

1563
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,374
# When we just stopped
listening

1564
01:26:20,376 --> 01:26:22,876
# There's a ghost
and it haunts this town

1565
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:25,579
# Yeah, it haunts it
up and down

1566
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:28,415
# You're a mess,
yeah, you're a fucking mess

1567
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:30,951
# If you don't know that
by now

1568
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:33,554
# You don't
know that by now

1569
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:43,830
# Still in love with the turn
of your phrase

1570

# I don't want you to ask
how I am

1573
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:59,479
# I just wanted you
to tell me it's okay

1574
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:13,694
# You can fight,
but can you fight yourself?

1575
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:16,330
# 'Cause you're busy,
can't you see?

1576
01:27:16,332 --> 01:27:18,832
# If it's a heart
you've been looking for

1577
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:21,635
# Well, you won't get that
from me

1578
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:24,338
# You alone?
Because you look alone

1579
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:26,873
# 'Cause you're sitting
on your own

1580
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,543
# Are you alive?
Well, you look alive

1581
01:27:29,545 --> 01:27:32,412
# And will you just
pick up the phone?

1582
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,881

the phone?
