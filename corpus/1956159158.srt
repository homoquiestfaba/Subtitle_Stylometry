1
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:07,641
There was a time
I barely remember now

2
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:10,844
before all of... this.

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,880
I have to remind myself
what it was like then.

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,883
A time when I had a mother
I trusted, a sister I adored,

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,885
a life that was
familiar, safe.

6
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,621
And then time travel happened
and history changed.

7
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,456
You're Connor Mason.
Mr. Mason invented

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,958
a time machine
and chose not to tell
the government about it

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,327
until it was stolen
by terrorists.

10
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,430
Garcia Flynn, ex-NSA asset
in Eastern Europe.

11
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,031
If Flynn kills people
who aren't supposed to die,

12
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,233
history changes.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,501
Our earliest prototype.

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,868
We call this one the Lifeboat.

15
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,270
There's room in there
for three passengers.

16
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,038
To do what? Go after him?

17
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:39,573
Lucy Preston.
History, anthropology.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,609
You're world-class.
Master Sergeant Wyatt Logan.

19
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,910
Delta Force.
RUFUS: Rufus.

20
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,479
I'm a pilot.
You might want to hold on.

21
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,748
I thought history was
something worth protecting.

22
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,049
Worth dying for even,
no matter what.

23
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,484
Where's Amy?
Amy who?

24
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,919
Since we got back
from 1937,

25
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,087
my sister's gone.

26
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,155
Erased from history.

27
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,389
I didn't know
you were married.

28
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,457
Jessica died.
FLYNN: You were out

29
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,459
with Jessica in San Diego.

30
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,594
She ran into an old boyfriend

31
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,630
at the bar,
and you had a major fight.

32
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,232
She told you to stop the car.
She got out,

33
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,633
never came home that night.

34
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,668
They found her strangled
in the bushes.

35
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:08,836
You want this
telegram delivered

36
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,471
50 years from now?

37
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,641
Jessica, on Saturday,
February 11, 2012,

38
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,176
go home with Wyatt

39
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,844
even if he's being an ass.
I understand.

40
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,912
I would do anything
to get my sister back.

41
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,584
We can change history.

42
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,986
And somehow we can save
the people we love.

43
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,255
Jessica's alive.

44
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,290
You had been murdered.
In your reality.

45
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,159
Is there something
you're not telling me?
I'm pregnant.

46
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,527
I thought I knew
who the enemy was,
but I was wrong.

47
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,363
Stay the hell
away from her.

48
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,665
Oh, you mean Lucy?
You know she's not
your wife, right?

49
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,032
I know everything about you.

50
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,001
You want to know how I know?
LUCY: I didn't write that.

51
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,436
But you will. Ask them why

52
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,372
they really chose you
for this mission.

53
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,606
It was Rittenhouse.

54
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,441
Rittenhouse isn't a "him,"
it's a "they."

55
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,177
Rittenhouse changed
history and brought
Jessica back.

56
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,011
An organization that
wanted to control the past,

57
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,315
present and future.
And worse, my family
was part of it.

58
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,516
Well, I've got news for you,
my dear.

59
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,917
You're a part of it, too.

60
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,720
We will change history.
My name is Emma Whitmore.

61
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,489
I've always been loyal
to Rittenhouse.

62
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,723
Some of us
aren't royalty, princess.

63
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,124
Some of us had to work
our way up.

64
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:06,026
I thought
I'd lost everything,

65
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,362
so all that was left to do
was to fight.

66
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,698
Not for the past anymore,
but for our future.

67
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,901
Everyone's future.
Fight for each other.

68
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,102
It wasn't enough, though.

69
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,806
Rufus? Rufus!

70
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,742
And we lost
the only thing we had left.
Hope.

71
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,711
But this can't be
the end of our story.

72
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,679
We've come too far,
we've sacrificed too much.

73
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,548
There has to be a way
to get back what we lost.

74
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,082
To make things right
and save the people we love,

75
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,319
no matter what.

76
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,255
But it's all up to you now.
You have to change history.

77
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,567
Well, what are you waiting on?

78
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,904
You guys want
to get Rufus back, or what?

79
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,241
That's...

80
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,475
Us.

81
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:57,911
It's not possible.

82
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,582
Well, actually, it is.

83
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,251
Where are you from?

84
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,918
When are you from?

85
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,120
2023.
How are you even here?

86
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,223
In your own timelines...
The side effects...

87
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,091
We're not immune
to the effects.
We don't have much time.

88
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,226
I know.
Why would you

89
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,527
endanger yourselves
like this?

90
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,762
We didn't
have much of a choice.

91
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,029
We can't stop Rittenhouse
without Rufus.

92
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,765
Rittenhouse still exists?
In 2023?

93
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,099
JIYA: Wait.

94
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,801
You said we can get
Rufus back. How?

95
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,936
Everything you need,
it's in there.

96
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,073
Uh, my journal?
W-What are we supposed
to do with it?

97
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,441
Just figure it out together.

98
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,443
Together.
Yes, both of you.

99
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,212
What about the baby?
There is no baby.

100
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,047
Jessica lied to manipulate me.

101
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,149
Us.

102
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,988
Let's go.

103
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,890
Wait.
There's no time,
just focus on the journal.

104
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,759
Okay? Start with page...

105
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,495
What's wrong?
What's happening? Is she okay?

106
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,697
Or, am I okay?
Oh, God.

107
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,432
It's the side effects.
We got to go now.

108
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:55,002
Take our Lifeboat.
It's a lot easier to fly.
A few upgrades.

109
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,971
You guys can fly ours?
We've learned a lot
in the last five years.

110
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,172
What's wrong with her?

111
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,240
She'll be fine.

112
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,244
Merry Christmas, by the way.

113
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:33,273
'Tis the season.

114
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,580
To finish what we started.

115
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,550
Correct mistakes.

116
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,152
Create a better world.
But we're doing it my way now.

117
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,488
No more bloodlines
or any cult crap.

118
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,624
So if that's why you're here,
walk away right now.

119
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,432
For those of you
who choose to stay,

120
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,035
all I ask is loyalty.

121
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,303
What's the plan, boss?

122
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,206
You can
set up my office.

123
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,510
Big chair, mahogany desk.
You can handle that?

124
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,011
Right away.
Then, we're gonna do

125
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,913
what St. Nicholas
and Carol couldn't.

126
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,883
We're gonna take out Lucy
and her damn team
once and for all.

127
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,318
What can I do?
Mrs. Logan.

128
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,254
I have a job for you.

129
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,457
It's time to pay our last
sleeper agent a visit.

130
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,736
I'm so sorry, Wyatt.

131
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:39,407
How could anyone lie
about something like that?

132
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,274
It's Rittenhouse. It's how
they get what they want,

133
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,276
and they're
so good at it, too,
you don't realize it

134
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,612
until it's too late.

135
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,847
My mother was never the woman
I thought she was.

136
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,016
Now that she's gone,
it still hurts.

137
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,420
Are you okay?

138
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,087
Something tells me
Jessica wouldn't have been

139
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,789
the best mother, anyway.

140
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,194
Doesn't matter.

141
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,431
What matters
is getting Rufus back.

142
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,641
You want to do the honors?

143
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,623
What is all this?

144
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,059
Our history.

145
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,294
All of our missions.
It was, uh, my way

146
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,731
of keeping record
of all of it, I guess.

147
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,638
This thing is incredible.
It has advanced

148
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,608
reentry stabilization
and Tipler Cylinders.

149
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,009
Nice work, Jiya.

150
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,679
I'm guessing
you're the one who built it.

151
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,114
I might've made
a suggestion or two.

152
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,083
What are Lucy and Wyatt doing?
Reading the journal,

153
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,985
trying to figure out
where we take this new toy.

154
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,787
Okay, well, how long will
that take? Let's just go.

155
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,321
I mean, if we can go back
to our own timelines then...

156
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,124
Go back to our own timelines?
Are you overlooking the fact

157
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,026
that Future Lucy's head
nearly exploded?

158
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,262
For all we know,
that was their one
and only trip before she...

159
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,700
It wasn't the only trip.

160
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,470
She came to see me
in Sao Paulo
before all of this began.

161
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,838
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,940
Christmas Eve, 2014,

163
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,042
Lucy showed up
and handed me the journal.

164
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,878
The Lucy we just saw?
It was Lucy.

165
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,148
She traveled to a same time
she existed before.
It's possible.

166
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,983
But not without side effects,
it isn't,

167
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,519
and headaches
are just the beginning.

168
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,120
If you stay too long,
even just minutes,
there are

169
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,689
nosebleeds, seizures,
brain damage,

170
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,792
uh, memory loss, and then...

171
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,462
And then?
Well, everybody's tolerance
is different, but eventually,

172
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,132
insanity and death.

173
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,038
If Lucy and Wyatt are willing
to risk their lives for Rufus,

174
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,640
then so am I.
Jiya, no...

175
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,161
Lucy.

176
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,565
I never meant to hurt you.

177
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,768
I just wanted to do
the right thing.

178
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,170
I know. I know.

179
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,114
Hollywood, Salem...

180
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,685
...Titanic.

181
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,152
This hasn't happened yet.

182
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,461
You and Flynn.

183
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,864
Um...
All right,

184
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,033
I'm gonna let you
finish that one.

185
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,846
Hey, you find anything
in the journal yet?

186
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,248
We've found some... things,

187
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,651
but nothing about
Rufus, though, yet.

188
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,452
Okay, I can look at it
maybe then, and I can see...

189
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,788
Hey. They said me and Lucy.

190
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,790
There's got to be a reason.
If your future selves
are so brilliant,

191
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,425
then why didn't they
just tell us what to do?

192
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,497
Sorry, I'm just...
No, it's... it's okay.

193
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,514
What's this?

194
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,918
Rufus picked it up in 1981,
hid it behind SpaghettiOs

195
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,154
so you wouldn't find it
till Christmas, but...

196
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,189
I think he'd want you
to have it.

197
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,729
"Merry Christopher.
A little pun from '81."

198
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,732
Couldn't help himself,
could he?

199
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,400
Yeah.

200
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,104
Original issue packaging?

201
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,777
Rufus always told me there was
no puzzle you can't solve.

202
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,560
January 28,

203
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,630
1848, near Sacramento.

204
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,800
Lucy?

205
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,302
That's four days
after gold was discovered
at Sutter's Mill,

206
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,737
which instigated
the gold rush,

207
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:40,007
which basically
made California a-a state.

208
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,276
So Rittenhouse wants gold?
Shocker. A time travel robbery?

209
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,679
Let them have the gold.
Let them have California.

210
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,080
We need to focus
on getting Rufus back.

211
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,649
Listen,
when the Mothership jumps,
we chase it.

212
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,418
That's been protocol
since day one.

213
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,153
What is the point
of getting Rufus back

214
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,255
if we just let Rittenhouse
decimate history?

215
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,523
Are you joking?

216
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,591
Future Lucy said
we need Rufus
to stop Rittenhouse.

217
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,428
Yes.
Rufus trained you
to pilot the Lifeboat

218
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,196
for this very reason.

219
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,832
The world needs saving.

220
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,101
It's what Rufus would want.

221
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,438
We need to find and stop
their sleeper agent.

222
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:15,943
Whoa.

223
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,113
Hey. Is your arm okay?
It's fine.

224
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,415
You got a little bit
of something here.

225
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,417
Makeup can only cover so much.

226
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,620
Whoa.

227
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,389
This thing has autopilot.

228
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,025
What? As in,
anyone can fly it?

229
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,395
Apparently. You just plug in
the date and location.

230
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,766
I guess Future Me
built a DeLorean
out of the Lifeboat.

231
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,633
That's a joke
Rufus would've made.

232
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,102
I wish
he could see this.

233
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,804
He'll see it, Jiya.

234
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,972
I know he will.

235
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,517
You think
that's the sleeper?

236
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,651
No, I think
that's James Marshall.

237
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,387
Who's James Marshall?

238
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,122
He's the millwright
who discovered gold.

239
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,257
He's bringing it here
to show his boss, John Sutter.

240
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,658
Speak of the devil.

241
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,327
Looks like history's still
on course.

242
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,362
Come on.

243
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,734
I'd like to mine that gold.

244
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,269
Come back, say hi.

245
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,172
Has any woman ever
responded positively to that?

246
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,673
Just admiring the view, miss.

247
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,176
Oh.
We don't see
many women 'round here,

248
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,178
especially pretty ones.

249
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,748
First that redhead
and the blonde this morning.

250
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,918
And now these two.

251
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,020
What were these
other women here for?

252
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,354
Probably gold.

253
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,124
Rumor has it
someone found some
up by the mill.

254
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,658
You think she's here
to activate a sleeper?

255
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,527
Maybe we should talk
to Sutter first.

256
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,229
There's a reason
that Emma didn't go
straight to the mill.

257
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,399
Guys.

258
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,637
They weren't here for Sutter.

259
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,140
Okay.
Now, that's our cue

260
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,608
to steal some horses
and catch up with the sleeper

261
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,676
at Sutter's Mill.

262
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,147
We need to change.

263
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,849
Into what?

264
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,296
You're not fooling anyone
dressed like that.

265
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,331
General lack of females
in the vicinity,

266
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,734
two women on horseback
would've been flagged
a mile away.

267
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,572
All this time,

268
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,040
you knew what was
in the journal.

269
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,543
I told you
it can be unreliable.

270
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,613
I mean, with us.
Oh, so you finally got
to the good part, huh?

271
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,317
Must have been, uh, awkward.

272
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,252
Well? Was it everything
you imagined?

273
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,289
You were imagining it,
weren't you?

274
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,294
Why didn't you tell me that
we were going to be together?

275
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,330
Honestly?

276
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,866
I didn't really believe it.

277
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,702
I'm not exactly your type.

278
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,737
You don't know anything
about my type.

279
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:01,041
Also, I almost killed you
a few times, so there's that.

280
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:04,344
In the future,
I must have seen
a different side to you.

281
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,348
I guess I've already
started to.
Oh, then stop.

282
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,083
'Cause if you read
the rest of the journal,

283
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,686
that affair we have?
It ends badly, because...

284
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,658
...your heart always
belonged to someone else.

285
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,604
We have company.

286
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,417
Whoa.

287
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,656
You gringos stole my horses?

288
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,262
It's a lady.

289
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,569
You're Joaquin Murrieta?

290
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,903
Lady seems to know who I am.

291
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,740
Go ahead, tell your friends.

292
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,642
One of the most dangerous
bandits in California.

293
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,512
Your half brother was murdered
and your wife assaulted

294
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,282
after a dispute over a mule.
Then what?

295
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,617
Then you killed the men
who did it.
Not all of them.

296
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,320
I don't like when people mess
with what belongs to me.

297
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:21,588
Those horses are mine.

298
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,423
Our friend
was murdered, too.

299
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,993
We're just looking
for the people that did it.
Tragic story, I'm sure.

300
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,927
You know they hang people
for stealing horses?

301
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,497
Don't worry, I'll save you
the pain in the neck...

302
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,377
Really? They, uh,

303
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,313
hang people
for stealing stolen horses?

304
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,283
Because each
one of these horses

305
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,584
have a different brand
on them.

306
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,023
All right, look.
We can all start shooting

307
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,958
each other and see who wins,

308
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,328
but then we wouldn't
be able to tell you
where the gold is.

309
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,562
What do you know about gold?

310
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,830
We know where
there's plenty of it.

311
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,498
It's worth a lot more
than these horses.

312
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,866
We'll tell you
where it is

313
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,235
if you just put down your guns

314
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,470
and let us borrow these horses
a little while longer.

315
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,079
It's a deal, for now.

316
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,413
We ride until nightfall.

317
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:22,849
Vamos.

318
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,984
Hurry up.

319
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,686
Don't fall behind.

320
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,257
Must have been Tornado.

321
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,524
As in Zorro's horse, Tornado?

322
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,362
Zorro was real?
Joaquin Murrieta, he was

323
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,730
one of the Mexican outlaws
that inspired
the legend of Zorro.

324
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:40,433
Now you tell me.
Were you gonna ask
for his autograph?

325
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,569
I was a little focused
on the fact that he was trying

326
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,104
to kill us. Come on.

327
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,247
Where's Emma?

328
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,615
I'm her lieutenant now.

329
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,184
Come on. Show me the money.

330
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,789
I didn't sleep in the dirt
for three years here

331
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,391
to report to some underling.

332
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,726
How about we sort this out
with Emma in 2018?

333
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,830
How about you hand
the rest over?

334
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,936
Where the hell are you going?

335
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,072
You'll be picked up
when we say the time is right.

336
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,007
You can't just leave me here.

337
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,511
Pleasure doing business
with you.

338
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,582
Where did you get
that gun of yours?

339
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,018
Oh, it's, uh, Prussian.

340
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,221
But it's not
very powerful, though.

341
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,011
Well, I understand
how that feels.

342
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,846
I don't want
your sympathy, gringo.

343
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,383
You can't begin to understand.

344
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,887
My family was murdered, too,
by terrible people.

345
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,323
And?
And I tried it your way,

346
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,058
with violence,
but it didn't solve anything.

347
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,727
It just created

348
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,863
more pain.

349
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,199
But they deserve
to be punished.

350
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,833
Oh, they deserve
to be punished.

351
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,402
But it won't help your family.

352
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,604
Believe me, I tried.

353
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,138
Over and over.

354
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:04,010
You will just become
as bad as those men.

355
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,646
You have given up
your quest for revenge?

356
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,648
For what?

357
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:18,758
Ah.

358
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,563
I thought the legend
of Joaquin's family tragedy

359
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,400
was just some myth
from an 1854 dime novel.

360
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:29,402
I mean, if it's true,
he's about to go
on a murderous rampage

361
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,903
across the state
of California.

362
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,272
Can you blame him?

363
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,443
Wyatt? What is it?

364
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,812
It's Jessica.
What?

365
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,083
I keep rereading these pages,

366
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,486
and everything
leads to the same place.

367
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,558
Jessica is the reason
Rufus is dead.

368
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:55,862
Rittenhouse brought her back
to distract me or spy on us.

369
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,029
I don't really know.

370
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,266
But I played
right into their hands

371
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,967
when I brought her
into the bunker.

372
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,635
Jiya, she's the one
who kidnapped you,

373
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,437
she's the reason
we went to Chinatown.

374
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,273
There is a simple
equation here.

375
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,476
It has been here all along,
I just didn't want to see it.

376
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,112
It's the reason future version
of you gave me the journal.

377
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,514
So you're saying...

378
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,919
I'm saying because
Jessica lives, Rufus dies.

379
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,725
And to save Rufus,

380
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:29,296
Jessica has to be taken
out of the timeline somehow,

381
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,802
and I'm gonna be
the one to do it.

382
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,472
I will make sure
that Jessica never
steps foot in the bunker.

383
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,774
You mean,
go back to your own timeline?
No. No way.

384
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,109
It's too dangerous.
You could die.

385
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,411
It's the only way
to save Rufus.

386
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,578
How does it help us
to save Rufus

387
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,914
if it means sacrificing you?

388
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,583
Because Rufus didn't deserve
what happened to him.

389
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,255
You didn't deserve
what I did to you.

390
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,326
I let everybody down.

391
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,093
But I'm gonna make
things right.

392
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,295
Well, you're not
doing it alone.

393
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,663
I'm coming with you.

394
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,165
I am, too.
We'll get Rufus back together.

395
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,867
Well, it sounds
like a noble plan,

396
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,671
but if you all die
trying to save Rufus,

397
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,374
who will be left here to save
the world from Rittenhouse?

398
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,016
Take half of this
and store it.

399
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,786
Use the other half to fetch us
some sisters in arms.

400
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,789
What are you doing?

401
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,425
Santa's got one last chimney
to shimmy down.

402
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,828
But we don't have
any sleepers left.

403
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,297
Going back to 1950 Korea
to buy us one.

404
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,468
Need any help?
Oh, you just take care
of that gold.

405
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,202
I'll take care of the rest.

406
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,751
Wyatt. Where's Flynn?

407
00:21:58,818 --> 00:21:59,886
He rode ahead.

408
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,287
Said he wanted
to scout the mill.

409
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:05,558
What for?
He didn't say.

410
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,960
Get some rest.

411
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:47,934
JOAQUIN: Whoa.

412
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,737
Ha! Eureka.

413
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,506
So the rumors are true.

414
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,710
Where is your tall friend?
I thought he was
scouting for us.

415
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,446
That's a good question.

416
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,780
Tell him
he can keep the horses.

417
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:02,248
You are true to your word.

418
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,817
Unlike most americanos
I have met.

419
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,620
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some mining to do

420
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,922
before your people
destroy the land.

421
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,524
Uh, wait, uh...
Let him go.

422
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,127
We'll find the sleeper agent
on our own.

423
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,363
But what if we need backup?

424
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,469
Uh, Wyatt?

425
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:29,141
Hands up,
where we can see them.

426
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,679
You didn't tell us all
you were wanted.

427
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,917
Lock them up. It's payday.

428
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,628
I told you,
there's nothing to celebrate

429
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,329
until we have Rufus back.

430
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,098
I'm tired of making scarves.

431
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,367
I need something
to occupy myself while I try

432
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,837
to get my head
around the fact
that five years from now,

433
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,006
we're apparently
still chasing Rittenhouse.

434
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,308
Yes, that's because
we're going about this
the wrong way.

435
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,844
We need to save Rufus
to stop Rittenhouse.

436
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,045
Not the other way around.

437
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,314
I didn't want to send the team
on this mission.

438
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,349
If you want to blame somebody,
you should look in the mirror,

439
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,951
because you're the one who
created the damn time machine

440
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,285
for them in the first place.

441
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,621
You think I don't spend
every day wishing I could

442
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:15,955
take it all back?

443
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,530
I'm sorry, Connor.

444
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,635
We have to destroy them.

445
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,670
You know that, right?

446
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,839
The Mothership
and the Lifeboat.

447
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,607
We have to destroy them.

448
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,643
Can it be done?

449
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,911
Yeah, of course
we can do it, but...

450
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,048
Oppenheimer. After Hiroshima,

451
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:44,651
he realized
the terrible mistake
he'd made.

452
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,820
The "destroyer of worlds,"
he called himself.

453
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:52,024
And everyone agreed:
nuclear weapons,
terrible idea.

454
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,694
Six months later,
the Soviets had one.

455
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:56,829
The technology
already exists, Denise.

456
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,766
So some new Connor Mason

457
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,668
or Rufus Carlin
will one day create

458
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,970
their own time machine.

459
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,773
And we'll be without
a vessel to stop them.

460
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,508
What then?

461
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,422
They sent you
to protect her, too?

462
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,258
Who, Rittenhouse?
Yeah.

463
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,831
No.

464
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,234
You started this,
you know.

465
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,036
Of course.
It's always my fault.

466
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,438
Couldn't possibly have been
the drunk jerk
picking bar fights.

467
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,108
Please, Jess,
he wanted that fight.

468
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,610
You wanted that fight.

469
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,277
Yeah, that's right. Just keep
defending your boyfriend,

470
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,780
why don't you?
Oh, my God.

471
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,281
We were on a break,

472
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,651
and it was the best six months
of my life, by the way.

473
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,386
All right.

474
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:57,957
Who was that?
Is that him?

475
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,826
Let me see the phone.
Give me the phone!
No.

476
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,360
Stop it!

477
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,630
You know what? Pull over.

478
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,897
Pull... What are you...
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

479
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:06,532
I said pull over!
What are you talking about?

480
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:09,969
What are you doing?

481
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,638
Getting the hell
away from you.

482
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,741
Jessica, come on,
get back in the damn...

483
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,475
Fine, you want to walk? Walk.

484
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,981
Get in the car.
No. Drive away.

485
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,751
Get back in the damn car,
will you?

486
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,619
I'll walk!

487
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,621
Come on.
I'm sorry, all right?

488
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,256
Just get back in.
Leave me alone

489
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,592
before I call the cops
and get you busted for a DUI.

490
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,827
Fine. Fine.

491
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,112
Who the hell are you?

492
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,107
Never thought I'd say this,
but we could really use

493
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,010
our "tall friend"
right about now.
Yeah, where is he?

494
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,946
And Joaquin?
Mmm. Probably halfway

495
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,914
to Sonora
with a pound of gold.

496
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,249
What ends up
happening to him?

497
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,953
He gets killed in a shootout
in 1853 by California Rangers.

498
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,755
Mmm. It was never proven
it was him.

499
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:10,422
Historians disagree.
Oh, it was him.

500
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:13,525
I saw his pickled head
in a jar in Chinatown
in 1888.

501
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,127
Well, let's just find
a way out of here

502
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,763
before our heads get pickled.

503
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,935
Wait. What is that?

504
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,871
Sounds like Flynn

505
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,605
is really Flynning it up
out there. Flynn!

506
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,875
Flynn, it's us!
We're in here! Help us!

507
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:29,976
Yeah, it's about time!

508
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,482
Merry Christmas,
you filthy animals.

509
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:47,994
JIYA: Oh, my God.

510
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,162
Oh, my God, we saved you.

511
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,931
Uh, I'm pretty sure
I'm the one
that did the saving.

512
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,265
Oh. Um...

513
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,067
Let me at him.

514
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,468
Um...
Geez, leave you alone

515
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,304
for one second... Mmm.

516
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,775
I think I'm gonna have to let
you get captured more often.

517
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,711
Rufus... you were dead.

518
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,847
I... was... what?

519
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,581
You died in San Francisco.

520
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:13,019
1888. Emma shot you.
When was I in 1888?

521
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,686
It doesn't matter, okay?
You're alive now.

522
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,789
Yeah, very much so.
What?

523
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,191
How is that possible?
Flynn did it.

524
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,427
This mean I'm gonna have
to hug him, too?

525
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,529
Rufus!
Did you find your friends?

526
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,797
I need a hand over here!

527
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,498
BRB. Got to go help Zorro.

528
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,504
It's him.

529
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,141
Flynn must have taken
the Lifeboat and...

530
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,209
Taken Jessica
out of the timeline.

531
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,012
Rufus didn't die?
He went with us on this trip?

532
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,647
He's-he's been here all along?

533
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:44,750
And Jessica is... gone.

534
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,757
I guess this is
why you end up with Flynn.

535
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:55,094
I don't.

536
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:57,930
I...

537
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,199
I don't end up with him.

538
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,235
Let's go, you two.

539
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,405
Guys, come on.

540
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,222
You caught the sleeper?
Well,

541
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,024
it's not exactly
my first rodeo.

542
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,026
But Joaquin here
snagged those jerks.

543
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:30,930
Turns out the real Zorro
is much cooler
than Antonio Banderas.

544
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,665
Who needs a mask, anyway?
Take your share,

545
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,168
or I'll be tempted to spend it
all in one game of monte.

546
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:39,238
Where we're going,
we don't need gold.

547
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,240
But may we borrow your horses
one last time?

548
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,910
Take them. I can buy
all the horses I want.

549
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,377
Maybe even mustangs.

550
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,046
I can't wait
to show my wife.

551
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:49,215
Thank you. Thank you.

552
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,716
No problem.

553
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,084
Lucy.

554
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,254
What's wrong?

555
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,093
It's Flynn. He...

556
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,197
He wrote me a note.

557
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:12,238
My dear Lucy,
if you're reading this,

558
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,407
I guess I didn't make it back.

559
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,143
Well, maybe that's
for the best, when you think

560
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,411
about what I've done
in the past.

561
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,481
To the team. To you.

562
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,951
We both wanted to stop
Rittenhouse, but somehow

563
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,686
you didn't let it destroy you
the way I did.

564
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,656
So if anyone's expendable
on this team, it's me.

565
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,760
Tell Rufus
he can thank me later.

566
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,596
I have to admit,
I don't hate the guy.

567
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:40,566
I regret the pain
I caused you, Lucy.

568
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,800
And maybe by doing this,

569
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,770
I can find a small way
to make things right,

570
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,339
so you can have
the future you deserve.

571
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,341
I know with time,
you'll forgive Wyatt,

572
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,177
because you love him.

573
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,079
And deep down,
you know he was just trying

574
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,613
to do the right thing.

575
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:04,356
I hope you get
everything you want in life.

576
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,891
I hope you can be happy.

577
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,999
And one day,
I hope you get to have

578
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,700
a family of your own.

579
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,669
And I hope

580
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,438
you get your sister back.

581
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,708
There are some things
in the journal,

582
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,044
I never could figure them out.

583
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,146
But it's led us this far.

584
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,418
One good thing in my life,

585
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:36,455
the one thing that I couldn't
hate after I lost my family.

586
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:42,194
Never give up trying to save
the world from Rittenhouse,

587
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:46,298
and then maybe you
can save the ones you love.

588
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:47,566
Well,

589
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,103
guess I'll see you
Christmas Eve, 2014.

590
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,705
You know the place.

591
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,141
All my love...

592
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,343
Flynn.

593
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,378
So after
dispatching Jessica,

594
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:00,679
Flynn sent the Lifeboat back

595
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:04,283
to you in 1848
but stayed in 2012.

596
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:09,021
The, um...
time travel side effects

597
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,722
must have been too severe.
Or maybe he wanted

598
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,891
to go back and see his family
one more time.

599
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,893
Either way,
he's stuck in 2012.

600
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,065
Was. It took some searching,

601
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,934
but the body of a John Doe
was found in the dunes
by the ocean.

602
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,710
So Flynn died,

603
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,879
and you gave up
Jessica for me?

604
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,794
I'd like to propose a toast

605
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,028
to Flynn.

606
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,702
He had our backs.

607
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,571
Sacrificed his life
so that we could defeat
Rittenhouse together.

608
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,710
Let's not let him down.

609
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,278
We owe him that.

610
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,483
To Garcia.

611
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,532
Jessica?

612
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,467
Hello?

613
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,470
Jessica?

614
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,507
Where the hell is Jessica?

615
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,443
You mean Jan?

616
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,678
No, I don't mean Jan.

617
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,280
Tell me where Jessica is.

618
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:42,514
Who is Jessica?

619
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,450
Jessica Logan.

620
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,651
Wyatt's wife.

621
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:46,852
I don't know who that is.

622
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,356
They must have changed
something.

623
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,658
Eliminated her
from the timeline.

624
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,261
Changed history.
That's our job.

625
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,670
What do you
think they...
Get the Mothership ready.

626
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,771
What for?

627
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,274
Hell.

628
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,148
Lieutenant Langford?
Husband to Charlotte,

629
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:18,284
father of Margaret, age six?

630
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,918
Who are you?
I represent

631
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,920
a special kind of insurance.

632
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,490
Sorry, lady. Marines cover
everything I need.

633
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,492
Sure about that?
Because I can make sure

634
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:29,328
that your family
is very well provided for.

635
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:31,830
Your daughter would get
the very best
medical attention,

636
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,699
and she's gonna need it.

637
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,401
How do you know
about Margaret?

638
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,702
Her polio?

639
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,238
I just know.

640
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,939
And I'd like to help.

641
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,542
All I ask in return
is one small

642
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:49,281
big... favor.

643
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:51,917
Joaquin Murrieta never became
a notorious killer

644
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,220
after striking rich
at Sutter's Mill.

645
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,423
He and his wife
moved to California
and started a family

646
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,425
and a successful horse ranch.

647
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,193
Kind of killed Zorro
in the crib.

648
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:05,597
Where'd you find that?

649
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,833
That was supposed to be
your Christmas present.

650
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,070
I'm sorry. You were...
Dead.

651
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,206
Yeah.
Yeah. Look at you,

652
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,242
eating Rubik's Cubes
for breakfast and upgrading

653
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,278
the Lifeboat
to DeLorean status.
Yeah, but I didn't do it.

654
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,281
Future Me did it.
Oh, well, Future You

655
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:25,016
sounds awesome.
Mmm. Mmm?

656
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,419
And really smart.

657
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,620
Mmm-hmm.

658
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,290
And I can't wait
to sleep with her, too.

659
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:38,964
What?

660
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,468
I'm pretty sure
you're not Harry Potter,

661
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,202
so what's with the scar?

662
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,405
Uh...

663
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,106
Chinatown.

664
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,411
From what at Chinatown?

665
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:55,080
You don't remember it,
but I-I lived there

666
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,949
for three years
in the 1880s, Rufus.

667
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,054
And it sucked being a woman
in that place.

668
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,891
Someone did that to you?

669
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,226
I got away from him.
Eventually.

670
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,128
Jiya, what happened?
I don't want to talk about it.

671
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,464
Jiya, you can talk to me
about anything.
No. I'm tired.

672
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm tired. I just,
I want to go to sleep.

673
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,858
Agent Christopher said
that this is, uh...

674
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:40,959
Our room.

675
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,661
Yeah.
I guess with,

676
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,364
uh, Jessica gone,
we were...

677
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:46,532
Together.

678
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,266
Yeah.

679
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,036
But I'm gonna sleep
on the couch, so...

680
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,371
No, you don't have to do that.

681
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:54,105
I mean, are you sure?
'Cause I don't mind.

682
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,942
Come on, Wyatt, it's fine.
There are... two beds.

683
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,176
Yeah.

684
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,349
It was

685
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,183
really nice what you

686
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,387
said about Flynn.
Yeah, well, I meant it.

687
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:09,688
I know you did.

688
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:13,892
You know, he lied to me about
the name of Jessica's killer.

689
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:16,828
'Cause when
you think about it,
it was him all along.

690
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,297
I spent all this time
trying to find the person

691
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,166
that ruined my life.
I never even
considered the fact

692
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,068
that he was actually trying
to save it.

693
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,743
Flynn told me
something else in his letter,

694
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,579
about Amy.
What's that?

695
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,584
He said there might be a way
that I could get Amy back,

696
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,819
but I can't figure it out.
Besides, Emma
already said that

697
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:41,887
there was no way I was ever

698
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,355
going to get my sister
back again, so...

699
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,823
If there's a way
to get her back,

700
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,358
we're gonna do it, Lucy.
Not with Rittenhouse

701
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:47,693
still out there.

702
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,028
You heard what Flynn said.
We have to stop them,

703
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,397
because if we don't, then...

704
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:54,299
We become those people
that paid us a visit.

705
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:58,036
I don't want that.

706
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,270
I don't want that for us.

707
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,706
We-we didn't look...

708
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:01,773
Happy?

709
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,409
Yeah.
Yeah.

710
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,910
I noticed that, too.

711
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,945
I don't want to live
in a world

712
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,681
where we're not
just Lucy and Wyatt.

713
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:10,782
But after everything
that's happened,

714
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,818
how can we un-know
what we know?

715
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,028
Mothership jumped

716
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,731
to December 24, 1950, in...

717
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:28,767
Oh, dear...
North Korea.

718
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:30,436
Well, that's the last day
of the Hungnam evacuations

719
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:32,303
in the Korean War.

720
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,139
It's just after
the Battle of Chosin.

721
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,974
"Frozen Chosin,"
my grandpa called it.

722
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,144
Said it was the coldest
he'd ever been in his life.

723
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,679
Is Rittenhouse trying
to eliminate you

724
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,981
from the timeline now
by taking out
your grandfather?

725
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,716
No. He was wounded
and sent home

726
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,752
before they started
evacuating on the 10th.

727
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,554
Why did they evacuate?

728
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,255
Well, the U.N. troops
were winning the war,

729
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,057
that is, until
the Chinese Communist army

730
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,125
descended upon them
and forced them to evacuate

731
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,628
to the Port of Hungnam.
It was the Dunkirk

732
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:57,829
of the Korean War.

733
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,831
Thousands
of Korean refugees showed up,

734
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,232
families just desperate
to evacuate.

735
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,701
Instead of
leaving them behind,

736
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,603
General Edward Almond,

737
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,304
he wanted to see
how many he could save.

738
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,973
But there was a cargo ship,

739
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,908
the USS Meredith Victory,
they were only
supposed to carry

740
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:13,178
about 60 people, but they
ended up leaving with 14,000.

741
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,013
And nobody died?
Not one. In fact,
there were five babies

742
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,583
born on board. They called it
"The Miracle of Christmas."

743
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,785
Why would Emma
go after refugees?

744
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,787
'Cause she's
the ultimate Grinch.
We'll stop her

745
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,422
and be home for Christmas.
Bundle up.

746
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,592
It's gonna be cold.
Come on.

747
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,329
I'm coming with you.
You don't have to go.

748
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,198
I'm not losing you again.

749
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:41,039
Did you have to park
the Lifeboat so far away?

750
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,373
Well, we don't want
Communist troops

751
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,375
to come dashing
through the snow to find it.

752
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,711
Oh, God.

753
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,279
Let me see the map.
Here.

754
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,452
Port's a few miles south.
Okay.

755
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:58,590
So, who's on the boat
that's so important, anyway?

756
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,659
Uh...

757
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,795
The parents of future South
Korean president Moon Jae-in?

758
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:06,865
And Emma cares about that
because...?

759
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:08,734
We got to keep moving fast
to stay warm.

760
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,036
Why the Korean War?

761
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,904
I can't for the life of me
think of what Emma

762
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,205
could profit from
or need there.

763
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,942
Well, that's what scares me.
Emma may be a loose cannon,

764
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,910
but she is brilliant,
so there has got
to be a reason.

765
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,145
Mmm.
If our team

766
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,080
can't stop her in 1950,

767
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,315
then we need to catch her
in the present.
Yeah.

768
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,154
Bloody hell.

769
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:36,562
That can't be.

770
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,398
They're gonna die there?

771
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,409
Must have been a skirmish.

772
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,745
We just missed it.
Fine by me.

773
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,752
Is that a...?
Heliclockter. Copter.

774
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:03,254
Helicopter.
Must be taking
survivors to port.

775
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,693
Hey, everyone all right?

776
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,862
Yeah. We're good!

777
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,200
Come on.
I got the last chopper
going to Hungnam.

778
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,466
Wyatt?

779
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:14,668
Wyatt?

780
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:18,838
Wyatt?

781
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:21,141
Are you okay?

782
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,744
Emma set us up.
The pilot, he was
working for her.

783
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,647
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. He's dead.

784
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:29,849
We wrestled
the controls away from him.

785
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:33,520
Still crashed.
We would have died.

786
00:43:34,188 --> 00:43:35,222
You saved us.

787
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:38,492
Rufus and Jiya?

788
00:43:38,558 --> 00:43:40,060
They're okay.
They're okay.
They're okay.

789
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:44,431
Are you okay?
Yeah.

790
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,503
All right. Come on.
Okay. Ow!

791
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:07,387
Does it hurt?
No, the, uh, cold air,
it's very numbing.

792
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,795
Here, let me see.

793
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:20,800
When did you become G.I. Jane?

794
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,403
Chinatown. My friend
Molly taught me.

795
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,040
Doctors were expensive.

796
00:44:26,106 --> 00:44:27,474
Wonder what happened to her.

797
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:31,411
She died. Bubonic plague.
I looked it up.

798
00:44:31,478 --> 00:44:32,746
According to
the chopper radio,

799
00:44:32,812 --> 00:44:34,348
Meredith Victory
sailed yesterday.

800
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:37,717
With 14,000 people,
just like she was
supposed to.

801
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:40,720
So the pilot, North Korea,
all of it was about
her killing us.

802
00:44:40,787 --> 00:44:43,723
It makes sense.
Emma wants to get us
out of the way.

803
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,559
Well, it doesn't get
much more out of the way

804
00:44:45,625 --> 00:44:47,894
than North Korea
in the dead of night.

805
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:49,429
Sleeper's dead.

806
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:51,265
Only thing left to do is find
the Lifeboat and go home.

807
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:52,832
Anyone have
a one-horse open sleigh?

808
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:56,903
Come on, it's gonna
be light soon.

809
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,539
This is officially the worst
Christmas vacation ever.

810
00:44:59,606 --> 00:45:01,475
And that includes
the Chevy Chase movie.

811
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,679
The protocol.
They might have
left us a message.

812
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,147
Buried...
Sure.

813
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:09,683
We'll just go dig up a hole
in the middle of North Korea.

814
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,451
So, what,
would you have us
just do nothing?

815
00:45:11,518 --> 00:45:12,886
Just accept that
they're all gone?

816
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:14,321
I can't.
I won't accept that.

817
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:17,524
I'm not accepting anything.
I'm saying we need
a better plan.

818
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:19,459
From what I found,

819
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:22,262
it looks like they
were in a helicopter
crash on the 24th.

820
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:25,132
Yeah. Emma's doing.
They survived,
the pilot didn't.

821
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,802
Thanks to our intrepid team,
no doubt. What exactly
happens on the 25th?

822
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:32,506
They are killed by
Chinese troops in the
massacre of Usang-Ri.

823
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,412
We've gotta get to them
before that happens.

824
00:45:38,478 --> 00:45:41,315
Uh, how? We don't have
a time machine or a pilot.

825
00:45:42,316 --> 00:45:43,617
Rittenhouse has both.

826
00:45:43,683 --> 00:45:45,485
Yes, and I'm sure Emma
would be delighted to help us

827
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:47,154
if she wasn't the one
trying to bloody kill us all.

828
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:50,157
So, this is weird.

829
00:45:50,224 --> 00:45:52,259
In my timeline,
you guys are still a couple.

830
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:53,693
You think you'll get back
together or what?

831
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,895
Because I'm still totally
shipping Team Wyatt.

832
00:45:56,496 --> 00:45:58,498
What? What's that?

833
00:45:58,565 --> 00:46:02,169
You guys are
like Han and Leia.
Uh, Arwen and Aragorn.

834
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:05,405
Bella and Edward?

835
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,706
You guys have
obstacles, too.

836
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,976
Rufus, it's not like
we got into a fight.

837
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:13,313
He was married,
to someone else
who he thought was dead.

838
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,948
Who then,
all of a sudden,
wasn't dead.

839
00:46:15,014 --> 00:46:17,584
So he left me
to be with her.

840
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,386
And I know that you don't
remember that,

841
00:46:19,453 --> 00:46:21,255
but it's not something
I'm going to forget.

842
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:24,057
Well, apparently I came back
from the dead, so anything's
possible.

843
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:27,827
I hear that,
but I don't want to be
anyone's second choice.

844
00:46:27,894 --> 00:46:31,831
When you were kidnapped
by your mother,
we thought you were dead.

845
00:46:31,898 --> 00:46:34,501
We all lost hope.
Except for Wyatt.

846
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:37,171
He never gave up on you.
He always swore
you were out there.

847
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:40,974
He tried to blowtorch his way
out of the bunker to find you.

848
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,842
I know there
was a Jessica,

849
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,511
but he was willing
to give her up to find me.

850
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:46,112
And I'll tell you,
the guy likes me,

851
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,981
but if he had to
give you up,

852
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:50,083
I know for a fact
I'd still be dead.

853
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,886
Doesn't sound
like a second
choice to me.

854
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,121
Guys, look.

855
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,436
Where are they going?
Hungnam.

856
00:47:09,503 --> 00:47:11,070
The last boats have
to evacuate today

857
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:13,139
before the Chinese army
reaches the port.

858
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,974
Or what happens?

859
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:16,743
North Korea happens.

860
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,812
Anyone who spoke out
against communism or
tried to help the Americans

861
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,580
was, at best, imprisoned.

862
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:23,217
And at worst?
Beheaded.

863
00:47:23,283 --> 00:47:26,152
So, what about us?
We need
to keep moving.

864
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,556
Chinese just crossed
the border and they
march dark to dark.

865
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:31,691
We gotta get
to the Lifeboat
before nightfall.

866
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:33,560
Otherwise communists
get our time machine,

867
00:47:33,627 --> 00:47:35,862
which, incidentally,
is my least-favorite
Christmas movie.

868
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:37,631
I'm not worried
about the time machine.

869
00:47:37,697 --> 00:47:40,700
I'm worried about
the thousands of Chinese
troops between us and it.

870
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:42,202
So, what are you saying?

871
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:43,737
In all likelihood?

872
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,240
We die.

873
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,951
So, how long does
this war go on for?

874
00:47:58,017 --> 00:48:01,788
War lasts another three years,
till the armistice.

875
00:48:01,855 --> 00:48:04,691
But nobody wins.
North Korea shuts its doors.

876
00:48:04,758 --> 00:48:07,627
There are families who haven't
seen or heard from each other
in decades.

877
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:08,962
Hey, let's check
out that car.

878
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:11,030
Please, please,
be a car with a heater.

879
00:48:16,703 --> 00:48:18,171
Dead car.

880
00:48:18,238 --> 00:48:20,440
Well, not exactly sure
dead is a forever thing
with us.

881
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:22,376
Hey, with our
combined skill set,

882
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,378
how long you think it takes
before this is up and running?

883
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:28,482
Rufus, I...
It'll be safer, faster
and warmer with wheels.

884
00:48:28,548 --> 00:48:31,050
All right. Why don't
you and Jiya go get
warm in the church?

885
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,952
'Cause we're women
and it's 1950?

886
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:34,288
Because you're
starting to get frostbite.

887
00:48:34,354 --> 00:48:35,589
You look much
prettier with ears.

888
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:37,691
Good point. Let's go.

889
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,469
Sit there.

890
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:01,415
In San Francisco, in 1888,

891
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:06,820
there was this beautiful
cathedral, St. Mary's.

892
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:11,958
Rufus will probably think
I was crazy, but it made
me feel closer to him.

893
00:49:12,025 --> 00:49:15,495
I'm really happy for you,
for both of you. I mean,
just to have him back.

894
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:17,931
I love him.
I know you do.

895
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,666
So much, Lucy.

896
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:21,335
He loves you, too.

897
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,537
He thinks he does.

898
00:49:23,603 --> 00:49:25,839
But he has no idea
who I am now.

899
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:28,975
What he remembers
as yesterday was
three years ago for me.

900
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:30,243
And I've changed, Lucy.

901
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,912
I'm not the same person
he fell in love with.

902
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:36,916
I'm scared I never will be.

903
00:49:39,218 --> 00:49:40,520
Shh!

904
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:43,957
You need to be careful.
Informants are everywhere.

905
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:48,962
Sorry.

906
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:51,498
What are you doing here?

907
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:54,368
I thought they were
no Americans
left in the north.

908
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:58,204
We're... We're
war corespondents.

909
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,139
We got separated
from our unit.

910
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,409
I'm Rachel Maddow
and this...

911
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:05,879
I'm Lucy. This is Jiya.

912
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:23,029
I'm Young-Hee.
Hi.

913
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:25,932
Your English is very good.
I went to a missionary school.

914
00:50:25,999 --> 00:50:27,200
Oh.

915
00:50:27,266 --> 00:50:29,436
Are you evacuating?
No.

916
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,937
I came here to pray.

917
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:38,678
My husband, he's a journalist,
too, but he asked
too many questions.

918
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,580
They ordered him
to print lies.

919
00:50:40,647 --> 00:50:43,617
We heard they
were coming for him.
Did he go to Hungnam?

920
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:47,587
With my son, Tae-Woo.

921
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:50,457
I pray they are safe
on the boat.

922
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:54,794
What about you? What...
What are you going to do?

923
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:57,130
Wait until our army
pushes the Chinese back.

924
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:59,599
In a few days,
maybe this will all be over.

925
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:02,168
Then my husband and son
will come home.

926
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,314
I still can't believe Jessica
was alive, or that I was dead.

927
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:18,418
My memories are completely
different from yours
after Hollywood.

928
00:51:18,485 --> 00:51:19,719
You know what's crazy?

929
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,921
Yesterday, Jiya was
a year younger than me.

930
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:25,058
Now, she's two years older.
She looks pretty good
for her age.

931
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,893
Plus, I always had a thing
for older women.

932
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,094
Started in middle
school actually...

933
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:30,797
Rufus, I gotta
tell you something.

934
00:51:30,864 --> 00:51:33,332
Jiya being stuck
in Chinatown
for three years...

935
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,436
That was all my fault.

936
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:37,937
Jiya said
it was Jessica's fault...

937
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:41,407
Yeah, but it was my fault
for trusting Jessica.

938
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:45,912
Even when I knew things
didn't add up.
You even said so yourself.

939
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:50,016
And you told me that
you would never forgive me
for what happened to her.

940
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,554
Why are you telling me this?

941
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,392
Because I'd be lying
to you if I didn't.

942
00:52:13,873 --> 00:52:15,108
Hey, Wyatt.

943
00:52:16,242 --> 00:52:17,544
I forgive you.

944
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:26,886
That's not good.

945
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:28,054
Come on.

946
00:52:30,123 --> 00:52:31,257
Guys...

947
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:33,459
We gotta go.

948
00:52:33,527 --> 00:52:35,228
Couple of North Korean
soldiers headed our way.

949
00:52:35,294 --> 00:52:36,863
I'm pretty sure
they're not here
for midnight mass.

950
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:40,534
Wait, wait, wait!
We have to take her with us.

951
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,570
Is she important to history?
Everybody is important.

952
00:52:43,637 --> 00:52:45,171
Lucy, what do you
want me to do?

953
00:52:45,238 --> 00:52:46,339
We have to take
her to Hungnam.

954
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:47,774
She is super pregnant

955
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:50,109
and she put her life
on the line for us,
no questions asked.

956
00:52:50,176 --> 00:52:51,911
The Lifeboat
is ten miles north.

957
00:52:51,978 --> 00:52:55,414
The port is eight miles south.
We can't lose that much time.

958
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:57,116
She thinks that her husband
and son are coming home.

959
00:52:57,183 --> 00:52:59,052
Quick history in CliffsNotes,
nobody comes home.

960
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:01,921
Even if they survive,
she'll be separated
from her family forever.

961
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:04,591
I'm telling you, we're not
gonna make it to the Lifeboat
if we go to Hungnam.

962
00:53:04,658 --> 00:53:06,693
I wouldn't be here
if my parents didn't
get out of Lebanon.

963
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:10,196
I got a second chance.
Why shouldn't they?

964
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:12,532
What's the point of saving
history if we don't save
the people in it?

965
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,532
I think we lost them.
Is everybody all right?

966
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,568
Yeah.
Yeah.

967
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:52,038
We'll be lucky if
we make it through town,
much less to the port.

968
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:53,673
I... I can't go to the port.

969
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,776
I need to stay and wait
for my husband and son
to come home.

970
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:58,612
Young-Hee,
those men will find you.

971
00:53:58,678 --> 00:54:00,279
It's not safe for you
to stay here anymore.

972
00:54:00,346 --> 00:54:02,048
If you get on a boat,
then you can catch up
with your family.

973
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:03,583
You'll be together.

974
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,452
It's only a few days.
What if it's not?

975
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,127
What's that?
Huh?

976
00:54:14,193 --> 00:54:18,264
Oh, St. Christopher,
patron saint of travelers.

977
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:21,968
Found it at the church.
Thought we could use
a little extra luck.

978
00:54:22,035 --> 00:54:24,638
After everything
you've been through,
you still kept your faith.

979
00:54:24,704 --> 00:54:27,306
Rufus, you
came back to me.
How could I not?

980
00:54:29,008 --> 00:54:31,077
Merry Christmas to me.

981
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:39,686
Michael.

982
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,388
There you are.

983
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,124
I was wondering...

984
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:52,866
Mr. Cahill.

985
00:54:52,932 --> 00:54:55,635
I... I didn't know you'd
been released from prison.

986
00:54:55,702 --> 00:54:57,771
Rittenhouse always
finds a way, Emma.

987
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,406
How did you find us?

988
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:03,643
I know every Rittenhouse-owned
property on the West Coast.

989
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,144
Started with the estates

990
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:08,047
and took some time to work
my way down to this dump.

991
00:55:08,114 --> 00:55:11,885
We've had
some difficult times
in your absence.

992
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:16,389
The most powerful
secret society
the world has ever seen,

993
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:17,957
a family treasure,

994
00:55:19,392 --> 00:55:20,860
reduced to this.

995
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:25,098
That incredible machine used
so that you could, what?

996
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:27,266
Collect art?

997
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,169
I'm trying to replenish
Rittenhouse's assets...

998
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:34,640
Save it.
You're greedy and selfish.

999
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,009
I've been called worse.

1000
00:55:37,443 --> 00:55:38,912
I came to say goodbye.

1001
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,818
Just give me a reason, Emma.

1002
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,552
Thank you for your help,
Mr. Cahill.

1003
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:48,187
Couldn't have found
this place without you.

1004
00:55:48,254 --> 00:55:49,422
You sold us out?

1005
00:55:49,488 --> 00:55:50,589
I'm selfish, too.

1006
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:52,191
What did she promise you?

1007
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:54,861
The chance to save
my daughter's life.

1008
00:55:54,928 --> 00:55:56,329
Lucy still means
something to me.

1009
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,597
Plus protection and immunity
for my teenage son.

1010
00:55:58,664 --> 00:56:00,900
It's a family thing, Emma.

1011
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:05,538
Something you'll never
have or understand.

1012
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:12,478
How old is your son?

1013
00:56:13,112 --> 00:56:14,247
He's eight.

1014
00:56:14,313 --> 00:56:17,350
Does he like school?
Not as much as I do.

1015
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,718
I'm a teacher.

1016
00:56:18,785 --> 00:56:21,855
What do you teach?
History.

1017
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:26,259
It's hard now. The party wants
us to only teach propaganda.

1018
00:56:26,325 --> 00:56:27,727
"And the people
without knowledge

1019
00:56:27,794 --> 00:56:30,063
"of their past history,
origin and culture..."

1020
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:33,132
"Is like a tree
without roots."
Marcus Garvey.

1021
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:34,901
I used to be
a history teacher, too.

1022
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:43,042
You all right?
It happened earlier.

1023
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:44,443
I'm fine.
Okay.

1024
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,751
Come on!
Want to pop the hood again?

1025
00:56:51,818 --> 00:56:53,252
We're only
about a mile from port.

1026
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:54,954
I think we just need to
walk it the rest of the way.

1027
00:56:55,021 --> 00:56:56,622
Walk? In her condition?

1028
00:56:57,556 --> 00:56:58,892
Okay, okay.

1029
00:57:02,528 --> 00:57:03,529
Here.

1030
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,199
It's not too much farther.

1031
00:57:11,737 --> 00:57:13,306
Oh, God!

1032
00:57:13,372 --> 00:57:15,308
You're not okay.
Young-Hee, you're in labor!

1033
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:17,410
Should we get
her to the ambulance?
No, it's too late.

1034
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:18,444
Over here. Come on.

1035
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:21,014
Okay. Oh, my God.

1036
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,416
Set her right here.
Right here.
Oh, my God.

1037
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,185
Okay. Oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

1038
00:57:26,252 --> 00:57:27,586
All right, just breathe.

1039
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:30,824
Good job.
You've done this before?

1040
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,693
Remote village in Afghanistan.
Woman was in labor
for over 22 hours.

1041
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,429
Tried to get her to a hospital
but it was too late.

1042
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,831
Healthy baby girl.

1043
00:57:37,897 --> 00:57:39,132
So you know
what you're doing.

1044
00:57:39,198 --> 00:57:41,801
Well, nothing went
wrong that time.

1045
00:57:41,868 --> 00:57:44,403
Okay, well, there's...
There's a MASH
facility at the port.

1046
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,905
I can... I can
go find a doctor.

1047
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,141
Fine. Take Rufus with you.

1048
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:49,642
Okay.
Be careful, all right?

1049
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,444
They're shelling the perimeter
to keep the Chinese out.

1050
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,579
Come on, let's go.
You got this, Young-Hee.

1051
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,495
In just a few hours
they bomb this whole place?

1052
00:58:09,562 --> 00:58:11,464
Can't leave any supplies
behind for the enemy.

1053
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,066
But everyone makes
it out alive, right?

1054
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,668
Thanks to those two.

1055
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:17,403
It's Colonel Forney
and Dr. Hyun Bong-hak.

1056
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,405
They're the real heroes
behind this entire operation.

1057
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,407
Convinced General Almond not
to leave any refugees behind.

1058
00:58:21,474 --> 00:58:22,909
Colonel Forney, sir.

1059
00:58:22,976 --> 00:58:25,078
Ma'am, why haven't
you evacuated?
I'm a war correspondent.

1060
00:58:25,144 --> 00:58:26,880
Lucy Preston.
I work with Maggie Higgins.

1061
00:58:26,946 --> 00:58:29,015
We put Maggie
on a plane days ago.

1062
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:30,349
I know. We got separated.

1063
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:31,584
We need to get
you on a boat.

1064
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,686
Of course, of course.
But, uh, Private Carlin here,

1065
00:58:33,752 --> 00:58:35,688
he came across a refugee
who's gone into labor.

1066
00:58:35,754 --> 00:58:38,324
We need a nurse or a doctor
as soon as possible.

1067
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:40,326
MASH unit's jammed up
with injured patients.

1068
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:42,128
We need everyone we got...
Sir, please!

1069
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:45,364
Ma'am, I got to make sure
every one in this port
gets out safely, okay?

1070
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:47,200
Maybe you can find a midwife.

1071
00:58:48,467 --> 00:58:50,970
I'll take care
of this, Colonel.
Really?

1072
00:58:51,037 --> 00:58:54,207
Last boat departs
at 1400 hours.
Okay, let's go.

1073
00:58:55,341 --> 00:58:56,409
Come on, come on!

1074
00:58:58,144 --> 00:59:00,113
Jiya,
run back to the ambulance,
see if you can find supplies.

1075
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:01,847
Emergency blankets, towels,
first-aid kit, anything.

1076
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:03,950
Okay, but the doctor is...
No time to wait for a doctor.

1077
00:59:04,017 --> 00:59:05,284
This baby's coming now. Go.

1078
00:59:11,224 --> 00:59:12,591
Around that corner!

1079
00:59:12,658 --> 00:59:14,793
Up that hill
about a mile away!

1080
00:59:18,097 --> 00:59:19,165
Oh! Oh, my God!

1081
00:59:22,135 --> 00:59:23,669
Wyatt!
Jiya!

1082
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,842
Wyatt! Wyatt!

1083
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,645
Artillery fire.

1084
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:34,580
No. Oh, my God.

1085
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:36,782
Wyatt!

1086
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:38,551
Oh, my God.

1087
00:59:39,518 --> 00:59:40,853
That was close, huh?

1088
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,727
It's a girl.

1089
00:59:57,971 --> 00:59:59,805
Jiya! Jiya!

1090
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:03,977
Oh, my gosh.

1091
01:00:04,543 --> 01:00:05,611
Oh!

1092
01:00:07,346 --> 01:00:08,647
Wyatt delivered a baby?

1093
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:09,983
In the middle
of a war zone.

1094
01:00:10,049 --> 01:00:11,617
All right, wasn't a big deal.

1095
01:00:11,684 --> 01:00:14,687
What else don't
I know about you?

1096
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:18,091
Guys, we need to
get to the Lifeboat.
I'll try and find us a truck.

1097
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:20,126
We will make you
as comfortable as possible,

1098
01:00:20,193 --> 01:00:21,760
but we have to get
you on a boat soon.

1099
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:24,163
But how will I find
my husband and my son?

1100
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,099
There was no time
for record keeping.

1101
01:00:26,165 --> 01:00:28,134
You will see him
in Pusan, I think.
YOUNG-HEE: No.

1102
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:30,403
No, no, no, Young-Hee,
Young-Hee.
Wait, wait, wait.

1103
01:00:30,469 --> 01:00:31,670
Umma!

1104
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:33,872
Tae-Woo!

1105
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,688
I think
this little treasure
belongs to you.

1106
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,895
The boats
are leaving soon.
Thank you.

1107
01:00:56,962 --> 01:00:58,131
For everything.

1108
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,532
Of course, of course.

1109
01:00:59,598 --> 01:01:01,500
Good luck. Good luck.

1110
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,635
Okay.

1111
01:01:09,142 --> 01:01:11,177
Guys, problem.
We can't get a truck.

1112
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:12,578
Rufus, there's like
a million of them here.

1113
01:01:12,645 --> 01:01:13,979
They're all rigged
with explosives.

1114
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:16,215
They're gonna blow up
the minute the last boat
leaves port.

1115
01:01:16,282 --> 01:01:18,217
Anything with four wheels
is a bomb.

1116
01:01:23,656 --> 01:01:25,024
You okay?

1117
01:01:25,091 --> 01:01:27,360
I'm trying to have
a vision of a hot shower.
Leave me alone.

1118
01:01:27,426 --> 01:01:28,561
Cool, cool, cool.

1119
01:01:28,627 --> 01:01:30,629
What are the signs
of frostbite again?

1120
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:41,407
Who kills a nun?
Shh...

1121
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:45,711
Communists.

1122
01:01:46,845 --> 01:01:48,013
We're surrounded.

1123
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,150
We can't outrun them,
we can't fight them.

1124
01:01:51,217 --> 01:01:52,685
We need to hide. Come on.

1125
01:02:03,129 --> 01:02:04,763
Stop. They'll see us.

1126
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,532
What if they find us anyway?

1127
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,068
Well, I'll fire
as many rounds
as I have left.

1128
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:10,269
And then?

1129
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,037
Good talk.

1130
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:14,807
I just really don't
want to die. Again.

1131
01:02:14,873 --> 01:02:16,909
Would you stop it?
We're not gonna die, okay?

1132
01:02:16,975 --> 01:02:18,677
Not after everything
we've been through.

1133
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:21,447
Honestly,
I hope you're right.

1134
01:02:21,514 --> 01:02:24,950
I hope there is a God
and that he,
or she, saves us.

1135
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:29,122
You'd think he/she would save
the nun, though, right?

1136
01:02:31,056 --> 01:02:32,158
Just saying.

1137
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,163
See?

1138
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,497
You still laugh at my jokes.

1139
01:02:43,068 --> 01:02:45,804
I'm glad we're together.

1140
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:53,412
Look, Jiya, I know
things are different for you.

1141
01:02:53,912 --> 01:02:55,181
But...

1142
01:02:57,015 --> 01:02:58,317
We're still us.

1143
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,787
And for me,

1144
01:03:01,854 --> 01:03:05,691
there's no one else
I'd rather face a bloodthirsty
army of communists with.

1145
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,727
Me, too.

1146
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:26,412
What are you thinking about?

1147
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:33,952
Flynn.

1148
01:03:36,222 --> 01:03:40,793
The last thing that he said
to us before he left
to get in the Lifeboat

1149
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:45,130
was if we all run off
to save Rufus,
who will save the world?

1150
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:47,366
If we die tonight...
I'm not giving up yet.

1151
01:03:52,405 --> 01:03:53,972
I guess it's all
up to fate.

1152
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,611
What?

1153
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:01,614
Just you...

1154
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,251
Talking about fate.

1155
01:04:09,222 --> 01:04:11,390
So, you were right.

1156
01:04:11,457 --> 01:04:13,992
And here you had me convinced
that there was no such thing.

1157
01:04:15,728 --> 01:04:17,162
Timing is everything, right?

1158
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,609
After that explosion,
I thought you were dead.

1159
01:04:32,211 --> 01:04:37,350
And for a moment,
I saw my whole life
without you.

1160
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:41,220
And my world ended, Wyatt.

1161
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:43,589
I just kept thinking about

1162
01:04:43,656 --> 01:04:46,225
all this time
that we had wasted.

1163
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:48,160
Just wasted so much time,

1164
01:04:48,227 --> 01:04:51,196
and then, all of a sudden,
there you were.

1165
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:53,932
Holding a stranger's baby
that you had delivered.

1166
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:57,803
Then I knew.
You knew what?

1167
01:04:59,305 --> 01:05:01,540
I'd fallen in love with you.

1168
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:03,942
And nothing that happened
or didn't happen

1169
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:06,011
or might happen
was ever gonna change it.

1170
01:05:17,356 --> 01:05:19,592
I love you, Wyatt Logan.

1171
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:21,494
I've loved you
since the Alamo,

1172
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,797
since you kissed me
with Bonnie and Clyde,

1173
01:05:24,863 --> 01:05:26,732
since that night
in Hollywood.

1174
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,234
What happened after...

1175
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,272
I wanted to choose you.

1176
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:35,474
I just felt like
I owed her something.

1177
01:05:37,242 --> 01:05:38,411
I wish I could
take it all back.

1178
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:42,781
And the crazy part is,
Flynn already did.

1179
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:47,686
And now, all that we have
between us is a past
that only we remember.

1180
01:05:53,759 --> 01:05:55,027
So?

1181
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:59,432
I don't care
about the past anymore.

1182
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:01,066
And we might
not have a future.

1183
01:06:02,535 --> 01:06:04,337
Maybe all that matters
is right now.

1184
01:06:47,145 --> 01:06:49,648
Oh, my God!
I can't believe
you're here.

1185
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,755
I didn't want
to have to leave you here
to die on Christmas.

1186
01:06:56,822 --> 01:06:59,124
Plus, I wanted
to time travel
at least once.

1187
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:01,927
What, no hug?

1188
01:07:02,595 --> 01:07:03,696
What would Jesus do?

1189
01:07:03,762 --> 01:07:05,297
And you brought Scrooge.

1190
01:07:05,364 --> 01:07:07,666
Was it the Ghost
of Christmas Past or Future
that got her here?

1191
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:09,201
I think I liked you better
when you were dead.

1192
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:10,503
Sorry it didn't take.

1193
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:12,004
How'd you like time traveling?

1194
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:15,874
Not my choice of destinations,
but still quite the miracle.

1195
01:07:17,643 --> 01:07:18,777
Guys, it's just...

1196
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:21,146
Saint Christopher!

1197
01:07:23,181 --> 01:07:24,450
Agent Christopher...

1198
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,852
Oh, come on!

1199
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:29,822
Hey!

1200
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:31,590
Wait, wait!

1201
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:34,560
I can bring Amy back.

1202
01:07:37,129 --> 01:07:38,196
She's lying.

1203
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:39,965
Try me.

1204
01:07:49,374 --> 01:07:51,510
I only did it
'cause your mother
ordered me to.

1205
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:53,746
But I can undo it.

1206
01:07:53,812 --> 01:07:55,881
It means nothing to me
and everything to you.

1207
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:59,317
The truth is...

1208
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,155
I admire you, Lucy.

1209
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:06,224
We would make
one hell of a team.

1210
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,895
Screw the Rittenhouse agenda.
We could make history
whatever we want.

1211
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:17,169
I want all of this to be over.

1212
01:08:17,235 --> 01:08:19,572
And you want your sister back.

1213
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:23,909
I can make that happen.

1214
01:08:25,077 --> 01:08:26,512
You just have to trust me.

1215
01:08:36,755 --> 01:08:38,023
I don't.

1216
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,628
If she gets any closer
to that ship, shoot her.

1217
01:08:43,929 --> 01:08:45,263
Oh! Oh!

1218
01:08:46,865 --> 01:08:48,200
Everybody, get to the
Mothership!

1219
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:53,506
Come on!

1220
01:09:06,384 --> 01:09:08,453
Rufus is gonna get
the Mothership home, right?

1221
01:09:08,521 --> 01:09:10,889
Well, Rufus got us
to the Lifeboat, didn't he?

1222
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,528
Maybe our future selves
came back to save Rufus

1223
01:09:15,594 --> 01:09:16,895
so that he could save us all.

1224
01:09:16,962 --> 01:09:18,564
Yeah, or maybe...

1225
01:09:18,631 --> 01:09:19,732
Maybe what?

1226
01:09:22,735 --> 01:09:25,037
Maybe they wanted things
to turn out differently
for us than it did them.

1227
01:09:31,009 --> 01:09:33,846
You know what,
I think I can handle
this by now.

1228
01:09:33,912 --> 01:09:35,781
Well, it's no
problem at all,

1229
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:37,716
ma'am.

1230
01:09:37,783 --> 01:09:39,284
Don't you call me ma'am.

1231
01:09:42,054 --> 01:09:43,055
What?

1232
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:47,325
We can try to
get Amy back now.

1233
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,994
We have both
time machines.

1234
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:50,729
No.

1235
01:09:50,796 --> 01:09:52,330
Yeah, but the stuff
in the journal...
No, Wyatt.

1236
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,799
I've thought a lot about this.

1237
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,737
Look at all the awful things
that Flynn did

1238
01:09:58,804 --> 01:10:00,338
in the name
of saving his family.

1239
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,841
Look what happened
when you got Jessica back.

1240
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:06,411
I mean, I am so thankful
that we saved Rufus,

1241
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:09,447
but it cost us Flynn.

1242
01:10:09,514 --> 01:10:13,752
And if we're willing to use
this machine to get back
the things that we've lost,

1243
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:15,688
no matter the price,
I mean...

1244
01:10:15,754 --> 01:10:17,756
When will it end?

1245
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:19,625
We'd be no better
than my mother or Emma.

1246
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:31,837
You sure you're
okay with that?

1247
01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:33,839
Of course not.

1248
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:39,444
But everybody loses
someone that they love,

1249
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:42,047
and no matter how badly
they want to,
they can't get them back.

1250
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:50,055
And in spite of that,
they find a way to go on.

1251
01:10:53,491 --> 01:10:54,893
That's everyone's history.

1252
01:11:03,802 --> 01:11:05,938
All right. Well...

1253
01:11:06,004 --> 01:11:07,706
Jiya said auto-pilot, right?

1254
01:11:19,184 --> 01:11:20,285
All right.

1255
01:11:20,352 --> 01:11:22,921
Looks like we'll be home
for Christmas after all.

1256
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:45,343
We did it.
You did it.

1257
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:46,845
I knew I could do it.

1258
01:11:46,912 --> 01:11:50,182
You were scared
out of your mind.
I was mildly anxious.

1259
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:52,284
You did it anyway.
So much fun.

1260
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,719
You flew the Mothership!

1261
01:11:53,786 --> 01:11:56,855
Too bad it's being
destroyed as we speak.

1262
01:11:56,922 --> 01:11:58,390
Maybe we haven't
changed so much after all.

1263
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:01,860
I am so glad
to hear you say that.

1264
01:12:03,962 --> 01:12:05,597
So, what now?

1265
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:07,733
What now, what?

1266
01:12:10,435 --> 01:12:11,937
Well, we're gonna have
to get new jobs.

1267
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,039
I guess so.

1268
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:16,141
Yeah, can't exactly put
"time travel" on my resume.

1269
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,275
Mmm.

1270
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:21,246
You get to see
your family again.

1271
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:23,248
They think I died in the
explosion at Mason Industries.

1272
01:12:23,315 --> 01:12:25,383
I'm making more
comebacks than Elvis.

1273
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,152
You have practice.

1274
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:28,586
Guess I'll finally have
to get my own place.

1275
01:12:29,287 --> 01:12:30,555
I guess so.

1276
01:12:30,622 --> 01:12:32,557
Still it was a lot of fun
living together, right?

1277
01:12:32,624 --> 01:12:33,658
Eh, it had its moments.

1278
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,428
Gonna miss it, sort of.

1279
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,935
Is this your awkward way
of asking to move in with me?

1280
01:12:43,001 --> 01:12:44,502
Way to take a hint, lady.

1281
01:12:47,005 --> 01:12:48,473
So, is that a yes?

1282
01:12:51,844 --> 01:12:53,045
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

1283
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:55,013
Yeah. 
That's a yes, that's a yes.

1284
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,849
That's a yes. It'll work.

1285
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:00,953
Hey. Listen to this.
Yeah.

1286
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:05,758
Young-Hee died in 2007.
She lived well into her 80s.

1287
01:13:05,824 --> 01:13:08,560
Tae-Woo's a retired
investment banker
in Seoul.

1288
01:13:08,626 --> 01:13:12,130
Their daughter is a teacher,
just like their mother.

1289
01:13:12,197 --> 01:13:13,866
Two kids.
Wow.

1290
01:13:15,768 --> 01:13:18,737
Sounds like a crazy,
ordinary, wonderful life.

1291
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:19,972
Thanks to you.

1292
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:22,607
No.

1293
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:25,243
That was your call.

1294
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:27,079
You're the one who said
everyone's important.

1295
01:13:27,145 --> 01:13:28,380
Maybe not to history,

1296
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:30,548
but everybody is important
to someone, I think.

1297
01:13:31,817 --> 01:13:33,986
Careful.

1298
01:13:36,889 --> 01:13:38,523
How'd that get there?

1299
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,558
Apparently, Agent Christopher
has a dirtier mind
than we thought.

1300
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:45,663
I mean, it is a custom.
Mmm.

1301
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:46,899
All right?
Mmm!

1302
01:13:56,975 --> 01:13:58,844
That's the first time
we've done that
in the present.

1303
01:13:58,911 --> 01:14:01,914
I mean, our present.
I mean, 2018.

1304
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,181
Hmm.

1305
01:14:03,248 --> 01:14:05,583
Well, it's gonna
be 2019 soon.

1306
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,751
True.

1307
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:08,386
So maybe we should...

1308
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:10,923
Make up for lost time?

1309
01:14:31,576 --> 01:14:32,878
This one is for you.

1310
01:14:32,945 --> 01:14:34,379
Uh, okay.

1311
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:36,381
This one for you.
Thank you.

1312
01:14:36,448 --> 01:14:37,482
This one is for you.

1313
01:14:37,549 --> 01:14:39,084
Hmm!
Oh.

1314
01:14:39,151 --> 01:14:42,888
And there you go.
Wow. You shouldn't
have, really.

1315
01:14:42,955 --> 01:14:44,389
Really shouldn't have.

1316
01:14:44,456 --> 01:14:45,557
JIYA: It's the thought
that counts.

1317
01:14:45,623 --> 01:14:47,159
And the thought
was what exactly?

1318
01:14:47,225 --> 01:14:48,226
Hey!

1319
01:14:48,293 --> 01:14:49,361
Uh...

1320
01:14:49,427 --> 01:14:50,562
It's lovely.

1321
01:14:52,764 --> 01:14:54,099
Guys...

1322
01:14:55,467 --> 01:14:57,202
We did it.

1323
01:14:57,269 --> 01:15:00,272
We stopped Rittenhouse.

1324
01:15:01,006 --> 01:15:02,140
We won.

1325
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:06,211
Cheers.
RUFUS AND JIYA: Cheers.

1326
01:15:06,278 --> 01:15:07,379
Flynn would be proud.

1327
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:10,015
Yes, he would have.

1328
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,418
So, was this our
last morning together?

1329
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:15,253
You know, as a family?

1330
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,157
Yep. As of 0900 hours,
you are all free to go.

1331
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,359
Except for you.
The paperwork came through.

1332
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:24,396
You're officially assigned
to Special Projects with me.

1333
01:15:24,462 --> 01:15:25,797
No one I'd rather report to.

1334
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,605
You look bloody ridiculous.

1335
01:15:33,671 --> 01:15:36,508
My children compete to find me
the ugliest Christmas sweater.

1336
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:37,575
And Mark won.

1337
01:15:37,642 --> 01:15:39,077
I wear it with pride.

1338
01:15:39,144 --> 01:15:40,512
Well, at least take
that bloody thing
off your head.

1339
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,647
You look like some
sort of drunk elf.

1340
01:15:42,714 --> 01:15:44,917
You get a lump of coal
in your stocking or what?

1341
01:15:44,983 --> 01:15:46,851
No, just this.

1342
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:48,786
What's that?

1343
01:15:48,853 --> 01:15:51,023
All that's left
of the Mothership.

1344
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:53,725
I'm sorry, Connor.
Oh... Don't be.

1345
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:55,193
There's one thing I've learnt.

1346
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,762
A machine that powerful is too
dangerous in anyone's hands.

1347
01:15:57,829 --> 01:16:00,865
Now, I suppose, we need to
disassemble the Lifeboat.

1348
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:02,300
We're keeping the Lifeboat.

1349
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:06,604
A wise man once told me

1350
01:16:06,671 --> 01:16:10,108
that if it's possible
to build a time machine,
someone will build it,

1351
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:11,476
and we'll need
a way to stop them.

1352
01:16:11,543 --> 01:16:14,479
So the Lifeboat stays here,
under armed guard.

1353
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,267
Uh, Professor Preston?
Yeah.

1354
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,902
So, you're saying
that without Alice Paul,

1355
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,105
Grace Humiston is just
a detective in New York?

1356
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:41,639
That's right.

1357
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:43,942
How do you know?
Trust me, I know.

1358
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:45,610
Okay.
Okay.

1359
01:16:45,677 --> 01:16:47,312
Hey, have a happy holiday

1360
01:16:47,379 --> 01:16:48,913
and don't forget to review
the Harriet Tubman material,
all right?

1361
01:16:48,981 --> 01:16:50,082
Okay. Bye.
Okay. See you soon.

1362
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:51,916
Bye, Tegan. Yeah?
Hey.

1363
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:55,020
This was supposed
to be a regular
American History class.

1364
01:16:55,087 --> 01:16:56,554
How come we're
only studying women?

1365
01:16:56,621 --> 01:16:59,091
I meant to get to the men,
but we just didn't have time.

1366
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:02,027
Maybe in the spring, okay?
Merry Christmas.
Bye.

1367
01:17:04,362 --> 01:17:05,630
No, no, no!

1368
01:17:05,697 --> 01:17:06,764
Oh, God!

1369
01:17:09,201 --> 01:17:11,136
Give me, give me,
yeah, give me!

1370
01:17:11,203 --> 01:17:13,538
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1371
01:17:16,374 --> 01:17:18,176
Back to basic training for me.

1372
01:17:18,243 --> 01:17:19,511
Hello!

1373
01:17:19,577 --> 01:17:21,879
Mommy!

1374
01:17:21,946 --> 01:17:23,781
What are you torturing Daddy
with this time, huh?

1375
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:25,217
Boot camp.

1376
01:17:25,283 --> 01:17:27,219
Boot camp?
I hope you didn't
go too easy on him.

1377
01:17:34,059 --> 01:17:35,660
Guess what?
What?

1378
01:17:35,727 --> 01:17:36,794
I got tenure.

1379
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:46,471
I am so proud of you.
Thank you.

1380
01:17:50,408 --> 01:17:53,078
Flynn! Amy! You ready to go?

1381
01:17:53,578 --> 01:17:54,879
Come on.

1382
01:17:56,414 --> 01:17:58,750
Come over here.
Give me your hand. All right.

1383
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:00,818
You ready for this?

1384
01:18:01,519 --> 01:18:02,887
Ready as I'll ever be.

1385
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:09,494
We were hoping to get a better
facility, but funding was even
shorter than usual.

1386
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,030
We all started somewhere.

1387
01:18:12,097 --> 01:18:15,800
When Rufus and I started
Riya Industries, I wanted
to build a better future.

1388
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:17,569
Rufus,

1389
01:18:17,635 --> 01:18:19,771
all about giving back
to the community.

1390
01:18:19,837 --> 01:18:21,139
He was just
like these kids once.

1391
01:18:25,143 --> 01:18:28,080
It's called a Leyden jar,
and it was actually
the first capacitor.

1392
01:18:28,146 --> 01:18:32,016
Yeah, I've seen one
of these before, but
yours is definitely better.

1393
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:33,785
Hey, guys.

1394
01:18:33,851 --> 01:18:36,188
Could I
have your autograph?
Yeah, sure.

1395
01:18:38,823 --> 01:18:39,824
Thank you.

1396
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,496
How come nobody
asks for my autograph?

1397
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:46,464
'Cause you wanted to be
the mysterious one
behind the scenes.

1398
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:47,932
Ah.
Mmm.

1399
01:18:47,999 --> 01:18:49,367
You know,
I think it's about
time to, uh, do the...

1400
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:51,436
Rufus Carlin,
if anything happens to you...

1401
01:18:51,503 --> 01:18:54,239
Hey, I am the guy
that came back from the dead.

1402
01:18:54,306 --> 01:18:55,673
You're never gonna
stop saying that, are you?

1403
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,109
Yeah. No, why would I?

1404
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:06,618
The twins are
in their pajamas,

1405
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:08,120
and they are brushing
their teeth.

1406
01:19:08,186 --> 01:19:10,155
They're so excited
about their sleepover.

1407
01:19:10,222 --> 01:19:12,590
When I told them that Mommy
and Daddy used to live here,

1408
01:19:12,657 --> 01:19:14,226
they didn't believe me.

1409
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:16,594
That's because, like most
government-funded housing,

1410
01:19:16,661 --> 01:19:17,962
it's utterly uninhabitable
and always was.

1411
01:19:18,029 --> 01:19:20,498
Says the man
under federal
contract, right?

1412
01:19:20,565 --> 01:19:22,300
Well, it turns out

1413
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,037
I liked, uh, saving the world
more than I liked
saving money.

1414
01:19:26,104 --> 01:19:28,005
So, you ever miss
saving the world?

1415
01:19:29,207 --> 01:19:30,808
Sometimes.

1416
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:32,076
Then I think
about North Korea.

1417
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:33,411
French and Indian War.
The Murder Castle.

1418
01:19:33,478 --> 01:19:34,779
Al Capone
trying to kill us.

1419
01:19:34,846 --> 01:19:36,748
Benedict Arnold.
Confederate slave owners.

1420
01:19:38,015 --> 01:19:39,417
Nazis.
Nazis.

1421
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:41,753
Ready to do it one more time?

1422
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:44,756
We have to,
or all of this
could disappear.

1423
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:47,825
Hey, anybody need a pilot?

1424
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,362
No!

1425
01:19:52,096 --> 01:19:54,266
Hey!
Hi.

1426
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:56,334
You didn't tell me
he was coming.

1427
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:58,002
Think we'd let
you do it alone?

1428
01:19:58,069 --> 01:20:01,038
Yeah. Three of us started it,
so let's finish it.

1429
01:20:06,644 --> 01:20:08,413
Okay, but if
anything goes wrong...
It won't.

1430
01:20:09,247 --> 01:20:10,282
We get in and we get out.

1431
01:20:11,249 --> 01:20:12,550
We got this, Lucy.

1432
01:20:40,077 --> 01:20:41,145
Is this seat taken?

1433
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:42,814
Nao falo ingles.

1434
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:51,289
I know you speak
English, Flynn.

1435
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,927
Don't worry, I'm a friend.
I mean, I will be a friend.

1436
01:20:55,993 --> 01:20:57,562
What do you want?
I don't have a lot of time.

1437
01:20:57,629 --> 01:20:59,264
I know about Rittenhouse.

1438
01:20:59,331 --> 01:21:01,499
I know what they did
to your wife Lorena,
and your daughter Iris.

1439
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:02,834
Who are you?
Shh!

1440
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,101
My name is Lucy Preston.

1441
01:21:04,168 --> 01:21:05,537
I'm from the year 2023,

1442
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:08,273
and I know this is
going to sound crazy,

1443
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,375
but some day, you and I
are going to work together.

1444
01:21:10,442 --> 01:21:12,210
My God!

1445
01:21:12,277 --> 01:21:15,680
The time machine!
Connor Mason actually
built it? I knew it!

1446
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:17,249
You were right.
You were right
about everything.

1447
01:21:18,316 --> 01:21:19,817
More than you will ever know.

1448
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:21,686
But you...

1449
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:29,927
Okay, look...

1450
01:21:29,994 --> 01:21:32,864
You are going to
have to sacrifice
everything for a cause

1451
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,466
that almost no one
will believe in.

1452
01:21:34,532 --> 01:21:37,802
The world will think
that you're a terrorist
and a traitor.

1453
01:21:37,869 --> 01:21:39,304
Even I'm going to think
that at first, but...

1454
01:21:39,371 --> 01:21:41,306
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, listen to me.

1455
01:21:41,373 --> 01:21:43,140
But you aren't
any of those things.

1456
01:21:43,207 --> 01:21:46,110
And you're going to think
that you lost your humanity,
but you didn't.

1457
01:21:46,177 --> 01:21:47,445
And you never will.

1458
01:21:49,013 --> 01:21:50,181
What about my family?

1459
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,822
You won't
get them back. I'm sorry.

1460
01:22:01,025 --> 01:22:02,694
You're a hero, I promise.

1461
01:22:04,396 --> 01:22:05,697
Maybe the greatest
hero of us all.

1462
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,136
But you're going to need
my help, okay? So...

1463
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:15,907
You okay?

1464
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:21,078
Here, take this.

1465
01:22:22,347 --> 01:22:24,048
You are going to save history.

1466
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:06,724
<i> If you're lost
You can look
and you will find me</i>

1467
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:11,829
<i> Time after time</i>

1468
01:23:11,896 --> 01:23:17,234
<i> If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting</i>

1469
01:23:18,903 --> 01:23:21,706
<i> Time after time</i>

1470
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:43,094
<i> You say, go slow</i>

1471
01:23:43,828 --> 01:23:47,565
<i> I fall behind</i>

1472
01:23:47,632 --> 01:23:52,837
<i> If you're lost
You can look
and you will find me</i>

1473
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:57,575
<i> Time after time</i>

1474
01:23:57,642 --> 01:24:03,280
<i> If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting</i>

1475
01:24:04,782 --> 01:24:07,685
<i> Time after time</i>

1476
01:24:17,328 --> 01:24:20,432
<i> I'm always waiting</i>

1477
01:24:27,972 --> 01:24:30,875
<i> I'm always waiting </i>

1478
01:24:46,558 --> 01:24:48,225
Paulina! Dinner!

1479
01:24:48,993 --> 01:24:50,061
Okay.

1480
01:24:54,766 --> 01:24:56,501
Hey! Dinner. Now.

1481
01:24:56,568 --> 01:24:57,869
You're working too much.

1482
01:24:59,236 --> 01:25:01,138
Okay, I'll be right there.
