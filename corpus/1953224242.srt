1
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,488
Lightfoot:
This is Black Ice, on team

2
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,497
syncing at Level Five security.

3
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,590
Base: Roger that,
we're locked.

4
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,499
Base: Your next contact
is at 0430 at Melbourne Station

5
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,670
- then you're home.
- Lightfoot: Roger that.

6
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,113
Going full stealth.
Mean and extreme.

7
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,174
Base:
Mean and extreme, Captain.

8
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,030
(beeping)

9
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,191
Lightfoot: I have a bogie
at heading 176,

10
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,098
in pursuit.

11
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,011
(rapid beeping)

12
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,214
(metallic clanking)

13
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:30,494
(groans)

14
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,826
(groan)

15
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,115
(shrieking)

16
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,278
(gunshots)

17
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:01,183
(sizzling)

18
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,610
(screams)

19
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,925
Woman:
...Dr. Leon?

20
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,233
Doctor: Can I help you
with something?

21
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,276
Woman: Yeah, what's wrong
with that man?

22
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,539
May I ask who you are?

23
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,308
I'm Loren Mercer.

24
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,077
I'm here to meet
Dr. Leon from World Health.

25
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:44,111
I'm Samuel Leon.
My associate, Susana Gabriel.

26
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,284
The man is suffering
from necrotic paralysis.

27
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,056
Thus far, we have been
unable to treat it.

28
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,927
Man:
Doctor, sorry, I'm late.

29
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,866
You must be Mercer?

30
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,199
Lev Valentine,
nice to finally meet you.

31
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,434
So you need a pilot
to fly you somewhere in the Celebes?

32
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,031
That's right.

33
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,236
Some of that area
is disputed territory,

34
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,109
I've led expeditions
in the South Pacific.

35
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,879
I'm concerned about the landing.
There's a runway from World War II.

36
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,581
No plane has landed there for years.
It's out of the way.

37
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,521
So how'd the sick man get out?

38
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,755
By boat. Think you can make a beach
landing if the strip's no good?

39
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,160
I do it all the time,
but if you're worried...

40
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,563
Worried?
No, not at all.

41
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,566
What sort of expedition
is this exactly?

42
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,607
Medical. The native
was brought in by a missionary.

43
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,166
He told us that
Toe Boy's people are dying.

44
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,771
- Toe Boy?
- He'll be our guide.

45
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,941
And along with the medical mission,

46
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,951
we'd also like to identify

47
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,112
and isolate the vector
as soon as we can

48
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,019
to determine the threat it presents.

49
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,921
In English?

50
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,960
Find out exactly what bit him, dear.

51
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,858
Bit him?

52
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,123
Bit him.

53
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,222
A spider, we think.

54
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,859
Toe Boy's not being clear about it.

55
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,263
Second thoughts?

56
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,935
No. Get your gear to the airport,
we'll take off tomorrow at 8:00.

57
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,309
Dr. Leon:
Excellent.

58
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,610
(plane engine hums)

59
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,154
(humming stops)

60
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:39,797
Mercer: Hey, are you
looking for something?

61
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:43,706
Man: I found this magnificent
specimen of Nephila Edulis...

62
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,677
That could be poisonous.
Put that down!

63
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,546
All spiders have venom.
Arachnids eat by injecting

64
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,176
their prey with either
a necrotic factor,

65
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,243
a neurotoxin, or both.

66
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,982
When the prey is paralyzed

67
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,751
they cover it with digestive enzymes

68
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,520
and suck a syrupy biomass
into their stomachs.

69
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,654
That's more than I needed
to know. Now, put it down.

70
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,102
My book on arachnids.

71
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,509
Oh, Henri Capri.

72
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,203
You can keep it.

73
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,405
I hate spiders.

74
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,004
Everyone does.

75
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,573
My theory is that we recognize them

76
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,119
as perfect predators

77
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,712
and fear them.
She's harmless.

78
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,224
You really like them, don't you?

79
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,920
- I understand them.
- I just step on them.

80
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,860
They want the same things we do...

81
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,162
food, shelter, and a mate
to propagate the species.

82
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,113
- Leon: Hi, Mercer.
- Good morning, Doctor.

83
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,680
- I see you've met Dr. Capri.
- Oh yes.

84
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,419
He's our entomologist.

85
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,586
- Capri: Look what I found.
- No more spiders!

86
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,152
That spider is not coming.

87
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,892
- It won't bother anybody.
- Please, Capri, no.

88
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,530
Capri: How's your patient,
Dr. Leon?

89
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,666
He died this morning
of massive pulmonary edema.

90
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,610
Literally drowned in his own plasma.

91
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,670
- Doctor.
- Thanks.

92
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,411
I had tissue samples
forwarded to the CDC...

93
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,818
Good morning, everyone.
Doctors, Mercer.

94
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:36,912
Hi.

95
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,117
I'd like you to meet my adjunct,
Bear, and Pablo Reyes.

96
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,853
- Nice to meet you.
- Where's our...

97
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,327
That's the one over there.

98
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,956
Okay, Bear, load it up.

99
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,329
(Bear whistles)

100
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,202
Tell me, if you're
not worried about anything,

101
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,040
then why are we carrying enough
firepower to overthrow a small country?

102
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,079
Simple equation.

103
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,674
The more guns I have,
the safer I feel.

104
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,493
Insects are notorious

105
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,367
for carrying viruses and microbes.

106
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,031
However, I doubt very much

107
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:32,203
that spiders are capable...

108
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,076
to carry or transmit a virus.

109
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,639
Capri: My thinking
is that first of all...

110
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,048
Plane's in good shape.

111
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,746
Huh?

112
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,686
Valentine: I said the plane
is in good shape.

113
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,519
I learned on an old Piper.

114
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,616
My dad flew a crop duster
out of Fresno.

115
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,721
So you flew in the Marines, huh?

116
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,459
How did you know I was Corps?

117
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,229
You and Bear are cut that way.

118
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,498
"Semper fi, me and mine,

119
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,130
Marines until
the day we die."

120
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,107
Hooray!

121
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,042
So how come didn't
pilot them in yourself?

122
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,274
You knew the South Pacific.
I figured you'd bring us back.

123
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,248
That's odd, considering
we've never met,

124
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,842
and I'm fairly new to this area.

125
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,944
A fighter pilot
the Navy was fast-tracking

126
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,922
until you abruptly resigned
your commission.

127
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,959
Now you fly charters.

128
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,620
I did a background check.
Why'd you resign?

129
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,258
Let's just say
I'm looking for something.

130
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,130
Yeah?

131
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,259
Aren't we all?

132
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,201
(Valentine giggles)

133
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,501
Look, I'm not interested
in companionship,

134
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,234
relationship or even a hump buddy.

135
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,367
- Let's keep it professional.
- What?

136
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,004
Sorry to be blunt.
Just want to be clear.

137
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,210
Mercer, get over yourself.

138
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,983
Yeah. Like you weren't
bird-dogging around, jarhead.

139
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,992
Two girls are sitting there,
butt-fucking-naked...

140
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,154
Really?

141
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,072
Mercer: Guys,
this is our island.

142
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,391
I'm going to circle and try
to find the landing strip.

143
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,927
(plane engine sputters)

144
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,239
Shit!

145
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,175
- What happened to the power?
- I lost it.

146
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,614
- Restart the plane.
- I can't.

147
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,914
Everyone strap in and hold on.

148
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,752
Go manual on the hydraulics.

149
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,790
Manual?

150
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,055
Okay, pump up flaps 10%
and increase by 10%

151
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,394
every five seconds and call it out.

152
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,540
Buckle up, everybody,
we're in for a rough ride.

153
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,985
- Valentine: Flaps at 10%.
- Hang on, we're gliding in.

154
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,884
- Valentine: Flaps at 20%.
- You know any prayers?

155
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,393
Flaps at 30%.

156
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,333
Flaps at 40%.

157
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,829
Full flaps!

158
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,214
Whoa, whoa... whoa!

159
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,481
(crashing)

160
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,015
Nice flying, Mercer.

161
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,607
Nice praying.

162
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,242
Bear: This is Alpha 6,

163
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,621
come in, please. I repeat,
I repeat, come in, please.

164
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,626
This is Alpha 6.
This is Alpha 6, over.

165
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,254
- Bear: I repeat...
- Okay.

166
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,997
Well, how's it looking, Mercer?

167
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,271
There's absolutely nothing
wrong with the engine.

168
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,641
Then what caused the power failure?

169
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,044
No idea, but no one
is going anywhere soon.

170
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,413
That's quite obvious.

171
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,475
Bear's been trying the radio system.

172
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,952
The satellite phone's not working.

173
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,648
There seems to be some sort

174
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,883
of natural magnetic interference.

175
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,086
I just thank God we're not dead.

176
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,652
God wasn't flying
the plane, Susie, I was.

177
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,755
This entire expedition
is in serious jeopardy

178
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,199
because of you, Miss Mercer.
I'd appreciate it

179
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,862
if you'd at least show
some respect to my colleague.

180
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,905
Okay.

181
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,402
As soon as we finish here
we want to have a strategy meeting.

182
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,075
See what we can salvage
from this disaster.

183
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,641
Okay.

184
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,489
Capri?

185
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,321
Reyes, you seen Capri?

186
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,588
- I haven't, sir.
- Would you look for him?

187
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,993
Reyes: Okay.

188
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,429
You better put on some Deet.

189
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,028
Mosquito-borne encephalitis
is serious business out here.

190
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,970
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

191
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,532
I'm mega dosing vitamin B.
It keeps insects away naturally.

192
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,069
I don't do
artificial anything, Güerita.

193
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,215
Dios mío.

194
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,708
(whirring)

195
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,162
(sizzling)

196
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,419
Dr. Capri?

197
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,464
(rustling)

198
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,558
¡Puta Madre!

199
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,103
Capri: Stop!

200
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,363
Stop!

201
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,304
- Stop!
- Valentine: What's going on?

202
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,106
We're okay!
Coming back in.

203
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,774
Doc, what the hell was that thing?

204
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,318
Now we won't know, will we?

205
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,217
Come on, Doc, come on.

206
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,949
I am not a little child.

207
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,663
Sorry, Doc. Big meeting,
you're invited.

208
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:35,855
- I have to collect my equipment.
- Go.

209
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,657
- Go.
- Be careful.

210
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,890
Come on!

211
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,512
Valentine: Okay, here's
my recommendation.

212
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:04,351
We sit tight and try
to establish radio contact.

213
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,015
Mercer's checked the plane.

214
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,423
She thinks the engines are functional

215
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,687
and with any luck

216
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,093
we can probably attempt
a beach take-off.

217
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,961
I'm afraid we haven't had much luck

218
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,364
with the plane
or with Miss Mercer so far.

219
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,302
Yeah? If I don't get this plane
out of here then...

220
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,535
No, excuse me. We are here to give
medical aid to these people,

221
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,633
and learn what's killing them.

222
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,941
That's exactly what
we're going to do.

223
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,913
After we reach Toe Boy's village

224
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,348
we can discuss how best to proceed.

225
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,283
I don't think that's a good idea.

226
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,723
Mr. Valentine, I believe I'm still
in charge of this mission.

227
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,316
I'd rather take
my chances in the forest.

228
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,157
Every piece of electrical equipment

229
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,226
we had went out, including the plane.

230
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,070
I was in the cockpit. She's
the only reason that you're alive.

231
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,643
We break camp in the morning,
first light.

232
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,341
Bear, take the first watch.

233
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,752
Reyes, you spot him in four hours.

234
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,754
Yes sir.

235
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,695
That's liquid nitrogen,
Mr. Reyes.

236
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,064
If you accidentally drink it

237
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,695
it will freeze your esophagus.

238
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,638
Then the gas will expand inside you,

239
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:32,734
and you will blow up
like a balloon and explode.

240
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,450
(laughter)

241
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,849
Mercer:
Hey, hey, hey.

242
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,284
Where did you get this?

243
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,618
Do you understand me?
Where did you get this?

244
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,049
(Toe Boy speaking native language)

245
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,282
Here on the island?

246
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,792
(speaking native language)

247
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,127
- Valentine: Mercer.
- What?

248
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,222
I want you to reconsider.

249
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,995
- You should stay...
- Give me a brake. I'm not a baby.

250
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,037
Okay.

251
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,670
Good. Then I'll
see you tomorrow.

252
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,075
Good night.

253
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,450
Bear: This is Alpha 6.
Come in, please.

254
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:22,357
- Over. I repeat, this is Alpha 6.
- Any luck, Bear?

255
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,258
No, sir.

256
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:38,472
Mercer, I wouldn't take
what Leon says too seriously.

257
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,534
He's under a lot of stress.

258
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,048
What's Susie's story anyway?

259
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,481
Valentine: She was one
of his graduate students.

260
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,781
Became his assistant.

261
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:51,084
Wonder what she did
to earn her Masters?

262
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,124
Actually, Miss Mercer...

263
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,160
I spent three years
in the Brazilian rain-forest

264
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,561
classifying level III viral agents.

265
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,826
I was five months in Kikwit, Zaire,

266
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,095
tracking the source
of the Ebola virus.

267
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,831
That is where I met Samuel.

268
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,964
I can survive with just a knife,

269
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,134
shoot anything you put in my hands,

270
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,303
and I have a brown belt
in tae kwon do.

271
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,542
Impressive.
I just fly planes.

272
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,584
Apparently not well.

273
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,413
Anything else?

274
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,150
Yeah. I make
a great dehydrated stew,

275
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,886
and I can suggest something

276
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,588
for those unsightly blackheads
around your nose.

277
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,704
Quite a resume.
(laughs)

278
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,744
Okay, let's roll.

279
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,212
Get your gear, let's go.

280
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,530
Uhh...!

281
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,932
¡Chingado!

282
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,094
Stay away from there.

283
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,662
Puta madre.
¿Qué chingado es esto?

284
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,036
Aggh!!

285
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,941
Leon: Oye, Reyes,
¿qué pasó?

286
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,207
- Este chingado brazo.
- Déjame ver.

287
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,340
Wait!
These are ticks.

288
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,008
If you don't remove them correctly,

289
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,712
their venom
will remain under the skin

290
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,721
- and release neurotoxins.
- Fuck that! Get them off now!

291
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,053
You should have used
the insect spray, sir.

292
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,753
- (Reyes yells)
- Leon: Oh my God, look at that!

293
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,821
Yes, extraordinarily large.

294
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,924
Actually, this could be
a new species.

295
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,232
If you don't shut up, I'll kill you.

296
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,670
Okay?
Okay, cabrón?

297
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,674
Whoa!
Put the gun down.

298
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,575
Easy, buddy.
Easy. Breathe.

299
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,907
Put it down!

300
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,913
Look at me, God damn it!

301
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,040
Come on now, put the gun down.

302
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,084
Bear: That's it,

303
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,245
- Bear's got you.
- (Reyes groans)

304
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,957
I'll get them out.
Come on!

305
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,129
Susana, be careful.

306
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,604
We need to preserve
a sample of those ticks.

307
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,936
¡Vaya mierda!

308
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,879
- How you feeling, Doctor?
- I'm fine, it's just the heat.

309
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,778
Okay, everybody,
let's take a break here.

310
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,911
Take your packs off and take a rest.

311
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,851
Mercer?

312
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,591
Bear, do a reckon, five by five.

313
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,061
Yes, sir.

314
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,291
Susana, be careful with the water.

315
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,958
I need to wash him off.

316
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,265
Try to use as little as possible.

317
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,185
Mercer?

318
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,391
Mercer, are you okay?
Mercer?

319
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,323
Er... Mercer, there's ticks
out here. Be careful.

320
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,661
Look, I appreciate the heads up,

321
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,793
but I've been in the jungle before.

322
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,429
I can take care
of myself... Shit!

323
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,240
Mercer!

324
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,335
You okay?

325
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,004
Yeah.

326
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,072
Just stuck.

327
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,311
Huh.

328
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,910
It's not funny.

329
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,889
No, it's not.

330
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,162
Let's get you out of there.

331
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,164
Come on, you're stuck.
Aggh.

332
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,070
Oh God, look at this.

333
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,041
What?

334
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,273
It's all over
the inside of that hole.

335
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,338
I think there's something in here.

336
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,280
Well, don't piss it off.

337
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,842
Aggh!
Something's got my foot.

338
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,650
- Valentine: Hang on.
- Get me out of here.

339
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,887
Get me the fuck out of here, now!

340
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,258
- Bear!
- Get me out of here!

341
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,264
Get me the fuck out of here!

342
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,573
Shit!

343
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,983
Whew.

344
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,296
You okay?

345
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,732
Been better.

346
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,600
Stuck.

347
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,915
- Oh, shit.
- We're stuck.

348
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,147
(soft chuckle)

349
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,388
Okay. All right.

350
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,900
Ahem...

351
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,871
Okay.

352
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,510
Looks like spider silk.

353
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,950
- Your boot's still down there.
- Yeah, I know.

354
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,684
- Just leave it.
- You can't walk with one boot.

355
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,491
(grunts)

356
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,365
(hisses)

357
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,077
Look at this.

358
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,579
What could have done that?

359
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,242
(Reyes screams)

360
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,087
What's going on?
What the hell happened?!

361
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,125
Susana:
Help me!

362
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,989
(screaming)

363
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,258
(Reyes pants and screams)

364
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,391
Help me, I need to sedate him!

365
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,332
Easy partner, easy.

366
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,468
Easy, easy.

367
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,101
What's happening with him?

368
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,668
Shh!

369
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,179
Quieto, quieto.

370
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,783
Susana, what happened?

371
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,325
We were trying to get the ticks out.

372
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,884
As soon as we touched them
they buried deeper.

373
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,090
That's impossible.
Ticks don't move like that.

374
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,069
Okay, all right, this man's
in a lot of trouble.

375
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,627
Let's remove these ticks.

376
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,765
Is he going to be okay?

377
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,579
A field surgery would carry
a high risk of sepsis.

378
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,111
And if we try again to remove
them forcibly,

379
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,091
they could conceivably damage
something internally.

380
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,685
Will they harm him
if we leave them in?

381
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,960
The ixodides should simply disengage

382
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,796
once they're gorged with blood.

383
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,301
How are they gonna disengage?

384
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,838
They're under his skin,
for God's sake.

385
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,965
I don't know.

386
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,341
Come on, Capri.
You are the arachnologist.

387
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,175
Stiffen up, coño!

388
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:41,144
I... I don't know.

389
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,746
I've never seen or heard
of anything of the kind.

390
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:47,313
I don't know.

391
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,519
Doctor...

392
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,496
Your bedside manner
basically sucks, Doctor.

393
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,362
Can't you see the man is upset?

394
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,836
(Leon groans)

395
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,238
- (Reyes groans)
- Shh.

396
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,240
He's going to be all right.

397
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,251
Let's all get some Deet on.

398
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,617
Bear, let's get him up.

399
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,421
Where the hell did Capri go now?

400
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,017
That man's becoming a liability.

401
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,086
I'll get him.

402
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,434
Are you okay?

403
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:45,809
Sometimes I don't know
all the answers.

404
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,477
None of us do, Henri, all the time.

405
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,814
They look like ticks.

406
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,288
Something's not quite right here.

407
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,387
Yeah, I know.

408
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:04,731
I've been reading about ticks
in your book.

409
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,033
These days I never go anywhere
without it.

410
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,438
Come on, I need to spray you.

411
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,007
Cover your face.

412
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:26,520
I remember the first time
I soloed in an F-14 Tomcat.

413
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,924
I was so scared, I almost
planted it nose first into the deck.

414
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,928
They wanted to ground me.

415
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,157
I'm still flying.

416
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,504
We need you to take
a look at something.

417
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,131
Capri:
Um-hmm.

418
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,327
Mercer:
So what's the verdict?

419
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,666
Do you think it's spider webbing?

420
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,730
It would seem so.

421
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,638
Ridiculous.
The hole is much too large.

422
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,106
Agreed. A spider that large
couldn't exist.

423
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,776
Its internal organs would crush
under the force of gravity.

424
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,409
Maybe there's a simpler explanation.

425
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,545
Such as?

426
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,988
The Japanese occupied the islands,

427
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,959
dug tunnels everywhere.
Maybe this is one of those tunnels

428
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,292
that some spiders covered in silk.

429
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,459
That's certainly a plausible theory.

430
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,525
So what grabbed my boot?

431
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,808
(native language)

432
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,242
What is this, Capri?

433
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,808
These are normally found in caves.

434
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,548
I mean, it is an aganpofinus,

435
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:43,253
but it appears to be a mutation.

436
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,761
Mutated how?

437
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,661
Valentine: Dr. Leon

438
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,792
better come this way.

439
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,578
Where are they?

440
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,807
Maybe they're headed for the coast.

441
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,919
It smells like death here.

442
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,267
(in native language)

443
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,675
(thump)

444
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,319
(flapping)

445
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:25,220
What the hell do they
put on those darts?

446
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,362
Damn.

447
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,399
Normally that would be spider venom.

448
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,662
What kind of spider?

449
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,967
Most likely they use
the venom from a widow.

450
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,599
The neurotoxin can stop
a bird's heart in seconds.

451
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,404
Its even deadly to other spiders.

452
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,981
Now where was I?

453
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,683
Absolutely amazing.
Have a look, Doctor.

454
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,557
Ahh!

455
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,354
This specimen has no caeca.

456
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,798
I can't imagine
how it digests its prey.

457
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,768
Leon: What is
this structure?

458
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:06,962
It looks skeletal.

459
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:09,437
Capri: And that should
also be impossible.

460
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:13,375
Nothing with an external skeleton
has an internal one as well.

461
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,902
Nature would never be
so blatantly redundant.

462
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:22,911
Such a peculiar mutation
has never been on record.

463
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,518
(Reyes coughs)

464
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,995
Susana, can't you do
something about that man?

465
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,326
Yes, Doctor.

466
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,168
Is the sick man
bothering you, Doctor?

467
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,138
You bother me.

468
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,937
I'm tired of your attitude
and insults.

469
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,740
As you can see there's no one here.

470
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,610
This mission is over.

471
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,674
Why don't you go fix your plane
so we can get the hell out of here?

472
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,353
I'll talk to you later.

473
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,895
Mercer.
Hey Mercer!

474
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,521
I'm fine. I'm going...

475
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,396
- to do a little...
- Take it easy, will ya?

476
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,502
What are you looking for
out there? Huh?

477
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,937
I know.

478
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:25,573
I know it's not a relationship
or a hump buddy.

479
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:32,184
Just stay here, please.
Right here.

480
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,620
Wait.

481
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,632
I'm sorry I was a bitch on the plane.

482
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,862
Huh?

483
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,004
Look...

484
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,434
I found this on one of the natives.

485
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,241
Yeah, they've all got this.
It looks like parachute silk.

486
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,875
Yeah, well...

487
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,882
I think it belonged to my brother.

488
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,594
Your brother, what...?

489
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,425
(retching)

490
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,227
- It's okay. Breathe.
- (Reyes coughs)

491
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,170
It's okay.

492
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,471
(Reyes vomits)

493
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,445
Ahh!

494
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,163
(grunts)

495
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,328
No, please don't shoot it.

496
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,728
(coughing)

497
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,061
Samuel, do something!

498
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,569
- (grunting)
- (Rattling)

499
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,339
(rattling)

500
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,274
(grunting)

501
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,278
(crackling)

502
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,350
(heavy breathing)

503
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,523
(Reyes screams)

504
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,314
(hissing)

505
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,455
(footsteps)

506
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,084
Shit!

507
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,624
(in native language)

508
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,600
We're coming in.

509
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:47,640
Shit!

510
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:48,837
Mercer, what is it?

511
00:45:48,908 --> 00:45:50,188
There's something in the jungle.

512
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:52,144
What did I tell you
about going in the jungle?

513
00:45:52,145 --> 00:45:52,585
It's big...

514
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:53,773
(scream)

515
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,449
(in native language)

516
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,511
Go to the camp!
Everybody by the fire.

517
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,420
Mercer stay here!

518
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,289
(scream)

519
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,851
(growling)

520
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,987
(squealing)

521
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,328
(growling)

522
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,332
- (thud)
- (Loud squeal)

523
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,715
(rustling)

524
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,991
(slithering)

525
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,090
(rustling)

526
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,071
(slithering)

527
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,855
(rattling)

528
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,330
(squeal)

529
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,533
(animal whistling)

530
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:38,011
Is everyone all right?

531
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,312
- Susana: Yes.
- Mercer?

532
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:51,223
Mercer?

533
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,098
My brother Joli was a Navy Pilot.

534
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,637
The plane he was testing,
a stealth craft,

535
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,803
disappeared 10 months ago.

536
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,312
The Navy stopped looking
after two months.

537
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,446
I didn't.

538
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,856
They never came to a real
conclusion about what happened.

539
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,486
Some bullshit about...

540
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,087
pilot error, presumed dead.

541
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:40,604
Too good a pilot.

542
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,577
Too good a man.

543
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,116
(Toe Boy, in native language)

544
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,923
(in native language)

545
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,263
My God!

546
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,326
What did this?

547
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,304
(in native language)

548
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,673
Capri: Apart from
the extraordinary size,

549
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,651
this is
inter-species mutation.

550
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,380
Like the small spider?

551
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:29,283
Yeah, but far
more biologically advanced.

552
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,350
These creature seem to be evolving

553
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,420
at lightning speed towards
becoming the ultimate predators.

554
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,523
I thought that was us.

555
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,966
If spiders were as big as cats

556
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,766
the human race would be finished.

557
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,904
Dr. Leon, we've got
to take it back with us.

558
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,669
We've got to get
ourselves back first.

559
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:55,309
You were hired to take us in
and bring us out, with the specimens.

560
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,579
Do you have a problem?

561
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,952
I got one man dead,
I got another man dying.

562
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,854
Your expedition's over, Doctor.

563
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:04,758
We head back
at first light, with specimens,

564
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,160
if there's anyone left to carry them.

565
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,221
I'm sorry, sir, I can't possibly go.

566
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:12,268
I'm going to send Bear
up into those hills tomorrow

567
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,133
to try to send a signal back to Guam.

568
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,605
The rest of us
are heading to the beach.

569
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,869
Doctor, please.

570
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:23,435
You can't stay here alone.

571
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,777
We're going to wait for help

572
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,579
or until that plane is airworthy.

573
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,784
- Valentine, I'm staying.
- Can't let you do that.

574
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,261
I'm not leaving without my brother.

575
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,427
- You can come back for him.
- No.

576
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,400
You were hired as our pilot.

577
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:47,960
Do yourjob.

578
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,472
We'll meet you
back at the plane tomorrow.

579
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,704
Yes sir.

580
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,275
Bear...

581
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,079
be careful, huh?

582
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,916
You bet your ass.

583
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,833
Mercer.

584
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,607
Mercer, I'll help you
find your brother.

585
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:13,445
You're right.

586
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,050
He's here somewhere.

587
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:27,301
Just help me get
these people out of here

588
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,565
and I'll come back with you.

589
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,309
- Okay.
- Leon: Where cojones is Capri?

590
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:39,078
Damn.

591
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,528
(soft buzzing)

592
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:23,050
I swear, when I find
that gilipollas entomologist...

593
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:54,114
? When I get home
I'm going to see my baby ?

594
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:58,422
? It's been long,
she's feeling kind of shady ?

595
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:02,795
? But I love her, oh I love her ?

596
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,825
? Yes I do, yes I do. ?

597
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,029
- (laughing)
- (Rustling)

598
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,368
Yeah. That's how we do it
back home, baby.

599
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,876
- (whoosh)
- (Screams)

600
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,341
Ahh!

601
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,541
Get behind me!

602
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,184
(rustling)

603
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,921
Ahh!

604
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,522
Don't worry about Bear,
he can take care.

605
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,033
Let's keep moving.
Let's go. Let's go.

606
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,046
Oh, fuck!

607
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:57,787
(Capri groans)

608
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,139
This is it.

609
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,114
Dying ecosystem.

610
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,983
A mutant...

611
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,489
a mutant, prominent,

612
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,184
arachnoid and reptilian features.

613
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:40,127
A predator of enormous potential,

614
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:44,098
and correctly
adapted for the environment.

615
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,829
However, it seems to be
destroying its own habitat.

616
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,100
Why? Huh?

617
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:54,735
(wheezing)

618
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,974
(squealing)

619
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,387
(sniffing and coughing)

620
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,984
Massive organic decay.
That's what we're smelling.

621
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,323
Yeah, but from where?

622
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,024
From what is the more
salient question.

623
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,475
Mercer.

624
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,774
What?

625
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,744
You better take a look at this.

626
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,426
My God!

627
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,003
Valentine: Your brother?

628
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,378
I'm so sorry for you.

629
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,420
What did this?

630
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,854
(in native language)

631
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:16,118
A spider.

632
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:19,286
(in native language)

633
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:57,791
Fuck the sonofabitch
that did this to you!

634
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,710
(wheeze)

635
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,336
Capri:
Web spiders produce

636
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,007
seven different types of silk,

637
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:19,419
sticky silk, web frame silk,
egg sack silk,

638
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:23,152
dragline...

639
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:28,186
cocoon silk.

640
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,698
(in native language)

641
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:46,843
(Capri groans)

642
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:03,599
Capri: It's injected
some kind of nerve toxin

643
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:09,036
into my spinal column.
Now so I don't feel much.

644
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,039
Although my nose,

645
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,440
does twitch occasionally.

646
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,708
This is truly astounding.

647
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,716
(Capri laughs)

648
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,752
Okay, I'm going to cut him loose.

649
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,050
No, stop! I beg you.

650
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:31,025
This stuff is stronger than
steel, and besides

651
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,392
you can't cut me
from the cocoon anymore.

652
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:37,923
My insides are feeding the eggs.

653
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,492
Whose eggs?
What is this thing?

654
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:46,206
Capri: I don't know.

655
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,300
It's spider-like.

656
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:52,280
It's massive.
If it breeds successfully...

657
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,873
So all the other spiders
are his offspring?

658
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,784
Yes, but they are not viable yet.

659
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:02,018
It hasn't found the right
genetic combination.

660
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:05,458
Leon: You're saying a giant
spider evolved in this island

661
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,463
and it's trying
to further adapt by evolution?

662
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:12,058
No. Nothing so large
and so alien

663
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,764
could have evolved in our gravity.

664
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,465
Alien?

665
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,271
(rumbling)

666
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,938
(in native language)

667
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,378
What? What did you say?

668
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:28,110
(in native language)

669
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,742
My God, is it here?

670
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,420
Out here somewhere.

671
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,423
(grunting)

672
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:42,092
(grunting)

673
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,868
Capri: Oh please.

674
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,597
What?

675
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,229
Kill me now.

676
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:52,604
No!

677
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,347
Susana, get my kit.

678
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,746
But he's pumped with spider toxins,

679
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:04,378
- he doesn't know what he's saying!
- Miss Mercer, Capri is dying!

680
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,684
(Capri groans)

681
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,417
Can't you give him something?

682
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,049
To cure him?

683
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,684
Leon: No.

684
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:14,059
To help him.

685
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,197
He's right, Loren.

686
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,234
It'll take a few moments, okay?

687
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:33,576
(Capri groans)

688
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,247
(Capri sighs and whimpers)

689
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,925
All spiders go to heaven.

690
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,090
Didn't I read that in your book?

691
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:56,696
Please take my samples back with you.

692
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,834
I would like this species
to be named after me.

693
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,979
Henri Capri.
I'll make sure.

694
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,448
(squelching)

695
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,253
For God's sake, let's go!

696
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,160
Leon: Let's go, now!

697
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,754
(squealing)

698
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,630
- For God's sake, let's go!
- Step back, now!

699
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:30,035
(Toe Boy in Native Language)

700
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,937
Leon: Susana, run!

701
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,908
(squealing)

702
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,034
(in native language)

703
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,078
(squelching)

704
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,181
(squealing)

705
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,651
(gunshots)

706
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,950
Let's go!

707
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,924
(squeals)

708
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:50,924
(gunshots)

709
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:51,960
Enough!

710
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,223
No! This thing's not killing
any more people!

711
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,958
Come on!

712
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,972
(growling)

713
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,221
Valentine: Susana!

714
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,223
Wait! Wait!

715
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,258
Shit!

716
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,817
Shit!

717
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,228
- Susana: Get me out of here!
- Hey! Hey!

718
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:33,792
Get me out of here!

719
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,201
(Toe Boy in native language)

720
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,813
Shit! Help!

721
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:00,118
- (squealing)
- Leon: Ahhh!

722
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,993
(in native language)

723
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,090
(squeals)

724
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:09,026
Get me out of here!

725
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,171
(Leon screams)

726
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,642
(squealing)

727
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,106
Susana: Help me, please.

728
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,808
Mercer, I need some help.

729
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,783
I got an idea.

730
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,621
Okay, break it.

731
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,797
- There. Come on.
- Okay, retreat.

732
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,238
Where's Leon?

733
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:53,441
Leon?

734
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:57,213
(growl)

735
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,515
Leon?

736
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,193
Susana: What is this place?

737
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,600
Valentine: Must be left over
from the war.

738
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,580
Okay. Check all the doors and
windows.

739
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,861
(rattling)

740
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,368
There's a storage room or
something back there

741
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,267
but it's locked.
We can't get in.

742
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:50,805
Mercer: Where's Toe Boy?

743
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,142
I was just thinking,

744
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,983
I've never faced anything
that I could not kill

745
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,546
with a loaded gun and now,
I don't even have that,

746
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:12,390
I've got a 45 and a half a clip.

747
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,622
Valentine: What about you?

748
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,187
About the same.

749
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,062
I still have four rounds.

750
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,937
(clanging)

751
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:30,536
(growling)

752
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,998
(groaning)

753
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,200
(clang)

754
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:18,119
Aww!

755
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:22,722
(loud squealing)

756
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,367
Ahh!

757
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,468
(squeals)

758
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,308
(groaning)

759
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,745
(heaving)

760
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,558
(loud grunting)

761
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,662
(groaning)

762
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:04,732
Ahh!

763
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:13,445
(squeals)

764
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:14,483
Aww!

765
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:18,377
(growls)

766
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,746
Uggh!

767
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,181
Susana: Where is it?

768
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,784
I don't know.

769
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,260
It didn't penetrate much

770
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,456
but I'm not sure about the venom.

771
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:30,897
I'll be okay.

772
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,490
Just sit down and rest!

773
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,794
I'll barricade the windows
and the doors.

774
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,600
Can you work an M-16?

775
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:39,402
You better believe it, sugar.

776
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:40,567
Good.

777
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:53,254
(Valentine shivers)

778
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:09,029
How are you feeling?

779
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:12,673
I'm cold.
I've got a fever.

780
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:16,609
Thanks for asking.

781
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,482
Anything interesting?

782
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,315
I don't know.

783
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,150
Let me see.

784
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,954
Spiders are susceptible
to drugs and toxins.

785
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,654
Maybe there's something
in the med kit?

786
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,758
You think you want
to get close enough

787
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,961
to that thing to give it a shot?

788
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,368
I don't know.

789
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,267
If you come across anything
interesting let me know.

790
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:01,218
(crackling)

791
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,695
(thwak)

792
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,685
(crackling)

793
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,695
Mercer: Quick Susana,
get off your butt!

794
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,254
Now! Go!

795
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,564
Go!

796
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,729
(groaning)

797
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:29,834
(squeals)

798
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,110
What's it doing?

799
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,115
I don't know...

800
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,084
(squealing)

801
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,120
Mercer: But we can't
stay here.

802
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,748
What about the back room?

803
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:47,326
(squealing)

804
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:48,090
Shit!

805
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,613
Ahh!

806
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,897
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

807
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,971
You're the female
equivalent of Tarzan.

808
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,272
Jungles, I do fine.

809
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:39,473
Small rooms and big spiders
are a problem.

810
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,679
(heaving outside)

811
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,289
What? I'm not dead yet?

812
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:58,430
No, but you will
if we don't get you out.

813
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,960
(panting)

814
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,935
I don't hear it.

815
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,571
Mercer, do you think it's gone?

816
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,138
I doubt it.

817
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,240
I don't see it.

818
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,539
Take it easy, Susana.

819
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:43,771
Take it easy.

820
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,677
It's not out there.

821
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,078
Great, now take it easy.

822
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,414
For God's sake, I can't stay in here.

823
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,783
Yes we can, Susana.

824
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,015
- It's gone. Look!
- For God's sake!

825
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,886
(squealing)

826
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,516
Susana!

827
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,858
Ahh!

828
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,590
Susana!

829
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,825
(screams)

830
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,300
(squealing)

831
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,728
- (thud)
- (Screaming)

832
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,039
Fuck you!

833
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,879
(spider squeals)

834
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:25,209
(blast)

835
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:29,314
(loud squeal)

836
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,689
Aggh!

837
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,900
- (bang)
- Christ!

838
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,137
Shit!

839
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:45,438
(bang)

840
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,536
Look, look!

841
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,877
- Mercer: What?
- Valentine: It must be a way out

842
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:55,439
for the war. Open it!

843
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:57,652
(bang)

844
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:01,616
Mercer:
Ahh! Are you coming?

845
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:03,815
(spider squeals)

846
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,927
Ahh!

847
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,393
(spider squeals)

848
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,099
Come on.

849
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:16,763
Aggh!

850
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,056
Mercer: This way.

851
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,769
We're clear.

852
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:02,143
Okay. Okay.

853
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:07,081
I got to rest.

854
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:10,090
Just for a minute.

855
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:14,188
Awww!

856
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,338
Oh my...

857
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,718
Man's voice: Loren...

858
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,564
Mean and extreme, Loren.

859
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,108
I've been waiting for you.

860
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,578
What took you so long?

861
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,517
Joli...

862
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,554
Uhh!

863
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,027
What's wrong, Loren?

864
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,530
Don't you like the new mother nature?

865
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,446
(screams)

866
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:01,634
Oh, shit.

867
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,802
What happened to you?

868
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,867
Ran into my man back at his village.
He picked up your trail.

869
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:11,810
Did you get anywhere on the radio?

870
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,609
No such luck,
interference everywhere.

871
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:20,216
Mercer: He's got a fever.

872
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:21,846
Where's the rest?

873
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:31,899
Something back in the jungle...

874
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,128
killed my brother too.

875
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:41,575
I want it, Bear.

876
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:44,077
(gun clicks)

877
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,909
I want it dead.

878
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,816
That's why me and my man are here.

879
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,357
Aww!

880
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,797
Hey... hey.

881
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,672
Okay, I'm going to leave you this.

882
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,729
- No.
- Just take it.

883
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,002
I'll be okay.

884
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,873
Don't worry.
I've got her covered.

885
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:19,709
Hey, the next time you need a pilot,

886
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,612
don't call me.

887
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:27,751
We'll be back for you.

888
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,553
Hooray!

889
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,991
Semper fi, me and mine.

890
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,188
(Mercer laughs)

891
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:40,067
- Go, let's go.
- Yep.

892
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,491
(snap)

893
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,738
Bear: What in the hell?

894
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:34,043
No, That's it.

895
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,447
That's the cocoon.

896
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:39,715
Mercer: It's in molt.
Bear: Molt?

897
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,951
When they come out of those things
they're usually soft.

898
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,952
God, it's breeding.

899
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:51,362
Look at all those eggs.

900
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,403
I'm going up.

901
01:22:57,472 --> 01:22:58,905
Hey, hey, going where?

902
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,966
I got to take a closer look.
Cover me, okay?

903
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:05,274
Shit!

904
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:37,173
Okay, it's in here.

905
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:40,806
I am going to try and get it down.

906
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:42,213
Mercer: When I do,

907
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:44,376
give it all you got.

908
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,886
Shit.

909
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:02,293
It's not working.

910
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,547
Oh no, Bear!
Bear, it's waking up!

911
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:21,880
Oh my God, Bear!
Bear, get out!

912
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,558
Bear, get out of here!

Ahhh!

935
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:49,502
(spider screams)

936
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,669
(sighs)

937
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,266
Fuck!

938
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:54,561

(spider squeals)

943
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:30,268
(Mercer whimpers)

944
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:32,568

Shit!

951
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,571
No fucking way!

Fuck!

957
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,898
I hate spiders.

958
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:43,604
Take it easy.

959
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,976
- Is it dead?
- Yeah, it's dead.

960
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:55,042
Okay. Let's get
the hell out of here!

961
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,777
Come on.
