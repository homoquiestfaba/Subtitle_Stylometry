Oh, what, now you care?
No, what happened?

1438
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,610
I'll tell you what happened.

1439
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:15,010
We didn't have enough money
in our little deal,

1440
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,280
did we, Coach?

1441
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,280
Oh, that's great, man.

1442

The guy who goes around
evicting people

1443
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,450
because they can't afford
to pay their rent.

1444
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,650
And money's not
important to you?

1445
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,850
First of all, that's my job.

1446
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:25,350
Therefore it's fine?
Second of all,

1447
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,390
you're going to find out
how important money is

1448
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,390

I'd buy a new suit.

Yeah.

1455
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,380
It's gonna be
a slam dunk, Richard.

1456
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,480
Guaranteed, we'll have that
lot cleared by Labor Day.

00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480

The Honorable
Judge McKibben presiding.

00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:15,940
You may be seated.

1466
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,110
Your testimony, then,

1467
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,780
is that this
pay-or-quit notice

1468
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,520
was properly served.

1469
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,280
Yes, Your Honor,
the second time.

1470
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:33,450
The second time?

1471
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,850
Yes, sir, the first attempt
was unsuccessful.

1472
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,720
The defendant
was not cooperative?

1473
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,760
Well, yes and no.

1474
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,130
Well, which is it?

1475
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,770
Well, sir, the first time
I tried to notify him,

1476
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,350
he, uh, inhibited
the delivery of process.

1477
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,350
How?

assistant Mr. Clark here,

1483
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:00,230
is new to these

00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:01,300
If it please
the court--

1485
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,700
Yeah, it pleases the court
just fine.

1486
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,830
Look, we have a full calendar
this afternoon.

1487
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,900
I don't see any reason

1488
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,500
why Mr. Barnes'
failure to pay his rent

1489
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:11,070
should take up any more
of the court's time.

1490
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,340
Mr. Barnes, please rise.

1491
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,580
Mr. Barnes...

1492
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,980
is there anything
you'd like to say

1493
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,050
in your own behalf?

1494
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,050
Um...

1495
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,920
No, Your Honor,
the way I see it,

1496
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920

1497
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,960

00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,460
Well, with all due respect,
Your Honor,

1499
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,400
uh, it seems to me
the issue here's money,

1500
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,540
not what
I'm gonna say.

1501
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,680
Very well.

1502
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,280

of this court--

00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,120
Uh, Your Honor, I have further
pertinent evidence.

00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,450
Well, good
for you, son.

Sit down.

Except that I was
just about to rule

1507
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
in favor of the plaintiff.
That means you guys.

1508
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,530
Yes, sir.
I understand that.

1509
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,460
However, there are
several elements

1510
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,830
that should be cleared up.

1511
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,630
Elements that are germane
to the case.

1512
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,430
What is he doing?

1513
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,130
I have no idea.

1514
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,810
According to Sections 1161
through 1179 inclusive

1515
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,980
of the Civil Code,
in a month-to-month rental,

1516
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:20,780
notice of increase cannot
be less than 30 days.

1517
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,480
Yeah, I'm very well versed
on the Civil Code, young man.

1518
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,650
Mr. Sidney,
was sufficient notice given

1519
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:27,920
for the rent increase or not?

1520
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,750
It most certainly was,
Your Honor.

1521
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,790
I beg to differ, sir.

1522
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,460
You see, defendant Barnes
was given notice

1523
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,830
on February 1st of this year

1524
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,630
that on March 1st,
his rent would be increased.

1525
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,960
That's 28 days,

1526
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,000
two days shy
of the legal 30 required.

1527
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,030
Your Honor,

1528
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,670
this is a technicality,
Your Honor--

1529
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,670
As a consequence,

1530
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:46,900
the increase
is not only invalid,

1531
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,170
but implies that the
plaintiff's eviction attempts,

1532
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,880
according to section
1942.4 of the Civil Code,

1533
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,880
were retaliatory.

1534
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,210
I call the court's
attention

1535
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,710

language used

1536
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,980
in the notices
sent to Mr. Barnes.

1537
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,320

wishes to refute...
