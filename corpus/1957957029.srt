00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,112
Look forward to
having you onboard.

351
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,598
All right, all right.

352
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,794
You remember when I told you
to get up to speed, and fast?

353
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,474
I meant speedier and faster.

354
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,476
Carrier quals are at
the end of the week.

355
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,478
You can'’t land a corsair
on the Leyte,

356
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,654
uh, you get yourself
a nice dry-land job in Topeka

357
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,917
or some place even shittier,
god help you.

358
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,658
Either way,

359
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,444
start settling up
your bar tab, boys.

360
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,837
We are leaving Rhode Island.

361
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,057
[Pilot] Ah, here it comes.

362
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:19,806
Just because I'’m going
doesn'’t mean I'’m fighting, Daisy.

363
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,156
[Sighs]

364
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,686
That'’s the deal, darling.

365
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:32,993
Remember?

366
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,607
We knew this day might come.

367
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,742
And yet it doesn'’t
make it any easier.

368
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,145
But we'’ll be okay.

369
00:24:58,975 --> 00:24:59,975
Mad...

370
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,195
[Chuckles]

371
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,719
but okay.

372
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:05,329
Okay.

373
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:10,770
[Sighs]

374
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,861
Jesse, what'’s going on?

375
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:16,645
Honestly...

376
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:23,870
My mind'’s on landing
that corsair tomorrow.

377
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,657
You never met a plane
you couldn'’t land, Jesse.

378
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:32,139
This plane
will be the death of me.

379
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,533
I can'’t see like I can
out of a bearcat.

380
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:38,972
Fogs my instincts.

381
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,847
Your instincts...

382
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,199
Are one of the few things
in this world that I trust.

383
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:52,942
And if you can'’t
trust that plane,

384
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,162
you gotta put it in whatever
will get you down safe.

385
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,574
Yes, ma'’am.

386
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,076
- [Marty] You ready, Carol?
- [Carol] Try and keep up, Marty.

387
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
[Bo] Bottom of the board
buys drinks tonight, boys.

388
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,712
[Marty] I hope you brought cash.

389
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,516
[Bo] Won'’t need it,
we'’ll be spending yours.

390
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,194
[Door opens]

391
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,503
[Door closes]

392
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,660
[Breathes deeply]

393
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,505
You ain'’t shit.

394
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,339
[Exhales]

395
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,911
You ain'’t never landing
that plane, nigger.

396
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:39,614
Boy.

397
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:50,059
Your monkey-ass
shouldn'’t even be flying.

398
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,678
[Grunts]

399
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,508
[Breathes heavily]

400
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,211
[Grunts]

401
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,570
[Sniffles]

402
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:41,545
[Sniffles, breathes heavily]

403
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,400
[Officer on pa] Flight ops
commence, flight ops commence.

404
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:13,708
Be aware of all prop wash.
All hands on deck.

405
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,122
[Sailor] Don'’t need all hands.

406
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,103
[Sailor 2] Doing it!

407
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:19,298
[Officer on pa] All repair
parties, man your stations.

408
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:21,455
All repair parties,
man your stations.

409
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:23,762
[Crew shouting, chattering]

410
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:29,898
[Engine roaring]

411
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,430
- [Dick] That'’s hudner.
- [Carol] Mm-hmm.

412
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:50,310
[Officer on radio] You'’re on a good
approach, hudner. Just keep an eye on the lso.

413
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:13,288
[Grunts]

414
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,815
All right, pretty boy.

415
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,821
[Cable wobbles]

416
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,877
All right, three-to-one
he misses it.

417
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,096
I'’ll take the action.

418
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,315
Bonus if he splashes?

419
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,535
[Chuckles] Christ, Bo,
we Don'’t want him dead.

420
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:45,060
[Landing gear whirs]

421
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,554
Looks like they wanna see
Jackie Robinson steal home.

422
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,174
[Officer on radio]
Ensign brown, you'’re too high.

423
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,611
That'’s a shit approach.

424
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:32,194
Come on. Get your nose up.

425
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,720
Why isn'’t he listening
to the lso?

426
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,465
[Grunts]

427
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,905
[Engine roars]

428
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,821

[Grunts]

431
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,805
[Officer on radio] That was pretty
close, brown. Do you wanna call it?

432
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:00,440
I'’m coming back around.

433
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,532
[Officer on pa]
Crash crew, stand by.

434

[Breathes heavily]

435
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,805
[Officer on radio]
You'’re still too high, brown.

436
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,815
You'’re not in the groove.

437
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:29,425
I'’ll get there.

438
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,485
[Grunts]

439
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:54,624

443
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:12,860
All right, Jesse.

444

[Sailor] Attaboy!

445

Fod walk in 15 Mikes.
All available hands on deck.

448
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,351
Fod walk in 15 Mikes.

449
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,441
Doesn'’t matter how you did it.
Just matters that you got down, pal.

450
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:31,096
[Dick] Fellas,

451
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:33,533
you all passed
your carrier quals.

452
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,056
[All cheer]

453
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,381
[Pilot] That'’s what
I'’m talking about.

454
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:38,016
Top marks go to... Yeah.

455
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,409
Lieutenant hudner with
the only perfect grade.

456
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,671
Oh, bastard.

457
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:43,717
Which brings us to ensign brown.

458
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:46,633
D-n-k-u-a!

459
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,331
[All] Damn near killed us all.

[Dick] Enjoy tonight, boys.
We ship out in the morning.

461
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,945
And now is the time,
if you haven'’t already,

462
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,382
get all your affairs in order.

463
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:58,949
All right.

464
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:04,055
[Pilot] What affairs do you
have to get in order, my friend?

465
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,784
[Pilot 2] I'’m headed
to Denver, boys.

466
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,958
That was some landing.

467
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,701
[Pilot 3] I'’m never
too drunk to drive.

468
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,572
Just trying to
keep it interesting.

469
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:18,317
You get your car fixed yet?

470
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,108
You heading to the bar
with the guys?

471
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:28,978
I Don'’t think so.

472
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,114
[Clears throat]

473
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:35,768
Wanna come in?

474
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:44,952
[Engine stops]

475
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:51,784
Hey, Daisy?

476
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:53,525
Yes?

477
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,701
[Door closes]

478
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,144
What did I tell you?

479
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,018
Yes, ma'’am.

480
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,369
[Child] Mommy?

481
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:11,543
Oh.

482
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,546
Let me get her.Okay.

483
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,899
Nice to see you again. You as well.

484
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,864
[Mumbles]

485
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:29,170
Which one do you like?

486
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,391
The blue one?

487
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,480
The gray one?

488
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,092
The gray one.

489
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,922
You had a good day? Mm-hmm.

490
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,445
Yeah? uh-huh.

491
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:44,620
What'’d you do?

492
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,536
You Don'’t remember?

493
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,711
Here you are.

494
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:51,845
Thought Jesse didn'’t drink.

495
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,063
He doesn'’t.

496
00:35:54,587 --> 00:35:55,588
[Chuckles]

497
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,071
Your husband'’s
quite the aviator.

498
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,204
Well, he must feel
the same way about you.

499
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,538
Because you and Carol mohring

500
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,164
are the only boys
from fighting 32

501
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,817
that he has ever invited over.

502
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:10,907
It'’s good to know the men
you'’re flying with.

503
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,388
See what they'’re fighting for.

504
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:15,738
I like that.

505
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,266
And what about you, Tom?
What are you fighting for?

506
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,138
God, country and honor aside.

507
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:25,705
You know, Mrs. Brown, I'’m...

508
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,186
Hoping to find that out.

509
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,752
[Jesse laughs]

510
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:30,971
Come on.

511
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,713
- Come on.
- [Child] Okay.

512
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,672
Don'’t be fooled by his
strong, silent act, by the way.

513
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:37,891
He trusts you,

514
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:41,416
I swear, he'’s the funniest
man you'’ll ever know.

515
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,551
I can'’t say he'’s shown me
that side yet.Mm-hmm.

516
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:48,293
Something to look
forward to. [Chuckles]

517
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:51,209
Well, you'’re about to spend
a lot of time together.

518
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,776
Lot of time
in very small spaces.

519
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,003
May I ask you a favor?

520
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,223
Of course.

521
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:10,228
Second he steps on that ship
and into that plane,

522
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,969
I can'’t protect him anymore.

523
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:15,102
So I need you to be there
for my Jesse.

524
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:17,409
Okay?

525
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:21,935
Okay.

526
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:24,938
Okay.

527
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,156
[Jesse] Good?

528
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,116
- [Child] Hmm.
- [Jesse] That was good, yeah?

529
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,378
Uh-huh.mm-hmm.

530
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:31,771
[Daisy chuckles]

531
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,163
Who is this?

532
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,819
This is Pam.

533
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,648
Hi, Pam.

534
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:44,740
[Mimics airplane]

535
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:49,025
I Don'’t think she wants to
embarrass you, lieutenant.

536
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,049
[Daisy chuckles]

537
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,791
It'’s too late. Come on.

538
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,229
She might hold the stick
better than you.Okay.

539
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:56,665
[Chuckles]

540
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,972
Well, I know
it'’s our last night here,

541
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:02,018
so I'’ll let you all enjoy it together.
Thank you again for the drink.

542
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:04,238
You'’re very welcome. I'’ll walk ya out.

543
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,739
Just be careful.

544
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,873
Worst thing that can happen
to me is a bad sunburn.

545
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,702
You come back as black as you
like, as long as you come home.

546
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,944
'’cause you'’re taking me to
The Bahamas when you get back.

547
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,056
Bahamas?

548
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,623
If I get some shore time,

549
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:44,670
I'’ll get you one of
those European swimsuits.

550
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,282
One of those two-piece things.

551
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:01,469
Tootie...

552
00:39:03,819 --> 00:39:06,169
You know you can always
come back here and wave to me.

553
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:12,785
I'’m only 5,000 miles
that way.[Chuckles]

554
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:18,094
I'’ll wave back.Mm-hmm.

555
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,709
The only person I ever met

556
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,799
belonged in the sky.

557
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:33,501
Just remember you belong
down here with us, too, okay?

558
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,296
[Sighs]

559
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,522
I'’ll write you
every week.Mm-hmm.

560
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,351
I know you will.

561
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:00,093
[Sighs]

562
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,344
[All panting]

563
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,372
[Sailor] Break those
chains down.

564
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,919
[Officer on pa] Secure from
general quarters. All hands!

565
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,660
Secure from general quarters.

566
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:35,667
Maybe you'’d be faster if we
did this in the middle of the night.

567
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,161
What you Don'’t
seem to understand

568
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:39,235
is that someday soon,
this is gonna be real.

569
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,629
And you have to do a
hell of a lot better than that!

570
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,762
[All] Yes, sir.

571
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:46,329
All right.

572
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,244
[Sailor] I gotta
run him down to 2-a.

573
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,377
I am getting tired
of getting ready.

574
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,597
Tired of living in this
floating sardine can.

575
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:54,250
Tired of you smelling like one.

576
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:55,687
That'’s what men smell like.

577
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:57,645
Something to look forward to
one day, Fritz.

578
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,386
Most excitement
we'’ve seen in days.

579
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,996
[Captain sisson] Ensign brown.

580
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,434
Could I speak to you
for a moment?

581
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,524
Careful what you wish for.

582
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,351
[Sailor] I'’ll go ahead
and respot it.

583
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,572
Aye, sir.

584
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:13,487
Huh.

585
00:42:20,102 --> 00:42:21,103
[Camera pops]

586
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:27,196
Do we have to do this
above deck?

587
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,982
Oh, yeah. It'’s great having
you right in front of your plane.

588
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,157
Relax. You look great.

589
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:33,072
[Tom] What'’s going on?

590
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,161
[Dick] Lifemagazine is here.

591
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:38,009
I guess the Pentagon wanted
something positive for the folks back home.

592
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,384
Help '’em swallow the pill
of another potential war.

593
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,996
What better way than,
"black man makes good?"

594
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,781
He does makes a nice trophy
boy. You ought to be proud, skip.

595
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:50,698
Shut up, Bo.

596
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:54,272
[Journalist] Your commanding officer called
you one of the best pilots he'’s ever seen,

597
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,790
regardless of color.

598
00:42:55,964 --> 00:42:57,749
[Officer on pa]
Flight checks and fod walks

599
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,003
for fixed-wing and rotary
aircraft must be documented.

600
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,364
That'’s kind of him to say,
but I can'’t say I'’m special.

601
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,801
Well, it must be hard, right?

602
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:08,295
It must be hard being the only...

603
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:11,023
A naval aviator? Absolutely.

604
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:13,765
Landing planes on carriers,
it'’s the...

605
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:16,594
It'’s the toughest job there is
for anyone wearing wings.

606
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,295
[Officer on pa]
Heavy maintenance visit

607
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:24,210
will be performed
in all aircraft...

608
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:26,449
Come on, ensign brown.
You know what I mean. Jesse'’s fine.

609
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:27,996
Okay, Jesse.

610
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,105
There'’s a lot of guys
from different backgrounds,

611
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:31,478
but there'’s only one you.

612
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,292
There'’s only one
you, too, sir. [Chuckles]

613
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:36,439
Look, I mean no disrespect,

614
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,704
but I Don'’t think I'’m gonna say
what you'’re looking for me to say.

615
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,358
All right.

616
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:43,814
I worked hard
to fly these planes.

617
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:45,231
It'’s all I'’ve ever wanted to do.

618
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:47,205
Harder than I can
put into words.[Dick] Jesse.

619
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,496
Can we get a few more
pictures of Jesse in his plane?

620
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,030
I gotta get my pilots
back to work.

621
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,717
It'’ll just take
a minute, lieutenant.

622
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:54,675
Lieutenant commander.
Have a nice day.

623
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,068
[Sailor] Watch your back!

624
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,375
Damn, Jesse. You just put
a letter in the mail.

625
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:01,421
One a week.

626
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:02,988
That'’s what I told her.

627
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,879
[Carol] It'’s no use trying
to slow him down.

628
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:06,600
[Chattering]

629
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:09,037
Hey, we caught your
little circus act up on deck.

630
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:10,517
[Chuckling]

631
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,171
Your boy juggle, too? Or...

632
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:14,086
[Shoes tap]

633
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,348
[Laughs]

634
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:42,243
[Scoffs]

635
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:43,463
[Laughs]

636
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:46,074
Guess not.

637
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:50,775
[Marine scoffs] Well. Nice.

638
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,693
We should have stood
up to that asshole.

639
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:58,478
[Jesse] I'’m good, Tom.

640
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:09,228
Look, I'’m just saying we shouldn'’t
be letting him run his mouth like that.

641
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:38,039
[Carol sighs]

642
00:45:44,654 --> 00:45:46,935
[Dick] Now, I know that you'’re
all sick of doing busywork,

643
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:50,182
but, oh, have I got a
chore for a lucky someone.

644
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:51,923
Not it. Maintenance has replaced

645
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:53,533
a gyro on one of the corsairs,

646
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:55,547
I need a volunteer to
make sure all is working.

647
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:57,513
It'’s just a quick
up and down. I thought you said "lucky."

648
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:59,060
It sounds like a hoot.

649
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,627
Why Don'’t we give it to Fritz?

650
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:02,890
He could use the landing.

651
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:05,066
[All chuckling]I'’ll do it.

652
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:06,807
[Dick] All right.

653
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:09,114
Actually,

654
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:10,528
if you Don'’t mind, lieutenant,

655
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,118
lavery'’s right for once.

656
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:14,075
'’course I'’m right.

657
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,773
I could use the trap.

658
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:17,862
All yours.

659
00:46:18,036 --> 00:46:19,211
Heil herr mohring!

660
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,082
[Dick] Mohring it is.[Marty] all right.

661
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,650
All right, now as for
the rest of you,

662
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,347
command has ordered an audit

663
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:28,350
on serial numbers on parts
across all of the planes.

664
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,657
So while mohring is up
there enjoying the sightseeing,

665
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:34,139
the rest of you can validate
all of the serial numbers

666
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,532
on every single one of
these maintenance orders.

667
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:39,144
[All groaning]Thank you, Matthew.

668
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:40,798
Yeah.[Bo] uh, sir?

669
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,364
That'’ll take all day.

670
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,062
Only if you work quick.

671
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,930
[Flight officer] Ensign mohring,

672
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,345
you are clear to test the gyro.

673
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:30,673
2-17 to tower.

674
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,327
Gyro seems to be
in working order.

675
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,261
[Flight officer] Copy
that. Return to carrier.

676
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:51,085
Ensign mohring,
your approach is shallow.

677
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:53,261
I'’m correcting.

678
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,699
Manufacture number?

679
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,662
"P-5-5-1-8-4."

680
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:08,886
What is it?

681
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:18,765
[Breathing heavily]

682
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:21,089
[Jesse] Not gonna make the deck.

683
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,247
[Tom] He'’ll make it.

684
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,821
Just gotta slowly
pour on the power.

685
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:25,337
On this approach?

686
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:29,819
Better to wave off.

687
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:31,909
Try again.

688
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:34,563
[Flight officer on pa]
Crash crew, stand by.

689
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:35,956
Crash crew, stand by.

690
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,305
[Crew 3] Man your station.

691
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,528
Out of the way. Coming in.

692
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:44,182
[Inhales sharply]

693
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,535
[Flight officer on radio]
You'’re still low, mohring.

694
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:55,933
[Crew chattering]

695
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,371
Go around, pal.

696
00:49:00,894 --> 00:49:02,243
Ease it on, mohring.

697
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,194
[Flight officer] Ensign
mohring, give me some altitude.

698
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,210
[Grunts] No, no, no, no, no!

699
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:14,603
[Crashes]

700
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,217
[Grunts][Crew 5] he'’s in the water.

701
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:18,428
[Crew 6] Man overboard![Crew
7] get your vest pack!

702
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:19,521
[Crew 8] We need rescue!

703
00:49:19,695 --> 00:49:21,349
Poured on the power
too damn fast.

704
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:22,916
[Alarm blaring]

705
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,223
[Crash crew shouting]

706
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,794
[Crew] Let'’s go, let'’s go!

707
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:33,971
[Crew 8] Do we pull him out?

708
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,276
[Alarm continues]

709
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:59,300
Some people are gonna tell you
that this is what you signed up for.

710
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:01,607
It'’s not.

711
00:50:03,174 --> 00:50:04,566
Let'’s be real clear.

712
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,960
We lost a friend.

713
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:08,353
And that is not easy.

714
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,919
Now,

715
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:12,879
the Navy'’s gonna do
what the Navy does.

716
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:14,575
But, um...

717
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,056
I'’ll write his family.

718
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,980
Send them his things.

719
00:50:42,648 --> 00:50:43,736
[Sighs]

720
00:50:48,436 --> 00:50:49,872
The guys are getting together.

721
00:51:08,021 --> 00:51:09,477
Just because you think
you know better

722
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:11,459
doesn'’t mean you
have to say anything.

723
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,985
What are you talking about?[Sniffles]

724
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,162
Carol hadn'’t been in
the water five seconds

725
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,656
before you were talking about
what he could'’ve done better.

726
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,726
We all make mistakes.
That could'’ve been me, that...

727
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:28,563
Don'’t let that ring
convince you otherwise.

728
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,777
What'’s the one thing they
told us about the corsair?

729
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,674
Remind me. What'’d they
tell us about the corsair?

730
00:51:32,698 --> 00:51:34,003
You can'’t punch the throttle.

731
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,136
Mistakes get us killed, Jesse.

732
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,924
You Don'’t die if you
do what you'’re told.

733
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:44,840
[Marty] Fellas.

734
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,409
You coming?

735
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,378
To Carol.

736
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:39,634
[Tom] We'’re not even at
war, and we'’re losing men.

737
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:42,115
Good men.

738
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:46,656
It'’s just a
tough pill to swallow

739
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:48,165
when there'’s nothing to blame.

740
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,260
The swim test
in flight school...

741
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,225
They made me do it ten times.

742
00:53:11,927 --> 00:53:14,234
Didn'’t believe that
a nigger could swim.

743
00:53:16,628 --> 00:53:18,282
They dumped ice in the water.

744
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,461
Put weights in my flight suit.

745
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,379
Held me under.

746
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:35,299
They wouldn'’t have cared
if I died in that pool.

747
00:53:38,476 --> 00:53:39,955
But every time...

748
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:43,655
I made it out.

749
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,452
Got used to flying
the bearcat. [Chuckles]

750
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:01,890

The deck on approach.

752
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:07,461
[Sniffles] All right
in front of me.

753
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:10,334
I could land it on
my front yard if I had to.

754
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,080
But the corsair...

755
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,350
I can'’t see anything.

756
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:31,006
You have to rely on the lso.

757
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:33,451
[Jesse] Hard to believe
that the lso

758
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:35,968
won'’t crash my black ass
on purpose.

759
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:41,948
I can'’t tell you how many times

760
00:54:41,974 --> 00:54:43,715
people have told me
to give up, quit.

761
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,021
Die, even.

762
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:51,679
That'’s why you can'’t always
do what you'’re told.

763
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:57,598
If I did, I wouldn'’t be here.

764
00:55:01,994 --> 00:55:03,038

765
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:08,305
That'’s something
I was trying to teach mohring.

00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,443
[Sniffles]

767
00:55:42,469 --> 00:55:43,601
[Dick] You guys are tired.

768
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,907
I see it. Hell, I am, too.

769
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:47,431
Been a rough few weeks.

770
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:51,217
Fortunately,
we are docking in cannes

771
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:52,958
for a little shore leave.

772
00:55:53,132 --> 00:55:54,742
Now, I Don'’t know about you,

773
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,720
but I think some fresh air
would do all of us some good.

So please, Marty,
please, dear god,

778
00:56:06,624 --> 00:56:08,669
Don'’t do anything stupid.Mm-hmm.

779
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:10,889
Oh, and, uh, no,
I Don'’t wanna come with you

780
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:12,780
and do whatever is it
that you'’re gonna do,

781
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:13,848
but thank you.[Chuckles]

782
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:15,546
Go away.

Don'’t let cevoli catch you
selling those to the locals.

786
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,599
Let me tell you something.

787
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,646
I'’ve been in the Navy
since I was 16.

788
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,126
And our line of work
is a dangerous one.

789
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,824
One where tomorrow
is never promised.

790
00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,958
Hell, tomorrow'’s barely
a gentleman'’s agreement.

791
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,830
So if there'’s Liberty
to be had... [chuckles]

792
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,832
then Liberty we should take.

793
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:43,791
At two dollars a pack,
I'’ll take a risk.

Few too many sailors
on this street.

street with a whorehouse on it.

we find, then.

Tom. I'’m good.[Marty] hey, hey.

1056
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:57,149
I... I know.

1057
01:09:57,323 --> 01:09:58,692
Yeah, but you won'’t be
after I'’m done with you.

1058
01:09:58,716 --> 01:09:59,934
[Grunts]

1059
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:02,154
- [Marty] Back up! Tom!
- [Buddy] Come on!

1060
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:03,895
Come on! Oh, sorry.

1061
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:05,307
[Bill] Tom!
There'’s someone there.

1062
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:06,985
[Tom] Come on! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1063
01:10:07,159 --> 01:10:09,399
[Peters] Come on!
Let go of him! Hey! Hey![Whistle blows]

1064
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:11,183
[Bo] Come on, boys,
we gotta go! Stop! Stop!

1065
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,228
- [Bo] Come on! Let'’s go! Run!
- [Marty] We gotta go. Run!

1066
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,645
[Tom] Ah, shoot, your wings.

1067
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:16,318
- [Marty] Y'’all lucky!
- [Buddy] Let'’s go!

1068
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:17,342
Hustle, ladies!

1069
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,693
Oh, um. [Laughs]

1070
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,218
Tom, come on!
Tom, that way! That way!

1071
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,871
Oh, god! Go, go, go!

1072
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:29,050
[Siren wailing]

1073
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,404
[Tom] You know
how I do that trick?

1074
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:36,971
I eat the cigarette.

1075
01:10:38,712 --> 01:10:40,236
You didn'’t have to do that.

1076
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,455
I got the kiss.

1077
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:45,937
I wish you hadn'’t hit him.

1078
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,767
You would'’ve done
the same for me.

1079
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:00,821
Not hunting for a thank you.

1080
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,519
You were hunting
for a fight though.

1081
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:04,129
Defending my wingman.

1082
01:11:11,005 --> 01:11:12,703
I can fight my own fights.

1083
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,228
Been doing it
for a long time now.

1084
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,111
Jesse brown.

1085
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:32,331
Squadron of one.

1086
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,254
Ready room. Asap.
Something big'’s going down.

1087
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:44,430
[Grunts]

1088
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:50,218
[Sighs]

1089
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:54,397
[Dick] I hope that you all
had fun last night,

1090
01:11:54,571 --> 01:11:58,749
because the north Koreans
came pouring over the 38th parallel.

1091
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:00,272
They have taken Seoul.

1092
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:02,326
If they take the rest of
the southern peninsula,

1093
01:12:02,448 --> 01:12:05,408
it'’s on to Japan, and there go
our efforts to contain communism,

1094
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:06,670
so says Washington.

1095
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:08,454
So, what does that mean for us?

1096
01:12:08,628 --> 01:12:09,628
It means we'’re up.

1097
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,110
We'’re setting sail for Korea.

1098
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:13,851
Now, I know that
for almost all of you,

1099
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:16,332
this will be the first time
you'’re seeing combat.

1100
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:18,769
Your training is important, yes.

1101
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,424
And you are sure as hell ready
to do what you need to do.

1102
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:22,990
I made sure of that.

1103
01:12:23,164 --> 01:12:25,384
But the most
important thing is this:

1104
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:27,168
We bring everyone home.

1105
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:31,042
We bring everyone home.

1106
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:44,360
[Dick] Brass is worried there may
be as many as 100,000 Chinese

1107
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:48,015
already in North Korea, ready to
take up the fight at a moment'’s notice.

1108
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:50,670
MacArthur ordered b-29'’s
to take out two Bridges

1109
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:53,020
along the yalu river,
on the border,

1110
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:56,154
hoping to slow the Chinese
from sending in any more troops.

1111
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:57,329
But they missed.

1112
01:12:57,503 --> 01:12:59,636
So, I will lead the fighting 32.

1113
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:02,465
We will take out the
antiaircraft in sinuiju city.

1114
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:04,771
Tarsiers, you will fly support
for the panthers

1115
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:07,600
until it is safe for them to come
in and bomb those Bridges.

1116
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,646
This is just a friendly
reminder, gentlemen.

1117
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:12,388
Don'’t shoot or bomb anything
on the Chinese side of the river,

1118
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,433
unless you wanna be
personally responsible

1119
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:16,435
for starting another world war.

1120
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:18,872
We'’re flying directly
into gunfire.

1121
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:20,221
I need everyone sharp.

1122
01:13:20,874 --> 01:13:21,875
Be smart.

1123
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:23,790
Be ready.

1124
01:13:23,964 --> 01:13:25,009
[All] Yes, sir.

1125
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:33,234
[Engines roaring]

1126
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:45,551
[Dick] 201 to 205. You there?

1127
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:47,205
[Tom on radio] Go ahead, 201.

1128
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:49,313
I seem to be having some trouble
with my landing gear.

1129
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:50,382
Can you confirm?

1130
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:53,516
[Tom] Your gear is in transit.

1131
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:56,040
Uh, 201 to rug.

1132
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:58,774
We got a mechanical issue, and
can'’t lead us to the mission area.

1133
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,697
Passing the lead to 205.

1134
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:03,569
[Leyte cic on radio] Roger, 205.
You are cleared for the downwind.

1135
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:10,097
Stay on the right side
of the river, Tom.

1136
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:11,751
Yes, sir.

1137
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:37,385
[Engines roaring]

1138
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:44,523

[Breathes heavily]

1140
01:15:08,416 --> 01:15:11,507
[Breathes deeply]

1141
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,944
205 is in hot.

1142
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:32,092
[Artillery zipping]

1143
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:40,013
[Grunts]

1144
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:54,506
[Tom] 205 to flight.

1145
01:15:55,986 --> 01:15:57,640
Commencing flak suppression now.

1146
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,991
- Ah!
- [Gasps]

1147
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:02,470
[Jets roaring]

1148
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:03,645
It'’s a mig!

1149
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:09,869
Koenig, take goode and lavery.
Stay on the aa.

1150
01:16:10,043 --> 01:16:10,783
We'’re on it.

1151
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:12,263
Jesse, break left.

1152
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:13,437
Let'’s hose this guy.

1153
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:14,570
Roger that!

1154
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:18,225
Happy hunting.

1155
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:19,575
It'’s Bo time.

1156
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,589
Three good hits.

1157
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:35,808
Coming around for another
run on the aa.

1158
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:46,471
See him?[Jesse] negative.

1159
01:16:47,037 --> 01:16:48,081
I got nothing.

1160
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:56,786
[Engine roaring]

1161
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:58,744
[Machine guns firing]

1162
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:00,572
Bandit high! Bandit high! Huh?

1163
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:01,834
[Jesse] Break!

1164
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:17,023
Tom! He'’s on me pretty good!

1165
01:17:17,197 --> 01:17:19,417
I'’m gonna bring him to you
through the canyon.

1166
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:22,594
I say we show him
the lighthouse.

1167
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:23,769
Meet me in the middle.

1168
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:34,911
Enemy aa is silenced. I
repeat, enemy aa is silenced.

1169
01:17:35,085 --> 01:17:37,565
[Panther lead] Copy that, flight
leader. Approaching target now.

1170
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:43,006
[Breathes heavily] Oh!

1171
01:17:48,838 --> 01:17:51,362
[Grunts, breathes heavily]

1172
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:53,059
Come on.

1173
01:18:13,253 --> 01:18:15,560
[Tom] Okay,
I have a visual on you.

1174
01:18:15,734 --> 01:18:17,867
Break right,
up and hard on my call.

1175
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,477
Roger that!

1176
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:32,272
Ready, set...

1177
01:18:32,446 --> 01:18:33,839
Hit it![Groans]

[Shouts, laughs]

1180
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:43,066
Good hit, Tom!

1181
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,199
Quite fine, Jesse! Quite fine!

1182
01:18:50,856 --> 01:18:53,337
[Panther lead] This is panther
lead. Approaching target.

1183
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:11,485
[Explosion]

1184
01:19:15,968 --> 01:19:17,317
Good hit, good hit.

1185
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:19,537
Rear bridge is down.
Coming back around.

1186
01:19:22,975 --> 01:19:24,803
[Tom] Let'’s bring it home,
panthers.

1187
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:27,893
[Machine gun cocks]

1188
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:37,642
[Panther lead] Flight lead, we'’ve
got aa coming from the Chinese side.

1189
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:38,991
[Tom] We can'’t touch '’em.

1190
01:19:39,165 --> 01:19:40,776
Time to bug out.

1191
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,125
[Panther lead] Roger that.

1192
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:58,054
205, I still have ordnance.

1193
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,969
I can hit the bridge.

1194
01:20:00,143 --> 01:20:02,406
It'’s too much aa, 211.
Stand down.

1195
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:09,021
Jesse, stand down!
That'’s an order!

1196
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:28,345
[Exhales]

1197
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,493

[Grunts]

1201
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:30,973
That'’s a direct hit!

1202
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:33,366
That'’s a direct hit!
Bridge is down!

1203

[Bo] That a boy, Jesse!

1204
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:36,543
There we go, ace!

1205
01:21:36,717 --> 01:21:38,981
[Tom] Iroquois, this is 205.

1206
01:21:39,155 --> 01:21:40,939
Both Bridges have been
destroyed.

1207
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:42,680
Returning to ship.

1208
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:45,509
[Leyte cic on radio] Copy
that, 205. Good work.

[Sighs]

1210
01:21:58,174 --> 01:22:01,481
[Dick] Seems like I missed
one hell of a ride, huh?

1211
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:04,575
Intelligence has confirmed that that
rat line has been crippled. Well done.

1212
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:05,790
[All cheer]

1213
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,574
Now, we are all
still on standby,

1214
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:11,535
but everybody go get yourselves
cleaned up for some chow.

1215
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:14,973
[Tom] Well... [Clears throat]

1216
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:17,547
[Marty] Let'’s go, boys.
Let'’s get some food. Good job, Tom.

1217
01:22:20,587 --> 01:22:21,937
Here'’s the mission report.

1218
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:23,939
Well done, hudner.

1219
01:22:25,592 --> 01:22:26,593
How you feeling?

1220
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:28,813
Good.

1221
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:32,425
Hmm.

1222
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:34,123
Sit down.

1223
01:22:35,646 --> 01:22:36,647

That'’s the mundanity
of a job well done.

1228
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:01,280
You know how many wars there
have been in the history of mankind?

1229
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:04,631
No, course not.

1230
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:06,938
'’cause most wars are forgotten.

1231
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:08,418
All the men who fought in '’em,

1232
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:11,421
and all the medals they won.

1233
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:13,945
Heroes and hardware fade
to the back of the history books

1234
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:16,252
because it'’s not about war.

1235
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:19,429
This war never ends, there'’s
no v day, there'’s no finish line.

1236
01:23:20,908 --> 01:23:23,041
The real battle in all of life

1237
01:23:23,215 --> 01:23:25,043
is being someone
that people can count on.

1238
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:29,047
And that isn'’t defined
in a single moment.

1239
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:31,702
You earn that with
a lifetime of showing up.

1240
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:36,881
These conflicts, they Don'’t define
you, Tom. You Don'’t want '’em to.

1241
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:38,056
Trust me.

- Go get something to eat.

1243
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:44,497
Go on.

1244
01:23:50,808 --> 01:23:51,852
Hey, Tom.

1245
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,030
What'’s the most
important thing?

1246
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:58,120
Bring '’em home.

1247
01:23:58,642 --> 01:23:59,686
You did.

1248
01:24:41,598 --> 01:24:43,817
[Marine] Sir,
that is absolutely true.

1249

1251
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:06,753
You know what else I could use?

1252
01:25:06,927 --> 01:25:08,451
[Peters] Warm blankets?

1253
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:11,193
Fire?

1254
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:13,238
The sun, maybe?

1255
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:16,372
Another shot with Liz Taylor.

1256
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:19,244
Oh, Jesus! Buddy,
you gotta stop saying that.

1257
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,203
[Scoffs]
You never had a shot with Liz.

1258
01:25:21,377 --> 01:25:23,030
Uh, you weren'’t
paying attention.

1259
01:25:23,814 --> 01:25:24,815
[Sighs]

1260
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:26,295
I would take feeling in my toes

1261
01:25:26,469 --> 01:25:28,340
rather than a shot
with Liz right now.

1262
01:25:28,514 --> 01:25:29,776
[Laughs]

1263
01:25:35,608 --> 01:25:37,219
You think
they'’ll hit us tonight?

1264
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:40,352
I would.

1265
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,095
You ever got anything nice
to say?

1266
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:48,882

[Gunshot echoes]

1276
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:39,324
What'’s going on?

1277
01:26:58,474 --> 01:26:59,794
Looks like
the mission report said

1278
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:02,260
I ignored my commanding
officer'’s orders.

1279
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:07,874
Well, you know
how this stuff works.

1280
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:09,615
I only wrote down what happened.

1281
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,969
I'’m glad that'’s what
you saw, lieutenant.

1282
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:21,671
It'’s what happened.

1283
01:27:28,155 --> 01:27:30,854
Look, what difference does
it make? We got the job done.

1284
01:27:37,426 --> 01:27:38,905
Insubordination.

1285
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:46,652
That'’s what they'’re putting
in my fitness report.

1286
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:55,317
Uh, no, cevoli'’s gotta
understand...

1287
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,836
It'’s coming from
above cevoli, Tom.

1288
01:27:57,010 --> 01:27:58,316
Skipper'’s already read it.

1289
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:05,980
Jesse, I didn'’t
want that to happen.

1290
01:28:06,063 --> 01:28:09,153
What did you want to happen,
Mr. Academy?

1291
01:28:16,378 --> 01:28:17,466
Sorry, pal.

1292
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:31,871
You really hamstringed
me on this one. [Chuckles]

1293
01:28:35,788 --> 01:28:38,008
I can'’t get promoted
with that on my report.

1294
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:49,324
You ever think we'’d see a mig?

1295
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:52,172
Hell, I thought goode was gonna
bail out all the way back to Brooklyn.

1296
01:28:52,196 --> 01:28:54,546
You'’re the one who shit his
pants when the mig swooped in.

1297
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:57,308
By the way, you changed your diaper
yet? Why Don'’t you come check?

1298
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,732
Yeah, we'’re lucky we made it
out alive the way you two shoot.

Eh, boy?

It helps.

1314

What'’s that?

1315
01:30:21,894 --> 01:30:23,722
Testimonies from the guys.

1316
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:27,117
Saying how the mission was
complicated, and you did the right thing.

1317
01:30:28,814 --> 01:30:30,903
It'’ll fix whatever remark
they put in your report.

There'’s a way things work

gonna understand.

my neck out for you.

for something stupid and dangerous.

[Marty] Same ones who hitched
a ride with us from quonset.

They'’re saying that
it'’s an unspeakable hell.

For every one marine,

1417

Bridges and rat lines.

all across our nation.

how you must... i'’m okay.

1634
02:05:31,306 --> 02:05:33,177
I was afraid of
coming here today.

1635
02:05:34,614 --> 02:05:36,441
More afraid than
I'’ve been in my life.

1636
02:05:38,095 --> 02:05:40,750
To face you knowing i... Tom, I appreciate
what you did.

1637
02:05:43,448 --> 02:05:44,580
And I hope you know that.

1638
02:06:01,945 --> 02:06:03,947
I was with Jesse before he died.

1639
02:06:06,907 --> 02:06:09,692
He was calm throughout it all.

1640
02:06:11,868 --> 02:06:13,435
I was with him to the very end.

1641
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:19,615
The last words out of
his mouth were for you.

1642
02:06:21,443 --> 02:06:22,749
He said,

1643
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:25,795
"just tell Daisy how
much I love her."

1644
02:06:30,234 --> 02:06:31,758
[Sighs]

1645
02:06:35,979 --> 02:06:37,807
I'’m sorry I couldn'’t save him.

1646
02:06:42,029 --> 02:06:43,770
Tom, that was never your job.

1647
02:06:45,859 --> 02:06:47,991
Never anyone'’s job
to save Jesse.

1648
02:06:51,081 --> 02:06:52,692
I asked you to be there for him.

1649
02:06:54,781 --> 02:06:56,130
And you were.

1650
02:07:25,899 --> 02:07:28,945
[Jesse] I'’m going to close now
and climb into the rack.

1651
02:07:30,294 --> 02:07:33,384
I honestly dread going to bed,
but I usually dream of you,

1652
02:07:33,558 --> 02:07:37,301
so I'’ll manage to make it until
we'’ll share our bed together again.

1653
02:07:40,130 --> 02:07:41,262
Darling,

1654
02:07:42,742 --> 02:07:44,178
pray that it'’ll be soon.

1655
02:07:45,483 --> 02:07:46,659
I have to fly tomorrow...

1656
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:50,488
But so far as that goes,

1657
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:52,142
my heart hasn'’t been
to the earth

1658
02:07:52,316 --> 02:07:54,449
since the first time
you kissed me.

1659
02:07:56,494 --> 02:07:57,887
And when you love me,

1660
02:07:58,061 --> 02:08:02,326
you send it clear
out of this world.

1661
02:08:09,507 --> 02:08:11,292
I'’ll write you
as soon as I can.

1662
02:08:13,076 --> 02:08:14,077
I love you forever.

1663
02:08:23,086 --> 02:08:24,348
Your devoted husband,

1664
02:08:26,133 --> 02:08:28,613
lovingly and completely yours.

1665
02:08:31,355 --> 02:08:32,530
Forever.
