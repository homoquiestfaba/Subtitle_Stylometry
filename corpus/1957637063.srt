00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:27,400
Okay. Come on guys.

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,120
Let's go!
Be ready in a sec.

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,410
Gonna be late for your first day.

12
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,580
I thought dad was taking us today?

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,898
He is.

14
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:35,664
I just don't want you to,

15
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:36,770
what were you just watching?

16
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,840
Nothing.
Huh?

17
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,560
So are you gonna pick us up after school today?

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,293
Uh huh.

19
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:47,870
(car horn beeps)
Oh, there he is.

20
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,703
Okay.

21
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:49,830
Wait, give me a kiss.

22
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,133
I love you. And I love you.

23
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,173
And I'll pick you up after school.

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,590
Daddy!

25
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,433
Hey baby.

26
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:00,884
Come here.

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,410
Oh, oh my gosh.

28
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,133
Oh, I missed you.

29
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,290
Hmm.

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,950
Yeah, I did.

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,800
Hey Grace.
Hi,

32
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,062
(receding footsteps)

33
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,310
All right, go.

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,390
Been a good girl?
(car door opens)

35
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,594
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:21,427
(car door closes)

37
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:22,951
Oh!
(giggles)

38
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,784
(thunder rumbles)

39
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:34,165
(door shuts, locks)

40
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,479
(tense music)

41
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:43,470
(water surges)

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,303
(thunder rumbles)

43
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,370
What else?
(heavy rain)

44
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,070
What do cats eat for breakfast?

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,560
I don't know. What do cats eat for breakfast?

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,897
Mice crispies.
(soft chuckle)

47
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:01,697
Hey Grace, what are you mad at me?

48
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,420
Yeah.
Why?

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm mad at you.

50
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,300
Why?
You were there for an hour.

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
Well I wanted to meet
I get to sit

52
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,040
in the front this time.
Your new teacher.

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
For an hour?

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,300
He's very cute.

55
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,308
(alarm blips)

56
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:14,817
(door bursts open)
(dramatic music)

57
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,196
Mom!
(bangs sides of van and car)

58
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,446
No!
Help us!

59
00:03:19,985 --> 00:03:21,169
No, go, go, go!
(shouting)

60
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,752
No, mom!
No, no!

61
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,305
No!
(dramatic music)

62
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,138
No!

63
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,137
No!

64
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,841
(door slams shut)

65
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,508
(tires screech)

66
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:43,136
Wait! Wait!

67
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,586
(shouting)
(banging)

68
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:46,419
You're not getting out.

69
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,179
And all the back doors without handles.

70
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,973
Let me out!
(banging)

71
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:52,115
(dramatic music)
Wait, wait!

72
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:54,782
What are you doing? Who are you?

73
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,846
Don't you remember.

74
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:02,139
(gasping)
(banging)

75
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,076
(dramatic music)

76
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,460
(truck bumps along)
(shouting)

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,293
(suspenseful music)
Clear back,

78
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,597
get out of this area here.

79
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:11,026
(indistinct chatter)

80
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:14,109
(heavy rain patters)

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,380
What are you doing, Hendricks?

82
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,530
Okay. Get back to me.

83
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,103
He's lubricating.

84
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,249
(thunder rumbles)

85
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,916
(engine throbs)

86
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,405
(door clunks)
Hey.

87
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,080
Good thing you wore "Obsession."

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,870
Oh please.

89
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,010
So what happened between

90
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,918
you too, anyway?
Tom!

91
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:43,751
Shut up!

92
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,146
Tell me.

93
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:51,090
Andi Manette, 35 years old, psychiatrist in town,

94
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,440
separated from her husband, abducted in a van,

95
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,410
half an hour ago, her and two daughters.

96
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,480
9-year-old Genevieve, 12-year-old Grace.

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,240
They attended school here.
Witnesses?

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,370
Parents, schoolchild.

99
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,031
Greave took their statement.

100
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:02,864
Greave?

101
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:03,840
He got here first.

102
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,666
(scoffs)

103
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,233
Got some more blood down here.

104
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,310
Whoever took 'em, took 'em hard.

105
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,830
All right, let's get the sample over to the lab.

106
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,960
See if we can get a blood type.

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,900
You two, go door to door.

108
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,978
See if any neighbors saw anything suspicious.

109
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:23,128
What, you think it's a money job?

110
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:23,961
It makes sense.

111
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:24,794
If you're looking for ransom

112
00:05:24,794 --> 00:05:25,850
you don't need to take all three

113
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,980
and you damn sure don't do it in broad daylight.

114
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,720
Well, maybe the guy's a nut?

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,750
You know, she's a shrink he's patient?

116
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,840
What you got, Greaves?

117
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,480
Got a guy over here, David Gerdler and a little girl,

118
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,090
nine years old. Mercedes Barnett,

119
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,450
both confirmed a blue van with a nose on it.

120
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,530
You know, one of them engine overs?

121
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,730
Yeah, yeah. I know what's talking about.

122
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,710
All right.

123
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,630
Suspect.

124
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,380
A white male, mid-20s,
(soft chuckle)

125
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,420
muscular, long blonde hair,

126
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,790
he's wearing jeans and a gray t-shirt with a logo on it.

127
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,490
It's says Cen Con or something.

128
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,820
Anyway, he scoots off with the mom and daughters

129
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,780
all struggling
(case thumps down)

130
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,350
and bloody in the van.

131
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,640
That could be anybody's blood.

132
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,950
Hey, did you say Cen Con?

133
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,630
Yeah. That's what she said.

134
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,080
C-E-N C-O-N.
Yeah, I know.

135
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,050
It's a gamers convention.

136
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,000
They launched my first game a couple of years ago.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,200
What was that? A ring?

138
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,440
What?
(rain hammers down)

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,130
In your pocket?

140
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,790
Oh. Yeah, I guess.

141
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,200
You guess. Can I see it?

142
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,033
What for?

143
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,293
So I can steal the damned stone. What do you think?

144
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,574
(indistinct radio chatter)

145
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:28,407
Here.

146
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,400
Ho-ho!
Nice!

147
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,410
That's not bad for a cubic zirconium.

148
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,239
Item 122, Home Shopping Network. I was gonna get one too.

149
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,489
(chuckles)

150
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,640
(tense music)

151
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,473
Baggy!

152
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,093
Give me that.

153
00:06:58,262 --> 00:06:59,163
Nice family.

154
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:05,413
(thunder rumbles)
Yeah.

155
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:09,270
(indistinct speech)
(distant siren blares)

156
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,400
I keep telling you those things are gonna kill us.

157
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,690
Tell me you found them, all right?

158
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,220
If I did, would I be up here ruining your dinner plans?

159
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,053
Gosh. That's okay.

160
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:18,173
I mean, you're gonna nail this perp right?

161
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,033
Yeah.

162
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,580
We're gonna nail the perp.

163
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,730
Yeah.

164
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,780
Honey, tell you what?

165
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,792
I'll meet you at home, okay? Give me a kiss.

166
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,625
(lips smack)

167
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,793
(door opens)

168
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:32,670
Now you're aware the victim's father is Tower Manette?

169
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,503
Yep.

170
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,830
And we're talking about an only child by his first wife.

171
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,990
Married to his second wife, Helen Manette.

172
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,660
Yeah, I got it right here.

173
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,493
That's right.

174
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,940
Now, what about Andi Manette's husband, George Dunn?

175
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,880
It's strange.

176
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,750
We know he wasn't in the van,

177
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,690
but he's got some questions to answer.

178
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, he's gonna have to wait

179
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,433
'cause I promised Manette you'd meet with him immediately.

180
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,820
Why don't you go ahead and meet him.

181
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,653
I've gotta go-

182
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:54,530
It'll take a minute.

183
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,900
Come on. Just meet with this guy and make nice.

184
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,950
Who knows? He might be able to help us?

185
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,815
Do it for me, all right?

186
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,815
(sighs)

187
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,750
You know your husband said "perp."

188
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,300
Yeah, I know, but I love him.

189
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:13,590
I wanted us to meet privately first

190
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,740
without the women present.

191
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,700
I understand.

192
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,930
First of all, is there anything I can do?

193
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,470
A reward, an appeal?

194
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,330
Well, we're waiting to see

195
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,640
if there's any type of ransom demand first.

196
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,600
Can you think of anyone

197
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
who might wanna get at you or Mrs. Manette?

198
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,220
I've got more enemies than most men.

199
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,053
It's gotta be a dozen in this state

200
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,744
who blame me for destroying their careers.

201
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,670
Well, right now in the case doesn't even seem logical,

202
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,330
let alone political.

203
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,170
So is it possible we're dealing with someone who's insane?

204
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,628
Frankly, that is the thing that scares me the most.

205
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:43,750
(clock chimes)

206
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,540
You see, Andi treated the worst of the worst.

207
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,080
Sex criminals, psychopaths.

208
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,330
We're getting a search warrant to go through her files.

209
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,110
Lydia Wolf, the young woman with my wife

210
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,943
is Andi's partner.

211
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:55,770
I'm sure she'll help in whatever way is necessary.

212
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,160
What about your daughter's husband?

213
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,080
What about him? He's scum!

214
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
Tower.

215
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,170
Mrs. Manette. We were discussing George Dunn.

216
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,960
What about him?
He's a snake.

217
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,040
Tower, relax.
(coughs)

218
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,010
Everything's gonna be fine.

219
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,460
My husband has had some health problems recently.

220
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,780
Well, we'll keep you apprised.

221
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
That's fine. That's fine.

222
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,540
But I want my daughter and my grandchildren back.

223
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,223
I expect that you will do whatever it takes?

224
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,853
I trust you to understand that, Chief Davenport?

225
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,390
(horn blares)

226
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,090
Do whatever it takes. What am I, a gun for hire now?

227
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,610
Well, you kind of put yourself

228
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,480
in that position didn't you?

229
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,130
I mean, you know your reputation.

230
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:43,517
I don't want anything to do

231
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,350
with these people or this case.

232
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,707
Give it to somebody else. I don't want-

233
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:47,583
No, I need you on this one.

234
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,210
I don't think Andi Manette or kids

235
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,943
stand a chance otherwise.

236
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,413
All right, so?

237
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,940
What happens if I do whatever it takes?

238
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,100
You all right with that?
(car purrs along)

239
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,650
Lucas, if it gets ugly, I don't wanna know about it.

240
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm like two years away from a gold watch.

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,290
So just find these people and make this go away.

242
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:14,207
(wiper blades swish)
(lighter clicks)

243
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:16,290
You know, I'd like to live to see retirement myself.

244
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,740
You gonna lose the cigarette?

245
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,193
Thank you.

246
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:27,337
(case rattles, bangs)
(uneasy music)

247
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:30,420
There's gotta be a way outta here.

248
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,557
Where are we?

249
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,413
I don't know.

250
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,270
Seemed like we were in that van for an hour.

251
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,853
Who is he?

252
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,060
God, it must have been 10 years ago.

253
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,210
I was doing my residency.

254
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,531
I was supposed to evaluate him.

255
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,224
(water drips)
(music threatens more)

256
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:56,641
He had done some, bad things.

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,943
John. Mail, John Mail.

258
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:07,133
But why is he doing this?

259
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,453
I don't know, baby.

260
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,840
Maybe he's just trying to scare mama?

261
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,557
'Cause I had him sent away.

262
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:18,728
(knocking sound)

263
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,917
What's he gonna do, mommy?

264
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:22,853
Come on, sweetie.
(door bangs open)

265
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:26,522
(ominous music)

266
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,743
Get out here.

267
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,370
All right, John. Come on, girls.

268
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,033
Not them! Just you.

269
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:40,900
All right. I'll be right back.

270
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,835
John is not gonna hurt me.

271
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:43,668
(hand slaps)
Ahh!

272
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:45,001
No.
Get back!

273
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,676
(door slams, locks)

274
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:54,509
No! Ah!

275
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,910
I've been listenin' to the radio.

276
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,310
They have no idea where you are or who took you?

277
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,485
Even got Davenport looking for you.

278
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,318
John.

279
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,960
You don't wanna hurt me. I took care of you.

280
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,490
Locking me up, is that haw you took care of me?

281
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,323
Let's see it.

282
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,112
What?

283
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,049
You know what I'm talking about.

284
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:15,969
No, I, I don't-

285
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:16,802
(grunts)
(blow lands)

286
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,870
(body hits floor)

287
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,703
Now, I'm gonna take
Mommy!

288
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:20,969
Care of you.
Mommy, no!

289
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:22,793
No! No!

290
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:23,626
No, oh!

291
00:12:24,558 --> 00:12:25,725
No, ugh! Stop!

292
00:12:27,097 --> 00:12:27,930
No! No!

293
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:32,074
(tense music)

294
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:33,017
Hey, Chuck. What do you got?

295
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,190
Let me get back at you. Hello Lucas.

296
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,880
Your man. He's down by the water and he doesn't wanna leave.

297
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,170
(insects chirp)
All right.

298
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,690
Hey how's Holly?
Good.

299
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,988
Good.

300
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:47,595
(chimes tinkle)
(insects chirp)

301
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,250
(water babbles)
(dog barks)

302
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,083
Mr. Dunn.

303
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,095
You must be Davenport?

304
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,720
Did you find them?

305
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,553
Not yet.

306
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,150
Listen. I, I need to ask you a few questions.

307
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,983
Yeah.

308
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,230
You've been separated from your wife

309
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,810
for about a year, right?

310
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,643
Yeah.

311
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,740
About that.
When was the last time

312
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,573
you saw her?

313
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,653
This morning?

314
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,930
I, I, I took my daughters to school

315
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,310
and I called her from the car.

316
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,793
How'd you describe your relationship?

317
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,030
I'm a suspect, aren't I?

318
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,730
You want a lawyer?

319
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,563
No.

320
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,970
Look what, what do you wanna know?

321
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,050
You know, I made a mistake.

322
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,210
I did a stupid thing.

323
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,503
I cheated on my wife once.

324
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,670
I've been trying to make it up with Andi,

325
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,733
but, you know, things haven't been going easy.

326
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,490
I don't know if you believe this or not,

327
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,350
but I love my wife and my kids

328
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,733
and I do anything to get them back.

329
00:13:54,425 --> 00:13:56,970
(sighs)

330
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,109
Or kill them for money if you couldn't, huh?

331
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:02,240
Hmm?
You know, for the record,

332
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,630
I don't need the money.

333
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,500
That's the difference between me and the rest of her family.

334
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,890
They don't look that bad off to me.

335
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,570
Yeah. Well, it's all part of the show.

336
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,560
The fact is Manette's broke,

337
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,520
except for a trust fund he set up

338
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,970
for my wife and my daughters.

339
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,780
No insurance?

340
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,780
Yeah, on me, and my daughters are the beneficiaries.

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
Are you satisfied yet?

342
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,700
I'll let you know when I'm satisfied, all right?

343
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,923
Davenport, I busted my hump to get all this.

344
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,620
Andi and I sacrificed everything to make sure this home

345
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,003
was comfortable and safe for those kids.

346
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:45,764
And I screwed it up.

347
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,053
It's the only thing I ever wanted and I screwed it up.

348
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,163
I could never hurt those kids.

349
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,180
So everybody has a motive except for you, right?

350
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,170
That bothers you. Doesn't it.

351
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,820
You wanna know what bothers me?

352
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,883
Hmm?

353
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,097
This.

354
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:15,680
(bag crackles)

355
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:20,286
(slow, soft music)

356
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,091
You gonna find them, aren't cha?

357
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,806
(insects chirp)

358
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:30,806
(music gets louder)

359
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,313
Yeah. No problem.

360
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:40,825
(cars sweep past)

361
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:55,004
(soft clunk)

362
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,873
(soft music)

363
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:35,171
(jumps)
Damn!

364
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,848
(chuckles)

365
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:38,765
You got me.

366
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,167
Hi.
Hey.

367
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,963
Promises, promises.

368
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:50,963
Come here.

369
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,375
Mmm. Mmm.

370
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:02,694
Whoa, hold this.

371
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:05,980
Stop. Stop!

372
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,279
(laughing)

373
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,112
Stop.

374
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:11,965
Come back, come back.

375
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,428
No, hold on. Hold on.

376
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,261
Hold on. I'm serious.

377
00:17:14,261 --> 00:17:16,056
Okay.
Okay.

378
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:17,579
Okay, I promise. I promise.

379
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,443
(laughs)

380
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:19,717
Stop. Stop.

381
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:20,730
Okay. Okay.

382
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,265
Okay.
Hey, hold on.

383
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:24,515
(chuckles)

384
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,430
Lucas. What's the matter?

385
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,975
Stop laughing.

386
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,058
(laughs)

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,833
All right.

388
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I, I've been thinking about some things.

389
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,793
Oh, really?

390
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:08,200
(soft chuckle)

391
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,900
Come on, I'm being serious.

392
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,642
Like what sort of things?

393
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,225
(gentle music)

394
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:24,913
(phone rings)

395
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,553
(sighs)

396
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,234
I have two surgeries tomorrow morning.

397
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:37,488
Yeah, um...

398
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:38,704
So.
I know.

399
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:41,594
Just gimme a minute. Okay?

400
00:18:41,594 --> 00:18:44,094
(phone rings)

401
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,026
(beeps)
Yeah?

402
00:18:55,026 --> 00:18:58,070
I'm gonna have to kill them, Davenport.

403
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,260
Who is this?
(tense music)

404
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,560
Who do you think?

405
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:02,697
I don't know.

406
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:04,133
Could be the garbage man for all I know.

407
00:19:04,133 --> 00:19:05,630
Andi Manette's got a birthmark

408
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,870
like a rocket on her lower back.

409
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,420
That sound like garbage to you?

410
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,300
You wanna tell me why?

411
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,250
You tell me why!

412
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,260
Look, don't make this a game, all right?

413
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,093
But you're so good at games.

414
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:18,120
Yeah. And I'll beat you.

415
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,233
No, you won't.

416
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,548
(phone clicks)
(dial tone)

417
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:24,894
(beeps)

418
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:27,394
(tense music)

419
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:35,373
(phone clatters on desk)

420
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,620
What are you waiting for? Time is running out!

421
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,360
Look, cops can't work together and sleep together, okay?

422
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,820
It just gets too intense!

423
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,311
What's wrong with intense?
(machinery hums)

424
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,811
(doors clunk)

425
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,427
Did you ask her? I got my tux.

426
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,450
(doors close)

427
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,610
Something bad happened?

428
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,660
He called me last night.

429
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,493
What did he say?

430
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,315
He wants to turn this into a game.

431
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:06,770
(phones ring)

432
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,830
Hi Eleanor. I'm deputy chief Davenport.

433
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,320
These are detectives Black and Vega.

434
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,130
We have a search warrant for Dr. Manette's office.

435
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,360
I'll get Dr. Wolf.

436
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,210
No how about this?

437
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,550
How about you show me the office first,

438
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,131
then you can get whomever you wish.

439
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:24,131
(indistinct chatter)
(phones ring)

440
00:20:25,046 --> 00:20:28,129
(receding footsteps)

441
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:32,910
Where are the files?

442
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,910
They're over here.

443
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:38,331
(distant siren)

444
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,643
Thank you.

445
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,453
There's a-gonna be some noise!

446
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,686
(door opens)

447
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:51,519
What are you doing?

448
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,352
I've got a subpoena,

449
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:55,210
a search warrant and a release from next of kin.

450
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,220
If you're referring to that lying sack of-

451
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm referring to George Dunn.

452
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,860
Andi Manettes husband and father of her two children.

453
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,870
All right. Let's just skim everything.

454
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,780
Get names and numbers,

455
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,630
look especially for references to violence.

456
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,213
Hey, you can't do that.

457
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:07,220
Ah-ah-ah-ah!

458
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,290
Don't do that.

459
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,416
You know, you'll set us back years with these patients.

460
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,249
Don't tell 'em.

461
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:14,310
I have to tell them, I'm responsible for them.

462
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,240
Wrong. I'm responsible.

463
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,500
And you'll inform no one without approval from me.

464
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,960
This is ludicrous.

465
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,000
Is it true you'll get half a million dollars in insurance

466
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,492
if Andi Manette dies?
(distant horn blows)

467
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,360
(keyboard clacks)

468
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,090
Who told you that?

469
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,590
Did George Dunn tell you that?

470
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,223
You haven't answered my question?

471
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,530
I'm calling my attorney.

472
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,535
(scoffs)

473
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,633
Boy. You are so smooth.

474
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,147
Yeah well, I was born with that talent.

475
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,491
Are you okay?
(tense music)

476
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:56,104
(water drips)

477
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:58,380
What did he do to you mommy?

478
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,503
I-I'm all right. I'm okay.

479
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:05,530
(knocking)

480
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,120
Oh God. Oh God.

481
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,579
(footsteps)

482
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,996
(door opens)

483
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,757
You, out.
(tense music)

484
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:19,604
Oh, oh no. No, no.

485
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,437
Oh, please.

486
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:21,360
Shut up!

487
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,736
Don't take her John, please.

488
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:24,469
Don't don't, no, please, John.

489
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,953
Please, I beg you. My baby.

490
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,562
Please, please don't do this.

491
00:22:27,562 --> 00:22:29,476
Please, John, I beg you.

492
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:30,890
I won't let, she won't get in the way.

493
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,885
I, I promise you. She won't get in the way.

494
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,802
I'll-
Shh!

495
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:36,872
Thank you.

496
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:40,029
(screams)
(thuds on floor)

497
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,279
Oh! No, please!

498
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:43,664
(overlapping shouts)

499
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,625
Wait! No!

500
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,202
(cocks pistol)

501
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:47,035
Huh?

502
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,946
I'm dropping her off at the mall, all right?

503
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:54,400
I wanna stay here.
Shut up!

504
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,197
She wants to go to the mall.

505
00:22:56,197 --> 00:22:57,280
Please. No!

506
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,434
Can I just button her coat?

507
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:03,211
Please.
Please?

508
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,581
No.

509
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:06,355
(tense music)

510
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:07,642
I wanna stay here!

511
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:08,475
It'll be okay.

512
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:10,630
Just be a good girl, he'll take you to the mall.

513
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,846
And you ask for a policeman and you tell them who you are!

514
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:15,106
And, and...

515
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:17,080
(door closes)
Mommy!

516
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,913
Mom!

517
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:20,954
No. No!

518
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,364
No, no!

519
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:24,531
(screams)

520
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,663
(sobs)

521
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:42,178
(cars whoosh past)

522
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,157
Hey, Hey!

523
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:54,458
(upbeat music)

524
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,650
(door closes)
Hey Lucas,

525
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,950
this one's gonna make ya a million bucks, man!

526
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,340
What's the story with this pendulum phase?

527
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,378
I keep on getting squashed.

528
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:03,250
(shouts from game)

529
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,230
It's a timing mechanism.

530
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,170
Take two steps back before you make the spring,

531
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,550
you'll land safely.

532
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,616
After that you're on your own.

533
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:11,066
Hey, listen, come on. I need to talk to you.

534
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:11,910
(door opens)
No problem.

535
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,030
Hey, Ice, watch the cash, huh?

536
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,190
Yeah.

537
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,023
(upbeat music plays in store)

538
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,660
Saw your mug in the news.

539
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,431
That shrink who got kidnapped.

540
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:25,264
(scoffs)
Yeah.

541
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,097
Listen, that's why I'm here.

542
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:26,930
I think the guy's a gamer?

543
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,763
Gamer?
Yeah.

544
00:24:27,763 --> 00:24:30,180
He called me last night, said he knew I was good at games.

545
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,235
Plus someone saw wearing a Cen Con shirt

546
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,068
when he made the grab.

547
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:34,380
Cen Con?
Mm-hmm.

548
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,421
Mid-20s, wiry build.
Hey!

549
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:38,389
Stop that,
Blond hair by-

550
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,112
What are you doing?
(banging)

551
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,986
Paloma, get out here!
Hang on.

552
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,153
(hissing)

553
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,727
The hell is going on?
He's crazy.

554
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:49,730
This guy asked to borrow my lighter

555
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,313
and he set this shirt on fire.

556
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:52,146
(tense music)

557
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:53,678
Cen Con! Where is he?

558
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:54,947
He just left.

559
00:24:54,947 --> 00:24:56,393
(dramatic music)

560
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:57,310
Hey!
Oh!

561
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,571
(indistinct shouts)

562
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:15,055
(traffic whooshes past)

563
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,230
(people chatter)
Hey Sloan, do me a favor.

564
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,700
Take my friend Ice here and have her look at

565
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,820
the composite of the Manette kidnapper, right?

566
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,980
Thanks.

567
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,990
Let's go.
Hey.

568
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,820
We got a problem.

569
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,160
Yeah, I got some news too.

570
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,570
Andi Manette's kidnapper described a birth mark.

571
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,970
And?

572
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,270
Only said it was on her lower back.

573
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,593
George Dunn confirmed it.

574
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,710
So, what do you have?

575
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,850
Darrell Eldis, senior VP at Jerrell International.

576
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,593
Molests little boys in the scout troop he supervises.

577
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,740
Andi Manette's treating child molesters?

578
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,420
She and her partner, both.

579
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,840
And from what we've seen of the files,

580
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,593
none have been reported to us.

581
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,160
We know the names of the little boys?

582
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,750
No, but I can get the guys from sex on it.

583
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,583
Uh-huh.

584
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,750
By the time all the legal matters are settled

585
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,693
Andi Manette and her daughters are dead.

586
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,860
What do you want me to do?

587
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,087
Just keep looking. Find me a suspect.

588
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:21,210
(indistinct chatter)

589
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,043
Hey Cheryl.

590
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,485
Listen, I...

591
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,601
Thanks.

592
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:35,351
(people chatter)

593
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,090
What, you expect me to just ignore this?

594
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,720
Not ignore it. Just, just gimme a couple of days.

595
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,820
All these guys out touching little boys.

596
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,030
He's supposedly in recovery.

597
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,090
Oh, Lucas!

598
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,660
Look, Marie, I don't like this anymore than you do!

599
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,400
Okay. Let's say we arrest this guy.

600
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,433
By sunset we're knee deep in lawsuits.

601
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,183
Marie, I'll personally take down this guy.

602
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm just asking you for a shot at the kidnapper first.

603
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,100
Well make it fast.

604
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,910
I brief the Manette family this morning.

605
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,933
We could use some results.
(door opens)

606
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,177
(door clunks shut)
Lucas.

607
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,594
What d'you think?

608
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:25,150
(phone rings)
Hmm.

609
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,903
It could be him.

610
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:28,190
It could be Elvis.

611
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,330
All right, get it out to the uniforms.

612
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,190
Also gimme a guest list of the Cen Con convention.

613
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,610
Yo Lucas, you got a call here

614
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,540
from a Dr. Roderick from Iberia.

615
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,653
Start a trace!
(tense music)

616
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,550
Kidnappers, duh?

617
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,040
(handset clatters)

618
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,600
8th century Visigoth king in Spain,

619
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,807
conquered by the Moors of 711 AD.

620
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:52,310
I didn't think you'd remember that.

621
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,127
Opposing sides of my first game. Yeah, I remember.

622
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,790
(slams down phone)
Lucas, Lucas!

623
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,375
What the hell you doing?

624
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,208
All right, stay on your toes.

625
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,050
He's not gonna stay on the line long.

626
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:07,734
(tense music)
(phone rings)

627
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,143
How does it feel?

628
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:13,310
What'd you hang up on me for?

629
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,360
Because I'm busy.

630
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,193
Well, you better get unbusy

631
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,463
or the other two are gonna end up like the runt.

632
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,783
Hello?

633
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,163
Got time for me now?

634
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,220
What'd you do to Genevieve?

635
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,770
Go eat at Nethinim's Davenport.

636
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,150
You'll get your answer there.

637
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,290
Come again?
Sorry.

638
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,790
One chance per customer.

639
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,585
And you were lucky with that Cen Con shirt.

640
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,669
(phone clicks)
(dial tone)

641
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:37,606
(phone clatters)

642
00:28:37,606 --> 00:28:38,439
(tense music)
Not enough time, Lucas.

643
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:40,410
How come we still don't have caller ID?

644
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,193
How did he know we IDed the shirt?

645
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,861
What's a Nethinim?

646
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:46,600
It's in the Bible. Nehemiah.

647
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,162
Yeah, I knew that.

648
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:49,100
Shaw, get me a Bible.

649
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,110
Somebody get him a Bible.

650
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,210
C'mon guys, a Bible. Let's go, let's go!

651
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,733
Lucas, Lucas!

652
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,821
(indistinct chatter)

653
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:09,290
"Moreover, the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel,

654
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,670
unto the place over against the water gate toward the east,

655
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,701
and the tower that lieth out."

656
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:17,256
(tense music)

657
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,777
You can see those water towers from the river

658
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:21,077
and the water gate might be one of those dams.

659
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,210
All right, call the precincts.

660
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,640
Have 'em check out those towers.

661
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,490
Check for what?

662
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,950
A 9-year old girl.

663
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,909
All right guys. Come on, come on, let's go.

664
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:32,459
Let's go, pick up. C'mon, move!

665
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,516
(ominous music)

666
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:38,016
(water drips)

667
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:44,353
Mom.
(whispers)

668
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:46,103
What are we gonna do?

669
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,013
We have to fight him.

670
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,963
We have to find something that we can fight him with.

671
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,313
We have to find something that we can hurt him with,

672
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:01,146
because...

673
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:06,158
Now I have to hurt him with something.

674
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:10,465
Gotta find something.

675
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:16,542
Oh, Gracie, come here!

676
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,444
Here's a nail.

677
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:21,004
Something we can-
(clunking overhead)

678
00:30:21,004 --> 00:30:21,837
Go back!

679
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:28,778
(tense music)
(door opens)

680
00:30:33,476 --> 00:30:36,060
(trays slide on floor)

681
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,313
Where is my daughter?

682
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,130
I dropped her off at the mall.

683
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,970
I don't believe you, I don't believe you.

684
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,470
Told her to call the cops and ask for Davenport.

685
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,560
You've said that name before.

686
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,610
Davenport. Oh yeah.

687
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,330
He's my buddy, thinks he's a gamer.

688
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,060
I got him beat.

689
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,149
Are you afraid of him?

690
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,732
(tense music)

691
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,263
I'm not afraid of anyone.

692
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:12,263
(water drips)
(tense music)

693
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,030
(door slams, locks)

694
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,439
This is it. Get this nail off here.

695
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,470
Must have been 2,000 gamers

696
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,860
at that Cen Con convention.

697
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,683
Yeah, I know. Just do the best you can, okay?

698
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,070
What about chat rooms?

699
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,940
I could search the net for him?

700
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,800
Was it Rodney?

701
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,260
No. Roderick.

702
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,460
Is that his real name?

703
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,545
King Roderick is one of the names I used in my first game.

704
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:51,680
That's all we have to go on, so.

705
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,227
I'll hit some bulletin boards. See if I get any nibbles.

706
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:55,060
(phone rings)

707
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,160
Hey, Ice. Be careful, all right?

708
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,137
I can handle 'em.

709
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,563
Yeah.

710
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,920
Lucas, listen, they got something downtown.

711
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,690
An oil drum under one of the water towers.

712
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,940
It's got your name on it.

713
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,733
What?

714
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:13,593
Yeah. "Lucas" is spray painted right on the side.

715
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,680
What's in the barrel?

716
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,513
We're not sure.

717
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:18,447
Robot did not think a bomb,

718
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,010
but it's full and it's heavy.

719
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,660
Gonna pull the lid from a distance, see what happens.

720
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,410
(robot whirs)

721
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,120
It's not explosives, but stay clear till the lid's off.

722
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,470
Okay, chief. We're ready.

723
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:36,233
(machinery whines)

724
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,515
All clear.

725
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:43,098
(tense music)

726
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,643
Oh, I don't do this.

727
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:52,184
It's not a little girl.

728
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:57,184
(barrel clangs)
(water gushes)

729
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,123
Some sense of humor.

730
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,692
(phone rings)

731
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:09,020
Yeah?

732
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,620
Damn, you're fast Lucas.

733
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,670
Can I call you Lucas?

734
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:13,958
Yeah, sure.

735
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,137
What can I call you?
(tense music)

736
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:17,340
You can't.

737
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Then how are we supposed to talk, huh?

738
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,110
I mean, you can see me, right?

739
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,213
You see I'm trying to work with you here, right?

740
00:33:26,611 --> 00:33:27,860
Huh?

741
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,909
Come on. Where's the challenge, huh?

742
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,700
I mean, you're just acting like somebody who's sick.

743
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,740
Sick. Think I'm sick?

744
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,610
I mean, you know, maybe I can help

745
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,780
get you fixed.
Hey man, I've been fixed!

746
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,480
The best and the brightest strapped me to a table

747
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,560
and fixed me real good.

748
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,741
So don't tell me how you're gonna fix things!

749
00:33:41,741 --> 00:33:44,955
(hangs up phone)
(dial tone)

750
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:47,555
(sighs)
(phone beeps)

751
00:33:47,555 --> 00:33:50,805
(police radio chatter)

752
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:56,963
(footsteps on game)

753
00:33:56,963 --> 00:33:59,164
So what's got your far in a bunch?

754
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,345
(coughs)

755
00:34:01,345 --> 00:34:04,411
(fighting sounds)

756
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,661
(shouting)

757
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:11,153
Mail!

758
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,606
(taps keyboard)

759
00:34:17,606 --> 00:34:19,875
You are trying my patience.

760
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:24,333
The doll in the barrel, the phone calls to Davenport.

761
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,215
I told you I wanted this finished.

762
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:28,694
(tense music)

763
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:31,361
(keyboard taps)

764
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,033
Then get ready. You don't have much longer.

765
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:40,734
Bite me.

766
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:47,605
(ominous music)

767
00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:52,481
(door opens)

768
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
(sighs)

769
00:34:59,899 --> 00:35:04,899
(water splooshes)
(dishes clatter)

770
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:09,798
It's been 48 hours

771
00:35:09,798 --> 00:35:12,432
and I'm still no closer to solving this thing.

772
00:35:12,432 --> 00:35:14,515
(scoffs)

773
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:18,830
Do you think they're still alive?

774
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:24,293
(car horn beeps)

775
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,897
There's more to this case, isn't there?

776
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,110
Andi Manette's treating child abusers.

777
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,530
Vega and Black found three cases so far.

778
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,710
Oh my God. What'd you do?

779
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,550
Nothing yet.

780
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,743
I just went through the files.
You did nothing?

781
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,240
I don't understand.

782
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,740
It's privileged information.

783
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,110
Look, I handle this thing the wrong way,

784
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,390
a bunch of perverts get a free ride,

785
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,490
not to mention I scare off this kidnapper.

786
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,370
I'm sorry. I just...

787
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,793
I thought that there were some things

788
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:11,918
that were more important than solving a case.

789
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,354
Don't you think I know that, Weather?

790
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:14,863
Well, you don't act like it.

791
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,510
Every time you get on a case, you just...

792
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,290
You just get further away from me.

793
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,660
What are you talking about?

794
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,060
Let me ask you a question.

795
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,110
If you and I were to have children, okay?

796
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,930
Hypothetically. 'Cause I don't want you to freak out.

797
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:37,270
But if you and I were to have children,

798
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,943
would you jeopardize them in order to solve a case?

799
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm trying to stop some crazy guy

800
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,700
from killing a woman and her kids.

801
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,943
That's my job.

802
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:57,093
And I do whatever I have to do to do that job.

803
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,720
I just wish that you had this kind of commitment

804
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,263
in other areas of your life.

805
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,340
I'm gonna finish everything up in the morning.

806
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,423
(receding footsteps)

807
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,817
(ominous music)

808
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:38,734
(taps on keyboard)

809
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:02,036
(indistinct speech)

810
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,550
You getting anything?

811
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,990
Yeah. Some kid into sex and aggression.

812
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,240
Think he scared her.

813
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,890
Listen, substantial maladjustment,

814
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,440
severely abused, channels rages through sex,

815
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,440
extremely violent and severely claustrophobic?

816
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,943
Men are so screwed up.

817
00:38:26,248 --> 00:38:27,598
I can tell you about men.

818
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,543
You know that young DA, Bucky?

819
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,293
Yeah.

820
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,710
I had this crush on him, you know?

821
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,847
And I didn't know, he had a crush on me, so,

822
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,380
we got together and we went out to dinner one night,

823
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,683
took me to The Garlic House.

824
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,787
I hate garlic.

825
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,503
And so I just had a salad, but oh God, my heart was.

826
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,010
And I walked him home and I was hoping we could stop

827
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,923
at a convenience store for breath mints.

828
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,913
I didn't find one. And we were gonna say goodnight.

829
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,753
And he was gonna kiss me. And his breath was, oh!

830
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,710
I said, you know, "Not on my first date, you know?"

831
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,900
I said, "I'll call you," and...

832
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:25,810
He never called.

833
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,760
He never called.

834
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh, he'll call!

835
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,820
No, I don't want him to call me.

836
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,223
I found out he's married!

837
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:32,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

838
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,733
That dog!

839
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,290
Listen, I wanna run a few of these downtown.

840
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,610
Yeah. Especially that last one.

841
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,550
That sex and aggression.

842
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,383
John Mail.

843
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:43,216
Yeah.
Okay.

844
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:45,690
Listen, don't tell nobody.

845
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,354
I won't. I'm sorry.

846
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:49,187
Bye.

847
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,220
Keep thinking you're right around the corner

848
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,380
but so far you're not even close.

849
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,984
Maybe I'm closer than you think.

850
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,850
Maybe you don't have a clue.

851
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,293
Oops. Gotta go.

852
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:07,332
(tape clicks off)

853
00:40:07,332 --> 00:40:08,240
And that's all she wrote.

854
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,085
What's the radio station playing in the background?

855
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:12,603
KXRT. Alternative rock.

856
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:17,590
(chuckles)

857
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,630
What you got, Black?

858
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,970
A couple of psychos. One I like a lot.

859
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,830
All right, tell me.

860
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,660
John Mail, 16 years old,

861
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,180
started out torturing neighborhood pets.

862
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,480
Blinding them, maiming them.

863
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,540
Moves on to girls at 14.

864
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,190
Arrests for indecent assault,

865
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,540
molestation, attempted rape.

866
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,800
And he's really claustrophobic.

867
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,927
Andi saw him 10 years ago so that puts him around-

868
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:40,760
26?
26, yeah.

869
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,380
Yeah, well run him down.

870
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,213
Okay.

871
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,640
Dunn said he called Andi in the car, right?

872
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,900
Yeah. So?

873
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,800
Was that on a car phone or portable?

874
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,360
You got anything?

875
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,901
Portable. Registered George Dunn.

876
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:02,901
(game music plays)
(characters shout, fight)

877
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:03,909
And now we're ready

878
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:05,810
to draw one more phone number and give it 10 rings

879
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,960
in our 93 Squeeze-
Got it, Davenport.

880
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,110
Let's see here, George Dunn.

881
00:41:12,187 --> 00:41:13,370
I'm gonna get you.

882
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,437
(phone rings on radio)
Come on Georgie.

883
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:17,210
(phone rings)
You're gonna need this, man.

884
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,073
Please be home. Let's dial him up.

885
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:23,891
(indistinct chatter)

886
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:25,308
KXRT. 93 squeeze.

887
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,005
Come on. That's four.

888
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:32,008
(helicopter rotor beats)

889
00:41:32,008 --> 00:41:32,841
(tense music)

890
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:34,470
Okay George Dunn, that's six.

891
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,615
Four more rings and we gotta move on.

892
00:41:36,615 --> 00:41:38,865
Nah, he's not gonna bite.

893
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:43,815
Hello.

894
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:44,850
That's him.

895
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,589
Go, go 160 southeast.

896
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:49,172
(blades throb)

897
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,583
Sloan, you got that?

898
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:53,965
We're on our way on 195.
(sirens wail)

899
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:55,959
He's gotta be in foreign country.

900
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,376
(cars roar away)

901
00:41:57,376 --> 00:42:00,034
(sirens blare)

902
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,213
All right. George Dunn!

903
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:03,200
This is Milo Sweet of KXRT

904
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,277
where we squeeze and you suck it up for $100,000.

905
00:42:07,252 --> 00:42:10,252
(dramatic music)

906
00:42:10,252 --> 00:42:12,845
Looks like he's between us.
(sirens wail)

907
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:15,762
(blades throbbing)

908
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,830
We squeeze a whole song into five seconds

909
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,900
and you get 10 and tell us what it is, okay, George?

910
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,604
Here it comes.

911
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:25,554
How far are we?

912
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:26,804
Closing fast.

913
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,480
You got 10 seconds, George.
50 degrees south.

914
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,439
Coming up, Lucas. Six miles east of Stillwater.

915
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,772
Come on. Come on, come on!

916
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,300
All right George. We need your answer.

917
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,350
That was "Travesty Lane" by the Sea Monkeys.

918
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,350
Nice try, Davenport.

919
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:49,287
Damn!

920
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,176
We almost had him, Lucas.

921
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:58,176
(siren wails)
(helicopter throbs)

922
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:00,840
Lucas. It's Black.

923
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,440
Yeah?
(solemn music)

924
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,480
Just so you know that

925
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,813
sex and aggression suspect, John Mail?

926
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,285
He's dead. Committed suicide six months ago.

927
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:20,069
(helicopter throbs away)

928
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:31,441
(heavy breathing)
(water drips)

929
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:49,383
What did you, what did you put in the food, John?

930
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,623
Let's see.

931
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,918
What did you give me?

932
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:58,669
What did I give you?

933
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,586
Ethylicine.

934
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,876
How does it feel to be on the other end of the needle?

935
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:05,209
Oh God! Grace.

936
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,237
Grace!

937
00:44:08,237 --> 00:44:09,140
Kinda scary isn't it,

938
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,940
when someone else has total control?

939
00:44:12,971 --> 00:44:15,563
I never hurt you, John.

940
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:16,913
Oh, yes you did.

941
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:21,690
God, please, John. I was trying to help you.

942
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,523
Yeah.

943
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:26,447
Well, that's what I wanted to believe.

944
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,140
Then I started getting those messages.

945
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:36,060
What, what messages?

946
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,893
Email.

947
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,100
I start getting flashes from someone.

948
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,493
Wants to know if I remember Dr. Manette?

949
00:44:47,139 --> 00:44:49,673
(tense music)

950
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:51,840
"The one who put you away.

951
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:56,550
You remember Dr. Manette?

952
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:00,679
She brags about you all the time.

953
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,903
How she locked you up.

954
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,871
How she made you scream."

955
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,704
No! Who?

956
00:45:11,274 --> 00:45:13,510
That's my little secret.

957
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,093
(tense music)

958
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,033
Remember how we used to share all our secrets?

959
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,460
You'd sit there in your doctor's chair.

960
00:45:29,718 --> 00:45:30,718
Tight dress.

961
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,280
Legs crossed.

962
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,147
But now you have all the power, John.

963
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:50,045
Uh-huh.

964
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:57,780
Except, he doesn't know what you're doing.

965
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,870
He doesn't know if I'm dead or alive.

966
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,526
Who's he?

967
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,310
Davenport.

968
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,160
So what?

969
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:10,720
So, if I made a phone call,

970
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,123
and if Davenport is the gamer you say he is,

971
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:18,840
knowing I'm alive will make his job lot harder.

972
00:46:22,343 --> 00:46:25,510
It'll give you power over him, John.

973
00:46:28,212 --> 00:46:30,712
(tense music)

974
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:33,408

Yeah?

1003
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
George? Daddy?

1004
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,083
It's, it's Andi.

1005
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,020
Grace and I are are okay.

1006
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,890
And, and we hope that Genevieve,

1007
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,850
we hope that she's all right?

1008
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,783
And that Aunt Lisa is feeling better.

1009
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,590
The man that is, is holding us won't let me say anymore,

1010
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:08,590
but, please do whatever he says so that

1011
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,060
so that we can come home, soon.

1012
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,080
I love you.

1013
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,530
She's sending us a message.

1014
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,450
Her Aunt Lisa, that's Lisa Farmer.

1015
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,193
She's been dead for 10 years.

1016
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,180
Tell me more.

1017
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,500
She was my first wife's sister.

1018
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,760
She had a big place in the country. A lot of horses.

1019
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,250
It's possible she's being held on a farm.

1020
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,140
Helicopter tracked his cell signal to Dakota County.

1021
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,103
The part about Genevieve. She's dead, isn't she?

1022
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,890
(birds tweeting)
(clock ticks)

1023
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,260
We're not sure.

1024
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,870
You've got real estate in Dakota County, don't you?

1025
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:47,817
So what? Huh?

1026
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:49,950
Are you accusing me of setting this up, huh?

1027
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:50,783
Huh?!

1028
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:57,167
I, I, I'm gonna put up a reward.

1029
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,853
$100,000. I'm gonna make an announcement right now.

1030
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:02,280
(coughs)

1031
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,763
Tower, you've got to lie down.

1032
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:11,683
You. Find this bastard.

1033
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:19,395
(suspenseful music)

1034
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:26,910
I, I presume you have checked his alibi?

1035
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:27,833
George's I mean?

1036
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:31,433
I mean, not that he couldn't have hired an accomplice.

1037
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,015
You think he could have done this to his own kids?

1038
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:37,723
No, no, no. No!

1039
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:44,683
I guess I wouldn't put it past him.

1040
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:46,403
I don't know!

1041
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:48,930
For that matter, I wouldn't put it past Lydia Wolf.

1042
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,740
If Andi were to die, Lydia, wouldn't just get the insurance.

1043
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,903
I mean, she, she'd actually get the entire practice!

1044
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,098
That Helen Manette was a piece of work, wasn't she?

1045
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:03,931
Yeah.

1046
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:06,015
It's probably 'cause Lydia Wolf's doing Tower Manette.

1047
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:06,848
How d'you know?

1048
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:10,060
The way she touches him. She's always touching him.

1049
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,270
Now Manette family members

1050
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,680
have declined our request for statements so far.

1051
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,790
Local authorities though,

1052
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,160
headed by deputy chief Lucas Davenport,

1053
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,097
ensure the safe return of Andi Manette

1054
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:21,920
and her two daughters, Grace and Genevieve.

1055
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,540
To that end authorities have released

1056
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,990
this police sketch
Mail.

1057
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,700
And they're asking anyone with knowledge of

1058
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,000
this individual's whereabouts
Mail.

1059
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,080
To contact them immediately.

1060
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,710
To date the investigation of this tragic crime

1061
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,925
has yielded few clues.
Mail.

1062
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,450
Andi Manette is one of the city's

1063
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,767
leading psychiatrists and her father, Tower Manette,

1064
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:42,501
one of the most influential power brokers.

1065
00:51:42,501 --> 00:51:44,372
Sources tell us that he's met privately with

1066
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:46,221
deputy chief Davenport
(taps on keyboard)

1067
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:48,527
to discuss the department's lack of leads.

1068
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:50,303
(tense music)
Finish them off!

1069
00:51:52,228 --> 00:51:55,145
(taps on keyboard)

1070
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,163
You're forgetting who put all this together.

1071
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:07,472
(types violently)

1072
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:11,760
Andi sent a message on that tape

1073
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,990
that you let her make.

1074
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,120
Her Aunt Lisa is dead.

1075
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,223
Davenport is searching Dakota County.

1076
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,383
You don't have much time.

1077
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:25,964
(tense music)

1078
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:43,185
I just keep digging, we'll get it out.

1079
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:44,535
How are you feeling, Grace?

1080
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,090
I dunno.

1081
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,225
I think the drugs have worn off.

1082
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:51,314
We're gonna get out here I promise you, Grace

1083
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:52,601
We are gonna get out of here.

1084
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:56,217
(banging)
(dramatic music)

1085
00:52:56,217 --> 00:52:58,693
Remember, no eye contact, head down.

1086
00:53:05,925 --> 00:53:08,341
(door bangs open)

1087
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:09,602
You tricked me!

1088
00:53:09,602 --> 00:53:11,388
No, John, I-
Come here!

1089
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,805
No, no, ow, no!

1090
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:16,903
Run! Ow!

1091
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,184
(body thumps)

1092
00:53:19,184 --> 00:53:20,676
(door clunks)

1093
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:23,590
(shouts)

1094
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,590
(top rips)
No, John!

1095
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,668
No!

1096
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:29,000
You got six more perfect files on your desk.

1097
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,240
But none of 'em as good as the sex and aggression, right?

1098
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,210
John Mail.

1099
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,680
He jumped off the Lake Street bridge

1100
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,610
the day after he got released from the mental ward

1101
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,778
over at St. Peters.
(people chattering)

1102
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:37,611
Let me ask you a question.

1103
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:39,200
How was his body IDed?

1104
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,610
The ME ran the dental,

1105
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:42,509
said his body was in the river about a week

1106
00:53:42,509 --> 00:53:44,479
when they finally_
Lucas!

1107
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:45,740
Okay.

1108
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,573
I got him.

1109
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,293
Tell me.

1110
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,126
Okay.

1111
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,360
There was a gamer at a D and D party

1112
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,020
who remembers meeting a guy named Roderick and some girl.

1113
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,920
He thinks that the girl was

1114
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,470
Roderick's girlfriend or something.

1115
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,980
But he said they were both really weird.

1116
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,840
Weird how?

1117
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,200
Well, he kept talking about what a genius he was.

1118
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,430
And she kept bragging about how many

1119
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,984
mental institutes she'd been in.

1120
00:54:02,984 --> 00:54:04,330
Okay, Ice, listen. Did you get her name?

1121
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,740
Yeah.

1122
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,723
Gloria Crosby.

1123
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:09,830
What about an address?

1124
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,190
Wow. Okay, thanks.

1125
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,990
Listen. You stay here with Detective Black, okay?

1126
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:17,823
Vega. Come on!

1127
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:19,607
Wait a second. I wanna come!

1128
00:54:19,607 --> 00:54:22,736
(busy chatter)

1129
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:24,840
(knocks on door)

1130
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,673
Who is it?

1131
00:54:25,673 --> 00:54:28,480
Lucas Davenport. Minnesota PD.

1132
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,963
(children playing)

1133
00:54:31,963 --> 00:54:33,573
Whaddya want?

1134
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:34,510
I wanna know if you've ever played

1135
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:36,260
Dungeons and Dragons with this guy?

1136
00:54:37,869 --> 00:54:40,202
(dog barks)

1137
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,440
I don't remember.

1138
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,920
Come on now, please, take another look.

1139
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,530
Maybe you met him at school at another

1140
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,280
party somewhere?
(dog clicks)

1141
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,890
Hm?

1142
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:55,723
What'd he do?

1143
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:57,810
(scoffs)

1144
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,150
The kidnapping?

1145
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,690
I saw this on the news.

1146
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,110
You're the cop.
Right.

1147
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:02,943
Listen.
I know you,

1148
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:05,360
you're a gamer.
Just help me out.

1149
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,793
A name, address, anything, please.

1150
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,993
I don't know.

1151
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:14,280
I, I put it on the net when I have these games

1152
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,510
and people just show up.

1153
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,190
So you're telling me you don't even know this guy, huh?

1154
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,603
He might have come once. But I don't remember.

1155
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,410
Huh. Elsium.

1156
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,693
Prozac.
They are prescription.

1157
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,323
I've got emotional problems.

1158
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,930
(pills rattle)
(banging)

1159
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,630
Let me tell you something. Come here.

1160
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:40,390
I, um, I find out that you know this guy

1161
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,690
and you're not telling me,

1162
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,173
you're gonna have more than emotional problems.

1163
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,143
Hmm?

1164
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,243
Here.

1165
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,500
Call me when the fog clears.

1166
00:55:58,212 --> 00:56:00,629
(door opens)

1167
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:05,537
(door closes)

1168
00:56:05,537 --> 00:56:08,037
(clicks lock)

1169
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:15,480
John, baby.
(soft chuckle)

1170
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,740
You did it.

1171
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,640
You really did it.

1172
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,948
(insects chirp)

1173
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:32,278
(slow footsteps)

1174
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:36,700
Hey John.
Hey!

1175
00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:41,920
(cocks pistol)

1176
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,920
How did you find me?

1177
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,210
You told me about this place

1178
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,273
when we were in St. Peter's, remember?

1179
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:58,080
Oh.

1180
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,953
Yeah. Right.

1181
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:03,740
Right.
(uncocks pistol)

1182
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,840
You got 'em here, don't you?

1183
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,520
That whore bitch doctor and her kids.

1184
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,653
You got 'em don't you?

1185
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,920
(sinister music)

1186
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,793
What's the matter, you don't trust me?

1187
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,160
You wouldn't even be here

1188
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,510
if I hadn't helped pull that little switcharoo.

1189
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:27,834
It's just. Not a good time.

1190
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:31,303
Come on, John baby.

1191
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,753
I wanna see her.

1192
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:38,527
I wanna see you hurt her.

1193
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:48,044
(chuckles)

1194
00:57:49,225 --> 00:57:50,058
All right.

1195
00:57:50,058 --> 00:57:52,475
(soft laugh)

1196
00:57:53,822 --> 00:57:55,600
(feet bang)

1197
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,442
How'd you know, it was me?

1198
00:57:57,442 --> 00:57:59,773
That cop came to my place. Davenport.

1199
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,796
Don't worry, I threw him off the trail.

1200
00:58:03,796 --> 00:58:06,463
(insects chirp)

1201
00:58:08,304 --> 00:58:10,856
(catch springs back)

1202
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:13,856
(trapdoor clatters)

1203
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:15,770
It's down there.

1204
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,223
Can I do the kids?

1205
00:58:22,242 --> 00:58:23,075
If you want.

1206
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:30,561
(receding footsteps)

1207
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:36,915
(sinister music)

1208
00:58:36,915 --> 00:58:38,863
(stairs creak)

1209
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:41,820
He's got a problem with women. He's got a thing for games.

1210
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,653
The point is let's make him think

1211
00:58:42,653 --> 00:58:44,690
we've got an entire operation back here.

1212
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,153
Set up just for him.

1213
00:58:46,153 --> 00:58:48,170
I wanna see if I can get him to play my game now.

1214
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,410
We can take his composite,

1215
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:51,520
run it through a program which would show like

1216
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,660
a thousand variations of his face.

1217
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,493
Good, good.

1218
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:56,410
Vega, I want you on this terminal pulling up

1219
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,140
3-D lift off showing how we're tracking his

1220
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,490
cell phone from the helicopter, right?

1221
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,620
Don't worry. I'll show you how to do it.

1222
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,590
Ice. You get to be the bait.

1223
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,680
Ooh, I like that.

1224
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,830
So will he.

1225
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,970
You'll be a new challenge so, hopefully he'll bite.

1226
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,292
Don't worry. He'll be here.

1227
00:59:10,292 --> 00:59:12,290
(phone rings)

1228
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,850
Palomas.

1229
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,860
Channel 6. They'll be here in an hour for a live remote.

1230
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,693
All right.

1231
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,093
Show time.

1232
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:22,000
(cameras click, whir)

1233
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,810
The fact is between chief Davenport's

1234
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,790
counter gaming expertise and the state of the art

1235
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,380
technology we've got here,

1236
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,620
we figured it'll be a matter of hours.

1237
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,510
Despite how clever this guy thinks he is,

1238
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,098
he's never seen programs like these before.

1239
00:59:34,098 --> 00:59:35,816
(scoffs)
(overlapping shouts)

1240
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:36,649
How will the computer technology

1241
00:59:36,649 --> 00:59:38,530
help determine identity and location?

1242
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,440
Basically, he's been reduced to a binary

1243
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,110
set in a probability curve.
(tense music)

1244
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,830
And can you tell us if he's in the Metro area?

1245
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:47,040
I, I don't wanna get specific right now,

1246
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,258
but I can tell you we're very close to locating him, and

1247
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:53,187
Don't play games, Davenport.

1248
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:54,235
Don't play games.

1249
00:59:54,235 --> 00:59:57,307
(sinister music)

1250
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,974
(switch clicks)

1251
01:00:13,306 --> 01:00:14,723
I'm up, I'm up.

1252
01:00:16,478 --> 01:00:17,832
I'm sorry.

1253
01:00:17,832 --> 01:00:19,263
That's okay.

1254
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:21,478
I was waiting for you.

1255
01:00:21,478 --> 01:00:23,002
(chuckles)

1256
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:23,835
Yeah. Right?

1257
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,230
How are you doing?

1258
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,153
I'm all right.

1259
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,560
Besides the fact that I keep feeling

1260
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,254
like I'm running on a treadmill.

1261
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:43,337
(scoffs)

1262
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,150
Maybe you just need to change the way you're doing things?

1263
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,693
Old dog, new tricks, baby. You know how that goes.

1264
01:00:53,777 --> 01:00:54,610
Yeah.

1265
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:58,241
Hey, how was your day?

1266
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:04,428
It's 1:30 in the morning, baby.

1267
01:01:06,465 --> 01:01:08,565
I don't know how we got into this routine.

1268
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,780
I'm gonna brief you on my day.

1269
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,640
You're gonna pretend to listen,

1270
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,170
and then we're gonna pretend everything's cool.

1271
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,060
Look, Weather, I just got a lot

1272
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,317
of stuff going on.
Don't give me that

1273
01:01:17,317 --> 01:01:20,993
"It's the job," speech.

1274
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,739
I mean, I don't, I don't wanna be a nag.

1275
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:30,339
I just wanna know that you wanna make some progress.

1276
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:39,484
You don't think I want the same thing you do?

1277
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:48,850
(gentle music)
You know, I...

1278
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:49,820
I see things in people.

1279
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,653
I...

1280
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,553
I see things in people that you don't.

1281
01:01:56,529 --> 01:01:59,477
That doesn't mean I'm not trying, I'm...

1282
01:02:03,516 --> 01:02:04,766
I'm right here.

1283
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:11,221
You gotta trust that.

1284
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,709
Tired you are? I know.

1285
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:32,540
Shh. C'mon.

1286
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,627
C'mon. C'mon, lay down.

1287
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:43,003
Come to bed.

1288
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:44,640
(scoffs)

1289
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,990
(groans)
I wish I could.

1290
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:51,483
I gotta take a shower. Go back to the station.

1291
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:55,881
There's something I'm not seeing.

1292
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:56,714
Okay.

1293
01:03:00,034 --> 01:03:02,617
(gentle music)

1294
01:03:14,773 --> 01:03:16,856
I'm doing the best I can.

1295
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:22,626
I know.

1296
01:03:30,308 --> 01:03:32,180
(phone rings)

1297
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,946
You too, huh?
(siren wails)

1298
01:03:33,946 --> 01:03:34,779
Hey.

1299
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:46,303
So, did you ask her yet?

1300
01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:51,432
(laughing)

1301
01:03:54,951 --> 01:03:56,910
No, I haven't.

1302
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,845
Oh.

1303
01:03:57,845 --> 01:03:59,595
Oh, yeah. You know?

1304
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:01,383
Problems?

1305
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:04,060
You know what's funny is

1306
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,950
the only time I seem to be comfortable

1307
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,305
is when I'm in here at 3:00 AM.

1308
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:11,313
(chuckles)

1309
01:04:11,313 --> 01:04:12,313
I miss your laugh.

1310
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,580
Give yourself a chance, Lucas.

1311
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,033
You deserve to be happy.

1312
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,323
Maybe when this is over.

1313
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,630
It's getting closer to over.

1314
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:42,840
Well, it was until this John Mail dropped out.

1315
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,900
Assault, rape, severe claustrophobia.

1316
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,733
Yeah.

1317
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:48,953
He had it all.

1318
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:55,283
What?

1319
01:04:56,566 --> 01:04:59,316
The sole witness to John Mail's suicide was a female.

1320
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,850
Gloria Crosby.
(tense music)

1321
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:02,930
The woman we questioned?

1322
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:03,763
Call Black. Get him out of bed.

1323
01:05:03,763 --> 01:05:05,100
Have him check St. Peter's,

1324
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,050
get everything he can on Crosby and Mail.

1325
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,890
And then have to check the John Mail suicide file

1326
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,820
and meet us over at Gloria Crosby's.

1327
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,546
(indistinct)
(tense music)

1328
01:05:14,546 --> 01:05:15,379
Gloria?

1329
01:05:16,675 --> 01:05:18,126
(knocks on door)

1330
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:21,491
(door bursts open)
Gloria!

1331
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:24,158
(ominous music)

1332
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:36,190
(dramatic sting)

1333
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,023
Damn.

1334
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:40,665
(footsteps)

1335
01:05:40,665 --> 01:05:41,498
No! Oh!

1336
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,953
Oh! Okay.

1337
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,453
(soft music)

1338
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,140
Gloria Crosby, I presume?

1339
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,310
Medical examiner pulled these photos of the autopsy.

1340
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:57,690
He got all tangled up in a bunch of wires and stuff.

1341
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,380
Body decomposed beyond recognition.

1342
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,750
Or someone anchored him to the bottom of the river.

1343
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,150
What about St. Peters?

1344
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,643
Chief psychiatrist St. Peters

1345
01:06:04,643 --> 01:06:05,476
said he knew Mail and Crosby.

1346
01:06:05,476 --> 01:06:06,630
Said they were friends.

1347
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,570
Tell me one of 'em worked in the infirmary.

1348
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,190
Crosby. How d'you know?

1349
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:13,130
Because they had to have access

1350
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,980
to switch the dental records.

1351
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,430
Gloria Crosby helped Mail fake his death.

1352
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:19,863
What about the body in the river?

1353
01:06:19,863 --> 01:06:21,113
That was somebody else.

1354
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,793
John Mail's alive.

1355
01:06:31,379 --> 01:06:33,962
(tense music)

1356
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,930
He's gonna kill us soon, isn't he?

1357
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:46,471
I hate this place.

1358
01:06:50,662 --> 01:06:52,262
Ouch.

1359
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:54,762
(slaps floor)

1360
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:57,268
What is it?

1361
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:04,264
Help me.

1362
01:07:04,264 --> 01:07:08,931
(fabric tears)
(grunts)

1363
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,517
A spring?

1364
01:07:12,703 --> 01:07:13,536
A tool.

1365
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:16,999
To take out the nail.

1366
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,666
(intense music)

1367
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:27,622
(taps keyboard)

1368
01:07:28,597 --> 01:07:32,014
(distant traffic passes)

1369
01:07:36,518 --> 01:07:39,935
(computer beeps rapidly)

1370
01:07:49,097 --> 01:07:51,729
(taps keyboard)

1371
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:54,729
(suspenseful music)

1372
01:07:59,652 --> 01:08:02,319
(taps keyboard)

1373
01:08:12,164 --> 01:08:13,331
Oh, my God!

1374
01:08:16,063 --> 01:08:18,850
He's made contact twice.

1375
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:19,920
Well, you think he's coming?

1376
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,753
Yeah.

1377
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:22,630
We need to set up road blocks in and around Stillwater.

1378
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:24,370
I wanna check every van coming and going.

1379
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:25,850
I'll also need every cop you can spare

1380
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:27,539
to flood the area around Paloma's

1381
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:28,398
(phone rings)

1382
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:29,600
What if he doesn't take the bait?

1383
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,350
Well, then I'll do it the old-fashioned way.

1384
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,870
You start roasting suspects

1385
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:35,420
and we're both gonna be unemployed.

1386
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,040
Unless you're out of the office when it happens,

1387
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,210
I acted on my own authority.

1388
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:40,730
You won't know about it until it's over.

1389
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,360
You willing to sacrifice your career for this, Lucas?

1390
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,425
If I have to.

1391
01:08:44,425 --> 01:08:46,505
(door slams)

1392
01:08:46,505 --> 01:08:48,017
(cats wail)

1393
01:08:48,017 --> 01:08:49,692
(tense music)

1394
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:52,525
(thunder rumbles)

1395
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,763
Vega, you got anything?

1396
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,893
All's clear in the south alley.

1397
01:09:19,695 --> 01:09:21,695
(sighs)

1398
01:09:25,502 --> 01:09:26,335
I don't know, if it were me,

1399
01:09:26,335 --> 01:09:28,520
I wouldn't even come near this place.

1400
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,400
Yeah, but you're not a psychopath are you?

1401
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,620
Don't worry. He'll be here.

1402
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,233
I got someone coming in.

1403
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,273
What are you talking about? I'm right here.

1404
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,640
He's in the alley, Lucas.

1405
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,470
I can't see his face,

1406
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,879
but he's looking at looking at Paloma's.

1407
01:09:49,879 --> 01:09:51,546
Looking at Paloma's.

1408
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:54,455
I got him.

1409
01:09:54,455 --> 01:09:56,955
(tense music)

1410
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,963
What d'ya wanna do, Lucas?

1411
01:09:58,963 --> 01:10:01,450
All right, everybody on your toes.

1412
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:02,880
Be ready to flood the area?

1413
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,080
Get ready, Sloan. He's coming towards you.

1414
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:09,474
(dramatic music)

1415
01:10:09,474 --> 01:10:11,807
(footsteps)

1416
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,048
(door opens)

1417
01:10:17,048 --> 01:10:18,933
Police! Put it down!

1418
01:10:18,933 --> 01:10:19,766
Freeze!
Put it down!

1419
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:20,820
(gun roars)
(metal clangs)

1420
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,210
Ow, my leg!
Who are you?

1421
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:23,260
Rick Bryce!

1422
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,096
Check him.
What are you doing here?

1423
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:26,330
Guy said I could score some blow

1424
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:28,440
if I gave this to a guy named Davenport.

1425
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,273
(gun cocks)
Don't move!

1426
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:30,606
Don't be stupid!

1427
01:10:33,273 --> 01:10:35,560
Greave, check the area.

1428
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,440
No, no, something's not right.

1429
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,273
Lucas.

1430
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:44,304
Vega!

1431
01:10:44,304 --> 01:10:45,426
(dramatic music)
Greave, he's here!

1432
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:46,259
Vega!

1433
01:10:47,413 --> 01:10:49,330
Watch him. Watch him!

1434
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:56,687
Vega!
(dramatic music)

1435
01:10:56,687 --> 01:10:59,020
(loud bang)

1436
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:05,299
(ladder clatters)

1437
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:10,884
Cheryl?

1438
01:11:14,639 --> 01:11:15,972
God, no. Cheryl?

1439
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:29,310
(dramatic music)

1440
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:32,310
(running footsteps)

1441
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:47,919
(machinery whirs)

1442
01:11:54,115 --> 01:11:57,115
(footsteps clatter)

1443
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:12,224
(running footsteps)
(dramatic music)

1444
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:13,875
(multiple gunshots)

1445
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,387
(bullet ricochets)

1446
01:12:16,387 --> 01:12:18,887
(bars rattle)

1447
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,505
(shouts)

1448
01:12:26,451 --> 01:12:28,618
(panting)

1449
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:43,344
(indistinct radio)
(helicopter passes over)

1450
01:12:43,344 --> 01:12:45,580
I'm sorry, man.

1451
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,330
Chief, we got a woman in a house down the alley,

1452
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:48,380
beaten pretty bad.

1453
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,930
Purse missing, car missing.

1454
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:50,887
He made it out.

1455
01:12:57,205 --> 01:13:02,205
(phone rings)
(tense music)

1456
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,753
Mail.

1457
01:13:16,753 --> 01:13:18,460
I beat you Lucas.

1458
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,930
I sprung your trap when I took out

1459
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,993
your little bitch cop girlfriend as well.

1460
01:13:25,045 --> 01:13:26,773
Hey. You know my name?

1461
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:28,763
Yeah.

1462
01:13:28,763 --> 01:13:29,950
I know everything.

1463
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:32,450
I know about Gloria Crosby and your accomplice.

1464
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,940
You know about her?

1465
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,773
Her.

1466
01:13:34,773 --> 01:13:35,690
Yeah, her.

1467
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,210
But she doesn't matter.

1468
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,640
'Cause this is still between you and me.

1469
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,499
No, no! It's not!

1470
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,082
(tense music)

1471
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:46,500
Give me back Andi and the kids.

1472
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,540
I'll see you in hell, Davenport.

1473
01:13:51,861 --> 01:13:54,875
(phone bangs, clatters)
(dramatic sting)

1474
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:57,210
Greave, you and Black go get Lydia Wolf.

1475
01:13:57,210 --> 01:13:58,210
Sloan, you get Helen Manette.

1476
01:13:58,210 --> 01:13:59,300
What d'you mean, get?

1477
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,530
I mean, get 'em outta bed!

1478
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:02,320
No dressing, no lawyers, nothing.

1479
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,210
He's closing down the game.

1480
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:04,870
He's gonna kill Manette and the kids.

1481
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:05,730
You're gonna shake 'em down?

1482
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,550
He said his accomplice was a her.

1483
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:08,383
You don't know which one.

1484
01:14:08,383 --> 01:14:09,433
But I'm gonna find out.

1485
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:12,322
Lucas, if you do this, you go down.

1486
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:14,155
Then we all go down.

1487
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:21,100
Black. Give me your phone.

1488
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:24,246
I'm sorry.

1489
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,345
We're gonna get him, all right?

1490
01:14:28,345 --> 01:14:29,178
Yeah.

1491
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:33,930
(phone beeps)

1492
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,640
Marie, it's Lucas.

1493
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,520
Tell me what I heard about Vega isn't true?

1494
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,853
Yeah, she's gone.

1495
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,170
Oh, God Lucas.

1496
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,123
Listen, you need to be outta touch for a few hours.

1497
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:50,690
You know they'll take your badge?

1498
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,420
If I don't do it my way, I don't want it.

1499
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,620
Just make sure I have a chopper standing by.

1500
01:14:55,765 --> 01:14:57,728
It's coming out.

1501
01:14:57,728 --> 01:15:00,107
(tense music)

1502
01:15:00,107 --> 01:15:01,952
(footsteps overhead)

1503
01:15:01,952 --> 01:15:02,785
Shh.

1504
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,303
Where is he?

1505
01:15:07,454 --> 01:15:08,340
I dunno.

1506
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,670
I just need a little more time, but he's coming.

1507
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:14,503
I can feel it. I know he's coming.

1508
01:15:17,872 --> 01:15:20,622
(dramatic sting)

1509
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,723
This time he is gonna feel it.

1510
01:15:28,306 --> 01:15:31,371
(car roars past)

1511
01:15:31,371 --> 01:15:34,121
(dramatic music)

1512
01:15:39,347 --> 01:15:42,930
(indistinct radio chatter)

1513
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:48,574
(car revs away)

1514
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:59,889
(dramatic music)

1515
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,180
(door bangs open)

1516
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,896
Listen, you can't do this.

1517
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:03,950
(door bangs)
Get me my lawyer.

1518
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,560
You get a lawyer when I say you get a lawyer.

1519
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,040
Your psycho patient kill my partner!

1520
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,310
My best friend!
I don't know

1521
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:10,440
what you're talking about!

1522
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,273
Oh, yeah?

1523
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:13,133
Now what if I can prove you're doing Tower Manette,

1524
01:16:13,133 --> 01:16:15,310
does that help jog your memory, doctor?

1525
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:16,343
I want my husband!

1526
01:16:18,653 --> 01:16:22,070
(punches violently)

1527
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:24,390
Your husband doesn't want you!

1528
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:25,930
You know what he wants?

1529
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,920
He wants his daughter and his granddaughters.

1530
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,040
When he finds out that you and your little friend

1531
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,330
were thinkin' about carving 'em up

1532
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,350
and serving 'em like dog food,

1533
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,210
you know what's gonna happen to you?

1534
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:35,720
You're gonna to end up with nothing!

1535
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,930
So come on, come clean.

1536
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:38,763
Talk to me.

1537
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:44,803
Sloan, get something.

1538
01:16:44,803 --> 01:16:46,420
(door opens)

1539
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,720
(door bangs)
Excuse me!

1540
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:50,627
You said whatever it takes.

1541
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:51,750
Not like this.

1542
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,050
We're getting a court order.

1543
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:55,200
Well, when it's in your hand then you talk to me.

1544
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,930
You are finished, Davenport!

1545
01:16:56,930 --> 01:16:59,080
I'll handle this, Tower.

1546
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,170
We're back in half an hour. We'll deal with you then.

1547
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:03,083
Cool. Get 'em outta here.

1548
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:05,034
(door bangs)
You're outta your mind!

1549
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:07,560
You can't do this. You're violating my rights.

1550
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,560
Look at me.

1551
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,883
You think I care about what you think?

1552
01:17:10,883 --> 01:17:13,783
Right now, the only thing I care about is John Mail.

1553
01:17:13,783 --> 01:17:14,616
I don't know him.

1554
01:17:14,616 --> 01:17:15,449
I think you do and I think you better start telling me

1555
01:17:15,449 --> 01:17:16,300
where he is right now!

1556
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,710
I didn't do anything!

1557
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:18,627
Oh, no?
Argh!

1558
01:17:18,627 --> 01:17:19,983
You're an angel, huh?

1559
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,240
All right, Angel.

1560
01:17:24,298 --> 01:17:26,740
What happens when I go next door?

1561
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,133
And I tell Helen Manette you're doing her husband?

1562
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,117
Huh?

1563
01:17:31,117 --> 01:17:33,467
Don't you think she's gonna wanna serve you up?

1564
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,304
Don't you think she's gonna want you to go down for this?

1565
01:17:36,304 --> 01:17:37,137
Huh?

1566
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:39,953
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do.

1567
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,650
Unless you give me something different

1568
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,250
and you give it to me right now.

1569
01:17:46,783 --> 01:17:47,616
Ugh!

1570
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,033
Okay.

1571
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:55,823
We do it your way.

1572
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,685
You stay here. You stay shackled.

1573
01:17:59,685 --> 01:18:00,727
(door opens)

1574
01:18:00,727 --> 01:18:01,560
Oh, you can't do this.

1575
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,393
Watch me!

1576
01:18:02,393 --> 01:18:03,447
Give me my lawyer!

1577
01:18:03,447 --> 01:18:04,280
(doors bang)

1578
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,750
Please! Take me home.

1579
01:18:07,147 --> 01:18:08,420
All right. What'd you get, Sloan?

1580
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:09,570
I'm working on it.

1581
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:10,403
You're working on it?

1582
01:18:10,403 --> 01:18:12,446
What, are you deaf? I told you what to do!

1583
01:18:12,446 --> 01:18:13,524
(punch lands)
Come on!

1584
01:18:13,524 --> 01:18:15,107
My God!
Come on!

1585
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,790
That's too far. Lucas.

1586
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:18,990
Yeah. You're pathetic.

1587
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:22,231
(door bangs)

1588
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:23,831
Look lady. I'm outta patience.

1589
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,607
I got nothing left to lose.

1590
01:18:31,596 --> 01:18:33,346
So where's John Mail?

1591
01:18:34,183 --> 01:18:35,016
Where is he?

1592
01:18:35,016 --> 01:18:36,143
No listen. You don't understand.

1593
01:18:36,143 --> 01:18:37,637
I-
Now, no, now!

1594
01:18:37,637 --> 01:18:38,470
Tell me now!
(screams)

1595
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:39,303
Please don't hurt me!

1596
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:40,532
Where is he?
Please don't hurt me!

1597
01:18:40,532 --> 01:18:41,668
Now! Where is he now?

1598
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:42,720
A farm in the country.
(suspenseful music)

1599
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:44,110
I only know the telephone number.

1600
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:47,102
Really I do, please, please I beg you.

1601
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:48,910
She's the connection.

1602
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:49,743
Let's go.

1603
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,113
You all right?

1604
01:18:52,113 --> 01:18:52,946
Yeah.

1605
01:18:52,946 --> 01:18:54,940
Next time we do that routine. I throw the the punch.

1606
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:55,920
You got it.

1607
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,753
Get the chopper!

1608
01:18:59,372 --> 01:19:01,794
(engine roars)
(tires screech)

1609
01:19:01,794 --> 01:19:04,270
(dramatic music)

1610
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:07,270
(helicopter throbs)

1611
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,517
(tires screech)

1612
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:23,349
(rotors throb)

1613
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,742
(tense music)

1614
01:19:29,742 --> 01:19:32,242
(cocks rifle)

1615
01:19:39,512 --> 01:19:42,775
There he is! Set us on the ground!

1616
01:19:42,775 --> 01:19:47,775
(engine whines)
(rotors clatter)

1617
01:19:50,508 --> 01:19:53,294
(trapdoor clunks)

1618
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:54,780
Mom?

1619
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:59,780
(clumping footsteps)
Don't think, just run.

1620
01:20:02,195 --> 01:20:04,945
(dramatic music)

1621
01:20:10,034 --> 01:20:13,646
(door bangs open)

1622
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:14,641
Up!

1623
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,284
Ugh! Go!

1624
01:20:16,284 --> 01:20:18,419
(gun fires)

1625
01:20:18,419 --> 01:20:20,225
(dramatic music)

1626
01:20:20,225 --> 01:20:21,058
Go!

1627
01:20:24,193 --> 01:20:25,345
Hold it!

1628
01:20:25,345 --> 01:20:26,913
Move, move, move, go!

1629
01:20:26,913 --> 01:20:28,663
Go, go, go, go, go.

1630
01:20:29,975 --> 01:20:31,081
Clear. Come on!

1631
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:32,671
Go! Get 'em outta here!.

1632
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:35,062
Go! Get 'em out Black!

1633
01:20:35,062 --> 01:20:40,062
Get 'em outta here, now!
(dramatic music)

1634
01:20:44,484 --> 01:20:47,316
(dripping water)

1635
01:20:47,316 --> 01:20:49,816
(tense music)

1636
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:06,838
(music builds)

1637
01:21:06,838 --> 01:21:09,921
(multiple gun shots)

1638
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,710
(dramatic music)

1639
01:21:16,059 --> 01:21:18,788
(multiple gun shots)

1640
01:21:18,788 --> 01:21:23,788
(siren wails)
(tires screech)

1641
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,697
(gunshot)
Oh!

1642
01:21:26,697 --> 01:21:28,998
(groans)

1643
01:21:28,998 --> 01:21:31,457
(shouting)

1644
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:32,374
Wing him!

1645
01:21:33,712 --> 01:21:38,422
(people shouting)
(siren wails)

1646
01:21:38,422 --> 01:21:40,568
Let me get up!

1647
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:41,401
I'm okay.

1648
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:42,234
Let me go!
Stay down!

1649
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:43,067
Stay down, you're hurt!
Let me get up!

1650
01:21:43,067 --> 01:21:43,900
Get 'em outta here!

1651
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,612
My little girl. My little girl.

1652
01:21:45,612 --> 01:21:47,800
(shouts)
I'll get her, I promise.

1653
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,966
Which way?

1654
01:21:48,966 --> 01:21:50,074
That way!

1655
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:51,611
(dramatic music)

1656
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:52,810
Let me get up!

1657
01:21:52,810 --> 01:21:55,560
(dramatic music)

1658
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:18,154
(sirens wail)

1659
01:22:18,154 --> 01:22:20,904
(skid to a stop)

1660
01:22:22,256 --> 01:22:24,756
(tense music)

1661
01:22:29,202 --> 01:22:31,202
(pants)

1662
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,021
(splashing water)

1663
01:22:49,384 --> 01:22:54,384
(debris falls)
(suspenseful music)

1664
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,304
(soil thuds)
(rocks clatter)

1665
01:23:03,304 --> 01:23:04,974
You all right down there, John?

1666
01:23:04,974 --> 01:23:07,634
Davenport!
Where is she?

1667
01:23:07,634 --> 01:23:09,213
Where's the little girl?

1668
01:23:09,213 --> 01:23:11,074
Where's Genevieve, huh?

1669
01:23:11,074 --> 01:23:12,604
The one that wasn't really in the water barrel.

1670
01:23:12,604 --> 01:23:15,087
Where is she?
Let me out!

1671
01:23:15,087 --> 01:23:18,100
Let me out! She's dead!

1672
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,500
I still wanna know where she is!

1673
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:20,333
Where is she?

1674
01:23:24,842 --> 01:23:26,384
I can't breathe.

1675
01:23:26,384 --> 01:23:27,220
I can't breathe.

1676
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:30,100
What's wrong, John? Is it cramp?

1677
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,100
Huh?

1678
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,900
Must feel like Hal being so claustrophobic and all, huh?

1679
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,443
Tell me what does it feel like?

1680
01:23:36,443 --> 01:23:38,720
What did it feel like to put that family through it? Huh?

1681
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,925
What did it feel like to put one of my cops through it?

1682
01:23:41,925 --> 01:23:42,810
Is it hell, John?

1683
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,562
What does it feel like you sick son of a bitch?

1684
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:47,002
(yells)

1685
01:23:47,002 --> 01:23:49,472
(gunshot)

1686
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:51,639
(panting)

1687
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:58,131
(water trickles)

1688
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:05,803
Game over.

1689
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:19,456
(forlorn music)

1690
01:24:46,944 --> 01:24:48,821
(indistinct radio chatter)

1691
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:52,404
(helicopter engine whines)

1692
01:24:53,277 --> 01:24:56,777
Chief. You got time for the news people?

1693
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:06,601
(rotors clatter)

1694
01:25:17,882 --> 01:25:20,382
(radio beeps)

1695
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:26,249
(indistinct radio chatter)

1696
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:30,187
(distant banging)

1697
01:25:38,745 --> 01:25:39,995
Water barrel.

1698
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:44,017
(tense music)

1699
01:25:47,383 --> 01:25:49,883
(lid scrapes)

1700
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:53,614
(lid bangs)

1701
01:25:53,614 --> 01:25:56,447
(water splooshes)

1702
01:25:58,629 --> 01:26:00,270
Over here!

1703
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:02,462
Bring a rope! And a harness!

1704
01:26:02,462 --> 01:26:05,295
(dramatic music)

1705
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:10,418
It's okay, sweet. Here I come.

1706
01:26:17,662 --> 01:26:18,495
Mom!

1707
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:27,964
Put it down, put it down!

1708
01:26:27,964 --> 01:26:30,100
Oh my God! Oh my God!

1709
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,660
Oh my God!

1710
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:32,553
Baby. Baby!

1711
01:26:34,113 --> 01:26:35,563
I've got you sweetheart.

1712
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:36,796
Okay?
Oh, baby.

1713
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:38,546
No!
Is my mom, okay?

1714
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:41,561
Yeah. She's okay.

1715
01:26:41,561 --> 01:26:42,647
Everybody's okay.

1716
01:26:42,647 --> 01:26:45,516
I'm here, come up. Come on up.

1717
01:26:45,516 --> 01:26:47,292
(gasps)

1718
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:50,748
Pull her up! Pull her up!

1719
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:52,606
(dramatic music)
Mommy!

1720
01:26:52,606 --> 01:26:55,042
Get the paramedics. Move!

1721
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:58,805
(overlapping shouts)

1722
01:26:58,805 --> 01:27:00,722
(sobs)

1723
01:27:08,499 --> 01:27:10,216
All right, they've gotta take her.

1724
01:27:10,216 --> 01:27:11,888
It's important. We gotta take her.

1725
01:27:11,888 --> 01:27:12,901
(sobs)
We gotta take her.

1726
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:14,318
Come on, come on.

1727
01:27:15,525 --> 01:27:17,775
We got you. It's all right.

1728
01:27:22,473 --> 01:27:24,550
I don't think you understand. He abused his power.

1729
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,070
He went above the law!

1730
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:28,900
He also saved your partner and your children.

1731
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,320
That doesn't justify violating me!

1732
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,880
The fact is we'll sue for damages later,

1733
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,750
but right now we demand nothing less

1734
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,890
than Davenport's removal from the force.

1735
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:39,460
No, sir. It's not gonna happen.

1736
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,300
I'm sorry your client was inconvenienced

1737
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,467
but that's out of the question.

1738
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:44,010
Inconvenienced?
(door opens)

1739
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:46,130
I was strip searched for Christ's sake!

1740
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:46,963
Lucas!

1741
01:27:48,449 --> 01:27:49,290
You did it!
(door closes)

1742
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:51,773
Hey, my hero. Way to go kid.

1743
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,320
What he did was arrest my client without cause.

1744
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,710
imprison and interrogate her, abrogate her rights.

1745
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:01,500
And by the time we're finished suing this city,

1746
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,280
you'll be lucky if Mr. Davenport's the only one who's fired.

1747
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,550
I don't think so.

1748
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:09,660
Why? Because we're so grateful that you solved a crime?

1749
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,670
Well, actually, because Dr. Wolf here

1750
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:13,640
is gonna be appreciative if no one finds out about

1751
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,500
Carlos Sanchez or William Acres, to name a few.

1752
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,320
I-I-I don't believe this!

1753
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,670
You-you're blackmailing me?

1754
01:28:22,028 --> 01:28:23,450
Would someone explain to me?

1755
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:26,180
Go ahead, tell him Dr. Wolf,

1756
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,870
Tell him how you've been treating sex offenders

1757
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:30,180
without notifying the proper officials.

1758
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,150
Go ahead. Tell him.

1759
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:33,077
Oh, you son of a bitch!

1760
01:28:33,077 --> 01:28:33,910
Yeah.

1761
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:35,200
Counselor, would you inform your client

1762
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,010
if she doesn't get outta my office now

1763
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,823
she could lose her license and go to prison.

1764
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,880
I think we should talk.

1765
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,713
Thank you.

1766
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:54,120
Hey guys!
Hey, hey, hey!

1767
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,003
You're the best.

1768
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:59,770
Helen Manette signed a complete confession.

1769
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:00,770
Yep.

1770
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,330
By getting rid of Andi and our kids,

1771
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:03,163
she wouldn't have to share

1772
01:29:03,163 --> 01:29:05,793
the Tower Manette trust fund with anybody.

1773
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,300
Tower dies from the stress and then she gets everything.

1774
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,244
It's sick.
How are they?

1775
01:29:11,244 --> 01:29:12,077
The Manettes?

1776
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:14,320
The youngest girl, Genevieve.

1777
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,020
She wouldn't have lasted the rest of the day

1778
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,970
if Lucas hadn't have found her.

1779
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,520
What about Andi and the older one?

1780
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,480
Physically, okay.

1781
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,990
Mentally, not too good.

1782
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:23,870
Dad's with them down at the hospital.

1783
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:25,720
They got Black in the room next to them.

1784
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,583
He took it real hard about Cheryl.

1785
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,333
Yeah.

1786
01:29:35,644 --> 01:29:37,440
(phone rings)

1787
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,273
You okay?

1788
01:29:39,967 --> 01:29:40,800
Yeah.

1789
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,520
Lucas, are you sure you don't want-

1790
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,647
No, I got something to do.

1791
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:48,324
(door closes)

1792
01:29:48,324 --> 01:29:51,491
(traffic rushes past)

1793
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:55,253
(engine throbs)

1794
01:29:56,845 --> 01:29:59,928
(door opens, closes)

1795
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,170
(slow footsteps)

1796
01:30:22,257 --> 01:30:24,924
(forlorn music)

1797
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,373
(mellow music)
