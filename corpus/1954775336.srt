1
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,987
<i>I don't hear people there.</i>

2
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,523
<i>Let's go away to California.</i>

3
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,758
<i>Let's go to the beach.</i>

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,193
<i>I never been to the beach.</i>

5
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,229
<i>- Never?
- Never.</i>

6
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,165
<i>- Neither have I.
- I've never seen the ocean.</i>

7
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:09,802
<i>Bet it's beautiful.</i>

8
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,503
<i>- You want to come?
- Yeah.</i>

9
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,739
<i>- Yeah?
- Let's just run away forever.</i>

10
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,408
<i>Yeah.
I mean never come back.</i>

11
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,846
<i>But you have
so much going for you...</i>

12
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,614
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

13
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,883
<i>- We can do it.
- Your family's okay?</i>

14
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,351
<i>Yeah.</i>

15
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,388
Wait. Dad!

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,856
What are you doing?!
Who the hell are you?

17
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,057
Dad, let him go!
Let him go!

18
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,859
Who are you?!
Who are you?!

19
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,360
- Please!
- Get out of here.

20
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,229
<i>- Dad! Don't.
- Get out of here.</i>

21
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,132
- Dad, don't.
- Sorry little bastard.

22
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,667
Pack up and get off my ranch.

23
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,803
- Please.
- No, no, get off by sunrise.

24
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,339
You're not to make this ranch
into whore house for queers.

25
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,374
- You hear me? Not on my watch.
- Okay.

26
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,276
- Go to your mother's house!
- Okay.

27
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,878
When you straight out,
you can come back, all right?

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,379
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

29
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,383
Read your goddamn Bible!
Then you can come back!

30
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,553
Get out of here,
you disgusting little prick!

31
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,988
Son of a bitch.

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,524
Son of a bitch, my son.

33
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:09,228
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

34
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,630
I can't believe this shit.

35
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,333
I can't believe
this shit.

36
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:16,034
I always knew.

37
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,204
Buttercup,
what are you doing?

38
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,340
What are you doing, huh?

39
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:24,143
What are you doing out here,
huh?

40
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,945
You sleeping in the barn now?

41
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,480
Let's go to the house with me.

42
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,384
That's a good girl.
Good girl, yeah.

43
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,488
Good girl.
Good girl.

44
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,758
Come on, girl.
Let's up to the house.

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,260
What?

46
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,700
Don't wake up, Pedro.

47
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,502
Don't wake up him.

48
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,972
What? What?

49
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,909
What?

50
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,343
What?

51
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:47,960
Easy, easy.

52
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,162
Yeah. Hello?

53
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,731
Maria.

54
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,900
Oh, what's that?

55
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,570
Hold on.
Hold that chucker.

56
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,206
I'll be right there. Hold on.
I'm coming. Hold on.

57
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,507
I'll be there.

58
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,764
All right!
Party's over, boys. Back off.

59
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,367
Get off my property
and away from my people.

60
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,469
I mean it now.
Go back to your own country.

61
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:34,239
- All right!
- Go on.

62
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,642
This guy, his wife died,
that's his son,

63
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,510
and he wants a better life
for the boy here.

64
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,112
They want him back over there.

65
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,414
Thank you.
You saved my ass.

66
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,849
You hear that?
We're gonna keep him.

67
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,151
Now go on. Go on back.

68
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,819
Yeah.

69
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:51,857
Take him back to your place
and get some food and rest.

70
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,160
And call the proper authorities
or maybe not.

71
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,263
I'll leave that up to you,
all right? Okay.

72
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,932
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

73
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,536
Go on now.
Go on back. Go on.

74
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,872
If you come back,
I'll shoot your legs

75
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,407
right out from under you.

76
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,109
I can do that.
All right?

77
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,345
Don't cross this river again.

78
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,647
Stay off my property.
Stay out of Texas.

79
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,418
Texas Rangers!

80
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,458
Texas Rangers!

81
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,048
Hey, children.
What is your name?

82
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,718
Hey, sweetheart.
Show me your cars.

83
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,133
You ready to come out?

84
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,769
- Yes.
- Yes? Let's go.

85
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:14,072
<i>Come. Come with me.
There you go.</i>

86
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,875
<i>There you go.
Yes, let's go.</i>

87
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,011
- All right, there you go,
sweetie, come on.
- Here's your car.

88
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,881
<i>This is dispatch.
What's your situation?</i>

89
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,118
- Leave that car.
- Sheriff, it's the captain.

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,653
This is a bad one,
real bad.

91
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,422
I need some help over here.

92
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,125
Please send Scott over here
as soon as you can.

93
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:35,360
Let me see your motor,
your car.

94
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,396
Wow!
Where is the fastest car here?

95
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,565
This one.
This car is the fastest.

96
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,002
Come on.
Come on. Okay.

97
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,215
Have you ever thought
about quitting the Rangers?

98
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,052
Yeah, I have.

99
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,457
I hope someday that I never
have to interview

100
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:42,661
another rape victim
or a burned child

101
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,896
or see another
mutilated body.

102
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:52,103
Not many people
can do our job, Sam.

103
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,939
Most people would go insane.

104
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,300
Hi, it's me.

105
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,003
You doing your homework?

106
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,272
You going riding later?

107
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,874
Okay.

108
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:32,043
We'll have dinner tonight
in a fun place, okay?

109
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,012
All right.
Hugs.

110
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,647
Bye.

111
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,845
Absolutely, yes.

112
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:11,316
I was explaining to Ms. Davis
that we never close a cold case.

113
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:14,085
I'll leave you two
to talk about it.

114
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,423
Thank you very much.

115
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:21,326
So I'm sorry about your loss,
Mrs. Davis.

116
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,495
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

117
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,363
What was your son's name?

118
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,132
Jimmy.

119
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,167
What else can you tell me
about your son?

120
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,972
Well, he was a very good,
very good, wonderful person.

121
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:45,550
I want you to find out
if my son was killed

122
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,385
and who killed him.

123
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,421
I will speak
with the head Ranger,

124
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:54,626
the Captain that you just met,
and we'll go into the files

125
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,995
and we'll do our best
to give you an answer.

126
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,863
Thank you very much.

127
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,468
Who was in charge
of the Jimmy Davis case

128
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,738
- 15 years ago?
- That would have been
Ranger Jackson,

129
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,074
- and he retired
about two years ago.
- Yeah.

130
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,610
He was in charge
of the office back then.

131
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,745
You know, quite honestly,
Sam, I don't...

132
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,413
I know about the case,

133
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,148
but I don't know much
about the details.

134
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,018
But I did find the case file.
I want you to have it.

135
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,455
Good thing is,
Ranger Jackson is gonna be here

136
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,190
day after tomorrow
for the town barbecue.

137
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,425
It'd be a really good time
for you to sit down with him

138
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,494
- and get the details on it.
- Sure.

139
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,062
Yeah, I really wanna work
on this case,

140
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,697
- if it's okay with you.
- You got it.

141
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,201
Get those feet out
in front of you, Buster.

142
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,437
<i>You're doing
pretty darn good, Buster,</i>

143
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,374
for a little squirt your size.

144
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,643
<i>Watch me.</i>

145
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,578
Easy on the bit.
Come on.

146
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,146
Come on, Buster.

147
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,816
Maybe someday you can
outride me.

148
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,752
Let go of that horn, Buster.

149
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,121
<i>I'm starting
to ride like John Wayne!</i>

150
00:10:56,123 --> 00:11:00,859
Riding like John Wayne's cousin.
Buster, your grandpa's here.

151
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,727
How am I doing, grandpa?

152
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,863
You're doing pretty damn good.
Don't talk to me.

153
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,332
Just listen to KC, all right?
He'll teach you.

154
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,601
Starting to get good enough
so's he can ride your horse.

155
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,771
- That's not gonna
happen for a while.
- That's what I told him.

156
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,472
She can do it,
but he can't, no.

157
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,509
Hey, I wanna show you
something.

158
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,145
Hey, kids.
Come on!

159
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,747
<i>Got a strange phone call
last night</i>

160
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,683
<i>with some woman's voice
attached to it.</i>

161
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,919
<i>Didn't belong to me.
Wrong number.</i>

162
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,921
Yeah, it's hard enough
to make one work, Pop,

163
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,424
let alone two at the same time,
it ain't easy.

164
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:36,561
Yeah, well, don't join
my divorce club.

165
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,198
Try to avoid that.
Tell you that right now.

166
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:51,242
Watch,
you'll get an education.

167
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,311
<i>Reminds me of when
you were a teenager.</i>

168
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,296
Hey.

169
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,497
<i>Go get him, Pa.</i>

170
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,466
<i>Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.</i>

171
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:30,882
- Come on.
- Come on.

172
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,120
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

173
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,798
You boys have good touch.

174
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,568
That's a good girl.
Come here, touch her.

175
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,103
Come on. Yeah.

176
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,473
<i>Put your hand out here.
Yeah.</i>

177
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,982
Bite his hand off.
Bite his hand off.

178
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,818
That's good. That's good.

179
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,354
You've been working him good,
son.

180
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,489
Good work.

181
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,558
Everybody down.
Let's go.

182
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,660
Who's hungry?
Who's hungry?

183
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,629
Last one in the truck's
a rotten egg!

184
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,031
Gonna be you, old man.

185
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,000
Grandpa is gonna be
the rotten egg.

186
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,236
Who's the rotten egg?
Who's the rotten egg?

187
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,471
Scootch over, Lizzie.

188
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,044
Come on, Augustus.
Come on, buddy.

189
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,749
Attaboy. Let's go.
Who's the rotten egg?

190
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,517
- You.
- Me?

191
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,221
- Grandpa's the rotten egg!
- Yeah, I'm the rotten egg.

192
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,524
- Who's the rotten egg?
- Grandpa!

193
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,369
Hey, Buster.

194
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:04,609
Okay. Okay, go on.
Get on. I'll be right down.

195
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,944
Come on, Augustus!

196
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,614
- I gotta go change.
- Come on, boy.

197
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,416
Go ahead.
I'll be right back.

198
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,656
Hey!

199
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,427
- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, Buster!
Get your hand out of there.

200
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,463
What'd I tell you about eating
other people's food, huh?

201
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,721
How you doing?

202
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,457
Milo,
don't overcook that meat.

203
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,126
Yeah.

204
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,529
Good to see everybody.
Right. Have a good time.

205
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,131
<i>Good to see you.</i>

206
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,576
Hey, Pa.

207
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,211
What are you doing?

208
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,812
I don't know.

209
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,216
Just looking at those horses
over there.

210
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,051
<i>I wish your ma could've come.</i>

211
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,954
- Me too.
- Yeah.

212
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,860
You think, uh...

213
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:31,696
you think your mom
would let me move back in?

214
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,865
- Of course.
- Are you serious?

215
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,967
Yeah.
She was talking about you.

216
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:40,838
She saying she want me there?
Yeah?

217
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,675
Why do you think
she don't want you there?

218
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:50,949
I don't know.
You know your ma.

219
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,952
She changes her mind a lot.

220
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,554
Well, that's who I got it from.
I got all jacked up.

221
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,259
- Mr. Briggs, how you doing?
- Good to see you, sir.

222
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,528
I wanna introduce you
to Texas Ranger Samantha Payne.

223
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,931
- Hello, sir, nice meeting you.
- Yes, ma'am.

224
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,133
- My son, Cody.
- Cody, good to see you.

225
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,402
I'll see you guys
in a minute.

226
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,371
Thank you.

227
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,140
Yeah, I never met
a lady Ranger before.

228
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,809
I didn't know they had 'em.

229
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,544
Yeah,
we can vote now as well.

230
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,679
That's good.

231
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,048
Buster... Buster?

232
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,184
Buster Briggs,
where you at?

233
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:30,188
I want you to meet
a lady Texas Ranger.

234
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,290
- Hi,
- Hello, sir.
Nice handshake.

235
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,958
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

236
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,094
- Good. You having fun?
- Yes, ma'am.

237
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,762
- Excellent.
- That's her son Cody.

238
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,430
Nice to meet you.

239
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,899
Maybe I can be a Texas Ranger
when I grow up.

240
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,634
- You want to?
- Yes, sir.

241
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,571
I thought you said you wanted
to run the ranch with me.

242
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,674
Yes, sir, but even
if you're 100, I could do both.

243
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,276
No, wait a minute.
What do you mean you'll do both?

244
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,379
<i>I don't know about that.
Well, we'll see.</i>

245
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,115
Let me think about it.

246
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,283
You're not very good
at work, son.

247
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,519
Go learn to be a cowboy.
Go on, get out of here.

248
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,455
Cody, go get some...
I'll see you in a minute.

249
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,923
<i>Oh, God almighty.</i>

250
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,792
- Yeah, they're something.
- They are.

251
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,861
-<i> Listen,</i>
<i>let me ask you something.</i>
- Yes, sir.

252
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,363
- in two weeks, we're gonna have
a competitive cook-off.
- Okay.

253
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,932
I would like to invite you and
your son as my special guests.

254
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,367
Well, I appreciate that.

255
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,336
And thank you so much
for having us.

256
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,937
Very nice party.
Thank you, sir.

257
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,206
- Ma'am.
- Nice meeting you.

258
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,914
Look what rolled in.
Nice to see you, sheriff.

259
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,183
- How are you, Scott?
- Good to see you.
Good to see you.

260
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,253
- Deputy, good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

261
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,489
Well, I don't know
if Ranger Captain mentioned,

262
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,192
I took over
the Jimmy Davis case,

263
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,328
<i>and the files and notes
indicate</i>

264
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,332
that the kid maybe,
possibly committed suicide.

265
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:52,103
Well, little lady, first thing,
I don't think it was suicide.

266
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:55,640
And I said the obvious suspect

267
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,043
in this case was Scott Briggs.

268
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,145
<i>And what was the evidence then?</i>

269
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,616
Well, his son,
the day he sent him off,

270
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:09,220
the young boy disappeared.

271
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:12,223
Then Pedro or whatever
the hell his name was...

272
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,125
Pedro had looked after
the horses...

273
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,560
He disappeared.

274
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,463
<i>Briggs had a lot to lose
in this thing,</i>

275
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,399
and I've had
that gut feeling for years

276
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,602
that everything starts
and ends right here.

277
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,137
Right here.

278
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,407
Now, them two young boys liked
to ride horses

279
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,676
and have a good time together,
and they played...

280
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,244
They played a little grab-ass

281
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,012
or whatever goes
on between them.

282
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:36,681
That's their business.
It's none of mine.

283
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:41,052
These were young boys.
They're human beings.

284
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,821
They deserve the protection
of the law.

285
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,825
<i>That's the way I feel about it,
and that's the way I see it.</i>

286
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:52,530
But I had a couple of beers
one time with Scott Briggs,

287
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,099
and he told me
that all gays were evil.

288
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:58,369
So that's something
to think about.

289
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,572
Well, Sam, you're gonna
have to use old-fashioned

290
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,175
investigative techniques
on this one.

291
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:08,346
Really turn up
the heat on this.

292
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,915
But remember,
don't ever forget the obvious,

293
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,852
'cause those clues will lead you
where you need to be.

294
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,627
290, 290.
Good to see you, sheriff.

295
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,662
Enjoy. Enjoy.

296
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,531
Thanks for the good work.

297
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:30,701
You got a really good man here.
Yeah. Thank you.

298
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,236
Hey, kids.

299
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,078
Scott?

300
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,747
The kid is gone.

301
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,917
Those guys came back
and took him back to Mexico,

302
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,453
and I couldn't do
anything about it.

303
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:53,357
You stay up
with Buster tonight, okay?

304
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,927
- I'll take care of it, okay?
- Okay.

305
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,030
I'll take care of it,
all right?

306
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,532
I'll take care of it.

307
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,501
Yeah.

308
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,702
Yeah.

309
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,977
They took the kid back,
and now they're trying

310
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,278
to smuggle drugs over here.

311
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,215
<i>Those dirty sons of bitches.</i>

312
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,960
<i>You hear what I'm saying?!</i>

313
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,348
Good shot. Good shot.
Good shot.

314
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,851
Let's get out of here.
Terrific.

315
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:57,388
Great. Great.
Great. Great.

316
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,273
- Mrs. Payne.
- Hello, Mrs. Davis.

317
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,308
- How are you?
- Fine. Thank you.

318
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,190
- I would like to show you
my son's bedroom.
- Sure.

319
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,582
<i>His room seems more quiet</i>

320
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,784
<i>than the rest of the house.</i>

321
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,052
I sometimes...

322
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:31,188
I like to sit down

323
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,626
and...
think about the good times.

324
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,329
Your son seemed
to love water and horses.

325
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,630
<i>He loved to swim,</i>

326
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,100
<i>but the horses
were everything to him.</i>

327
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,536
How often did he visit
the Briggs ranch?

328
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,373
I really don't know.

329
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,743
What kind of relationship
did he have with Ben Briggs?

330
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,715
- They were very close.
- <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

331
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,784
But...

332
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:04,722
some people liked to say
it was more than that.

333
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:09,060
Was your son on antidepressant
medication?

334
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,762
Yes.

335
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,898
He was.

336
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,335
Did he try to commit suicide
prior to his disappearance?

337
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,075
Yes.

338
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,861
Do you mind
if I keep this picture?

339
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,063
- Take anything you need.
- <i> Thank you very much.</i>

340
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,568
- Okay.
- <i> Okay.</i>

341
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,870
<i>So I'll call you as soon
as I learn something.</i>

342
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,540
- Thank you very much.
You're so kind.
- Thank you.

343
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,956
Good morning.
Is Mr. Briggs in?

344
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,824
Good morning.
He'll be over in a minute.

345
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,293
- How can I help you?
- Are you the lady of the house?

346
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,497
No, I live with the family.
I have for years.

347
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,599
I help run things
around here.

348
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,734
Well, there's a lot to do
on a ranch this size.

349
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:28,105
- That's for sure.
- Maria, can I talk to you?

350
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,040
How you doing today?
Good?

351
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,442
Good morning, sir.

352
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:34,612
- My granddaughter Maddie.
- How are you?

353
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,247
<i>She can ride a horse,
let me tell you.</i>

354
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,582
Okay, go tell your brother,
I need him here

355
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,518
to do some work for one time,
okay, for once.

356
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,186
Kind of early, aren't you?

357
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,988
Nothing's too early
for me, sir.

358
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,056
No, I mean,
the cook-off's in two weeks.

359
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:50,194
- Well, that can wait.
- Mm-hmm, well,
what is it you came for?

360
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,830
I came to ask you about a man
that once worked here,

361
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,064
Pedro Alvarez.

362
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,434
I believe he used
to take care of your horses.

363
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,804
He did. He did.
What's it to you?

364
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:02,106
Well, it could
possibly mean a lot.

365
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,574
We reopened a case
of a young man

366
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:06,677
who disappeared 15 years ago,
Jimmy Davis.

367
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,547
Jimmy Davis.
Jimmy Davis.

368
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,383
How come I knew that as soon
as I heard a knock on the door?

369
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:15,653
I have no idea, sir.

370
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:17,054
Okay.

371
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,623
Good luck with your procedures,
but in the meantime,

372
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,493
I don't want anybody,
you know...

373
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,229
snooping around my property
asking questions

374
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,831
because this<i> is</i>
private property.

375
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,266
- I hope you understand that.
- I understand that.

376
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:31,869
And I respect your privacy.

377
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:35,306
Perhaps we can have a more
formal meeting in the future.

378
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:38,242
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps.

379
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,977
<i>Thank you.</i>

380
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,624
<i>So what do you want me
to do about it?</i>

381
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:57,127
Keep track of everything
she does.

382
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,697
What is "everything"?

383
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:02,933
"Everything"
means everything.

384
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,769
<i>Just keep her off her game,
whatever it takes.</i>

385
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:11,208
Within reason, okay?

386
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,511
- All right.
- <i> We'll talk later.</i>

387
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:14,979
All right.

388
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,618
Asshole.

389
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,922
Grandpa!

390
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,457
Grandpa!

391
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:32,062
Come on, Buster.
Let's go. Come on, buddy.

392
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,764
Yeah!

393
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:37,234
Thanks, man, for taking my kids
to my wife's house.

394
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:38,836
- Appreciate it.
- Maddie, Maddie.

395
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:42,239
I'll make some bunk beds.
You can stay forever.

396
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,642
- Give me a hug.
- Bye, grandpa.

397
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:47,244
- Love you.
- Love you too.

398
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,679
Okay.

399
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,282
Johnny have the horses ready.

400
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,617
Let me kiss you.

401
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,991
Tell your mom I love her, okay?
We'll be back together soon.

402
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,593
All right?

403
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,234
You, you be good.

404
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,405
Hey, Grandpa,
I'm a Texas Ranger.

405
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,440
If you don't let me
take over your ranch,

406
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,142
I'll arrest
your bow-legged ass.

407
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:20,344
I love you.

408
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,549
That little bastard.
He always get me.

409
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,018
Oh, shit.

410
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,890
Oh, come back soon.
Come back soon, right?

411
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:35,025
- I'll be damned, bye-bye.
- Bye.

412
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,831
All I've seen is this.
I don't wanna go crazy with it.

413
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,433
I just wanna
scare her out of here.

414
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,801
<i>Chica nuevos.</i>

415
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:46,604
What am I supposed
to feed my dogs?

416
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,739
Why don't you feed your dog
your tiny dick?

417
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:51,408
Yeah, man, this interaction
isn't for blood,

418
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,177
or it's not about money.

419
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,212
It's more about...

420
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,513
maybe we get a little pussy.

421
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,849
- Right?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

422
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,718
All right, everybody get
a shovel and dig your head

423
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,219
out of the pussy
'cause you can't see straight.

424
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,621
I'm talking to you about this.

425
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,422
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

426
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,292
<i>I'm saying no firearms.
There's gonna be no shooting.</i>

427
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,127
Right?
Just scare her. That's it.

428
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,096
I don't think
you understand, though.

429
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,098
What if she's shot?

430
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,699
That's not gonna be good for
any of us if she gets killed.

431
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,501
This is the Texas Rangers,
all right?

432
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:19,370
There's gonna be
repercussions for it.

433
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:20,704
But what if?

434
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:22,606
If she gets killed,
then I suggest

435
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,642
you get across
the river back to Mexico.

436
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,677
You can go to goddamn China,
wherever you want to.

437
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,879
I'm asking you
you in or are you out?

438
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,516
Are you in or are you out?

439
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:34,084
I'll find somebody else
like<i> that.</i>

440
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,420
- You in...
- You know what? I'm in.

441
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,155
- All right.
- Okay.

442
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,690
All right.

443
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,392
And you're out.

444
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,427
Okay. Let's go.
We're done.

445
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,799
<i>Haven't talked
in nine and a half years, okay?</i>

446
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,868
<i>How many you put
in the ground since then?</i>

447
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,604
<i>Only... only two, huh?
Better than I am.</i>

448
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:56,206
Listen to me, for once.

449
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,776
Listen to me.

450
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:02,813
I... I need...
I need...

451
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,915
All right, okay, I need...

452
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,951
Yeah,
I need Ben to call Maria.

453
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,320
It's very,
very important, all right?

454
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,092
City boy.
Look who's here.

455
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:50,461
Coming here to drag us
into the 21st Century or what?

456
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,762
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

457
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:53,263
- Good to see you
- Good to see you, too.

458
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,799
Maria, hi.

459
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,602
- Johnny.
- Good to see you.

460
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,776
Pop.

461
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,979
Man, boy, good to see you.
Welcome home.

462
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,615
I'm here to see my brothers
and Maria

463
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,951
and take care of that will.

464
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:17,321
Yeah, well, that's the only way
I could get you to come here.

465
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,523
Through Maria.

466
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:23,327
Maria knows best.
She's the boss.

467
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,728
<i>Welcome home.</i>

468
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,765
Your... your room's
is waiting on you, okay?

469
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,668
I remember where it is.

470
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,771
- See you up there.
- <i> See you.</i>

471
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,406
Good to see you, son.

472
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,545
Thank you, Lord Jesus.

473
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:42,846
<i>How are you?</i>

474
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,548
<i>I'm good, how are you?</i>

475
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,649
<i>How's the family?</i>

476
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,684
Uh, the family?

477
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,220
Well, you know my mom died
seven years ago.

478
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:53,724
- Mm-hmm.
- And, well, my father,

479
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,659
he left,
and I never heard from him.

480
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,728
- Mm.
- You know, he vanished.

481
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,796
Yeah.

482
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,765
But you're my family, so.

483
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,902
You look good.
You look very handsome.

484
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,670
Have you been eating well?

485
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,872
Yeah.

486
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,275
I don't know if I'm gonna...

487
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,943
- go eat dinner.
- What?

488
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:15,479
I'm just gonna stay here,
maybe take a walk.

489
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,914
No.

490
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,715
It's weird.
It's weird.

491
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,385
<i>No, it's not weird,
and supper's ready,</i>

492
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:24,087
and I'm gonna sit with you,
and everything's gonna be fine.

493
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,290
- You're gonna sit with me?
- Of course.

494
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,091
<i>I'll be next to you.</i>

495
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,427
If you sit next to me,
then I'll go.

496
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:31,695
Yes.

497
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:32,830
<i>Yeah?</i>

498
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,731
I missed you so much.

499
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,201
<i>You're the brother
I never had.</i>

500
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,236
Yeah.

501
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,704
I'm lying.

502
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,174
I think I always had
a crush on you.

503
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,475
Oh, really?

504
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,810
<i>Really.</i>

505
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,712
Well, I wish I had known that
earlier.

506
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:51,782
We could have saved
a lot of problems.

507
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:55,819
Yeah, I think so.

508
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,988
Let's go.
Come on.

509
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,625
- I'll help you with that later.
- All right.

510
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,598
Hello. Welcome.

511
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,133
Hey, Johnny, how are you doing
out Atlanta all day?

512
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,835
God dang,
I heard a lot about you.

513
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,503
Good to finally meet you.

514
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,973
<i>Everybody sit down.</i>

515
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,608
Known your old daddy a while.

516
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,576
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

517
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:23,013
I'd just like to say
that I'm very...

518
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,716
I'm very pleased and moved,
I really am,

519
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:29,486
that my sons, my three sons
the first time in many years

520
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,821
are being here together,

521
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,956
and it makes me very,
very happy.

522
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,359
<i>And very emotional.
Okay?</i>

523
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:39,062
Benny, I'm so happy
that he's here.

524
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,699
I am very happy.
But are we okay for now?

525
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:44,902
<i>Are we okay for now?</i>

526
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,637
- Are we okay?
- Yeah. I'm asking you.

527
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,971
Yeah, we're okay, dad.

528
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,073
- Okay, good.
- It's good to be here.

529
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,376
- Yeah.
- It's great to see y'all.

530
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,845
So did you meet LD?
He's been my partner.

531
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,247
- All right.
-<i> Ben, good to meet you.</i>
<i>Heard a little bit about you.</i>

532
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,182
Pretty crappy
business partner.

533
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,485
Hadn't earned me a damn cent,
but he's...

534
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:05,722
I've been saving that for you.
I'm holding it for your boy.

535
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,591
Yay!

536
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,795
I'm not used to saying grace,

537
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,997
but maybe we should say
a little grace.

538
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,632
Maybe somebody
should say some.

539
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,701
KC or...

540
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,569
yeah, you or which.

541
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,906
<i>Come on.
Somebody.</i>

542
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,808
There's no before
and there's no after.

543
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,843
There's only now and love.

544
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,379
So let us love each other
like Jesus said.

545
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,082
<i>I love Jesus,
but I like to drink a little.</i>

546
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,184
Let us pray
for our brother Ben.

547
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,187
Give him love
and welcome him home.

548
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,088
Thank you.

549
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,357
And the food, too.
Amen.

550
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,992
- Amen.
- <i> Amen.</i>

551
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,861
Yeah, now
we got a surprise for you.

552
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,563
Okay, I'm ready.

553
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:47,965
Milo?

554
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:52,502
<i>Come on.</i>

555
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,572
- Oh, no!
- <i> Good God!</i>

556
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,807
Oh, wow.

557
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,475
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

558
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,743
<i>What do you got there,
Milo?</i>

559
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:03,914
This was my favorite kid goat.

560
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,549
That was your favorite goat?

561
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:06,750
What was his named?

562
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,286
His name, uh, is Billy.

563
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,322
- Billy Goat.
- That was Billy.

564
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,724
In honor...

565
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,293
In honor
of Benny's homecoming,

566
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:19,730
Benny, I cooked him
especially for you.

567
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:22,399
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, Milo.
Can't wait to dig in.

568
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,468
I'm glad you kept
the teeth in that.

569
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,071
Applause for Milo.

570
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,435
- Where you going, Benny?
Where you going?
- I'll be back.

571
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:03,073
- I'll be back.
I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

572
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,875
<i>He said he'll be back,
Pop.</i>

573
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,283
- <i> Hola.</i>
- Hey.

574
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,451
Thank you.

575
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,155
- You okay?
- Yeah.

576
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,823
Did you have a good time?

577
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,827
It was all right.

578
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,963
Oh, gosh.

579
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,332
Freak show.

580
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,276
What are you doing?

581
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,778
Dance with me.

582
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,847
No. No.

583
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,849
Your father dances with me.

584
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,784
- What?
- Yeah.

585
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:48,952
My dad dances with you?

586
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,253
Yeah, like...

587
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,023
No, no, no, no, no.

588
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,759
- Like this?
- Yeah, I swear.

589
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,838
That's my daddy.

590
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,041
Let me dance with you!

591
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,923
I'd rather dance
with my horse!

592
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,147
He's in love with that horse.

593
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,916
Almost love you
as much as my horse, Maria!

594
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:06,196
<i>Dad, what you did to me
that night...</i>

595
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:10,734
I'll never forget it,
and I'll never understand it.

596
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:15,639
You told me to read the Bible,
and I did.

597
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,475
Leviticus.

598
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,744
Is it worse for two men
to lie together

599
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:24,381
or for King David
to send a man to battle to die

600
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,217
so that he can lay
with his wife?

601
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,752
What's worse?

602
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,194
Nothing to say?

603
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,335
You always protected yourself
with silence.

604
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,439
I guess you still do.

605
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,321
<i>It turns out
that Pedro Alvarez</i>

606
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,756
<i>stays at
Isabel's Convenience Store,</i>

607
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,025
<i>and I really need
to speak with him.</i>

608
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:11,294
He's Isabel's relative.

609
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,897
I would like to go to Linda Rosa
to meet with them.

610
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,399
<i>Okay, I'll arrange
for Rogers to go with you.</i>

611
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,034
<i>He knows the town well.</i>

612
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,737
- I don't need that clown, sir.
- <i> No, you go with him.</i>

613
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,440
- Yes, sir. Okay.
-<i> Did you get that car</i>
<i>for Cody?</i>

614
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,342
<i>Yeah,
I'm driving Cody's new car,</i>

615
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,143
<i>and I think
he's going to like it.</i>

616
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,246
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

617
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:31,014
<i>I just got shot at,
sir.</i>

618
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,890
Dad...

619
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,526
where's Jimmy?

620
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:32,529
What happened to him?

621
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,697
I have no idea whatsoever.

622
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,700
- He's around, huh?
- Absolutely.

623
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,537
I'm only concerned about you
and the rest of us,

624
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,238
- the family, that's it.
- The family?

625
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,474
Yeah, what there is of it,
yeah.

626
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:51,514
I've been going a little
downhill since you left.

627
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,450
I feel better now.

628
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:02,492
I think back
to this particular time...

629
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,697
when I got bucked off a horse,
and you told me to get back on,

630
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,366
and...

631
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:13,636
you did it in such
a kind way, I...

632
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,405
I just like to think about it

633
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:19,843
'cause it kind of offsets
what happened.

634
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:23,112
It's not enough
to make me forget,

635
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,315
but it helps a little bit.

636
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,518
Yeah.

637
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,620
Thank you, son.

638
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:33,223
Come in, fellas.

639
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,670
Okay.

640
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,432
<i>Special day.
Special day.</i>

641
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,009
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

642
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,110
<i>Have a seat.</i>

643
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,115
<i>Maria,
come over here.</i>

644
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,418
<i>Over here.</i>

645
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,288
You're late.

646
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,823
You're always late.

647
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:08,291
Sorry.

648
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:09,526
Yeah. Okay.

649
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:13,096
<i>There you go, darlin'.</i>

650
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:16,332
-<i> Your dad wanted me to go over</i>
<i>a few things...</i>
- Hold on.

651
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,568
How come we're here like this?

652
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,338
A will is a totally
private family thing, right?

653
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,941
- Private?
-<i> That's what I was</i>
<i>about to explain to you,</i>

654
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,876
if you'd just
give me a second.

655
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:33,016
Okay, go ahead.

656
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:36,019
<i>Your dad wanted everybody
here together as family</i>

657
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,821
because he wanted the entire
family to understand everything.

658
00:42:38,823 --> 00:42:40,924
He wanted... he wanted it
all out in the open.

659
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,693
- <i> Is that right, Scott?</i>
- Yes, sir.

660
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:47,931
So we've laid out
a very simple plan.

661
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:52,135
Basically, the 40,000 acres
be broken up equally

662
00:42:52,137 --> 00:42:53,603
in four ways.

663
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,338
What are you talking about,
four ways?

664
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,740
Pop.
Hold on a second here.

665
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:00,710
No, no, no, no.
Let him finish, all right?

666
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:03,813
Go head, John.
Let him finish.

667
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,482
<i>Your dad's laid it out
in very simple terms,</i>

668
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,618
laid it out very nicely.

669
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,154
10,000 acres
to each of the boys,

670
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:15,592
10,000 acres and the ranch house
to Maria Anna Gonzalez.

671
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,694
Pop, Pop...

672
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,729
<i>I know what you're gonna say.</i>

673
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,231
Right, Maria's not
a part of this family.

674
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,833
- Not really.
<i>- I know.</i>

675
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,568
- Right, Maria?
- <i> I know.</i>

676
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,936
- <i> This is a family deal here.</i>
- I know.

677
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,205
I love Maria,
you know we all do,

678
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,975
- like a sister, but, Dad...
- Hold on a minute.

679
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,177
As I said before,

680
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:38,181
this is probably
the happiest day of my life

681
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:41,050
as well as the toughest.

682
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:44,020
I'd like to say she's
not just like a sister to you.

683
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,124
Excuse me.

684
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,261
She<i> is</i> your sister.

685
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,868
Jesus.

686
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,704
And a daughter
that I care for and love

687
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,640
maybe more than anyone.

688
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,174
I want you all to know that.

689
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:07,210
<i>All right?</i>

690
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,416
Maria?

691
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,354
Explain yourself.

692
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:21,858
I can't right now.
I can't.

693
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,494
Any further questions
at the moment,

694
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,196
you can ask John.

695
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,431
I have to...

696
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,239
get some fresh air.

697
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:43,579
We can talk later, Maria,
if you'd like.

698
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:46,015
But, uh...

699
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:50,753
in the meantime,
I want you all to remember this.

700
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:52,789
This is your sister.

701
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,993
She's blood now.

702
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,870
Well.

703
00:45:11,443 --> 00:45:14,610
Maria.

704
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,480
Welcome to the family.

705
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:19,849
Come here.
Come here.

706
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:23,953
<i>Come here.
Come here.</i>

707
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,291
- I...
- Come here.

708
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,594
I'm just glad I'm gay,

709
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:33,636
otherwise I would've
married my sister.

710
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,125
She still in there?

711
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,093
Of course
she's still in there.

712
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,062
She's waiting.

713
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:09,932
She... she didn't go out
the other door?

714
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:15,171
Hey, Pop.
This is the only door.

715
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,006
Okay.

716
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:21,544
Yeah. All right.
I guess I better go back in.

717
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:24,781
Think I should?

718
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:27,517
Yeah, I think so.

719
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:30,286
All right. Okay.

720
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,497
Well, looks like we got
us a beautiful Mexican sister

721
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,899
and a homosexual brother.

722
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,701
You call it "gay," Johnny.

723
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:48,437
I don't know about that.

724
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,411
We'll figure it out.

725
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:01,384
Hey.

726
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,360
If you hadn't given her
10,000 acres,

727
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:15,264
I would have given her mine,
and I still might.

728
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,110
I don't understand.

729
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,748
Why was I always treated
like a daughter,

730
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,350
but never told
I<i> was</i> a daughter?

731
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,352
That's beyond me.

732
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,788
Yeah,
I know it makes sense to you,

733
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,456
but certainly not to me.

734
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,131
And who was Tomás?
Just a make-believe father?

735
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:53,469
Maybe he ran off,
left your mother.

736
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,071
<i>I wonder why.</i>

737
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,779
So why are you telling me now?

738
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,314
Why what?

739
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:08,751
Why didn't you tell me
long before this?

740
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,353
Were you ashamed?

741
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:13,723
Why would I be ashamed?

742
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,157
You're my daughter.

743
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,594
I don't know.

744
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,196
You seem to have
all the answers.

745
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:24,567
Are you ashamed
because I am the product

746
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,737
of your unwed Mexican maid?

747
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,505
Might that have
something to do with...

748
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:33,242
Listen... no listen to me.
I loved your mother. I did.

749
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,511
You didn't answer my question.

750
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:38,681
<i>It didn't look right</i>

751
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,284
in this particular
community of yours.

752
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:42,451
Is that it?

753
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,322
Maybe.

754
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:48,758
There doesn't seem
to be a maybe here.

755
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,127
Yes or no.

756
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:56,832
<i>Yes or no.</i>

757
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,735
Hey, I'm a coward.

758
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,971
Oh, yes, you are.

759
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:05,041
Don't play the victim
on me here now.

760
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:08,110
It's too late for that.

761
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:13,049
Well, I hope someday
that I can be forgiven.

762
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:16,285
Oh, please.
Don't do that.

763
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,157
If I ever decide
to forgive anybody,

764
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:24,994
it would be me who decides,
not you.

765
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,730
This one time,
my dear father,

766
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:30,466
you can't decide.

767
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,001
I won't let you.

768
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,076
Go home and rest.

769
00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:42,211
I'm sure you need it.
I have things to do.

770
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,793
Is that like... is that like
a southern turn-on?

771
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,703
Did we ever play
smear the queer with you?

772
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,138
- What...
- Did we?

773
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,607
What the eff
is smear the queer?

774
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,343
- Smear the queer, man.
- What is that game?
Tell me about that game.

775
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,879
Cow patty on your face
with a bamboo stick.

776
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:19,148
Actually, you know what?
I think you did.

777
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,284
- And that's why I turned gay.
- I think that's probably why.

778
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,919
I think you turned me gay,
brother.

779
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:25,788
- No way.
- Yeah.

780
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,456
Thank you.

781
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,026
- He says gay.
How do you call it?
- Yeah.

782
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:32,094
<i>I say why can't
you just say "homosexual"?</i>

783
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,063
Sometimes,
we pronounce it "g'ay."

784
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,998
<i>G'ay?
That's like you're choking?</i>

785
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,300
What is that?
G'ay?

786
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,703
You lost it.
You drank way too much, Johnny.

787
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,638
Johnny,
ignorant son of a bitch.

788
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,475
- Just shut your trap.
Shut your trap.
- I wanna know!

789
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,911
What do you wanna know?
Tell me what you wanna know.

790
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:50,946
Who gets on top first?

791
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:53,215
- <i> What?</i>
- Who swings the bat?

792
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,084
- <i> No, I'll lay it out.</i>
- Oh, Jesus.

793
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:57,053
- Who gets on top first?
- Yeah.

794
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,589
Well, we flip a coin.
That's how we do it.

795
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:01,891
Sometimes, Rochambeau.

796
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,592
- Rochambeau?
- <i> Rochambeau.</i>

797
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:07,263
- What does that mean?
- Paper, rock, scissors.

798
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:09,331
<i>"I'm a dumb
redneck heterosexual."</i>

799
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:12,768
What's the dirtiest,
wildest sex you ever had?

800
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,538
Shit.

801
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,106
Johnny, stop.
Stop!

802
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:19,341
Hey,
knock it off over there.

803
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,746
It's not a library, man!

804
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,948
- All right, come on.
- Shut up!

805
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,150
- Or you come over here
and I'll kick your ass.
- Let's get out of here.

806
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:30,820
Come on. Come on.
Come on, Johnny.

807
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,223
All right, all right.

808
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,863
Hey,
stick it up your ass, pal!

809
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:42,298
<i>Hey, he didn't mean it.</i>

810
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,060
- You!
- Come on, come on.

811
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,505
Hey, hey, hey,
you all right?

812
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:53,242
- Take a couple of deep
breaths. Walk it off.
- Come here, come here.

813
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,911
Fresh air.
Getting excited.

814
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,047
Hey, jackass.
You want a piece of me?

815
00:51:58,049 --> 00:51:59,982
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah?

816
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:02,284
- Yeah.
- I'm not talking to you,
asshole.

817
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,386
- Yeah, you're talking to me.
- Who's the asshole?

818
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:06,422
I got this. I got this.
I got this.

819
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:09,544
- Back off, man, I'm not
talking to you, little faggot.
- What?

820
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,439
- Who's the faggot now, huh?!
- Yeah, get out of here!

821
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:26,208
- Get out of here!
- Come on.

822
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,777
<i>Get the fuck out of here.</i>

823
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,819
That was awesome!
You're starting trouble, man!

824
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:45,027
Awesome.
You were a buzz saw in there.

825
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:47,363
- Thank you, sir.
- Papa's right.

826
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:50,032
You must have been a hell
of a street fighter

827
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,233
when you were younger.

828
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,002
Yeah, pop taught me
a thing or two.

829
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:54,503
I was a little off my game.

830
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,639
I got bumped into something,
but how'd I do?

831
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,574
Oh, you were an animal.

832
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,709
You weren't worth a shit
even though you started it.

833
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:04,613
- Come on, man!
- You weren't worth shit!

834
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,215
I thought I got someone.

835
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:09,051
You remind me of pop
a little bit sometimes.

836
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:10,519
How's that?

837
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,122
I was told when my pop
was a young man,

838
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:14,890
he'd got in a fight
with the sheriff

839
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:17,626
and knocked that guy on his ass
in front of a bunch of people

840
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,662
on account of a guy
called him a draft dodger

841
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,030
during the Korean War.

842
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:23,065
Guy never mentioned anything
to pops again.

843
00:53:23,067 --> 00:53:25,935
- Never said shit.
- I believe that.

844
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:27,536
Chip off the old block,
both of you.

845
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,658
- What happened to you?
- I don't know, man.

846
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:34,076
- A lover of all things.
- A gentle heterosexual.

847
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:36,178
Straight.
Straight.

848
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,281
<i>- Go, go, go, go.
- Go get him, Cody!</i>

849
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:41,417
<i>Get him, boy!</i>

850
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,562
- All right.
- Way to go, Cody.

851
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:55,731
Good job.

852
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:59,301
<i>Good roping today.
Your dad would be proud.</i>

853
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,503
So how come you never
talk about your father?

854
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:04,406
Every time his name comes up,
you change the subject.

855
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,175
Why?

856
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:08,711
Because he was
a very violent man,

857
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,680
and at the same time,
I love him very much.

858
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,148
What do you mean?

859
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,651
What do I mean?

860
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:18,354
Hmm.

861
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:22,791
Well,
last time I saw him,

862
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:27,029
he came storming
into the kitchen like a maniac,

863
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:30,866
and you never knew
what set him off...

864
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:35,571
and as violent as you can
imagine a man can be.

865
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,840
And...

866
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,276
you can only see his hand...

867
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:44,346
going to my throat,
and then you feel the wall.

868
00:54:44,348 --> 00:54:47,549
And I was just so tired
of being afraid,

869
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,186
so tired that I decided that

870
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:52,821
that was going to be it.

871
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:01,830
So I stare at him.

872
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,908
And I said,
"Well, go for it."

873
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,140
I said, "Go for it."

874
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:14,243
And you can see his fist
going by my face

875
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:15,911
and hitting the wall.

876
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:22,384
And I opened my eyes,
and I stare at him,

877
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:25,321
and he looked like a...
demon,

878
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,022
and, um...

879
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,958
And he just walk away.

880
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,760
And that was it.

881
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,031
We're set.
You ready?

882
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:37,099
<i>Yeah.</i>

883
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:39,001
Let's go.

884
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,402
Give me a hug.

885
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:43,706
Oh, I love you so much.

886
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,907
So much.

887
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,111
Lock the doors.

888
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:41,964
We're closed,
but how can I help you?

889
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:43,198
<i>Hello, Mrs. Isabel?</i>

890
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,466
Yes?

891
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,535
Hi, I'm looking
for Eduardo Valdez.

892
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:48,170
<i>And who wants to know?</i>

893
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,638
We do,
the Texas Rangers.

894
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,875
Well, he's not here.
He comes and goes.

895
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,276
Oh, I see.

896
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:55,844
Should I tell him that
you are looking for him?

897
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,447
Yes, please.
I just left my business card.

898
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,449
If he can call me
whenever he has a chance,

899
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,484
- I will really appreciate it.
- <i> I'll do that.</i>

900
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,286
Thank you very much, ma'am.
Have a good night.

901
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,788
- You're welcome, good night.
- Good night.

902
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,890
Be careful out there,
it's kinda dangerous.

903
00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:10,526
- Yeah, take care yourself. Bye.
- Thank you.

904
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,029
I went to Joe's Bar.

905
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:17,299
Bartender told me there was
a in town,

906
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:20,002
a new guy,
so I followed him out,

907
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,503
pulled him over.

908
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:23,505
That's not bad
for a new guy.

909
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:25,674
- Yeah?
- <i> Yeah.</i>

910
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:28,544
- Looks great.
- Squeezing on it like it's
a pair of titties

911
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,979
ain't gonna get you
any closer to getting a job.

912
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:32,848
- Yeah.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

913
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:09,444
<i>- Listen, man...
- Hey, man. Hey, man...</i>

914
00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:10,712
<i>We talk about business here.</i>

915
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,881
This stuff in your hand
has no value.

916
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:13,916
No value?

917
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,751
Why are you here
if it has no value?

918
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:17,286
<i>How are we gonna sell that?</i>

919
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:18,854
<i>Let me make a point to you.</i>

920
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:21,456
<i>You're fighting
for 70% of this, yeah?</i>

921
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:25,894
<i>You want 70% of zero,
nothing, nada?</i>

922
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:28,597
<i>Or you want 60% of this?
It's your call.</i>

923
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,966
<i>What do you want?</i>

924
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:34,303
I want 40% instead of 30.
I'm not doing 30.

925
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:37,439
No way, man.
No way, asshole.

926
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,840
Hey, we can talk.

927
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:40,809
You don't have to call me
an asshole.

928
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:43,512
Call me asshole again, I'm gonna
slap you in the goddamn mouth.

929
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:45,213
- Just give it a try.
- Just talk.

930
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,783
You want to do business,
to business, but just talk.

931
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,986
- You need me to sell stuff.
- I don't need you.
I need somebody to sell stuff.

932
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:52,688
<i>You think I can't get
somebody else,</i>

933
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,556
you're wrong, my friend,
you're wrong about that.

934
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:56,291
- Mm-hmm.
- 40.

935
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,842
All right.
Let's do the deal, asshole.

936
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,813
That comes out your end.

937
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:19,815
Look my face of concern.

938
01:00:19,817 --> 01:00:23,018
Look your face of concern.

939
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,020
- All right.
- Look my face of celebration.

940
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:27,356
- <i> All right. Good.</i>
- Yeah, 40. Deal.

941
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,858
<i>Hey, Sheriff, what's your 20?</i>

942
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,760
<i>67 and 11.</i>

943
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,595
<i>Okay, good.
You're right behind me.</i>

944
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:35,530
<i>Listen,
I got a text from Sam.</i>

945
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,032
<i>It was real vague,
but apparently,</i>

946
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,967
<i>she stumbled on a drug deal
going down</i>

947
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,737
<i>at that warehouse in Minarosa.</i>

948
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,639
<i>You gotta know this...</i>

949
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:47,476
<i>Your Deputy Rogers
is inside that building.</i>

950
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:48,944
<i>10-4</i>

951
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,552
Here you go.

952
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,989
<i>You got a girl?</i>

953
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,524
<i>No.</i>

954
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:37,926
You seem sad about it.

955
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:39,895
- It's not our business, man.
- <i> Huh?</i>

956
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,797
- That's not our business.
- <i> You want to talk business,</i>

957
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:43,832
let's talk about the $1,000
you owe me that I paid you

958
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,333
<i>to scare a Ranger
and nothing happened.</i>

959
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:47,569
- <i> What? What? What?</i>
- What do you want?

960
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,338
Want a refund or a credit store
or something?

961
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,873
- Who?
- <i> A store credit.</i>

962
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,042
- In English. What's that?
- A store credit.

963
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,545
- Store credit?
- Yeah. How about that?

964
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,547
That's business,
what you want to talk about.

965
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:01,216
All right, man,
take from the cut.

966
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,720
- All right? No worries.
- No worries.

967
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,660
It's a good thing for you
and me both

968
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,895
- that kid got killed, too.
- I know.

969
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,430
You'd be in prison...

970
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,937
- Let me see your hands.
- Down, down, down, down!

971
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,739
- Hands behind your back.
- Don't move.

972
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,007
Y'all got here two seconds later
I don't know what.

973
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,309
Asshole.

974
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,747
Yesterday, you were teaching
these kids about drugs,

975
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,381
and now you're
doing this shit?

976
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:34,883
<i>Si!</i>

977
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,623
I don't know who you're
working for, asshole,

978
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,658
but you're a disgrace
to our profession.

979
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,527
- You understand?
- Answer him.

980
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:48,964
- Yes, sir!
- Get your ass up.

981
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:50,966
Get this crap up around here.

982
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,945
Come here. Sit up.

983
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,814
Sit up.

984
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,555
I'll say it again.
There's no Pedro Alvarez.

985
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:15,437
I'd hit the road
if I were you.

986
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,130
Whatever you say, bud.

987
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,389
Thank you, Mrs. Isabel.
Thank you for helping us.

988
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,357
Oh, you're welcome.

989
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,565
The one that lived in Mexico
and now you live here?

990
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:03,738
Back and forth.

991
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:07,008
I'm with the Texas Rangers,
Mr. Alvarez.

992
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,011
And I came to ask you
about Ben and Scott Briggs.

993
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,696
Do you know what happened
to Jimmy Davis

994
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:29,598
who took care of
Briggs' horses?

995
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,803
In my pueblo,

996
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:38,039
there is little...
This little tiny bird

997
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,876
that is brilliant red...

998
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,712
<i>Rojo, rojo...</i>

999
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:47,082
Red with little black wings.

1000
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:49,985
He flies up
and down the canyon.

1001
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:53,455
And what does he do
all day long?

1002
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,327
He lives to catch flies.

1003
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:13,108
<i>Can you help us?</i>

1004
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,522
I am very sorry
it didn't work out.

1005
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,557
I'm sorry.

1006
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:30,992
<i>Don't feel bad.</i>

1007
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,700
This generation of Mexicans
hate the Texas Rangers.

1008
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,036
I know.

1009
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,382
Hello, Mr. Scott.

1010
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:57,719
The Texas Ranger Samantha Payne
is waiting in your office.

1011
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:59,254
Oh...

1012
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:02,090
Well, just open the floodgates,
you idiot.

1013
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:03,692
Open the floodgates!

1014
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,070
Please be seated.

1015
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,112
What can I do for you?

1016
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:27,282
<i>I came to ask you
about Jimmy Davis.</i>

1017
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:29,451
Jimmy Davis?
What about him?

1018
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:32,287
Did you know that your son
and Jimmy Davis had an affair?

1019
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:36,157
No, no, that never happened.
That's just small-town rumors.

1020
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,599
That confirms
that they did have an affair.

1021
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,267
So?

1022
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:49,604
<i>I believe his disappearance
was a hate crime.</i>

1023
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:50,972
A hate crime?

1024
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:58,947
How long you been doing
your job, young lady?

1025
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:00,915
Because you have a picture
of a man who is missing,

1026
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,785
you come to the simple
conclusion that me

1027
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,153
or anyone out here
had anything to do

1028
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,122
<i>with this man's disappearance.</i>

1029
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:11,393
You can't go and start arresting
people anywhere you look.

1030
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:13,895
I mean,
everybody has someone to hate.

1031
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:16,664
I have someone.
You have someone.

1032
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:21,236
And let me tell you something.
The Mexicans hate the blacks.

1033
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:25,440
The blacks hate the white.
My white neighbor hates women.

1034
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:28,176
And my liberal lawyer hates
my Republican friends,

1035
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:32,080
and my Republican friends hate
my liberal lawyer.

1036
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:35,050
But the work gets done.

1037
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:40,655
Do you have anything to do with
Jimmy Davis' disappearance, sir?

1038
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:45,326
I have never done
anything to that man,

1039
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:49,431
and if you think I have,
then what can I say?

1040
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,533
<i>I understand
you have made comments</i>

1041
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:55,370
that you do believe
that gay people are evil.

1042
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:58,807
Those are strong feelings
of hate, Mr. Briggs,

1043
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:00,542
and hate can bring confusion
to a man

1044
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:03,545
that wants to control everything
and everyone around him.

1045
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:07,549
I believe in justice
just like everyone else.

1046
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,850
Do you, Mr. Briggs?

1047
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:11,319
Yes, I do.
Now please leave my office.

1048
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,857
I met with Pedro Alvarez.

1049
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,359
Pedro Alvarez.

1050
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,161
Pedro Alvarez.

1051
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:21,796
And what did he say?

1052
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:26,067
He said plenty.

1053
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:28,636
He said what?

1054
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,810
Who lets the Texas Rangers
onto my property?!

1055
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:38,646
Who does that?
My goddamn cook!

1056
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:41,182
<i>He not only cooks the soup
and my fried chicken</i>

1057
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:44,252
and lets anybody onto
my property that he wants me to!

1058
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:46,321
I don't get it!
I don't get it!

1059
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:50,925
You know, they arrested
that Rogers guy in a drug bust.

1060
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,193
<i>They what?</i>

1061
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:54,796
Yeah,
they got him in custody.

1062
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,099
- They got him.
- Okay, now, you listen to me
and listen good.

1063
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,934
I don't want some
cheap Texas Ranger bitch

1064
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,804
roaming around this property
asking a bunch of questions.

1065
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,173
I don't want her on this
property or anywhere near!

1066
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:08,510
You hear me?! Nowhere!
If she does, only I talk to her!

1067
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:11,012
You understand?
Only me! Only me!

1068
01:09:11,014 --> 01:09:13,414
<i>Where's Ben?
He's never around here.</i>

1069
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,116
- <i> Where's Ben?</i>
- She's just doing her job.

1070
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:17,018
What are you getting
so worked up for?

1071
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,087
- Give her a pass.
- Give her a pass?

1072
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:21,156
For what,
you friggin' retard?

1073
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:23,558
You friggin' retard!
Give her a pass.

1074
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,726
Who's the retard?

1075
01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:26,594
We invited her
to the barbecue next week.

1076
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:29,097
- <i> Who invited?</i>
- Not me, old man, not me.

1077
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:31,199
- You did.
- Then uninvite her.

1078
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:33,468
Get her on the phone
this goddamn minute

1079
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,837
and uninvite
that sneaking bitch!

1080
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,539
- You hear me?
- No way.

1081
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,841
- What do you mean no way?
- No way, you do it.

1082
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:44,212
Oh, I do what you...
Oh, you thimble-headed redneck

1083
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,781
son of a bitch.

1084
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:50,018
Yeah? Yeah?
Step up!

1085
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,986
Now, listen to me...
I don't want that bitch

1086
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:53,888
anywhere around me,
you understand me?

1087
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,390
Nowhere around me.

1088
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:58,193
Now...

1089
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,962
clean all this shit up,
clean it up before supper.

1090
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:03,064
Clean it up yourself,
you asshole.

1091
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:06,701
Kiss my ass 27 times,
you prick.

1092
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:10,805
Speak up, Johnny.
You never say anything.

1093
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:12,240
Get out of my way.

1094
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:26,588
Don't you pick it up.
Don't you pick it up.

1095
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,898
<i>I wanna ask you
about Jimmy Davis.</i>

1096
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,434
Sure.

1097
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,169
What do you want to know?

1098
01:10:41,171 --> 01:10:43,638
You were having an affair
with Jimmy Davis.

1099
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,642
Well,
that's nobody's business.

1100
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:51,045
I'm not here to judge you,
Mr. Briggs.

1101
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,380
Mm-hmm.

1102
01:10:52,382 --> 01:10:54,015
I'm sure it was
very difficult for you

1103
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:56,918
to be a gay man in a town
of machos like the one we're in.

1104
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,622
It's like you'd expect.
I pretended to be straight.

1105
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:01,823
Uh-huh.

1106
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,259
I made sure to date
the prettiest girls.

1107
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:06,828
I was the one to always
start the fights

1108
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,197
- so no one's starting with me.
- Mm-hmm.

1109
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,934
Just pray to be like
everyone wanted me to be.

1110
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,671
How'd your father react
when he learned you were guy?

1111
01:11:16,673 --> 01:11:21,109
My father is a tough guy.
And you can't tell him anything.

1112
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:24,545
But my mother...

1113
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:27,248
she told me
to go live my life.

1114
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,785
Some people,
they'll never accept it.

1115
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:32,220
That's true.

1116
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:34,088
<i>That's true.</i>

1117
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:38,359
Was anybody with you and Jimmy
the last time you saw him?

1118
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,461
The last time I saw him?

1119
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,930
- <i> Yeah, was anybody with you?</i>
- No.

1120
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,372
- No?
- No.

1121
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,872
Do you believe that blood
runs thicker than truth, sir?

1122
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:59,047
No. I don't know why you're
asking me that, but no.

1123
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:00,748
It's okay.

1124
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,917
I found this.

1125
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:31,946
Anybody out there?

1126
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:33,781
Who's hungry?

1127
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,470
She's got me.

1128
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,141
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

1129
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:01,876
Who's there?

1130
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,444
<i>Red.</i>

1131
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:06,647
Red? Red who?

1132
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:11,352
Your redneck prick
son of a bitch son, that's who.

1133
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:15,423
What do you want smashed
before you pick it up, huh?

1134
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:18,265
- You want this?
- Pick your spot,
pick your spot.

1135
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:23,398
Yeah.

1136
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,435
I missed you guys at supper.
Where's Johnny at?

1137
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:29,137
Johnny's getting divorced,
Pop.

1138
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:32,573
Tell him not to worry.
It's not the end of the world.

1139
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,809
Probably best not
to tell him anything.

1140
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:37,712
No, you're right,
you're right.

1141
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:41,682
So this whole little court
chitchat gets caught up, okay?

1142
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:44,485
- I gotta get going.
- What do you mean?
You just got here.

1143
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:46,687
I'll see you in the morning.
We can bust up more shit.

1144
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,523
- Who's gonna clean it up?
- You are?

1145
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:51,292
- Me? Oh, bullshit.
- Walk me to the door.

1146
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:54,128
All right.
Hold on, hold on.

1147
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,897
<i>Oh, yeah,
I wanna ask you,</i>

1148
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:59,200
things with Sandy
are better, I hope.

1149
01:13:59,202 --> 01:14:01,169
Better. Thanks.

1150
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:03,905
Yeah. Good girl.

1151
01:14:03,907 --> 01:14:05,773
Don't let her go, son.

1152
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:08,042
She's too good,
tell you that.

1153
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:10,244
- She's great.
- Yeah.

1154
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,813
I finally cut off
that other deal.

1155
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:14,782
I gotta stay
at what's right for me.

1156
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,452
Can't let it be said
that the apple or whatever

1157
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:19,020
doesn't fall far
from the tree.

1158
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:24,125
Yeah, right, hey, hey,
hey, hey, get out of here.

1159
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,727
- Right.
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

1160
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:27,795
Right.

1161
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,497
One other thing.

1162
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:32,166
They're coming after me again.

1163
01:14:32,168 --> 01:14:34,001
Yeah, I know.

1164
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,806
- You hang in there, Pop.
- Okay.

1165
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,877
All right.

1166
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,465
Looking good.
Looking good.

1167
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:05,900
Where's Johnny at?

1168
01:15:05,902 --> 01:15:08,469
He told me
to saddle your horse.

1169
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,404
Just warming him up for you.
I hope you don't mind.

1170
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:12,840
- Why would I mind?
- Okay.

1171
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,810
Hadn't lost
too much there, son.

1172
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:18,379
Good. Yeah.

1173
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:21,015
Getting long
in the tooth here, so.

1174
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,819
Need all the help,
I can get.

1175
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:27,522
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you, darlin'.

1176
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:31,659
Whoa. Whoa. Yeah.

1177
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:35,096
Once I'm up here...

1178
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,431
I feel a lot better
than I do down on the ground,

1179
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,067
that's for damn sure.

1180
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:45,673
You know, you never answered
my question about what happened.

1181
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,176
<i>Of course I did.
You just don't listen.</i>

1182
01:15:49,178 --> 01:15:50,745
I have no idea.

1183
01:15:53,015 --> 01:15:54,615
So he just disappeared.

1184
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:56,717
Seems kind of impossible,
don't you think?

1185
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,688
I been over this
a thousand times.

1186
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,593
How many teen suicides
do you think there are

1187
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,795
yearly in America,
let alone Texas?

1188
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:10,598
- I don't know.
- Well, look it up
on your Google deal.

1189
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,567
Lake Brownwood
or any of these other lakes

1190
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:14,869
throughout the state?

1191
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:18,606
All right?
Just chalk another one up.

1192
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:21,776
That's all you have to say.

1193
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:24,712
Well, what else is there?

1194
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:27,481
You know...

1195
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:28,883
I missed you, Dad.

1196
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:35,523
Even if I don't understand you,
and I'd like to know you better.

1197
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:37,391
But I guess both
of our hearts are closed.

1198
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:40,094
Maybe that's the problem.

1199
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,762
Maybe.

1200
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,766
And I guess you'll never accept
that I'm gay.

1201
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:49,270
Benny, Ben boy, I... I...

1202
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:51,505
I mean...

1203
01:16:51,507 --> 01:16:56,344
why you do what you do,
whatever you do,

1204
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:58,546
but I'm working on it,
son.

1205
01:16:58,548 --> 01:17:00,781
You are?
Then why don't you listen to me?

1206
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,450
Why don't you put yourself
in my shoes?

1207
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,452
We'll switch roles
for a minute.

1208
01:17:04,454 --> 01:17:07,188
- <i> Why would I do that?</i>
- I tell you why.

1209
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,190
What do you think happens
between two men?

1210
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:11,292
What do you think we do
when we're in private?

1211
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:16,163
I'm not so sure I want to know.
It makes no sense to me, son.

1212
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:18,933
Well, I can explain it to you.
I can tell you.

1213
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:21,202
I can tell you
exactly what happens.

1214
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:22,803
Want to hear?

1215
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:25,039
I'm not talking about
slow dancing and honky-tonk.

1216
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,642
I'm talking about what happens
in the wee hours.

1217
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,210
<i>Want me to tell you?</i>

1218
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:32,580
I don't think so.
We could wait until another day.

1219
01:17:32,582 --> 01:17:34,215
- All right?
- All right.

1220
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:37,218
Well, you can think about
or you cannot think about it,

1221
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,653
but that's the situation.

1222
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,421
That's what's going on.

1223
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:42,790
15 years ago
is the same as today.

1224
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:44,992
So you can put another gun
to my head and say,

1225
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:47,294
<i>"Get the fuck
off the Briggs ranch,"</i>

1226
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:50,998
or you can be a real man
and accept what's going on.

1227
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,735
<i>You just think about it.</i>

1228
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,808
<i>Another thing...
Congratulations.</i>

1229
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:05,179
"Love" was a non-existent word
on this ranch.

1230
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,881
And I heard you use it
the other day

1231
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,883
when you were expressing
yourself to Maria.

1232
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:12,720
I'd never heard you utter
that word once,

1233
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:17,391
not even to mother years ago
before you run her off.

1234
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,326
<i>So congratulations.</i>

1235
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:23,864
Buried that word
a long time ago.

1236
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:34,675
I feel uncomfortable
up here, you know?

1237
01:18:34,677 --> 01:18:36,744
I feel uncomfortable.

1238
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:40,214
My mind goes round
and round and round and round.

1239
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,486
Grown men do strange things,
Maria.

1240
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:48,456
Grown men do strange things.

1241
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,626
There's only two things
in my life

1242
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:55,496
I wanted to tell you,
all right?

1243
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,031
I already told you one.

1244
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,668
And the other?

1245
01:19:00,670 --> 01:19:03,804
It'll have to wait...

1246
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:06,607
to another day.

1247
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:10,644
Let's go up top, okay?

1248
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:13,114
Did you bring picnic?
What'd you cook?

1249
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,816
- Yeah, it's right there.
- Oh, yeah where?

1250
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:18,319
The day you cook.

1251
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:23,891
I'm trying... trying to remember
when you were a little girl,

1252
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,459
we planted a tree.

1253
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,728
It was there over there...
I can't remember which...

1254
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,796
Which one.

1255
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:30,531
It was you...

1256
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:32,233
me and your mama planted it.

1257
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:33,634
I don't really remember.

1258
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:36,237
Oh, you...
You don't remember?

1259
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:40,241
Well, you were
too busy chasing boys.

1260
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,876
Liar.

1261
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:43,544
- What?
- Liar.

1262
01:19:43,546 --> 01:19:45,446
No liar.

1263
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:48,783
No, I'm not a liar.

1264
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:56,423
You always sing the same song,
but never finish it.

1265
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:58,125
I never finish it?
Well.

1266
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,828
Let's go on up here.
Let's see what's up here.

1267
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:02,596
You always...

1268
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:04,131
You always liked
this horse, didn't you?

1269
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:07,434
You always said it was
the best horse you ever sat on.

1270
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:08,769
That's for sure.

1271
01:20:08,771 --> 01:20:10,271
Well,
starting tomorrow morning,

1272
01:20:10,273 --> 01:20:12,907
he's no longer mine,
he belongs to you.

1273
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:14,875
You're gonna ride him
from here on in.

1274
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:17,411
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.

1275
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:22,616
He's my gift to you, Maria.
Just enjoy it.

1276
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:24,498
I won't be needing him
anymore.

1277
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,056
Wow.

1278
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:31,959
How many sunsets
has a person seen

1279
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:33,460
in a lifetime, I wonder.

1280
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:41,001
Quite a few, I imagine.

1281
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,538
No, the deal is,
how many are left?

1282
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,214
- Let's go on back.
- Let's go.

1283
01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:57,151
Watch out for the holes.
Watch out for the holes.

1284
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:25,045
I interviewed your son,
Ben,

1285
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:28,182
and I know that you and him
are lying about Jimmy Davis.

1286
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,955
I also know that you
and that Peter Rogers

1287
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:37,625
had an agreement concerning me
and possibly my son.

1288
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:43,264
You think you're above
the law, Mr. Briggs.

1289
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:47,034
People like you don't make
the world a better place.

1290
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:49,470
You think you do.

1291
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:51,605
I'm going to find out
what it is that you do

1292
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:53,207
when nobody's watching you.

1293
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,297
Ezekiel...

1294
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:18,565
Can't forget...

1295
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:20,634
I forget where it is.

1296
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:23,170
It's, uh...

1297
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:26,807
The Lord thy God loved thee...

1298
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:28,475
having ingrained thee

1299
01:22:28,477 --> 01:22:31,211
upon the palms of my hands.

1300
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,752
You don't like what I like?

1301
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,888
- No, I don't like it.
- Why not?

1302
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:43,757
You can change the damn thing.
Change it.

1303
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:46,226
What do you like?
What's, what's...

1304
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:48,696
- Oh, reggae, you like reggae?
- Not reggae.

1305
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,001
Why don't you sing something?

1306
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:56,036
- What?
- You sing something.

1307
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:58,505
All right. Turn it off.

1308
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:00,674
<i>I'll sing you a song
that I sing to Maria,</i>

1309
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:04,111
and I'll give you $50,000
if you can get the end of it.

1310
01:23:04,113 --> 01:23:05,873
- All right?
- All right.

1311
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:17,291
My uncle sang it.
That's all he knew.

1312
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:19,994
He was drunk all the time,
but, you know.

1313
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:22,629
I gotta guess the end?
You don't even know the end.

1314
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:24,331
No, I don't know the end.

1315
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,467
<i>So how you gonna know
if I have the right end?</i>

1316
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:29,803
Well... I'll know.
I'll know.

1317
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:32,206
Let me hear you,
let me hear your...

1318
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,775
Ramp it up, ramp it up.
I'll finish it.

1319
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:52,459
Getting horny for what?

1320
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:21,388
Okay.

1321
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:26,827
I'm very sorry...

1322
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:29,196
that I couldn't
understand you.

1323
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:31,031
I'm sorry that when
you were all grown up,

1324
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:35,002
I made it all about me
because like most men,

1325
01:24:35,004 --> 01:24:38,505
I wanted a perfect family,
but like most men,

1326
01:24:38,507 --> 01:24:41,975
I was not a perfect husband
or father.

1327
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:44,645
Yeah.

1328
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:47,815
And I'm sorry because I know
we cannot start over.

1329
01:24:47,817 --> 01:24:52,352
And that's what I'm most
sorry about. So.

1330
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:56,790
But I want you to know...

1331
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:03,630
I accept you as you are
because you're my son.

1332
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:09,403
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

1333
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:12,306
- I've missed you.
- <i> Yeah?</i>

1334
01:25:12,308 --> 01:25:14,875
And I accept you as you are
because you're my dad,

1335
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:17,077
and you're the only dad I got.

1336
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:19,847
Yeah.

1337
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,218
- All right?
- Yeah.

1338
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,853
You're a good boy.

1339
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,431
What are we doing here?

1340
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:40,134
Well...

1341
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,803
there's something
I gotta do, Benny.

1342
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:45,038
- Dad...
- No, no.

1343
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,807
I gotta make things right.

1344
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:50,277
Yeah. Trust me.

1345
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,548
Let's go.

1346
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:01,054
This won't take too long,
I hope.

1347
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:07,361
Hello? Anyone home?

1348
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,430
Hello? Anybody home?

1349
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,502
Hello? Hello?

1350
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:19,940
Who are you? What are you doing
in my house?

1351
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,808
Uh, I knocked.
I'm sorry.

1352
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,110
I didn't hear it.

1353
01:26:23,112 --> 01:26:25,712
Uh...

1354
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:28,649
I wanted to tell you
what happened to your son.

1355
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,154
- My son?
- <i> Yes. Yes, ma'am.</i>

1356
01:26:34,156 --> 01:26:35,856
Who are you?

1357
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:40,127
I know you.

1358
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:43,697
I'm Scott Briggs.
We met before.

1359
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,901
<i>This is my youngest son.
He knew your boy.</i>

1360
01:26:47,903 --> 01:26:51,405
They rode horses together.
Yeah.

1361
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:56,610
You are really Scott Briggs.

1362
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:59,413
Yes, ma'am, I am.

1363
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:03,450
And you have to hear
what I'm gonna tell you.

1364
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,870
It's difficult.

1365
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,751
A horse kicked your boy,

1366
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:41,755
kicked him and...
killed him instantly.

1367
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:45,425
A what?

1368
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,730
How do you know?

1369
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:51,932
I was there.

1370
01:27:56,304 --> 01:28:01,174
Easy son, easy. Move slow.
I know this horse. Easy.

1371
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:04,711
<i>Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you, son.</i>

1372
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,446
No one's gonna hurt you.

1373
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,327
Oh, Lord, what do I do?
Oh, Lord, what do I do?

1374
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:24,965
What have I done?
Oh, son, son.

1375
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,877
And I couldn't face anyone

1376
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:40,314
'cause everything I did
caused it, but I didn't do it.

1377
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,083
It was kinda like a...

1378
01:28:43,085 --> 01:28:45,852
a hit and run,
but I didn't do it.

1379
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:48,355
What happened?

1380
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:51,391
Where's my Jimmy?

1381
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:53,360
- <i> Your Jimmy?</i>
- Yes.

1382
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:59,299
Tell me!

1383
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:02,636
Oh! Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. I will.

1384
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,508
I got confused, went crazy.

1385
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,312
- Who are you?
Who the hell are you?
- Dad!

1386
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:13,680
Dad, let him go!
Let him go!

1387
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:17,351
My mind broke down
and went in...

1388
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:19,486
went in circles.

1389
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:21,588
I didn't know what to do.

1390
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:25,959
<i>So what I did was
the cowardly thing.</i>

1391
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:28,695
I... I buried him.

1392
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,931
I dug a big hole,
and I buried him.

1393
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:34,301
<i>And I had to come
tell you this today.</i>

1394
01:29:34,303 --> 01:29:35,736
<i>I had to.</i>

1395
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,679
I'm sorry.

1396
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,148
I'm sorry.

1397
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,525
What kind of man are you?

1398
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:05,799
Well, lady, grown men
do strange things sometimes.

1399
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:12,806
We had to make... a grave.

1400
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:20,547
The storm washed it away
four years ago.

1401
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:37,431
You ungodly thief.

1402
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:44,204
You... you had a grave with...
With our body.

1403
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:47,774
You left us without nothing.

1404
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,710
Without nothing!
Without nothing!

1405
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,650
<i>It was an accident.</i>

1406
01:30:56,652 --> 01:30:58,318
- No!
- <i> It was an accident.</i>

1407
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,620
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1408
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:03,723
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1409
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:16,203
<i>Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.</i>

1410
01:31:16,205 --> 01:31:18,238
Please go. Please go.

1411
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,207
Don't... don't touch me.

1412
01:31:20,209 --> 01:31:23,176
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

1413
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:24,744
Don't touch me!

1414
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:33,487
You walk hand in hand
with the Devil.

1415
01:31:33,489 --> 01:31:38,124
I had to come to you today
'cause my time's up.

1416
01:31:49,737 --> 01:31:51,037
Please go.

1417
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:55,242
- Hey, hey.
- No. No.

1418
01:31:55,244 --> 01:31:59,880
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

1419
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:03,250
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1420
01:32:03,252 --> 01:32:05,318
It's okay.

1421
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:08,321
What kind of a man you are.

1422
01:32:08,323 --> 01:32:10,257
What kind of a man
you are.

1423
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,861
It's okay.

1424
01:32:14,863 --> 01:32:16,696
My son.

1425
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,600
My son.

1426
01:32:28,009 --> 01:32:30,110
Thank you for coming, Ben boy.
I'm a coward.

1427
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:32,012
Thank you. Thank you.

1428
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:33,880
Dad...

1429
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:37,817
I never wanna see you again
for the rest of your life.

1430
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,791
Okay.

1431
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,863
Okay.

1432
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:06,145
I knew you might be coming along
this way today.

1433
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:12,852
How you know that?

1434
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:15,088
I just do.
That's how I am.

1435
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,562
I hear your son ropes
pretty good.

1436
01:33:22,564 --> 01:33:23,997
Yeah.
Texas state champion.

1437
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:25,932
Johnny says he knows
your husband.

1438
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:29,336
- Says he's a pretty good guy.
- You're blocking my door.

1439
01:33:29,338 --> 01:33:31,938
I'm sorry.
Hell of a Marine.

1440
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,375
- Yeah, Marine pilot.
- Mm.

1441
01:33:35,377 --> 01:33:38,044
My dad's a good guy, too.

1442
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:40,380
I hope you know that.

1443
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:46,386
I want you to stay away
from my father.

1444
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:48,788
I don't care if you're a...

1445
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:52,292
lady Ranger or whatever.

1446
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:53,727
He's the only father I've got,

1447
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:56,529
and I gotta make sure
I look out for him.

1448
01:33:56,531 --> 01:33:57,931
What can I do for you?

1449
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,334
Don't interrupt me.

1450
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:06,806
I want you to stay
away from my dad.

1451
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:09,509
He doesn't need this.

1452
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:13,346
That's the bottom line.
I hope you hear me.

1453
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:15,081
Anything else?

1454
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:20,487
No, ma'am, not right now.

1455
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:23,023
You're very brave
or very stupid.

1456
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:24,624
Excuse me.

1457
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:26,726
You have a good day.

1458
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:13,973
Oh...

1459
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:22,215
I think I'll take a little...
A little snooze here.

1460
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:24,818
Yeah. Yeah.

1461
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:31,891
I love you, Dad.

1462
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:34,561
I love you, too,
Ben boy, little Benny.

1463
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:38,198
I love you, too.
Yeah.

1464
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:43,002
If God won't forgive me...

1465
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:50,110
maybe you will someday...
I hope.

1466
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:54,481
Ooh..

1467
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:00,420
<i>You're a good boy.</i>

1468
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:56,002
There she is,
the girl of my dreams.

1469
01:37:56,004 --> 01:38:00,874
You've been saying
that since we were kids.

1470
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,442
When we were kids,

1471
01:38:02,444 --> 01:38:06,846
we would play cowboys
and Indians like the kids do.

1472
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:10,550
You know, only we would do it
with real horses.

1473
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:13,219
And guess who always...

1474
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,856
always got the role
of the Indian girl.

1475
01:38:16,858 --> 01:38:19,759
But now the Indian girl
wears a badge.

1476
01:38:19,761 --> 01:38:22,495
Yeah.

1477
01:38:22,497 --> 01:38:24,430
You wanna go for a ride?

1478
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:25,665
You bet.

1479
01:38:25,667 --> 01:38:27,767
Let's go.
