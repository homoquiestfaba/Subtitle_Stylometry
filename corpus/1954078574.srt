That is horrendous.

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,446
I also heard that people in those
days didn't wear underwear.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,567
That's a lie.

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,641
It's not a lie.

then what do you come home to?

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,248
Nothing except for
an empty bank account.

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,081
Why don't you save up
for a real life-changer?

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,043

Well, like...

67
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,726
That's fine. Maybe come back
another time without your friend.

that the fantasy

there is to be no touching

Anyone buying this?

no dishonor in surrender

An Austen heroine gets engaged
by the end of the book,

868

so that is what
I'm going to do.

869
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,089
Why don't you go
for Captain East?

870
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,886
Look how hot he is.

871
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,724

00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,129
Okay. East it is.

875
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,323
But can you help me, please?

876
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,687
I mean, this is not gonna work.

877
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,361
I've prepared my entire life
for this very moment.

878
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,560
Someone's coming, hurry up.

879
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,281
Heartwright had
millions of them.

880
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,923
She's as dumb as a light post.
She'll never notice.

Oh, my God.

882
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,010
Look at this one.

883
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,281
I love stealing
things from her.

884
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,763
Watch my mouth.

885
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,001

886
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,441

You can tell by the way he uses his
chalk that he's a ladies' man.

that kind of conversation.

He doesn't look over and yet
his expressions and mannerisms

don't you think?

a pleasant fellow.

Yes.

Oh.

Look at you, all moist.

use a handkerchief?

Captain.

00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:16,522
Perhaps I don't find the
conversation of women to be

932

why you're still single.

on your finger.

No, no, no, it's all right.

937
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,608
I asked for it.

938
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,444

because, apparently,

men are fictional.

941
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,122
And you think that there's
any good women out there?

942
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,770
No, no, no.

943
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,286

honesty and fidelity,

944
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,681

lecturing in Switzerland,

945

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,090
That's my trunk.

949
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,688
I have discovered an unmentionable
amongst your things.

950
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,649
Now I believe I
made it perfectly clear

951
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,484
about the rules,
Miss Erstwhile.

952
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,449
We thank you for your stay,
but I regret that

953
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,568
your actions have
forced me to cut it short.

954
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,047
What?

955
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,724
First, that horrid
little song and now this.

956
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,165
You're really
gonna kick me out?

957
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,971
I'm afraid it is
time for you to leave.

958
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,611
Go get 'em, Charming.

959
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,571
I'm so sorry, Jane.

960
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,121
If you would be so kind
as to step on to the cart.

961
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,891
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

962
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,450
Please, wait.

963
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,804
This is all my fault.

964
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,929
The modern contraption is mine.

965
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,044
I did not realize I had
it until I first arrived.

966
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,561
And I was so distressed,

967
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,247
Miss Erstwhile kindly offered
to keep it for me

968
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,243
where I would not have to
look upon the eyesore...

969
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,049
MRS. WATTLESBROOK:
Oh. Well,

970
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,360
I see.

971
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,444
So, apparently this appears
to be an accident,

972
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,529
and I think the best thing is we
should pretend like it never happened.

973
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,760
Lady Heartwright,
I do so hope that you will

974
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,241
continue to honor us
with your presence.

975
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,489
Yes. Of course.

976
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,206
Thank you.

977
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,770
I forbid you to leave,
ever, Miss Erstwhile.

978
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,325
We were just getting
to know each other.

979
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,250
Miss Erstwhile.

980
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,082
Yeah. Hi.

981
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,164
Thank you for back there
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

982
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,844
It was a pleasure to save you.

983
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,844
And, please,
you must call me Amelia.

984
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,286
Really?

985
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,331
Make haste.

986
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,640
Quickly.

987
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,005
Amelia?

988
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,921
Dear Jane, now that
we are bosom sisters,

989
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,486
I can at last
confide in someone.

990
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,486
Oh, Janey,

991
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,201
last year, at the ball,

992
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,040
Georgie...

993
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,971
George East and I

994
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,963
became engaged.

995
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,921
It is true.

996
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,490
But alas, he was a poor sailor,

997
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,047
and my father broke off the
engagement without my assent.

998
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,883
If I try to
explain this to him now,

999
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,649
George will think
I only want him back

1000
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,485
because he has
become a wealthy captain.

1001
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,327
What am I to do?

1002
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,291
I sort of thought you were
into Nobley, or is that not...

1003
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,130
No, no, no!

1004
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,367
Dear Jane, I know
you will help me

1005
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,011
find a way to be
alone with Captain East.

1006
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,402
I don't really
know what I could do.

1007
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,007
It pained me to be so dishonest

1008
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,082
with Mrs. Wattlesbrook
back there.

1009
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,368
But so long as you

1010
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,128
are my dearest friend,

1011
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,288
I'll keep your secret.

1012
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,566
Oh.

1013
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,649
Or should I say secrets?

1014
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,801
Farewell, bosom sister.

1015
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,608
You know, I think being creative
is a waste of time and money.

1016
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,284
AMELIA: Well, I love ribbons
and feathers and colors.

1017
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,731
Another blue tit,
please, Miss Charming.

1018
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,883
All right, but don't
copy everything I do.

1019
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,200
I'll try.

1020
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,810
ANDREWS: We're not worthy,
Mrs. Wattlesbrook.

1021
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,804
Their hearts will positively
burst from the rapture.

1022
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,323
I have something of the
utmost urgency to report.

1023
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,845
Who's game for
a bit of amusement?

1024
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,446
Me! Me! I'm so bored.

1025
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,205
Well, well, my cupcake,

1026
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,602
Mrs. Wattlesbrook has only
gone and surpassed herself

1027
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:40,321
and has completed
a brilliant theatrical.

1028
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,723
You don't look like
you could read or write.

1029
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,961
It's just a trifle.

1030
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,726
Now, there are six parts.

1031
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,610
Three sets of lovers.

1032
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,446
And I thought, give us something
to pass the time until the ball,

1033
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,648
we could rehearse
it and perform it

1034
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,441
for our illustrious
and distinguished authoress.

1035
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,090
Now are there any questions?

1036
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,289
No.
No what?

1037
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,488
You can't make me do a play.
It's humiliating.

1038
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,609
That's not a question. It's out
of the question, I'm afraid.

1039
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,603
I've got a question.

1040
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,569
Who gets to pick the lovers?

1041
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,130
Well, I'm thinking
maybe ladies' choice.

01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,684
Have fun tonight, Amelia.

1218
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,807
Oh.

1219
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,769
You look so beautiful.

1220
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,771
Piratey.
But like a beautiful pirate.

1221
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,723
It's infected.

1222
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,769
I'm so sorry.
CAPTAIN EAST: Maybe we should go.

1223
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,446
Ship's ahoy.

1224
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,891
Baby?

1225
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,445
It's okay, you look fine.

1226
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,760
MISS CHARMING:
It looks terrible.

1227
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,166
That does not look good.

1228
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,643
I was hoping to dance
with a goddess tonight.

1229
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,410
Lordy.

1230
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,165
Smother me in butter
and drop me in a saucepan.

1231
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,881
There she is.
My Venus de Milo.

1232
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,441
Colonel Andrews.

1233
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,567
Miss Charming.

1234
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,490
Tally-ho.

1235
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,928
I can't wait to
see your bedroom.

1236
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,367
Hi.

1237
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,521
Hey.

1238
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,168
Wow, you look...
You look amazing.

1239
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,923
Thank you.
You look very nice, too.

1240
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,324
Topshop.
(LAUGHS)

1241
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,682
Where are all
these people from?

1242
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,845
She's got everyone here, it's the
gardener, the maids, the servants.

1243
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,491
That guy over there,
that's the taxidermist.

1244
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,050
He's particularly creepy.

1245
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,000
How is the baby horse?

1246
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,321
He's good.

1247
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,289
Yeah.
He's talking and all that.

1248
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,289
Yeah. He was asking about you.
Really?

1249
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,408
Yeah. He said,
"Where's Straw Girl?"

1250
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,211
I made an impression, I'm sure.

1251
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,162
Jane, I'm really into you.

1252
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,971
And if you wanna get
out of here, I mean...

1253
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,610
Miss Erstwhile?

1254
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,805
Shall we?

1255
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,321
(MOUTHING)

1256
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,164
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

1257
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,088
Shall we?
Yes.

1258
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,641
You're stunning.

1259
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,761
Really?

1260
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,250
You all right?

1261
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,410
I'm fine. And you?
Are you having fun?

1262
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:57,731
I'm taking an inordinate amount
of pleasure from this evening.

1263
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,364
MISS CHARMING: You're so light on your
feet, you look like a nutcracker.

1264
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,322
But none of it from the ball.

1265
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,207
I think you just
complimented me.

1266
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,282
Jane, I need to
tell you something.

1267
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,289
I'm not meant to say
or do these things,

1268
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,767
my aunt would kill me, but...

1269
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,525
You are my sun and my moon.

1270
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,126
My earth and my stars.

1271
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,526
Marry me.

1272
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:24,127
Marry you? Oh, my God,
of course I will.

1273
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,481
Oh, God, I love you.
I love you.

1274
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,530
You make me the happiest
man alive, dear Amelia,

1275
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,126
if you'd be my wife.

1276
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,969
Oh, George.

1277
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,891
Jane.
Remember our first night?

1278
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,010
Something about bad first
impressions comes to mind.

1279
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,567
I know your opinion
of me was horrible.

1280
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,007
I was horrible.

1281
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,445
I was nervous.

1282
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,931
I felt out of place
and I certainly

1283
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,207
didn't intend on
falling in love, but...

1284
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,681
I have.

1285
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,726
I can't imagine leaving
this place without you.

1286
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,811
Please,
tell me if I have any hope.

1287
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,721
I didn't realize...

1288
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,371
This is how I'd
feel at this part.

1289
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,162
Feel what?

1290
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,000
You were right, this is a
dangerous kind of game.

1291
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,561
I don't wanna play anymore.

1292
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,804
What do you want?

1293
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,524
I want something real.

1294
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:38,646
Excuse me.

1295
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,170
Excuse me.

1296
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,725
Hey.

1297
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,126
Do you still
wanna get out of here?

1298
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,281
Yeah.

1299
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,200
Sorry.

1300
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,406
Good night, Your Majesty.

1301
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,083
I didn't think I was touching
you inappropriately.

1302
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,650
Well, you did.
And if we're to be together,

1303
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,166
you must never ever do
anything like that ever again,

1304
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,969
if we're to be together.

1305
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,525
Even Prudence is getting some.

1306
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,130
(LAUGHING)

1307
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,963
Are you ready?
Yes.

1308
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,326
So Wattlesbrook got Nobley
to propose to me tonight.

1309
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,561
Yeah. Classic.

1310
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,766
Yup.

1311
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,002
Is that when you
walked out? Just...

1312
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,487
Man, what a tart.

1313
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,800
Ah.

1314
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,645
I have to admit his character
was pretty dreamy.

1315
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,731
Yeah.

1316
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,085
I wouldn't marry him.

1317
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,441
Mainly because
he's got bad knees.

1318
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,887
Bad knees?
Did he mention his knees?

1319
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,369
I'm an even bigger nerd
than I thought, though.

1320
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,284
I mean, there were
actual moments

1321
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,681
when I really did
believe it was real.

1322
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,401
Don't feel bad. I mean, Wattlesbrook
hires the best actors around.

1323
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,010
Yeah.

1324
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,081
And...

1325
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,162
Some of her clients, you know,
aren't half bad either.

1326
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,131
(SIGHS)

1327
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,006
I'm so glad you're
outside of the fantasy.

1328
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,606
Makes it easier to
walk away from it all.

1329
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,524
You know my
flight leaves tomorrow,

1330
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,080
but I could see if
I could change it.

1331
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,288
Stay a few extra
days in London.

1332
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,970
That's an offer I...
I'm not gonna refuse.

1333
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,287
I fancy seeing you in...

1334
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,366
I don't know,
some trousers or...

1335
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,407
Do you wear anything
less 1800s, ever?

1336
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:46,720
Do you?

1337
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,485
Yeah, I do the short shorts.
(LAUGHS)

1338
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,691
<i>MRS. WATTLESBROOK: Please bring
soiled petticoats and undergarments...</i>

1339
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,569
Jane.
Lizzie.

1340
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,369
Are you off?

1341
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,488
I'm off.
I'm packing up.

1342
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,721
Hey, you know,
I wanted to say just...

1343
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,440
Thanks for everything.

1344
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,648
And I made this for you.

1345
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,364
All the sewing we did.

1346
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,442
That's beautiful.

1347
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,243
I think she's way prettier
than me, don't you think?

1348
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,971
(LAUGHS)

1349
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,081
That's really
great needlepoint.

1350
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,920
So what are you gonna do now?

1351
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,480
I thought I would stay on

1352
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:25,925
and check out all
the new recruits.

1353
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,411
You know, make sure that

1354
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,962
all of them know that
Colonel Andrews is taken.

1355
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:35,443
And then I thought I would
ask Miss Wattlesbrook

1356
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,000
if I can buy the place.

1357
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,286
You should.

1358
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,283
I know. I think I should.

1359
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,091
Lizzie, you know, I think...

1360
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,367
I think that Colonel Andrews...

1361
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,764
I think he...
That he might be...

1362
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,649
Perfect for you.

1363
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,964
Jane, thank you.

1364
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,203
I was so afraid you were gonna
say you thought he was gay.

1365
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:05,971
AMELIA: Adieu.

1366
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,485
Farewell.

1367
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,804
(LAUGHING)

1368
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,965
God, that was
the best time so far.

1369
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,969
Except for the eye gouging.

1370
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,491
You're not British?

1371
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,891
Yeah, I know, right?

1372
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,607
Well, that's what two years of
private drama tutoring will get you.

1373
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,084
You ended up
with Nobley, right?

1374
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,447
He was such a bore,
but, you know...

1375
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,642
He did a good job
of being into you.

1376
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,161
He asked me to pretend
your cell phone was mine.

1377
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,605
It's so sad when
the trip is over, but,

1378
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,411
frankly, lam dying
for a massage.

1379
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,851
My husband's old.

1380
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,526
Very old.

1381
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,762
And I trust you
discovered rewarding

1382
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,002
romance with one
of the gentlemen?

1383
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:01,203
Actually, there was someone,

1384
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,443
but not Mr. Nobley,
as you may have intended.

1385
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,728
My dear, Henry was
never meant for you.

1386
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,889
No, his job was to take care
of Lady Heartwright

1387
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,440
until George East
finished his little show.

1388
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,083
No, Martin was scripted for you
right from the very beginning.

1389
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,370
No, but he's...

1390
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,361
Martin's a servant.

1391
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,804
Well, you've seen my servants.

1392
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,280
I had to take him out just for a
little while because things were

1393
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,610
steaming up.

1394
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,288
But I had every confidence
that he could woo you back.

1395
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,408
And your timing
was very fortunate.

1396
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,926
Most of the ladies just
get a litter of kittens.

1397
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,010
The foal is the showstopper.

1398
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,210
The foal?

1399
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,170
I trust you would like
to be on your way, Jane?

1400
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,120
More than ever.

1401
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,480
Are you upset?

1402
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,645
No, not at all.

1403
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,769
And please don't take it
personally when I shut you down.

1404
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,921
Shut me down?

1405
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,970
I wasn't the first guest
Mr. Wattlesbrook assaulted, was I?

1406
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,884
I should be able to find
other complaints in no time.

1407
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,007

01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,840
Wow, Nobley, eh?

1411
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,129
Tied your cravat just a wee
bit too tight, didn't you?

1412
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,522
To be honest, I can't believe
you didn't get Jane.

1413
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,046
I mean, she was...
She was anyone's.

1414
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,329
Whoa! (LAUGHING)

1415
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,891
Mad dog over there.

1416
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,722
Colonel Andrews speaking.
Yes.

1417
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,806
Yes, no. I'll tell
him right away. Yes.

1418
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,761
Yes. Yes, you have a good day.
Of course. Bye-bye.

1419
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,847
Martin, that was the old girl
back at the house.

1420
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,604
Appears you're
still on the clock.

1421
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:10,969
You're to go to the airport and
smooth some ruffled feathers pronto.

1422
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,528
No rest for the gorgeous.

1423
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,809
Hi. No luggage. No.

1424
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,161
<i>WOMAN: (ON PA) This is
a passenger announcement.</i>

1425
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:34,564
<i>Can Jane Erstwhile please
report to the information desk?</i>

1426
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,689
<i>That's Jane Erstwhile

1427
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,085
Hi, I think they...

01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,446
Jane. Hey.

1429
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,729
I'm really sorry
you didn't know, okay?

1430
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,971
I'd still like to spend
the night together. Yeah?

1431
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,962
You are an actor!

1432
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,210
Hey. Hey, but...

1433
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,965
But you're desperately
in love with me anyway?

1434
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,089
And these sudden passionate feelings
that sent you running after me

1435
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:11,004
have nothing to do with
Mrs. Wattlesbrook's fear

1436
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,570
that I'm gonna report
her delinquent husband?

1437
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,608
Of course not. Okay?
Right.

1438
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:16,205
I know it all seems shady,
but romances

1439
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,402
have bloomed on stonier ground.

1440
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,202
Did Wattlesbrook write that line?
Because we know you didn't.

1441
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,484
Okay, she wrote the line. Okay?
Right.

1442
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,324
But I'm the one
standing here saying it.

1443
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,561
Jane!

1444
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,407
Jolly good, the prefect's
here to save the day.

1445
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,926
You can't believe
anything he's said.

1446
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,401
I've only just realized now that
Martin was assigned to you.

1447
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,289
I know. I... Yeah.

1448
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,691
She knows, so...

1449
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,564
So, what are you doing here?

1450
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,008
It's just that
I don't think you understand

1451
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,128
that I'm not
what you think I am.

1452
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,168
I have fallen for you.
Right.

1453
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,124
My aunt was an actor, sure.

1454
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,682
She's an odd woman, I know,
but she was desperate.

1455
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,285
What I'm saying is
that your first week

1456
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,890
at the manor was
my first week, too.

1457
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:58,650
I'm not an actor.

1458
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,449
Don't listen to him, Janey.

1459
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,603
Don't call me Janey!
You were paid to kiss me.

1460
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,604
As far as you are concerned,
lam Miss Erstwhile.

1461
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,728
I mean, it's so embarrassing.

1462
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,643
What, do you keep
a supply of pregnant horses

1463
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,529
just laying
around or something?

1464
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,648
What?
You're not a vet!

1465
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,290
I did a biology
class at school.

1466
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,600
Come on, you were acting, too.

1467
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,250
Look, before you go
and make your report,

1468
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,764
you should know, gorgeous,

1469
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,128
that what we had was real.

1470
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,364
No, you didn't. What we
had was real. Didn't we?

1471
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,131
Surely you felt it seeping through
all these costumes and pretense?

1472
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,929
He's still acting.
It's all part of his act.

1473
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,804
See the costume?
He's an actor.

1474
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,530
You're just jealous,
aren't you?

1475
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,125
Because my aunt
would rather bring in

1476
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,441
a complete novice
than move some

1478
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,331
You're not British either?

1479
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,481
It's part of the Commonwealth.

1480
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,681
Couldn't you get
a job on <i>The Hobbit?</i>

1481
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,571
That's it, Shakespeare.

1482
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,881
No!

You guys.

1484
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,648
Just... Don't actually,
actually strangle him.

1485
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,165
Okay. All right, all right.

1486
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:00,605

1487
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,125
Careful of my shirt!

That's my foot!

1489
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,048
Okay, okay.
No, no, no. I'm...

1490
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,485
Stop! No.

1491
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,605
No! It is over.
I am done with all of this!

1492
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,324
That felt good. I should have
done that a long time ago.

1493
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,771
Yeah.

1494
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,810
Excuse me.

1495
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,044
Did you hear that, England?

1496
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,487

01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,451
I could have.

You're right.

1530
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,609
What was I thinking?

1531
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,802
Wait a minute. Hey.

1532
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,727
You know, I'm not
gonna report your aunt.

1533
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,249
So it was a little overkill
to send you all the way here.

1534
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:48,007
She didn't send me.

you actually are.

My name is Henry.

It's Henry Nobley.

1538
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,601
I'm a history professor.
Oh.

1539
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,241
That's really nice.

1540
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:07,245
I used to think my aunt's
profession was somewhat grotesque,

1541
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:09,721
but the truth is that I enjoyed
stepping into history.

1542
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,002
The idea of
a simpler world where

1543
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,445
love is straightforward
and lasting.

1544
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,443
I believe we have
that in common.

1545
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,248
But all of this is
secondary to the fact

1546
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,608
that I am completely
mad about you.

1547
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,965
All right.
Well you

1548
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:30,010
may have been mad
about Miss Erstwhile, but...

1549
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:32,128
You don't even know me. I...

1550
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,563
You are Miss Erstwhile.

1551
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,761
I saw you in the theatrical.
You were horrifying.

1552
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,287
Wait a minute. You were
horrifying. I was...

1553
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:42,887
I wasn't great.

1554
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,121
My point exactly.

1555
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,680
Neither one of us are
capable of pretending.

1556
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,610
Nobley, I just
don't think this is a...

1557
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,763
The night of the ball, you said
you wanted something real.

1558
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,803
I'd like to
believe that I am real.

1559
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,530
Is it possible that

1560
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,443
someone like me
