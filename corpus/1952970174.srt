GEORGE: <i>Since the dawn</i>
<i>of recorded history,</i>

2
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:47,236
<i>something like 110 billion human beings</i>
<i>have been born into this world.</i>

3
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,780
<i>And not a single one of them made it.</i>

4
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,749
<i>There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.</i>

5
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,288
<i>Roughly 60 million of them die</i>
<i>every year. 60 million people.</i>

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,850
<i>That comes out to about 160,000 per day.</i>

7
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,622
<i>I read this quote once when I was a kid,</i>

8
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>"We live alone, we die alone.</i>
<i>Everything else is just an illusion. "</i>

9
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,505
<i>It used to keep me up at night.</i>

10
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,137
<i>We all die alone.</i>

11
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,303
<i>So, why am I supposed to spend my life</i>
<i>working, sweating, struggling?</i>

12
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,636
<i>For an illusion?</i>

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,607
<i>Because no amount of friends,</i>

14
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,641
<i>no girl,</i>

15
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,650
<i>no assignments</i>
<i>about conjugating the pluperfect</i>

16
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,589
<i>or determining the square root</i>
<i>of the hypotenuse</i>

17
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,592
<i>is gonna help me avoid my fate.</i>

18
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,224

<i>Filtered water and pictures of you</i>

22
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,325
<i>And I'm not coming out until this is all over</i>

23
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,762
<i>And I'm looking through the glass</i>

24
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,233
<i>Where the light bends at the cracks</i>

25
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,645
<i>And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs</i>

26
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:32,116

30
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,993
Do you have your work, George?

31
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,230
- No.
- Why not?

32
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,201
- I was depressed.

33
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,536
Oh, yes? Why was that?

34
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,210
Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.

35
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,679
We're all gonna die one day, George.

36
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
I don't think that's a reasonable excuse

37
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,683
for not completing
your trigonometry exercise.

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,448
Well, I was trying to.

39
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,591
I just couldn't shake
this awareness of my mortality.

40
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,390
Everything seemed meaningless,

41
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,253
- including the assignment, unfortunately.

I want you to go to the principal's office

43
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,598
and find meaning in the homework.

44
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,137
Bring it to me completed
by the end of the period.

45
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,959
- You're late.
- I was so engrossed in my work.

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,731
- I haven't done anything.
- You've always done something.

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,169
You better go.

49
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,836
Bill.

Even though you have
off-campus privileges as a senior,

00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,978
if you are seen
anywhere in the city smoking,

52
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,142
you have your privileges revoked.
Automatic probation.

53
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,847
Why are you telling me?

54
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,523
- You think I can't smell?
- You can smell all you want.

55
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,259
Shall we get down to business?

56
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,717
Yes, we shall.

In a way, your future depends
on the next few months.

58
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,957
Not just for college.

59
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,004
I mean, it sets the tone
for everything that follows.

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,239
Now, I know how you think and I know

61
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,901
you're thinking it's too late
and you're gonna be a fatalist

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,409
and let it all go to hell.

63
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,876
But, George, if you keep performing
the way you are,

64
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,917
forget about college,
forget about graduating, even.

65
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,409
So,

66
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,119
this counts as your official warning.
Suspension is next.

67
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,523
I thought probation was next.

68
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,989
Don't play the angles, George.
They won't work.

69
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,225
Neither do jokes.

70
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,323
I wasn't joking.

71
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,627
I know you're capable.

72
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,032
I have a real problem with motivating.

73
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,206
But I think I can do it.

74
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,871
I'll try.

75
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,074
All right, go.

76
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,411
And don't make me regret it.

DOUGHERTY:
Who's smoking up here?

78
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,481
George! What do you think you're doing?

79
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,194
Sorry. I...

80
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,395
I was having a tough day.

81
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,557
I guess the stress finally got to me,
Mrs. Dougherty.

82
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,896
George, why do you do these things?

83
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,632
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

84
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,434
Now, what do you mean by stress?

85
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,985
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,697
- I got an e-mail from your school.
- Oh, Jesus.

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,532
Some kind of academic probation?

88
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,465
Can I help you?

89
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:24,134
Can I get you a tutor
or a private college advisor?

90
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,607
If you don't get into a decent school,

91
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,581
then I don't know
how you're gonna get a job.

92
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,208
I have it under control.

93
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,950
Honey, if you don't get into
a decent college...

94
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:41,515
- I'm gonna go watch TV.
- No, you will not watch TV.

95
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,855
You will stay here

96
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,159
till we can come up with a plan
for getting you into college.

97
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,994
I had a hard day at school, I'm tired,

98
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,728
and I'm gonna go relax now
for half an hour.

99
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,073
Then I will do my work. Okay?

HARRIS: George?

101
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,810
The fuck are you doing?

102
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,146
I'm drawing.

103
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,953
Are you sketching your subject,
you little shit?

104
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,627
Yes.

105
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,631
- I don't have a subject, Harris.
- Why the heck not?

106
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,739
I don't know.

107
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,468
George, you're going to have to start
digging around in there,

108
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,601
so you can develop that talent of yours,

109
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,010
so you can start to use that brain of yours

110
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

111
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,982
So, figure out what you want to say,
and say it.

112
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,145
- Harris.
- Yes.

113
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,087
I don't have anything to say.

114
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,162
(SHOUTING) Find something!

115
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,875
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,740
- I'm Sally.
- I know.

117
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,315
Thanks for covering for me.

118
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,509
No problem.

119
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,779
Why did you?

120
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,512
I don't know.

121
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,157
You were doing something so renegade,

122
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,691
I thought you deserved to get away with it.

123
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,623
I run afoul of the authorities so often,

124
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,289
I figured I could handle it better than you.

125
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,496
You're really weird.

126
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,607
SALLY: So, why don't you ever
do your work?

127
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,766
There are so many more important things
to think about,

128
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
homework ends up seeming like
an afterthought.

129
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,507
ADD?

130
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,446
No, they tried everything.

131
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,314
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

132
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,218
Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker.

133
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,216
No, it's more like,
we're living in a dying time, you know?

134
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,094
I mean, you got global warming, wars,
terrorism, tsunamis.

135
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,258
- Okay...
- We're definitely on the downhill side.

136
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,299
So, what are we working towards?
What's the point?

137
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,037
I thought I had fears,
but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

138
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,041
- Pain, death.
- Not me.

139
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,006
I fear life.

140
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,101
(LAUGHS)

141
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,973
Do you have any friends, George?

142
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,944
I'm kind of a misanthrope.

143
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,719
Not a choice, just a fact.

144
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,764
Okay, handsome.

You wanna come up?

148
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,423
I'm sorry about that, chicken.
We had a really late night.

149
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,551
I think we got home right before
you left for school.

00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,192
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

151
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,665
- Well, George.
- Hello, Mrs. Howe.

152
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,396
- What a genuine pleasure.
- Very nice to...

153
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,596
Sally, do you know
where our stemware went?

154
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,832
I'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

CHARLOTTE: And this was before
we left the sticks.

157
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,971
So, I cock one eye, look down,

or a water moccasin, or...

00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,316
Water something. Something I had to kill.

00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,621
But it was the pilot's hand!

162
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,695
Oh!

163
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,996

You know,
ticklish people make great lovers.

My God. She's amazing.

Not if you're her daughter.

How'd you end up in New York?

171
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,019
My mom had me when she was 16.
My dad was a truck driver,

172
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,387
and one day he took off
and never came back.

173
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,959
And this was?

174
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,654
Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee.

175
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,996

219

is how the town's layout is described

from the perspective of a bee traveling
from one side of town to the other.

372

process of death and rebirth.

what I think I should paint,

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,068
You hardly have the right
to comment on mine.

523
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,800
- I've seen the way he looks at you.
- Jesus.

524
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,669
This all means something
much more to him.

525
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,445
Trust me, I've played with
their affections my whole life.

526
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:22,045
But with the good ones, it's not right.

527
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:26,823
That's what you do. It's not what I'm doing.

528
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,733
DUSTIN: This is a great idea, by the way.

529
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,036
I got a show coming up
in a couple of months.

530
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,163
I needed some inspiration, you know?

531
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,332
Big time.

532
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,505
GEORGE: Do you like this?

533
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,977
DUSTIN: I get it. Do you?

534
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,776
I think anyone could turn this out,
except why would they want to?

535
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,283
What's it saying?

536
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,910
Makes a room look great, though,
you know?

537
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,154
It looks like money.

538
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,728
Oh, God.

539
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,360
This is heaven to me.

540
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,269
Pretty great.

541
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,764
This makes you feel something
instantly, you know what I mean?

542
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,137
Like anger

543
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,143
or wrath.

544
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,145
Lust.

545
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,721
So, how's it going with
our friend Sally? Make any moves?

546
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,227
She hasn't shown any interest.

547
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,691
Well, have you?

548
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:44,098
What do you think, she's gonna go
around wearing a sign around her neck?

549
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,532
Women love being desired.

550
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,299
You just go throw her up against
the wall, start kissing her.

551
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,499
Chances are she'll kiss you back.

552
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,169
And if she doesn't, then at least you tried.

553
00:41:56,947 --> 00:42:00,542
You gotta do something
or you might lose her.

554
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,527
You love this.

555
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,169
No, it's good.

556
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:27,004
Fetishizing an object. That suits you.

557
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:45,087
I can't believe we're participating
in this consumer circle jerk.

558
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,322
The dateless need to
stick together tonight.

559
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,695
We're like survivors huddling for warmth.

560
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,700
You've probably had so many Valentines.

561
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,268
Is that some kind of euphemism for slut?

562
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:58,909
(SALLY LAUGHS)

563
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,977
The one I remember most was my dad.

564
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:03,837
Where was that?

565
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,643
It was before we left Tennessee.

566
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,210
I was six and he had already left,
but he'd come back every so often.

567
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,821
He roared up on his motorcycle,
took me out alone.

568
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,417
We had pancakes with chocolate syrup
at a diner, at night.

569
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,496
He let me order.

570
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,900
Where's your father?

571
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,603
Beijing. He moved there years ago
for the economic boom.

572
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,575
You guys have a relationship?

573
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,079
He checks in, pays my tuition.

574
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:41,808
But we couldn't be more different.
I think he's a little disappointed.

575
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:49,090
I spent some time in Tokyo with him
when I was seven.

576
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,693
He was running a company there,
working 12, 14 hours a day.

577
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,561
So, I had this full-time Japanese
babysitter who didn't speak English.

578
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,895
We couldn't understand each other at all.

579
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,795
Pretty soon,
she ran out of things to do with me

580
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,873
and I ended up
never leaving the hotel room.

581
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,135
I was like a veal.

582
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,472
What were you like as a child?

583
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,179
I was such a better person than I am now.

584
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,179
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

585
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,759
I was happy, I was open, I was curious.

586
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,890
But I'll tell you this,
I knew when it was ending.

587
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,330
I was overwhelmed with sadness
when I realized that I was gonna change

588
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,597
and that it was all
most likely gonna get worse.

589
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,307
Like a nostalgia for the present,
I couldn't shake it.

590
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
What?

591
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:46,381
I'm weird, right?

592
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,351
No.

593
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,519
No, you're not.

594
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,390
It's weird not having a boyfriend.

595
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,092
It's been so long.

596
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:09,027
That's because it's the first year at school
nobody's older than you.

597
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:10,640
Your pool dried up.

598

- How do you know that?
- I'm a very insightful person.

599
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,610

600
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,881
Yeah, tons.

601
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,820
No, really. Have you?

602
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,817

603
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,992

Will you have sex with me?

610

I'm just kidding.

611

I called this meeting because
your teachers have reported to me

700
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:19,958
that you continue to refuse
to do the course work.

701
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,726
You have made zero effort to turn
your career here at Morgan around.

702
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,467
Yes, I did.

703
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:29,800
I mean, I did struggle with it
at the beginning, but I just couldn't.

704
00:53:29,894 --> 00:53:32,328
Well, you are out of time.

705
00:53:32,997 --> 00:53:35,431
The moment to decide your future
has arrived.

706
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:41,631
Now, against the recommendation
of some in this room,

707
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,602
I'm giving you a choice.

708
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:46,102
First is expulsion.

709
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,373
It's yours if you want it.

710
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:49,977
Second option,

711
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:55,181
if you want to graduate, you make up
every single assignment you missed.

712
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,980
Every paper, every exercise.

713
00:53:57,087 --> 00:54:00,318
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

714
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:05,327
If even one is missing
on graduation day, no diploma.

715
00:54:07,865 --> 00:54:09,833
You have a little over three weeks.

716
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:15,204
George, I used to believe you had
more potential than anyone else here.

717
00:54:15,306 --> 00:54:17,240
But you never delivered, not once.

718
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:19,532
I wasn't gonna waste the time
getting mad at you.

719
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,735
I'm not gonna waste the time
defending you now.

720
00:54:28,185 --> 00:54:30,949
Forget the lack of respect
you show, George.

721
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:36,816
This is the way we make our living,
how we spend our lives.

722
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:40,028
But you simply don't care
what goes on around here.

723
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:42,824
Why would we continue to reward that?

724
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:46,468
You're right.

725
00:54:47,604 --> 00:54:48,969
You shouldn't reward it.

726
00:54:52,176 --> 00:54:54,474
I honestly don't know what to say.

727
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:57,844
Maybe it should be expulsion.

729
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,750
Let us know on Monday.

730
00:55:03,187 --> 00:55:04,984
All right. All right.

731
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:07,879
Thank you.

732
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,396
Did you tell my parents about this?

733
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:20,930
Yes, George, I had to.

734
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,484
Hey.

735
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,018
I don't know what to say.

736
00:55:37,855 --> 00:55:40,915
Is it my fault?
I mean, I've had a lot on my mind and...

737
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,390
It's not your fault.

738
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:46,496
I don't think I can do it.

739
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:49,532
Well, what do you mean?
What other choice is there?

740
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:52,568
- Mom, I'm not sure that I can.
- You're just gonna have to do it.

741
00:55:52,669 --> 00:55:55,160
You're just gonna have to sit down
and just do it!

742
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:56,739
Mom, I'm trying to speak to you honestly.

743
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:59,741
I don't care! I'm done listening to your lies!

744
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:01,208
Come on, that's really the way to fix this!

745
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:04,712
Hey, George!
This is your mess, and it's a disaster.

746
00:56:05,082 --> 00:56:06,515
You're right, Jack. It is my mess.

747
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:08,778
I'll handle my mess, you handle yours.

748
00:56:09,386 --> 00:56:11,013
- Okay, watch that tone.
- Wait, Viv.

749
00:56:12,556 --> 00:56:13,784
What does that mean?

750
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,393
I mean, you wanna tell us
where you've been spending your days

751
00:56:16,493 --> 00:56:17,926
for a couple of months this past winter?

752
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:20,930

Do you?

757
00:56:29,773 --> 00:56:31,900
Do you know that Jack was wandering
the streets for weeks,

758
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:33,476
pretending to go to work?

759
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,269
Did you get that sorted out, Jack?

760
00:56:35,379 --> 00:56:38,576
Or are you still working out of a coffee
shop booth like a homeless person?

761
00:56:38,816 --> 00:56:39,805

I swear. I promise, I...

778
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,846
I thought you were gonna leave it alone.

779
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:25,987
I'm not gonna say sorry.

As opposed to some douche bag
she just met

782

and wouldn't even let you look at her?

You want me to thank you?

784
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,497
I actually felt something.

785
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:48,737
That doesn't always happen.
It hasn't happened in a very long time.

786
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:53,883
And I've lived long enough to know
that when it does, you should act on it.

787
00:58:57,321 --> 00:58:58,948
I didn't think you were ready.

788
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,491
I thought you were so cool.

789
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,391
I never meet anyone cool.

790
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:55,576
Hi.

791
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,239
Hi.

792
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,414

Can't have been fun for you.

794
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:08,351
He broke his collarbone.
We were in the ER all night.

795
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:12,823
I'm so sorry.
That should have never happened.

01:00:19,136 --> 01:00:20,501

799
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:22,629
Mom, I'm obnoxious,
I'm deeply disrespectful.

800
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,502
We're getting a divorce.

801
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:37,682
Come on, I'm sure he'll never do it again.

802
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,457
Now that he knows I can hospitalize him.

01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:47,022
We were already headed there.

804
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:50,361
His business went bankrupt
about a year ago,

805
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:54,233
and I thought I should have faith in him
and support him.

806
01:00:54,438 --> 01:00:58,306
But there was always some sort of excuse,

807
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:01,409
or his luck was about to turn.

808
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:04,639
So, he convinced me
to mortgage the apartment,

809
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,545
and then my own business.

810
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,943
But it was never enough.

811
01:01:09,986 --> 01:01:13,717
He's a sick man, and I should have told you,

812
01:01:14,257 --> 01:01:17,556
but you were under enough pressure
and I didn't wanna distract you.

813
01:01:17,794 --> 01:01:19,318
I like distractions.

814
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,489
It gets worse.

815
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:29,338

that dull, lifeless assignments

She's already down there.

Getting engaged means
her alimony payment stops,

which means she can't pay
my tuition for Boulder next year,

913
