1
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,922
<i>Ana, take my car.</i>

2
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,938
I gave you the recorder right?

3
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,499
- Oh, yes.
- And you have all the questions?

4
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,090
- Yes.
- And you know where you're going?

5
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:46,724
Yes, I do have a GPS, and a four point GPA.

6
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,393
- I can figure it out.
- You're wearing that?

7
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:55,804
Okay, a little less talking, more eating.

8
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,774
Miss Kavanagh?

9
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,102
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, yes

10
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,205
Ella... Ella... Okay.

11
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:55,050
- Mr Grey will see you now.
- Okay.

12
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,837
- This way please.
- Okay.

13
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,219
<i>Mr Grey is in a conference at 11:15.</i>

14
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:10,011
Right this way.

15
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:22,249
Miss Kavanagh, are you alright?

16
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:28,773
- Christian Grey.
- I'm Anastasia Steele.

17
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:33,518
Miss Kavanagh has the flu,
so she asked me to fill in.

18
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:36,477
I see, so you're studying
journalism as well?

19
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:41,590
No. English literature
Kate's my roommate.

20
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,824
As I said, I only have 10 minutes.

21
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,669
Please, have a seat Miss Steele.

22
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:13,447
Thanks.

23
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,849
- Ready?
- Whenever you are.

24
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,230
Okay.

25
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,903
So this is for the special graduation issue

26
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,252
of the student newspaper.

27
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:28,677
Yes I'm giving the commencement address

28
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,198
at this year's ceremony.

29
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,424
You are?

30
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:37,158
I mean um… I know.

31
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:43,840
You are very young to
have amassed an empire.

32
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:46,194
- To what do you owe-
- To what do I owe my success?

33
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:50,047
- Yep.
- Seriously?

34
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:51,412
Yes.

35
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:58,693
Business is about people, and
I've always been good at people.

36
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:03,141
What motivates them, what inspires them.

37
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,021
Well maybe you're just lucky

38
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,053
I've always seen, the more hard eye
work, the more luck I seem to have.

39
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,347
The key to my success is
identifying talents in individuals.

40
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:21,609
- And harnessing their efforts.
- You're a control freak?

41
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,333
Oh I exercise control in
all things Miss Steele.

42
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:33,370
Okay um, your company is involved primarily

43
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,330
in the telecommunications sector.

44
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:39,427
Yet you also invest in numerous
agricultural projects.

45
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:43,569
Including several in Africa. Is that
something you feel passionate about?

46
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:45,420
Feeding the world's poor?

47
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,001
Its smart business.

48
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,599
You don't agree?

49
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,340
I don't know enough about it.

50
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:05,586
I just wonder, if you're heart might be
a bit bigger than you want to let on?

51
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,871
But some people say I don't have a heart.

52
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,004
- Why would they say that?
- Because they know me well.

53
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:16,834
Continue.

54
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,728
Do you have any interests outside of work?

55
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,424
I enjoy various physical pursuits.

56
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:29,857
You're unmarried, oh
you were adopted at age four.

57
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:31,444
That's a matter of public record.

58
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,689
I'm sorry I didn't...

59
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:38,223
Do you have an actual
question, Miss Steele?

60
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,268
Yes.

61
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:43,365
Are you gay?

62
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,312
Its written here, I'm just...

63
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,898
No, Anastasia. I'm not gay.

64
00:07:57,068 --> 00:08:00,089
I apologise, Mr Grey
Kate can be a little-

65
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:04,466
- Intrusive?
- Curious.

66
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,334
What about you?

67
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:17,165
Why don't you ask me
something you wanna know?

68
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,260
Earlier you said that there are some
people who know you well.

69
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,010
Why do I have the feeling
that that is not true?

70
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,564
Mr Grey, your next meeting
is in the conference room.

71
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,527
Cancel it please, we're not finished here.

72
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,748
Yes sir.

73
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:42,684
No I um… I can go.

74
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,733
- Its fine.
- I would like to know more about you.

75
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:50,016
There's not really much to know about me.

76
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:55,738
You said you're in English literature? Tell
me was it Charlotte Brontë, Jane Austen

77
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,574
or Thomas Hardy, who made you fall in love
with literature?

78
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,407
Hardy.

79
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:06,711
I would've guessed Jane Austen.

80
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:11,394
What are your plans for after you graduate?

81
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,591
I'm just trying to get through my finals.

82
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,454
- And then?
- Then I was planning on moving here

83
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,658
to Seattle with Kate.

84
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,085
We offer an excellent internship program

85
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:26,961
I don't think I'd fit in here.

86
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:36,494
- Look at me.
- I am.

87
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:42,359
<i>Mr Grey's office</i>

88
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:43,995
I hope you got everything you needed

89
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:47,178
I think you only answered four questions.

90
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,430
- Anastasia.
- Christian.

91
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,050
Holy cow.

92
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:29,498
- Before you say anything-
- You're a goddess, this is perfect.

93
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,312
What?

94
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,936
I just got his email, he
answered every question.

95
00:10:34,197 --> 00:10:36,265
So? What was he like?

96
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:45,366
- He was fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

97
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:54,599
He was very polite, and courteous,
very formal and clean.

98
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:00,886
Clean?

99
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:06,403
I mean, he was you know, smart.

100
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:11,156
And intense, kind of intimidating.

101
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:15,726
- I can understand the fascination.
- Uh huh!

102
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:20,639
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

103
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:22,025
Okay.

104
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,923
I'm gonna make a sandwich, you want one?

105
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:26,957
No, thanks.

106
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:35,149
You have to admit, he's ridiculously hot.

107
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:43,338
I'm sure if you're attracted
to that sort of human.

108
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,850
The hot type of human?

109
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:51,229
I asked him if he was gay.
It was in your questions.

110
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,383
Why would you do that to me?

111
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:54,896
Because whenever he's in the society pages.

112
00:11:55,085 --> 00:11:57,289
He's never been photographed with a woman
So naturally.

113
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,958
Well maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private Kate.

114
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,541
- And now you're defending him.
- I'm ending this conversation.

115
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,831
Too bad we don't have any
original photos of your

116
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,371
hot, clean, 27 year old billionaire.

117
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,923
The camera loves him as much as you do.

118
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,193
Okay I wasn't hungry, but now I am.

119
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:22,091
Thank you.

120
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:07,258
- Ana, I've been looking for you.
- Whats up?

121
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,577
- Guess what?
- What?

122
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:12,506
Portland's place is going to exhibit
my photographs next month.

123
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:13,695
Oh my god!

124
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:17,322
Congratulations, that's so good!

125
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:19,849
- It feels so good.
- Can we celebrate later?

126
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,684
- Cause I'm really late for work.
- Yeah, yeah, you got it, you got it.

127
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:27,797
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Thank you, you're my hero.

128
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,928
- See you later.
- Okay.

129
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:40,009
Mom I'm at work can I call you back?

130
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,873
<i>No wait I called for a reason.</i>

131
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:45,241
<i>Bob broke his foot playing
golf of all things.</i>

132
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:47,399
Christ is he okay? In a lot of pain?

133
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:50,019
Who knows? The man called the paramedics
because of a blister.

134
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,999
<i>It means though, we won't
be able to fly in for graduation.</i>

135
00:13:55,549 --> 00:14:00,821
Really? You could just come alone,
you don't have to bring Bob.

136
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,368
Least I could do to fend for himself.

137
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:07,606
- You understand don't you darling?
- Yeah, yeah its fine.

138
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:11,804
- I really have to go, okay?
- I love you Ana.

139
00:14:11,993 --> 00:14:13,419
I know I love you too.

140
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:15,698
God.

141
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:21,226
- Ana - can you give me a hand out back?
- Uh yeah yeah, I'll be right there.

142
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:33,846
- Thought it was you.
- What the fuck?

143
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,229
What a pleasant surprise Miss Steele.

144
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:41,600
It's Ana, just Ana. You're in here...

145
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:45,449
I was in the area on business,
needed to pick up a few things.

146
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:51,165
- Are you free?
- Yeah… What can I help you with?

147
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,197
Do you stock cable ties?

148
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,886
Cable ties, yes we do, I can
show you if you want.

149
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:01,873
- Please, lead the way Miss Steele.
- Its Ana.

150
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,873
- That it?
- Masking tape.

151
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:13,217
- Are you redecorating?
- No.

152
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:20,031
We have one inch and two
inch, but the truly self

153
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:22,695
respecting handyman would
have both in his tool box.

154
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,322
Of course he will.

155
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:26,831
It's rare to find a
connoisseur these days...

156
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:33,577
- Did you want anything else?
- Yes, rope.

157
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:40,340
That's very impressive.
Do you girl scouts?

158
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:47,417
No, organized activity groups aren't
really my thing.

159
00:15:48,301 --> 00:15:53,675
- So what is your thing?
- I don't know… Books?

160
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:03,048
Okay, rope, tape, cable ties
You're like a complete serial killer.

161
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:06,760
- Not today.
- Anything else?

162
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:11,137
- What would you recommend?
- For a do-it-yourself er?

163
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:15,204
Maybe coveralls, to
protect all your clothes?

164
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:22,002
- Or I could just take all my clothes off.
- Okay, no clothes

165
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:27,791
I mean, no coveralls
I can't think of anything else.

166
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,275
- I guess that must be it.
- Cool.

167
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:36,549
Thank you for answering
Kate's questions by the way.

168
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,725
- She was thrilled.
- I hope she's feeling better.

169
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,783
Yeah she is, she's just having trouble
finding an original photo of you.

170
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,033
If she'd like an original,
I'm around tomorrow.

171
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:48,476
- You'd be willing to do that?
- Yeah.

172
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:52,505
- Do you want me to bag for you Ana?
- No, I'm good, thanks though Paul.

173
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,789
Okay.

174
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,481
I'm staying at the Heathman.
Call me before 10.

175
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:11,180
- About the photos.
- Oh, yeah, I will.

176
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,288
Enjoy your...

177
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:37,286
Thanks for doing this again Mr Grey.

178
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:41,463
- I'm happy to help.
- How about we try a few with a smile?

179
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:47,813
Or not.

180
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,779
You do realise he hasn't
stopped looking at you?

181
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:55,239
He asked me to go for coffee afterwards.

182
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:56,428
What?

183
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:58,538
Kate shh…

184
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,671
Is he your boyfriend?

185
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,768
- Who?
- The photographer.

186
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:10,540
- Jose? No.
- I've seen the way he was smiling at you.

187
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:15,154
No Jose is more like family. He's
not my boyfriend.

188
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:20,537
- And the guy at the store?
- Paul? No.

189
00:18:28,722 --> 00:18:29,972
Thank you.

190
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:42,699
- You seem nervous.
- I find you intimidating.

191
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,328
You should.

192
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,901
- Eat.
- Not to mention high-handed.

193
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,383
I'm used to getting my own way.

194
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:55,725
Then you must get very boring.

195
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:03,788
- Tell me about your family.
- My family? Okay.

196
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,645
My dad died when I was a baby.

197
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:09,316
So I was raised by my step-father Ray.

198
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:13,308
- He's amazing.
- And your mom?

199
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:22,124
My mother is on husband number four.
She's an incurable romantic.

200
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,569
- And you?
- Am I romantic?

201
00:19:27,037 --> 00:19:31,155
Well I study English Literature.
I kind of have to be.

202
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,960
But the photo shoot went well right?
Kate seems to be really happy.

203
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:41,270
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- What?

204
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,703
I'll walk you out.

205
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:52,016
- Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?
- I don't do the girlfriend thing.

206
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:54,205
- What does that even mean?
- Watch it!

207
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:11,372
I'm not the man for you.
You should steer clear of me.

208
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:15,958
I have to let you go.

209
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,648
Goodbye Mr Grey.

210
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,681
Alright pencils down.

211
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,535
Please take your final exams to the
back of the classroom.

212
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,805
Final grades will be posted
in two weeks.

213
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:39,570
- Hey, you all good?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

214
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:43,100
- We are so partying tonight.
- Oh my god.

215
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,068
This is way too much.

216
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:47,932
No, we're getting exactly the
right amount.

217
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:50,239
- All over my face?
- That's the idea.

218
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:55,060
- Wow, no Kate.
- Cab's early, lets go.

219
00:20:57,492 --> 00:20:59,424
Ana, there's a package for you.

220
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:05,742
<i>"Why didn't you tell me there was danger?
Why didn't you warn me?</i>

221
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,168
<i>"Ladies know what to guard against</i>

222
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:10,917
<i>"... because they read novels
that tells them of these tricks ".</i>

223
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:13,145
That's a quote from Tess
of the d'Urberville.

224
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,443
Oh my god.

225
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:17,241
These must be from Christian.

226
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:21,464
I mean…

227
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:24,521
These are incredible.

228
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,316
Wow, Grey.

229
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:33,423
Kate these are first editions
I can't, this is too much.

230
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:36,520
I can't accept them, I
have to send them back.

231
00:21:37,522 --> 00:21:40,266
That's the cab, okay, are you ready?

232
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:43,463
- Are you really though?
- Yes, yes, very.

233
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:44,660
Lets get outta here.

234
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,246
Shots! Shots! Shots!

235
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,218
No holding back here girl.

236
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:55,658
- Did you do it all?
- Alright!

237
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,931
With my right eye closed and left handed,
I can get this in.

238
00:21:58,966 --> 00:21:59,966
- What?
- I gotta pee.

239
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,432
- Okay.
- One, two...

240
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,616
- Where you going?
- I gotta go pee.

241
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:44,805
- Anastasia.
- Yep, this is me.

242
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:49,686
Sending back your expensive books, cause
I already have hard copies of that,

243
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,342
Thanks though, for the kind gesture.

244
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:55,136
You're welcome. Where are you?

245
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,811
Oh… I'm in line, cause I have
to pee really bad.

246
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:05,070
- Anastasia have you been drinking?
- Yeah, I have… Mr Fancy Pants.

247
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,620
You hit the nail on the head.

248
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,751
<i>I mean the head right on the nail.</i>

249
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:12,788
Listen to me, I want you to
go home right now.

250
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:13,906
<i>You're so bossy.</i>

251
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,452
"Ana, lets go for coffee"
"Ana, lets go for coffee."

252
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:23,064
"No stay away from me Ana, I don't
want you. Get away."

253
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:25,349
"Come here, come here."
"Go away."

254
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:26,169
That's it.

255
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:29,500
- Tell me where you are.
- I'm a long way from Seattle.

256
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:32,533
- Long way from you.
- Which bar, whats it called?

257
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:35,048
- I don't know, I gotta go.
- Which bar Ana?

258
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:40,756
I told him right?

259
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,522
I'm sorry I didn't mean...

260
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:51,891
Stay where you are,
I'm coming to get you.

261
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:56,033
What? Hello?

262
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:13,801
- Hey.
- Oh thanks.

263
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:15,518
Are you okay?

264
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:21,636
Yes, I just feel a little
more drunk than...

265
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:27,025
- Come here stay warm.
- Oh that's cool, I'm good Jose.

266
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:31,646
No, I wanna have the courage
to do this.

267
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:32,732
Do what?

268
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:35,707
- Ana, I like you.
- You do?

269
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:37,291
- Very much.
- Oh my god.

270
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:41,216
- No, no, no.
- Please, one kiss.

271
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,621
No, no, no José, I'm sorry, no.

272
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:49,119
- Dude, she said no.
- Christian?

273
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:55,595
- Don't look at me.
- Here.

274
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:04,699
Nice touch, I will launder this item.

275
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:07,110
- Lets get you home.
- I'm with kate.

276
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:10,414
- I'll have Elliot tell her.
- Who's Elliot?

277
00:25:10,438 --> 00:25:12,719
He's my brother, he's inside
talking to her right now.

278
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,859
- I, I don't...
- He's at my hotel with me.

279
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:21,840
- You're still at the Heathman?
- Yes. Come.

280
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,825
- That's your brother?
- Not by choice, lets go.

281
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:42,600
Wait what did Kate say?

282
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:45,365
She warned me to be on my best behaviour.

283
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,155
- More like threatened me.
- She threatened you?

284
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:56,081
You're spinning.
I think I'm gonna faint.

285
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:57,114
What now?

286
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:32,024
<i>Eat me, drink me.</i>

287
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,231
Good morning Anastasia.

288
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:59,561
- How you feeling?
- Better than I deserve.

289
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:07,059
Did you put me to bed?

290
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:14,929
- You undressed me?
- I didn't have much choice.

291
00:27:16,306 --> 00:27:17,565
Where did you sleep?

292
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:26,752
- Dear god… We didn't...
- Necrophillia's not my thing.

293
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:31,761
- So we just slept then?
- It was a novelty for me too.

294
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:40,570
You - need to eat.
I had Taylor pick you up some clothes.

295
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,457
- Who's Taylor?
- My driver.

296
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,769
- Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.
- Yes I did.

297
00:27:48,093 --> 00:27:49,725
Yours were covered in vomit.

298
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:53,952
You shouldn't have drunk like that.

299
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:55,828
I'm all for testing the limits but

300
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,312
- ...you put yourself at risk last night.
- I know.

301
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:06,424
If you were mine you wouldn't
be able to sit down for a week.

302
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:08,462
What?

303
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:13,442
I gotta go take a shower.

304
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:23,238
Why am I here Christian?

305
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,921
You're here because I'm incapable
of leaving you alone.

306
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,289
Then don't.

307
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:43,927
- Why'd you send me those books?
- I thought I owed you an apology.

308
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,807
- For what?
- For letting you believe that I...

309
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:59,044
Listen to me. I don't do romance.

310
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:09,113
My tastes are very - singular.
You wouldn't understand.

311
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,036
Enlighten me then.

312
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:01,230
- You look beautiful.
- Taylor has good taste.

313
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:09,244
- What are you doing here later?
- I'm working at the hardware store till 7.

314
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:11,615
I'll have Taylor pick you up then.

315
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,568
I'd like to bite that lip.

316
00:30:20,687 --> 00:30:22,426
I think I'd like that.

317
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:27,193
I'm not gonna touch you, not
until I have your written consent.

318
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:29,416
What?

319
00:30:29,843 --> 00:30:32,510
I'll explain later.
Come I'll take you home.

320
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:47,583
Fuck the paperwork.

321
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:13,243
What is it about elevators?

322
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,551
Hey.

323
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:30,774
- Hi, you must be Ana.
- You must be Elliot.

324
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,452
And we must be going, Elliot.

325
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:36,393
So awesome your place.
Kate's told me a lot about you.

326
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,482
Elliot grab your shoes, some of us
have work to return to.

327
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:42,718
What you're doing with Mr. Worm here,
I've got no idea.

328
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:47,154
Laters baby.

329
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:53,228
I'll see you tonight, email
me if something changes.

330
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:54,804
My computer's broken.

331
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,427
Well call then, you know
you have my number.

332
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,600
Laters baby.

333
00:32:06,602 --> 00:32:10,442
- Elliot seems really nice.
- No, no. We're starting with you.

334
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:13,790
If you're seeing him again tonight,
this means that something happened.

335
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,016
- Ana? Tell me what happened...
- I have to get ready for work.

336
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:24,192
We just kissed. Once.

337
00:32:24,816 --> 00:32:27,665
Only once? That's odd.

338
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,360
- Odd doesn't even cover it.
- Uh huh, and a new jacket.

339
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:51,158
Bye.

340
00:32:52,565 --> 00:32:54,993
Hi, its Taylor right?

341
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:58,406
Good evening Miss Steele, Mr
Grey will be joining us there.

342
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,261
Good evening, Anastasia.

343
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:32,988
What, you're flying this?

344
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:51,974
No escaping now.

345
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:00,983
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie Tango.
Ready to depart.

346
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,665
<i>Charlie tango, your flight plan to
Seattle has been cleared..</i>

347
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:06,335
Seattle? That's where we're going?

348
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:11,983
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes please.

349
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:42,143
- You play?
- Yes.

350
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:46,571
Of course you do.

351
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:58,293
- Whats this?
- Its a nondisclosure agreement.

352
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:03,553
It means you cannot discuss anything
about us with anyone.

353
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:06,862
I'm afraid my lawyer insists on it.

354
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:09,501
I would never talk to anyone
about us anyway.

355
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:23,488
Are you gonna make love to me now?

356
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,930
Two things: First, I don't make love

357
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:37,006
I fuck - hard.

358
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:45,915
- And the second?
- Come.

359
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:02,731
- Its just around this door.
- What is it?

360
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:06,806
- My playroom.
- Like your xbox and stuff?

361
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,769
Its important you know that you
can leave at any time.

362
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,162
Why, whats in there?

363
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:15,670
I meant what I said, the helicopter

364
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:17,637
is not standby, for whenever you
wanna go.

365
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:19,450
Just open the door.

366
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,739
Oh my god.

367
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,036
Its called a flogger.

368
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,448
Say something please.

369
00:38:38,802 --> 00:38:40,519
Do women do this to you or...

370
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:43,232
I do this to women. With women.

371
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:44,942
Women who want me to.

372
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:59,266
- You're a sadist?
- I'm a dominant.

373
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,646
What does that mean?

374
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:03,525
It means I want you to willingly
surrender yourself to me.

375
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:06,166
Why would I do that?

376
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:12,011
- To please me.
- Please you? How?

377
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:16,192
I have rules, if you follow them,
I'll reward you.

378
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:18,942
If you don't, I'll punish you.

379
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:22,563
You'd punish me, you'd
use this stuff on me?

380
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:27,957
- Yes.
- What would I get out of this?

381
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,170
Me.

382
00:39:46,057 --> 00:39:50,543
If we were to do this,
this would be your room.

383
00:39:50,967 --> 00:39:52,692
You can decorate it however you like.

384
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,072
You want me to move in?

385
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:00,191
Not full time, just
Friday through to Sunday.

386
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:07,467
- We can negotiate the particulars.
- So - I'd sleep in here with you?

387
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:12,453
No I sleep downstairs. I told you
I don't sleep with anyone.

388
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:17,464
What if I don't want anything to
do with that?

389
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,337
Then I understand completely.

390
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,658
But then we wouldn't have
any sort of relationship at all?

391
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:25,350
This is the only sort of
relationship I have.

392
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:32,565
- Why?
- Its the way I am.

393
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,853
When you said negotiate, what did you mean?

394
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:48,576
I already have the contract prepared.
Fairly detailed.

395
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:54,637
You would review, and negotiate what
you are and not willing to try.

396
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,118
How can I know what I'd
be willing to try?

397
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:02,043
Well when you had sex, was there
anything you didn't like doing?

398
00:41:04,997 --> 00:41:07,407
We have to be honest with each other
for this to work,

399
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,431
Okay?

400
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:17,789
- I… I wouldn't know.
- What do you mean?

401
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:25,823
- Because I haven't...
- You're still a virgin?

402
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:29,949
- I've just shown you-
- I know, I know.

403
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:34,204
- You've done other things right?
- No.

404
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:47,232
- Where have you been?
- Waiting.

405
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,635
Guys must throw themselves at you.

406
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,886
They're never what I've wanted.

407
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:02,237
Your biting your lip.

408
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:17,748
- What are you doing?
- Rectifying the situation.

409
00:42:17,872 --> 00:42:19,290
I'm a situation?

410
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,883
You're energetic this morning.

411
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:21,576
- You hungry?
- Very.

412
00:47:25,613 --> 00:47:27,313
Because I'm making pancakes.

413
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:36,740
Lets get you cleaned up.

414
00:48:26,866 --> 00:48:28,371
Do you trust me?

415
00:48:40,436 --> 00:48:41,701
Stay here.

416
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,779
Hold out your wrists.

417
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:19,895
Hold them there. Understand?

418
00:49:21,704 --> 00:49:26,629
- Tell me you understand.
- I won't move my arms.

419
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:28,751
Good girl.

420
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,181
- Stay still.
- Okay.

421
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:53,959
- Say yes.
- To what.

422
00:49:53,983 --> 00:49:55,586
Being mine.

423
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,922
<i>Christian!</i>

424
00:50:01,946 --> 00:50:04,397
- Shit.
- Its my mother.

425
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,201
- I'm naked.
- Get dressed.

426
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:17,019
No need to show me around, no
need to hover.

427
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:20,541
- He's sleeping Dr. Grey.
- Still sleeping? He never sleeps in.

428
00:50:20,576 --> 00:50:21,998
Certainly not at this hour.

429
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,642
Unless of course he's ill is he? Ah.

430
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:27,119
- Sorry Mr. Grey.
- Its fine I know how she can be.

431
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:31,878
She? Darling you can try to avoid me, but
the least you can do is.

432
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:34,183
Call me by my correct name, which is mama.

433
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:37,734
- Hi.
- Oh, dear god.

434
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,445
Mother, Anastasia Steele.
Ana, meet my mother.

435
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:42,036
Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.

436
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,571
You have no idea how
delighted I am to meet you.

437
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:47,773
Its nice to meet you too Dr. Grey.

438
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:50,304
Grace. She's very pretty.

439
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,582
You are very pretty.

440
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:52,606
Thanks.

441
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,802
What happened to calling before
dropping by?

442
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:59,273
And have your head-henchman give
me the run around here, no thank you.

443
00:50:59,297 --> 00:51:03,245
I'll take my chances. Well I was in the
neighbourhood and I thought perhaps

444
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,607
we could have lunch.

445
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:06,897
I can't today, I have to drive Ana home.

446
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:11,537
Its okay, take it.
I was just showing mother out.

447
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:12,572
Excuse me.

448
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:15,234
Anastasia!

449
00:51:15,258 --> 00:51:16,884
- Kate, wait.
- It was a joy to meet you.

450
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,248
I'm having the whole family
for dinner at my house.

451
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,885
Christian's sister Mia is back
from Paris, so lets come.

452
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:25,331
We'll see mother.

453
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:27,546
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

454
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:30,686
Kate.

455
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:32,987
Thank you.

456
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:40,278
I can't talk about it right now Kate.

457
00:51:45,459 --> 00:51:47,626
I gotta go, I'll call you back okay?

458
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:07,856
Everything okay with the phone call?

459
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:13,638
Yeah, nothing important.
I liked your mom.

460
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:17,927
She's excited. She's never seen
me with a woman before.

461
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:20,144
You're the first.

462
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:27,267
What is it Ana?

463
00:52:29,161 --> 00:52:33,277
I just… How many women have stayed in here?

464
00:52:35,191 --> 00:52:36,449
15.

465
00:52:38,695 --> 00:52:42,761
- That's a lot of women.
- I told you before, if you want out-

466
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,213
I don't want out, I'm just not jumping
at the opportunity

467
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:48,949
for whips, torture and your red room
of pain.

468
00:52:48,973 --> 00:52:52,274
The red room is much more about pleasure.
I promise you.

469
00:52:56,566 --> 00:52:59,826
Will we still go out to
dinner, and movies...

470
00:53:00,999 --> 00:53:02,662
That's not really my thing.

471
00:53:05,004 --> 00:53:06,569
Try to keep an open mind.

472
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:14,268
If you agree to be my submissive,
I will be devoted to you.

473
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:20,166
This is what I want.
And I want it with you.

474
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:30,383
Why do I have to sleep in here?
We slept in the same bed last night.

475
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,149
Like normal people.

476
00:53:32,573 --> 00:53:35,601
Try not to get hung up on the
sleeping arrangements.

477
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:39,257
If you agree to do this,
you're gonna want your own room.

478
00:53:39,581 --> 00:53:41,748
Why, because I'll be your sex slave?

479
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:45,362
I don't wanna do this here,
lets talk downstairs.

480
00:53:45,386 --> 00:53:49,384
No. I think I'll hold on to my
freewill a little while longer thank you.

481
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,127
Actually you know what, I would like
to go home, can I go home?

482
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:03,348
- Which one's yours?
- All of them.

483
00:54:53,643 --> 00:54:55,272
Lets go for a walk.

484
00:54:58,025 --> 00:55:03,083
- How did you start doing this?
- One of my mother's friends.

485
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:08,330
- I was 15.
- She seduced you?

486
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:15,780
- I was her submissive for six years.
- Seriously, does your mother know that?

487
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:20,342
Of course not. No one in my family
knows about this.

488
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:22,555
Part of me.

489
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:29,837
So she introduced you to all of this?
Mrs Robinson?

490
00:55:30,642 --> 00:55:34,905
Mrs Robinson? I'll tell her you said that.
She'll love it.

491
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:41,595
- You still talk to her?
- On occasions. We're friends.

492
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:54,598
Ana. I know how intimidating this is.
I felt the same at first.

493
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:59,233
Well… What made you change your mind?

494
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:08,335
By giving up control, I felt free,
from responsibilities.

495
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:12,388
From making decisions.
I felt safe.

496
00:56:13,363 --> 00:56:15,207
You will too, you'll see.

497
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:20,950
I never took anyone in the helicopter.

498
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:27,229
Never had sex in my own bed.
Never slept with anyone.

499
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:31,514
Ever. Only you.

500
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,749
This is the contract.
Read it carefully.

501
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:01,193
Email me if you have any questions.

502
00:57:01,639 --> 00:57:03,603
I told you, my computer's down.

503
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:05,051
Just consider it okay?

504
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:12,605
I really hope you say yes.

505
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,357
- Thanks for the ride.
- Laters baby.

506
00:57:31,669 --> 00:57:33,880
- Um.
- Okay, you're all set.

507
00:57:34,004 --> 00:57:34,995
Your roommate let me in.

508
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,462
I just figured you
forgot to tell me about it.

509
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,469
- Do I look okay?
- Tell you about what?

510
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:42,174
- Just sign here.
- Hold on, do you have the right apartment?

511
00:57:42,198 --> 00:57:43,856
Anastasia Steele?

512
00:57:50,932 --> 00:57:53,391
- Enjoy.
- Another gift huh?

513
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:55,935
What happened to flowers and chocolate?

514
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:57,887
I'm dying to hear everything, but

515
00:57:57,922 --> 00:58:00,069
I have to run right now, cause Elliot
and I are having dinner.

516
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:01,606
And then we're seeing a show at the Gorge.

517
00:58:01,665 --> 00:58:04,653
Jose called for you, twice, by the way.

518
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:09,119
- Is that some article?
- No... These are.

519
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:11,463
These are my thesis notes, I
left them at school.

520
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:13,694
Oh okay, well there's yesterday's mail.

521
00:58:23,058 --> 00:58:27,870
- What?
- I don't know. You look - different.

522
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:32,068
- I feel different.
- Of course you do.

523
00:58:34,008 --> 00:58:36,465
- Okay.
- Bye.

524
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,654
Bye.

525
00:59:24,558 --> 00:59:27,240
<i>The following are the terms of
a binding contract. .</i>

526
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:32,765
<i>Between the dominant and the submissive.
The fundamental purpose of this contract.</i>

527
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:36,954
<i>Is to allow the submissive to explore her
sensuality, and her limits of safeness.</i>

528
00:59:38,227 --> 00:59:41,976
<i>The dominant and the submissive agree and
acknowledge that all that occurs</i>

529
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,601
<i>under the terms of this contract will
be consensual, confidential.</i>

530
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:49,190
<i>And subject to the agreed limits
and safety procedures.</i>

531
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:54,687
<i>Set out in this contract.
The submissive will agree to any...</i>

532
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:57,779
<i>sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable
by the dominant,</i>

533
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:00,740
<i>Excepting those activities,
outlined in HARD LIMITS.</i>

534
01:00:03,637 --> 01:00:07,597
<i>The submissive agrees to procure
oral contraception from a physician</i>

535
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:12,315
<i>of the dominant's choosing.
The submissive will not enter into</i>

536
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:15,412
<i>sexual relations with anyone other
than the dominant.</i>

537
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:21,254
<i>The submissive will eat regularly,
to maintain her health and well-being</i>

538
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:22,852
<i>from a prescribed list of foods.</i>

539
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:27,345
<i>The submissive will not drink to excess</i>

540
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,507
<i>smoke or take recreational drugs.</i>

541
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:35,623
<i>The submissive will conduct herself
in a respectful manner.</i>

542
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:39,534
<i>To the dominant, and so only address him
as Sir, Mr Grey.</i>

543
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:41,567
<i>Or such other title, the
dominant may direct.</i>

544
01:00:43,403 --> 01:00:47,071
<i>The submissive may not touch the dominant,
without his expressed permission to do so.</i>

545
01:00:49,376 --> 01:00:51,014
<i>The safe word yellow</i>

546
01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:53,110
<i>will be used to bring the attention
of the dominant</i>

547
01:00:53,134 --> 01:00:55,534
<i>that the submissive is close to her limit.</i>

548
01:00:55,558 --> 01:00:57,331
<i>When the safe word RED is spoken.</i>

549
01:00:57,366 --> 01:00:59,348
<i>The dominantes actions will cease
completely</i>

550
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:01,132
<i>and immediately.</i>

551
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,910
<i>Submissive.</i>

552
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:08,981
<i>Does the submissive agree to be
restrained, with hands bound?</i>

553
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:11,797
<i>Does the submissive consent
to being blindfolded?</i>

554
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:14,694
<i>Does the submissive consent to be gagged?</i>

555
01:01:14,718 --> 01:01:18,294
<i>How much pain is the submissive
willing to experience?</i>

556
01:01:56,344 --> 01:01:57,647
Christian.

557
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,116
Its been nice knowing me has it?

558
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:17,953
Let me remind you, how nice it was.

559
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:27,404
Is this what you want?

560
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,693
Don't make a sound.

561
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:54,808
That was really nice.

562
01:05:03,126 --> 01:05:04,712
What are you doing to me?

563
01:05:23,175 --> 01:05:24,629
What about here?

564
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:30,876
Why not? Is that breaking the rules?

565
01:05:34,729 --> 01:05:38,819
- Speaking of which...
- I haven't made up my mind yet.

566
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,543
You're not staying?

567
01:05:49,004 --> 01:05:53,179
I told you.
I don't sleep with anyone.

568
01:05:54,332 --> 01:05:55,931
Can we negotiate?

569
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:19,975
That's a hell of a sack Miss Steele.

570
01:07:29,509 --> 01:07:30,799
Business meeting.

571
01:07:56,867 --> 01:07:59,951
- Impressive.
- I've done this before.

572
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:06,093
- Business meetings I mean.
- Oh.

573
01:08:06,717 --> 01:08:09,568
Miss Steele. Your meeting.

574
01:08:11,649 --> 01:08:15,819
Page 1 - strike out my old address
and replace it with the new one.

575
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:18,269
An oversight. Do go on.

576
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:21,330
Page 3, section 15-20.

577
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:25,552
"The submissive shall submit to
any sexual activity"

578
01:08:25,576 --> 01:08:30,244
"... demanded by the dominant without
hesitation or argument."

579
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:41,567
Turn to page 5, appendix 3, soft limits.

580
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:45,389
- With you.
- Find anal fisting.

581
01:08:45,713 --> 01:08:48,350
- I'm all ears.
- Strike it out.

582
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,522
Strike out vaginal fisting too.

583
01:08:55,946 --> 01:08:58,181
- You sure?
- Yep.

584
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:01,428
Same page.

585
01:09:01,452 --> 01:09:04,164
"Is the use of sex toys acceptable
to the submissive."

586
01:09:04,188 --> 01:09:07,038
Vibrators - okay Dildos - fine.

587
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:11,117
Genital clamps - absolutely not.

588
01:09:11,441 --> 01:09:17,446
- Consider them gone.
- What are butt plugs?

589
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:35,995
You must go through quite a few
non-disclosure agreements.

590
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,301
My staff know only what I
choose to tell them.

591
01:09:40,032 --> 01:09:41,985
Please resume Miss Steele.

592
01:09:45,164 --> 01:09:48,928
Also, on page 5, there are some terms
which need clarification.

593
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:53,876
- Suspension.
- Hanging on a rope from the ceiling.

594
01:09:54,907 --> 01:09:58,075
- For what possible reason?
- For your pleasure.

595
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:03,414
- Really?
- And mine - something to consider.

596
01:10:03,438 --> 01:10:04,962
No. Hard limit.

597
01:10:07,081 --> 01:10:11,737
"Is bondage acceptable to the submissive?"
I'm good with rope.

598
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:16,412
Leather casts, hand cuffs...
Please lose tape.

599
01:10:18,139 --> 01:10:23,714
- And whats others?
- Cable ties?

600
01:10:26,877 --> 01:10:30,633
Can I just say how impressed I am
with your commitment to this meeting?

601
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:36,113
And in that spirit, I'm gonna offer
something sweeter.

602
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:42,427
How about, once a week, on a night
of your choosing, we go on a date.

603
01:10:43,613 --> 01:10:50,518
Just like a regular couple - dinner
movie, ice skating.

604
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:55,635
- Whatever you want.
- Accepted.

605
01:10:56,435 --> 01:11:01,030
- You're very kind.
- I'll suggest it in Appendix 5.

606
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:19,190
I would like to fuck you into
the middle of next week.

607
01:11:22,169 --> 01:11:26,023
- You're not fighting fair.
- I never have.

608
01:11:27,703 --> 01:11:32,419
I'll review all these changes and
try to arrive at a decision.

609
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:35,534
- You wanna leave?
- Yes.

610
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:41,056
But your body tells me something different.
Your legs for instance.

611
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:45,110
The way you're pressing your thighs
together under the table.

612
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:52,257
The change in your breathing.
And then your complexion.

613
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:55,291
- My complexion?
- You're flushed.

614
01:11:56,276 --> 01:11:59,239
- That could just be the wine.
- Its the adrenaline.

615
01:12:08,437 --> 01:12:13,628
Say I did stay. What would happen?

616
01:12:14,452 --> 01:12:19,214
First, I would help you out of
that little dress of yours.

617
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:22,988
- Yes?
- Then I'd be pleased to discover

618
01:12:23,012 --> 01:12:26,018
- ...that you are naked underneath.
- Really?

619
01:12:28,507 --> 01:12:32,095
- Then I would bend you over.
- Right here?

620
01:12:32,867 --> 01:12:36,302
- Yes.
- On this table?

621
01:12:37,761 --> 01:12:38,761
Yes.

622
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:59,802
Thank you for the meeting Mr. Grey.

623
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:12,128
This is me.

624
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,967
Didn't know I was a collector
of classic cars huh?

625
01:13:19,544 --> 01:13:22,248
You're sure I can't persuade
you to stay?

626
01:13:22,283 --> 01:13:23,819
Goodnight, Christian.

627
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:27,874
- When will you know?
- Soon, maybe.

628
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:39,584
Why do I think you're telling me goodbye?

629
01:13:41,009 --> 01:13:42,075
Because I'm leaving.

630
01:13:49,345 --> 01:13:51,378
You got your speech ready yet?

631
01:13:51,413 --> 01:13:52,413
More or less.

632
01:13:52,665 --> 01:13:54,437
- Annie.
- Dad!

633
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:57,555
Hi.

634
01:13:57,647 --> 01:14:00,158
Sorry I'm late, I had a hell
of a time parking.

635
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:02,331
Oh that's okay, you're here,
that's all that matters.

636
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,810
You're kidding me, I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

637
01:14:03,834 --> 01:14:06,098
I saved you a seat next
to Kate's parents okay?

638
01:14:06,122 --> 01:14:07,615
- I'll sit where you want Miss Steele.
- Okay. I'll see you after.

639
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,361
Yeah, good luck out there.

640
01:14:09,585 --> 01:14:12,642
And is also a major benefactor
for our university.

641
01:14:13,146 --> 01:14:16,717
Please join me in welcoming,
Mr Christian Grey.

642
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:37,135
Thank you. I am deeply moved by the great
compliment accorded to me today.

643
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:42,169
- He is so hot.
- Oh god. He so is.

644
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:46,641
I heard he's gay.

645
01:14:46,676 --> 01:14:49,317
<i>Sustainable methods of farming
for third world countries.</i>

646
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:55,448
The goal? To eradicate hunger and poverty
across the globe.

647
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:04,278
I myself have known what its
like to be profoundly hungry.

648
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:06,964
So this is a very personal mission for me.

649
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:18,509
Anastasia Steele.

650
01:15:20,493 --> 01:15:21,493
Thanks.

651
01:15:25,286 --> 01:15:27,693
Congratulations, you must be very proud.

652
01:15:27,717 --> 01:15:32,319
- I am. Nice tie by the way?
- Truthfully its become my favourite.

653
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,045
- Do you have your answer yet?
- I'm still thinking.

654
01:15:36,069 --> 01:15:38,967
Anastasia, just try it my way. Please.

655
01:15:39,895 --> 01:15:41,818
- Okay.
- What?

656
01:15:45,929 --> 01:15:47,421
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

657
01:15:51,876 --> 01:15:54,527
- Dad hi!
- I am so proud of you Annie.

658
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,583
Thank you.

659
01:15:55,607 --> 01:15:58,783
Oh, Kate. Best speech of all others.

660
01:15:58,941 --> 01:15:59,981
- Thanks.
- Of course.

661
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,141
Yeah, I agree.

662
01:16:01,165 --> 01:16:03,205
- Ana? Hi.
- Hi.

663
01:16:03,961 --> 01:16:06,282
Ray, have you met Christian Grey?
Ana's new boyfriend?

664
01:16:06,317 --> 01:16:07,317
Hi.

665
01:16:07,808 --> 01:16:08,987
Great pleasure to meet you.

666
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:10,501
My pleasure. I really enjoyed your speech.

667
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,260
Thank you sir.

668
01:16:11,285 --> 01:16:13,466
Sounds like you've accomplished
some pretty impressive things.

669
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,379
And what things?

670
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,386
Thank you. - Okay, I'm gonna go find
my family, who are

671
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,231
impatiently waiting to embarrass me. Bye.

672
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:22,237
- Visit us soon yeah?
- Soon as I get an invitation.

673
01:16:23,009 --> 01:16:24,622
So, how long you two known each other?

674
01:16:26,234 --> 01:16:28,674
A few weeks now, we actually met when
Anastasia

675
01:16:28,694 --> 01:16:30,845
interviewed me for the student newspaper.

676
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:33,150
- A picture please Mr. Grey?
- One minute excuse me.

677
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:37,645
Big smile now.

678
01:16:47,481 --> 01:16:51,679
To celebrate your graduation.
Among other things.

679
01:16:55,271 --> 01:16:58,590
Roll your eyes at me again and
I will take you across my knee.

680
01:17:04,413 --> 01:17:05,664
So it begins.

681
01:17:09,822 --> 01:17:12,525
- Come on, I've got something to show you.
- What?

682
01:17:21,563 --> 01:17:25,934
That's cute. Doesn't really
seem like your style though.

683
01:17:26,358 --> 01:17:32,402
Its not, happy graduation Anastasia.

684
01:17:33,085 --> 01:17:36,455
Oh my god. Christian that's a car.

685
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:38,509
You don't miss much do you?

686
01:17:41,566 --> 01:17:43,723
Thank you but I can't. This is too...

687
01:17:43,947 --> 01:17:46,744
- Do you like it?
- Of course I like it, its beautiful.

688
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:53,320
But I have a car...
Where's my car?

689
01:17:53,344 --> 01:17:55,499
I told Taylor to fetch
a decent price for it.

690
01:17:55,523 --> 01:17:57,467
Christian, this is way too much.

691
01:17:57,491 --> 01:17:59,057
Did you just roll your eyes at me?

692
01:18:07,499 --> 01:18:10,492
- Do you know why I'm doing this?
- Because I rolled my eyes at you.

693
01:18:10,849 --> 01:18:12,059
And is that polite?

694
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:14,605
No.

695
01:18:14,714 --> 01:18:17,392
- Excuse me?
- No, sir.

696
01:18:36,424 --> 01:18:39,204
- Do you want more?
- Yes. Yes.

697
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:48,243
Welcome to my world.

698
01:19:10,156 --> 01:19:13,594
- What are you doing?
- There a few things at the office

699
01:19:13,618 --> 01:19:15,945
which require my attention.

700
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:17,545
You okay?

701
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:23,810
- I just thought that...
- I enjoyed tonight.

702
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,620
I'll see you at my place tomorrow.

703
01:19:58,705 --> 01:19:59,705
Hi mama.

704
01:19:59,729 --> 01:20:03,914
<i>Anastasia?, whats going on,
I've left you two messages this week.</i>

705
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:09,276
I know I'm sorry. I just
got a little distracted.

706
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,654
<i>I'm sorry I missed your graduation honey
I heard it was lovely.</i>

707
01:20:13,085 --> 01:20:14,513
And your new beau.

708
01:20:15,032 --> 01:20:18,195
Ray told me all about him, he
sounds such a young man.

709
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,229
<i>Of course, I would've preferred to
have heard about it from you.</i>

710
01:20:26,395 --> 01:20:27,482
Ana?

711
01:20:28,823 --> 01:20:29,898
<i>Whats the matter?</i>

712
01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:32,896
Nothing I'm fine.

713
01:20:33,672 --> 01:20:35,363
Is he not making you happy?

714
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:39,625
He is yeah, I mean most of the time yeah.

715
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:42,092
<i>Its complicated.</i>

716
01:20:44,643 --> 01:20:47,797
Listen honey, if you need a break,
you just

717
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:50,528
come on right down here.

718
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:52,349
<i>Even if its just for a day or two.</i>

719
01:20:52,373 --> 01:20:55,217
<i>I have air miles, and we could talk
and have girl time.</i>

720
01:20:56,805 --> 01:21:02,617
- Promise me you'll think about it?
- Yeah I promise. I promise.

721
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:07,197
- I love you mama.
- I love you too darling.

722
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:11,715
I gotta go. Bye.

723
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:22,345
<i>Looks like you and Grey did
some celebration last night.</i>

724
01:21:23,706 --> 01:21:27,782
- Is he still asleep?
- No, he couldn't stay.

725
01:21:28,506 --> 01:21:30,186
Well whose car keys are those then?

726
01:21:33,508 --> 01:21:37,184
- Those are my keys.
- Wow Ana.

727
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,300
What?

728
01:21:40,324 --> 01:21:41,961
Nothing, I'm just...

729
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:45,088
Make sure you're taking
it at your own pace okay?

730
01:21:45,112 --> 01:21:47,529
I am, I am, I gotta go.

731
01:21:47,553 --> 01:21:48,899
Where are you going?

732
01:21:56,796 --> 01:22:01,595
- Look at this.
- I've seen it, not a bad picture.

733
01:22:02,358 --> 01:22:04,191
Christian Grey and friend.

734
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:06,646
So we're friends.

735
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,422
Well it must be true,
if its in the paper.

736
01:22:11,028 --> 01:22:13,863
- So how did it go with Dr. Greene?
- It was fine.

737
01:22:13,987 --> 01:22:16,058
But she said I had to abstain from

738
01:22:16,093 --> 01:22:18,448
all sexual activity for four weeks.

739
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:20,232
You know, after I start the pill.

740
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,243
What?

741
01:22:24,396 --> 01:22:25,396
Just kidding.

742
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,651
I wanna take you to my playroom.

743
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:51,198
- I haven't signed the contract.
- I'm well aware. Call it a free sample.

744
01:22:52,486 --> 01:22:53,581
Okay.

745
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:00,700
Ready?

746
01:23:35,459 --> 01:23:40,423
Eyes down. Take off your shoes.

747
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:46,068
Arms above your head.

748
01:23:52,044 --> 01:23:54,637
You have a beautiful body Anastasia.

749
01:24:00,163 --> 01:24:02,558
I want you unashamed of
your nakedness, understand?

750
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:05,487
Yes sir.

751
01:24:07,467 --> 01:24:11,007
Stop biting your lip, you know what it does
to me. Turn around.

752
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:23,157
When I tell you to come into this room
This is how you'll be.

753
01:24:25,108 --> 01:24:26,308
You'll wait for me.

754
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:29,344
Kneeling by the door.

755
01:24:40,184 --> 01:24:44,873
Hands flat on your thighs.
Good.

756
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:18,595
Hold out your hands.

757
01:25:45,434 --> 01:25:48,637
- Did that hurt?
- No.

758
01:25:48,925 --> 01:25:52,066
You see? Much of your fear is in your head.

759
01:25:53,753 --> 01:25:54,883
Come.

760
01:28:14,135 --> 01:28:17,542
- How does that feel?
- Good.

761
01:28:38,451 --> 01:28:39,605
Quiet.

762
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,755
Where are we going?

763
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:20,618
Remember my mother mentioned dinner?

764
01:30:21,413 --> 01:30:22,792
My sister Mia's in town.

765
01:30:23,589 --> 01:30:24,589
Yes.

766
01:30:28,153 --> 01:30:31,739
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah.

767
01:30:33,293 --> 01:30:34,352
Dance with me.

768
01:31:22,299 --> 01:31:23,942
Good evening Mr. Grey.

769
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:24,977
They're here!

770
01:31:25,362 --> 01:31:26,362
You're here.

771
01:31:26,529 --> 01:31:29,485
- Welcome welcome.
- Ana, you've met my mother.

772
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,439
Hi, lovely to see you.

773
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,650
This is my father, Carrick.
Hi, its nice to meet you.

774
01:31:32,685 --> 01:31:33,636
Pleasure to meet you.

775
01:31:33,671 --> 01:31:34,201
<i>Is she here?</i>

776
01:31:34,236 --> 01:31:35,800
There's been a lot of speculation!

777
01:31:35,867 --> 01:31:37,933
Oh my god! She exists!

778
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:41,997
Its a great apartment, and
the rent's not ridiculous

779
01:31:42,385 --> 01:31:44,219
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.

780
01:31:45,101 --> 01:31:49,208
Jose is Ana's friend, although I
think Elliot's trying to poach me.

781
01:31:49,243 --> 01:31:52,630
He's a cool guy!

782
01:31:53,632 --> 01:31:55,805
Ana, where is your family from?

783
01:31:56,113 --> 01:31:59,403
My step father's in Montesano and
my mom lives in Georgia.

784
01:31:59,467 --> 01:32:01,814
- Georgia? Which part?
- Savannah.

785
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:06,987
How nice! Although I hear it gets really
humid in Georgia this time of year.

786
01:32:07,171 --> 01:32:10,495
Oh my god it does. Its stifling sometimes.

787
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:12,427
Actually I'm going to visit her tomorrow.

788
01:32:12,601 --> 01:32:15,939
How nice. You hear that Christian?

789
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:19,124
Some children do visit their
parents now and again.

790
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,623
- Hey dad you catch the Mariners game?
- I heard it went back stream.

791
01:32:27,322 --> 01:32:29,098
This is news to me. When
were you gonna tell me?

792
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:31,254
<i>I think it was alright though.</i>

793
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:33,597
Who wants coffee?

794
01:32:33,918 --> 01:32:36,898
Actually I promised Ana
a tour of the grounds.

795
01:32:37,605 --> 01:32:38,681
Excuse us.

796
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:46,788
Christian, I cannot walk
that fast in these shoes.

797
01:32:50,805 --> 01:32:52,247
When were you gonna tell me about Georgia?

798
01:32:52,471 --> 01:32:55,108
What? You have no right to be mad at me.

799
01:32:55,132 --> 01:32:57,322
Yeah but I am mad. Palm-twitchingly mad.

800
01:33:02,435 --> 01:33:04,922
You're mine. All mine. Understand?

801
01:33:12,358 --> 01:33:14,342
Christian, you're so confusing.

802
01:33:18,476 --> 01:33:20,356
- Ana.
- What do you want?

803
01:33:22,274 --> 01:33:24,560
- What do you want?
- I want you.

804
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,120
I'm trying, Christian.

805
01:33:32,405 --> 01:33:33,578
I know you are.

806
01:33:34,568 --> 01:33:36,675
Why can't we sleep in the same bed?

807
01:33:37,614 --> 01:33:42,017
Why won't you let me touch you?
Why does it have to be like this?

808
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,438
If you would just sign the
contract you wouldn't have...

809
01:33:51,473 --> 01:33:53,620
Why do you care so much about
the contract Christian?

810
01:33:53,644 --> 01:33:57,614
- Don't you like me the way I am?
- Of course I do.

811
01:33:57,638 --> 01:34:01,361
- Then why are you trying to change me?
- I'm not.

812
01:34:02,977 --> 01:34:06,531
- Its you.
- I need more, I want more.

813
01:34:08,246 --> 01:34:12,241
Hearts and flowers?
That's not something I know

814
01:34:14,432 --> 01:34:20,051
Ana please - its you that is changing me.

815
01:34:22,175 --> 01:34:25,961
Let me touch you. Let me.

816
01:34:40,428 --> 01:34:45,001
- Are they burns?
- I had a rough start in life.

817
01:34:45,425 --> 01:34:50,321
- That's all you need to know.
- Okay.

818
01:35:13,388 --> 01:35:18,139
The woman who gave birth to me,
was a crack addict.

819
01:35:19,391 --> 01:35:20,653
And a prostitute.

820
01:35:25,689 --> 01:35:27,483
She died when I was four.

821
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:38,117
I remember certain things. Terrible things.

822
01:35:42,384 --> 01:35:43,923
I don't remember her.

823
01:35:47,985 --> 01:35:53,700
Sometimes, I can see her in my dreams.

824
01:36:13,717 --> 01:36:15,457
Do you really have to go to Georgia?

825
01:36:20,139 --> 01:36:21,599
Yeah, I really.

826
01:36:44,615 --> 01:36:47,398
- This gazpacho is really salty Bob.
- Yeah.

827
01:36:47,422 --> 01:36:50,018
You'll get fat with all this sitting around
You tell him Ana.

828
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:53,081
- I'm not gonna tell him that.
- Yes thank you Ana.

829
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:56,887
I'm just saying gazpacho
is in a bowl of salsa.

830
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,663
Now could you hand me some
chips for my bowl of salsa?

831
01:36:59,698 --> 01:37:01,114
You can have a carrot?

832
01:37:02,376 --> 01:37:04,247
What are you getting
at with this?

833
01:37:05,008 --> 01:37:08,768
You're lucky that I happen
to love you - very much.

834
01:37:08,792 --> 01:37:10,736
- I know that.
- Do you?

835
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:11,813
Hmm, I do.

836
01:38:48,906 --> 01:38:50,670
Oh darling, I think we
should pace ourselves,

837
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:52,151
or at least order
something to eat.

838
01:38:52,175 --> 01:38:54,398
You go ahead,
 I'm not very hungry.

839
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:56,809
Oh, I just have the fruit salad.

840
01:39:02,027 --> 01:39:05,585
- He can wait.
- Mom.

841
01:39:08,983 --> 01:39:10,563
- Holy fuck.
- What?

842
01:39:10,953 --> 01:39:12,114
What is it?

843
01:39:12,138 --> 01:39:17,050
Its Christian, he's here, in Georgia.

844
01:39:19,646 --> 01:39:22,263
- Here, here!
- Mrs Adams.

845
01:39:22,298 --> 01:39:23,595
Delighted to meet you.

846
01:39:23,819 --> 01:39:26,228
- Something to drink sir?
- Gin and tonic.

847
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,793
Hendrix if you have it,
otherwise Bombay Sapphire.

848
01:39:28,817 --> 01:39:31,341
Cucumber with the Hendricks,
lime with Bombay.

849
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:34,810
- I like him already.
- What are you doing here Christian?

850
01:39:34,934 --> 01:39:38,178
- I came to see you.
- I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

851
01:39:48,943 --> 01:39:51,482
I broke rule 7, clause 5.

852
01:39:53,683 --> 01:39:58,842
We'll let it go, lets not talk
about the contract right now.

853
01:39:59,444 --> 01:40:00,905
How was your dinner?

854
01:40:04,683 --> 01:40:07,387
She's a friend, that's all.

855
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,008
She knows me.

856
01:40:14,077 --> 01:40:18,807
- What did she advise you to do?
- Well I'm here.

857
01:40:21,447 --> 01:40:25,096
- Now what?
- I've got a room in this hotel.

858
01:40:27,117 --> 01:40:28,876
Well I hope you'll be comfortable in it.

859
01:40:33,501 --> 01:40:35,302
What are you doing for breakfast tomorrow?

860
01:40:40,977 --> 01:40:43,975
- Where are we going?
- Its a surprise.

861
01:40:44,568 --> 01:40:47,211
I think I've reached my quota of surprises.

862
01:40:48,819 --> 01:40:50,068
We're almost there.

863
01:40:58,006 --> 01:41:00,651
Mr Grey? Hey, I'll be your co-pilot.

864
01:41:00,675 --> 01:41:03,298
How do you do? This is my girlfriend,
Anastasia Steele.

865
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:37,243
<i>We're at 400 feet, ready?</i>

866
01:41:37,567 --> 01:41:40,590
- Ready?
- Yes, ready.

867
01:41:40,814 --> 01:41:42,180
Release.

868
01:42:11,696 --> 01:42:12,904
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

869
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:18,782
- Is this more?
- Oh my god. So much more!

870
01:42:39,733 --> 01:42:44,247
Oh my god, that was incredible Christian.
Thank you.

871
01:42:44,371 --> 01:42:46,279
We aim to please Miss Steele.

872
01:42:47,293 --> 01:42:52,618
- I thought you didn't do romance.
- I don't. Ana.

873
01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:57,094
What? What?
Why are you fighting this?

874
01:43:00,296 --> 01:43:01,916
What are you afraid of?

875
01:43:12,421 --> 01:43:16,884
Grey. What? When?

876
01:43:19,125 --> 01:43:23,005
Have Stefan get the plane ready.
I'll be on the tarmac in 30 minutes.

877
01:43:23,429 --> 01:43:25,903
- What happened?
- I have to go back to Seattle.

878
01:43:26,427 --> 01:43:27,647
Come I'll take you home.

879
01:43:30,099 --> 01:43:32,168
Oh sweetheart, I wish
Christian could've stayed

880
01:43:32,203 --> 01:43:34,895
Bob was looking forward to meeting him.

881
01:43:34,919 --> 01:43:39,837
I know, he had to get back to Seattle
though. There's a um, situation at work.

882
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:43,393
I wish I could tell you things get easier,
but they don't.

883
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:46,411
You just need to get to
know yourself better.

884
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:50,615
- Thank you for everything mama.
- Take care.

885
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:51,650
I will.

886
01:44:11,668 --> 01:44:14,682
You think I wouldn't recognise you Taylor?

887
01:44:14,872 --> 01:44:16,194
Right this way Miss Steele.

888
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:26,221
- How does he seem Taylor?
- Preoccupied I'm afraid.

889
01:44:27,034 --> 01:44:29,501
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.

890
01:44:35,768 --> 01:44:37,185
Well that's not gonna work.

891
01:44:39,521 --> 01:44:40,639
What?

892
01:44:42,655 --> 01:44:48,166
Well tell them they don't have 24 hours.
That is unacceptable.

893
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:51,540
I need to know. Just keep me informed.

894
01:45:07,847 --> 01:45:13,426
- Is everything okay?
- Nothing that concerns you.

895
01:45:15,494 --> 01:45:17,888
- I can leave if you want me to go?
- No.

896
01:45:19,653 --> 01:45:21,335
That's the last thing I want.

897
01:45:27,908 --> 01:45:32,160
I want you, in the playroom, in 15 minutes.

898
01:46:00,075 --> 01:46:03,786
- What are your safe words?
- Red and yellow.

899
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:05,306
Remember them.

900
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:19,176
That sounds so sad. Everything you play
sounds sad.

901
01:48:21,174 --> 01:48:22,981
You said you were six and when you learned,

902
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:25,839
was it because you wanted
to please your new family?

903
01:48:34,525 --> 01:48:36,091
I just wanna talk.

904
01:48:40,290 --> 01:48:42,130
Why won't you let me in?

905
01:48:44,687 --> 01:48:47,248
- We should be talking.
- Like normal people?

906
01:48:47,631 --> 01:48:48,722
Yeah.

907
01:48:52,393 --> 01:48:53,860
Is that so wrong?

908
01:49:06,384 --> 01:49:09,479
Is this because of the contract?
Because I still haven't signed it?

909
01:49:10,123 --> 01:49:14,321
Fuck the contract, I think its a
little redundant don't you?

910
01:49:15,769 --> 01:49:17,912
So then the rules are redundant too?

911
01:49:18,182 --> 01:49:21,857
- No. The rules stand.
- And what if I break them?

912
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:24,721
- Then there'll be consequences.
- Punishment?

913
01:49:25,224 --> 01:49:26,224
Yes.

914
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:29,676
- Why do you want to punish me?
- Ana.

915
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:31,673
Why do you want to hurt me?

916
01:49:34,806 --> 01:49:37,611
I would never do anything to you,
that you couldn't handle.

917
01:49:37,646 --> 01:49:40,626
But why do you even wanna do anything
at all to me Christian?

918
01:49:42,647 --> 01:49:45,868
If I told you, you'd never look at me
the same way again.

919
01:49:46,824 --> 01:49:50,316
So there is a reason. Tell me.

920
01:49:52,584 --> 01:49:54,790
- Do you wanna punish me right now?
- Yes.

921
01:49:55,114 --> 01:49:57,143
I wanna punish you right now.

922
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:02,636
What if I told you that I feel the same
way about being punished as you

923
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:05,262
do about me touching you, would
you still wanna punish me then?

924
01:50:07,917 --> 01:50:11,215
No. But that doesn't
mean I wouldn't need to.

925
01:50:11,344 --> 01:50:13,267
- Why?
- Ana stop.

926
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:15,865
- Why do you need...
- Because its the way I am!

927
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:26,140
Because I'm 50 shades of fucked up.

928
01:50:49,391 --> 01:50:50,741
Show me then.

929
01:51:04,858 --> 01:51:09,861
I need you to show me, what
you wanna do to me.

930
01:51:10,512 --> 01:51:13,036
Punish me, show me how bad it can be.

931
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:14,892
I want you to show me the worst.

932
01:51:22,964 --> 01:51:24,817
Its the only way I can understand.

933
01:51:38,919 --> 01:51:42,128
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

934
01:51:59,202 --> 01:52:00,375
Bend over.

935
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:13,625
I'm gonna hit you six times.
And you're gonna count with me.

936
01:52:26,095 --> 01:52:30,423
- Count, Anastasia.
- One.

937
01:52:36,295 --> 01:52:37,521
Two.

938
01:52:46,211 --> 01:52:47,211
Three.

939
01:52:58,072 --> 01:52:59,365
Four.

940
01:53:06,931 --> 01:53:08,143
Five.

941
01:53:22,012 --> 01:53:23,170
Six.

942
01:53:42,423 --> 01:53:46,298
Is this what you really want?
You wanna see me like this?

943
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,618
- Ana.
- Don't come near me.

944
01:53:57,654 --> 01:53:59,302
Does this give you pleasure?

945
01:54:02,599 --> 01:54:03,599
No.

946
01:54:08,849 --> 01:54:10,725
Don't you dare come near me.

947
01:55:14,793 --> 01:55:16,261
Please don't hate me.

948
01:55:19,446 --> 01:55:21,549
You will never do that to me again.

949
01:55:30,444 --> 01:55:35,524
- I'm not what you want.
- No, you are everything that I want.

950
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:46,143
I've fallen in love with you.

951
01:55:50,173 --> 01:55:53,967
No. No, Ana. You can't love me.

952
01:56:07,383 --> 01:56:08,913
I need you to leave.

953
01:56:15,771 --> 01:56:16,982
Please.

954
01:57:11,219 --> 01:57:16,287
- I'd like my car back.
- Taylor already sold it.

955
01:57:18,668 --> 01:57:20,862
Then I'd like the money
he got for it please.

956
01:57:22,554 --> 01:57:23,908
I'll send you a check.

957
01:57:24,815 --> 01:57:25,815
Okay.

958
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,341
Taylor will take you home.

959
01:57:51,238 --> 01:57:52,238
Stop.

960
01:57:52,927 --> 01:57:53,935
No!

961
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:11,481
- Ana.
- Christian.
