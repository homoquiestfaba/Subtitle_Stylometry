1
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:26,181
I remember a world
with no wars...

2
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:28,581
no warriors.

3
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:31,519
All that has changed.

4
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:34,853
Now I see a dying land.

5
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:37,155
And the enemy grows stronger.

6
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:41,229
Is there someone
with the courage...

7
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:43,493
to step f orward?

8
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,893
But I f ear f or him...

9
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:50,201
as I f ear f or us.

10
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:20,195
Ryan! Breakf ast is on the table.
I've gotta run, honey.

11
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,704
Be back around 5:00.
Bye.

12
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,473
Shoot.

13
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,570
Bravo, no.
Look, where's Ryan?

14
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,345
Go on. You go find him.
Make sure he eats his breakf ast.

15
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,599
Yeah.

16
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,237
What?

17
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:04,939
Do you mind?

18
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,175
Dog.

19
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,995
Yeah.

20
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:00,235
- Hey, Ryan!
- Yeah?

21
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,168
To your right.

22
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:16,847
Have I told you
about the real kung fu masters?

23
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,321
Then let go
of your limitations.

24
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,791
Imagine a world
beyond anything you've ever seen.

25
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,490
A world of no worries, of perf ect bliss,
where anything can happen.

26
00:03:28,565 --> 00:03:31,193
A world def ended
by great warriors.

27
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:34,725
No guns, no lasers,
no morphing.

28
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:37,568
They use the f orces of nature
as their weapons.

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,336
Fire, metal...

30
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,378
wood...

31
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:43,878
water...

32
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:47,112
and earth.

33
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:50,710
Warriors who fight
f or integrity and honor...

34
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:54,416
sail upon their enemies
with the grace of a dancer...

35
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,982
and knock them senseless...

36
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,585
with the touch of a f eather.

37
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,929
Well, it's cooking time.

38
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,831
Hey, Ming.

39
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,841
Are they real?

40
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:16,212
Ancient Chinese secret.

41
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:21,946
Red f or 12!

42
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:26,350
Set, hut!

43
00:04:26,423 --> 00:04:28,721
- Go!
- Go, Ken!

44
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:38,394
- We can still win.
- There's no way they can make it.

45
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:40,402
Time out!

46
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:44,300
- Red team.
- Ryan, Chucky, today!

47
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:45,807
Coming, Coach.

48
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:50,235
- Guys, we have time f or one more play.
- Here you go.

49
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:53,942
We're gonna sweep left. No, we're gonna
sweep right. Toby, you get the ball.

50
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:57,783
No way, Coach. Left tackle's
been bustin' through the line all game.

51
00:04:57,854 --> 00:05:02,018
Hey, I've played a f ew games
in my day, son. Okay?

52
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:05,618
I said sweep right, so we're
gonna sweep right. Now let's go!

53
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,629
- We can do it.
- Yeah, it's a good play.

54
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,631
- Brad.
- Guys, throw 'em over here.

55
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,132
Thanks.

56
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,967
Their right saf ety comes in
on every running play.

57
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,100
If you f ake to Toby, then bootleg left,
you have a clear path to the end zone.

58
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,473
Sure, "Coach."

59
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:26,845
All right. Ready!

60
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,907
- Break!
- Gimp!

61
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:30,384
Let's go, Ry.

62
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:40,924
Blue 42! Go!

63
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:49,829
Hut!

64
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,982
All right! Way to go!

65
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,955
Wow!

66
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,019
Yes!

67
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:53,529
All right!

68
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,036
Nice call.

69
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,140
Thanks, Chucky.

70
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:47,154
You got dissed, man.
It was your call.

71
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:49,157
What's the diff erence?

72
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:51,989
You. That's the whole point.

73
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:54,222
- You made the diff erence.
- Watch out!

74
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:57,494
Hey, we're walkin' here!
Hey, Brad!

75
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,626
Ryan called your winning play.

76
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,228
Aren't you gonna thank him?

77
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:11,303
Did you say somethin',
or did you f art?

78
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:13,645
Ryan called the play.
You heard him.

79
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,775
And he told you
exactly what to do.

80
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:20,152
Oh, really? I thought you said
that was your ingenious idea.

81
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,456
Bootleg left,
clear path to the end zone.

82
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,021
- That was a great call, man.
- Thanks.

83
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:33,762
Too bad you can't play ball.
You're pretty smart.

84
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:36,199
Come on.
Let's get lost.

85
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:38,433
Wait a second.

86
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,738
You want to hang out
with us tonight?

87
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,779
- Yeah. Sure.
- Cool.

88
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:48,613
Well, we'll be around
the Orono tunnel about 8:00.

89
00:08:48,685 --> 00:08:51,017
- Great. We'll be there.
- All right.

90
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:55,184
You too, Upchuck.

91
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,023
Break.

92
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:06,663
You got a death wish, man?
I mean, the guy's evil.

93
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:09,170
Lucif er thinks
he's a little extreme.

94
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:15,474
- He's up to somethin'.
- So you're not comin'?

95
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:17,479
I didn't say that.

96
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:20,175
After all, you're the man.

97
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:23,013
See you there.

98
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:24,951
Pass!

99
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,579
Touchdown!

100
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:29,819
An incredible pass from the man
simply known as...

101
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,325
"Ry."

102
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,295
- Darn.
- Hey, Mom.

103
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,737
The man I was looking f or.
Dinner's almost served.

104
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:49,437
Fabulous frozen. Got a showing in 20
minutes, so you'll have to eat alone.

105
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:52,413
- How was your game?
- We won.

106
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:55,178
Brad got a touchdown
on the last play.

107
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,155
- I came up with the play.
- Really?

108
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,351
Hey, that's great.
I'm very proud of you.

109
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:06,725
Proud of what?
I didn't score the touchdown.

110
00:10:06,796 --> 00:10:08,388
That's okay.

111
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,625
- Yeah, right.
- No, it is. You're a part of that team.

112
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:16,638
And it sounds to me like
they couldn't have won without you.

113
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:24,679
When's Dad getting back?

114
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:28,547
Now, are you saying that your f ather is
a better cook than your mother?

115
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,142
No off ense.

116
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:41,860
Oh, yes, you are gonna
need something.

117
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,461
- How about Min's? My treat.
- Ming, Mom.

118
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:51,063
You've only been there
a hundred times.

119
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,975
Yeah, Ming. I know.

120
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:58,979
Look, your mama's losing her mind, going
in and out of that door all day long.

121
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,975
You bear with me
a little longer?

122
00:11:11,928 --> 00:11:14,863
I'll be back
in a couple hours.

123
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:44,458
Sorry.

124
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:51,825
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

125
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,511
You okay, Mr. Lang? It's slippery here.
You gotta watch your step.

126
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,124
- What's goin' on?
- Oh, nothin'.

127
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,987
Come on.

128
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,532
- What's got you singin' the blues?
- Nothin'.

129
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,833
Come on.
I got somethin' f or you.

130
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:31,999
- What is it?
- Come on.

131
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:38,842
I'll be right there.

132
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,613
What's this?

133
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:49,622
Oh, I f ound that
when I was about your age.

134
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:51,626
It's a cocoon.

135
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,573
I was on my way home
from school.

136
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:14,275
I saw it lying on the ground,
just sitting there...

137
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,012
moving around,
something inside.

138
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:19,384
I got on my hands and knees
and looked close...

139
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:22,151
and I see this moth
struggling to get out.

140
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:26,285
But he couldn't do it. So I reached down
and tore open the cocoon.

141
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:30,196
And out he came.
Takes off into the air and flies away.

142
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:34,259
But then, all of a sudden,
down he came into the ground.

143
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:35,770
Dead.

144
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,937
What happened?

145
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,501
I interrupted his journey.

146
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,638
We all have cocoons.

147
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:49,845
The struggle to free ourselves makes us
whole and gives us the strength to fly.

148
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:54,278
It's pretty hard to fly
when you have a broken wing.

149
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:56,291
Always so certain of that,
aren't you?

150
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:04,824
Ancient Chinese secret,
remember?

151
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,767
- A book?
- No, a manuscript.

152
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:11,329
I was like you once.
Never f elt I was good enough.

153
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,341
Always wanted to be
like someone else.

154
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:17,505
But this-- this helped me become
the person I wanted to be.

155
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,411
A cook?

156
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,848
No. Myself.

157
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,712
This is Tao.

158
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,952
It means the way to something, yourself,
being the person you want to be.

159
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:37,193
I got all the self-help books I need
from my mom. She doesn't get it either.

160
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:40,802
This isn't like the books
your mom gave you.

161
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,497
I gotta go.

162
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,631
Check it out.

163
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:48,568
- It's yours.
- Catch you later.

164
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,478
Man, this place makes me itch.

165
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:03,582
- This is creepy. Let's get outta here.
- What?

166
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,356
This is our ticket,
so don't blow it.

167
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,522
We're in.

168
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:25,011
So you boys decided
to show up.

169
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:32,250
So what are we gonna do here?

170
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:34,755
We're gonna play
f ollow the leader.

171
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,261
You're the leader.

172
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:48,528
- It's a bad idea.
- Just relax, okay?

173
00:15:48,604 --> 00:15:51,038
No. See? I told you
somethin' was up.

174
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:53,200
And I bet
it's gonna get worse.

175
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,800
I bet they're gonna carve
their initials into our chest...

176
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:58,346
or make hot dogs
out of our wieners.

177
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:02,748
- Hot dogs with meatballs on the side.
- Shut up.

178
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:19,961
Me, oh, my. You know, I just remembered,
I have a Spanish test tomorrow.

179
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:45,088
To hang with us,
you gotta be initiated.

180
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,654
Come on, you wussies! Let's go!

181
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:20,860
- All right, guys.
- Wait.

182
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,792
All right.
Now, this is simple.

183
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:29,360
All you gotta do is walk across
and give us an autograph.

184
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:40,575
- Make your mark.
- You said you wouldn't make him do it.

185
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,048
He can't.

186
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:44,449
- Don't listen to him.
- We all did it.

187
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,853
You want in? It's up to you.

188
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:50,323
- Don't.
- He's a wussy.

189
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:52,485
- Don't do it.
- Don't.

190
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:59,025
Fine. I'll meet you
on the other side.

191
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,998
- Baby!
- All right, man. Come on!

192
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:05,734
Take a swim today?

193
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,241
Shut up!

194
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,215
- Watch out.
- Don't slip, man.

195
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,380
- Watch it!
- Yeah!

196
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,949
Come on! Yeah!

197
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:30,031
Come on, Jeff ers.
Are you cool?

198
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:32,363
Let's go.
Come on, buddy.

199
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:36,004
Come on.

200
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,631
He's just making fun of you.

201
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:41,870
Man, this is stupid.
Make like Tom and "cruise."

202
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:46,278
Shut up. I can do this, okay?
Look, he did it.

203
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:48,782
Yeah. But you're not him.

204
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,884
- Damn.
- Let's go!

205
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,284
- He's picking up the can.
- Are you afraid?

206
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,130
- Come on!
- Come on down.

207
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,631
- Don't do it!
- Shut up.

208
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,067
- Come on. You got it.
- You got it. Keep goin'.

209
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,298
You guys, don't distract him.

210
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:13,398
- He's gonna f all in!
- Hey, big guy, you got it.

211
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:15,807
Come on.

212
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:18,745
Come on! You got it.

213
00:19:18,814 --> 00:19:21,112
What are you doing?

214
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:23,708
Go f or it!

215
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:28,382
You're movin' like a baby! Why don't you
just get down and crawl? Come on!

216
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:29,822
- Stop it!
- Come on.

217
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:34,022
Come on! You got it!

218
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:37,088
- Don't look down!
- That's it. Yes!

219
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:43,534
Hey, you see that?

220
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,438
- What?
- He's freakin'.

221
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:49,875
You never know when it's gonna
take a dump. You gotta be quick.

222
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:55,147
Come on! Let's go.
You gotta be quick.

223
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,719
Come on!

224
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,722
What is that?

225
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:17,196
Grab him!

226
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,942
- Oh, my God!
- Get him out!

227
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:01,275
What--

228
00:22:01,343 --> 00:22:02,776
Dry?

229
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,880
Tracy?

230
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,927
Come on, guys.
Cut it out.

231
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:20,928
Look, this isn't funny.

232
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:25,065
Bravo!

233
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,345
Hey, you!

234
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:49,053
Gotcha!

235
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:08,733
Oh, my God.

236
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:10,237
It works.

237
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:15,066
My leg.

238
00:24:15,143 --> 00:24:17,475
It works.

239
00:24:17,546 --> 00:24:20,208
It works! Yes!

240
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:33,758
Set!

241
00:24:33,829 --> 00:24:35,319
Blue 42!

242
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:37,388
Set! Hike!

243
00:24:37,466 --> 00:24:39,525
Jeff ers spins
past the def enders!

244
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:41,796
Oh, he cuts back,
spinning, stiff-arming!

245
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,361
Back to the sidelines.
He goes.

246
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:47,340
He's spinning past the def enders.
Split the stiff-arm!

247
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:51,311
Spins again.
Fumble! But Jeff ers recovers.

248
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,713
He spins back to mid-field.
At the ten! The five--

249
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:02,915
- Get off me!
- You're not getting away, Newcomer!

250
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,586
- Let go! No!
- No such luck.

251
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:08,687
Let go, punk.

252
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,433
Hold your blade!

253
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:16,596
Who's there?

254
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:22,509
- Are you hurt?
- He's a Newcomer, Elysia.

255
00:25:22,577 --> 00:25:26,570
Came right up out of the river.
I saw it with my own eyes.

256
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:28,115
And he's mine!

257
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:32,183
You're really a Newcomer?

258
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:34,950
I just f ell in the water.

259
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:37,617
I slipped,
and then those things...

260
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:40,924
they came out,
and they tried to kill me.

261
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:43,055
Those were Komodo's men.

262
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,793
We're not saf e here.
Come on.

263
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,062
Elysia, a little reward
f or my eff orts?

264
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:57,811
Virtue be yours!

265
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:10,624
Your patrol was sent to spy
on their Lif espring, Commander.

266
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:14,389
- You were not supposed to be seen.
- General, we were attacked.

267
00:26:14,463 --> 00:26:17,557
Well, you can explain it
to him yourself.

268
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:23,137
He's not happy.

269
00:26:34,683 --> 00:26:36,116
Bye-bye!

270
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:43,623
Commander.

271
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:46,558
Failure...

272
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:49,062
is in your eyes.

273
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:54,898
An open wound inf ects
like a disease...

274
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,302
and it spreads...

275
00:26:57,372 --> 00:27:00,364
like an inf ection.

276
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:12,485
I smell f ear.

277
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:17,320
Fear of what?

278
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:20,388
Death?

279
00:27:20,462 --> 00:27:22,191
My lord...

280
00:27:22,264 --> 00:27:23,788
please.

281
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:27,062
Look.
I brought you this.

282
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,900
It's from a boy.
He's a Newcomer.

283
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:34,407
Newcomer?

284
00:27:44,586 --> 00:27:45,678
Rise.

285
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:50,856
Slowly stand up.
Don't be afraid.

286
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:54,992
I want to take away
your terror.

287
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,561
There is nothing to f ear...

288
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,431
because...

289
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:03,403
nothing dies.

290
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:08,541
Listen.

291
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:13,144
Lif e...

292
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:15,581
is but a dream...

293
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,811
flowing into another dream.

294
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:23,884
Bye.

295
00:28:33,568 --> 00:28:35,900
General Grillo...

296
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,064
I ask you this:

297
00:28:38,139 --> 00:28:40,130
What's the point of power...

298
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,802
if you don't abuse people?

299
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:47,681
Open it.

300
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,627
My lord,
it's the symbol of Tao!

301
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,637
Could this be the--

302
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:13,097
the manuscript?

303
00:29:17,012 --> 00:29:19,207
Lieutenants!

304
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,550
At last.

305
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:41,768
Find this Newcomer
and bring him to me.

306
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:43,531
Pleasure, my lord.

307
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:45,630
Alive.

308
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:57,644
Who are you?
Where am I?

309
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,243
I'm Elysia.

310
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:01,448
You're in Tao.

311
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:04,321
- Tao?
- Yes, Tao.

312
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:09,491
The manuscript. I thought it was
just a story. I didn't believe him.

313
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:12,465
What manuscript?
What does it look like?

314
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:19,997
- That. It has that on the cover.
- The Manuscript of Legend?

315
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:24,239
- The what?
- The Manuscript of Legend.

316
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:28,681
Master Chung once told us about
an ancient book that had special powers.

317
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:32,709
He said, if it was ever returned to Tao,
it could change everything.

318
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:35,847
- Who's Master Chung?
- He's our leader.

319
00:30:35,924 --> 00:30:39,018
When he came to Tao,
he taught ways of peace and harmony.

320
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:41,358
But it didn't last.

321
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:50,099
Komodo began mining the Lif espring
f or a mineral called zubrium.

322
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:52,503
The Lif esprings are
where we live.

323
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,804
They radiate energy
to all of Tao.

324
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:57,470
Without zubrium
they die out.

325
00:30:57,545 --> 00:31:01,242
Komodo uses the zubrium
to keep himself young and strong.

326
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:06,276
That's why he's so desperate f or it.
Now only one Lif espring remains.

327
00:31:06,354 --> 00:31:08,822
Can't anyone stop him?

328
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,688
No, not even
the Warriors of Virtue.

329
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,093
Warriors? Kung fu?
What do they look like?

330
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,630
They're Rooz.

331
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:24,938
This is our Lif espring.

332
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,103
Listen to me,
citizens of Tao.

333
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:02,041
Please calm yourselves.

334
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,342
- We cannot let our f ears def eat us.
- We must remain calm.

335
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:09,975
The Warriors of Virtue
will protect us!

336
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:13,953
But Master Chung,
has Yun returned?

337
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:17,490
He has not.

338
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,357
Then how can
the Warriors of Virtue protect us...

339
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:23,226
if there are
only f our of them?

340
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:28,099
Komodo's soldiers have already
been spotted inside the green.

341
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:31,002
- What are we going to do?
- We're doomed!

342
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,067
Oh, we're dead!

343
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:38,442
Listen to me, please!

344
00:32:38,513 --> 00:32:40,743
Master Chung, we have hope.

345
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:44,251
- A Newcomer has arrived.
- Newcomer?

346
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:48,722
He's too small
to be a Newcomer.

347
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:58,431
Houston,
we have a problem.

348
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:16,975
Newcomer, Elysia said
you have brought the manuscript.

349
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,518
May I see it?

350
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:24,319
It is important, Newcomer.

351
00:33:24,392 --> 00:33:26,519
The name is Ryan Jeff ers.

352
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,992
Show me the Warriors of Virtue,
please?

353
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:50,445
I trained these five warriors
to protect Tao.

354
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:53,078
Each upholds honor...

355
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:55,054
and integrity.

356
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,250
Do they fight with kung fu?

357
00:33:57,325 --> 00:34:00,988
They use the f orce
of nature's elements:

358
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:03,121
wood, fire...

359
00:34:03,198 --> 00:34:05,462
earth, metal...

360
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,831
and water.

361
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:09,699
Ming was right.

362
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:23,745
This is Lai,
virtue of order...

363
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:26,378
the stability of wood.

364
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,945
Meticulous, logical...

365
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,514
often a bit cranky.

366
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,232
Tsun, the virtue
of Ioyalty...

367
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:50,573
security of earth.

368
00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:53,341
Kind and nurturing.

369
00:35:16,604 --> 00:35:19,937
Chi, virtue
of high wisdom...

370
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:21,976
power of fire.

371
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:24,477
Often playful...

372
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:26,479
but very wise.

373
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:35,852
Yee, virtue
of righteousness...

374
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:38,153
strength of metal.

375
00:35:38,226 --> 00:35:42,890
He does not speak,
seeing every choice as right or wrong.

376
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:46,297
- Nothing in between.
- You said there were five.

377
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,200
Yes. The other is Yun...

378
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,033
their leader.

379
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:55,599
Virtue of benevolence,
f orce of water.

380
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:57,338
Where is he?

381
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:02,810
Yun has lost
his will to fight.

382
00:36:07,322 --> 00:36:09,256
God, they're so cool.

383
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:10,882
Uh-oh.

384
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,949
But not ready!

385
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:48,028
Don't be afraid.
This is Yee.

386
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:50,155
Ryan. How's it goin'?

387
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:53,291
It's all right.
This is Chi...

388
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:56,401
Tsun...

389
00:36:57,772 --> 00:36:59,171
and Lai.

390
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:04,969
He is a Newcomer, and he has brought
something important to us.

391
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:13,284
Now, Ryan Jeff ers,
may we see the manuscript?

392
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:20,525
Look, I don't have it.
One of you guys has it.

393
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:22,790
Us?

394
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:25,992
When you saved me from Komodo's
soldiers, it was in my backpack.

395
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:30,834
- At the river. Remember?
- Backpack? What's a backpack?

396
00:37:30,905 --> 00:37:32,338
Yun knows where it is.

397
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:37,166
If the Newcomer was saved at the river,
it would have been Yun.

398
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:41,579
- Forget Yun.
- But what if he can help?

399
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:45,915
Yun does not care about our cause
anymore. He will not help.

400
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:55,421
In this struggle,
all five of you must work together.

401
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:57,521
We must find Yun.

402
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,564
Without
the Manuscript of Legend...

403
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:04,298
we cannot def eat Komodo.

404
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,524
What are you thinking about?

405
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:26,116
Home.

406
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:29,027
I wonder if my mom and dad
are worried about me.

407
00:38:31,098 --> 00:38:33,658
What are your parents like?

408
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:37,329
I don't know.
No. They're pretty cool.

409
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,474
I mean, they're nice.

410
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:49,709
I wish I'd known
my mother and f ather.

411
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:58,618
They died just after
my brother and I were born.

412
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:02,695
Master Chung
looked after us.

413
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:07,031
Where is your brother?

414
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:10,896
He was recently killed.

415
00:39:12,507 --> 00:39:14,304
I'm sorry.

416
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,212
You must've been a great leader
in your world to be trusted...

417
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:23,682
with the Manuscript of Legend.

418
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:28,353
Not really.
I was just a bad f ollower.

419
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:32,188
- But I'd sure like to show them now.
- Show them what?

420
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:35,654
That I can run,
play f ootball...

421
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,664
just like everyone else!

422
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:42,665
What?

423
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:48,367
Nothing. I just think
I f ound a friend.

424
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,544
So have I.

425
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:53,807
Come on. There's something
I want to show you.

426
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,974
- What?
- Come on!

427
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:14,299
All this was built
in honor of the Rooz.

428
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:17,667
During the Old Order,
they were revered by everyone.

429
00:40:17,738 --> 00:40:21,139
- How come Yee doesn't talk?
- He used to.

430
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,199
But after the war
in Tao started...

431
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:26,269
he saw so much suff ering
that he hasn't spoken since.

432
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,549
Why'd Yun leave everyone?

433
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:35,118
- He killed someone in the battle.
- So what? It was a battle. People die.

434
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:37,248
It was a lif e!

435
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:43,696
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

436
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:50,134
It's just that the Warriors of Virtue
made a creed never to kill.

437
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:51,762
But Yun--

438
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,844
Someday you'll understand.

439
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:01,514
Understand what?

440
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:05,151
You remind me of my brother.
He's alway--

441
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:24,737
Let go of me!

442
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,975
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

443
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:32,979
- Move it.
- Help!

444
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,147
Help!

445
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:40,119
- Hey, Yun.
- Let go!

446
00:41:40,187 --> 00:41:42,348
Come to play?

447
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:44,357
Where's your sword?

448
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:46,359
You killed anyone today?

449
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:31,570
Mantose! Get up!

450
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,973
Barbra-Rotious, this way!

451
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:41,680
You're Yun, aren't you?

452
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,854
I'm Ryan, the Newcomer.

453
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:50,390
You saved me
at the river, remember?

454
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:54,485
Can I have the manuscript?
I need to bring it back to them.

455
00:42:54,562 --> 00:42:57,497
The Manuscript of Legend?

456
00:42:58,265 --> 00:43:01,234
You mean, you don't have it?

457
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,532
Then Komodo must have it.

458
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:08,573
You have to help them get it back.
Master Chung says they need you.

459
00:43:08,642 --> 00:43:11,475
Come on. Let's go.

460
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:13,604
You don't understand.

461
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:18,951
Where are you going?

462
00:43:22,156 --> 00:43:25,717
You're supposed to be
one of them!

463
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:28,785
Honor! Integrity! Remember?

464
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:33,860
You can't run away f orever!

465
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,767
No wonder they gave up on you.

466
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,273
Wimp!

467
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:46,505
Lai was right.
He doesn't care.

468
00:43:55,022 --> 00:43:57,490
- Let's go.
- Cool.

469
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:12,500
It can't be.

470
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:19,074
Irrational.

471
00:44:33,427 --> 00:44:34,519
Cool.

472
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:37,157
Thank you, Ryan.

473
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:39,732
Tsun, l--

474
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:47,606
I knew you'd return.

475
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:14,825
- Thanks.
- There was always wisdom in your heart.

476
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:17,336
Welcome home.

477
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:20,965
You should not have left.
Order has been disrupted.

478
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:25,239
I was wrong.
The Newcomer helped me realize that.

479
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:29,406
Come on.

480
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:40,455
It is good you've returned.

481
00:45:41,996 --> 00:45:43,361
Thank you.

482
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,596
Tell them about the manuscript.

483
00:45:50,004 --> 00:45:52,199
Komodo has it.

484
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:56,471
We will never stop Komodo now.
Its knowledge is his.

485
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:58,773
That's not so.

486
00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:05,946
It's good to see
all of you together again.

487
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,011
Forgive me.

488
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:11,683
The Newcomer brought
the manuscript.

489
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:16,458
He is the only one
with the eyes to see what is written.

490
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,760
Me?

491
00:46:18,832 --> 00:46:23,633
Master, on my lif e, I will
get the manuscript back from Komodo.

492
00:46:25,406 --> 00:46:27,374
Yun is back!

493
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:37,281
The Warriors of Virtue
are united again!

494
00:46:40,554 --> 00:46:42,488
Thank you, Ryan!

495
00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:15,546
My lord, all the zubrium has been mined
from this Lif espring.

496
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:17,817
The army stands at readiness.

497
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:22,260
The only question is,
what do we do since Yun has returned?

498
00:47:23,998 --> 00:47:26,660
Do not think thoughts.

499
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:32,032
The Rooz were born to die.

500
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,870
Even reunited,
they cannot def eat me.

501
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:39,242
Isn't that why they seek
the manuscript? Yes, it is.

502
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,372
- My lord, f orgive--
- Do not...

503
00:47:41,448 --> 00:47:43,313
think thoughts.

504
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:47,984
Outside, anxiety exists.

505
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:50,819
And where there is anxiety...

506
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,485
there is error.

507
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,494
And where there is error...

508
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:02,097
there is opportunity.

509
00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:03,602
They're panicking!

510
00:48:05,105 --> 00:48:08,268
Do not think thoughts!

511
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:12,567
Let them make their mistake.

512
00:48:12,646 --> 00:48:14,876
Forgive me, my lord...

513
00:48:14,948 --> 00:48:19,408
but if the manuscript can harm us,
why don't we just destroy it?

514
00:48:23,157 --> 00:48:25,625
It cannot be destroyed.

515
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:27,626
You can be destroyed.

516
00:48:27,694 --> 00:48:30,686
Your armies can be destroyed.

517
00:48:30,764 --> 00:48:34,757
But it cannot be destroyed!

518
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:39,029
Get out.

519
00:48:39,106 --> 00:48:41,040
Get away from me!

520
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:51,813
General Grillo.

521
00:48:56,657 --> 00:48:58,090
My lord?

522
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:03,763
Can I survive when I have destroyed
the last Lif espring in Tao?

523
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:12,639
And do you expect me to stay
in a world where I cannot survive?

524
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:14,640
No, my lord.

525
00:49:19,113 --> 00:49:21,047
Another world is waiting.

526
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:26,109
The manuscript...

527
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:30,646
will help us to get
to this other world.

528
00:49:30,724 --> 00:49:32,749
Then why do we need
the Newcomer?

529
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:37,286
Well, because he is
the teller of tales.

530
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:43,803
And I do not see f ailure
in your eyes.

531
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:49,469
The Newcomer
shall be yours, my lord.

532
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:50,976
General.

533
00:49:54,648 --> 00:49:56,081
Do--

534
00:49:57,718 --> 00:49:59,652
Does purple suit me?

535
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:04,489
Very much, my lord.

536
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:06,492
Then you are dismissed.

537
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,932
I don't like it. We should tell
Master Chung what we're doing.

538
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:18,995
- There's no time.
- Just listen to what she's saying.

539
00:50:19,072 --> 00:50:21,597
But Komodo can attack us
at any time.

540
00:50:21,675 --> 00:50:25,509
- He said to be patient.
- Patience is not my virtue.

541
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:28,946
If all of us go,
there will be chaos.

542
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:33,043
And I made a pledge to protect these
people. We can't leave them def enseless.

543
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:37,921
I let the manuscript f all
into Komodo's hands...

544
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:40,289
and I made a pledge
to Master Chung.

545
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,294
I will go myself.

546
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:47,790
- I'll go with you too.
- What about me?

547
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:50,530
Master Chung says I'm the only one
who can read the manuscript.

548
00:50:50,604 --> 00:50:52,834
That would be unwise.

549
00:51:01,348 --> 00:51:02,747
What did he say?

550
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:06,513
Yee said we must keep you from harm.
You're a friend.

551
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:13,993
Relax. It's just
a cool way to shake hands.

552
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,767
Okay. You're gettin' it.
You got it.

553
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,273
All right.

554
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:36,982
Good luck.

555
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:46,783
Thank you, Mosely.

556
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,294
Do I look like a baby-sitter?

557
00:51:49,363 --> 00:51:53,459
The next time, why don't you volunteer
to get us something to eat?

558
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:55,467
Your stupid ideas.

559
00:51:55,535 --> 00:51:58,470
If I hear one more thing
come out of your mouth--

560
00:52:01,141 --> 00:52:03,769
Your breath stinks.
Never mind.

561
00:52:20,327 --> 00:52:23,763
My lord,
Elysia is here.

562
00:52:44,851 --> 00:52:46,785
Your guilt is obscene.

563
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,124
It was a lif e!

564
00:52:57,431 --> 00:52:59,365
Yield to vengeance.

565
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:10,743
Medication time.

566
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:21,309
-The Newcomer has taken a liking to you.
-Yes.

567
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:23,322
And you care f or him.

568
00:53:25,926 --> 00:53:30,329
- He has f allen under my spell.
- A wicked spell it is.

569
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:34,492
What are you afraid of?

570
00:53:36,536 --> 00:53:39,164
- Not you.
- That's my girl.

571
00:53:56,056 --> 00:53:57,489
Oh, yes.

572
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:08,024
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

573
00:54:09,035 --> 00:54:13,267
That's Yun's sword.
Nobody touches Yun's sword.

574
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,174
Not even Yun, anymore.
Know what I mean?

575
00:54:17,244 --> 00:54:20,372
You again.
What do you want?

576
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:23,416
I've got a deal f or you, Newcomer.

577
00:54:23,483 --> 00:54:26,941
- I've got something you want.
- What?

578
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:33,185
I'm not telling
until I get something in return.

579
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,559
- Tell me now, partner.
- Take it easy. Whoa!

580
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:38,564
I'll tell you.

581
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:48,365
I've got the manuscript.

582
00:54:48,442 --> 00:54:50,501
You what?

583
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:54,613
Stole it right out
from under Komodo's nose.

584
00:54:56,616 --> 00:54:59,210
- Show it to me.
- Are you crazy?

585
00:54:59,286 --> 00:55:03,620
It's hid, hid where
no one's gonna find it but me.

586
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,954
But I'll take you there.

587
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:07,994
I have to tell them.

588
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:12,225
You're not listenin' to me.
The manuscript's not theirs.

589
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:14,062
It's yours.

590
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:18,400
Look, once they use up all the power,
how are you gonna get home?

591
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:20,599
You wanna stay here f orever?

592
00:55:20,674 --> 00:55:24,303
Never see your f amily, friends?

593
00:55:24,377 --> 00:55:25,844
Ever?

594
00:55:27,347 --> 00:55:29,281
Now, take it from me, Newcomer.

595
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:31,840
It's now or never.

596
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:39,020
No. Look, I can't leave them.
They need me here.

597
00:55:39,092 --> 00:55:40,753
Fine.

598
00:55:42,095 --> 00:55:45,326
You're not interested?
I'll ask someone else.

599
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:49,834
Mudlap.

600
00:55:51,204 --> 00:55:52,831
Wait.

601
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,475
A small reward f or my eff orts.

602
00:56:06,486 --> 00:56:08,420
It's a good watch.

603
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:18,627
Well, it's better than nothin'.
Come on.

604
00:56:41,421 --> 00:56:44,015
Hey, wait up!
Where are we?

605
00:56:46,993 --> 00:56:48,927
- Let go!
- Welcome to the other side.

606
00:56:48,995 --> 00:56:51,463
- Thanks, General Grillo.
- Jerk!

607
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:54,659
- Virtue be yours.
- Let go!

608
00:56:55,869 --> 00:56:59,999
Let go of my arm!
My arm, you punk! Let go!

609
00:57:10,684 --> 00:57:13,016
That is not your way.

610
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:16,920
Komodo's lies
have blinded your vision.

611
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:18,981
But the truth is still there.

612
00:57:21,828 --> 00:57:24,262
In your heart.

613
00:58:17,584 --> 00:58:19,313
The manuscript.

614
00:58:26,393 --> 00:58:28,327
It's too easy.

615
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:34,030
What? Hmm?

616
00:58:52,419 --> 00:58:55,547
Protectors of Tao,
weak...

617
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:57,852
vulnerable.

618
00:58:57,924 --> 00:59:00,552
What are you doing here?

619
00:59:02,462 --> 00:59:06,159
Oh, are you really
that surprised, Yun?

620
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:10,060
Virtue of Benevolence
who kills?

621
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:15,735
- It was an accident!
- Enjoy your restitution.

622
00:59:19,212 --> 00:59:21,772
Please, Elysia.

623
00:59:21,848 --> 00:59:25,147
Don't let him destroy
our Lif espring.

624
00:59:25,218 --> 00:59:28,051
I should have listened to Tsun.

625
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,293
Rooz!

626
00:59:43,636 --> 00:59:46,127
Thank you f or hanging around.

627
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,544
I have concocted a recipe...

628
00:59:56,616 --> 00:59:59,346
f or kangaroo stew.

629
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:01,080
First...

630
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:03,622
simply chop the meat
into many tiny little pieces...

631
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:06,853
and sprinkle with a hint
of benevolence.

632
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:08,018
Don't--

633
01:00:08,094 --> 01:00:11,723
Marinate in wisdom
f or many, many, many years.

634
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:13,823
Add just a touch...

635
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,993
of order!

636
01:00:17,604 --> 01:00:21,040
And let it simmer...

637
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:23,041
in righteousness.

638
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,044
Goes down very well with a...

639
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:28,046
nice cold vial of zubrium.

640
01:00:28,114 --> 01:00:29,274
My lord, please!

641
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:32,079
Growl. Roll over.

642
01:00:32,152 --> 01:00:34,279
- Beg!
- Please!

643
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,844
Go away.

644
01:00:41,628 --> 01:00:44,961
Komodo, you f orgot Ioyalty.

645
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:51,298
Loyalty...

646
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:53,635
only lasts so long.

647
01:00:53,706 --> 01:00:55,139
Then it spoils.

648
01:01:00,547 --> 01:01:02,481
Chi...

649
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:05,143
your stupidity astounds me.

650
01:01:05,218 --> 01:01:09,052
You come uninvited
into my lair...

651
01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:11,056
animals that you are.

652
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:15,754
Like animals, I shall
serve you up as supper...

653
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:19,094
to my close friend...

654
01:01:19,165 --> 01:01:21,998
and most honored guest...

655
01:01:22,068 --> 01:01:24,901
ladies and gentlemen...

656
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:26,404
the Newcomer!

657
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:28,770
No! Not Ryan!

658
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:35,175
It was Master Chung.

659
01:01:37,684 --> 01:01:39,276
Chung. Ah.

660
01:01:39,352 --> 01:01:42,515
- He took the Newcomer from me.
- We've got to get out of here.

661
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:46,548
I'll add just a dash
of old man to the dish.

662
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:50,084
And I'll enjoy your Lif espring
f or dessert!

663
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:53,299
Yes!

664
01:01:53,366 --> 01:01:54,924
General Grillo.

665
01:01:56,102 --> 01:01:57,194
Drink.

666
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:05,440
- Do it.
- Hmm?

667
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:06,773
Is it worth it, Grillo?

668
01:02:08,514 --> 01:02:10,141
General Grillo!

669
01:02:10,216 --> 01:02:14,209
You belong with us,
like it was when we were young.

670
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:16,847
You f orget, Yun.

671
01:02:16,923 --> 01:02:19,289
Even then we played
on opposite sides.

672
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,156
We were still friends.

673
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:22,455
Drop them!

674
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,334
Good boy, General!

675
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:42,777
Chi, give us some light here.

676
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,913
Uh-oh.

677
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:05,801
Don't anyone move.

678
01:03:28,528 --> 01:03:30,860
Yee, don't panic!

679
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,192
Oh, no.

680
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,000
Problem.

681
01:03:48,781 --> 01:03:51,477
Yee, the ring!

682
01:03:57,757 --> 01:04:00,351
Yee, is that a tunnel?

683
01:04:06,132 --> 01:04:07,326
Let's get out of here.

684
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:20,074
Forget the ring. Let's go!

685
01:04:25,318 --> 01:04:27,980
Don't panic.
We've got you!

686
01:04:28,054 --> 01:04:30,352
Ready, Chi? On three.

687
01:04:30,423 --> 01:04:32,948
One, two...

688
01:04:33,026 --> 01:04:34,288
three!

689
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,593
Go, go, go!

690
01:05:08,261 --> 01:05:10,320
Will the manuscript
really get me home?

691
01:05:10,396 --> 01:05:12,523
Yes, Ryan.

692
01:05:12,598 --> 01:05:14,623
By helping the Rooz...

693
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,066
you will find your way home.

694
01:05:17,136 --> 01:05:18,501
What about my leg?

695
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:22,735
What matters is not
what you gain there...

696
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,299
but in your heart.

697
01:05:24,377 --> 01:05:28,336
I want it to be strong,
like it is now.

698
01:05:28,414 --> 01:05:31,508
Do you consider
the Warriors of Virtue strong?

699
01:05:31,584 --> 01:05:34,280
Yeah. Look at them.

700
01:05:35,455 --> 01:05:39,016
Their strength
is not in what you see.

701
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:43,028
It is in their virtue.
That is their Kung.

702
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:45,324
What's Kung?

703
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:47,889
Kung is your energy...

704
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:50,299
your inner strength.

705
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:53,600
It can be positive or negative.

706
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:56,437
Those like Komodo
use negative Kung...

707
01:05:56,509 --> 01:05:59,137
to kill and destroy.

708
01:05:59,212 --> 01:06:03,740
But if you can bring your virtues
together within yourself...

709
01:06:03,816 --> 01:06:07,115
you will create positive Kung.

710
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:10,178
With that, you will always
have the power...

711
01:06:10,256 --> 01:06:12,121
to do the right thing.

712
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,787
If no one else can read the manuscript,
how will I be able to?

713
01:06:18,865 --> 01:06:21,959
The answer lies within you.

714
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:31,338
When I tell you to run,
take that path and go.

715
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:34,345
Do not stop until you get
to the Lif espring.

716
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,675
- Who's that?
- It's Komodo.

717
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:41,652
You should go now. Run!

718
01:06:41,721 --> 01:06:44,417
Where are you going, Newcomer?

719
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:48,810
Eat this, sucker!

720
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:34,095
Master Chung!

721
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:46,507
Come on!

722
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,877
Master Chung, help!

723
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:20,035
I ask you one last time.

724
01:09:22,114 --> 01:09:24,548
I am in hell.

725
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,253
It's my prison.

726
01:09:30,289 --> 01:09:33,224
How can I be free?

727
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:37,621
The only hells in this world...

728
01:09:37,697 --> 01:09:40,165
are in your heart...

729
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:44,134
where all the battles
must be f ought.

730
01:10:32,651 --> 01:10:33,709
Get out of here!

731
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:28,004
Are you all right?

732
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:34,877
There are too many of them. We must
leave. We've got to get out of here.

733
01:11:37,183 --> 01:11:40,346
Stupid Rooz!

734
01:11:55,568 --> 01:11:57,229
Oh, no.

735
01:12:01,874 --> 01:12:04,399
We shouldn't have left.

736
01:12:04,477 --> 01:12:07,275
There's no time f or blame, Chi.

737
01:12:07,346 --> 01:12:11,749
- We must find the others.
- There's only one place still saf e.

738
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:46,115
What are you doing here?

739
01:12:46,185 --> 01:12:48,210
Ryan, I wanted to tell you.

740
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:51,085
No, you're on his side.

741
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:54,353
- You're a traitor!
- No, Ryan.

742
01:12:54,426 --> 01:12:57,122
Listen to me, Ryan.
Let me explain.

743
01:12:57,196 --> 01:13:00,290
No. Master Chung is dead.
I saw him die.

744
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,630
How can you do this to them?
They protected you.

745
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:05,864
Protect with their creed
not to kill...

746
01:13:05,938 --> 01:13:07,303
ever?

747
01:13:07,373 --> 01:13:10,069
Well, they did kill.
Yun killed.

748
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:13,805
- It was one of the bad guys.
- It was my brother.

749
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:18,273
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

750
01:13:20,452 --> 01:13:22,386
It's over now.

751
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:26,288
Yun, the others,
they're dead.

752
01:13:26,358 --> 01:13:28,918
- Komodo killed them.
- Shut up!

753
01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:31,155
- Just shut up, Elysia!
- But it's okay f or you.

754
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:35,599
No, it's not. You set me up.
You said you were my friend.

755
01:13:35,668 --> 01:13:39,365
No, you get to go home, right?

756
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,906
Oh, Ryan, please, listen to me.

757
01:13:41,974 --> 01:13:44,101
Do what Komodo says.
I don't want you to get hurt.

758
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:47,270
Please? Listen--

759
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:52,346
Looking f or me?

760
01:14:02,027 --> 01:14:04,791
I know your sorrow.

761
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:08,195
I know...

762
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:10,201
your Ioneliness.

763
01:14:11,337 --> 01:14:14,135
Look at me!

764
01:14:15,441 --> 01:14:18,342
I am everything you can become.

765
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:20,776
I am...

766
01:14:20,846 --> 01:14:23,212
your darkest thoughts, Ryan.

767
01:14:23,282 --> 01:14:27,150
And I am proud
to be your destiny.

768
01:14:29,154 --> 01:14:31,714
No one will ever
laugh at you again.

769
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,917
I promise you that.

770
01:14:35,327 --> 01:14:37,352
Let's go home...

771
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:39,522
with your new leg.

772
01:14:39,598 --> 01:14:41,759
Ryan Jeff ers...

773
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:44,935
touchdown.

774
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:55,909
Open the book.

775
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:10,628
My lord.

776
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:13,995
The last Lif espring is now
completely under our control.

777
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:18,400
But the Rooz have escaped,
all of them.

778
01:15:19,605 --> 01:15:21,732
Go away.

779
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:23,741
Get out!

780
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:27,808
Read me the book.

781
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:33,613
What does it say?

782
01:15:45,097 --> 01:15:47,031
What does it say?

783
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:51,097
Do it, Ryan. Please.

784
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:53,195
Read it to me!

785
01:15:53,272 --> 01:15:55,240
Do it.
You'll get to go home.

786
01:16:00,813 --> 01:16:02,212
Read the words!

787
01:16:06,185 --> 01:16:07,743
Shit happens.

788
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:11,879
- Shit--
- Happens.

789
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:14,448
Shit happens.

790
01:16:30,075 --> 01:16:32,737
You can't read the book,
can you?

791
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,914
Can you?

792
01:16:38,317 --> 01:16:41,115
Komodo, please,
give him another chance.

793
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:45,786
You mean nothing to me!

794
01:17:01,907 --> 01:17:04,603
No one touches my master.

795
01:17:12,618 --> 01:17:15,610
I want him alive!

796
01:17:23,195 --> 01:17:26,289
Willy Beest! Mosely! Help!

797
01:17:50,088 --> 01:17:51,180
Hey, guys.

798
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:06,335
- All right.
- Virtue be yours!

799
01:18:34,032 --> 01:18:36,796
Good-bye, Master Chung.

800
01:19:07,332 --> 01:19:11,325
I don't want to see it anymore.
I don't want to be here.

801
01:19:11,403 --> 01:19:14,463
I don't want to see death.

802
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:16,473
I just want to go home.

803
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,644
Will this help?

804
01:19:21,747 --> 01:19:24,181
Get out of here, creep.

805
01:19:26,051 --> 01:19:29,452
Gee, come on, take it.
It'll make you f eel better.

806
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:32,422
Make me f eel better?
A watch?

807
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,083
Yeah, probably f or you.

808
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:36,787
All you care about is your stupid
little things and your rewards.

809
01:19:38,297 --> 01:19:42,859
You don't know what's important.
All you care about is how much you get.

810
01:19:42,935 --> 01:19:47,531
Just get out of here. You sold me out.
You sold yourself out. Go away.

811
01:19:47,606 --> 01:19:49,506
I just want to help.

812
01:19:49,574 --> 01:19:53,010
I don't need your help.
Get out of here, you two-f oot creep!

813
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:22,031
The Rooz need your help.

814
01:20:25,043 --> 01:20:28,137
They're at the Temple Ruin.

815
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:39,682
Search harder.

816
01:20:39,758 --> 01:20:42,522
- Leave no crevice unexplored.
- We've done that already.

817
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:44,858
- Just do it!
- Whatever.

818
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,234
General Grillo!

819
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:53,360
The manuscript.

820
01:20:53,438 --> 01:20:56,430
We have searched everywhere,
my lord, but--

821
01:20:56,508 --> 01:20:59,375
Then you have not looked
everywhere...

822
01:20:59,444 --> 01:21:00,934
have you?

823
01:21:01,013 --> 01:21:02,412
Find it.

824
01:21:02,481 --> 01:21:05,382
- Get out!
- Go!

825
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:20,964
I can't help you.

826
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:26,962
I tried to read it,
but it's empty.

827
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:29,303
There's nothing.
It's empty.

828
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:33,903
I'm sorry.
I tried to read it...

829
01:21:33,979 --> 01:21:36,311
but I can't.

830
01:21:40,318 --> 01:21:42,081
Yee's right.

831
01:21:42,154 --> 01:21:44,622
This is our home.

832
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:48,090
Live or die.

833
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,721
It's time, Yun.

834
01:21:57,369 --> 01:21:58,461
Why not?

835
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:21,618
You've come uninvited
into our Lif espring, Komodo.

836
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:24,628
This is our home.
We want it back.

837
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,663
Warriors...

838
01:22:30,735 --> 01:22:34,535
come out and play!

839
01:22:36,074 --> 01:22:37,166
What?

840
01:22:39,344 --> 01:22:41,039
Where is he?

841
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:50,020
Rooz!

842
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:01,557
Oh, no. Five.

843
01:23:32,364 --> 01:23:35,822
Still nothing to say?

844
01:23:35,901 --> 01:23:39,064
Then I will be your voice!

845
01:23:47,245 --> 01:23:49,270
Lai.

846
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:51,577
The center cannot hold.

847
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:54,881
Things f all apart.

848
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:32,320
You're just illusion, Komodo.

849
01:24:38,563 --> 01:24:39,894
Uh-oh.

850
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:22,437
Betrayal...

851
01:25:25,143 --> 01:25:27,873
is f ar more alluring, Tsun.

852
01:26:24,002 --> 01:26:27,165
How can I help the Rooz?

853
01:26:28,606 --> 01:26:32,064
The answer lies within you, Ryan.

854
01:26:35,613 --> 01:26:37,547
Master Chung?

855
01:26:38,983 --> 01:26:40,917
Help me.

856
01:26:42,887 --> 01:26:46,482
Five is one. Positive Kung.

857
01:26:46,558 --> 01:26:51,222
To take a lif e,
you lose a part of yourself.

858
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:05,976
He lost his power.

859
01:27:08,446 --> 01:27:10,744
That's it.

860
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:19,279
I am cruelty!

861
01:27:19,357 --> 01:27:21,587
Can you stop me, Yun?

862
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:30,160
Are you ready to kill again...

863
01:27:30,235 --> 01:27:32,635
Virtue of Benevolence?

864
01:28:23,955 --> 01:28:26,116
Eat this!

865
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:51,145
Yun, where is Komodo?

866
01:28:54,552 --> 01:28:57,146
What do we do now?

867
01:28:59,891 --> 01:29:01,324
Master?

868
01:29:07,131 --> 01:29:11,397
Yun, why didn't you
listen to me?

869
01:29:11,469 --> 01:29:13,869
You act in such haste.

870
01:29:16,307 --> 01:29:19,105
The Lif espring is gone.

871
01:29:19,177 --> 01:29:23,170
Master, I've f ailed you.

872
01:29:23,248 --> 01:29:26,740
Please, tell me what to do now.

873
01:29:26,818 --> 01:29:30,515
Now you can go to hell!

874
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,261
No, Yee. He'll break his neck.

875
01:29:38,329 --> 01:29:40,627
Hey, Komodo!

876
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:45,569
Looking f or this?
Remember me? I'm your friend.

877
01:29:45,637 --> 01:29:48,470
And I'm proud to be your destiny.

878
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:55,543
Chi, five is one! Positive Kung!
Do it now!

879
01:30:06,457 --> 01:30:08,482
The medallions!

880
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,152
- Water!
- Fire!

881
01:30:10,228 --> 01:30:12,594
- Wood!
- Earth!

882
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:07,717
- Is everyone all right?
- Yeah.

883
01:31:07,785 --> 01:31:09,218
Yee!

884
01:31:14,392 --> 01:31:15,825
Ryan.

885
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:28,833
- Did it work?
- Mm-hmm.

886
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:34,974
- It worked.
- What's this?

887
01:31:35,046 --> 01:31:37,947
I can read the manuscript.

888
01:31:39,584 --> 01:31:41,017
Chi.

889
01:31:47,525 --> 01:31:49,152
Five is one.

890
01:31:49,227 --> 01:31:51,092
Positive Kung.

891
01:31:51,162 --> 01:31:55,656
To take a lif e,
you lose a part of yourself.

892
01:31:55,733 --> 01:31:58,702
Ryan sacrificed himself
to save us.

893
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:01,466
Komodo expended his energy...

894
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:04,440
trying to kill Ryan
with negative Kung.

895
01:32:04,509 --> 01:32:06,272
It weakened him.

896
01:32:06,344 --> 01:32:08,278
You made the diff erence, Ryan.

897
01:32:08,346 --> 01:32:12,407
It gave us time to combine
our f orces to def eat him.

898
01:32:13,785 --> 01:32:15,377
Oh, no!

899
01:32:19,757 --> 01:32:22,351
General Grillo, it's over.

900
01:32:22,427 --> 01:32:24,554
Join us in peace.

901
01:32:28,599 --> 01:32:30,464
It's the only way.

902
01:32:31,469 --> 01:32:32,766
Excuse me?

903
01:32:36,474 --> 01:32:37,771
Excuse me.

904
01:32:39,644 --> 01:32:42,613
- I'm--
- Komodo?

905
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:46,912
I'm lost, and could someone
please tell me the way?

906
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:49,077
How do I get home?

907
01:32:51,289 --> 01:32:54,053
This is your home.

908
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:20,417
The Lif espring is alive!

909
01:33:23,121 --> 01:33:25,146
General?

910
01:33:25,223 --> 01:33:27,191
Release all the villagers.

911
01:33:51,015 --> 01:33:52,710
Thank you.

912
01:33:54,085 --> 01:33:56,019
Yee talked.

913
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:13,296
Ryan.

914
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:25,210
Are you in or out, Jeff ers?
Don't stand there like a dork!

915
01:34:25,283 --> 01:34:27,843
Ryan, he's just making fun of you.

916
01:34:27,919 --> 01:34:31,719
Man, this is stupid.
Let's make like Tom and "cruise."

917
01:34:34,325 --> 01:34:36,259
Why not?

918
01:34:38,796 --> 01:34:42,163
I can't believe it!
What are you doing?

919
01:34:42,233 --> 01:34:45,760
Finally. I'm glad
you came to your senses.

920
01:34:47,238 --> 01:34:50,435
We got a lot to talk about.
Let's get out of here.

921
01:34:50,508 --> 01:34:53,409
Jeff ers, you'll never make the cut!
Pansy ass!

922
01:34:53,477 --> 01:34:54,944
Shut up, Brad!

923
01:34:55,012 --> 01:34:56,502
Tracy, save it!

924
01:34:59,851 --> 01:35:01,512
Oh, my God.

925
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:07,182
Oh, my God!

926
01:35:08,793 --> 01:35:11,284
Get me out of here! Help!

927
01:35:11,362 --> 01:35:13,193
Quick!

928
01:35:13,264 --> 01:35:14,731
I don't know.

929
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:18,298
We've gotta help him.

930
01:35:18,369 --> 01:35:22,032
What are you looking at, you wussies?
Get me out of here!

931
01:35:22,106 --> 01:35:23,698
Swim hard, Brad.

932
01:35:25,176 --> 01:35:27,303
You think we ought to call 9-1-1?

933
01:35:27,378 --> 01:35:28,811
Definitely.

934
01:36:15,192 --> 01:36:17,456
How was your night?

935
01:36:17,528 --> 01:36:18,825
Virtuous.

936
01:36:20,598 --> 01:36:22,532
So how many houses did you sell?

937
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,764
Oh, at least 12.
We're set f or lif e.

938
01:36:26,837 --> 01:36:28,099
Good night, honey.

939
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,474
Good night.

940
01:36:36,113 --> 01:36:37,876
Mom?

941
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:41,311
I love you.

942
01:36:43,387 --> 01:36:44,854
I love you too.

943
01:37:17,555 --> 01:37:19,489
"Spread your wings."

944
01:37:31,135 --> 01:37:32,568
Shake.

945
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:39,632
Good boy, Bravo.

946
01:37:41,979 --> 01:37:45,312
Hey, Bravo, do you
want to hear about Tao?
