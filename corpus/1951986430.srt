00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:42,318
Siena, Italy

2
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,092
It's time to get out

3
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,554
Don't bleed to death

4
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,393
Hello Mitchell

5
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,644
Bond

6
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,397
The Americans are going to be
none too pleased about this.

7
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:50,566
I promised them Le Chiffre
and they got Le Chiffre.

8
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,151
They got his body.

9
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:54,737
If they'd wanted his soul they should
have made a deal with a priest.

10
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:57,573
Has he said anything?

11
00:07:57,656 --> 00:07:58,574
No.

12
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:00,242
Going to check the perimeter Ma'am.

13
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,121
You look like hell.

14
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,249
When was the last time you slept?

15
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,920
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,
the one who was abducted in Morocco

16
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:13,589
the one she was trying to save

17
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,501
His body was washed up on
a beach in Ibiza.

18
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:20,001
We're meant to believe the fish did
that to his face.
His wallet and ID were in his pocket

19
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,056
Well that's convenient.

20
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:22,090
Quite

21
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:26,227
Which is why I did a DNA check on
a lock of his hair found in Vesper's apartment.

22
00:08:26,644 --> 00:08:27,520
It's not him.

23
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:32,066
A lock of his hair?
I wouldn't have thought Vesper the sentimental type

24
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,611
Well we never really know anyone, do we?

25
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,864
But I do need to know Bond

26
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:42,076
I need to know that I can trust you.

27
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,601
And you don't?

28
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:47,501
Well it'd be a pretty cold bastard who didn't want revenge
for the death of someone he loved

29
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,460
You don't have to worry about me.

30
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,963
I'm not going to go chasing him.
He's not important.

31
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,467
And neither was she.

32
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:00,053
It's clear Ma'am.

33
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:01,513
Thanks Mitchell.

34
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:02,848
Shall we?

35
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:23,160
You going to tell us who you work for?

36
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:27,581
I was always very interested to meet you.

37
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,001
I'd heard so much about you from Vesper

38
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:35,422
In fact, the real shame is that,
if she hadn't killed herself, we would've had you too.

39
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:38,050
I think you would have done anything for her

40
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:42,004
Well you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

41
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:46,183
Which should tell you that eventually
you will tell us about the people you work with.

42
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,021
and the longer it takes,
the more painful we''ll make it.

43
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:57,028
You really don't know
anything about us.

44
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:03,644
It's so amusing because, we on the
other side, are thinking, oh...

45
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,663
the MI6, the CIA, they're looking over our shoulders,

46
00:10:05,788 --> 00:10:10,543
they're listening to our conversations,
and the truth is you don't even know we exist.

47
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:13,713
Oh we do now Mr White.
And we're quick learners

48
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,472
Well, then, the first thing you should know
about us is that we have people everywhere.

49
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:25,240
Am I right?

50
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,016
My God,
What barbarity!

51
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,396
Anything?

52
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:44,816
Craig Mitchell worked for me for 8 years.

53
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:48,362
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

54
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:51,490
And didn't leave so much as a scrap
of paper to explain any of it.

55
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:54,426
8 years,
5 as my personal bodyguard.

56
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,561
I found this,

57
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,001
and three other bloody Christmas
presents I bought him, about the house

58
00:15:58,514 --> 00:15:59,915
I don't think he smoked.

59
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:03,001
And you had to kill him!
You couldn't bring him in for questioning,

60
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,205
so we might actually learn something.

61
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,424
When someone says "We've got people everywhere",
you expect it to be hyperbole

62
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:09,910
Lots of people say that

63
00:16:10,443 --> 00:16:11,264
Florists use that expression.

64
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,932
Doesn't mean they've got someone working
for them inside the bloody room.

65
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,434
What the hell is this organization Bond?

66
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,145
How can they be everywhere and
we know nothing about them?

67
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,640
I assume we found no trace of White.

68
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:24,608
No.

69
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:29,011
The agent guarding the door in the garage
was dead before you passed him on the stairs.

70
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,530
I passed him on the stairs?
Christ!

71
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,699
Mitchell must have killed him when
he went out to check the perimeter.

72
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,618
You're lucky to be here.

73
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,069
You think White is still alive?

74
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,046
Yes I do.

75
00:16:38,371 --> 00:16:39,288
What is it?

76
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,208
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old,
no living family,

77
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,226
Gave generously to charity

78
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:45,944
Tell me that you know more than that.

79
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:48,047
Our money men went through every bill
in Mitchell's wallet and house

80
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:49,507
How much did he have?

81
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,450
Less than 100 pounds.

82
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,261
And about the same in euros and dollars.

83
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:54,637
Excuse me, excuse me madam.

84
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:57,924
We have done a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.

85
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,517
Not in the mood.

86
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:02,902
After you.

87
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:06,589
This particular note from Mitchell's
wallet might be of interest

88
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:10,468
We introduced tagged bills into Le Chiffre's
money laundering operation,

89
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:12,303
by intercepting illegal payoffs.

90
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,040
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world

91
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:16,625
That's pretty thin.

92
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:20,895
At the rate money changes hands,
you could probably find a tenner in my robe with a tag

93
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:25,066
That's true Ma'am, a single bill could be a
coincidence, but what about a whole stack?

94
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,570
These bills from the same series as Mitchell's

95
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,197
were just scanned at a bank in Port au Prince, Haiti

96
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:33,700
Deposited into the account of
a Mr Slate.

97
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,368
Impress me.

98
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,830
We have a Mr Edmund Slate, returning to
Port au Prince from Heathrow this morning.

99
00:17:39,747 --> 00:17:43,168
His entry documents have
him staying at Hotel Dessalines.

100
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:45,120
He's in room 325.

101
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,748
Thank you.

102
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:56,500
Your welcome.

103
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,757
Do you have any messages for 325?

104
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:13,096
No sir, the only message was about
the briefcase that was delivered earlier.

105
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,765
Did you want us to continue holding it?

106
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,308
No, I'll take that now.

107
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,684
Yes, sir.

108
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,397
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

109
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:30,491
Get in.

110
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:32,242
What?

111
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:33,619
Get in!

112
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,081
Fine.

113
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:41,627
You're late.

114
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,420
I got pulled into a meeting.

115
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:45,089
Who with?

116
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:47,174
A friend of Mr Whites.

117
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:50,302
I don't think I know him.

118
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:55,849
It's funny.

119
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,601
You don't look at all like I expected.

120
00:20:58,227 --> 00:20:59,186
Really?

121
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,521
What were you expecting?

122
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:03,148
I didn't think geologists looked so...

123
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:04,775
So?

124
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,071
Friend of yours?

125
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:10,823
I don't have any friends.

126
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:35,222
We didn't settle on a price.

127
00:21:35,347 --> 00:21:36,807
Make me an offer.

128
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:40,769
Or we could work it out later,
over drinks.

129
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:45,608
Dominic didn't give you any trouble did he?
No

130
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,574
What the hell is this?

131
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:55,326
I think someone wants to kill you.

132
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,751
That wasn't very nice.

133
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:08,548
You were supposed to shoot her.

134
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:10,008
Well I missed.

135
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,021
Get Bond.

136
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:25,773
Where is he now?

137
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:27,859
Approaching the docks.
Kings Quay

138
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,573
-Tanner?
- I've got Bond.

139
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:33,949
Ask him about Slate.

140
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:35,701
She wants to know about Slate.

141
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:37,703
Tell her Slate was a dead end.

142
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:39,038
Slate was a dead end.

143
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,372
Dammit, he killed him.

144
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:56,728
<i>Ya, mommie, es ist schrecklich heiss da
(Yes mommy, it's terribly hot there)</i>

145
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,992
Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

146
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:29,422
Camille.

147
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,342
How nice to see you.

148
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:34,427
Alive you mean?

149
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:39,432
I knew we shouldn't have
slept together.

150
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:41,643
I think I'm starting to like you.

151
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:44,020
So you did just try and have me killed?

152
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:49,567
And that made me very sad
thinking I would never see you again.

153
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:52,487
But here you are.

154
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:53,030
Dammit Dominic!

155
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,949
I was trying to help you!

156
00:23:57,743 --> 00:23:59,954
I was trying to uncover a leak.

157
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:02,873
And you, you send someone to kill me?

158
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:05,543
Please don't talk to me
like I am stupid!

159
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:09,213
It is unattractive.

160
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:13,884
Come, I want to show you something.

161
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,221
Come.

162
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:23,477
There is nothing that makes me more uncomfortable
than friends talking behind my back.

163
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,271
It feels like...

164
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:27,898
...ants under my skin.

165
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:30,276
It's been that way forever ...

166
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:33,487
I remember when I was 15.

167
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:36,657
I had a crush on one of my
mother's piano students.

168
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,451
Somehow,

169
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,997
I overheard her saying very
nasty things about me.

170
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,125
I got so angry,

171
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:49,169
I took a knife ...

172
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,049
Is that him?

173
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,595
I.. We only spoke on the phone.

174
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:03,225
It's such a shame because he's one
of my best geologists.

175
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:07,271
He said you asked to buy information.

176
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,859
He called me and offered to sell me information.

177
00:25:12,652 --> 00:25:15,572
Why would I come back here if I was lying?

178
00:25:16,823 --> 00:25:18,199
Because you love me.

179
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,951
I was doing it for you.

180
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,787
To stop him from betraying you

181
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:26,375
Do you know what burns more than
all your bullshit?

182
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,215
Is that I always got the feeling
you were only sleeping with me,

183
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:35,635
to get to General Medrano.

184
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:37,720
Is that him?

185
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,723
You know how these deposed dictators are.

186
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,185
Jealous of their safety.

187
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:46,979
Stick around.

188
00:25:48,064 --> 00:25:49,607
I'll introduce you.

189
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:53,986
You see the girl that just walked in here?

190
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,863
Would you give her that and tell her to call me.

191
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,262
You have reached Universal Exports,
Our offices are currently closed...

192
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:29,606
And you can do all this for me?

193
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,360
Well look at what we did to this country.

194
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,697
The Haitians elect a priest who decides to

195
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,699
raise the minimum wage from 38 cents
to 1 dollar a day.

196
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,954
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to upset the corporations,

197
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:47,207
who were here making teeshirts
and running shoes.

198
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:51,169
So they called us and we facilitated a change.

199
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:57,300
The difference is my country is not some
fly speck in the middle of the caribbean.

200
00:26:57,426 --> 00:27:00,470
But we have already begun
destabilizing the government.

201
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:02,973
We'll supply the private security.

202
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,225
We'll pay off the right officials

203
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,646
And we have 26 countries ready to
officially recognize your

204
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,566
new Bolivian government.

205
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:15,569
You want your country back.

206
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:19,322
My organization can give it
to you within the...week

207
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,076
You have been busy.

208
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:26,496
And in return,
You want what?

209
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,582
A desert.

210
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,340
This part.

211
00:27:36,465 --> 00:27:37,925
This land is worthless.

212
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:41,345
Oh, So you're getting a great deal?

213
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:43,431
You will not find oil there.

214
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,433
Everyone has tried.

215
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,185
Maybe.

216
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:48,978
Maybe not.

217
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,607
But we own whatever we find.

218
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:02,450
Do you know El Mr. Montes?

219
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,661
A very powerful man in his day.

220
00:28:05,661 --> 00:28:08,581
She had a beautiful Russian wife.

221
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:10,374
A dancer ...

222
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,294
Oh his daughter works for me

223
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:15,796
or did.

224
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:17,757
She's lovely.

225
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:20,551
But I don't see the resemblance.

226
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:24,555
Why don't you consider her
something to sweeten the deal?

227
00:28:27,475 --> 00:28:31,520
Just promise me to drop her over
the side when you're done.

228
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:36,108
Camille.
General Medrano.

229
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:53,085
Be careful what you wish for my dear.

230
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,346
Have fun you too.

231
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:23,695
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:24,529
You're welcome!

233
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:25,947
You idiot, take me back.

234
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:27,865
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

235
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:33,788
You're not one of Greene's?

236
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:40,795
Dominic Greene?

237
00:30:40,545 --> 00:30:41,713
Get down!

238
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:08,539
Give me the wheel!
Navigate!

239
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:21,260
Left!

240
00:31:28,343 --> 00:31:30,228
What are you doing?
Hold on!

241
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,072
Get down!

242
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:09,137
Excuse me.

243
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:10,405
Thank you.

244
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,282
She's seasick.

245
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:43,849
It's Bond.

246
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:45,600
Connect Bond.

247
00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:47,811
Yes?

248
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:52,691
Name check: Dominic Greene.
G-r-e-e-n-e

249
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:59,072
Might need a little more than that, there are a lot of
Dominic Greenes. So you have a social security or passport number?

250
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:00,323
No.

251
00:34:02,284 --> 00:34:03,535
Anything?

252
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:06,788
Do you have anything?

253
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,539
Will you put her on please.

254
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:08,957
I am on, Bond.

255
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:10,208
What happened to Slate?

256
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,836
I'm not dwelling on the past.
I don't think you should either.

257
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:13,962
You killed him.

258
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:16,881
Largest hit: Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

259
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:19,301
It's a utility company.

260
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:24,055
But Greene's been doing a lot of philanthropic work
buying up large tracts of land for ecological preserves

261
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:25,840
You should be getting his picture now

262
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:28,477
Yep, that's him

263
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm afraid there's a firewall around
his other corporate holdings

264
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:33,398
so we have no other information.

265
00:34:33,565 --> 00:34:35,150
Get me the Americans.

266
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:36,818
Connect.

267
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:37,986
Go ahead.

268
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,238
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

269
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:42,157
Transferring you now...

270
00:34:44,242 --> 00:34:45,577
Hold for Gregory Beam please.

271
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:50,190
Ah, hi, this is Gregory Beam, Ma'am.

272
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:51,100
Hello Mr. Beam.

273
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:54,921
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr Greene.

274
00:34:55,213 --> 00:34:57,464
<i>Thank you, Mr. Beam.
(Connection terminated)</i>

275
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,801
He's a person of extreme interest.

276
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:00,760
But he just said that he...

277
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:01,677
Tanner ..

278
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:05,097
I asked about the man and she transferred me
to the section chief of South America.

279
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:07,433
How would she know to do that if they
weren't tracking him?

280
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:14,724
Bond, we have your location
as approaching an airfield.

281
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:16,400
Is Greene on the move?.

282
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:20,321
Yeah, I've got a tail number
Golf Zero Charlie Sierra Charlie

283
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:22,114
Can you give me a destination.

284
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:29,413
It's a private charter, going to Bregenz,
Austria, leaving immediately.

285
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,292
Tanner, authorize a Charter for 007.

286
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:39,549
And Bond, if you could avoid killing every
possible lead, it would be deeply appreciated.

287
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:39,967
Yes ma'am.

288
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:42,868
<i>I will do my best.
(Connection terminated)</i>

289
00:35:43,637 --> 00:35:45,389
I've heard that before.

290
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:49,560
Hello.
- Hi.

291
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,228
Ah, welcome aboard

292
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:53,730
Bon jour, ca va?

293
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:56,358
Ca va, ca va.
Come, have a seat.

294
00:36:13,918 --> 00:36:15,670
Jeez.

295
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,171
Sorry.

296
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,260
How much longer?

297
00:36:25,054 --> 00:36:26,848
So do we have an understanding?

298
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:29,142
Ah, yeah.

299
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:33,730
We do nothing to stop a coup
in Bolivia and in exchange,

300
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:36,858
the new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

301
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:39,652
If its oil you want.

302
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,448
You didn't find diamonds, did ya?

303
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,041
Ah, drill it underground, it's kept off everyone's
radar for a very long time but

304
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:56,961
you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

305
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:00,298
We'll have to verify the find.

306
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:05,634
I am not even admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

307
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:09,307
Venezuela, Brazil and now Bolivia.

308
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:13,478
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America falling like dominoes.

309
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:19,901
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to the people do you?

310
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:23,822
No, we can hardly be expected to do
something about a coup we know nothing about

311
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,162
I have a... a pest

312
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:38,003
Do you have any idea who that is?

313
00:37:49,056 --> 00:37:50,307
Sorry.

314
00:37:52,392 --> 00:37:54,895
It's James Bond, British secret service.

315
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:58,941
Don't know how I could have missed that.

316
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:04,779
I will need for you to get rid of him for me.

317
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:05,322
Yeah.

318
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:06,199
That's not going to be a problem.

319
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:26,719
You know who Greene is, and you want to put
us in bed with him. You are kidding right?

320
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:29,889
Yeah, you're right.
We should just deal with nice people.

321
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:33,101
I need to know you're on the team, Felix.

322
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:35,812
I need to know you value your career.

323
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,575
Good to see you.

324
00:40:09,484 --> 00:40:10,193
Good.

325
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:11,486
Thank you.

326
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,410
How much more pipeline do we need?
(inaudible)

327
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,412
2000 kilometers

328
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:26,247
Are there any objections?

329
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:29,417
No.
Not here

330
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,586
No objections.

331
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:34,589
Transfer the funds from
our Siberian holdings

332
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,374
Done.

333
00:42:40,045 --> 00:42:42,130
Where do the Americans stand?

334
00:42:42,256 --> 00:42:46,218
The CIA doesn't care about another dictator
as long as they get their hand

335
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:49,012
But when they find out that
they've been duped?

336
00:42:49,137 --> 00:42:50,722
I'm working on that.

337
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,185
I'm still not sure that the Tierra project
is the best use of Quantum's time

338
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:57,980
Perhaps we should shift
our focus to the Canadian.

339
00:42:58,313 --> 00:43:00,816
This is the world's most
precious resource.

340
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:03,944
We need to control as
much of it as we can.

341
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:06,229
Bolivia must be top priority.

342
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:08,781
- Can I offer an opinion?

343
00:43:10,325 --> 00:43:14,162
I really think you people should
find a better place to meet.

344
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:21,878
Where do you think you're going?

345
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:44,818
Thank you.

346
00:43:55,537 --> 00:43:58,165
It seems that if you are everywhere.

347
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:13,783
Drop it!

348
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:19,330
So who are you working for?

349
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:20,998
Piss off!

350
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:25,169
Get rid of anything we brought with us.
We've been compromised.

351
00:45:28,031 --> 00:45:29,991
I asked you who you were working for.

352
00:45:42,629 --> 00:45:44,047
Is he one of ours?

353
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:44,423
No.

354
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:46,634
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

355
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:57,478
Get me M.

356
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:01,816
Fraulein ..

357
00:46:02,066 --> 00:46:03,818
Hents, connect call.

358
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:05,903
We've ID'd the pictures.

359
00:46:05,987 --> 00:46:07,488
Show me.

360
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:11,742
Gregor Karakov, former minister, now
owns most of the mines in Siberia.

361
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:16,064
Moeshi Saroff, former MOSSAD,
now telecomm giant

362
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:18,841
and Guy Haines,
special envoy to the prime minister.

363
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,501
Get Bond.

364
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:21,252
There's something else.

365
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,223
It appears Bond shot Haines' bodyguard
and threw him off a roof.

366
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:30,829
Where are you?

367
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,813
Did you get my pictures?

368
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:33,982
Was this a conversation?
Can you link these people?

369
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,450
Is that stress in your voice.

370
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,227
I need you to come in
and debrief

371
00:46:37,352 --> 00:46:38,270
I don't have time.

372
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,272
Bond, you killed a man
in Bregenz

373
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,107
I did my best not to.

374
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,694
You shot him at point blank and threw him off a roof.
I'd hardly call that "showing restraint".

375
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:48,196
Especially since he was
a member of special branch.

376
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:53,285
So who was he guarding?

377
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:55,579
Bond, are you missing the fact that you
killed a member of special branch.

378
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:57,664
I need you to come in.

379
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,124
And I would.

380
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:01,626
But right now I need to find the men
who tried to kill you.

381
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,378
Go back to sleep.

382
00:47:02,503 --> 00:47:03,629
<i>Connection terminated</i>

383
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,631
Restrict Bond's movements.

384
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:06,883
Cancel his cards.

385
00:47:07,216 --> 00:47:09,469
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them

386
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:11,554
And I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

387
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:12,638
Yes Ma'am.

388
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:13,639
And Tanner...

389
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,850
Be careful who you trust with this.

390
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:18,227
Hopefully you're a better
judge of character than I am.

391
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:22,681
You want to follow your friends
to La Paz, Bolivia?

392
00:47:22,815 --> 00:47:24,192
Please.

393
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:26,492
Abgelehnt=Rejected

394
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:28,362
Oh, I'm sorry sir, but this doesn't work.

395
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:29,822
Do you have another card?

396
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:31,282
No.

397
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:39,207
Could you do me a favor.

398
00:47:39,415 --> 00:47:41,417
You're going to get a phone
call in a minute.

399
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:43,920
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

400
00:47:44,837 --> 00:47:46,088
I'd be happy to.

401
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:47,256
Thank you.

402
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:54,222
Something Sky,
Guten Abend.

403
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,048
Mathis.

404
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:30,133
What do you want?

405
00:48:31,051 --> 00:48:32,636
You come to apologize?

406
00:48:35,138 --> 00:48:38,976
You know Mathis,
I think retirement suits you.

407
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:42,229
None for him.

408
00:48:42,562 --> 00:48:45,065
Sorry if he's in a bad mood today.

409
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:11,508
I need a passport and matching credit card.

410
00:49:12,175 --> 00:49:13,510
MI6 run out of plastic?

411
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:18,515
Well oddly right now you're the only
person I think I should trust.

412
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:20,183
That is odd.

413
00:49:20,684 --> 00:49:25,188
But I guess when one's young it seems very easy
to distinguish between right and wrong

414
00:49:25,522 --> 00:49:26,648
But as one gets older,

415
00:49:26,648 --> 00:49:29,860
it becomes more difficult.

416
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,279
The villains and the heros get all mixed up.

417
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:36,033
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

418
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:37,909
I think she loved you.

419
00:49:39,453 --> 00:49:41,872
Hmm, right up until the
moment she betrayed me.

420
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:43,291
She died for you.

421
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:47,545
Why did you really want to see me?

422
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:51,799
I need some information.

423
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,472
You have some hard friends.

424
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,391
This guy is some kind of facilitator.
Fingers in many pies.

425
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:02,894
And they don't leave any prints.

426
00:50:03,811 --> 00:50:05,563
These men were together?

427
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,774
They're buying up oil pipeline.

428
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:09,567
Something called
the "Tierra Project"

429
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:10,818
Do you know it?
Destroy these!

430
00:50:10,736 --> 00:50:13,205
That's Guy Haines.
You don't know him?

431
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:14,281
Should I?

432
00:50:14,406 --> 00:50:15,532
I suppose not.

433
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:18,327
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

434
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:22,623
He keeps a very low profile,

435
00:50:22,748 --> 00:50:24,416
but he is one of the
Prime Minister's closest advisers

436
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,085
They say you are judged by
the strength of you enemies

437
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,255
You know anything about Bolivia?

438
00:50:30,547 --> 00:50:33,258
I was stationed in South America for 7 years.

439
00:50:34,176 --> 00:50:35,260
Well do you have some contacts there?

440
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:36,678
A few.

441
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:38,472
What do you want to know?

442
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:41,391
Come with me.

443
00:51:13,215 --> 00:51:14,633
You can't sleep?

444
00:51:14,592 --> 00:51:16,052
May I fix you a drink, sir?

445
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:21,557
What are you drinking?
I dunno, what am I drinking?

446
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:24,894
3 measures of Gordon's Gin
one of vodka, half a measure of ..

447
00:51:25,645 --> 00:51:27,814
Kina Ole, which is not very vermouth.

448
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:30,650
Shaken well until it is ice cold,

449
00:51:30,858 --> 00:51:32,402
and served with a large thin slice of lemon peel

450
00:51:33,903 --> 00:51:34,904
Six of them.

451
00:51:34,863 --> 00:51:35,906
That's impressive.

452
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:37,908
They're good, you should have one.

453
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:41,829
Or it'll just keep me awake.

454
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,793
So what's keeping you awake?

455
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:53,215
I was wondering why
you came with me.

456
00:51:55,509 --> 00:51:58,345
It takes something to admit you were wrong.

457
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,225
You want a sleeping pill?

458
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,351
No.

459
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:05,602
Pain pills?

460
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,230
I have pills for everything.

461
00:52:08,856 --> 00:52:10,858
Some make you taller

462
00:52:11,984 --> 00:52:13,652
Some make you forget

463
00:52:17,406 --> 00:52:19,491
I am going to try and get some sleep.

464
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:20,743
Good idea.

465
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,718
Thank you.

466
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,288
Mr Bond, my name is
Fields, I am from the consulate.

467
00:52:40,997 --> 00:52:43,291
Well of course you are.
What do you do at the consulate, Fields?

468
00:52:43,499 --> 00:52:47,845
That is not important. My orders are to turn you around
and put you on the first plane back to London.

469
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:50,465
Do those orders include my friend Mathis?

470
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:52,884
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

471
00:52:52,217 --> 00:52:55,587
You see that?
Gone such a short time and already forgotten.

472
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:57,806
Ahh, you're just saying that to hurt me.

473
00:52:58,223 --> 00:53:00,942
Mr Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

474
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:01,876
Taxi.

475
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,611
Fields.

476
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:04,670
When is the next
flight to London?

477
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:05,222
Tomorrow morning.

478
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:06,698
Well then, we have all night.

479
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:11,369
If you try to flee, I will arrest you,
drop you off in gaol and take you to the plane in chains. Understand?

480
00:53:11,578 --> 00:53:13,238
Perfectly, after you.

481
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,991
I think she has handcuffs.

482
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:18,176
I do hope so.

483
00:53:25,459 --> 00:53:27,669
He blames the water shortage on global warming.

484
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,597
The colonel, who heads the national police

485
00:54:03,538 --> 00:54:04,957
We have a reservation.

486
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:08,093
Very well thank you.

487
00:54:08,218 --> 00:54:09,052
Your name?

488
00:54:09,178 --> 00:54:10,712
Miss Fields.

489
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,468
Not going anywhere

490
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:18,637
So shoot me,
I'd rather stay in a morgue.

491
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,556
We are teachers on sabbatical.
This fits our cover.

492
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,641
No it doesn't. Get in.

493
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:24,310
Get in!

494
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:51,538
Follow me please.

495
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:00,814
May I show you your room, Signor?

496
00:55:00,939 --> 00:55:02,282
No, it's fine, thank you.
Gracias

497
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:24,721
I can't find the, umm...
..the stationery.

498
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:27,015
Come and help me look

499
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,824
You've been invited to a party.

500
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,493
I didn't know we had any friends here.

501
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:48,329
Green Planet.

502
00:55:50,206 --> 00:55:51,165
You're not coming?

503
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:53,534
I'm having a drink with my friend,
the Colonel.

504
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:55,194
I'll see you there later.

505
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,427
Do you know how angry I am at myself?

506
00:56:04,512 --> 00:56:06,180
I can't imagine

507
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,935
You must be furious.

508
00:56:17,317 --> 00:56:18,860
Do you want to go to a party?

509
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:21,279
Party?

510
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,115
But I have nothing to wear

511
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:25,950
We'll fix that

512
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:47,889
It might be useful to know your real name.

513
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:53,478
Fields,
Just Fields.

514
00:56:54,563 --> 00:56:56,239
Fields it is.

515
00:56:56,808 --> 00:57:00,902
We are in a spiral of environmental decline.

516
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:04,073
Since 1945,

517
00:57:04,606 --> 00:57:10,311
17% of the planet's vegetated surface
has been irreversibly degraded.

518
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,851
The Tierra project is just one small
part of a global network, of equal parts

519
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:21,773
that Green Planet has created,
to rejuvenate the world

520
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,375
on the verge of collapse.

521
00:57:24,918 --> 00:57:29,298
I hope that tonight, you make the
decision to be part of that.

522
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:32,468
Thank you.

523
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:38,307
And have fun.

524
00:57:42,061 --> 00:57:43,896
Excellent speech. Congratulations.

525
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:45,815
Wonderful speech Dominic

526
00:57:46,398 --> 00:57:47,566
Thank you.

527
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,069
Miss Fields, Mr Bond,

528
00:57:50,277 --> 00:57:51,529
my friend Carlos

529
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:52,780
Pleased to meet you.

530
00:57:52,988 --> 00:57:54,031
Ma'am.

531
00:57:54,657 --> 00:57:57,660
Mr Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

532
00:57:58,327 --> 00:58:00,429
I want you to know my
entire police force

533
00:58:00,513 --> 00:58:01,681
is at your disposal

534
00:58:01,764 --> 00:58:03,349
Well, that could be very useful.

535
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,937
You know, there are people in this country spending
half their paycheck just to get clean water.

536
00:58:08,229 --> 00:58:09,480
What do you think of that?

537
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:12,108
The Bolivian government is the problem

538
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:15,862
They cut down the trees, then act surprised
when the water and the soil

539
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:17,222
wash out to sea

540
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:18,365
I couldn't agree more.

541
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,559
I hope this figure is to your liking

542
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,618
Chere, you shouldn't tease

543
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,823
Why don't you tell them about all the land
you bought up outside the city?

544
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:28,475
It's been a pleasure.

545
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,926
Would you excuse me?

546
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,865
Somehow the logging rights went to a multinational
corporation, that cut down the forests

547
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:40,687
But only after our last government sold the land
to Green Planet.

548
00:58:43,098 --> 00:58:46,310
Or have I got my facts crossed?
Yes, I think you did.

549
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:48,645
Will you excuse us?

550
00:58:50,188 --> 00:58:51,648
What a wonderful night, Signori.

551
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,988
You just cost me quite a bit of money darling.

552
00:58:58,113 --> 00:59:00,407
You cann't put a price
on integrity.

553
00:59:01,158 --> 00:59:02,409
I can try.

554
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:13,420
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight just
to piss on my parade

555
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:16,891
Why are you still after this general's head?
For your mantel?

556
00:59:17,141 --> 00:59:18,476
A little of both.

557
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:24,889
Tell me where Medrano is, and maybe you
won't lose any more investors

558
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:31,489
You are really breaking my heart choosing
an insect like that over me.

559
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,076
You going to throw me over?

560
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,412
Well, you've been drinking.
Maybe you slipped?

561
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:41,499
Ohh, just think how much you'd miss me

562
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:47,906
Good evening.

563
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:49,574
There you are.

564
00:59:51,993 --> 00:59:53,244
Would you excuse me?

565
00:59:54,162 --> 00:59:55,205
Mr Bond.

566
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:57,832
What a pleasure.

567
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,346
Careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you

568
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:05,507
unless you give her something she really wants.

569
01:00:05,757 --> 01:00:10,095
It is a shame, because she is really quite stunning
once you get her on her back

570
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:13,431
I wish I could say that
the feeling was mutual.

571
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:15,317
I'm sorry Mr Greene,
but we have to go.

572
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:17,185
Please, my friends call me Dominic.

573
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,770
I'm sure they do

574
01:00:20,105 --> 01:00:23,691
How much do you know about Bond, Camille,
because he's rather a tragic case

575
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:27,028
His MI6 says that he's
difficult to control.

576
01:00:27,445 --> 01:00:32,642
Nice way of saying that everything he touches
seems to wither and die.

577
01:00:32,851 --> 01:00:34,010
Shall we?

578
01:00:34,236 --> 01:00:37,038
Doesn't bode well for you, I'm afraid.

579
01:00:37,038 --> 01:00:39,207
You two do make a charming couple though.

580
01:00:39,415 --> 01:00:41,509
You're both... What's the expression?

581
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:44,295
Damaged goods.

582
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,216
Oh my Gosh!

583
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:50,719
I'm so sorry.

584
01:00:54,556 --> 01:00:56,308
Come on, lighten up.
You're crampin' my style.

585
01:00:58,644 --> 01:01:02,181
So it's British intelligence now?
What the hell do you want from me?

586
01:01:02,406 --> 01:01:04,492
You're going to show me
Dominic Greene's Tierra Project.

587
01:01:04,784 --> 01:01:06,786
Are you up to it?
- Do I have choice?

588
01:01:07,203 --> 01:01:08,120
Do you want one?

589
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,457
There is something horribly
efficient about you.

590
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:13,125
What a compliment.

591
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,476
What's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?

592
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,132
Stay here

593
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,632
Good Evening

594
01:02:04,695 --> 01:02:06,697
(Now why would you want me to do that?)

595
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:40,689
Mathis

596
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,069
There is a hospital on
the other side of town.

597
01:02:46,403 --> 01:02:49,656
Please,
Stay with me

598
01:02:50,908 --> 01:02:52,493
Stay here please

599
01:02:52,785 --> 01:02:54,328
Please

600
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:55,330
Come here

601
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:00,960
OK

602
01:03:02,504 --> 01:03:04,088
That's better

603
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:06,257
That does not hurt

604
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:11,179
Is Mathis your cover name?

605
01:03:12,764 --> 01:03:13,890
Yes

606
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:17,644
Not a very good one, is it?

607
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,611
Do we forgive each other?

608
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:30,782
I shouldn't have left you alone.

609
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:34,327
Vesper

610
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:37,247
She did everything for you

611
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,026
Forgive her

612
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:44,780
Forgive yourself

613
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:08,553
Is that how you treat your friends?

614
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:10,974
He wouldn't care

615
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:18,731
Let's go

616
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:35,581
The Foreign Secretary is asking to see you

617
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,418
What don't I know?

618
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:40,920
Rene Mathis has been
shot dead in Bolivia

619
01:04:41,546 --> 01:04:43,631
The police claim it was Bond.

620
01:05:18,408 --> 01:05:19,660
How much did you pay him?

621
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:21,203
Well, he wanted you.

622
01:05:21,328 --> 01:05:23,580
But I left him the car as collateral.

623
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,666
He'll make much more when he sells us out.

624
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:31,922
Right .. let's see if this thing will fly.

625
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:53,026
Here. All the information I have found
says there was nothing of any there.

626
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,096
But Greene's geologists have
proved that there was.

627
01:05:59,683 --> 01:06:02,603
My sources tell me that you
are Bolivian secret service.

628
01:06:04,188 --> 01:06:05,648
Or used to be.

629
01:06:06,607 --> 01:06:10,444
Not that you infiltrated Greene's
organization by having sex with him.

630
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:12,112
That offends you?

631
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:13,781
No, not in the slightest.

632
01:06:14,698 --> 01:06:16,367
So what is your interest in Greene?

633
01:06:16,784 --> 01:06:19,203
Well amongst other things, he
tried to kill a friend of mine.

634
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,288
A woman?

635
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,582
Yes, but it's not what you think.

636
01:06:23,324 --> 01:06:24,325
Your mother?

637
01:06:24,576 --> 01:06:25,910
She likes to think so.

638
01:06:29,998 --> 01:06:31,416
What's that, down there?

639
01:06:34,669 --> 01:06:37,922
That's a sink hole.
There are a few around here

640
01:06:39,758 --> 01:06:42,260
Just for the record, I wasn't
with Greene for a ...

641
01:07:49,761 --> 01:07:51,096
I think we lost him

642
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:02,482
He's coming fast.

643
01:08:49,139 --> 01:08:50,515
He's right behind you!

644
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:35,560
Here!
Put that on!

645
01:10:19,831 --> 01:10:21,690
Come on!

646
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,338
Come here!

647
01:11:02,741 --> 01:11:08,162
According to Bolivians it was a routine
stop and when they discovered Mathis's body,
Bond disarmed and shot them.

648
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,000
Of course there are no witnesses
to prove otherwise.

649
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,919
I need something.
I can't go in there unarmed.

650
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,337
I'm sorry, there's nothing.

651
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,425
Come in.

652
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,596
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

653
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,190
No Minister.

654
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,609
I don't think I need to tell you
how upset the P.M. is.

655
01:11:28,526 --> 01:11:30,737
With respect, the P.M. has
my direct line.

656
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:32,989
And he'd have used it if he'd
wanted to speak to you

657
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:40,330
I'm sorry M. Things have changed.
We've had long discussions with our cousins

658
01:11:40,705 --> 01:11:43,249
Mr Greene's interests and ours
now align.

659
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:47,921
Minister, this man is a major player in one
of the most dangerous and powerful organizations...

660
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:49,823
...we've never even heard of.

661
01:11:50,048 --> 01:11:53,343
Foreign policy cannot be conducted on the
basis of hunches and inuendo

662
01:11:53,426 --> 01:11:57,180
Then give us time to gather enough evidence
so you can make informed decisions.

663
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,182
Fine.

664
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:05,929
Say you're right, say Greene is a villain.
If we refused to do business with villains
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

665
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:11,712
The world is running out of oil M.
The Russians aren't playing ball,

666
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:13,183
the Americans and Chinese are
dividing up what's left.

667
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:18,518
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.
We're acting out of necessity.

668
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:26,943
Bond is running wild.
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

669
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:29,029
Pull him in.

670
01:12:29,863 --> 01:12:32,449
Or the Americans will put him down.

671
01:12:35,077 --> 01:12:36,870
I think I've found a way out.

672
01:12:37,288 --> 01:12:38,998
You're freezing

673
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,084
I'm fine.

674
01:12:58,267 --> 01:13:00,144
So what is it that Greene
has that you want?

675
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,279
It's not Greene, it's Medrano,
the man you met in Haiti.

676
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:16,744
My father worked for the military junta.
He was a very cruel man.

677
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:20,207
But he was my father.

678
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:29,091
When I was a small child, the opposition
sent General Medrano to our house.

679
01:13:32,010 --> 01:13:36,974
He shot my father.
He did things to my mother and my sister,

680
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:42,729
and then strangled them while I watched

681
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:46,483
I was too young to be any trouble.

682
01:13:47,734 --> 01:13:50,112
So he just smiled at me

683
01:13:52,197 --> 01:13:54,408
and set the house on fire.

684
01:13:57,244 --> 01:13:59,329
He left his mark.

685
01:14:02,749 --> 01:14:04,626
So when I pulled you off the boat...

686
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:07,337
I waited years for that chance.

687
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,048
I apologize.

688
01:14:11,926 --> 01:14:14,470
Seems we're both using
Greene to get to somebody

689
01:14:16,305 --> 01:14:18,516
You lost somebody?

690
01:14:19,058 --> 01:14:20,810
I did, yes.

691
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,521
You catch whoever did it?

692
01:14:24,146 --> 01:14:26,440
No, not yet.

693
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,652
Tell me when you do

694
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,696
I'd like to know how it feels

695
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:39,161
We should go.

696
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:41,455
You ready?

697
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,616
They've used dynamite.

698
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,830
This used to be a river bed.

699
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:42,475
Greene isn't after the oil,
he wants the water.

700
01:15:44,094 --> 01:15:45,662
We can't leave it like this.

701
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:47,006
It's one dam.

702
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:50,233
He's creating a drought.
And he'll build others.

703
01:17:19,441 --> 01:17:21,777
Excuse me sir. Your
wife left a message.

704
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:23,955
The English woman. She left
it for you this morning

705
01:17:24,497 --> 01:17:25,123
Thank you.

706
01:17:25,331 --> 01:17:26,249
My pleasure.

707
01:17:26,499 --> 01:17:27,834
Run!

708
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:29,710
What is it?

709
01:17:31,504 --> 01:17:33,047
Would you mind waiting down here?

710
01:17:33,798 --> 01:17:35,675
I'll be outside.

711
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:56,529
So that's what she meant?

712
01:17:57,364 --> 01:17:59,032
I hope you can trust
these men

713
01:17:59,032 --> 01:18:00,917
Just a moment.
It's Tanner

714
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,120
Yes?

715
01:18:04,663 --> 01:18:08,416
We've got the girl downstairs. She says to tell
you she's sorry but this is not her fight

716
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:09,959
It isn't. Let her go.

717
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,628
She isn't our concern.

718
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,047
I'm disappointed

719
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,466
You are?

720
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:18,635
How much oil did the Americans promise you?

721
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:20,720
This isn't about oil.
Well that's good because there isn't any.

722
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:22,197
It's about trust.

723
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,574
You said you weren't motivated by revenge

724
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,493
I'm motivated by my duty.

725
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:27,619
No.

726
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:31,990
I think you are so blinded by inconsolable
rage that you don't care who you hurt.

727
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,870
When you can't tell your friends from
your enemies it's time to go.

728
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,056
You might like to still hold your
theory about there being no oil

729
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,350
Her lungs are full of it

730
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,270
It was Greene.

731
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,813
No doubt. But Why?

732
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,232
It's just misdirection...

733
01:18:57,357 --> 01:18:58,900
I mean, why her Bond?

734
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:04,197
She was just supposed to send you home.
She worked in an office. Collecting reports

735
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:08,368
Look how well your charm works, James

736
01:19:08,618 --> 01:19:14,332
They'll do anything for you, won't they?
How many is that now?

737
01:19:13,841 --> 01:19:16,969
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

738
01:19:17,195 --> 01:19:20,323
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to have these men and leave with them now.

739
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:09,039
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

740
01:20:09,147 --> 01:20:10,899
I want that mentioned in your report.

741
01:20:11,441 --> 01:20:12,984
Now you and I need to see this through.

742
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:14,569
There's nowhere to go.

743
01:20:14,778 --> 01:20:16,655
<i>There's a capture or kill order out on you.</i>

744
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,366
Who would have done that?

745
01:20:29,601 --> 01:20:31,253
Ma'am?
Find out where he's going.

746
01:20:31,453 --> 01:20:32,220
He's on to something.

747
01:20:31,904 --> 01:20:33,172
Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

748
01:20:33,255 --> 01:20:35,549
I don't give a shit about the CIA,
or their trumped up evidence.

749
01:20:35,758 --> 01:20:37,843
He is my agent.
And I trust him.

750
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:39,178
Go on.

751
01:20:50,681 --> 01:20:51,515
Get in.

752
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:53,476
Are you going to try and shoot me?

753
01:20:53,601 --> 01:20:54,977
I said, get in.

754
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:12,661
You're getting impossible if you
keep drinking that (?)

755
01:21:12,995 --> 01:21:14,997
It's bottled water.

756
01:21:15,915 --> 01:21:20,586
It probably came from some stream just around the
corner from here, bunch of little kids peeing in it.

757
01:21:22,463 --> 01:21:24,548
That's why I eat the peppers.

758
01:21:23,548 --> 01:21:25,550
Well, all I'm saying is ...

759
01:21:25,842 --> 01:21:28,345
<i>You can not trust a damned thing around here.
(phone rings)</i>

760
01:21:34,935 --> 01:21:37,229
You know, you should just answer "C.I.A." Felix.

761
01:21:37,354 --> 01:21:39,856
The taxi driver told me
where the office was

762
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:42,526
Well, if it was so easy to find, James,

763
01:21:42,526 --> 01:21:44,319
you should come visit.

764
01:21:45,362 --> 01:21:47,781
Or maybe you should come out and see
some more of the city.

765
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,304
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.

766
01:22:11,429 --> 01:22:12,889
Felix.

767
01:22:17,428 --> 01:22:21,474
You know, I was just wondering what South America would
look like if nobody gave a damn about coke or communism

768
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:24,268
It's always impressed me the way you
boys have carved this place up

769
01:22:24,518 --> 01:22:26,604
I'll take that as a compliment coming a Brit.

770
01:22:29,273 --> 01:22:31,192
You sure you're playing
with the right side?

771
01:22:32,193 --> 01:22:36,363
Regimes change once a week down here.
Medrano will be no dirtier than the next guy.

772
01:22:36,489 --> 01:22:38,991
Oh you see, that's what I like about U.S. intelligence:
you'll lie down with anybody.

773
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:40,467
Including you brother.

774
01:22:40,517 --> 01:22:41,794
Including you.

775
01:22:42,745 --> 01:22:44,538
Do you know you're being played?

776
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:49,918
Dominic Greene is going to suck this place dry
and then he's going to move on and you're going to be
left picking up the broken crockery

777
01:22:50,036 --> 01:22:51,012
What can I tell you...

778
01:22:51,137 --> 01:22:52,680
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

779
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,683
You see Felix, I do not think you're
half as cynical as you make out to be.

780
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,185
You don't know me.

781
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:00,939
Why?

782
01:23:01,105 --> 01:23:02,607
Just because you didn't come alone?

783
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:04,692
How long have I got?

784
01:23:04,859 --> 01:23:06,236
30 seconds.

785
01:23:08,029 --> 01:23:09,572
Well that doesn't give us a lot of time,
does it?

786
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:15,411
Medrano can't move until he's paid off
the army and the police chief

787
01:23:15,703 --> 01:23:22,418
Greene is bringing him his money now at the hotel
called La Perla dellas Dunas, in the desert.

788
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:23,878
Thank you Felix.

789
01:23:24,295 --> 01:23:25,088
James.

790
01:23:24,613 --> 01:23:25,530
Move your ass!

791
01:23:51,724 --> 01:23:52,892
What the hell happened?

792
01:23:52,975 --> 01:23:54,226
What did you tell him?

793
01:23:54,226 --> 01:23:55,895
Just what we agreed.

794
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:20,856
What are you doing?

795
01:25:23,693 --> 01:25:24,819
This guy has guns.

796
01:25:26,404 --> 01:25:28,072
Maybe you should check your own.

797
01:25:28,906 --> 01:25:30,074
I will.

798
01:25:35,246 --> 01:25:37,231
Have you ever killed someone?

799
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:44,530
The training will tell you that when the
adrenalin kicks in, you should compensate.

800
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:49,760
But a part of you is not going to believe the
training because this kill is personal.

801
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:54,015
Take a deep breath.

802
01:25:54,223 --> 01:25:55,933
You only need one shot.

803
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:57,868
Make it count.

804
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,008
In Euros.
As requested.

805
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:11,093
The Dollar isn't what it once was

806
01:27:11,385 --> 01:27:12,970
The cost of war

807
01:27:15,264 --> 01:27:19,384
But I am afraid that the corruption in this
current Government can no longer be tolerated

808
01:27:22,522 --> 01:27:23,898
And mine?

809
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:26,692
Waiting until you sign over my land

810
01:27:43,376 --> 01:27:45,294
My first official act

811
01:27:51,217 --> 01:27:52,385
And this, if you would

812
01:27:53,302 --> 01:27:54,679
What is this?

813
01:27:54,887 --> 01:27:57,642
As of this moment, my organization owns

814
01:27:57,767 --> 01:28:01,310
more than 60% of Bolivia's water supply

815
01:28:01,435 --> 01:28:04,563
So this contract states that your new government

816
01:28:04,897 --> 01:28:08,234
will use us as utilities provider

817
01:28:08,818 --> 01:28:11,445
This is double what we are paying now

818
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:17,076
Ah well then, don't sign it!

819
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:23,332
But you should know something about me and
the people I work with.

820
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:29,505
We deal with the left or the right,
with dictators or deparitos (?)

821
01:28:30,331 --> 01:28:35,344
If the current president had been more agreeable,
I wouldn't be talking to you

822
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:43,144
So if you decide not to sign, you will wake up with your balls
in your mouth and your willing replacement standing over you

823
01:28:45,555 --> 01:28:51,185
If you doubt that then shoot me, take that
money, and have a good night's sleep.

824
01:29:50,622 --> 01:29:52,956
You and I had a mutual friend

825
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:45,550
Sounds like you just lost another one

826
01:33:55,621 --> 01:33:59,909
Not this way, not this way!
Can't. I can't

827
01:34:18,477 --> 01:34:20,062
Make your shot

828
01:34:19,829 --> 01:34:21,714
Take a deep breath

829
01:34:22,999 --> 01:34:24,817
Make it count

830
01:34:40,725 --> 01:34:41,934
Come on!

831
01:34:56,867 --> 01:34:58,451
Wait here

832
01:35:29,441 --> 01:35:31,402
You promised that you...

833
01:35:31,402 --> 01:35:32,778
...let you go?

834
01:35:33,487 --> 01:35:35,697
I answered your questions.

835
01:35:36,532 --> 01:35:39,159
I told you what you wanted to know about Quantum.

836
01:35:39,326 --> 01:35:40,494
Yes you did.

837
01:35:40,711 --> 01:35:43,964
And your friends would know that,
so they'dd probably be looking for you.

838
01:35:44,131 --> 01:35:45,382
But the good news is ...

839
01:35:45,507 --> 01:35:47,051
you're in the middle of the desert.

840
01:35:51,555 --> 01:35:52,598
Here

841
01:35:54,558 --> 01:35:57,895
I bet you make it 20 miles
before you consider drinking that

842
01:35:58,312 --> 01:35:59,980
Goodbye Mr Greene.

843
01:36:00,397 --> 01:36:03,317
(auto oil)

844
01:36:40,089 --> 01:36:41,465
Thank you

845
01:36:41,673 --> 01:36:42,925
It's my pleasure.

846
01:36:44,676 --> 01:36:45,844
Are you alright?

847
01:36:46,887 --> 01:36:48,138
Fine

848
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:53,143
And I keep thinking, he's dead,
now what?

849
01:36:53,268 --> 01:36:55,771
Well the dam we saw will have to come down

850
01:36:55,938 --> 01:36:59,108
And there'll be others too
Someone who worked for Greene might be of help

851
01:37:00,776 --> 01:37:02,444
Not a bad idea.

852
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:09,618
Do you think they'll be able to sleep now?

853
01:37:12,538 --> 01:37:15,040
I don't think the dead care about vengence

854
01:37:18,168 --> 01:37:21,088
I wish I could set you free

855
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:27,219
But your prison is in there

856
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:22,524
Fine, anything for an easy life

857
01:38:24,227 --> 01:38:25,061
Sit down

858
01:38:26,313 --> 01:38:27,997
Sit down!

859
01:38:29,149 --> 01:38:30,400
It's ok baby.

860
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,461
You're Canadian?

861
01:38:49,878 --> 01:38:51,963
You work in Canadian intelligence?

862
01:38:52,597 --> 01:38:54,766
That's all right, I know you do

863
01:38:55,225 --> 01:38:57,000
And knowing this man,

864
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,679
I'd guess you have access to some
very sensitive material

865
01:38:59,813 --> 01:39:02,098
which you're going to be forced to give up

866
01:39:01,482 --> 01:39:05,653
His life will be threatened, and because
you love him, you won't hesitate

867
01:39:06,695 --> 01:39:08,364
It is a beautiful necklace

868
01:39:09,406 --> 01:39:11,075
Did he give it to you?

869
01:39:13,243 --> 01:39:15,579
I have one just like it

870
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:20,667
He gave it to a friend of mine

871
01:39:21,419 --> 01:39:23,921
Someone very close to me

872
01:39:26,424 --> 01:39:28,301
Your name is?
- Corine.

873
01:39:28,426 --> 01:39:29,552
Corine.

874
01:39:30,261 --> 01:39:33,098
Corine I suggest you leave now,
you contact you're people,

875
01:39:33,223 --> 01:39:35,808
and you tell them to check their seals
- they have a leak

876
01:39:36,434 --> 01:39:38,185
Do it now, please

877
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:42,189
This man and I have some unfinished business

878
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:54,077
Thank you

879
01:39:58,665 --> 01:39:59,916
Please

880
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,127
Make it quick

881
01:40:11,586 --> 01:40:12,754
Is he still alive?

882
01:40:13,255 --> 01:40:14,214
He is

883
01:40:14,923 --> 01:40:16,091
I am surprised

884
01:40:17,425 --> 01:40:19,511
Did you find what you were looking for?

885
01:40:19,928 --> 01:40:21,304
Yes.
- Good.

886
01:40:22,681 --> 01:40:25,058
I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

887
01:40:25,684 --> 01:40:26,852
What about you?

888
01:40:27,769 --> 01:40:29,820
Of course not.
It would be unprofessional

889
01:40:32,008 --> 01:40:35,485
They found Greene dead in the middle
of the Bolivian desert, of all places

890
01:40:35,694 --> 01:40:37,863
Two bullets in the back of his skull

891
01:40:38,405 --> 01:40:40,699
They found motor oil
in his stomach

892
01:40:41,032 --> 01:40:42,701
Does that mean anything to you?

893
01:40:42,285 --> 01:40:43,786
I wish I could help.

894
01:40:43,953 --> 01:40:47,123
You'll be glad to know I straightened things
out with the Americans

895
01:40:47,206 --> 01:40:49,500
Your friend Leiter (Felix) has been promoted

896
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:50,877
He'll replace Beam

897
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,129
Well then, the right people
kept their jobs

898
01:40:53,379 --> 01:40:54,830
Something like that

899
01:40:56,799 --> 01:40:58,551
Congratulations, you were right

900
01:40:59,302 --> 01:41:00,344
About what?

901
01:41:01,596 --> 01:41:03,055
About Vesper

902
01:41:05,349 --> 01:41:06,726
Ma'am!

903
01:41:09,103 --> 01:41:10,479
Bond

904
01:41:11,606 --> 01:41:13,065
I need you back

905
01:41:13,983 --> 01:41:15,985
I never left

906
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,985
