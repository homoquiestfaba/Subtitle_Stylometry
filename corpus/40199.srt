1
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,200
The city of Townsville...

2
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,100
...is in some serious...

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,100
...serious, serious trouble!

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
Day after day...

5
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,400
...crime, lawlessness
and evil are running rampant.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,800
Its citizens have lost all hope.

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,500
They are utterly helpless
and in desperate need of a true hero.

8
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,000
But who?

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,500
Is there no one who can help
this forsaken town...

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,300
...and make it a better place?

11
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,600
Fear not, fair viewers, for there
is a man, a man of science...

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,200
...a forward-thinking man,
who looks back to a sweeter time...

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,300
...when there was spice to life,
and everything was...nice.

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,200
I must profess, sir...

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,700
...this man holds the ingredients
to Townsville's salvation!

16
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,700
This man, known simply as:

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
The Professor.

18
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,900
Hi!

19
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,800
What's your name?

20
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,000
My name is Professor.
Professor Utonium. Hello!

21
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,300
Hello, Professor Utonium.
It's very nice to meet you.

22
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,100
It's very nice to meet you too.

23
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,700
-What are your names?
-You made us, so shouldn't you name us?

24
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay. This is so cool!

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,700
Well, now, let's see.

26
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,300
Because of your directness and opening
right up to me, I think I'll call you...

27
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
...Blossom.

28
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Well, aren't you all cute and bubbly!
That's it! You'll be my little...

29
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
...Bubbles.

30
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,900
So we have Blossom, Bubbles and...

31
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,500
...Buttercup. Because...

32
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
...it also begins with a B.

33
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
And together you are
three perfect little g--

34
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,800
Gifts! Birthday! It's your birthday!
I should get gifts!

35
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,100
Wow! I wanted to make some kids
I could teach right from wrong...

36
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,000
...and in turn, maybe they'd do good
for this town, and now I can!

37
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
All I gotta do is be a good parent.

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,900
Note to self : Good parents
don't leave kids alone.

39
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,000
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

40
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
Who knew that's what girls
were made of !

41
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,100
I can't believe I made perfect girls!

42
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Three normal little gi--

43
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,300
You should be careful when coming
down the steps! You could get hurt.

44
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000
Hey, are these for us?

45
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Thanks, Professor!

46
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,600
-Hey, thanks!
-Yes, Professor! Thank you.

47
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,100
This is the best gift ever...

48
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,500
...Dad.

49
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,100
Yes, it is.

50
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, girls, now watch me.

51
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,900
I think you missed a spot.

52
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,200
I'll go wash up,
then we'll bring in the furniture.

53
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,600
Girls, wait! You should let me--

54
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Help?

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,800
This looks pretty good.
What do you think?

56
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,500
-I think it's a little dark.
-I like it dark.

57
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,000
-Some windows might be nice.
-Yeah! I could see some windows.

58
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,500
Right about here.

59
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,700
I'll call a contractor tomor--

60
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
Or that works too.

61
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
Who's hungry?

62
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,900
-Ready?
-Ready!

63
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Go!

64
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,500
Okay, girls. Time for--

65
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,200
Bed.

66
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,900
-Wake up, girls! Time for school.
-What's school?

67
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,400
This is school.
I'm your teacher, Ms. Keane...

68
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,600
...and this is where
kids come to learn. See?

69
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
You wanna play?

70
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
Do you think they'll be okay?

71
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm new at this parenting thing,
and I wanted to meet you...

72
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,500
...because they're really special.
I mean, really special...

73
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,700
...and I just want to make sure they'll
be okay. Do you think they'll be okay?

74
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,600
They'll be just fine, Professor.
We'll see you at noon.

75
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,800
Okay. Bye, girls. Bye. Bye.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.

76
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,300
Okay, class. Take your seats.

77
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,000
-Can Blossom sit with us?
-Can we sit with Bubbles?

78
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
Can Buttercup sit here?

79
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,500
The girls can sit right in the middle,
so they'll be next to everyone.

80
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,600
Now, let's begin!

81
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,500
Hello, Professor.
Right on time.

82
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,000
Your girls are outside
with the others.

83
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh, no! Look at this mess.

84
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,700
I knew the girls would
be a handful, but I'm so sorry.

85
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,400
What, this?

86
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,900
This is what happens
when you put 20 kids in one room.

87
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,800
Your girls were perfect.

88
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Perfect, normal,
well-behaved little girls.

89
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,700
-Nothing out of the ordinary?
-No. Like what?

90
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,700
-That was sweet!
-What's the point of this game, anyway?

91
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
Tag! You're it!

92
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,700
Everyone's running from her
like she's been infected!

93
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,400
-Maybe she's a freak.
-Yeah, and they hate her!

94
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,400
-You're it!
-Tag! You're it!

95
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh, no! I've been affected!

96
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,200
-All right, what's going on here?
-I've been affected!

97
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,600
You're not infected, it's just a game.

98
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,500
-It is?
-Yeah.

99
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,400
-A game? Neat!
-Yeah, how do we play?

100
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Okay, look, it's very simple.
Bubbles, tag me.

101
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,200
Come on, it's okay.

102
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,100
All right, now I'm it.

103
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,700
And all you gots to do to play
is tag someone else, and they're it.

104
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,200
By the way, you're it!

105
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Awesome, I'm it! What do I do?
What do I do?

106
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,300
Just tag someone else,
and they're it!

107
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,300
Time to put it into overdrive,
Bubbles!

108
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,400
Tag! You're it!

109
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm gonna tag you guys now.

110
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
You missed us!

111
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,700
-Tag! You're it!
-No! No, I'm not!

112
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,200
Tag! You're it!

113
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,600
Tag!

114
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Missed me!

115
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,200
No, you're it!

116
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Tag!

117
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm it?

118
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Tag!

119
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
Tag! Got you!

120
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,100
-Got you!
-Missed me!

121
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,900
Girls, no! Wait!

122
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,100
Can't catch me!

123
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,500
Oh, no!

124
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Subway, huh?

125
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,900
Tag. You're it.

126
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
There they--

127
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,600
Here she comes!

128
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,600
Suckers.

129
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,400
Tag. You're it.

130
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,500
You know, I've got a nice car.

131
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
-You're it.
-No, you're it!

132
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Hey!

133
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,800
She'll never find us up here.

134
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,600
Do you hear something?

135
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Run!

136
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,500
Tag! You're both it!

137
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,800
Hey!

138
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
-We can't both be it.
-Why not?

139
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
-Tag.
-What? I can't be it twice!

140
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,400
-Why not?
-Okay then.

141
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,800
Tag. Now you guys are it.

142
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,300
-Tag.
-Tags.

143
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,000
-Hey, no tag backs! Tag!
-Tag!

144
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
-Tag!
-Tag!

145
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
-Tag!
-Tag!

146
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,700
-Tag!
-Tag!

147
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
-You're it!
-You're it!

148
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,300
Oh, boy.

149
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,600
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

150
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,900
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

151
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh, boy.

152
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,200
Mayor, the town is being destroyed
by three girls with freakish powers.

153
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,100
This is a very serious situation.
What action should we take?

154
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,100
-Tag, tag!
-Tag, tag, tag!

155
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,100
Don't worry. We have the situation
under control.

156
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,100
-Oh, boy.
-I know, sir.

157
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
-Oh, boy.
-You tell them, Mayor.

158
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,300
Townsville will not stand for this.

159
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,300
Mayor? Hello?
City being destroyed?

160
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,900
-Where are you going?
-Oh, boy.

161
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,500
Mayor, where are you going?
We're in a serious pickle.

162
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
Exactly.

163
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
Girls, no!

164
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
Hello.

165
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,700
Hello.

166
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,600
The usual, Cucor.

167
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,700
I have a fine vintage for you here.
Picked fresh today.

168
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Oh, boy!

169
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Girls, girls, are you okay?

170
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,900
Tag! You're it, Professor!

171
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,100
Okay, girls. Girls, it's almost
bedtime, okay? Girls?

172
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,300
Come on, Professor, you're it.
You gotta catch us.

173
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,100
Yes, I suppose I do, don't I?

174
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,600
Got you, you little bunny.

175
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,400
Help! I got caughted!
Blossom, watch out!

176
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,000
You're the sole survivor!

177
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,500
No way, Professor!
You can't catch me.

178
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,800
Yes, I can because the game's over,
and it's your bedtime.

179
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,900
Now come up here so we can catch you.

180
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,500
Well now, three little girls had
a very busy day today, didn't they?

181
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,500
Yeah, it was fun.
We met lots of kids.

182
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,000
-And we learned things.
-And we played tag!

183
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,500
I'm glad you had so much fun
because tomorrow will be busy too.

184
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Put your nighties on and get in bed.
We need to talk about something.

185
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,900
-Okay, everybody in?
-Yep, what's up, Daddy-o?

186
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,600
Well, it's your super powers.

187
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm not sure how to say this...

188
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,300
...but I don't think you should
use them in public anymore.

189
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
Why?

190
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,400
Well, your powers
are very special and unique...

191
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,200
...and although we have a lot of fun
doing things in the house...

192
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,300
...out in Townsville, people don't
understand how special you girls are.

193
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,100
And unfortunately, people
often get scared or angry...

194
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,300
...when they don't understand
something special or unique.

195
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,700
That's silly.

196
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,600
I think so too, but nonetheless, take
it easy with the powers tomorrow.

197
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,000
Just give Townsville a little time
to understand your specialness, okay?

198
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,100
-Okay.
-Okay.

199
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
-Yeah.
-People are nice. Things will be fine.

200
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,300
So I'll be waiting here to pick you up
when school gets out, okay?

201
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,700
Okay, but don't worry, Professor.
Things are gonna be fine.

202
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,700
Girls, we didn't know
if you'd be joining us today.

203
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,000
Take your seats.

204
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,100
I'm sorry to say there won't be
any recess for a while...

205
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,900
...due to all the reconstruction.

206
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,800
Secondly, I'm afraid we won't have
any lights or water for a while.

207
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,900
And a broken refrigerator
means snack-time is out...

208
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,500
...so let's try to ignore
all the workmen and noise and such...

209
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,700
...and get right to work, shall we?

210
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,100
Girls, can you recite
the alphabet for us?

211
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,800
Girls? ABCs?

212
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,500
A, B, C, D.... E!

213
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Hey, galldang it!
You done darn broke my board.

214
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Flamdanggling consarglers.

215
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,900
F....

216
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,900
Almost time to pick up the girls.

217
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Better motor.

218
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,300
That's him, boys!

219
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,300
He's in cahoots
with the evil pickle-cart killers...

220
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,300
...cucumber crushers,
vinegar varlets, dill-stroyers!

221
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Why, it's not kosher! It's--

222
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
Let it go, Mayor. Let it go.

223
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,500
-Are these your babies?
-Yes, but they were just playing.

224
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,300
They're really very good little girls.
And I need to pick them up from school.

225
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,400
I understand, sir...

226
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,500
...but we want you to come downtown
with us to ask you a few questions.

227
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,300
You guys, my kids.
I really ought to pick them up.

228
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
I can't just leave them there...

229
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
...alone.

230
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,500
He's not coming. He hates us.
He totally hates us.

231
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,500
No, he probably just got held up,
or maybe the car broke...

232
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,000
...or maybe he forgot...

233
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,500
...or maybe he hates us.

234
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,500
Come on, let's try
and find our way home.

235
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,200
We're not supposed to use our powers.

236
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,900
Come on, girls.

237
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,200
The cause?
Three super powered little girls.

238
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,400
Should manufacturing
super powered children be illegal?

239
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,000
A great travesty has befallen
our beloved city.

240
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:05,400
I was easing the seat back when this
atomic punk flies in with no warning.

241
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,100
The devastation? Devastating.

242
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,700
It should be illegal.

243
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,900
Used to be a time when
you could buy an honest pickle.

244
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,500
They were lighting up the sky.

245
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,400
Estimated dollars in damages?
A whopping 25 million.

246
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm offended just looking at them.

247
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,100
The kind that you can only find
at a pickle cart.

248
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,700
Now Jamie's crying.

249
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,500
-Well, it seems that--
-Hatred is running rampant for--

250
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,300
-Those mutant, bug-eyed--
-Pickle-cart killing--

251
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,300
Freaks. Back to you, Linda.

252
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
They are little freaks, aren't they?
With more on this subject is--

253
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,800
Get them out. We don't need them.
We don't need them.

254
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,300
We interrupt this program
for a news flash.

255
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,100
Arrested in connection
with the tag incident...

256
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,800
...was the scientist responsible for
creating the girls, Professor Utonium.

257
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,300
Upon incarceration,
the Professor made this statement:

258
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Please, just let me go.
My girls, they need me.

259
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,600
They don't know I'm in jail.

260
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,700
What if they try
to go home themselves?

261
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,300
They can't find their way
if they don't fly.

262
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,000
Please, they're only little girls
who are probably cold, scared...

263
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,000
...and maybe even lost.

264
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,500
Well, it's official.
I have no idea where we are.

265
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Well, I can't say
it's been the best day.

266
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,800
But it probably couldn't
get much worse.

267
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,600
Hey, it's okay. Maybe there's
a box we can get in around back.

268
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,300
Come on.

269
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,700
See, there's a whole bunch of boxes.

270
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,300
What's the matter?

271
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,700
Did somebody get lost?

272
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
Wow, thanks!

273
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,100
Hey, wait! Come back.

274
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,900
Hey, guys, over here.

275
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,300
-Hi. What's your name? I'm Blossom.
-Buttercup.

276
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,000
And I'm Bubbles.

277
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,300
Go away, please. Do not look at me.

278
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,000
We just wanted to thank you
for saving us from those gangsters.

279
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,900
That was amazing
with the trashcan lid.

280
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,900
It was all: swoosh, bang,
splash, bam, boom.

281
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,300
Yeah, you rock.

282
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,300
No, please. I dare not listen...

283
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,300
...for I have been lashed
by harsh tongues for too long.

284
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,800
Alas, my little ones, I do not rock.

285
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,900
For I, Jojo, am a monster.

286
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,200
You're not a monster.
Monsters are evil.

287
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,600
Anybody who would save us
like you did is so not evil.

288
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,000
You're no monster, mister.
You're just really dirty.

289
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,100
Please. You're just trying
to make me feel better.

290
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,500
But my pain is not for you
to understand.

291
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,100
Besides, how could you?

292
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,800
For you are pure and innocent
and, most certainly, loved.

293
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,300
How could you know what it is
to be cast out...

294
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,000
...into a world
that only offers misery?

295
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,800
How could you know what it's like
for people to fear and despise you...

296
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,700
...for the very things
that make you special...

297
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,400
...because you don't fit in,
because you are...

298
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
...a freak?!

299
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,200
Because...

300
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,100
...we're freaks too.

301
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,600
-What amazing powers!
-No, they're terrible.

302
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,600
-I bet everyone hates them.
-Yeah.

303
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,200
-And they hate you too.
-Yes.

304
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,600
I am in the same boat.

305
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,500
This brain is full of brilliant ideas.

306
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,100
But will anyone listen? No.

307
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,400
Nothing in this gray matters.

308
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,100
So, what's the point?

309
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
Jojo, don't be sad.

310
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,700
Our dad says people get angry
when they don't understand...

311
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,700
...something special or unique.

312
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,100
If you just give people time, they'll
start to understand your specialness.

313
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,300
Yeah. You just gotta believe
in yourself.

314
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,900
If I construct my Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine...

315
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,200
...people will come to understand
my specialness?

316
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,900
I'll do it,
but I'll need your help.

317
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,300
Jump in, take this device
into the volcano.

318
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,600
We need to harness the energy
of the Earth's core for power.

319
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,600
-What are you talking about?
-The plan.

320
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,300
-What plan?
-Our plan.

321
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,800
-To do what?
-To make the town better.

322
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
-What?
-You know.

323
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,600
We will build the Help-the-town-
and-make-it-a-better-place machine.

324
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,000
Everyone will see our special
abilities are good. They will love us.

325
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Remember? It was your idea.

326
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, yeah. But use our powers?

327
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,900
-Yes.
-No way.

328
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
-Come on.
-No.

329
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,300
We're never using our powers again.

330
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,200
Girls, don't be sad.

331
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,500
Your powers are great.
You just gotta believe in yourself.

332
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,300
Yes! Yes! Yes!

333
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,800
-We did good?
-You did very good. Very good indeed.

334
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,400
-Now what do we do?
-We construct the superstructure.

335
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Look. Can't you see
our plan is working?

336
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,700
Our work is proceeding as planned.
At last, our lives will be better.

337
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600
At last, we will be accepted.

338
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,800
At last, our greatest work is comple--

339
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,000
-Oops.
-What's wrong?

340
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,800
Well...

341
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,600
...there is one last teeny-tiny,
itsy-bitsy thing we still need.

342
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,700
Yes! Yes! Yes!

343
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,200
-We did good?
-You did very good. Very good indeed.

344
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,700
Now what do we do?

345
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,200
Well, because you've done so good...

346
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,900
...I've got a special surprise.

347
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,500
-Worthless.
-Lame.

348
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
-Stupid.
-Okay.

349
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,000
-Better.
-Almost.

350
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
Awesome!

351
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,100
Come, girls, our work is fin--

352
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,600
I mean, time to go.

353
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,600
But, Jojo....

354
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
-We haven't seen the gazelles.
-Or the crocodiles.

355
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Or the unicorns. Just one unic--

356
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,500
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think you dropped this.

357
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,400
I thought the zoo kept
all the animals in cages.

358
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,700
Yeah, well, you're welcome, lady.

359
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,600
Don't listen, Bubbles.

360
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,500
That's right, Bubbles, do not listen.

361
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,400
All of you, deafen yourselves
to their heartless words.

362
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
They do not know it is their saviors
they are speaking to.

363
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,600
They are unaware your actions will
have helped change their world forever.

364
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,800
Because we have helped the town
and made it a better place.

365
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
-You think they'll be surprised?
-Oh, yeah.

366
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,900
Will they still be mad at us
for playing tag?

367
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,800
No, they'll have forgotten
all about that.

368
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,000
Will they love us?

369
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,400
Yes.

370
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,600
-Really?
-Would I lie to you?

371
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,200
-I'm so excited!
-We'll show them!

372
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Hey, where's--?

373
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,300
Professor!

374
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,300
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.

375
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I'm so sorry.
I'm a terrible, terrible parent.

376
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,000
You must hate me for not picking you
up from school, but it's not my fault.

377
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,000
It's this town. They've gone crazy.

378
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,400
It's like they've never seen kids
playing before.

379
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,000
I knew your powers would take some
getting used to. But jail? Lawsuits?

380
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,700
Angry mobs? What's next?

381
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,400
Don't worry, Professor. Things are
gonna get better. We promise.

382
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,500
-Today's the day.
-Today's the day!

383
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Today's the day!

384
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,400
-Today's--
-The day.

385
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,500
-What to wear?
-What to wear?

386
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
That's nice.

387
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,200
Professor, wake up! Wake up.

388
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,900
-Wake--
-Up. Wake up, my brothers.

389
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
-Wake up and seize the--
-Day!

390
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,500
-The day?
-Yeah, the day when we--

391
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,700
Show Townsville just what
our powers can really do.

392
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
What?

393
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,200
We're gonna show Townsville
just what our powers can really do.

394
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,900
-We did something really good.
-That's gonna really--

395
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Help!

396
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,300
Well, we met this guy.

397
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,200
With powers like us.

398
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,200
Who was also hated by everybody.

399
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,300
But he had this great idea.

400
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,800
To help the town.

401
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,900
And make it a better place.

402
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,700
-That way the town would accept us.
-We did something to help.

403
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,500
So we used all our powers.

404
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,800
And abilities.

405
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,500
And his ideas.

406
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
-To help everybody.
-City of Townsville...

407
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,800
-It's gonna be so cool.
-...I'd like to take this moment...

408
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,000
-You're gonna be so proud.
-...to thank the little people...

409
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,800
Everyone's gonna love us.

410
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,100
...who helped to make this day
a smashing success.

411
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,700
We did really goo--

412
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup,
I couldn't have done it without you.

413
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,100
-It's their fault!
-I knew they were no good!

414
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,200
What happened?

415
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,800
This isn't making the town
a better place.

416
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,500
Yes, it is, for me. The hobo
formerly known as ''Jojo'' is no more.

417
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,400
From this day forward,
I shall be known as:

418
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Mojo Jojo!

419
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,300
For too long, apes and monkeys
have been under the thumb of man.

420
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,000
Well, the time has come
to oppose that thumb...

421
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,900
...and take hold
of what is rightfully ours:

422
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100
The world!

423
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,300
Professor, we didn't want this.

424
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,800
-Liars.
-Fibbers.

425
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,500
You've doomed us all.

426
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,400
Please, Professor.

427
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,200
Please believe us.

428
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
I don't know who to believe.

429
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I thought you were good.

430
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,500
No!

431
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,500
Yeah! All right!

432
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,700
I rock!

433
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
I rock so hard.

434
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,000
For I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

435
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,700
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever.

436
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,000
And I, Mojo Jojo, shall be...

437
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,200
...king of the planet of the apes!

438
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,900
You shall be king? Preposterous.

439
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,500
What? How dare you.

440
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,800
For it is I who is the one
most suited to be ruler.

441
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,400
Those are my clothes.

442
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,600
I, Ojo Tango, shall be simian supreme.

443
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,400
No Ojo. Mojo.

444
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,400
As I unleash the offensive omnipotence
of the oppressive Orango-tank.

445
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,300
-Hold on.
-Oh, no!

446
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,300
-I shall get a grip on the situation.
-You better not.

447
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,000
As I, Rocko Socko,
seize control and rule.

448
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,300
-Wait!
-I, Baboon Kaboom...

449
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,200
...with my Baboom-bot,
will be the bomb.

450
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,300
And if you don't like it...

451
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,600
...you can sniff my Baboom-bot bombs.

452
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,600
That's classy.

453
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,200
Gangway! For we, the Gogo Po-Trol...

454
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,400
...form a chain of command
that will take hold of your world.

455
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,300
I, Hota Wata, am boiling mad,
for you are all wet behind the ears.

456
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,800
So I shall unleash a scalding torrent
to drown you out, for I don't give a--

457
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,900
Watch your mouth.

458
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,100
I, Cha-Ching Cha-Ching,
symbolize chaotic calamity.

459
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,000
We, the Doot Da Doot Da Doo Doos,
shall rain on your parade because...

460
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,500
...we're the spit.

461
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,600
My name is Hacha Chacha
And here is my schpiel

462
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,400
A diabolical plan with lots of appeal

463
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,300
Spreading out bananas far and wide

464
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,600
And fixing up the folks
For a slippery slide

465
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,900
Pretty catchy.

466
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,800
I, Blah-Blah-Blah-Blah, shall create
a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble...

467
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,600
...with a destructive force
known as the tormato.

468
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,000
-Tormato?
-Tormato.

469
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,900
-I, Killa Drilla.
-I, Bonzo Bango.

470
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,500
-I, Rolo Ovo.
-I, Cruncha Muncha.

471
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,600
-I, Wacko Smacko.
-I, Pappy Whappy.

472
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,500
No!

473
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,100
Do not continue with your ramblings.
Mine are the ramblings to be obeyed.

474
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,700
I am the king, supreme leader
and dictator.

475
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,900
Your plans are my plans because you
made plans and my plan was to make you.

476
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,600
I plan to rule the planet,
not to have my plans plan to stop me.

477
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,200
I am your creator, I am your king.

478
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:31,200
I am Mojo Jojo. Obey me!

479
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,500
That jerk, that big, fat, dumb jerk.
He duped us.

480
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,500
He planned it all along,
and we fell for it.

481
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,900
And now, everybody hates us even more.

482
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,300
What are you doing?

483
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,100
What does it look like I'm doing?

484
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,700
I'm building a house
because now we have to live here.

485
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,900
-Live here?
-Yeah, don't you see?

486
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,600
This can be the bedroom,
and this is my bed.

487
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,700
That can be your bed over there.

488
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,400
I don't wanna sleep on a rock!

489
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,000
Maybe if someone hadn't pushed
Bubbles into the school....

490
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,700
Look, she speaks.

491
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,300
Maybe if somebody hadn't insisted
on walking home...

492
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,400
...so we could run
into the biggest liar in the universe!

493
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,000
We weren't allowed to use our powers,
and you know it!

494
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,100
Look, it's Miss Goody-Goody.

495
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,700
We weren't gonna get people
to stop hating us by breaking rules.

496
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,300
Yeah. And using our super powers...

497
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,900
...to make a Help-the-town-and-
make-it-a-better-place machine...

498
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,600
...was following rules?!

499
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,700
-I didn't see you putting up a fight.
-Well, you're gonna now.

500
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,800
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be in this stupid mess.

501
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,500
You stupid!

502
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,600
I'm not fighting with you, Buttercup.

503
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,500
Because you know I'll kick your butt.

504
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,500
No, because I know--
Never mind.

505
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,800
I'm not fighting with you,
and I'm not talking to you ever!

506
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,400
Well, prepare yourself
for a long silence, girl...

507
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,300
...because we're gonna spend the rest
of our lives here, thanks to you.

508
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,600
At least I got me a bed.

509
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,500
Blossom? Buttercup?

510
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,300
Do you hear that?

511
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,600
No!

512
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,600
Blossom, what should we do?

513
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Miss Goody-Goody'll say we should take
responsibility for our mistakes...

514
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,900
-...and go help everybody.
-It sounds like they're hurting.

515
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,700
Who cares?

516
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,100
-What do we do?
-Nothing.

517
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,600
-Girls!
-Professor!

518
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,800
Professor! Professor! Professor!

519
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,500
Help!

520
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,800
Bubbles, wait!

521
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,600
-Good job, but we've gotta save--
-The baby!

522
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,700
Holy....

523
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,600
-Hey, what about--?
-The dog!

524
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,300
-You'll be safe now.
-Here you go, miss.

525
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,200
-Thank you.
-Come on, Bubbles, let's--

526
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,400
Save those people.

527
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,100
Wait! This isn't my baby.

528
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,100
Good dog.

529
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,000
Can we find the Professor now, please?

530
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,500
Oh, man!

531
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,300
Now stay!

532
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,300
Doggone it!

533
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,300
Okay. You should be safe here.

534
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,000
This is hopeless!

535
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,300
I know. There's too many monkeys.
What can we do?

536
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,500
Get your hands off him,
you darn dirty ape!

537
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,200
I didn't mean it!
It was an accident!

538
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,100
He wouldn't let go!
And the dog.

539
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,800
That stupid dog,
and then the monkeys, and he--

540
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,400
I couldn't-- He couldn't--
Oh, man!

541
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,300
Buttercup!
You're a genius!

542
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,800
-I am?
-She is?

543
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,300
Yeah. The one way to stop the monkeys,
save the town and find the Professor...

544
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,400
...is to use our powers to--

545
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,700
Better yet, watch!

546
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,200
-Wow!
-That was amaz-- Hey!

547
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,300
Gross! Cut it out.

548
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,400
Come on, girls. Let's put an end
to this gorilla warfare.

549
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,300
Good one, Bubbles.

550
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,400
-Girls--
-Shut up! I was afraid of this.

551
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,700
They've returned and found out
what their powers can really do.

552
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,100
Come. You will make
a good ''Power-proof'' vest.

553
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,800
-None of those monkeys had Professor!
-Where could he be?

554
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,600
Take a good guess!

555
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,400
Come on, girls! We've got
one last monkey to get off our backs!

556
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,200
Not so fast...

557
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,100
...Mojo Jojo!

558
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:10,200
Look at the little heroes
here to save their daddy!

559
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,400
No, girls! Save yourselves!

560
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,100
-Sorry, Professor!
-We can take this chump chimp down!

561
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,600
Nothing he can do can stop us!

562
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,200
That's better.

563
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,200
It's good you little freaks
know when you're beaten.

564
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,800
Now if you'll excuse me, I, Mojo Jojo,
have a town to take over!

565
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,400
I have a world to rule!
I have to seize control of an area...

566
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,200
...and force its inhabitants
to follow my way of thinking!

567
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,700
Even if it means...

568
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,300
...taking extreme measures!

569
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,400
-You wouldn't!
-I would!

570
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,900
Professor!

571
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,300
Now I am more Mojo than before!

572
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,500
Now, as I was saying before
I was so rudely interrupted...

573
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,100
...I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded...

574
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:09,800
...in my first, greatest
and most brilliant plan ever!

575
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,300
And I, Mojo Jojo...

576
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,900
...shall be king!

577
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,400
Girls, thank goodness you're okay.
Now let's get out of this town!

578
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,600
-It's no use.
-We already tried running away.

579
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,100
We have to fix the problem
we helped start.

580
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,600
You said to give everyone time
to understand our specialness.

581
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,500
Well, now it's time for everyone
to understand. Especially Mojo!

582
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,600
Surrender now,
and we'll go easy on you!

583
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,600
Down here!

584
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,600
Oh, my! You're actually
trying to stop me?

585
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,500
That's so cute!

586
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,800
-Try, nothing!
-We will stop you!

587
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,900
Who are you calling ''cute''?

588
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,900
Okay, let's play!

589
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,200
Buttercup!

590
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:09,100
-Good job, girls!
-That more Mojo is no more!

591
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,400
Girls!

592
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,400
Somebody's mad.

593
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,700
Look out!

594
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,500
Oh, no, look!
Mojo's got Blossom pinned down!

595
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,700
I have an idea. Come on!

596
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,800
-Do you think he's finished?
-No, but you are!

597
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,300
Fools! You dare to challenge me?

598
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,000
Attempt to defeat me?

599
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,600
Try to destroy me?!

600
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,500
I, who saved you from certain death?

601
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,300
After all I've done for you,
you betray me?

602
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,500
And why? For them?

603
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,300
The ones who hated you....

604
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,100
Have forsaken you?

605
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:04,200
Can't you see? None of them
will ever understand you as I can.

606
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,600
For we are kindred spirits, whose
powers spring from the same source.

607
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,500
So, girls, do not make me destroy you.

608
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:20,200
For we are smarter, we are stronger!

609
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,600
We are invincible!
We have the power!

610
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,300
We are superior to them!

611
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,500
And we shall rule!

612
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:38,700
All we have to do is work together.

613
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,600
Girls, join me.

614
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,000
No!

615
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,600
We'd never join you,
and it's because we are stronger.

616
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:06,900
-Because we are invincible.
-Because we have the power!

617
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,400
We have to protect them from you!

618
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,700
-It's you who has to be feared.
-Because you are a monster!

619
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,400
You are evil!

620
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,400
And you are...

621
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,500
...it!

622
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,800
Curses!

623
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,500
Girls, you were right!
We should stop Mojo, and I know how!

624
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,100
I whipped up an antidote to Chemical X!
It'll do away with his powers!

625
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:04,200
I'm so sorry for doubting you. You are
good little girls, and I love you!

626
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,000
We love you too!

627
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,400
-And we're really sorry.
-We messed up really bad.

628
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,900
-But we're ready, Professor.
-Ready?

629
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,800
To take the Antidote X
to get rid of our powers.

630
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
If it wasn't for them,
none of this would have happened.

631
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,000
And maybe everyone would like us more
if we were just normal little girls.

632
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,900
No!

633
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,500
Don't do that...

634
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,500
...because that was pretty cool,
with the....

635
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,800
Girls, I think what the Mayor
is trying to say is...

636
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,100
...we're sorry, and thank you.

637
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,600
Yes, that was super, just super!

638
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,200
-Amazing!
-Fantastic!

639
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,900
-Wonderful!
-Stupendous!

640
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,500
You rock!

641
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,100
Thank you.

642
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,200
That was awesome!
You were all flying and running!

643
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,600
And then, laser eyes!
Then, bam!

644
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,200
And then-- And then, bam,
you punched that guy! Remember?

645
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:25,300
Yeah, that was great.
You know, this town stinks.

646
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,900
And I was wondering if,
maybe sometime...

647
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,200
...we could, like, call you
to save the day or whatever.

648
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,200
Can we, Professor?

649
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,400
Well, I don't know....

650
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,600
Okay, but only if
it's before your bedtime.

651
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,200
Help!

652
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,900
Sugar, spice and everything nice.

653
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,300
These were the ingredients chosen
to create the perfect little girl.

654
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,000
But Professor Utonium accidentally
added an extra ingredient to the mix:

655
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,500
Chemical X.

656
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:41,200
Thus Blossom, Bubbles
and Buttercup were born!

657
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,800
Using their ultra super powers,
they've dedicated their lives...

658
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,100
...to fighting crime
and the forces of evil.

659
01:07:54,500 --> 01:08:00,700
And so for the very first time,
the day is saved, thanks to:

660
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,500
The Powerpuff Girls!

661
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:08,300
Hey, that's a good name for them.
Powerpuff Girls, yeah!

662
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,700
I like that. Wonder if they will.
I'll run it by them.

663
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,200
Powerpuff Girls!
