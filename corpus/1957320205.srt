[somber orchestral music]

00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:22,033
[Jacqueline] As I walked down the aisle,

5
00:00:22,035 --> 00:00:23,438
I feared the inevitable.

6
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:30,388
It had waited on the horizon,
but now it was before me.

7
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:36,453
This wedding did not
begin a new life for me,

8
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:39,235
but rather, ended the only one I'd known.

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,038
My father, Jimmy Bombay,
chose this fate for me.

10
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:52,483
I was to wed Dante Calivari,
the son of a Cartel drug lord

11
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,252
and diamond runner from Russia.

12
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,613
I had tried everything I could think of

13
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:01,708
to avoid this moment.

14
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,038
But what I've learned in life

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,630
is that when you are stripped
of all that you have,

16
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,348
you either fold your
cards, or leave your mark,

17
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:16,452
and this was mine.

18
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:22,488
[gun fires]
[guests scream]

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,157
[brooding electronic music]

20
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:11,076
[ominous tones]

21
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,828
Father, I have sinned.

22
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:18,533
Forgive me. It's been too
long since my last confession.

23
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:20,983
You seem troubled. What's wrong?

24
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:23,048
[Jacqueline] Well, I have
done something unforgivable.

25
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:26,593
God will forgive you, if
your heart is truly repentant.

26
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:27,428
So, don't worry.

27
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,853
You can talk to me. I'm not
here to judge you, dear.

28
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:36,828
I'm just here to listen and to counsel.

29
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,283
[Jacqueline] I have
sinned against my family.

30
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,363
Last week, I was a bride.

31
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,702
And this week, you're a wife.

32
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:47,133
[Jacqueline] I have
sinned against my husband.

33
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:48,452
How have you sinned?

34
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:52,003
[Jacqueline] I have sinned
in a most unforgivable way.

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,148
Were you unfaithful?

36
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,693
[Jacqueline] Father, it's
not that I was unfaithful

37
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:58,118
to my husband.

38
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:01,617
It's that I killed him.

39
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:04,119
[eerie music]

40
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,678
Dante Calivari.

00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:13,117
[tense music]

42
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:16,286
[distant sirens wail]

43
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,883
Dante successfully worked
the Miami drug scene

44
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:26,195
when my father met him.

45
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:28,530
[guns fire]

46
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:34,569
[gun fires]

47
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:39,523
[gun fires]

48
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:42,100
Dante worked alongside
his girlfriend, Angela,

49
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,698
who set up customers for him.

50
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:46,683
[water splashes]

51
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,163
Lou Bishop, his trusted bodyguard,

52
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,218
also worked the Miami streets with him.

53
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:53,723
[Dante] Sit.

54
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:56,283
[Jacqueline] For Dante, it was a dream.

55
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,673
He was living the high-life.

56
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:02,783
Dante and his drug-dealing
Barbie doll had quite the scheme.

57
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,993
Angela would set up the
coke deals around town

58
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,703
and Dante worked distribution,

59
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,338
using the direct supply line
from his family overseas.

60
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:15,011
[Dealer] Dante, take a
seat. I must talk to you.

61
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,022
How've you been?

62
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,343
Very good.

63
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:20,372
[Dealer] I see you have
brought Lou Bishop as well with.

64
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,793
I want you to understand something.

65
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,843
I think your father has
been most unreasonable

66
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:27,953
with his prices with me.

67
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:30,893
It is my goal to distribute
product through Miami

68
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,282
and all of Florida, but these prices,

69
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:34,813
Dante, they are unacceptable.

70
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:37,648
You must talk to your father.
They can not continue.

71
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,556
[gun fires]

72
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:45,308
[dramatic music]

73
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:47,856
Immediately, my father knew the potential

74
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:49,928
of Dante's small operation.

75
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,543
Things quickly grew for him

76
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:55,138
and my father became
more heavily involved.

77
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:59,083
No matter how hot things
got with the police,

78
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:01,033
nothing would stop Dante.

79
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,163
He just became more cocky and brazen,

80
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,446
brokering daylight drug
deals out in the open.

81
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:08,593
[gun fires]

82
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:09,845
The police took notice.

83
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:10,733
[gun fires]

84
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,563
But nothing stopped Dante.
[engine roars]

85
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:13,838
He just kept dealing.

86
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:19,698
To him, this was a way of
life, and he was loving life.

87
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,543
No matter what the police did,

88
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,403
Dante was always one step ahead.

89
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,623
He couldn't be touched.

90
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,478
Things were going perfectly for him.

91
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:36,308
At least, that's what
he thought, at the time.

92
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:40,203
[gun cocks]

93
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,680
Life was smooth sailing for Dante

94
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,688
and his little drug-dealing scheme,

95
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:49,213
except he had one small problem.

96
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,023
There was a cop, hot,

97
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,548
hot on his trail.

98
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:58,078
And that cop was Angela's partner.

99
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:01,983
Yep.

100
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,948
Little Angela was a cop, and
they were closing in on Dante.

101
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,413
[muffled radio chatter]

102
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,083
Dante was betrayed,

103
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,732
and it wasn't long before
it was lights-out...

104
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:14,233
[gun cocks]

105
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,418
For Officer Angela.

106
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,823
[gun fires]

107
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:23,223
Dante's father was outraged
at his sons indiscretions.

108
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:26,943
Dante had destroyed their
entire plan for a US operation,

109
00:06:26,945 --> 00:06:29,268
and his visa was about to expire.

110
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,103
A visa? Is that why you
were gonna get married?

111
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:34,883
[Jacqueline] Mm-hm. Exactly.

112
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,433
This immigration problem
left the door wide-open

113
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:39,073
for my father to move in.

114
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:42,153
Immediately, he began
supplying Dante with weapons,

115
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:43,833
man-power and money,

116
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,763
to ensure the success of his master plan.

117
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,743
By selling me to the Calivaris,

118
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:51,133
my father would guarantee
his place in the Cartel.

119
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,962
What kind of man is gonna
sell his daughter to a cartel?

120
00:06:54,964 --> 00:06:56,063
[Jacqueline chuckles]

121
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:59,593
And you're telling me there was
nothing you could have done?

122
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:00,613
You couldn't have walked away?

123
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:03,408
There wasn't someone
you could have gone to?

124
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,283
What about your mother? Where was she?

125
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,123
Couldn't she have helped
you with some of this?

126
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,463
[Jacqueline] Mom died several years ago.

127
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:11,298
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,725
[Jacqueline] It was only
me and Dad after that.

129
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,658
So there was nothing you
could have done? Nothing?

130
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,325
[Jacqueline] It's not like I didn't try.

131
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:28,520
[priest sighs]

132
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:30,210
[peaceful piano music]

133
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:32,812
[glass clinks]

134
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:37,282
To my fiance, who I
love, and who loves me.

135
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:39,372
[Man] Oh, too bad she ain't here.

136
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,957
[guests laugh]

137
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,373
So when is this going to happen?

138
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,323
It's going down tomorrow.

139
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,002
You are going to move it all?

140
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:10,078
But the wedding is at the end of the week.

141
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:15,313
I would never let this
interfere with the wedding.

142
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:17,308
This will only take a day or so.

143
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,023
We'll take it down to Salerno River

144
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,588
and out to the Hutchison Bay.

145
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:27,403
Why isn't my fiance
dining with us tonight?

146
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:30,038
She's ill. Lying up in her room.

147
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:33,116
Well, then I guess
I must go and see her.

148
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,963
[elevator dings]

149
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:42,263
Because, when I go, I want
everything set up right.

150
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:45,598
You won't lose me, but this
is the only way to get me.

151
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:53,545
Babe, listen, I gotta go.
[suspenseful music]

152
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,293
It would've been nice of you

153
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:59,763
to have joined us this evening.

154
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:00,708
I was sick.

155
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:04,238
It was rude.

156
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:11,697
Get dressed.

157
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,795
I don't want to.

158
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,024
Get dressed.

159
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:22,671
No.

160
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,552
[Dante] Get on your
fucking feet and get dressed!

161
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:29,221
[ominous music]

162
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,203
You will obey me.

163
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,655
Does it make you feel hard?

164
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:36,165
To beat up on a girl.

165
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:39,181
Do you like how it feels?

166
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:41,341
Does it make you feel strong?

167
00:09:41,343 --> 00:09:43,343
[moans]

168
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,454
[screams]

169
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,823
[thud]

170
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:56,130
I am so, so sorry that happened to you.

171
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:59,923
But rest assured, God
will wreak his vengeance

172
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,575
on those who attack his children.

173
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,245
Was this the first time that your fiance

174
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,539
displayed this kind of violence?

175
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,291
[Jacqueline] [chuckles]
No. It wasn't the first time.

176
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,073
But it was the last.

177
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,861
I had a plan to escape, but
I needed the help of Rick.

178
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,218
[sighs] Poor Rick.

179
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:21,508
Rick? Who's Rick?

180
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:26,404
[Jacqueline] [sighs]
Rick was the man I loved.

181
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:28,618
And he died.

182
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:30,538
Because of me.

183
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:41,434
[smooth jazz music]
[cards flick]

184
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:52,375
What's your bet?

185
00:10:53,517 --> 00:10:56,017
[chips clink]

186
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:00,938
What?

187
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,208
You know, we're all one of three people.

188
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,542
You're either who your
friends think you are,

189
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,794
who you think you are,
or who you really are.

190
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,683
It all came down to one thing.

191
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:18,768
Stack 'em up, push 'em in, roll the dice.

192
00:11:20,075 --> 00:11:20,908
Bourbon?

193
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:25,582
[whiskey trickles]

194
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,473
So what's your one thing?
What is it that drives you?

195
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:30,325
What do you want?

196
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:34,750
I met this girl with a problem.

197
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,538
- What kind of problem?
- A marriage problem.

198
00:11:39,785 --> 00:11:42,193
Well you're not married,
so it's not your problem.

199
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:43,028
Exactly.

200
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,678
- So what does she want?
- Out.

201
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,333
And what's the deal?

202
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,483
Simple plan. She needs out.

203
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:55,378
The score is easily mid to
upper-level seven digits.

204
00:11:57,235 --> 00:11:58,068
A move out?

205
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,733
So, why me?

206
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,735
I need someone who's been in the game.

207
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:07,833
I've been in the game,
and I've been in the can.

208
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:11,198
Now, I'm out. I risk my neck for no one.

209
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:15,678
Look.

210
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:21,108
If the girl was worth it,
then she is the score.

211
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:25,273
So, who is it? Who are these people?

212
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:30,223
Do you remember Nick
Carson or John Knight?

213
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:31,898
Excuse me?

214
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,272
Do you know who Jimmy Bombay is?

215
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:36,473
[ominous music]

216
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:37,306
You should know better than this!

217
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:38,803
What're you telling me this for?

218
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,193
This, this girl.

219
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:41,053
I don't wanna know about it!

220
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:42,810
- Jack!
- I don't wanna hear it!

221
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:44,183
- I don't wanna know about it!
- Jack, you don't understand.

222
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:45,300
I don't wanna hear it!

223
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:47,303
I don't wanna fuckin' know about it!

224
00:12:47,305 --> 00:12:48,698
Lock up before you leave!

225
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,874
I don't give a fuck, man!

226
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,320
[door slams]

227
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:00,483
[helicopter blades whir]

228
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:03,013
[Jacqueline] The years
in prison changed Ace.

229
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,409
He knew he couldn't go back to
his old life on the outside.

230
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,911
[sirens wail]

231
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,693
Once he was released,
Ace moved back to Miami

232
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,833
and started managing Club Reno,

233
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,833
where he made it a point to
avoid his old life of crime

234
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:21,843
and Jimmy Bombay, the
kingpin and mastermind

235
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,988
of the crime underworld in South Florida.

236
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,943
As Ace left Club Reno that night,

237
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:30,923
his anger grew at the very
thought of Jimmy Bombay.

238
00:13:30,925 --> 00:13:32,953
No matter how much time had gone by,

239
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:35,523
Ace's past continued to haunt him,

240
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:38,098
threatening to make itself known again.

241
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:42,538
And just like that, Ace
knew his past had found him.

242
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:47,558
Years before Ace had worked the
streets of Miami with Jimmy.

243
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,733
Together, they became partners

244
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:54,768
in what later became my
father's crime empire.

245
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,813
Despite their partnership,
a delicate balance of power

246
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:00,938
existed between my father and Ace.

247
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,691
One always trying to outdo the other.

248
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:07,313
[boat engine roars]

249
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:10,023
On one of their jobs,
Ace cut an unlucky break,

250
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,603
and was thrown in jail,

251
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:15,520
leaving my father to build
his vast criminal operation.

252
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,643
[boat engine roars]

253
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:20,093
My father ran a tight crew.

254
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:21,873
John Knight, his second Lieutenant,

255
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,713
oversaw the import of cocaine
from the Caribbean and weapons

256
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,908
from South America into my
father's South Florida territory.

257
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,453
Equally impressive was
the operation necessary

258
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,480
to move the weapons and cash.

259
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:38,482
[tires screech]
[car engine roars]

260
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:43,233
Nick Carson transported my father's assets

261
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,683
to the Grand Bahamas,
making bi-weekly trips

262
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,428
to deposit the money
into numbered accounts.

263
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:52,696
[plane engines roar]

264
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,098
[tires screech]

265
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:15,093
From the back alleyways of Little Havana,

266
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:17,038
to the Palm Beach social elite,

267
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:21,238
Bombay controlled all vice.

268
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,985
And I know your situation was dire, but,

269
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:33,448
didn't you have a plan and where
did Rick fit into all this?

270
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:35,633
[Jacqueline] Rick was my only way out,

271
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,673
and my father's plan was
to deposit the diamonds

272
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:40,893
and drug money that sold
my life to the Cartel

273
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:44,403
into his offshore bank
account the next morning.

274
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,443
I thought it was perfect.

275
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,888
As if they were playing
right into my hand.

276
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:51,653
The night before,

277
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:54,808
my father had all his most
trusted men prepare the shipment.

278
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:59,053
The diamonds were placed
in a small porcelain doll.

279
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:02,578
This was Dante's down payment
into my father's operation.

280
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,883
The money was sealed in
plastic, put into an ice chest,

281
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,063
and then frozen.

282
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:12,813
Both the diamonds and cash
were going to be smuggled

283
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:16,413
out of the country the next
morning on my father's yacht.

284
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,513
The journey from Miami to the Bahamas

285
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:22,058
was my best chance to
escape and gain my freedom.

286
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,493
It was my intention to
have Rick ambush the boat

287
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,313
with some internal help.

288
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:29,453
I knew not all my father's men were happy

289
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,843
with Dante's move into his empire,

290
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,643
and I was going to strike my father

291
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:36,363
from the very walls that protected him.

292
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:40,903
One of his trusted men was
working with me, on the inside.

293
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,983
It was a simple, but dangerous proposal.

294
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:47,123
But if my plan worked, I would escape,

295
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,788
and escape with Rick, and the diamonds.

296
00:16:51,062 --> 00:16:55,118
It was all on the line,
but it was all I had.

297
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,700
- How are we looking?
- Good.

298
00:16:57,702 --> 00:17:01,900
Mr. Calivari's package is
all packed and ready to go.

299
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,276
Good man.

300
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,013
Is that gonna be ready to go?

301
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,988
In the morning, cold and hard.

302
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,046
I need to have a word with you.

303
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,548
[tense music]

304
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,178
Make sure it's frozen, solid.

305
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,623
What do you need, Boss?

306
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,113
We've got everything riding on this.

307
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,698
I need it taken care of right!

308
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,148
Jimmy, I'll never forget
all that you've done for me.

309
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,838
You know you can count on me.

310
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,832
"Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord."

311
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:53,492
Nothing increases evil more
than fighting evil with evil.

312
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:56,828
You can only fight evil with good.

313
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,250
[Jacqueline] I know,
Father. You're right.

314
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,273
I know this first-hand.

315
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,725
So tell me about your plan.

316
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:06,809
Did it work?

317
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,193
[Jacqueline] [chuckles] No, Father.

318
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:11,452
The plan went dreadfully wrong.

319
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:17,239
[tense music]

320
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:22,073
Everything's set. The
money's on the boat.

321
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:24,318
We'll be able to get on
the way in a few minutes.

322
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,693
Is everything going as planned?

323
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,163
Your package is secure.

324
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,128
And as for yours?

325
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:42,133
I guess you could say
our assets are frozen.

326
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:44,897
Everything is in its place.

327
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,973
[Dante] Where do you think you're going?

328
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,473
Wherever I please.

329
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,023
Jacqueline!

330
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:50,938
I need some sun.

331
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:57,813
I think it would be best

332
00:18:57,815 --> 00:19:01,133
if I made some things
clear to my daughter.

333
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:04,803
That would be good. When
will you be returning?

334
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:08,446
This sort of business only
takes a day, day and a half.

335
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,983
Have a good trip, then.

336
00:19:09,985 --> 00:19:13,748
One that may begin the journey
of a great partnership.

337
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:25,498
[suspenseful music]
[boat engine revs]

338
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:37,146
[tense music]

339
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:59,903
We've moving at a good clip.

340
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,055
We should be in Grand
Bahamas by nightfall.

341
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:07,308
It's all out there.
The opportunity is now.

342
00:21:08,195 --> 00:21:12,658
And with Calivari, we can make it happen.

343
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:14,665
I'll be below deck.

344
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,910
[suspenseful music]

345
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:37,597
[boar engine buzzes]

346
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,775
Watch it. That step's a doozy.

347
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,539
[gun fires]
[dramatic music]

348
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,541
[guns fire rapidly]

349
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,811
[guns fire rapidly]

350
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:05,147
[guns fire rapidly]

351
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,987
[guns fires rapidly]

352
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,663
[water splashes]

353
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,631
[gun fires]
[man screams]

354
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:43,383
[water splashes]

355
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:52,293
[gun fires]

356
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:55,049
Jimmy, Jimmy! Come on, we
get outta here, it's an ambush!

357
00:22:55,051 --> 00:23:00,051
I know it's an ambush,
you idiot! Let's move!

358
00:23:00,472 --> 00:23:02,805
[gun fires]

359
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,913
[gun fires]

360
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,493
Get away from the girl!

361
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:44,136
Go ahead. Make your move.

362
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:45,836
Drop the weapon, or the girl-

363
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,558
- That is my daughter!

364
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,143
[Rick] Put the package on the ground

365
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,315
and drop your weapon, or the girl-

366
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:56,123
- Do you really want to play the endgame?

367
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,623
[gun cocks]

368
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:59,388
You already lost, old man.

369
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,012
Give them the package.

370
00:24:03,014 --> 00:24:03,847
Now!

371
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,430
[gun fires]
[dramatic music]

372
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:13,620
[water splashes]

373
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,955
[gun fires]

374
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,092
[water splashes]

375
00:24:19,094 --> 00:24:21,891
The package! The package!

376
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,726
Stop them immediately!

377
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,300
[water splashes]

378
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:08,126
[water splashes]

379
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,273
What is the meaning of this?

380
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:25,643
We were ambushed!

381
00:25:25,645 --> 00:25:28,850
How is that one man could
breach the security of four

382
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:30,993
and still escape with my package?

383
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:34,053
I was betrayed by a personal confidant.

384
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:36,913
One who dealt in my most intimate matters.

385
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,193
But he did not go after the money!

386
00:25:39,195 --> 00:25:41,733
The money was frozen
solid in an ice chest.

387
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:45,068
His objective was clearly
the package and nothing more.

388
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:48,333
Check the money again.

389
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,043
It's all there.

390
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,508
I said check it again!

391
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:57,183
And what has become of this man?

392
00:25:57,185 --> 00:25:58,743
He is dead.

393
00:25:58,745 --> 00:26:00,215
Then where is my package?

394
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:04,648
Are you okay?

395
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,658
I don't know. How's your package?

396
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:13,035
Is this what I deserve?

397
00:26:13,922 --> 00:26:18,922
My life, my freedom, my
citizenship is anything but free!

398
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:21,468
It comes at a price!

399
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:28,545
The fate of those who hold your package

400
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:32,418
will be the same as those
who have betrayed me.

401
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:40,075
[sullen orchestral music]

402
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:48,305

[lock clinks]

406
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:15,725
I was worried that you wouldn't come.

407
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,921
I always come.

408
00:27:17,923 --> 00:27:21,590
[brooding orchestral music]

409
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:29,123
Are you okay?

410
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,182
We'll find out in a minute.

411
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,853
You wanna tell me why
I risked my life for her

412
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,005
when all I want is you?

413
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:56,809
[porcelain smashes]
[diamonds clink]

414
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:58,411
You got me.

415
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:36,508
You are here for one reason.

416
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:42,018
We have been attacked by betrayal.

417
00:28:43,175 --> 00:28:44,782
And now we will defend.

418
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:48,147
Many questions remain!

419
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:52,363
[fly unzips]

420
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:55,023
But who is the lone gunman?

421
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,183
Well, I got a good look at this guy

422
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:57,793
when he got the shot off at me.

423
00:28:57,795 --> 00:29:01,203
If it's who I think it is,
he works at a bar downtown.

424
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,653
I've got people in
every hotel, restaurant,

425
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:06,443
club and bar from Miami to Tampa.

426
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,313
If he's here, we'll find him.

427
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:09,983
Yeah, but I think I recognize this guy.

428
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:12,648
He works at a club downtown called Reno.

429
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:16,451
[ominous music]

430
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:21,433
In Overtown?

431
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:22,685
Yeah, that's the place.

432
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:26,663
Isn't that...

433
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:27,608
Yes.

434
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:29,804
It is.

435
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:34,009
Well, I think it's time
we pay them a little visit.

436
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:36,761
[urinal flushes]

437
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:39,448
Let's go.

[smooth jazz music]

439
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,298
[Guard] Get out of my
way, cowboy. Fuck that shit.

[door creaks]

442
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:06,163
Are you the normal bartender here?

443
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:09,013
There is nothin' normal about this bar.

444
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,353
I'm looking for the regular bartender.

445
00:30:11,355 --> 00:30:14,693
A kid named Larson.
He's the man back here.

446
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:17,833
Well, I'm looking for the
guy who's normally here.

447
00:30:17,835 --> 00:30:19,933
Oh, I'm sorry, Rick ain't here,

448
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,553
and I don't know what to tell ya.

449
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,110
That's the wrong answer, son!

450
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,862
[glass shatters]

451
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:28,098
Can I help you?

452
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:33,533
We have business to
conduct with your bartender.

453
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:35,285
You have business with these men?

454
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,503
Well, my business is managing a bar.

455
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:41,203
So you'll have to take yours elsewhere.

456
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:42,038
Let's go.

457
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:53,644
[door opens]

[phone rings]

459
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:57,183
Yeah, Larson. First name Rick.

460
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:58,653
I want the name on right now.

461
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:00,563
If this guy so much as takes a piss,

462
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:02,065
I wanna know what color it is.

463
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:06,482
[car starts]

464
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,623
We got a 6 AM flight
out of Fort Lauderdale,

465
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,530
and by 10, we're in town
with all this behind us.

466
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:37,463
Chicago. Feels like a dream.

467
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:38,445
Why is that?

468
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:42,844
Not having to live in fear.

469
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:47,363
I'm sorry, can you stop for a moment?

470
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,665
Something's not adding up.

471
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:53,887
If your fiance controlled
this vast criminal empire,

472
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,682
what would possibly make you
think you'd be safe in Chicago?

473
00:31:57,684 --> 00:32:00,963
[Jacqueline] Oh, Chicago
wasn't our final destination.

474
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:03,283
I had a contact there that
would change the diamonds

475
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:06,398
into cash and smuggle us out
of the country to Canada.

476
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:10,643
From there, we could go anywhere, but,

477
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,438
first we had to escape Florida.

478
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:20,065
[suspenseful music]

479
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:23,983
[car doors slam]

480
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:35,673
Good evening, sir. May I help you?

481
00:32:35,675 --> 00:32:37,383
Yeah, you have a Rick
Larson staying here?

482
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:38,816
Uh, let me check, sir.

483
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,651
[keyboard clacks]

484
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,658
I'm sorry. There's no one
registered under than name.

485
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:50,098
They say he's not here.
What name is he under?

486
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:53,298
What?

487
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:55,586
You gotta be kidding me.

488
00:32:57,145 --> 00:32:58,863
How about a Jacqueline Bombay?

489
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:00,233
[Clerk] I'll check, sir.

490
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:03,068

[wine trickles]

492
00:33:13,384 --> 00:33:15,634
Why'd you do this for me?

493
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:21,198
'Cause in life, there's
that one thing that drives us.

494
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:24,432
And you're it.

You're just like your mother!

What do you think this is? A game?

501
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:41,643
You're not gonna walk
away that easy, sister!

502
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,544
You wanna bet?

and take a look at this.

Do you have him?

Excellent.

532
00:35:39,092 --> 00:35:41,342
You know where to take him.

533
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,397
What kind of a problem?

00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:49,232

This situation is very bad.

She is working against you,

539
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:08,673
the wedding and the whole
operation with Dante Calivari.

540
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:10,223
She was behind the boat heist

541
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:13,523
and orchestrated the theft
of the Calivari diamonds.

542
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,603
Worst off, she has been plotting all this

543
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:19,313
right under our noses, working
against us from the start.

544
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:21,063
I feel that if she escapes,

545
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:23,365
it would jeopardize our
plans with the cartel.

546
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,958
The time to act is now, Jimmy.

547
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:28,845
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.

548
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:39,136
[birds tweet]
[engines roar]

549
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:51,594
[suspenseful music]

550
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,698
We are going to have a little talk.

551
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,117
[tape tears]

552
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,782
Where is my fiance?

553
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,063
We can talk all night long,

554
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:37,265
but I'm never gonna say
what you wanna hear.

555
00:37:38,698 --> 00:37:41,115
[tape tears]

556
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,823
This is not an
intellectual conversation.

557
00:37:52,825 --> 00:37:55,148
This is where you end and I begin.

558
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,733
She ended you a long time ago.

559
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,568
Fuck you!

560
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:02,523
End comes to us all.

561
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:05,638
It is what we do in the face
of defeat that defines us.

562
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,283
Where are my diamonds?

563
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,723
I unloaded them for cash.

564
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:10,783
Impossible. You couldn't have.

565
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,172
Why is that?

566
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:13,923
Because when I found you, you smart ass,

567
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,418
you had no cash on you.

568
00:38:16,515 --> 00:38:18,778
Yeah, but my girlfriend does.

569
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:22,578
[Dante grunts]

570
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,168
[bullet clacks]

571
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,837
[barrel clicks]

572
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:49,773
What is your name?

573
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:52,123
The name's Larson.

574
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,593
Rick Larson.

575
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:54,463
Tell me, Mr. Larson.

576
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,553
What do you know of a club called Reno?

577
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:57,473
That's the wrong question.

578
00:38:57,475 --> 00:39:01,623
The answer is "what do you
wanna know about Club Reno?"

579
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:02,908
Rick Larson.

580
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,888
John Knight.

581
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,638
But the only name I really
need to hear is one.

582
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:24,954
Jack Black.

583
00:39:24,956 --> 00:39:27,706
[brooding music]

584
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,753
No.

585
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:34,755
I offered it to him.

586
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:38,153
- He didn't wanna know of it.
- I don't believe you.

587
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:39,613
I'm telling you the truth.

588
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:40,588
You lie!

589
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:45,123
Jack Black plays the game,
but he wouldn't play you.

590
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,363
Why? I don't know.

591
00:39:46,365 --> 00:39:48,183
What do you know of this man?

592
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,133
He's managed the Club
Reno for six years come June

593
00:39:50,135 --> 00:39:52,153
and before that, he was in Glades for 14.

594
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:53,583
He likes to drink and play cards,

595
00:39:53,585 --> 00:39:55,563
both of which he does on a nightly basis.

596
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:57,093
He has no friends and no family,

597
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,063
and when I offered him the job,

598
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,683
he threw a glass of bourbon at my head.

599
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:02,168
To me, that said a resounding no.

600
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:04,795
What did you say?

601
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:06,658
He said no.

602
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:09,878
What did he throw at your head?

603
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:11,898
Bourbon.

604
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:18,945
I want to know the truth.

605
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:23,185
Where is Jacqueline?

606
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:26,908
Gone.

607
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:31,085
[laughs]

608
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:35,828
Mr. Larson.

609
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:40,288
It is you who can articulate your fate.

610
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:43,678
Speak or face the music.

611
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,498
Let's dance.

612
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:56,718
[thud]
[groans]

613
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,637
[gasoline swashes]

614
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:03,483
[gasoline splashes]
[spits]

615
00:41:03,485 --> 00:41:05,695
My fate lies in this wedding!

616
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,976
He's gonna face the music!

617
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:09,547
Speak!

618
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:12,299
Speak! Speak, or you want to die?

619
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,369
[Rick coughs]

620
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:27,618
[Rick spits]

621
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:32,022
[Rick spits]

622
00:41:38,002 --> 00:41:41,002
[gasoline splashes]

623
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:48,354
[Rick coughs]

624
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:56,152
[gasoline trickles]

625
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:02,073
My father will be in tomorrow.

626
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:03,326
If you cannot produce the girl,

627
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:06,212
then we will have to take
our business elsewhere.

628
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:16,994
[gasoline trickles]

629
00:42:16,996 --> 00:42:20,413
[tense percussive music]

630
00:42:32,108 --> 00:42:34,608
[flames hiss]

631
00:42:37,132 --> 00:42:42,132
[explosion roars]
[ominous music]

632
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:08,313
[distant waves crash]

633
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:09,843
With the word of Rick's death,

634
00:43:09,845 --> 00:43:13,287
I knew it was only time
before the endgame.

635
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:15,956
[ominous music]

636
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,548
Jacqueline must be found.

637
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:30,553
I think it would be best if
we ran the financial records.

638
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:33,703
Credit cards, bank accounts,
the whole spectrum.

639
00:43:33,705 --> 00:43:37,558
Time is of the essence.
Calivari's coming undone.

640
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:41,823
What do we know about your girl?

641
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:44,403
She's got an airline
ticket and she's well-funded.

642
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:47,548
The question isn't if
she'll turn up, but when.

643
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,095
And who can bring her home.

644
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:55,828
I got a name for you, but
you're not gonna like it.

645
00:43:57,655 --> 00:43:58,538
Jack Black.

646
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:00,578
Ace?

647
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:06,173
We need someone who's on
the other side of the coin,

648
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:07,763
and he's not behind it.

649
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:08,958
But he could undo it.

650
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:11,348
Why him?

651
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:15,298
Motivation.

652
00:44:16,505 --> 00:44:17,568
That, she is.

653
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:26,815
Tell him an old debt will
be paid upon his arrival.

654
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:28,998
Make the call.

655
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:42,195
[clock ticks]
[distant waves crash]

656
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:45,197
[suspenseful music]

657
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:10,578
Checkmate.

658
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:13,798
I have a job for you.

659
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:18,243
One of a unique, personal interest.

660
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:20,073
I have no interest.

661
00:45:20,075 --> 00:45:21,888
I'm here to get my money and leave.

662
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,173
I think you're gonna
have to take an interest.

663
00:45:26,175 --> 00:45:27,554
I'm out of the game.

664
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:30,193
I'm not interested in making a comeback.

665
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,113
I've been out of the
can six years come June.

666
00:45:32,115 --> 00:45:34,158
Haven't seen you in about 20.

667
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:37,875
There's no way I'm going out on the line.

668
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:48,308
Your daughter?

669
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:53,653
Yes, it's Jacqueline.

670
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:55,153
She's engaged.

671
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,313
That's lovely.

672
00:45:56,315 --> 00:45:57,813
What am I doing here?

673
00:45:57,815 --> 00:46:01,003
Her wedding is in three
days to Dante Calivari.

674
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:03,863
The Russian who's been
importing for me ever since-

675
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:06,263
- The diamond cartel's man, so
why are you telling me this?

676
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:09,183
Things are very bad overseas.

677
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:13,153
It is paramount that Calivari
comes to this country

678
00:46:13,155 --> 00:46:14,678
and weds Jacqueline.

679
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:19,833
No doubt you understand the implications.

680
00:46:19,835 --> 00:46:21,658
If these two come together,

681
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:24,528
the game is not over.

682
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,763
There are moves still to be made.

683
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,448
Not by me. I risk my neck for nobody.

684
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,898
Jacqueline is missing.

685
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:37,897
[suspenseful music]

686
00:46:40,825 --> 00:46:42,475
What do you mean she's missing?

687
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,433
She's run away.

688
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:46,268
Where?

689
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:48,748
Chicago.

690
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:51,743
What the hell is she doing there?

691
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:53,258
Avoiding holy matrimony.

692
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:57,703
Princess is a spoiled little brat.

693
00:46:57,705 --> 00:47:00,493
This is business for Calivari.

694
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:01,778
Life and death.

695
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:05,153
He's wanted for a car bombing.

696
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:05,988
In Dublin.

697
00:47:08,475 --> 00:47:10,883
You may have left the game,

698
00:47:10,885 --> 00:47:13,668
but you still know all the players.

699
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:16,653
What do you want me to do?

700
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:18,483
You have three days.

701
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:20,173
You need to track Jacqueline down

702
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:22,103
and bring her back to this wedding.

703
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,853
Don't tell me what I need.

704
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:26,573
What I need and what you want
are very different things.

705
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:28,653
If you don't track her
down and bring her back here

706
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:31,263
in three days, then somebody
else is going to have to

707
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,933
bring her back in a much
less pleasant manner.

708
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,738
This isn't as easy as you think.

709
00:47:37,935 --> 00:47:40,443
Don't underestimate her. She's smart.

710
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:41,845
She comes from good stock.

711
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:51,808
So how's, uh, Marilyn?

712
00:47:53,555 --> 00:47:54,648
My wife is dead.

713
00:47:56,515 --> 00:47:57,988
Six years, come June.

714
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:02,508
I'd like you to meet Lou Bishop.

715
00:48:03,535 --> 00:48:05,728
This is an old friend of mine.

716
00:48:07,075 --> 00:48:08,008
Ace.

717
00:48:11,015 --> 00:48:13,238
Your reputation precedes you, Ace.

718
00:48:14,145 --> 00:48:15,523
[Jack] Reputations are only as good

719
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,048
as those who pass them on.

720
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:19,188
And you can call me Jack.

721
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:22,473
Lou's one of my best.

722
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:24,578
For the right price, he'd do anyone.

723
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:26,648
Or anything.

724
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:28,518
Is that so?

725
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:31,633
I'm a businessman, Ace.

726
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:34,303
[Jack] Then conduct yourself like one.

727
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:36,623
You take care of business your way,

728
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,263
and I'll take care of business my way.

729
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:41,348
Ace's business is in Chicago.

730
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:44,683
A family matter,

731
00:48:44,685 --> 00:48:47,273
that I'm sure he would want
to take care of himself,

732
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,908
rather than anyone else.

733
00:48:51,485 --> 00:48:53,435
Then let's finish these arrangements.

734
00:48:56,694 --> 00:49:00,361
[distant plane engine hums]

735
00:49:07,205 --> 00:49:09,414
[dramatic music]
[horn blares]

736
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,673
[phone rings]

737
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:13,263
Yeah, Jerry. Jerry Burton.

738
00:49:13,265 --> 00:49:14,803
It's me, Jack Black.

739
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:17,183
Listen, I need a credit card run.

740
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:18,493
Right.

741
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:19,908
Bombay. Jacqueline.

742
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:24,643
Wait, wait, wait. Did
you make your contact?

743
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:28,033
Because obviously you became
a thief just like they are.

744
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:28,866
I mean, why are you here?

745
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:29,886
Do you want me to absolve you of this sin?

746
00:49:29,888 --> 00:49:31,108
Is that what you want?

747
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:33,483
[Jacqueline] Not exactly.

748
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:35,833
With Rick's death, our timeline changed.

749
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:38,303
My contact was out of
town until the next day.

750
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,433
So, I was stranded.

751
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,183
I knew Dante's father was
coming in for the wedding.

752
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:45,152
My time was running out.

753
00:49:45,154 --> 00:49:46,782
Your time was running out.

754
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,277
[sighs] Oh, okay.

755
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:56,908
Keep in touch from the
moment you get there.

756
00:49:58,555 --> 00:50:00,090
No problem.

757
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:02,842
[water splashes]

758
00:50:11,652 --> 00:50:14,069
[dark music]

759
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,743
See Jimmy Bombay. Now, bring him.

760
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:22,838
He's coming, Papa.

761
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:24,828
He's coming.

762
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:28,528
Dante Sr.

763
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,033
It's so good to see you.

764
00:50:32,035 --> 00:50:35,008
Jimmy, if you would please take a seat.

765
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:36,866
Sit, sit.

766
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:42,883
Are your accommodations
to your specifications?

767
00:50:42,885 --> 00:50:44,118
Everything is fine.

768
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:46,963
We need to speak.

769
00:50:46,965 --> 00:50:49,573
It's very important to
me that my only son Dante

770
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:52,558
come to this country to
begin here a new life.

771
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:56,063
Because you provide this for me,

772
00:50:56,065 --> 00:50:59,038
I have great gratitude
and appreciation for you.

773
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:03,893
But, where is this girl that
I'm soon to call my daughter?

774
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:06,598
I have to your home,
yet I have not met her.

775
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,218
And I want to know why.

776
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,146
[distant boat horn blows]

777
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:13,648
[tense music]

778
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:19,503
Seen this girl around anywhere?

779
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:20,968
Look familiar? No?

780
00:51:22,025 --> 00:51:24,489
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen
this girl around anywhere?

781
00:51:24,491 --> 00:51:25,467
I sure haven't, sir.

782
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:27,118
Are you sure she doesn't look familiar?

783
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,369
- No, I haven't, sir.
- You're sure?

784
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:30,121
No, sir. I haven't.

785
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:37,019
Does she look familiar to you?

786
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:39,370
You seen this girl by any
chance? She look familiar to you?

787
00:51:39,372 --> 00:51:41,838
You seen this girl by any
chance? Look familiar to you?

788
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,787
Seen her around? No?

789
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:44,667
Look familiar?

790
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:47,086
[horn horns]

791
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:52,783
[faint dance music]

792
00:51:52,785 --> 00:51:53,618
I like it.

793
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:57,213
I'll take it.

794
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:59,108
Yeah, it looks great on you!

795
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:06,433
[tense music]

796
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:07,936
[Jacqueline] Thank you.

797
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:08,955
[phone bleeps]

798
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:09,790
Hello?

799
00:52:11,316 --> 00:52:12,149
What?

800
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:14,898
She used a credit card where?

801
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:18,443
What's the name of it?
Give me the address!

802
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:19,648
Oaken, Michigan. Got it!

803
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:22,605
Oaken, Michigan. Got it!

804
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:25,674
Oaken, Michigan!

805
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:26,593
Yes, sir!

806
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:37,735
I realize that your father
and Ace were close in the past.

807
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,033
[Jacqueline] Mm-hm.

808
00:52:39,035 --> 00:52:41,803
But it seems strange that
your father would send Ace

809
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:44,208
to look for you and bring you back home.

810
00:52:45,685 --> 00:52:46,727
[Jacqueline] Well, at that time,

811
00:52:46,729 --> 00:52:48,529
I didn't even know that Ace existed.

812
00:52:49,638 --> 00:52:52,238
But when Ace was working
the streets with my father,

813
00:52:53,485 --> 00:52:55,435
he got very close to my mother as well.

814
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,958
Your mother. Tell me about her.

815
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,290
Were you close with her?

816
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,223
[screeching]
[suspenseful music]

817
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:07,133
[Jacqueline] My mother and father

818
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:08,728
were constantly in battle.

819
00:53:12,595 --> 00:53:14,843
Mom was getting fed up
being the trophy wife to a

820
00:53:14,845 --> 00:53:17,445
power-hungry coke dealer
who only wanted more power.

821
00:53:20,605 --> 00:53:21,908
It wasn't always this way.

822
00:53:22,745 --> 00:53:24,173
When they met, Mom had just stopped

823
00:53:24,175 --> 00:53:25,688
a successful modeling career.

824
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:30,706
Dad promised her the
world, and for a while...

825
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,353
[glass shatters]
They had a great life.

826
00:53:33,355 --> 00:53:35,738
At some point, she
wanted to start a family.

827
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,538
By then, Dad was barely
interested in Mom, let alone kids.

828
00:53:43,405 --> 00:53:46,503
I think it was when things
with my father got really tough

829
00:53:46,505 --> 00:53:50,988
that she turned to Ace.
[smooth jazz music]

830
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,368
[Marilyn] What are you drinking?

831
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:08,135
[Jack] My problems away.

832
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:10,328
Is it working?

833
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:14,855
I don't think it ever really works.

834
00:54:15,736 --> 00:54:17,153
May I sit down?

835
00:54:34,462 --> 00:54:36,512
You know, your face is a contradiction.

836
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,605
And why is that?

837
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:42,988
Your face is too pretty
to have eyes so sad.

838
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:46,038
Oaken, Michigan?

839
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:48,558
Oaken, Michigan, sir?

840
00:54:51,165 --> 00:54:52,418
Oaken, Michigan, sir?

841
00:54:53,706 --> 00:54:56,706
[faint dance music]

842
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:03,934
Have you seen this girl?

843
00:55:08,685 --> 00:55:09,518
Why?

844
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:12,035
Well, she's my...

845
00:55:13,305 --> 00:55:15,493
She's my... She's my daughter.

846
00:55:15,495 --> 00:55:16,885
Came here to buy her a birthday present.

847
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:19,485
She was supposed to meet me
here. She's nowhere to be found.

848
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:20,958
[chuckles] Sorry.

849
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:23,723
I don't like being sorry.

850
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:25,138
That's your business.

851
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:27,673
You like business?

852
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:29,603
No. Pleasure.

853
00:55:29,605 --> 00:55:32,118
Well, it would please me
if you could cut the shit.

854
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:36,175
Now, have you seen this girl or not?

855
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:42,793
Yeah.

856
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:44,593
About an hour ago.

857
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:45,823
She bought heels and a skirt,

858
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:48,625
then she went over to the
coffee shop across the street.

859
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:50,798
- Thanks.
- Hm.

860
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:00,193
Hey, I didn't know you were still here.

861
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:01,528
Someone's looking for you.

862
00:56:06,226 --> 00:56:08,643
[dark music]

863
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:15,903
Jimmy, where is my fiance?

864
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,338
She's an emotional girl. You know that.

865
00:56:19,425 --> 00:56:23,323
She just needed a little rest.
A little breather, that's it.

866
00:56:23,325 --> 00:56:24,583
She'll be back.

867
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:26,513
I see it is in your best interest

868
00:56:26,515 --> 00:56:28,053
to take control of your house!

869
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:30,448
Just remember whose
house you're standing in.

870
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:34,233
[Dante spits]

871
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:36,880
My daughter is going to
be a good wife to you.

872
00:56:36,882 --> 00:56:39,903
You speak on behalf of
your daughter with arrogance,

873
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:42,873
but I do not share this
arrogant point of view!

874
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,978
I don't speak on behalf of anyone.

875
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:47,938
I speak for everyone.

876
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,375
And I'm sure you only want
what is best for Jacqueline.

877
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:55,758
And what is best for business.

878
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:01,880

[Clerk] Hi, may I help you?

883
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,564
It's the right quality,
these are very nice.

884
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:39,649
What are you looking for?

885

887
00:57:57,814 --> 00:57:59,231
This will work.

[door closes]

891
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,018
What can I do for ya?

892
00:58:22,185 --> 00:58:24,313
Oh, I seem to have lost
something and the problem is,

893
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:25,515
I can't seem to find it.

894
00:58:30,725 --> 00:58:32,475
- What're you drinkin'?
- Bourbon.

895
00:58:38,617 --> 00:58:42,143
You know, a man can
get killed doing that.

896
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:43,836
Drinking bourbon?

897
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:45,505
Looking for girls.

898
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,365
So what does she look like?

899
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,786
[chuckles]

900
00:58:56,788 --> 00:58:58,186
What?

901
00:58:58,188 --> 00:59:01,097
Now, some guy was in
here looking for some girl

902
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:03,707
with the same description.

903
00:59:03,709 --> 00:59:06,828
"Tall and dark hair, long legs."

904
00:59:09,085 --> 00:59:10,180
Who? What're you talkin' about?

905
00:59:10,182 --> 00:59:12,163
Was it the same girl?

906
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:13,583
Listen, buddy.

907
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:15,253
Guys like you come in here,

908
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:18,693
looking for girls like that, every day.

909
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:23,038
I ain't seen your
girlfriend, hooker or wife.

910
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:25,598
Daughter.

911
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,335
I ain't seen her, either.

912
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:34,098
[bell rings]

913
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,322
[traffic hums]

914
00:59:44,587 --> 00:59:48,004
[faint blues rock music]

915
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:52,673
Checking in, sir?

916
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:54,985
The name's Black. Jack Black.

917
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:57,183
And are you traveling alone?

918
00:59:57,185 --> 00:59:59,713
I find that's the only way to travel.

919
00:59:59,715 --> 01:00:01,865
And how long will
you be staying with us?

920
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:04,873
No more than two nights.

921
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:07,278
Okay. We'll need a major credit card.

922
01:00:09,765 --> 01:00:12,473
How much would you be
putting on that card?

923
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,308
Excuse me?

924
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:16,803
I said how much would you be
putting on that credit card?

925
01:00:16,805 --> 01:00:19,368
Well, your room is 569 a night.

926
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:21,628
Plus expenses.

927
01:00:24,635 --> 01:00:26,443
I don't use credit cards,

928
01:00:26,445 --> 01:00:29,003
because, frankly, I don't
think anybody should know

929
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:32,258
exactly where you are at
every minute of the day.

930
01:00:33,206 --> 01:00:35,461
[horns blare]

931
01:00:35,463 --> 01:00:37,981
[phone rings]

932
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:41,313
[phone rings]

933
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:42,413
Yeah.

934
01:00:42,415 --> 01:00:43,873
How are you doin'?

935
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:45,112
Gettin' close.

936
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:46,443
[suspenseful music]
[heartbeat thuds]

937
01:00:46,445 --> 01:00:48,043
Where are you?

938
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,473
Coming from the north side.

939
01:00:50,475 --> 01:00:51,778
Time's running out.

940
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:54,335
I hope you don't, too.

941
01:00:55,975 --> 01:00:57,453
I'm not worried.

942
01:00:57,455 --> 01:00:58,528
Keep in touch!

943
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,907
[phone bleeps]

944
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,080
[brooding music]

945
01:01:21,785 --> 01:01:24,643
What if you blew off your next heist,

946
01:01:24,645 --> 01:01:26,839
and we could take off together?

947
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:29,718
I don't think your husband
would like traveling in threes.

948
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:33,978
You know I can't take much
more of this. I need you.

949
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,158
His temper is going to kill me.

950
01:01:39,345 --> 01:01:41,599
You only need one last score.

951
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:43,933
[cork pops]

952
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:44,938
Make this one it.

953
01:01:45,955 --> 01:01:46,788
Bet on me.

954
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,875
How do you know what I need?

955
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,788
Because I give it to you.

956
01:01:54,022 --> 01:01:56,992
I'll give it all up for
you, baby, but not now.

957
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:00,116
When?

958
01:02:00,118 --> 01:02:02,553
This is it. One for the road.

959
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:04,055
And then it's just you and me.

960
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:19,431
Are my cuff links still on that shirt?

961
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:20,266
No.

962
01:02:21,513 --> 01:02:23,263
Good. Then keep it.

963
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:31,824
Are you gonna be okay here tonight?

964
01:02:34,995 --> 01:02:37,878
Yeah. He won't be back
until the morning anyway.

965
01:02:44,484 --> 01:02:46,108
[sighs] Be careful.

966
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,382
[door opens]

967
01:02:52,463 --> 01:02:55,130

968
01:02:56,963 --> 01:02:59,463
[door closes]

969
01:03:03,933 --> 01:03:06,600
[ominous tones]

970
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:12,603
[lighter flicks]

971
01:03:13,965 --> 01:03:15,713
In life, there are games of luck,

972
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:17,238
and there are games of skill.

973
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:19,363
But the greatest skill of all

974
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:22,498
is having a lifelong supply of luck.

975
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:27,622
The problem is, I knew
mine was about to run out.

976
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:49,658
[horns honk]
[traffic hums]

977

01:04:07,048 --> 01:04:09,798
[brooding music]

981
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,847
What if I were to make
you a deal, Jack Black?

982
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,829
[gun cocks]

983
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:24,928
[groans]

984
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,156
Hello, Jacqueline.

985
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,742
And you can call me Ace.

986
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,977
[Jacqueline] Do you work for my fiance?

987
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:45,113
So how did you know my name?

988
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,815
The same way I got in your room.

989
01:04:49,555 --> 01:04:51,173
I work for no one.

990
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:52,398
Room service, please.

991
01:04:56,065 --> 01:04:58,018
But I was hired by Jimmy Bombay.

992
01:04:59,975 --> 01:05:00,925
[Jacqueline] Why?

993
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:06,873
Well, think about when
you first got engaged,

994
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:09,158
and ask yourself why you did that.

995
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:12,205
Because I like money, but...

996
01:05:13,345 --> 01:05:15,978
Hello? Yes, I'd like to
a bottle of Dom Perignon.

997
01:05:18,275 --> 01:05:19,773
Room num...

998
01:05:19,775 --> 01:05:21,349
Right, thank you.

999
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:22,493
[phone clacks]

1000
01:05:22,495 --> 01:05:25,045
Money's useless, if you're
not alive to spend it.

1001
01:05:26,525 --> 01:05:28,125
Do you think I'm about to die?

1002
01:05:30,545 --> 01:05:32,395
I don't think you've begun to live.

1003
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:40,985
And what if I were to
make you a proposition?

1004
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:44,995
Usually, I'm on the other
side of that question mark.

1005
01:05:47,045 --> 01:05:49,895
I have one chance to get
away from my father and Dante,

1006
01:05:50,765 --> 01:05:54,103
and since this marriage
is till death do us part,

1007
01:05:54,105 --> 01:05:55,555
here is the play I need.

1008
01:05:57,805 --> 01:05:59,105
You want me to kill you?

1009
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,028
Or so it will appear.

1010
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:06,068
Not interested.

1011
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:09,673
- What are you doing?
- Calling your father.

1012
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,225
No, please don't call my dad!

1013
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:14,348
Sorry.

1014
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:16,678
I'll kill myself.

1015
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:22,275
[phone rings]

1016
01:06:22,277 --> 01:06:25,383
In life, there are
players and there are pawns.

1017
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:27,235
It's up to you how you play the game.

1018
01:06:29,837 --> 01:06:34,837
[phone rings]
[suspenseful music]

1019
01:06:35,197 --> 01:06:36,896
[phone rings]

1020
01:06:36,898 --> 01:06:40,133
[phone bleeps]

1021
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:42,728
I have money! Name your
price and it's yours.

1022
01:06:45,475 --> 01:06:46,768
Jimmy, I got her.

1023
01:06:48,085 --> 01:06:48,918
Where?

1024
01:06:49,935 --> 01:06:51,433
I got her in my room right now.

1025
01:06:51,435 --> 01:06:53,768
[gun cocks]

1026
01:06:54,985 --> 01:06:56,273
Uh...

1027
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:57,393
I gotta go.

1028
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:59,743
I gotta go. I'll call you back later.

1029
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:00,695
I'll call you back.

1030
01:07:04,135 --> 01:07:04,968
What's this?

1031
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:07,568
Me making my move.

1032
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:12,083
You don't understand. I'm
a prisoner of my mistakes.

1033
01:07:12,085 --> 01:07:13,448
But I know you can do this.

1034
01:07:19,675 --> 01:07:22,476
Son of a gun. He pulled it off.

1035
01:07:22,478 --> 01:07:23,933
You know who Jimmy Bombay is?

1036
01:07:23,935 --> 01:07:27,833
The score is easily mid to
upper-level seven digits.

1037
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,385
It sets the table for her
to make a permanent move.

1038
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,328
Name your price and it's yours.

1039
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:38,383
As I said, money is useless,

1040
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:39,985
if you're not alive to spend it.

1041
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:46,338
We all die, but how many
of us can say we truly lived?

1042
01:07:50,055 --> 01:07:50,973
Look, why don't you put that gun away

1043
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:52,268
before you hurt yourself?

1044
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:57,585
Frankly, your money and your
problems don't interest me.

1045
01:08:04,315 --> 01:08:05,148
Do I?

1046
01:08:07,502 --> 01:08:10,169
[Jack chuckles]

1047
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,672
You know, he raped me.

1048
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,178
My fiance?

1049
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,413
He raped me.

1050
01:08:19,415 --> 01:08:21,648
Or did my father forget to tell you that?

1051
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:27,403
Your father indicated
that you had a chance

1052
01:08:27,405 --> 01:08:30,903
to say yes or no, and you said yes.

1053
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:33,688
At first he was a nice
guy who treated me right.

1054
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:37,463
You mean, he spent money on you.

1055
01:08:37,465 --> 01:08:39,665
Yeah, that too. So
why wouldn't I say yes?

1056
01:08:42,335 --> 01:08:44,533
And then suddenly he raped you?

1057
01:08:44,535 --> 01:08:47,432
We were in London when
Dad went to business

1058
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:50,008
and we went out with a
couple of his friends.

1059
01:08:51,684 --> 01:08:54,388
I had a little too much
to drink that night and...

1060
01:08:56,898 --> 01:08:59,756
I ended up in his hotel room,

1061
01:08:59,758 --> 01:09:02,423
where he asked me to go
down on one of his friends,

1062
01:09:02,425 --> 01:09:04,675
and when I wouldn't do
it, Dante got furious.

1063
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,157
[sobs]

1064
01:09:10,055 --> 01:09:11,104
But I wouldn't do it.

1065
01:09:14,755 --> 01:09:18,024
So Dante took out his revolver

1066
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:22,348
and he raped me with it. [sobs]

1067
01:09:25,482 --> 01:09:27,108
Did Jimmy know about this?

1068
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:31,713
I was hospitalized for a week

1069
01:09:31,715 --> 01:09:33,854
and I couldn't walk for three more.

1070
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:41,632
Get your things together
and leave right now!

1071
01:09:41,634 --> 01:09:43,884
I can't help you, but
I won't come after you!

1072
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:49,268
Do you think my dad
would ever let that happen?

1073
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:57,440
Oh, I don't think you'll have
to worry about your father.

1074
01:10:00,165 --> 01:10:02,534
[knocks]
What's that?

1075
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:04,369
I ordered champagne.

1076
01:10:06,574 --> 01:10:09,574
[suspenseful music]

1077
01:10:18,059 --> 01:10:20,643
Did somebody order champagne?

1078
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,550
[gun cocks]

1079
01:10:24,552 --> 01:10:26,693
Mr. Bombay is grateful for your services,

1080
01:10:26,695 --> 01:10:28,087
but you're no longer needed.

1081
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:30,125
Get away from me!

1082
01:10:30,127 --> 01:10:32,178
[phone rings]

1083
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,498
[phone rings]

1084
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,063
Get your hands off me!

1085
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,923
Jimmy! What the hell is going on here?

1086
01:10:37,925 --> 01:10:39,393
Checkmate!

1087
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:41,682
Sometimes when all the
pieces are lined up,

1088
01:10:41,684 --> 01:10:44,168
the only thing left to
do is to make your move.

1089
01:10:45,305 --> 01:10:48,818
I had to make sure that my
little princess would get home.

1090
01:10:49,865 --> 01:10:51,583
You used me!

1091
01:10:51,585 --> 01:10:54,645
I used your move against
you. That's the game!

1092
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:57,628
[Jacqueline yelps]

1093
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,714
[laughs]

1094
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,563
[phone bleeps]

1095
01:11:05,151 --> 01:11:07,651
[tense music]

1096
01:11:12,175 --> 01:11:14,143
Get your hands off me! [whines]

1097
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,973
Get your hands off of her,

1098
01:11:15,975 --> 01:11:19,233
or I'll spray your brains across the wall!

1099
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:21,168
Do you understand me perfectly?

1100
01:11:22,721 --> 01:11:25,198
She's coming home with me!

1101
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,282
I'm not going anywhere without Ace!

1102
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,505
[car starts]

1103
01:11:40,489 --> 01:11:43,239
[car door opens]

1104
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:52,874
[tires screech]

1105
01:12:00,777 --> 01:12:03,777
[suspenseful music]

1106
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,327
[chuckles] Daddy.

1107
01:12:14,116 --> 01:12:15,523
[yelps]

1108
01:12:15,525 --> 01:12:17,893
Get inside and go upstairs!

1109
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:21,533
You are gettin' married in the morning.

1110
01:12:21,535 --> 01:12:22,983
Did she have it on her?

1111
01:12:22,985 --> 01:12:26,123
When I found her, she didn't
have much of anything on her.

1112
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:26,998
She's clean.

1113
01:12:30,065 --> 01:12:33,045
The son of a bitch flushed it.

1114
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,714
[ominous music]

1115
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:03,297
[lock clicks]

1116
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:24,237
[water splashes]

1117
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,748
[dramatic music]

1118
01:13:44,668 --> 01:13:46,633
I go in hard with a bang.

1119
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:49,073
I'll keep the sheep at bay
while you take the vault.

1120
01:13:49,075 --> 01:13:50,393
I'll clean out the vault below

1121
01:13:50,395 --> 01:13:52,703
and blow the locks off the safe.

1122
01:13:52,705 --> 01:13:56,243
If it doesn't blow, I'll hand off to you,

1123
01:13:56,245 --> 01:13:58,610
and you clean out the rest
of the cash in the vault.

1124
01:13:58,612 --> 01:14:01,038
If the safe doesn't
blow, it's not worth it.

1125
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:04,053
We'd be vulnerable at the hand-off.

1126
01:14:04,055 --> 01:14:06,483
The pendulum could swing right there.

1127
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:08,085
I mean, is this really worth it?

1128
01:14:10,594 --> 01:14:12,503
What are you thinking?

1129
01:14:12,505 --> 01:14:14,548
You know this is the right move!

1130
01:14:17,605 --> 01:14:19,833
It's not a move, it's a gamble.

1131
01:14:19,835 --> 01:14:21,393
But sometimes you have to stack 'em up,

1132
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:22,928
push 'em in and roll the dice.

1133
01:14:31,002 --> 01:14:33,603
400,000. We have 400,000.

1134
01:14:33,605 --> 01:14:36,313
We're looking for 400,000.

1135
01:14:36,315 --> 01:14:39,705
Ah, I have 400,000. Can we get 410,000?

1136
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:42,643
410,000. We have 410,000.

1137
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,923
Looking for 420,000. 420,000.

1138
01:14:45,925 --> 01:14:47,123
Do we have 420?

1139
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:48,383
[Guard] Can I help you?

1140
01:14:48,385 --> 01:14:50,563
I'm here to make a bid on an item.

1141
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:52,342
I was wondering if you
could take a look at this

1142
01:14:52,344 --> 01:14:55,017
and tell me if I'm in the right place.

1143
01:14:55,019 --> 01:14:56,737

Get on the floor! Get on the floor!

[screaming]

1149
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:14,249
Get me into that safe! Get
me into that safe, now!

1150
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:16,580
Open that safe, now! Now!

1151
01:15:16,582 --> 01:15:17,415
Move!

Just get me in the vault!

[Jack] You!

1159
01:16:00,004 --> 01:16:04,087
Put your hands on your
head before I blow it off!

1160
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:15,851
Jimmy, I don't got a
combination for the small one.

1161
01:16:15,853 --> 01:16:18,186
[Jimmy] I'm gonna blow it.

1162
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,544

1163
01:16:29,545 --> 01:16:30,572

[fuse crackles]

1165
01:16:31,574 --> 01:16:34,762
It's gonna blow! Move back, back!

1167

[explosion booms]

1168
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:50,548
The safe didn't blow!

1169
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:52,298
Hand-off! Get down there!

1170
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,268
Down! Get down!

1171
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:58,538

[indistinct yelling]

01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:30,242
Don't make another move!

[brooding music]

1177
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:28,885
[Jack] Dear Jacqueline.

1178
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:31,577
I've always known,

1179
01:18:32,861 --> 01:18:34,943
and I'll always love you.

1180
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:40,741
There's a package waiting
for you in Chicago.

1181
01:18:46,132 --> 01:18:51,132
[somber music]
[water swashes]

1182
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,100
You look beautiful.

1183
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:18,853
You know I love you.

1184
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,077
You may be angry with me now,

1185
01:19:24,055 --> 01:19:27,152
but Dante Calivari is what
a girl like you needs.

1186
01:19:29,455 --> 01:19:31,405
Your mother would be very proud of you.

1187
01:19:33,264 --> 01:19:35,772
But even she and I were very different.

1188
01:19:37,695 --> 01:19:39,077
So much pain.

1189
01:19:41,025 --> 01:19:42,483
After everything I've done for you,

1190
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:44,642
from the cradle to the grave!

1191
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:46,113
[Jacqueline] I'm not a slave!

1192
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:50,353
There's a price! There's a
price for the life you live.

1193
01:19:50,355 --> 01:19:52,098
How much are you willing to pay?

1194
01:19:55,695 --> 01:19:56,945
I'll leave you two alone.

1195
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:15,141
You will love me.

1196
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,755
[Jacqueline] I'll never love
you, Dante. Never love you.

1197
01:20:30,457 --> 01:20:31,846
You will love me!
[Jacqueline groans]

1198
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:34,293
[Jacqueline] You can take my
money! You can take my life!

1199
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:36,228
But you will never have my love!

1200
01:20:41,688 --> 01:20:43,605
[slap]

1201
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:46,073
[screams]

1202
01:20:46,075 --> 01:20:47,125
You will love me!

1203
01:21:01,325 --> 01:21:03,075
If your mother could see you now.

1204
01:21:04,715 --> 01:21:05,698
You look beautiful.

1205
01:21:09,303 --> 01:21:10,886
I need your help.

1206
01:21:12,275 --> 01:21:13,188
I already have.

1207
01:21:49,175 --> 01:21:50,393
[Jacqueline] Ace handed me my freedom

1208
01:21:50,395 --> 01:21:51,645
on the pier that morning.

1209
01:21:52,799 --> 01:21:55,083
He was the only one left that
could've helped me escape

1210
01:21:55,085 --> 01:21:59,378
this horrific marriage and
he did not let me down.

1211
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:01,883
Why do you think he decided to help you

1212
01:22:01,885 --> 01:22:03,275
in your time of need?

1213
01:22:04,165 --> 01:22:07,483
[Jacqueline] Well, for Ace,
this was more than business.

1214
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:10,768
More than diamonds or money.
More than wealth or power.

1215
01:22:11,825 --> 01:22:15,775
He had a score to settle
and a promise to fulfill.

1216
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:23,080
[peaceful string music]
[waves crash]

1217
01:22:36,615 --> 01:22:38,215
I'm glad you're here for this.

1218
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:40,545
Regardless of our past.

1219
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:49,990
[ominous music]

1220
01:23:06,933 --> 01:23:09,433

1222
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,711
What do you think you're doing?

1223
01:24:42,713 --> 01:24:47,162
[drowned out by gunfire] or
I'll spray you all with blood!

1224
01:24:47,164 --> 01:24:48,220
What do you think you're doing?

1225
01:24:48,222 --> 01:24:49,842
Making my move.

1226
01:24:49,844 --> 01:24:51,743
Drop the gun or we'll end you!

1227
01:24:51,745 --> 01:24:56,283
I know you won't hurt a
hair on her head! You can't!

1228
01:24:56,285 --> 01:24:59,170
20 years ago, you had sex with my wife,

1229
01:24:59,172 --> 01:25:03,672
and then got thrown in jail
and this how you repay me?

1230
01:25:08,315 --> 01:25:11,148
I raised her as if she was my own!

1231
01:25:12,572 --> 01:25:13,403
What?

1232
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,193
And how did that job go wrong, Jimmy?

1233
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:16,762
How did I end up in jail?

1234
01:25:16,764 --> 01:25:19,264
'Cause nobody fucks my wife!

[gun fires]

1256
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,873
[gun fires]

1257
01:26:43,678 --> 01:26:45,667
[gun fires]

1258
01:26:45,669 --> 01:26:47,287
[waves crash]

1259
01:26:47,289 --> 01:26:49,434
[gun fires]

1260
01:26:49,436 --> 01:26:50,755
[water splashes]

1261
01:26:50,757 --> 01:26:53,090
[gun fires]

1262
01:26:55,678 --> 01:26:58,207
[waves crash]

1263
01:26:58,209 --> 01:27:00,348
[Jacqueline squeals]

1264
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,183
There!

1265
01:27:02,929 --> 01:27:05,354
This is how you conduct
your business, Ace?

1266
01:27:05,356 --> 01:27:08,273
Drop the gun or your daughter dies.

1267
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:11,967
[gun fires]

1268
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:14,554
This is how I conduct my business!

1269
01:27:14,556 --> 01:27:16,889
[gun fires]

1270
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:19,755
- So!
- Dad!

1271
01:27:19,757 --> 01:27:21,257
This is endgame.

1272
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,784
Go ahead! Make your move!

1273
01:27:26,518 --> 01:27:29,196
Why did you do this to me now?

1274
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:30,781
If not now, when?

1275
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:35,887
Funny. My wife used to
say that all the time.

1276
01:27:35,889 --> 01:27:39,723
When did I get out of
jail, Jimmy? Tell her!

1277
01:27:40,852 --> 01:27:41,852
Six years.

1278
01:27:42,777 --> 01:27:44,027
Come June 20th.

1279
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:46,744
The day Mom died.

1280
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:50,010
Checkmate, old partner!

1281
01:27:50,012 --> 01:27:50,844
She knows!

1282
01:27:51,772 --> 01:27:55,439
Jacqueline, you are
just like your mother!

1283
01:27:56,798 --> 01:27:58,295
[Jacqueline yelps]

1284
01:27:58,297 --> 01:28:00,167
[gun fires]

1285
01:28:00,169 --> 01:28:01,407
[gun fires]

1286
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,282
[somber music]
[Jacqueline whines]

1287
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:06,786
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hurt you.

1288
01:28:06,788 --> 01:28:08,706
You never hurt me!

1289
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:12,523
I didn't wanna get close to anyone.

1290
01:28:12,525 --> 01:28:14,618
So I wouldn't be hurt by anybody.

1291
01:28:15,939 --> 01:28:18,967
But you were worth...

1292
01:28:18,969 --> 01:28:21,337
[coughs] It was all worth it.

1293
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:23,167
[Jacqueline sobs]

1294
01:28:23,169 --> 01:28:26,426
Help me! [screams]

1295
01:28:26,428 --> 01:28:27,716
Help!

1296
01:28:27,718 --> 01:28:29,097
Somebody help me!

1297
01:28:29,099 --> 01:28:30,349
Are you okay?

1298
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:35,323
Stay back! Get away from me!

1299
01:28:35,325 --> 01:28:37,632
Now you need me as much as I need you!

1300
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:41,570
But at least I love you! Can you?

1301
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:50,558
I do.

1302
01:28:51,806 --> 01:28:54,425
[gun fires]

1303
01:28:54,427 --> 01:28:56,927
[waves crash]

1304
01:29:02,073 --> 01:29:07,073
[somber music]
[waves crash]

1305
01:29:10,425 --> 01:29:11,298
So, you did it.

1306
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:15,014
You cut down your enemies and you escaped.

1307
01:29:15,895 --> 01:29:16,728
You survived.

1308
01:29:19,594 --> 01:29:22,438
But now? Now it's time
to resume your life.

1309
01:29:23,565 --> 01:29:27,762
And believe this. God
understands and forgives you.

1310
01:29:27,764 --> 01:29:28,718
This I do know.

1311
01:29:30,485 --> 01:29:33,303
But before you leave, there's
something I... [chuckles]

1312
01:29:33,305 --> 01:29:34,998
I'm sorry, but I must know this.

1313
01:29:36,315 --> 01:29:40,293
What happened to the diamonds?
[suspenseful music]

1314
01:29:40,295 --> 01:29:41,838
I'm just, I'm just curious.

1315
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,171
You still there?

1316
01:29:48,664 --> 01:29:50,944
[chuckles]

1317
01:29:50,946 --> 01:29:52,446
No, of course not.

1318
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:56,115
Yeah.

1319
01:29:56,117 --> 01:29:57,867
God bless you, child.

1320
01:30:01,498 --> 01:30:04,523
[horns honk]
[traffic hums]

1321
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:05,608
Checking in, miss?

1322
01:30:07,195 --> 01:30:08,932
The name is Black.

1323
01:30:08,934 --> 01:30:10,453
Jackie Black.

1324
01:30:10,455 --> 01:30:13,077
Oh, yes. You have a package
waiting for you in your suite.

1325
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:19,544
[brooding music]

1326
01:30:24,255 --> 01:30:25,605
She deserves her freedom.

1327
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:28,545
And they deserved their fate.

1328
01:30:30,395 --> 01:30:32,795
God takes vengeance on
those who perpetuate sin.

1329
01:30:34,849 --> 01:30:36,299
So you go in peace, my child.

1330
01:30:38,739 --> 01:30:40,575
And may you find your redemption.

1331
01:30:43,788 --> 01:30:45,538
Wherever that may be.
