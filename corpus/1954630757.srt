1
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,038
<i>I've been interested</i>

2
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,974
<i>in monsters my entire life,</i>
<i>since I was, er,</i>

3
00:00:41,976 --> 00:00:43,075
<i>old enough to watch TV.</i>

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,630
I was never really
scared by them.

5
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,349
I just liked them as characters.

6
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,317
<i>Like they were</i>
<i>my Mickey and Goofy.</i>

7
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,486
I'm really into monsters,

8
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,688
just as an escape, you know?

9
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,558
It gives you something
to put your fears on.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,061
I was in a mental hospital
for a few weeks

11
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,562
when I was about 14 or 15.

12
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,998
I was diagnosed
with depression and anxiety

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>and I didn't know why</i>
<i>I was sick.</i>

14
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,770
What really helped me escape
my reality was these things

15
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,739
that I was influenced by
as a kid which is watching

16
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,541
<i>horror movies</i>
<i>and drawing these monsters.</i>

17
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,009
I have been a monster,

18
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,710
I always will be a monster

19
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:21,413
and after I'm dead
I will be a dead monster.

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,282
Somehow I got to see
<i>Frankenstein</i>

21
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,951
which I looked at many,
many, many, many times,

22
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,719
and there was a certain humor

23
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,390
to<i> Frankenstein</i> and a certain,
er, niceness, er...

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,092
I always wanted
the monster to live.

25
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,627
I grew up an only child,
so they were my friends.

26
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,262
I lived
with my imaginary friends.

27
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,931
It's what, I think,

28
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,600
provided the background
for what I do in my acting now.

29
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,268
I think a lot of it was just

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,772
as visceral as
really ugly things,

31
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,874
<i>really frightening things,</i>

32
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,443
<i>holding my attention more than</i>
<i>beautiful, pretty things.</i>

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,812
We like the costumes,
we like the character designs,

34
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:57,983
we like the underdogs,
the misunderstood, antiheroes,

35
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,452
because they explore
different parts of humanity

36
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,087
that aren't often explored.

37
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,555
There're all kind of things

38
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,457
that, if we hadn't been
introduced to them,

39
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,126
we'd call them monsters.

40
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,627
There are monsters everywhere.

41
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,396
You know what the real monsters
are? It's frigging insects.

42
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,765
<i>They got claws.</i>
<i>They got antennas.</i>

43
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,967
<i>They got multiple eyes.</i>

44
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,903
They got pincers.
And they walk sideways at times.

45
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,507
That's a creature. People don't
walk sideways. That's stupid.

46
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,108
I feel kind of strange,

47
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,977
but I think that some monsters
could be real.

48
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,779
I think monsters exist
everywhere where we can't see.

49
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,616
I think, behind that chair,
just because I can't see it,

50
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,618
there is something there.

51
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,684
If they did exist,

52
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,687
they'd exist somewhere
where man doesn't live.

53
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,922
They couldn't be
out in the open,

54
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,045
people would shoot them.

55
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,926
You would find them
buried deep in the world.

56
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,763
Tromaville, which is
a very small town in New Jersey.

57
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:49,034
It doesn't matter because
if you're terrified of them,

58
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,235
they exist.

59
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,672
When we do find monsters,
if these things do come up

60
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,341
from the ground
or ascend upon us, like,

61
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,745
I just wanna be there to be,
"I told you so."

62
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,702
My name is Adam Green.

63
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,204
As a filmmaker

64
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:29,808
who has had some success
in the horror genre,

65
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,344
I... Can we just do this
with graphics?

66
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,712
No, just keep going.

67
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,248
I've made movies like<i> Frozen</i>,

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,985
<i>the</i> Hatchet<i> franchise,</i>
<i>er,</i> Spiral.

69
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,653
<i>I have a TV series</i>
<i>called</i> Holliston.

70
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:46,992
With that comes a very loyal
and cult fan base.

71
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,028
Stop! I feel like
a big enough<i> douche</i>

72
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,330
and you keep laughing at me.

73
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,366
You get to meet some
very unique people...

74
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,336
Like, er,
people will mail stuff.

75
00:03:57,338 --> 00:04:00,672
This Victor Crowley<i> maquette</i>
that somebody made.

76
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:03,508
This fan's underwear.

77
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,012
This bottle of pills
that somebody sent.

78
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:08,680
Really cool stuff like artwork

79
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,182
that people will make for us.

80
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,017
Um, which is awesome.

81
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,887
There was this one guy,
er, William Dekker.

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,359
I wish I had thought to be
shooting this the moment

83
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,894
this stuff first arrived,
er, but...

84
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:23,962
Say it!

85
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:28,267
OK, all right. William Dekker
claims, in all seriousness,

86
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,271
that he's found monsters.

87
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:36,041
<i>And he wants me</i>
<i>to tell his story to the world.</i>

88
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,449
Is that good enough?

89
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,886
I think we should
hire an actor to play you.

90
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,414
Dick!

91
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,073
I'm so excited,
she could explode.

92
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,808
I could explode. And I have!

93
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,949
I love<i> Holliston.</i>

94
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,518
I have a tattoo of<i> Holliston.</i>

95
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,619
Tell me what's on your arm.

96
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,255
I like<i> Frankenstein</i>.

97
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,357
<i>Spiral, Frozen.</i>

98
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,193
Yeah, I consider myself
to be an Adam Green fan.

99
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,332
I have a really cool
relationship with my fans,

100
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,968
and I think that that's because

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,804
like, when I was first
starting out,

102
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,406
y'know, when you're making
an independent movie,

103
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,643
you don't have marketing
or advertisements,

104
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,545
so you really gotta do it
yourself

105
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,946
and put yourself out there,

106
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,649
so people know about you
and know about your movie

107
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,718
and after a while though, like,

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,053
the more movies you make
and the more people

109
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,522
there are that want a piece
of you, it just kinda starts to,

110
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,825
I don't know,
I guess, takes its toll.

111
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,362
Now, the ones who do get through
are the ones who actually

112
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,397
take the time to write,

113
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,166
<i>like, a physical letter</i>
<i>to my fan mail address.</i>

114
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,328
<i>And that's huge, you know,</i>

115
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:10,973
<i>when someone's gonna</i>
<i>take the time</i>

116
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:13,038
<i>and write you</i>
<i>a long letter or send you,</i>

117
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,209
<i>I don't know, like drawings,</i>
<i>art, fan-fiction,</i>

118
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,379
sometimes really personal stuff,
I mean, it's awesome. So I...

119
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,669
Oh, sorry. Hold on.
It's the wife.

120
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,417
Hello.

121
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,485
<i>Hello.</i>

122
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,786
Hey, how are you?

123
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,821
<i>Oh, good! Where you at?</i>

124
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,923
Er, I'm with Will.

125
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,593
<i>Hi, Will.</i>
- Hi, Rileah.

126
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:37,062
<i>Do you know when</i>
<i>you're gonna be home?</i>

127
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:40,432
Er, ah, I dunno, five or six.

128
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:44,336
I think, um, we're gonna go
sit down with the guy now.

129
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:47,773
<i>Seriously?</i>
<i>Oh, you guys are idiots.</i>

130
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,508
You guys are idiots!

131
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,878
<i>Here we are at the</i>
<i>residence of Mr. William Dekker.</i>

132
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,114
I'm sorry,
Detective William Dekker,

133
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,450
the monster hunter guy.

134
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,520
I've already come here twice
before to sit down with him,

135
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,555
and the last time I asked him

136
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,798
if he would be cool
with us putting him on camera.

137
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,460
He didn't say no...

138
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,264
Now you people know they're not
to talk about this to anybody?

139
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,300
Oh, no. That's, like, standard
on everything we do. Everybody...

140
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,369
I didn't realize there were
going to be so many here.

141
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,538
Well, you want it
to look good, right?

142
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,907
I mean,
it's gotta be professional.

143
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:26,111
Which, actually, guys,
can you just... Here, my...

144
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,633
Here, my...
OK.

145
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,982
And is this eye good, or is...

146
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,984
No, you're fine.

147
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,386
I... you're sure? 'Cause I...

148
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,555
Yeah. Fine. You have enough.

149
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,889
About to roll!

150
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,025
<i>- All right, we're ready.</i>
<i>- Take one.</i>

151
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,361
<i>My name is William Dekker.</i>

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,465
I am a retired police detective.

153
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,168
I'm 61 years old and
I live in Southern California,

154
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,970
er, Chatsworth.

155
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,673
I have lived here
for the last four years.

156
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,242
Erm, now, I know
you've already told me this

157
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,511
but just for the sake
of the cameras,

158
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,247
basically,
what you're saying is that

159
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:06,151
you've discovered a world
underneath

160
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:11,356
our own world
where monsters live.

161
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:13,258
Every generation,

162
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,996
there are born children
who are different,

163
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,700
<i>And these 'different children'</i>

164
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,169
<i>are given cruel labels like</i>

165
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,106
<i>'monsters',</i>
<i>'freaks', 'rejects'.</i>

166
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,675
<i>And these children reach</i>

167
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,345
<i>a certain age</i>
<i>and they disappear</i>

168
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,846
<i>and nobody knows where they go.</i>

169
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,683
<i>And what's worse, they don't</i>
<i>even care that they vanish.</i>

170
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,919
<i>But I do.</i>

171
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,688
I do.

172
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,684
See, these children,
they don't die.

173
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,862
They're not even
far away from us.

174
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,898
They're right next to us.

175
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,401
<i>But they exist</i>
<i>in their own world.</i>

176
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,470
I call it

177
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,872
"The Marrow".

178
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,809
<i>Some 100 yards beneath</i>
<i>the surface of the Earth,</i>

179
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,946
<i>exists a metropolis</i>

180
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,984
that mirrors ours
in very many respects.

181
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,822
Life goes on down there,
there are marriages,

182
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,058
and births,
and divorces, and deaths,

183
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,895
and friendships,
and er... creativity.

184
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,332
They can be free.

185
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,269
OK, so why don't we,
kinda start at the beginning?

186
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,871
Let's talk about your childhood.

187
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,040
Tell me a little bit
about growing up.

188
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,009
Well, I was born, um,

189
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,247
into, I guess you could say,
a lower middle-class family

190
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,916
in Nashua, New Hampshire.

191
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,685
<i>I was a latchkey kid,</i>

192
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,187
<i>I didn't have any brothers</i>
<i>and sisters and I, uh,</i>

193
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,623
I didn't have any real friends
to speak of.

194
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,327
So I, er, had to occupy myself.

195
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,129
<i>There was a special spot</i>
<i>that I always went to.</i>

196
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,067
<i>And there was an old lumber</i>
<i>company, er, you know,</i>

197
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,303
<i>that sold board feet,</i>
<i>you know, lumber.</i>

198
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,373
<i>And it was all closed down</i>
<i>and locked up</i>

199
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,476
and the buildings there would
by my fortress,

200
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,111
be my castle, you know?

201
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,615
And I used to, er,
I used to defend my fortress

202
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,284
against the invading
barbarian hoards.

203
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,820
I had a hell of an imagination.

204
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,655
I bet!

205
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,257
You bet.

206
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,926
Yeah. Um...

207
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,029
It was rather late
in the evening, as I remember,

208
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,598
and I was late for supper,
I knew my mom was...

209
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,799
she was going to kill me,

210
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,134
so I came running out of
the main building

211
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,069
where I played primarily, and...

212
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,739
And as I came out
into the yard I...

213
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,744
I saw a man standing
by an old wood-pile.

214
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,547
As I drew closer to him...

215
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,323
Where am I?

216
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,662
I'm looking at his face,

217
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,791
and it doesn't look human.

218
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,270
No, he had a, he had a mouth
like a serpent's mouth.

219
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,606
It was sort of pointed

220
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,043
and it had real
thin lips and, er,

221
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,078
splayed over
the bottom lip was, uh,

222
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,449
I swear to God, a forked tongue.

223
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,819
And then when he blinked,

224
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:30,689
his eyelids
closed from the sides,

225
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,657
not horizontally up and down,

226
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,059
it was like...

227
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,595
I'd never seen anything
like that before in my life.

228
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,564
It terrified me.

229
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,965
Did he say anything to you?

230
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,636
No, he didn't say a word.
He just looked at me,

231
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:49,307
hard, and then he jumped
behind a wood-pile,

232
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,544
and I, and I ran around
the corner of the wood-pile.

233
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,945
He was gone.

234
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,781
Just, gone? He just vanished?

235
00:11:57,771 --> 00:11:59,851
- He's disappeared.
- Here one second, gone the next.

236
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,886
Gone, vanished..

237
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,022
So, did you ever
tell anybody about it?

238
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,524
- Like your mom or your dad...
- No...

239
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,166
And they wouldn't
have believed me anyway,

240
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,994
they would've thought I was
some kind of a nut, you know?

241
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,164
The overactive imagination
on wha... on their boy,

242
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,799
You know?

243
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,002
Probably would've thought I was
schizophrenic or something.

244
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,239
You know?

245
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,941
Yeah. Er...

246
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,909
And I felt that way
sometimes too.

247
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,613
Talking to my imaginary,
er, friends in the woods.

248
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,351
And I, er, never saw him again,
I did see others, though.

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,553
Oh, yeah...

250
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,756
Other, serpent, monster men?

251
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,924
Not serpent men,
I just saw other,

252
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,893
different ones, OK?

253
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,261
So, like a variety?

254
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,463
I-I never got
as close to any of them

255
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,532
as I did that first one, but,

256
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,936
if I hid in one of the buildings
'till it got dark,

257
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,372
and I looked into the woods,

258
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,877
I'd see their shapes,
moving through the woods.

259
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,580
<i>And there were big ones,</i>
<i>lumbering.</i>

260
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,049
<i>And there were little ones</i>
<i>that were darting in and out.</i>

261
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,486
<i>I saw their shapes. I saw them.</i>

262
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,055
<i>Well, anyway,</i>
<i>after about three months,</i>

263
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,825
er, I shot some footage there.

264
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,561
Oh, you got footage of,
of the monsters?

265
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,163
No, it was daytime.

266
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,899
I couldn't get
any footage of them.

267
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:21,941
So what did you get?

268
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,669
<i>Well, I found</i>

269
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,238
<i>what I believe to be</i>

270
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,308
<i>the entrance</i>

271
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,844
<i>to their hiding place.</i>

272
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,680
<i>The Marrow?</i>

273
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,349
The Marrow.

274
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,087
So, what do you think?
It's not a bad first day, right?

275
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,155
No, it was good.

276
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:45,657
It gets more comfortable...

277
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,625
Hey! Tell him not to touch that.

278
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,461
He's not... those aren't...
Those are our cords, it's fine.

279
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,430
What do you guys think?
Ten minutes to get outta here?

280
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,865
It took me 30 years
to get all this stuff together.

281
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:55,188
I don't want them
messing with it.

282
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:57,435
You do it in ten?
Ah, yeah, it's a lot of stuff...

283
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,704
A lot of stuff. What I really
wanted to ask though is, um..

284
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,173
Wait, wait, wait,
what's that behind you?

285
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,541
Oh, yeah,
what you got in there?

286
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,210
Er, it's a storage room.

287
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,846
Storage room?
Can we see what's inside?

288
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,768
- I rather you didn't...
- Oh, but...

289
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,282
- Dude!
- It's a mess!

290
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,984
OK, all right!

291
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,219
Hey!

292
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,455
What the fuck?

293
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,623
<i>Adam?</i>
- Yes?

294
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,305
<i>- Come here...</i>
- Coming.

295
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,367
All right, looking good!

296
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,468
Thank you.

297
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,738
Er, that corn's
a little burnt though...

298
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,306
No, the corn's fine.

299
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,863
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Rileah.

300
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,713
Why are you filming?

301
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,582
It's a documentary. Adam
told me I had to film dinner.

302
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,554
So, out of everybody
in the world, he picked me.

303
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,257
And you're not afraid that
this guy's some kind of psycho?

304
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,660
No! I mean, not...
Not really...

305
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,662
I wanna go on record
as saying that this might be

306
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,430
the worst idea that
you guys have ever come up with.

307
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,566
Er, I think both of us
would agree with that.

308
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,934
What if it was real?

309
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,769
I mean, haven't you
always wished

310
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,691
that something like this
was real?

311
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,709
No! No! Er, unicorns, angels,
I don't know,

312
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,444
hipster ghosts
like Beetlejuice...

313
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,780
- Beetlejuice!
- Yes...

314
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:16,781
- Really?
- Yeah...

315
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,383
You want Beetlejuice to be real!

316
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,120
Why would I want
scary monsters to be real?

317
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25,390
'Cause, this guy doesn't
think monsters are scary.

318
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,358
He thinks monsters
are misunderstood.

319
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,294
- Yes! Yes, and...
- Uh-huh?

320
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,857
- And...
- Yeah...

321
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,630
that's what this guy,
Dekker, is all about.

322
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,365
- Right.
- Seriously,

323
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,867
this guy is such a character.

324
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,269
When you see the stuff
we've already shot with him,

325
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,511
you're, you're gonna love him.

326
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,073
He's gonna be your new
best friend in the world.

327
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,141
Like you're gonna be friends

328
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,409
with him on Facebook. And...

329
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,476
No! No!

330
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:47,145
And, you're gonna
follow him on Twitter!

331
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,079
- No!
- He's gonna be

332
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,147
in your favorites!

333
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,782
No, definitely not.

334
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,150
You're gonna play Xbox with him.

335
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,585
What?

336
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,347
- I mean, basically...
- Ah...

337
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,457
This corn is awful.
You've burnt it, like...

338
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,992
- It's fine...

339
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:01,993
How do you even...

340
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,076
It's fine, just eat it!

341
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,762
The whole thing
could be awesome,

342
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,264
or it could all be bullshit.

343
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,899
- But either way...
- I would say it's not.

344
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,167
We're not gonna know
unless we do it.

345
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,234
You know, even if

346
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,304
the whole story is bullshit,
it's gonna be really funny.

347
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,807
How are you even... OK,
how are you even gonna finish

348
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,009
the next season of your TV show?

349
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,078
I'll figure it out.

350
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,079
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm...

351
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,981
This is just a side project.

352
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,917
And how does Krishna
feel about this?

353
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,686
Erm, ah, er...
She's OK with it.

354
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,754
Uh-huh.

355
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,423
She's better than OK with it
because she's a supportive wife!

356
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,659
Please don't get hurt.

357
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:37,128
I don't wanna have to call your
mom and have to tell her that,

358
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,432
"Adam got, er,
stabbed by some crazy fan

359
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,935
because he decided that he
was gonna go off into the woods

360
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,937
and hang out with him
all night long."

361
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,008
My mom would understand.

362
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,311
- OK. You rolling?
- Yep!

363
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,146
- OK, so...
- I'm rolling.

364
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,181
You know... You know what
I'd really like to do though?

365
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,350
Erm. I mean,
I'm ready to go so

366
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,185
I think it'd be nice
if I got a shot of the car

367
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,954
pulling up and
you guys getting out

368
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,455
and making it
look like a movie.

369
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,457
The car pu...
Why, why do we need the car...

370
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,693
'Cause it's cinematic, it's
gonna look nice, you know...

371
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,228
It's gonna look cinematic!

372
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,829
Come on! Come on!

373
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,798
Please, just get in the car
and go one more time...

374
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,233
Just one more time, please?

375
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,076
Christ!

376
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,083
All right, so, how far in
are we actually going here?

377
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,686
There's a cemetery
right up ahead.

378
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,754
Uh-huh.

379
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,930
We go about 100 yards
past that...

380
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,911
That's the entrance
to The Marrow.

381
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,462
So nobody minds
that you come out here?

382
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,565
It's a public place!

383
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,002
Right, but the sign
at the entrance

384
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,171
says that the park
closes at dusk.

385
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,441
- So?
- It's a public place!

386
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,013
Cause anything off that main
road is closed after sundown.

387
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,181
No I, I understand that,

388
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,016
but we're literally gonna take

389
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,752
some pictures at 'Magic Hour',
you know, like dusk,

390
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,787
and then we're gonna leave
right away, so...

391
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,590
OK, as long as you're
out of here before it gets dark.

392
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,691
Can I ask

393
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,095
why it's such a problem
if we're here once it's dark?

394
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,931
'Cause the park closes at dusk.

395
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,899
OK, but like, specifically,

396
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,000
is anything like...

397
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,070
Have you, like, personally,
ever seen anything...

398
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,973
The park closes at dusk!

399
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:31,943
Argh! OK, I get it now.
Thank you very much.

400
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,945
Has that guy given you
trouble before?

401
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,146
Yeah!

402
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,914
Several occasions
he's given me trouble.

403
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,816
Oh, watch out.
Watch your step.

404
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:39,951
OK.

405
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,625
It's right up there.

406
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,393
What is the...

407
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,995
The entrance to The Marrow.

408
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,632
While we're here, you
have to do as I say. All right?

409
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,168
You listen to me
and you do as I say.

410
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,604
I've never brought anyone else
up here before.

411
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:04,108
And it's crucial
that we just observe

412
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,810
and not try to interact.
Come on!

413
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,513
I just, er... I can't...

414
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,281
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

415
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:12,450
- I do understand, but I can't...
- You understand, Will?

416
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,152
Understood.
- All right, Come on...

417
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,923
You know...

418
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,059
The times
that I've been this close,

419
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,329
they've discovered
that I've found out about them

420
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,532
and they've moved on. I don't
want that to happen here.

421
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,601
So just stay with me
and you stay quiet.

422
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,504
What did I tell you to be?
Quiet! You got it, Will?

423
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,672
Got it. Yes, sir.

424
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,008
All right. Come on...

425
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,715
So now what?

426
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,918
Now...

427
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,287
We wait.

428
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,299
So how many nights are we...

429
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,967
Do you come out here and like,

430
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:07,171
hang out in creepy cemeteries
by yourself?

431
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,906
I try to come out every night.

432
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,543
Every night, that's a...
That's a lot of nights.

433
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,880
Yeah. Well I don't sleep
all that much so...

434
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,415
Why not?

435
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:22,186
I hear ya. I'm actually, I'm not
much of a sleeper myself.

436
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,655
When we're in production
on the TV show,

437
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:28,292
I'll go, I'll do 20 hour days,
22 hour days...

438
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,695
- Yeah...
- My wife can't stand it.

439
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,430
It's just...
I'm like a zombie.

440
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,600
Hmm. Well, wives are like that.

441
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,370
What's your love life like?

442
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,174
You've never mentioned, er, is
there a Mrs. Dekker out there?

443
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,642
Was there?

444
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,079
Er, nope. No Mrs. Dekker.

445
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:53,184
But there used to be.
A long time ago, but...

446
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,653
So what happened?

447
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,523
Just not work out?

448
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,926
Irreconcilable differences
or...

449
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,895
So what about you, Will?
What's your story, huh? Huh?

450
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,065
I'm married. I've been
married sixteen years.

451
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,166
Yeah?

452
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,336
Yeah.
And I have two kids. You know?

453
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,606
- You had kids?
- I have two boys. Yeah.

454
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,208
They're a lot of fun.

455
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,643
How old is Cole now?

456
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,811
Cole's 12.
- Twelve?

457
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,947
Sammy's going to be ten.

458
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,582
- Wow.
- Twelve and ten.

459
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,250
Yeah, they tear my house up.

460
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,820
I envy you.

461
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,723
They're a lot of fun.
I love them

462
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,791
Yeah.

463
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,998
Some nights,

464
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,603
I'll see several
of them coming to and

465
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,705
from that area right there.

466
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,008
Going back and forth
in the woods.

467
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,545
Other nights I'd see
just maybe one.

468
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,948
And a whole bunch of nights

469
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,750
where there's
no activity at all.

470
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,253
You just never know, never know
what you're going to get.

471
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,291
Listen, I mean,

472
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,253
if I don't get
any lights out here,

473
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,229
I'm not going to be able
to see anything.

474
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,098
You can't see anything?

475
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,834
Not really. I mean
I can see like three feet

476
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,235
in front of me but that's it.

477
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,705
What about using night vision?

478
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,641
Well...
We could use night vision,

479
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,476
But I think... I hate it.

480
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,346
I think it makes everything
just kinda look like green crap.

481
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,548
- OK, I'd rather it look like...

482
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,584
- What?
- Quiet! Turn off that light.

483
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,381
- Silence!
- What?

484
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,022
All right.

485
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,757
Right straight ahead. Look.

486
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,828
Where?

487
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,029
You see, Will?

488
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,365
No, I can't see shit.

489
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,833
Let your eyes
adjust for a second

490
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:49,900
then you'll see it.

491
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,837
It's right there.
Right in front of us.

492
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,171
What? There's nothing.

493
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:56,907
Look, look. Look, look.

494
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,145
One of them just moving very
slowly over to the right. See?

495
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,747
Will, turn on the camera light.

496
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,982
No, don't!
Don't you turn on that light!

497
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,652
Listen, if I don't turn
the light, I don't have a shot.

498
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,556
OK, he's gone.

499
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,827
Went back down.

500
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,098
He went back down, Will.

501
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,505
<i>Look, look!</i>

502
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,107
<i>One of them</i>
<i>just moving very slowly.</i>

503
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,509
<i>Over the to right, see?</i>

504
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,244
<i>Will, turn on the camera light.</i>

505
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:36,080
<i>No, don't!</i>
<i>Don't you turn on that light!</i>

506
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,083
<i>Listen, if I don't turn</i>
<i>the light, I don't have a shot.</i>

507
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,020
<i>OK, he's gone.</i>

508
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,525
Make a great radio show.

509
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:48,793
Did you raise the brightness?

510
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,294
- Oh, yeah, I raised it.
- All the way?

511
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,929
- All the way.
- This is as bright as it goes?

512
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,230
It's as bright as it goes.
There is nothing...

513
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,952
- Do it again.
- All right.

514
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,703
<i>One of them</i>
<i>just moving very slowly.</i>

515
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,971
<i>Over the right. See?</i>

516
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,740
<i>Will, turn on the camera light.</i>

517
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,109
<i>No, don't!</i>
<i>Don't you turn on that light.</i>

518
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:06,644
Awesome.

519
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:08,946
Good work!

520
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,019
I know, tell me about it.

521
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,790
Now this one here I call Vance.

522
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,426
Vance.
- Vance, yes.

523
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,595
You see with the sack
over his head,

524
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,230
his face painted on it.

525
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,798
Why Vance?

526
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,306
Because that's
what I want to call him.

527
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,406
Now Vance here, he never
ventured more than a few feet

528
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,208
outside the cemetery.

529
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,078
But the several occasions
that I observed him,

530
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,380
I saw him lead some

531
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,051
other rejects
down into The Marrow.

532
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,687
So my guess is old Vance is a...

533
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,424
Well, he is a kind of
a gatekeeper

534
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:57,361
or guardian, you know,
and he guides the new citizens

535
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,863
down into their new world,

536
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,532
and then he guards against any

537
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,767
interlopers, you know.

538
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,870
Did you...
Did you paint that?

539
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,471
- No.
- Because that's really good.

540
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:11,008
I had another artist
do it for me.

541
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,676
I commissioned it.

542
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,146
How close is that then
to what you saw, would you say?

543
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,348
It's pretty close, you know.

544
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,436
It's a pretty
good representation.

545
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,720
Umm... I would say probably
on a scale from one to ten,

546
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,955
about eight and a half, nine.

547
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,691
Yeah. So that's, this is Vance.

548
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,127
And why the bag?

549
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,562
Over the head,
do they all do that?

550
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:32,897
- Do they wear costumes?
- No, no...

551
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,365
Well some of them wear masks,

552
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,469
others, like Vance, wear a bag.

553
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:40,738
- Why is that?
- I suppose

554
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,239
Vance wears it because

555
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,042
what's underneath
that bag would be a little

556
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,412
too much to take, probably.
You know.

557
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:52,316
I... I've never seen
it under the bag but... er...

558
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,852
I'm sure it's a trip, you know.

559
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:59,023
And then others wear masks
to disguise,

560
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,191
perhaps, certain deformities.

561
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,328
So they could just be
all around us at any time then,

562
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,430
- is what you're saying.
- Well, not any time... No.

563
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:09,199
Er, there are certain times
of the year

564
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,669
that it's more conducive
for them to be around.

565
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:13,370
For instance, Halloween.

566
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,106
One of the few times
they do fit in.

567
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:21,545
Well, I'm hugely
into Halloween myself.

568
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,248
Spiritually,
that's the time of year when

569
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,584
the spiritual world is closest
to our world

570
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,118
and they're around us and...

571
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,720
I don't know...
I don't know anything

572
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,121
about the spiritual world.

573
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,389
But it's...
it's kind of like it.

574
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,924
No, it's not at all like it.

575
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,526
This is not a spiritual world.

576
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:36,860
These people are real.

577
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,395
They just happen
to be different.

578
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,530
- OK?
- Yup.

579
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,432
- Sorry.
- Now, this one...

580
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,768
This creature here

581
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,939
is a conjoined creature.
They're like Siamese twins.

582
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,040
They're joined.

583
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,742
Right up in here,

584
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,811
the upper spine and the torso.

585
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,713
And does this one have a name?

586
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,949
This one is called,
I call it, the Frog and Huck.

587
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,784
- Frog and Huck?

588
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,986
Frog and Huck, yeah.

589
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,089
And you painted...
The same guy painted this one?

590
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,624
No, no, my son...

591
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,125
I'm sorry?

592
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,427
Wait, wait... you never
mentioned a family before...

593
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,750
Err.. you notice a longer body...

594
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,797
No, no. This is really
important, though. I'm curious.

595
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,766
You can't see any eyes
anywhere on their body...

596
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:16,934
You've never mentioned a family.

597
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,235
You see it?

598
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,605
I totally see it but I would
love to know... about your son.

599
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:25,175
My guess is that they see
by a kind of audio sensory sight

600
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,746
rather like bats,
you know like bat sonar.

601
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:29,748
That kind of thing.

602
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,049
Wait! Wait, wait...
I'm sorry.

603
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,852
What is... You hear that?
Are you picking it up?

604
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,787
Stay concentrated and focused.
Will you, please?

605
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,255
I'm totally focused.

606
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:41,925
In fact, I really would love
to talk to you

607
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:44,962
a little bit more about
the whole use of lights,

608
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:46,163
non-use of lights...

609
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:48,132
That's not up for discussion,
all right?

610
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:51,835
No lights ever.
Lights scare them away.

611
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,772
Do you understand?
I explained that to you before.

612
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,540
Lights scare them away.
No lights!

613
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:58,609
I totally get it.

614
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,778
However, though,
I mean, all of these,

615
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,949
these theories, your stories,
photographs, pictures, drawings,

616
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,786
it doesn't...
It's not going to hold up.

617
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,921
Do you not,
do you not believe me?

618
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,990
That's not what I'm asking.

619
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,191
Do you believe?

620
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,293
Yes. How about this?

621
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:21,198
I really, really want
to believe. How about that?

622
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,869
Um, I mean... I want to
believe so wicked bad in this...

623
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,037
Yeah.

624
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,407
That's why I'm here
following you and doing...

625
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:34,178
I can tell you my wife thinks
I'm crazy for doing this.

626
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,612
Do you have any children?

627
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,915
Uh...

628
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,819
No, not yet. That's not...
It's... it's not really

629
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,387
the priority right now.

630
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:47,091
We've only been married
like three years or so.

631
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,726
That explains a lot.

632
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,997
OK. Um, how about this?

633
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,733
Eventually,

634
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,402
we're going to need to have some

635
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:02,639
monsters in our
monster documentary.

636
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,075
Right?

637
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,547
How's the night vision
working for you?

638
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,615
It's, er...

639
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,894
It's pretty good.
I mean I can...

640
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,954
I can see a lot further.

641
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,957
But, I mean it still
looks like an old green.

642
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:22,159
It's like a sex tape.

643
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,331
Kill it.

644
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,767
Hell...
Shh.

645
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,268
<i>What?</i>

646
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,604
You see those two trees?

647
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,106
What... What trees...
Those two trees

648
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,189
straight ahead from us.

649
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,642
We're in a forest.
There's nothing but...

650
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,364
The big tree on the right?

651
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,333
There's one right behind it.

652
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,818
He's not moving.
But it's there.

653
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:50,254
- What, uh...
- Don't. Stay still.

654
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,890
He might be watching us.
He may have seen us already.

655
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,759
Look, look, you see him moving?

656
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,361
- Huh?
- You see him?

657
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,031
- No.
- Yeah.

658
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,667
- Wait, I see something.
- Yeah.

659
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,036
It kind of looks
like a tree branch.

660
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,644
OK, dude, do you see anything?

661
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,214
Oh, God!

662
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,368
He's right here
in front of us now!

663
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,851
I... I don't see anything.

664
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,186
Turn, turn it on. The light.

665
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,687
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Will, turn it on!

666
00:30:23,695 --> 00:30:24,855
If it's here, I wanna see it.

667
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,990
- Turn off that light!
- Turn on the light!

668
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,693
Shut it off! Shut it off!

669
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,863
Right.

670
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,335
What the hell was that?

671
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:39,703
We're done.

672
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:41,672
What do you mean done?
We just saw something.

673
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,573
We're done!

674
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,541
We're done!

675
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,980
<i>All right. So, er,</i>
<i>camera's rolling,</i>

676
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,862
<i>tell me about</i>
<i>what we saw today.</i>

677
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:56,787
Well, basically, my boy,
Dekker, finally delivered

678
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,756
and we got a...

679
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:04,795
what I can only think
is a monster on camera.

680
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:07,564
And it's undeniable.
It was there.

681
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,167
We have the footage, and

682
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,036
I am... psyched,
because this is...

683
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,104
All right,

684
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,540
I will be totally honest,
for a brief moment

685
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,542
I was starting to think
the guy is completely crazy

686
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,710
and we've wasted our time,

687
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:22,179
which still could have been
funny for something,

688
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,649
but, but we saw it, and
it was real and it was awesome.

689
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:27,150
Don't you, er...

690
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,752
Don't you think
it's a little scary, though?

691
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,520
Why scary?

692
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,089
Why are you going
to be such a pussy?

693
00:31:32,318 --> 00:31:34,758
It's not scary. Just because
something doesn't look like us,

694
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,062
or look like everybody else,
doesn't mean it's scary.

695
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:43,433
In my whole life, I've only
wanted to see a real monster.

696
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,369
You know, when I was little,
I'd look under my bed,

697
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,504
I'd look in the closet,
not 'cause I was afraid

698
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,407
because I wanted it to be real,
you know.

699
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,745
I mean, it's just, you know,
think about Victor Crowley.

700
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,979
You know what?

701
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,180
Victor Crowley
actually kills people.

702
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,752
Victor Crowley is not real.

703
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,957
<i>Turn, turn, turn it on.</i>
<i>Turn the light.</i>

704
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,425
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>- Will, turn it on!</i>

705
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,526
<i>If it's here, I wanna see it.</i>

706
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,595
<i>- Turn off that light!</i>
<i>- Turn on the light!</i>

707
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:13,964
Stop it, stop it.

708
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,302
If that's a make-up job,
it's a damn good make-up job.

709
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,603
That's all I'm saying, right?

710
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,305
Well...

711
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,906
- Right?
- I'm just going off the footage.

712
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,608
Because I wasn't there.

713
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,643
But my gut is telling me that
you guys are messing with me.

714
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:28,412
We're not messing with you.

715
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,414
I tell your gut to shut up.
How about that?

716
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:32,149
You believe this.
You're a believer.

717
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,550
You believe in William Dekker.

718
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,952
Yes, well, OK...
how about this.

719
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,722
I don't necessarily believe him
but I believe this, yes.

720
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,324
I've always wanted
to believe this.

721
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,625
Haven't you always wanted...

722
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,795
Look at you... you have
a whole sleeve of horror stuff

723
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,330
and you're not more excited
by this?

724
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,498
Haven't you always
wanted this to be real?

725
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,368
I mean, I don't know about this,
like aliens maybe.

726
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,004
Aliens, aliens,
who cares about aliens?

727
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:57,074
This is monsters...
this is monsters. What if...

728
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,676
What if this guy's conspiracy
theories are all true,

729
00:32:59,678 --> 00:33:01,144
right, and he came to us
with this

730
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,412
and we're the ones
who are getting it.

731
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,747
Right, then maybe
we'll make some

732
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,315
of our money back
for filming this.

733
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,818
It's always money with you.
Why is it always about money?

734
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,819
I was just saying...

735
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,287
Whoa!

736
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,421
Oh, that's Kane.

737
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,689
Hey!
- Hey, boys.

738
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:13,824
- How are you?
- Hi, Kane.

739
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,325
- Good.
- Thank you for coming over.

740
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,526
What's with the camera?

741
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:17,928
- Err... we're just...
- It's part of a thing.

742
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,643
Yeah, we're just doing
a thing...

743
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,031
Thank you for coming so late.

744
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,332
- Sure.
- First, first you have

745
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,200
- to see this, OK?
- All right.

746
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,167
What are you showing me?

747
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,137
Wait, wait. We've been shooting
this documentary, OK?

748
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,272
- This guy contacted me.
- Documentary?

749
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,341
Yes, it's a documentary and...

750
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:32,376
Very fancy.

751
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,677
If you think that's fancy,

752
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,879
you should see all the make-up
he had on in the interviews.

753
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:38,648
I did... It's a formal
sit-down interview.

754
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,183
You have some make-up on.

755
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,818
OK, will you just
play this for us?

756
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,720
Just watch this, watch this,
watch this.

757
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:44,888
Play the tape.

758
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,590
<i>I... I don't see anything.</i>

759
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,765
<i>Turn, turn, turn it on.</i>
<i>Turn the light.</i>

760
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,060
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>- Will, turn it on!</i>

761
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:50,894
<i>If it's here, I wanna see it.</i>

762
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,196
<i>- Turn off that light!</i>
<i>- Turn on the light!</i>

763
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,732
<i>Shut it off...</i>

764
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,969
So what am I looking at?

765
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,871
What are you look at?
The monster,

766
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,872
did you not just see that?

767
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,240
No, I mean what's it for?

768
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,276
It's not for anything, it's...

769
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:08,979
Play it again, play it again.
Watch closely.

770
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:11,148
Look at this. Really look at it.
Go, go, go.

771
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,064
- Turn<i> off that light!</i>
<i>- Turn on the light!</i>

772
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,988
<i>Shut it off...</i>

773
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,558
It does look pretty cool,

774
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,160
but you can't really
see it that well.

775
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,861
- Well, it's the...
- Who made it?

776
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:27,197
Nobody made it.
That's the whole point.

777
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,266
- It's real.
- We actually shot this

778
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,068
in a cemetery up in Chatsworth.

779
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,503
- Yes.
- And it wasn't porn?

780
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,274
Chatsworth is the mecca of porn.

781
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,508
I know that, yes...

782
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,243
I'd like to see that part again.

783
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,779
There's no more than this.

784
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,416
I give... if anybody should
be excited by this, it's you.

785
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,285
If anyone knows monsters,
it's you.

786
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,188
Look at that, look at the neck.
The thin neck, the huge head,

787
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,290
how could you even do that
as an appliance on somebody?

788
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,692
- Want my real opinion?
- Yes.

789
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,935
- It looks really good.
- Thank you.

790
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,396
I mean, no, not thank you

791
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,231
because it's not...
We didn't do it.

792
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,201
It looks really good but it's...
you need to light it better,

793
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,369
- it's terrible, Will.
- Oh, come on!

794
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,972
It wasn't lit.
That's the whole point.

795
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:12,442
- Yes, it's exactly right.
- No, it's actual footage.

796
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,645
Actual footage. Found footage.

797
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,781
Boy, that hasn't been done
before.

798
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,250
- No, no, no, no.
- That's what I was trying...

799
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,651
Will you shut up?

800
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:27,224
No, it's not found footage.
It's footage footage.

801
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,459
- Damn!
- No, it's...

802
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,428
I'm so let down right now.

803
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,263
Well, what else you got
to look at, then?

804
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,399
We have tons, we have so much.

805
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,668
We've actually got nothing else.

806
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,541
<i>What you did...</i>

807
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,650
<i>could have destroyed</i>
<i>decades of work.</i>

808
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,816
Have you been back
to our spot since? OK, and...

809
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,520
Yes, I have and thank God
they haven't gone yet.

810
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,763
But they're moving around
with a lot more caution.

811
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:00,991
They probably chalked up
our little incident

812
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,927
to a random sighting and they
don't fear for their discovery

813
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,097
or that their entrance is
in jeopardy in any way.

814
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:11,101
OK, all right, but... Um,
I totally hear.

815
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,370
I want this to work so badly.

816
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:16,506
I really do.
But, by the same token,

817
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:20,277
you brought us into this
to shoot stuff.

818
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:24,214
OK? And if we can't shoot stuff,

819
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:28,018
then there's no story, right?
There's nothing.

820
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,620
So, help me here.

821
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,022
Yeah, yeah..

822
00:36:32,617 --> 00:36:34,858
Well, that's why I've brought
you over here today.

823
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,027
Is there any way
that we can shoot

824
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,663
and not be
so completely intrusive?

825
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,364
Yes, er...

826
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:45,035
Will and I have been talking
about that a lot.

827
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:51,575
Err... Will, why don't you tell
Mr. Dekker our plan?

828
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,310
- Good.
- Me?

829
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,978
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Do it.</i>

830
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,247
Um, OK. Well, er...
Here's what we talked about.

831
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:01,751
Um, so we set up
a fake street light,

832
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,153
if you will, out there.

833
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,156
A light that's just, maybe
could play for a street light.

834
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,557
We turn it on during the day.

835
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,161
We do all this during the day,
so no one is disturbed.

836
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,529
We set up
a street light out there,

837
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:13,997
turn it on and leave it on.

838
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,399
This is on.
- On all the time.

839
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,736
Then we take some small cameras

840
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,171
and we rig them to the trees.

841
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:22,839
We have a few cameras
in the office...

842
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,441
They're so small like
you wouldn't even...

843
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:26,176
- They're real tiny cameras.
- So small.

844
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:28,578
And we rig them to the trees
and just let them roll.

845
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,347
Let them roll.
Nobody goes out there,

846
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:31,848
starts and stops them. Nothing.

847
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,216
No lights on the cameras?

848
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,784
Nope, there's no lights
on the cameras.

849
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:37,053
How bright is that light
that you already have on?

850
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,188
- It's not...
- It's not...

851
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,223
It's not bright. It's soft.

852
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,627
Yeah, on a scale
of one to ten, it's really soft.

853
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:46,062
And nobody turns it on.
It's already on.

854
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,365
Nobody is going
to disturb anybody

855
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,899
With this,
with what we want to do.

856
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,835
- No.
- No.

857
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,056
- OK. So... We got...
- Shh!

858
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,760
- We got five cameras now.
- Yeah.

859
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,762
Pointing here for now,

860
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,964
they're pointed there,
at the cemetery,

861
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,732
and, if you look up there,

862
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,602
we'll hang that street light
looking thing.

863
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,671
It looks almost identical
to the ones

864
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,906
they have hanging
in the front of this place,

865
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:33,076
so completely unobtrusive,
but now we have light.

866
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,644
Now we can see things.

867
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,980
If that cemetery light
makes them suspicious?

868
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,317
It won't. Honestly,
I'd be more worried

869
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,086
making that Park Ranger
dude suspicious,

870
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,688
but hopefully,
he thinks that, you know,

871
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,024
like maintenance came out
and replaced it or something.

872
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:49,092
I don't know.

873
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:51,294
But I'm... honestly,
I am kind of surprised

874
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,029
that you haven't thought
of this before.

875
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,632
I have.
It didn't work.

876
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,270
Fantastic.

877
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:10,847
Actually, I think
it would be better

878
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,282
if we didn't have the music

879
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:14,617
while we're actually
recording the interview

880
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:18,121
because the music
makes it hard to edit with.

881
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,557
It's my favorite tune.

882
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,393
Who, who is this?

883
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,362
I don't know.

884
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,503
During my decades of research,
I've...

885
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:37,440
I have discovered
over 40 different species

886
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,143
going to and from The Marrow,

887
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,179
and that's just
from the half dozen or so

888
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,148
entrances that I have found.

889
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,983
- Half dozen or so...
Uh-huh.

890
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,820
Now are they always out
in the woods or

891
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,822
near a creepy cemetery?

892
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,991
Sometimes in the woods,
sometimes in the cemetery

893
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,960
and sometimes in other places.

894
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,664
The eye hop.

895
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:05,001
Eye hop?

896
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:12,242
Um, why would they have
a Marrow entrance

897
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,543
where there's an eye hop?

898
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,978
They like pancakes.

899
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,581
Pancakes?

900
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,518
Everybody loves pancakes.

901
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,191
Pancakes.

902
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,193
Of course.

903
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,403
Anyway, that one er,
entrance in Arizona

904
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:42,772
I couldn't really identify.

905
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,142
I mean I monitored the situation
for several months

906
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,778
but I couldn't pinpoint
where the entrance was.

907
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,716
However, the entrance here,
in Southern California,

908
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,553
is the most defined entrance
I've ever seen.

909
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,154
I don't want to lose it.

910
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,256
Because if you give them
enough reason down there

911
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,158
to suspect
that they've been discovered,

912
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,493
then they'll just move on.

913
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:04,894
I don't know
if they move underground

914
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,816
from one metropolis
to another but

915
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,666
you'll find the entrance sealed

916
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,468
like there was
nothing ever there.

917
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,703
And I would like to think that

918
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,506
the metropolises underneath

919
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,608
are connected in some way,
you know.

920
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,743
Like all the different areas
as...

921
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,980
'Cause I mean I'm looking
at that map and this...

922
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,315
It's all over the country.

923
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,586
And so you feel that they're
all connected underground?

924
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,020
I think that's quite possible.

925
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,256
Yes, but I don't have
any hard evidence,

926
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:36,092
of course,
to substantiate that, so...

927
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,930
Most of the subjects
are painfully shy.

928
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,300
Painfully shy.

929
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,636
In fact, one that I had observed
in Salem, Massachusetts,

930
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,605
that I called Brella...

931
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:49,672
Brella?

932
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,674
Brella, short for umbrella.

933
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,177
There she is, right there.

934
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:58,715
You notice here the umbrella
covers up her head entirely,

935
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,550
- as you can't see her face.
- Yup.

936
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:05,021
But she does have the body
of a normal human female,

937
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,024
and a very attractive one
I might say, you know.

938
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,279
In fact, I saw her
interacting with a human.

939
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,062
Interacting, how?

940
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,399
Like a human saw... saw that?

941
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,934
I saw Brella

942
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,537
in Salem, Massachusetts,

943
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,074
pick up a drunk college boy
outside of a bar.

944
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,243
- Wait... Do you mean?
- In an alley...

945
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,680
Pick up like 'flirted with',

946
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:34,484
like 'took him home', like...
What do you mean by picked up?

947
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:35,952
What does 'pick up' mean to you?

948
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:38,054
Well, that's... That's what
it means but I have...

949
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,222
Well, then, that's what I mean.

950
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,323
OK, but I would imagine...

951
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:43,560
She picked him up for some
sort of sexual escapade, OK?

952
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,662
OK, now if I got picked up...

953
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,030
They walked away,
they disappeared,

954
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,498
I tried to follow them...

955
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,533
Why wouldn't he say something
to somebody though if he...

956
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,936
Why... Why...
What is wrong with you?

957
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,572
Why can't I ever just tell you
something and you listen?

958
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:56,814
'Cause I wanna cut through it.

959
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,675
I mean, again,
it's another painting.

960
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,343
You don't have a picture,
you don't photograph.

961
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:01,611
Now you're telling me
somebody...

962
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,079
I'm telling you what she did.

963
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,215
She picked up this drunk college
boy. She went off with him.

964
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,377
I don't know what happened.

965
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,511
I tried to follow them,
I lost them.

966
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,987
That's it.

967
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,623
So then, then what?

968
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,857
What happened?

969
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,859
Then... after about three weeks,

970
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:19,963
a body washed up by a river
in Danvers...

971
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,865
Oh. The body of the boy?

972
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,601
Well...

973
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,868
Nobody really knew...

974
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,973
I mean, there wasn't much there
to be able to identify.

975
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,243
<i>All his entire jaw was gone</i>
<i>And no dentition...</i>

976
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:36,312
<i>The hands were gone,</i>
<i>the feet were gone.</i>

977
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,147
Just a lump of flesh...

978
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,316
Not very identifiable.

979
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,085
Now the case is still open,
you know,

980
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:43,820
it's unsolved but,

981
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,057
I bet my pants it was that boy.

982
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,628
In every society,

983
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,565
there are other deviants.

984
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,335
The bad seeds, you know.

985
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,473
The ones who are pure evil.

986
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,709
You're saying

987
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,145
that

988
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,681
something from The Marrow

989
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,917
killed somebody
and these things are dangerous.

990
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,186
Not all of them.

991
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,188
But some of them.

992
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,025
Perhaps.

993
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,698
Er... I think we're good.

994
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,600
For today. Can we stop?

995
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,841
- Yes.
<i>- Yeah, it's a cut.</i>

996
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,406
Forget the fact this guy
is just a complete psycho

997
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,007
which is a given.

998
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,110
But now he's showing us these
like images of these things

999
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,646
that may or may not exist,
right?

1000
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,882
And now he's says
they're killing people.

1001
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,051
I don't understand
what we're doing.

1002
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,987
Yeah, I mean you...
you were there. You saw it.

1003
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,822
You can't deny what we saw.

1004
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:55,558
Well, I mean I can't say
that I saw a real monster.

1005
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,126
Look at the movies we've done,
right.

1006
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,294
Like think about that.

1007
00:44:58,536 --> 00:45:00,496
All the make-up effects
that we put on the screen,

1008
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:01,597
the visual effects...

1009
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
After all the movies we've done,

1010
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:07,170
you mean to tell me that
you can't tell the difference

1011
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:10,973
between full latex or silicon
and what we actually saw

1012
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,041
right in front of us.

1013
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,712
I'm just saying it's possible,
you know. That's all.

1014
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,315
It's possible what?
That there's monsters?

1015
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,250
No! That this guy's
a total freakazoid!

1016
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,318
Guys...

1017
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,153
Listen... I mean...

1018
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:28,091
I'm not actually working
on this whole monster project,

1019
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,728
but what I am working on is
a little show called<i> Holliston.</i>

1020
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:36,232
Um, I am a little concerned,
Adam, do you have any scripts?

1021
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,402
They're almost ready... I uh...
they're gonna be done...

1022
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,104
But we start production
in like two months.

1023
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:42,572
And I will get it done.

1024
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,575
I don't want to just, you know,
I don't want to say

1025
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:48,010
"'Stop what you're doing
and write<i> Holliston"</i>

1026
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:50,913
but I really need you to stop
what you're doing

1027
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,381
and write<i> Holliston.</i>

1028
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,118
OK. If...
I swear to God,

1029
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,220
if you had been there
and you saw this,

1030
00:45:57,222 --> 00:45:59,055
you'd be just as fire up
as we are

1031
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:01,924
and you would be like, "OK,
the other stuff can wait."

1032
00:46:01,973 --> 00:46:03,893
And you don't think
it's dangerous.

1033
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,194
You don't think
you could get hurt.

1034
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,530
Listen, it was fun
when it started.

1035
00:46:07,532 --> 00:46:08,631
You know running
around the woods

1036
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:09,932
chasing the psycho guy around.

1037
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,634
It was fun. But now,

1038
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,103
Sarah's telling us
we're putting the show on hold,

1039
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,973
which means we're putting
our careers on hold,

1040
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:19,208
and, I mean,
I talked to Krishna about it.

1041
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,144
She's not really happy
about this whole thing.

1042
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,980
Oh, no.
You know, not to be a dick

1043
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:27,583
but I don't care
what your wife thinks.

1044
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:30,319
Why doesn't she write
the next season of the show?

1045
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,622
- It'll probably be better.
- Adam, stop. Stop it.

1046
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:37,059
All I am saying is that
an amazing opportunity

1047
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:39,128
just dropped right into our laps

1048
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,664
and now you're saying
you want to quit.

1049
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,966
No, no, no no. I'm not saying
that I want to quit.

1050
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,669
I'm just saying that we need
to control it better.

1051
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,504
We need to get done
what we need to get done.

1052
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:49,839
Not quit.

1053
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,909
Adam, like honestly,

1054
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,977
do you 100 percent
believe this guy

1055
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,379
and his whole monster thing?

1056
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,514
I...

1057
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,485
Ninety percent.
I 90 percent believe.

1058
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,224
Well, 90 percent.
That's a lot of percent.

1059
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,662
All right, that's number five...

1060
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,799
Uh, wait... I'm sorry.
Could you please wait?

1061
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,302
Because we need to shoot you
when you analyze the footage.

1062
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:21,637
So just wait till we get back,
please.

1063
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,440
So, you're sure that camera two
is in this tree?

1064
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,108
Yeah, I'm sure.

1065
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,179
And we have one, three,
four and five.

1066
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,181
<i>Definitely, two.</i>

1067
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,951
Uh, maybe it fell out?

1068
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,019
No.

1069
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,426
Uh, what about you, Mr. Dekker?
See anything over there?

1070
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,696
No, I don't see a thing.
Nothing.

1071
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,768
Well,
looks like we lost camera two.

1072
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,070
Come on.

1073
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,471
We got to get out of here.

1074
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,908
I will pay you back.

1075
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,713
<i>I got something.</i>

1076
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,694
- Huh?
- Adam, come here.

1077
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,017
Now look, look!

1078
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,086
Will... Come here, come here,
come here!

1079
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:13,189
- Oh, look.
- Dude, dude!

1080
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,826
Come here, come here, come here!
See... didn't I tell you?

1081
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:20,496
<i>That is awesome.</i>

1082
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,231
I've never seen one
like that before.

1083
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,733
- Really?
- No...

1084
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,501
<i>New species.</i>

1085
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,638
You want to name it?

1086
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,706
Me? No!

1087
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,909
You do it.
It's... That's your thing.

1088
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,543
All right, all right.

1089
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:36,505
I'm gonna call them
Little Big Foot.

1090
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,348
Little, Little Big Foot, really?

1091
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,310
He looks like a Big Foot,
doesn't he?

1092
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,921
Yeah, I mean if Big Foot
was a real thing

1093
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:47,523
and if anyone had seen it.

1094
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,726
What about, what about
something more original?

1095
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,295
You know what about, um,
Deringer.

1096
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,696
So you wanna name it?

1097
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:54,864
No...
You... You...

1098
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:56,198
All right, then.

1099
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,769
Little Big Foot.
New species.

1100
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:03,940
<i>You don't like Deringer?</i>

1101
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,544
<i>OK, stop it, stop it.</i>

1102
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,615
OK, so that was,
what, four hours.

1103
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,651
- Four hours
- Four hours, and then,

1104
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,853
whatever that thing is,

1105
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,656
crawls out of the hole
and walks away.

1106
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,627
So you honestly want
to try tell me that Dekker

1107
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:29,231
had some dude just wait
underground for four hours

1108
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,394
only to get up and walk away
for our cameras.

1109
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,971
You got me. You got me.

1110
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,072
Ha!

1111
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,643
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

1112
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:44,080
We've now cut our second monster

1113
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,182
on camera, and

1114
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,584
Mr. Dekker seems
to think that it's a

1115
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,821
new kind of species
which is all kind of...

1116
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,322
- Stay.
- What?

1117
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,757
Come to bed.

1118
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,325
I'm going to in a second.
I just...

1119
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,694
I have to do my recording
about the second monster

1120
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:00,656
or else it's going
to drive me nuts.

1121
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,934
Then I'll be talking about
monsters all night.

1122
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:06,369
You're cute.

1123
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:09,105
Seriously, though,
you need to sleep.

1124
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,606
I'm going to.

1125
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:16,278
In three, two, one...

1126
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,746
<i>So look at that...</i>

1127
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,549
I mean the teeth, the eye...
it's amazing, right?

1128
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,684
Yeah, very nice.
Who does your creature work?

1129
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,987
OK, that's the best part.

1130
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,025
Nobody. It's real. This
is real footage that we got.

1131
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,460
<i>There was this guy who...</i>

1132
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,195
<i>he wrote me a letter</i>
<i>through my fan mail</i>

1133
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:08,531
and he had this whole theory
that, like,

1134
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,233
you know when people
were born deformed or whatever,

1135
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:12,475
like where do they go?
You know,

1136
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:14,403
you don't just see
them walking around, I mean,

1137
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,525
unless you had a horror
convention like this.

1138
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,240
<i>But, it's, you know...</i>

1139
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,743
<i>he says that they've all</i>
<i>retreated underground</i>

1140
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:21,677
and that's where they live.

1141
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:25,047
So, we've been making this
documentary following him...

1142
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:26,315
Whoa... Hold it.

1143
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:29,051
You're reminding me
of the psycho of a guy,

1144
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:32,354
he has a name like Davis Darren?

1145
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,791
- Dekker?
- That's it.

1146
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:38,694
Er, Mick, Mick, would you come
over here for a second?

1147
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:40,296
Adam,

1148
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:43,399
Hey, Mick, how are you?
Good to see you.

1149
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,969
Adam is working with Dekker,
the monster hunter.

1150
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,204
Oh, no.

1151
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,106
No, I'm not. I wouldn't say
I'm working with him.

1152
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,440
You? He's harassing you, now?

1153
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,276
Well, no. We... I talked
to him once about something.

1154
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:57,746
"I found The Marrow."
That guy? Please.

1155
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:00,382
He's been after me,
and Tom, and Carpenter

1156
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:02,017
and Guillermo, Landis...

1157
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,787
Every horror director in the
business he's been bothering.

1158
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,923
He's antagonized everybody
for years.

1159
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,326
Trying to get us
to buy the movie rights

1160
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:11,894
to his stupid story.

1161
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:13,996
He's a real basket case.

1162
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:18,134
Err... Yeah. No.
Totally, I just...

1163
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:22,238
Grasshopper here
has been working with him,

1164
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,339
I can tell...

1165
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,940
No, no, I wouldn't say
"working with him".

1166
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,275
- What are you, stupid?
- No!

1167
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,911
I'm sorry, that was rude.

1168
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:31,614
- But are you?
- Uh, I guess sort of, I guess...

1169
00:52:31,616 --> 00:52:33,582
Anyway, your creature work
is great

1170
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,151
regardless of who's doing it.

1171
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:38,687
- How's your next movie coming?
- Uh, which one?

1172
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,924
I don't know. It's what you say.
I'm trying to be nice.

1173
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,260
Good luck, guy. Good luck.

1174
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,295
Have a good signing.
And whatever you're shooting,

1175
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,030
I'm not signing the release.

1176
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,365
Thank you.

1177
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,535
All right, so, er...

1178
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,036
Are we going to talk about it?

1179
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,674
He said, right up front,
that he's tried

1180
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,976
numerous ways to get
this story out there.

1181
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,378
OK? So...

1182
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,814
Yeah, it was embarrassing
that I didn't know

1183
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,449
that he had already been
to everybody else.

1184
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,852
OK, like what am I...
Is that what you want?

1185
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:11,687
Is that what you want me to say,
"I am embarrassed"?

1186
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,455
- that I feel stupid?
- No.

1187
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,992
But, look, when we get back,
the next time we talk to him,

1188
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:18,394
I'll ask him, point blank,

1189
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,462
who else have you
brought this story to?

1190
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,766
And, you know,
let's see what he says.

1191
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,534
Yeah, we'll see.

1192
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,003
You think he's going to be
truthful about that?

1193
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,148
So, one thing that
I've been meaning to ask you

1194
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:45,154
is why reach out to
a genre filmmaker with this?

1195
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:48,190
Why go to somebody like me
who does what I do?

1196
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:51,327
Well, heck, I tried the
authorities, I tried the press,

1197
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,329
I was even
on a couple of talk shows.

1198
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,930
Nobody wanted to hear it.

1199
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,468
They all treat me like
I was a nut, you know?

1200
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,137
So, I thought, you know,

1201
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,074
a filmmaker who had
a built-in audience...

1202
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,345
and who can capture
and tell the story...

1203
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,348
convincingly and properly...

1204
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,418
Properly. That would be
the way to go, you know?

1205
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,756
OK, then why not got
to somebody bigger,

1206
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,627
like an even more established,
you know, why... Why me?

1207
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,163
You work outside the machine.
I like that.

1208
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,803
So, you never reached out
to somebody else before me?

1209
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:37,072
Never went to anybody,
that is was straight to me?

1210
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:38,907
Nope. Just you.

1211
00:54:38,909 --> 00:54:40,042
Just me.

1212
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:42,311
<i>So, there were a couple of</i>

1213
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,647
<i>interesting things that happened</i>
<i>when you guys were gone.</i>

1214
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,569
I think
you're going to like this.

1215
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,770
<i>So, it'll start on</i>
<i>camera four here.</i>

1216
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,953
<i>We're looking right at The</i>
<i>Marrow and here comes Dekker,</i>

1217
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,188
<i>1:30 in the morning</i>
<i>with a bag and flashlight.</i>

1218
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,891
All right.

1219
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,560
This is where it
gets really weird.

1220
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,796
<i>He walks over to camera three...</i>

1221
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,299
<i>looks right at it...</i>

1222
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,635
<i>and turns it off.</i>

1223
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,706
Why would he shut...?

1224
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,509
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Goes over to camera one.</i>

1225
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,312
Again, right at it...

1226
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,480
<i>- And he shut...</i>
<i>- Turns it off.</i>

1227
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,459
All right, what I
want to know though is

1228
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,218
if he shuts off all the cameras,
like what is he not...

1229
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,088
Does he think we're not
gonna see that in the footage?

1230
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,724
He doesn't turn off camera four.

1231
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,860
<i>So he either doesn't know</i>
<i>how to work the cameras,</i>

1232
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,495
<i>he doesn't know how many</i>
<i>are up there...</i>

1233
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,763
<i>whatever.</i>

1234
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,532
<i>He's back at the hole</i>

1235
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:38,534
<i>signaling something,</i>
<i>it looks like...</i>

1236
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,704
and if we get in close,
he starts pulling something

1237
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,440
<i>out of the bag, and I</i>
<i>don't know what's in the bag.</i>

1238
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:45,774
<i>Maybe you guys can help me out.</i>

1239
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:47,009
<i>What is that?</i>

1240
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:49,378
<i>Just an old man talking</i>
<i>to a hole in the ground.</i>

1241
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,213
No, well, what's in his hand?

1242
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,116
- I know what that is...
- What?

1243
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,851
It's a... it's a spoon.

1244
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,554
<i>So, what is he doing?</i>
<i>He's taking dirt?</i>

1245
00:55:58,556 --> 00:56:00,516
<i>Was he taking samples</i>
<i>out of the...?</i>

1246
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,692
<i>I mean, he's like...</i>
<i>he's digging down there.</i>

1247
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,029
And then he puts it in his bag?

1248
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,299
No, no, no, he's taking
something out of...

1249
00:56:10,301 --> 00:56:12,634
<i>What's he feeding,</i>
<i>feeding one of them?</i>

1250
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,338
<i>I can't see... I can't see in.</i>

1251
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,706
<i>There's no definition.</i>

1252
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,875
<i>Such low light sensors that...</i>

1253
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,610
<i>He's feeding something...</i>

1254
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,113
<i>or he thinks</i>
<i>he's feeding something.</i>

1255
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,017
OK, then, what else?
What else?

1256
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:31,687
I mean, after that,
fast forward a little bit,

1257
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,690
he packs up his stuff,
stands up...

1258
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:35,824
Uh huh.

1259
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,093
<i>Walks back over...</i>

1260
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:39,528
<i>Turns the cameras on again.</i>

1261
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,497
<i>Yup, camera one comes on.</i>

1262
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,999
<i>Sets it up, clear as day...</i>

1263
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,868
<i>He has to know</i>
<i>we're going to see that.</i>

1264
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:48,103
<i>So, is this...</i>
<i>Here's a question,</i>

1265
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,006
<i>Is this on purpose?</i>
<i>Did he want us to see that?</i>

1266
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,108
<i>'Cause I'm...</i>

1267
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:58,213
I'm kind of... and then
he's waving and signaling again.

1268
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:00,482
<i>OK, awesome.</i>
<i>What else? Anything else?</i>

1269
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,853
This one is a little weird.
Um, the very next night,

1270
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,048
- Mm-hm.
- Four o'clock in the morning,

1271
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,025
<i>- camera one...</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1272
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,760
<i>I'll zoom in so you can see.</i>

1273
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,222
Here he is sitting
on the edge of The Marrow.

1274
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,035
<i>He's like...</i>

1275
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,150
<i>And I have no idea</i>
<i>what he's doing</i>

1276
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:24,785
<i>but he's sitting here for about</i>
<i>a minute and a half, 2 minutes.</i>

1277
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,777
He's touching something
in there.

1278
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,880
<i>What, is he petting one of them?</i>

1279
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,951
<i>I don't think is petting them.</i>

1280
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,321
What is it?
<i>Oh my God, wait...</i>

1281
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,391
<i>He's crying.</i>

1282
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,294
<i>He's crying.</i>

1283
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,300
I didn't know
what to make of it.

1284
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:52,501
He's like sobbing.

1285
00:57:54,444 --> 00:57:56,605
<i>I mean, the only other</i>
<i>thing I'm doing is catching up</i>

1286
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,641
on cemetery footage,
just hours of cemetery footage.

1287
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,249
This guy, it's like he's sick.

1288
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:11,386
You know, like, he chooses the
weirdest things to lie about.

1289
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,522
Isn't the lying just enough

1290
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:14,957
to stop this whole thing?

1291
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:16,158
No, it's not.

1292
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,193
Why do you have to keep saying
that we need to stop it?

1293
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,828
It's not enough. I don't care
about him lying to me.

1294
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,996
That's irrelevant.

1295
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,498
Did you tell Josh about
the other night?

1296
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,800
- What happened the other night?
- Nothing happened the other...

1297
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:25,868
It turns out that
this Dekker guy

1298
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,002
has gone to every single

1299
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:28,470
Hollywood director
with the story.

1300
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:29,938
Who else did he go to?

1301
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,374
It doesn't matter.
It... That's semantics.

1302
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:35,677
What matters isn't him,
OK, it's 'it'.

1303
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,679
It's where he can
take us because...

1304
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,781
And I know I sound crazy
to everybody

1305
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:42,017
but my whole life
since I was a little kid

1306
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,986
I had prayed for this
to happen to me.

1307
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,787
I have prayed for this
to be real,

1308
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:50,058
and now I have seen it...
and for better or for worse,

1309
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,629
this lunatic is the guy
who can bring me to it.

1310
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:55,531
And, OK,

1311
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,778
I know you guys
are going to say I'm trying

1312
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,903
I swear to God I'm not but this
is just the theory I have.

1313
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,472
I think that this is
some sort of psychosis,

1314
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:04,606
like this whole thing.

1315
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:08,043
I think that, like,
his kid died or something.

1316
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,311
And this is why...

1317
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,547
When we were in the cemetery
and you mentioned your kids,

1318
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,215
he was all over you
about your kids, right?

1319
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,483
That's right.

1320
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,652
And then when we were doing one
of our interviews with him

1321
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,655
he was showing me paintings
of the monsters.

1322
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:22,424
And I asked him about them,
"Oh, who painted that?"

1323
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,993
- And he said, uh...
- He said my son.

1324
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,595
Thank you. Yes.

1325
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:28,597
- And then, when I try...
- "Oh wait, son?"

1326
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:31,033
"Oh no", he
didn't want to go there anymore.

1327
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:33,602
Now he's feeding something
in a hole,

1328
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:35,270
something that's probably
not there.

1329
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,306
Maybe he's imagining it, or...

1330
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:39,408
This is where it gets
a little weird.

1331
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,777
Maybe he thinks
his kid is down there.

1332
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:42,778
His kid is one of them.

1333
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,845
Oh, boy.

1334
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,783
OK, I know... it's crazy. But if
we could just find one person,

1335
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:51,219
one person to vouch for him,
a family member, a neighbor,

1336
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:54,423
just somebody who actually
knows this guy in real life,

1337
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,858
not the life
that he's presenting to us,

1338
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,127
I'd feel so much better
because then I would know

1339
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:01,630
is he crazy? Is he mentally ill?

1340
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:05,701
Is it all a hoax?
And I'm just a sucker.

1341
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:07,169
You know,
but you like you Google him

1342
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,639
and he has no digital imprint
on the internet whatsoever.

1343
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:12,774
There's literally
nothing about... What?

1344
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,676
Boston.

1345
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,215
He was a police...
He was a police detective.

1346
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,617
So, what?

1347
01:00:21,672 --> 01:00:23,752
No, the original package
that he sent me,

1348
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:26,388
the original letter,
it says he was a former

1349
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:28,924
Boston police detective.
We can go talk to them.

1350
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:30,392
We're not going to Boston.

1351
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,094
We're going to Boston.

1352
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:33,261
Awesome.

1353
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:34,830
No, we're going to Boston.

1354
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,832
Awesome.

1355
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:45,307
Right now we're going to Boston
because I spoke to a guy

1356
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,150
at the Boston police department

1357
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:50,345
<i>but they wouldn't answer any</i>
<i>of my questions over the phone</i>

1358
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,681
<i>but the guy did say he would</i>
<i>give us, like, 15 minutes.</i>

1359
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:54,650
So, what I want to do is,
I want to sit down,

1360
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:59,021
I want to find out more about
when Dekker worked there,

1361
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:01,256
<i>like, maybe there's people there</i>
<i>who still know him,</i>

1362
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:04,459
and like especially
if he's talked about The Marrow

1363
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,528
and all this stuff before.

1364
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:09,598
<i>I think we're to get some</i>
really<i>... some cool stuff.</i>

1365
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,866
Great.

1366
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,168
- I don't know.
- It seems like a

1367
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,736
waste of time to me.

1368
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,339
OK, well, you know what?

1369
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,708
If nothing else,
we get to go home to Boston.

1370
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,476
When was the last time you
got to go to Boston?

1371
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,198
<i>What, like three years ago,</i>
<i>four years ago?</i>

1372
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,214
<i>No, I was in Boston two</i>
<i>weeks ago shooting a cable ad.</i>

1373
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,687
Well, you don't have to shoot
a cable ad while you're there

1374
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,121
so, um... it'll be fun.

1375
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,312
<i>I've been with the</i>
<i>Boston Police Department</i>

1376
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,081
now for 24 years
and I don't ever recall

1377
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,963
working
with this gentleman. No.

1378
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,964
What department
did he say he worked with?

1379
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,788
<i>Uh... he didn't specify that.</i>

1380
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,758
Well, I suggest
you have him contact us

1381
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:11,359
and as you can understand,

1382
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:13,528
I can't get
into the service records

1383
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,864
of a former police officer
with a third party.

1384
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:18,033
<i>No, I,</i>
<i>I understand that totally.</i>

1385
01:02:18,035 --> 01:02:20,902
<i>I just... I guess,</i>
<i>to clarify that,</i>

1386
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,106
<i>now, what you're saying is that,</i>
<i>to the best of your knowledge,</i>

1387
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,442
<i>a William Dekker</i>
<i>has never worked here</i>

1388
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:28,744
<i>at the Boston</i>
<i>Police Department?</i>

1389
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:30,779
That I know of? No.

1390
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,783
Just because the one guy
we talked to didn't know him

1391
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:36,351
doesn't mean that it's a lie.

1392
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:38,453
I mean you heard
what the officer said.

1393
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:39,755
Even if he did know something,

1394
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,042
he's not allowed
to tell us anyway... so...

1395
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,294
worked there. I mean... clearly
the guy never worked there.

1396
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,931
You don't know that.
That's according to one officer.

1397
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,767
When we get home,

1398
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:53,869
let's go back out there
to the spot

1399
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,804
but just me and you.

1400
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:59,107
No Dekker, so that way
if this is like a hoax,

1401
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,409
he's putting stuff on for us.

1402
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,612
He wouldn't even know
that we're there. Just us.

1403
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,213
Right. Just so we can freak out

1404
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:07,415
again and tell us how much
we are compromising his work

1405
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:08,817
and then quit.

1406
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,819
Not if he doesn't know.

1407
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:18,894
Is this it?

1408
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,395
Yeah...

1409
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,963
I know where we are.
Just park here.

1410
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,165
OK, cool.

1411
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,100
All right, let's do a quick
in and out, OK?

1412
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:26,423
I don't want to be
here all night.

1413
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:28,570
No, I just want to see
the spot without him here.

1414
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:29,571
That's all.

1415
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,239
Wait, wait.
How do you...

1416
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,908
Just twist the dial on the side

1417
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,442
Like that?
- Yup, that's it.

1418
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:35,677
OK, all right. Got it.

1419
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,980
All right.

1420
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,950
Let's wait, wait<i> .</i> Shh.

1421
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:43,218
What, what?

1422
01:03:46,577 --> 01:03:48,657
Do you hear that?
Was that your footsteps?

1423
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:49,758
No, I stopped.

1424
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,829
- Right, let's do it...
- Great.

1425
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,798
It's frigging hot tonight.

1426
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,999
Yeah.

1427
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,935
It's wicked, flack and...

1428
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You good, you good?

1429
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:04,005
Yeah, yeah, yeah trees.

1430
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,042
Well, I told you no more uh...

1431
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:08,677
no more ski-lifts at night,
right?

1432
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,799
So, this isn't that bad.
This is like home.

1433
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:13,181
It's the woods.
You know what's funny though?

1434
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,716
What?
- Is that during the day

1435
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:16,184
it's like,
'Oh, I am in the forest.'

1436
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,386
But then at night, it's like

1437
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,820
"I am in the forest"

1438
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,021
it's really scary.

1439
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,423
All right.

1440
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,527
And there it is...
OK, so... all right.

1441
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,862
Let me do my intro.

1442
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,499
<i>OK.</i>

1443
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:33,435
<i>All right, am I all sweaty?</i>

1444
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,871
<i>Um, a little shiny, not too bad</i>

1445
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,139
<i>- All right. OK.</i>
<i>- Hold on. OK?</i>

1446
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,142
- Into camera, right?
- Yup.

1447
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:43,712
Here we are at the entrance
to The Marrow, or at least

1448
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:46,748
what Dekker claims to
be the entrance to The Marrow.

1449
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,284
<i>No. OK, hold on...</i>

1450
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,820
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

1451
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,090
I thought that was you.
Do you smell that?

1452
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:57,693
You realize
we're in a cemetery, right?

1453
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:00,262
And uh... there's
dead bodies all around us.

1454
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,734
Um... I've stuck...
I've stuck my head in worse

1455
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:08,403
I actually went to Hopster
for four years so...

1456
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,105
All right, hold on.

1457
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,541
- OK.
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

1458
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,010
<i>You realize we're in a cemetery</i>

1459
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,845
<i>and you're sticking</i>
<i>your head in a hole?</i>

1460
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:18,967
I know that, I know that...
but I got to see.

1461
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,582
Hello?

1462
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,951
Monsters?

1463
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:25,587
Yani?

1464
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,258
Yeah. Dude.

1465
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,094
OK, here's one thing
I will say, though, is...

1466
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,536
I don't know if you can see it

1467
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,232
but when you go down it
curves around

1468
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,869
Oh my God. Dude.
It's got me! It's got me!

1469
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,939
Nothing? Really?

1470
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:45,373
No, Jackass.

1471
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:46,908
Come on.
Can we get out of here?

1472
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,710
You're no fun.

1473
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,013
All right, well, good.
I'm glad we did that.

1474
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:55,483
Now we know
we have lots of footage

1475
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,553
of a crazy guy who should
probably be committed,

1476
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,455
rambling around about nothing.

1477
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,497
We have a hole
in the ground over here.

1478
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,961
We have lots of old gravestones,
and we have a dude,

1479
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:08,229
who was probably
one of Dekker's friends

1480
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:10,999
who jumped out at us wearing
nothing but a Halloween mask

1481
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,667
which is... whoa...

1482
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:13,835
Dude...

1483
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,036
Sorry...
Oh!

1484
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,472
Seriously, seriously help me
out please, please, please!

1485
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,274
<i>I'm not joking, I'm not joking!</i>

1486
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,212
Someone took my boot.

1487
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,814
He grabbed me.

1488
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,862
Well, at least
you still have your foot.

1489
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,377
No, I'm serious, something,
something... It took my boot.

1490
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:32,787
You mean like a root
or something?

1491
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:35,957
No, something like
it didn't hurt...

1492
01:06:35,959 --> 01:06:38,893
but it took my boot off
of my foot.

1493
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,331
Bullshit.

1494
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,634
Fine. You know what? Here.

1495
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:47,769
<i>Hey, uh dude, can you do me</i>

1496
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:48,937
<i>a favor really quick</i>

1497
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:50,972
<i>and just reach in that hole</i>
<i>and um...</i>

1498
01:06:50,974 --> 01:06:52,107
- Aha, yeah.
<i>- And grab my boot for me,</i>

1499
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:53,308
<i>please?</i>

1500
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,676
You want me to get your boot?

1501
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,211
<i>Yeah, yeah... come on... do it.</i>

1502
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:57,645
<i>There's nothing in there.</i>

1503
01:06:57,647 --> 01:06:59,347
- All right, all right...
<i>- Do it.</i>

1504
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,386
It's pretty deep.

1505
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,354
It's a...

1506
01:07:07,563 --> 01:07:09,724
You know what?
No, it's your boot. You get it.

1507
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,860
<i>Oh, oh, OK, yeah.</i>

1508
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,129
Here you go.

1509
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,563
You know what? Um...

1510
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,533
I was going to throw
these boots out

1511
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,869
when I got home tonight anyway
because they're old

1512
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,204
and they smell.
So I don't even need it.

1513
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,106
And you're going to
walk home in your sock?

1514
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,328
I'm going to walk home
in my sock.

1515
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,245
But what about the snakes?

1516
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,313
There's no snakes.

1517
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:34,149
What about the spiders?

1518
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:35,550
<i>Oh! Spider!</i>
What, dude?

1519
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,085
Oh, you're such a dick.

1520
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:39,921
- Fine.
- Go get your boot.

1521
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:41,089
I'll get my boot.

1522
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,898
If something happens
to me, seriously...

1523
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,462
Damn it!

1524
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,364
And don't do that thing where

1525
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,732
something grabs you again.

1526
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,102
I would never do
the same gag twice.

1527
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,571
Have you seen Hatchet 2?

1528
01:07:58,441 --> 01:07:59,641
Go on.

1529
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,610
Just give me a second.

1530
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,347
Holy shit!

1531
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,116
OK.

1532
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,354
Go on...
- I'm going, I'm going.

1533
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,669
I can't reach it.
I can't reach it.

1534
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,745
Wait, wait, wait.
OK, hold on.

1535
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,478
Oh, shit!

1536
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:41,082
Whoa... Hah!... Got it!

1537
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:42,217
What the hell are you two doing?

1538
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:43,351
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1539
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,653
What have you done?
What have you done?

1540
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,322
<i>Nothing, we were just getting</i>

1541
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:49,824
<i>some shots</i>
<i>without you out here...</i>

1542
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,427
<i>potentially orchestrating</i>
<i>this shit.</i>

1543
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,995
What do you mean
by orchestrating?

1544
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,564
I can hear you half
a mile down the goddamn road.

1545
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,433
You have no right
to come up here.

1546
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:00,735
No... but there, there,
honestly something down there

1547
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:01,897
just totally took my boot.

1548
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:04,139
I told you we needed
to be discrete.

1549
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,474
I warned you.
We could scare them away.

1550
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,476
I warned you some of them
are danger...

1551
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,579
Public place.

1552
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,275
We have every right to be here
if we want to.

1553
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,618
- Both of you, that was stupid.
- It's not stupid.

1554
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:18,486
Don't film this now.

1555
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:19,954
No, I'm not recording.

1556
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:21,557
- You know what was stupid?
- You're not?

1557
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:24,259
No. Listen to me. What was
stupid? Was the other day

1558
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,827
when we took you out to coffee

1559
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,463
and I asked you point blank
have you said this shtick

1560
01:09:28,465 --> 01:09:29,998
to anybody else.

1561
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,099
And what did you say?

1562
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,035
I said that I took it to
a multitude of places

1563
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:35,503
before I brought it to you.

1564
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,640
No. No, no, no, no, no... I
asked you point blank. Didn't I?

1565
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:39,707
I asked him point blank,

1566
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:43,344
I said "Have you said this to
other directors in Hollywood?"

1567
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:46,181
And you said, "No, just you".

1568
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,616
"Just you". Just me,
that's what you said.

1569
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:50,718
And it's not adding up
at this point.

1570
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,387
It's never going to add up.

1571
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,023
If they move away
because of your meddling

1572
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,158
- Our meddling?
- Yes, your meddling.

1573
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,394
No, we're trying to tell
a story here because,

1574
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,863
you know what, like what if,
what if it was real?

1575
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:03,998
I want to believe in it.
He wants to believe in it.

1576
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,902
And I've sunk a lot of my time,
and a lot of his money

1577
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:10,338
into this so far, and honestly,

1578
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,640
it feels like Linus
waiting for the great pumpkin

1579
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,808
to arrive or something.

1580
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,143
- No...
- For all we know,

1581
01:10:15,145 --> 01:10:16,545
this is just
a bunch of your buddies

1582
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:19,013
running around in Halloween
costumes for our cameras.

1583
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,381
Well, maybe I don't need
the two of you

1584
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,983
involved in this anymore,
all right?

1585
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,519
But let's take this conversation
over to the road

1586
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:26,688
so we don't make the situation
any worse than it is.

1587
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:29,691
No. We're not taking
one more step until you admit

1588
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:30,959
that you've been lying.

1589
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,760
About?

1590
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:35,430
About... what haven't you lied
about? About everything.

1591
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:38,233
Monsters, The Marrow, your name.

1592
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:39,867
I don't even know
who you really are.

1593
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:42,270
My personal life is my business.
Do you understand?

1594
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,439
It's my business.

1595
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,941
We have been upfront with you
since day one.

1596
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:48,183
You know exactly who we are...

1597
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:52,247
<i>- Get down...</i>
<i>- What the hell was that?</i>

1598
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:53,348
<i>I don't know what it was</i>

1599
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,591
<i>but it brushed against my feet.</i>
<i>It went over there.</i>

1600
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,188
<i>They're watching us.</i>

1601
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:07,996
<i>What was that?</i>

1602
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,565
<i>Guys?</i>

1603
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:59,013
<i>Come back... come back...</i>

1604
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,185
Did you get it?

1605
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,647
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
It came right at me.

1606
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,323
<i>Will, Will... come on...</i>

1607
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,258
<i>- I'm coming, I'm coming</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

1608
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,192
<i>Give me one second.</i>

1609
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,114
<i>I want to see it,</i>
<i>I want to see it.</i>

1610
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,873
<i>Come on man,</i>
<i>let's go, we gotta go now.</i>

1611
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,975
They're coming, they're coming.

1612
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,210
<i>I'm coming...</i>

1613
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,846
- Come on, Adam.
<i>- Shut off those lights.</i>

1614
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,515
Shut it off.

1615
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:35,750
Come on, go...

1616
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,354
What is that? What?

1617
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,575
Drive around it,
drive around it.

1618
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,591
What the hell?

1619
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:53,301
<i>It's got him! It's got him!</i>

1620
01:12:53,303 --> 01:12:54,402
<i>-Let go! Let go!</i>

1621
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,166
<i>Drive, drive,</i>
<i>drive, drive drive!</i>

1622
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,178
<i>Has that ever happened before?</i>

1623
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:39,080
No, never to that extent.

1624
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,015
I mean, I've been followed once.

1625
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,350
I been chased a couple of times

1626
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:44,085
but an outright attack
like that...

1627
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,208
You see what you've done!

1628
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,255
What I've done? OK, hold
the phone here.

1629
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:49,724
First of all, you have not been
straight with us

1630
01:13:49,726 --> 01:13:51,058
since day one.

1631
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,293
OK, starting with the fact

1632
01:13:52,368 --> 01:13:54,529
that you never worked for
the Boston Police Department.

1633
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:55,430
What?

1634
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:56,731
- You never...
- Yes, I did!

1635
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:57,854
We went and met with them

1636
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,634
and they never even
heard of you.

1637
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:02,470
I was a private detective.
Private, you, imbecile.

1638
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:03,938
Don't' you understand English,
huh?

1639
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,339
Do you speak English?

1640
01:14:05,622 --> 01:14:07,942
I understand it enough
to know that you would at least

1641
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,777
have been affiliated
with their division

1642
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,880
in one way or another. But no,
they've never even heard of you.

1643
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:13,981
You know, I trusted you Adam.

1644
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:16,417
I brought you into one of the
greatest discoveries of all ti...

1645
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,119
- Don't point your finger at me.
- ...you go and screw me!

1646
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:19,620
- I'm not...
- Why are you screwing me?

1647
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,556
Because I don't know
if it's bullshit or not!

1648
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:22,824
Why couldn't you listen to me?

1649
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,559
Because I didn't want to spend
five more months

1650
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,494
running around,
looking at sketches,

1651
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:27,628
and looking at drawings,

1652
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,063
and listening
to your psycho babble.

1653
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:30,186
Well, listen to you, man.

1654
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,466
You sound like all those
other assholes.

1655
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,468
You're too blind to see
what's going on around you.

1656
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:37,138
Oh, I saw, I saw
something today.

1657
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,773
I don't know what it was.
Do you know what it was, Will?

1658
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:40,241
No.
- So, what was it?

1659
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:42,310
Back me up here.
For once, back me up!

1660
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:45,246
I'm going to go,
I'm going to go inside.

1661
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:46,569
Yeah, OK, you...
No, no, no, no...

1662
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:49,116
They know we found out
about them, Adam.

1663
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,885
They know we found them.

1664
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:52,320
They're going to move.

1665
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,182
They're going to close up
that entrance.

1666
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:56,657
And I'm going to lose him,
and I'm not going to lose him.

1667
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,192
Who? Who's "him"?

1668
01:14:58,221 --> 01:15:00,261
This is my last chance
and I'm not going to blow it.

1669
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:03,097
Who is "him"? Just tell me the
truth about one single thing.

1670
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:06,534
OK, how about this, Mr. Dekker?
If that's even your name.

1671
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:07,602
What about the fact

1672
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:09,637
that you went
to every director in Hollywood

1673
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:11,305
before you came
to us with this project, right?

1674
01:15:11,307 --> 01:15:13,474
What... well... I was like
the absolute last choice,

1675
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:14,575
and I asked you

1676
01:15:14,597 --> 01:15:16,878
point blank, when we had coffee,
and you lied to me

1677
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,879
- about that too!
- Bullshit, bullshit,

1678
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:18,946
bullshit, bullshit.

1679
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,649
OK, it's 1:30 in the morning.

1680
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:23,184
I think the best thing
to do right now,

1681
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,519
we were just attacked,

1682
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:25,987
let's call the police.
How about that?

1683
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:26,988
- No!
- Call...

1684
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,623
No police, no police.

1685
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:30,892
No police, if they've moved,
then I'll dig.

1686
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:33,160
I'll dig down. That tunnel's
still there, I'll dig.

1687
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:34,729
Then you can call
anybody you want.

1688
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,497
You call the whole goddamn
world, I don't care.

1689
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:37,798
Just get out of here.
Now go on.

1690
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,568
Do we even have lights
in the car if we go down there?

1691
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,638
I got to plan this.
I got to plan it.

1692
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,639
Well... I...

1693
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:45,973
Get out! Go on, get out!

1694
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,074
If you're going down there

1695
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,876
I'm going with you and
I'm seeing this through.

1696
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,244
We need lights
from the office...

1697
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:51,746
- Adam!
- We need two more cameras.

1698
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:53,668
Listen, listen to me
for a second.

1699
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:58,352
I'll meet with you here at
sunrise, you and Will.

1700
01:15:58,354 --> 01:15:59,420
All right?

1701
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:02,056
Sunrise. Then you can shoot
any goddamn thing you want.

1702
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,090
You can shoot
as much as you want,

1703
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:05,393
all right, I don't care.
Shoot whatever you want.

1704
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,194
OK. Sunrise here.

1705
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:09,330
We've two cameras
at the office...

1706
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:10,364
Now go, please.

1707
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:11,465
You're coming with me.

1708
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:13,100
I got to work.
I got to plan this<i> .</i>

1709
01:16:13,102 --> 01:16:14,201
Don't puss out on me on this.

1710
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:15,836
Get out... Get out!

1711
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:17,572
- I'm going to get out...
- Get out, Will!

1712
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:18,573
Where do we meet you exactly?

1713
01:16:18,575 --> 01:16:19,840
Here, here! At sunrise.

1714
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:20,741
Right here at sunrise.

1715
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,610
- Right here at sunrise.
- We will be back...

1716
01:16:22,612 --> 01:16:24,732
Get out of here, goddamn it!
I can't think!

1717
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,621
Maybe we should just go.

1718
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:35,663
I find it hard
to believe he overslept.

1719
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,593
Mr. Dekker.

1720
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,662
Oh, wait a minute...

1721
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,466
Hold on.

1722
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,606
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse
me. Hello. Hello. Sorry.

1723
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,309
I'm trying to reach the guy that
lives there, your neighbor.

1724
01:16:55,311 --> 01:16:56,777
<i>No one lives there.</i>

1725
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,580
No, no the guy, uh...
the old guy, William Dekker.

1726
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:00,815
The guy lives there.

1727
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,450
<i>No one lives there.</i>

1728
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,412
<i>That place has been</i>
<i>empty for a year.</i>

1729
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,221
OK, I am sorry, I'm sorry...

1730
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:11,993
- So...
- What?

1731
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,527
According to Dekker's neighbor,

1732
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:16,263
this place has been empty
for a year.

1733
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:17,598
Wait, so nobody lives here?

1734
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,533
No-one is supposed to live here.

1735
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,838
No, no, no...
- Oh, what do you know.

1736
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,139
No, no...
- Come on, come one.

1737
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:26,707
Mr. Dekker?

1738
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,077
Are you kidding me?

1739
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,516
What, he just skipped town?

1740
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,755
What?
- Look, look, look.

1741
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,524
Oh, man...

1742
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,092
You know what?
No, we should...

1743
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,661
We should just go.
We shouldn't do this.

1744
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:47,928
No, no, come here, come here.

1745
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:50,898
Man... Urgh.

1746
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,603
Urgh...

1747
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,177
Is that shit?

1748
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,547
- Urgh.
- What he...

1749
01:18:06,549 --> 01:18:07,882
It smells so bad.

1750
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,451
What the...
What did he have?

1751
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:15,489
Urgh... can we go?

1752
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,058
Yeah, did you get all this?

1753
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,060
- Did you see all this?
- Oh man, let's go.

1754
01:18:19,062 --> 01:18:21,696
Please, can we just go?
- OK, OK, OK.

1755
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,632
Dude, where we going?

1756
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:26,367
Where do you think?
We're going after him.

1757
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,335
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not going down that hole.

1758
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,603
We're not going in the hole.

1759
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:31,166
- Will you just come with me?
- No,

1760
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:35,414
We're not going back there!
Just get into the car. Trust me.

1761
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,681
Come on...

1762
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:42,650
Seriously, can we
please just call the police?

1763
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,119
Mr. Dekker?

1764
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,325
Oh... No, no, no, no, no...

1765
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,417
OK. Our final recording...

1766
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:18,419
in three, two...

1767
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:22,189
So, it's been
a little over a month

1768
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,924
since we last heard from...

1769
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,794
Dekker

1770
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:29,263
and I've tried calling,

1771
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:34,869
but like his number just rings
and about two weeks ago,

1772
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,637
it switched over to one of those

1773
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,640
"This number has been
disconnected" messages.

1774
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,210
But, last week...

1775
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:48,048
our missing camera,
camera two...

1776
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:52,486
was delivered to me...

1777
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,991
and, er...

1778
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,852
My name is...

1779
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:10,991
My name is William Dekker.

1780
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,061
If you're seeing this,

1781
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:19,500
I need you to understand
that I was wrong.

1782
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,907
There's no such thing
as "severo".

1783
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:28,642
There are no monsters.

1784
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,845
Don't follow me.

1785
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,949
Don't believe my work.

1786
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:36,951
Stay away!

1787
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,823
There's no such thing
as monsters.

1788
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:47,461
Monsters are not real.
Monsters are not real.

1789
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:51,365
Monsters are not real!
