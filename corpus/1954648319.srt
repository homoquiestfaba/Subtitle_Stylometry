1
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,667
So you've decided
to make your own luck.

2
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,236
<i>I can understand that.</i>

3
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,638
I made Heineken
into a world class brand.

4
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,241
Me. On my own.

5
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,943
It's worth billions now.

6
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,845
I did that.

7
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:48,714
<i>And not by sitting
on my ass either</i>

8
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,149
waiting for the stupid
money fairy

9
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,786
to hit me on my stupid
damned head.

10
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:57,222
<i>You know</i>
<i>that what you're doing</i>
<i>is completely stupid.</i>

11
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,058
Unless, of course,
you pull it off,

12
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,827
in which case it can be
completely brilliant.

13
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,763
Yeah. I suppose
if I were in your shoes,

14
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:05,964
I would do
exactly the same.

15
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,307
<i>Ah, there he is.</i>

16
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,212
<i>What are you doing?</i>
Huh?

17
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,114
What are
you doing?

18
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,949
You can't bring
a kid to this.

19
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,817
He can wait
outside with Brakes.

20
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,619
This is fucked up.

21
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,922
Listen, it's
not fucked.
It's fine.

22
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,657
Cat, can you put
the kid down, please?

23
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,559
Just give him
to my little brother.

24
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,595
Right. Now,
is everyone ready?
Yes.

25
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,037
- Is everyone ready?
- Yeah!

26
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,916
Alright, let's do this.

27
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,754
<i>Well, it's a pleasure</i>

28
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,889
<i>to finally meet you,
Mr. Iverson.</i>

29
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,891
My name is Cor Van Hout.

30
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:40,659
This is Mr. Holleeder,
Mr. Boellard, and Mr. Meijer.

31
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,094
<i>We're here today
in the hope</i>

32
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,862
<i>of asking you
for a loan.</i>

33
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,164
- A loan?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

34
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,266
It's a business loan.

35
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,201
<i>And what particular</i>
<i>sort of...?</i>
Construction.

36
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,869
<i>Yeah, we
were doing well.</i>

37
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,005
<i>Yeah, really well.</i>

38
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,641
You've been running
a company employing
a hundred men?

39
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,309
Yeah, well, we were
all equal partners,

40
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,111
yeah, right down
the middle there.

41
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:01,246
Um, Mr. Boellard here
is a master carpenter.

42
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,781
Mr. Meijer has a...

43
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,383
If these numbers
are real,

44
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,919
you're in
fine shape.

45
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,087
<i>Surely, if</i>
<i>you've been making</i>
<i>this kind of money,</i>

46
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,856
you must
have investments

47
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,958
that you could stake
as collateral?

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,993
<i>Uh, well, we had, uh,</i>

49
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,095
you know, cars,
and we had boats

50
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,031
and we had
some race horses but...

51
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,967
<i>Equities, bonds,
pension funds?</i>

52
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,903
When the recession hit,
we cashed in.

53
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,371
<i>The cars,</i>
<i>the boats,</i>
<i>the horses?</i>

54
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,307
It's for paychecks, uh,

55
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,809
for guys living
from one Friday
to the next.

56
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,644
I think
you can understand

57
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,781
that their kids
can't live or eat off IOUs.

58
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,317
I think, maybe,
what you haven't heard,

59
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,119
Mr. Big Manager,
is that, uh,

60
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,755
there's a world
of hurt out there
right now...

61
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:48,961
Oh, believe me,
I know.

62
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,763
Well, we still got
a building.

63
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,298
Great.
What's the address?

64
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,900
Uh, it's Leidsegracht.

65
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,235
<i>Six six three.</i>

66
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,403
Hold on.
Leidsegracht?

67
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,806
The commune?

68
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,874
Commune?
It's a bunch of punks
that don't pay their rent.

69
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,209
It's hardly
a fucking commune.

70
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,111
Yes.
Squatters.

71
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,180
<i>We're in the process
of evictions.</i>

72
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,781
<i>Government says</i>
<i>once they change</i>
<i>the locks,</i>

73
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,318
they've got rights.
So that means lawyers.

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,954
I do see your problem.

75
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,116
But you're
welcome back
when you solve it.

76
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,960
<i>Guys like him</i>

77
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,062
don't lend money
to guys like us.

78
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,397
<i>We'll get the punks
out of the building.</i>

79
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,399
Yeah.
How are you
going to do that?

80
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,134
<i>Yeah. I got
an idea.</i>

81
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,776
Alright, listen.
You're going
to love this.

82
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,044
It's time to go, boys!

83
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:40,245
Hey, what's going on?

84
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,047
Time to go!

85
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,483
Open up!

86
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,751
<i>Cat, get in through a window,
not the front door!</i>

87
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,153
<i>Open up!</i>

88
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,957
<i>Come on down!</i>

89
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,029
You don't scare me!
You fucking stink!

90
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,303
Whoa!

91
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,470
I'll come back
for you.

92
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,273
Get the fuck out!

93
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,209
Coming!

94
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,845
Fucking coming!

95
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,197
- Oh, shit!
- Get out of here!

96
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,274
Shit.

97
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,275
Oh, shit!
Oh!

98
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,115
<i>Get the fuck
out of here.</i>

99
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,527
Oh, shit.

100
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:02,561
You going
to go?

101
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,329
Go and get
the fuck out of here!

102
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:05,497
- Get the fuck out!
- Go on!

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,402
Now you're in trouble!

104
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,871
Go! Go!
Everyone out!

105
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,842
Go, go, go!

106
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,210
Hey, this is
our building!

107
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,145
We own this place!

108
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:23,115
<i>Fuckface!</i>

109
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:25,083
Police! Police!

110
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,284
Everybody go!

111
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,954
You want
to do this?

112
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,990
No.
No, I think
I'll pass.

113
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,025
Pussy.

114
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,262
Hey!
Whoaaa!

115
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,131
<i>Charge!</i>

116
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:51,009
<i>Get your fucking hands
off of me now.</i>

117
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,912
<i>I hope... well, fuck it.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.</i>

118
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,981
Fine. Thank you.
Bye.

119
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,150
What'd he say?

120
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,317
<i>Well, he said
if we lived in Texas,</i>

121
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,086
they'd throw us a parade.

122
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,587
But here,
well you know
how that is.

123
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,890
Yeah.
<i>Anyway, good news.</i>

124
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,525
Squatters aren't going
to press charges.

125
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,527
How kind
is that?
Whooptiedoo.

126
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,429
- Happy days.
<i>- Cornelius Van Hout.</i>

127
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,498
Yo.

128
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,167
Thank you.

129
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,638
- Only Van Hout.
- Huh?

130
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Hey.

131
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,408
Bad news. You guys
resisted arrest.

132
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,977
Plus, not only do they
get to stay in the building,

133
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,479
<i>we got to pay
for the shit we busted.</i>

134
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,215
Yeah, including
the fish!

135
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,083
Fuck the fish.

136
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,463
Sonja?

137
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,901
Hey.

138
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,403
Uh-oh.

139
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,038
No, no, no.
Listen. I can explain.

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,007
I... Sonja,
please, will... Son...!

141
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,244
Sonja, what
are you doing?

142
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,645
You alright?

143
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,451
What's going on, Son?

144
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,592
<i>What are you doing?</i>

145
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,360
What are you doing
hiding in my kitchen?

146
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,128
Hey, who are you?

147
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,697
Who are you, huh?

148
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,565
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know who you are.

149
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,501
I just worked it out.

150
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,970
<i>Yeah, that's right.
You know what?</i>

151
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,939
<i>You are way</i>
<i>too good-looking</i>
<i>to be Karin's boy. Hm?</i>

152
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,375
Oh, hey, Karin, hey.

153
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,377
Hey, how you doing?
I was just joking...

154
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,246
If you had any idea
what's been going
on with Sonja,

155
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:36,181
then you wouldn't do
as you do.

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,354
<i>What do you mean
"going on"?</i>

157
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,716
Sonja, please, wh...
what's going on?

158
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,427
I'm pregnant.

159
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,164
Ah. Ah.
What?

160
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,600
Ha.
Wow.

161
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,102
That's, uh...

162
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,238
Really?
That's unbelievable.

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
You're fucking pregnant?
Yeah.

164
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,643
I'll leave you two
to it then.
Bye!

165
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,078
See you, Karin!
Hey, come on, you!

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,447
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

167
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,584
Hey!
Hey, Ma!

168
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,519
Look at your hair
and your dress,

169
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,989
<i>you look</i>
<i>like a model.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

170
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,324
<i>Hey, be careful!</i>

171
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,526
Yeah, your sister's
knocked up.

172
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,361
Yeah, I know
It's great.

173
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,263
He doesn't greet
his old man...

174
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:26,498
or even have
a beer with him.

175
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,667
You know
I don't drink.

176
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,709
<i>Especially Heineken.</i>
Look at me
when you talk to me.

177
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,742
<i>Heineken beer
and Heineken money</i>

178
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,025
paid for this house
and for your upbringing.

179
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,586
You see that?

180
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,754
The man
is my friend.

181
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,624
But he fired you
and I don't think
he remembers your name.

182
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,373
You owe him respect.

183
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,076
- Okay, let's go.
- <i> Oh!</i>

184
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,577
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

185
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,614
Bye, honey.
Happy New Year.
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

186
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,717
Bye.
Take care of her.
Thank you.
Alright. Thank you.

187
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:21,119
Invite him round
next time, Pa.

188
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,554
We'll all
kiss his ring.

189
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,733
Well, that was festive.

190
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,635
Oh, come on.
Let's have some fun.

191
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,236
Let's go to Karin's.

192
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,704
Aw, come on, Sonja.

193
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,373
You know
what we got to do.

194
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,807
Hey? Come on.

195
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,609
I'll look
after him.
Come on.

196
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,845
Come on.
It's tradition, alright?

197
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,213
Yeah, go.
You don't mind?

198
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,848
No!
No?

199
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,150
Alright,
I love you.
Love you, too.

200
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,912
Go!
Have fun!

201
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,094
Here's to making
this year count.

202
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,364
Alright, to getting
our old lives back.

203
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,799
<i>Yeah, some fucking
New Year.</i>

204
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,502
We've no money,
the company's bankrupt,

205
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,704
and no one's going
to give us a loan.

206
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,306
So how are we going
to get our old lives
back? Huh?

207
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,275
We could get jobs.

208
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,510
<i>Yeah, that's the</i>
<i>alcohol talking.</i>
Ha.

209
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,545
I'm not getting
a real job.

210
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,314
No, I'm not going
to bust my ass
every single day

211
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,383
to go
absolutely nowhere.

212
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:31,289
<i>I think this year
I refuse to be miserable.</i>

213
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,458
Actually, that's, uh...

214
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,393
that's why I want
to talk to you guys
about some business.

215
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,262
Cor, we just got out of jail.

216
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,596
I'm not talking
about that kind
of business.

217
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,565
I'm talking about
smart business.

218
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,867
So what type
of business
you planning?

219
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,837
<i>I'm planning
something organized,</i>

220
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,573
something big.

221
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,909
How big?

222
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,511
Big enough that we
never have to grovel

223
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,313
to another
asshole banker again.

224
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,915
Yeah, right, man.

225
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,349
<i>We betting?</i>

226
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,784
Or we talking
about a crime?

227
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,621
That's all crime is.
It's a wager.

228
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,790
<i>Right?
Think about it.</i>

229
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,427
You bet your liberty
against the payoff.

230
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,498
All I have to bet,
all I have left...
is my liberty.

231
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
And that's all
you guys have.

232
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,702
<i>That's all you've
got left to bet.</i>

233
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:20,405
<i>So if you're going
to bet that,</i>

234
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,774
I guess you're going
to have to bet it big.

235
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,016
How big?

236
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,420
Sixty million.

237
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,452
Shit.
Sixty?

238
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,854
Who are you
going to kidnap?

239
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,489
<i>Kidnap?
Come on, man.</i>

240
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,758
Shit.
Man, I thought
you were serious.

241
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,292
Idiot.
You're an idiot.

242
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,428
He's serious.
I'm serious.

243
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,829
He's been talking
about this since we
were fucking kids!

244
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,799
Grabbing anybody
is easy.

245
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,869
Collecting the ransom
and getting away with it
is impossible.

246
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,905
<i>It's not.
It's not impossible.</i>

247
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:54,973
Who do you
want to kidnap?

248
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:59,544
Got to be a local.

249
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,713
It's got
to be a guy.

250
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,749
I'm not messing
with women
or children, eh.

251
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,318
He's got to be
stinking fucking rich.

252
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,424
You're out
of your fucking mind.

253
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,636
<i>It's like I said...</i>

254
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,971
<i>let's make</i>
<i>this year</i>
<i>count, huh?</i>

255
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,606
Woo!

256
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,975
Happy fucking
New Year!

257
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,888
Hi, there.

258
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,625
<i>Guys, look
what I've got. Huh?</i>

259
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,360
Cat, this is
specially for you.

260
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,429
Oh.
Wow.

261
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,431
What is this?

262
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,867
Who do I
look like?

263
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,269
What do you think?

264
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,270
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I love these</i>
<i>or hate these.</i>

265
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,738
They're scary, eh?

266
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,574
<i>I look like Willem.</i>

267
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,608
<i>No, you look
like a fucking pervert.</i>

268
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,977
Where's Willem anyway?

269
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,346
I'm not wearing a wig.

270
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,514
<i>We got to find</i>
<i>a place so we</i>
<i>can hide him</i>

271
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,616
where no one's
going to look.

272
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,718
My workshed
would be perfect

273
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,320
but there's an office
full of bean counters
next door.

274
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,488
Guys, we can't just
dump him in the shed.

275
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,726
No. But we could
build a room
inside the shed.

276
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,061
<i>That's good.</i>
It's perfect.

277
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,430
I found
a boat we can steal.

278
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:29,434
<i>It's fucking fast.</i>
<i>Was a boat</i>
<i>on the list?</i>

279
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,303
No.
<i>So why are we</i>
<i>talking about a boat?</i>

280
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,472
I'm trying to think
outside the box.
Come on.

281
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,708
Yeah, well, don't.

282
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,843
Whoa.

283
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,345
<i>Guns are on that list.
Right?</i>

284
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,447
Okay.
Yes.

285
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,916
<i>Now be careful
with that, please.</i>

286
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,418
World War II?
Safety's a little
edgy on that!

287
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,891
Fuck, Spikes!

288
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>Man...</i>

289
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,627
Shhh.
What?

290
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,861
Hear that?

291
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:57,962
Shit.

292
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,670
We're good?
We're good?
We're good?
Yeah.

293
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,538
Here I go.

294
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,707
What the fuck?

295
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,743
<i>- It's okay.</i>
- What was that?

296
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,546
<i>Yeah, it was just</i>
<i>fucking Rambo</i>
<i>over here.</i>

297
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:18,549
Listen, man.
Where have you been?

298
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:22,887
I've been thinking
about how we
grab Heiny.

299
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,023
<i>We've been trying</i>
<i>to come up with</i>
<i>some ideas, too.</i>

300
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,525
<i>What you got?</i>

301
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,060
<i>If we're</i>
<i>going to do this,</i>
<i>we have to make sure</i>

302
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,796
that the cops look
in the wrong direction.

303
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,066
<i>That they have to believe
that whoever took Heiny</i>

304
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,669
<i>he's, like, some
big swinging dick,</i>

305
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,840
like... Baader Meinhof?
Or Red Brigades?
Mafia?

306
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,677
And those fuckers
they don't mess
around. Yeah?

307
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,045
For a job like this,
they would have

308
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,614
military grade
weapons, radios.

309
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,083
They would have
a safehouse
to hold him.

310
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,687
<i>They would have months</i>
<i>of preparation, months</i>
<i>of observation.</i>

311
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,889
They would spend
at least a hundred grand.

312
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,124
Same old story, man?

313
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,493
Want to get rich?

314
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,929
You got to be
rich already.
Yeah.

315
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,166
If you want to do this
on a shoestring, fine.

316
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,835
But the cops are going
to look for a bunch
of local jerkoffs

317
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:15,006
and they're going
to nail us fucking flat.

318
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,074
Oh, fuck it.

319
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,979
<i>Let's pay another visit
to the bank.</i>

320
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,919
<i>shoot
at the ground.</i>

321
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,053
We know.

322
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,623
Okay, guys.
Let's go.

323
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,769
Now!

324
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,838
On the ground! Now!

325
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,179
Go, go, go!

326
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,447
Come on!

327
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,550
Go! Go!

328
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,824
Put your gun down!

329
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,036
Sorry!

330
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,537
Look out!

331
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,872
He's gone
to the next canal!

332
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,707
That's it!

333
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,516
<i>Cat! Get ready
to cut the rope!</i>

334
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,054
Go, go!
I'll cover you!

335
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,136
Come on!
Hurry up!

336
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,778
Come on!

337
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,947
Shoot at the ground!
Shoot at the ground!

338
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,289
Get down!

339
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,128
Shit!

340
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,611
Get out of the way!
Look out!

341
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,918
Hoo!
Woo-hoo!

342
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,686
You sure it's clear?
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,907
Yeah, Cor.

344
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,647
Wow.

345
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,917
Now who's big
swinging dicks?

346
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,839
Alright, it's time
to get down to business.

347
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,160
<i>How was your day?</i>

348
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,362
<i>Yeah, it was fine.
It was good.</i>

349
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:03,167
Somebody robbed
a bank.

350
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,836
Yeah, I know.
I heard that.

351
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:10,007
With machine guns,
like, Al Capone.

352
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,009
Wowww.
They shot
hundreds of bullets.

353
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,878
Hardly.
I don't think so.

354
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,713
It was all
over the radio.

355
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,748
And the TV.

356
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,419
Where have you been?

357
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,689
With Cat.
I was helping him
with his boat.

358
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,424
Where?
What do you
mean "where"?

359
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:31,762
At the, um, marina.
Up in Newlake.

360
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,399
Does he ever pay
you for stuff
like that?

361
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,761
Yeah. Yeah,
he does.

362
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,906
Mm.

363
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,908
Okay, okay.
Nice.

364
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,952
Amazing thing
about that robbery.

365
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,687
Mmm.

366
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,123
All that gunfire.

367
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,258
They didn't hit anyone.

368
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,830
Yeah?

369
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,232
Yeah, really.

370
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,400
Yeah, that's good.

371
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,468
Mm.

372
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,162
Thank you.

373
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,646
I've been waiting
for you, Obi-Wan.

374
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:54,979
That's good, right?

375
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,447
I'm going
to take that.

376
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,482
How much
do I owe you?

377
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,522
Hmm.
I'm going
to need a couple.

378
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,059
May I ask
you something?

379
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,927
You're not from
around here.

380
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,495
<i>No, I'm just, uh,
passing through.</i>

381
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:15,166
<i>Here's my private
telephone number.</i>

382
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,608
<i>I can show
you around.</i>

383
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,409
<i>I weighed it.</i>

384
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,978
<i>Thirty five million
is all we can carry.</i>

385
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,340
<i>Maybe the wood blocks</i>
<i>that were heavier</i>
<i>than the money.</i>

386
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,219
It'll all have to be
small denominations.

387
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,554
Yeah, and
different currencies.
I've carried
twice as much.

388
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,456
Oh, aren't you one?

389
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,091
I already picked
out my Ferrari.
A Ferrari?

390
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,126
Yeah!
You couldn't handle
a Ferrari.

391
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,362
You can
barely handle
a scooter.
Fuck you, man.

392
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,896
You want a Ferrari
because you got
a small dick.

393
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,231
Fuck you, man.

394
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,516
Ahhh!

395
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:12,390
<i>Ahhh!</i>

396
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,896
I didn't hear anything.

397
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,131
Yeah, well.

398
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,367
I'm surprised.

399
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,470
Well.
Yeah.

400
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,912
We have to test
these as well.

401
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,878
Cat?
Oh.

402
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,546
<i>Cat?!</i>

403
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,661
Where is everything?

404
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,496
What happened
to the cells?

405
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,398
What's going on?

406
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,133
What...?
What's going on?

407
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,636
<i>Where is everything?</i>

408
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,518
<i>I want you to think
of the Anne Frank house.</i>

409
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,376
<i>Oh, yeah.
Anne Frank!</i>

410
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,212
Fucking brilliant.

411
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,283
You're a genius.

412
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,486
Come again.
You're a fucking genius.

413
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,020
Where's the door?

414
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:53,991
Ask and you
shall receive.

415
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,274
We did do
a door, right?

416
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,966
Ah, good job.

417
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:04,468
"Respond to our
ransom demand

418
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,238
"by the deadline

419
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,407
<i>"by running
the code word 'Notice'</i>

420
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,510
<i>"in the newspaper</i>

421
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,412
or you'll never see
Heineken or Doderer
ever again."

422
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,150
<i>Okay.</i>

423
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,452
<i>Take it.</i>

424
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:44,675
Can you fucking
stop that?

425
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:50,514
Okay, it's time.

426
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,026
Shit.

427
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,128
No, it's nothing.

428
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,230
You don't
know that.
Look, it's nothing.

429
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,199
It's just
a coincidence.

430
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,802
There's always an excuse
if you're looking for it.

431
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:48,004
If we're
going to do this,
we do it now.

432
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,246
<i>Here we go.</i>

433
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,454
Alright, let's go.

434
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:04,622
Let's go.

435
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,465
Now remember,
if we need to speak,

436
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,067
then we only speak
in German.

437
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,287
Lovely evening.

438
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,589
We'll be in touch.

439
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,861
<i>Alright.</i>

440
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,201
Huh? Hands off.
What are you doing?

441
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,474
Who are you?

442
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:02,112
Let me go!
Let me go!

443
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,822
Dumb shit!
Get into the fucking van!

444
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,944
<i>What?</i>

445
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,724
Alright, alright, alright.

446
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,267
Ahhh!

447
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,539
Ahhh.

448
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:09,706
Okay.

449
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,477
<i>Ohhh!</i>

450
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,479
<i>Alright, okay, okay, okay.</i>

451
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:20,684
Alright, let me have
all their clothes.

452
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:22,926
Come on.
That's nice.
I'll get the barrel.

453
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,291
Hey, can we talk now?

454
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,026
I told you to speak
in German!

455
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,427
Your man
didn't fight
like mine.

456
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:32,829
Shhh.
Enough!

457
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,972
<i>Alright, listen.</i>

458
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:47,578
Did anybody
leave their fingerprints
on this ransom note?

459
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,880
Huh? I'll ask again.

460
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:55,586
Did anybody touch this
with their bare hands?

461
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:58,589
I may have.
Oh, fuck.

462
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:01,325
Alright. Is there
anybody next door?

463
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,526
They should have
left by now.

464
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,027
Come with me.
Come on.

465
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,864
Let's start.
Willem, where do I start?

466
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,052
Here.

467
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,526
The copier is there.

468
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,258
Let's go,
let's go.

469
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,983
It's okay.
We got a new one.

470
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,421
You got his watch?

471
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,366
Alright.
Now remember,

472
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,935
once you're done
with that,

473
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,469
you make out
like it's any
other night.

474
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,605
Mm-hm.
We'll be
at the bar.

475
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,440
I'll be there.
It's our alibi.

476
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,876
Hey, kid.
You good?

477
00:32:25,878 --> 00:32:27,644
Yeah?
You sure?

478
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:28,886
Alright, good.

479
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,586
<i>Just don't think
about it</i>

480
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:39,456
<i>being a police
station, alright?</i>

481
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,060
Ever think you'd deliver
an invoice for 35 million?

482
00:32:43,062 --> 00:32:45,095
Are they really
going to pay
all that?

483
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,337
They have to.

484
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,437
Can't we just mail it?

485
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,679
Come on.

486
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,076
Take a breath.

487
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:02,179
- Breathe.
- Go.

488
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,832
It's not exactly
my favorite
neighborhood either.

489
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,584
Package is
delivered, boys.
You good?

490
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:44,087
We're heading home.
Cat, Cat, Cat.
Stay for one minute.

491
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,223
Come on,
stay for one.

492
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:48,091
Yeah, one drink,
one drink.

493
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:51,862
You alright?

494
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:54,064
Do it.

495
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,799
Ring the bell!

496
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,134
Ring it!

497
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,823
You guys do it up
right last night?

498
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:21,591
Well, you know me.

499
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,893
We made sure
we were seen

500
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,061
and we kept
it respectable.

501
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,862
Good.
You?

502
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:27,798
Oh, it was riveting.

503
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,867
I fell asleep
watching cartoons
with the kids.

504
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,102
Yeah.

505
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,678
Well?
How are they?

506
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,081
Heineken's fine.
Pissed off.

507
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,718
The driver
is not too good.

508
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:21,585
<i>Now you
listen to me.</i>

509
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,588
<i>You are in
no danger here.</i>

510
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,824
Anhh.
As long
<i>as the money is paid,</i>
<i>you will be released.</i>

511
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,993
Anhh.
<i>Do you understand?</i>

512
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,301
Hey, guys.

513
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,769
Check it out.

514
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:22,078
Do you have
a name?

515
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,713
<i>No name.</i>

516
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,755
Is it ransom
or money?

517
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,155
Are you the boss?

518
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,357
<i>Okay, you're the boss.</i>

519
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,761
<i>So, I have
a few requests.</i>

520
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:41,998
I'd like
a bathrobe, slippers,

521
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,101
a shaving kit,
comb, mirror,

522
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:48,972
um, reading glasses,

523
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:52,809
a decent
fucking chair...

524
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,678
and, um, what else?

525
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,047
Oh, yes, and if it's
not too much trouble,

526
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,289
a telephone.

527
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,120
<i>You have
no name, huh?</i>

528
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:07,424
You're part
of an organization?

529
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,259
You're Baader Meinhof?

530
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,927
Red Brigade?

531
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,430
<i>IRA?
Symbionese Army?</i>

532
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,238
<i>- Hey, Cor.
- What?</i>

533
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,873
Look at this.
What?

534
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,442
Oh, fuck.

535
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,676
You're going
to love it.
Oh, nice.

536
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,345
Mm-hm.
Nice, nice.

537
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,013
Says five guys involved.
How many have you?

538
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,048
This one says three.

539
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,417
<i>Yeah, listen to this.</i>

540
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:39,122
"An unknown number
of most certainly dangerous
and experienced criminals."

541
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,223
Let me see,
let me see.

542
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,759
It's perfect.

543
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,728
<i>More about this
morning's top story...</i>

544
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,030
<i>Alfred Heineken,</i>
<i>the billionaire</i>
<i>of brewing,</i>

545
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,366
<i>was kidnapped by a group</i>
<i>of heavily armed</i>
<i>men yesterday...</i>

546
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,034
I know
who did it.

547
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:53,470
<i>...corporate in Amsterdam,</i>

548
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,138
<i>Police have</i>
<i>now confirmed</i>
<i>that they...</i>

549
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,041
Who?
Bud.

550
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,010
Weiser.
Bud Weiser.

551
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:01,978
<i>Yeah?</i>

552
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,247
<i>One way to beat
the competition, huh?</i>

553
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,751
Funny guy, huh?

554
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,887
<i>Police would not disclose</i>
<i>the size of the ransom</i>
<i>demanded</i>

555
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,922
<i>but it is assumed
to be significant.</i>

556
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,826
<i>What?</i>

557
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,395
The ransom note.
<i>What?</i>

558
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,096
The ransom note.
<i>What do you mean?</i>

559
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,465
Did we leave it?
In the copier?
No, no.

560
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,001
<i>...chased, until</i>
<i>he was threatened</i>
<i>by the kidnappers</i>

561
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,269
<i>with a machine gun.</i>

562
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,804
Wait, did we...?

563
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,872
<i>No, did we?</i>

564
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,910
Oh, fuck.

565
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:55,532
<i>Hey, uh...</i>

566
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,334
George.
George, yeah.

567
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,035
Remember me?
Yeah.

568
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,171
How's it going?
Same old, same old.

569
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,773
So everything's alright?
I guess.

570
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,275
Do you mind
if we make
a quick copy?

571
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,444
Go ahead.
Thank you.

572
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,545
Thank you.

573
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,512
Thank you.

574
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,988
Thank you
for that, too.

575
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,092
I assume you, uh,
sent a note about
the ransom.

576
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,194
<i>Did they reply?</i>

577
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:00,430
<i>Well, they will.</i>

578
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,537
In the meantime,

579
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,607
this music,
it's beautiful and laden
with tragic disillusion

580
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:14,577
but, uh, the same tape
over and over again,
all day long,

581
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,880
please, I know
I am your prisoner

582
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,349
but there's no need
to torture me,
my friend.

583
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:24,354
Some Johann Sebastian Bach
would be quite soothing.
Or, well...

584
00:40:24,356 --> 00:40:28,858
Franz Fucking
Schubert, anything.
Silence, preferably.

585
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,394
Also, some books
would pass the time

586
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:35,198
and as much as I
adore ham sandwiches,
my friend,

587
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,369
Chinese food is
quite easy to get,
and it's cheap too,

588
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,572
and, uh, I know,
something like, um,

589
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,641
yeah, Bang Bang chicken.

590
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:48,111
With some
extra chili sauce,
how about that? Okay?

591
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,388
<i>- Happy birthday.
- Cheers.</i>

592
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:01,157
<i>You'll be looking for
a regular paycheck now, hey.</i>

593
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,926
<i>Ah, finally.</i>

594
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,194
<i>I can serve
the cake now.</i>

595
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:06,129
Hi, honey.

596
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,032
No more
fooling around, huh?

597
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:11,468
<i>- My son Mark, he drives a tram.
- </i> Yeah, I know Mark.

598
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,536
<i>Yeah, he's got
good hours.</i>

599
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:16,673
Most importantly,
he's got a good pension.
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

600
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,908
<i>You'd have to take
the training first.</i>

601
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,110
<i>Really? They train?</i>

602
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,393
<i>I could have</i>
<i>a word with him...</i>
Yeah, could you?

603
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,649
Always the same stupid joke.

604
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:30,386
<i>From my daughter
as well, now?</i>

605
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,322
Wonderful.

606
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,389
What a kind and
thoughtful gift,
thank you.

607
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,091
Pa, it was a joke.

608
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,597
Cannot you at least
wait till they let
Mr. Heineken go, huh?

609
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,298
<i>If they ever do
let him go.</i>

610
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,167
<i>Don't start
on this again.</i>

611
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,502
If I get
those filthy bastards,
I will kill them.

612
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:47,937
We know.
We know.
Kill them!

613
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,006
<i>Willem, please,</i>
<i>it's Pa's birthday.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

614
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,983
<i>Cat?</i>

615
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:04,020
<i>How long do you reckon it'll</i>
<i>take Heineken's people</i>
<i>to pay the ransom?</i>

616
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,488
Cat. How long
do you reckon it'll...?

617
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,224
No more questions.

618
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:11,746
Because I
don't have
the answers.

619
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,003
<i>Aw, thanks.</i>

620
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,538
Hey, and thanks
for the new music.

621
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,974
It's very whimsical,
very droll. Yeah.

622
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,409
Got books!
Good.

623
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,978
Alright.

624
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,514
Any luck
with the Bang Bang?

625
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:33,283
<i>Huh?</i>

626
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:34,350
No?

627
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,027
<i>Some guys like
Bang Bang chili all the time.</i>

628
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,662
But you like
sweet sour.

629
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,497
Ever since five years.

630
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:50,266
Sweet sour pork,
sweet sour prawn,

631
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,235
sweet sour beef.
You're a sweet sour guy.

632
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,203
<i>So it's
Chinese, right?</i>

633
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,339
Now me
is a chili guy.
Okay, okay.

634
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,675
You a goddamn
Bang Bang man.

635
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,414
Right.
See you tomorrow.

636
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,115
<i>What can I
get for you?</i>

637
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,318
Ah!

638
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,752
<i>Wake up.</i>

639
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,023
Fuck you, man.

640
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,492
Did they run
the notice?
Not yet.

641
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,596
Come on, man,
this was only supposed
to take five days.

642
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,531
What if he is sick?

643
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:23,299
We gotta kidnap
a fucking doctor?
Is he sick?

644
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,535
No.

645
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,136
Don't get
too personal.

646
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,419
Or he'll get
inside your head.

647
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,486
Look, leather jacket,
Popeye.

648
00:43:43,488 --> 00:43:44,754
Cops?

649
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,672
<i>Willem, even if
they are cops,</i>

650
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:04,707
<i>it doesn't mean anything.</i>

651
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:06,275
You okay?

652
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,344
Fuck, I'm just
done waiting.

653
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,712
Yeah, I know.

654
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:10,780
I know.
Alright?
Me, too.

655
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,228
What are you
trying to do?

656
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,263
Huh?

657
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:29,465
Uh-huh.

658
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,267
Yeah.

659
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:32,869
Mm-hm.

660
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,671
If you tell
the Police where I am,

661
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,572
I could give you
half the ransom
and, uh,

662
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,207
a house
in Switzerland.

663
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,176
Lots of beautiful
Swiss girls,

664
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,412
blond, they're beautiful.

665
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:45,515
I'll...

666
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:49,218
I'll arrange it
as many as you like.

667
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,521
No?
You're not interested?

668
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,223
Are you gay
or something? Huh?

669
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:58,661
Any news
from the Police?

670
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:01,497
Oh.

671
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,840
<i>It's been over
two weeks now.</i>

672
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,809
<i>The longer
they don't pay the money,</i>

673
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,211
<i>the more time they have
to figure out who did it.</i>

674
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,414
You want to give up?

675
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,583
<i>I do.</i>

676
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:22,585
<i>You what?</i>

677
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,254
I do, yeah.

678
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,757
<i>Let's let him go.</i>

679
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,759
Knock down the cells,

680
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,495
burn everything.

681
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:36,165
<i>Okay, we don't get
the money,</i>

682
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,267
but you know
what we do get?

683
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,603
Our lives back.
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

684
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,805
Come on, look,
they're just
messing with us.

685
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:45,775
<i>That's all that is.</i>

686
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:46,809
<i>Cat, where you going?</i>

687
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,544
Uh... Really?
Cat...

688
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,813
<i>Wait!</i>
We failed!

689
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,815
It's my fucking shed.
I want him out of there.

690
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:54,617
Before it's too late.

691
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:56,486
<i>Look, just listen!
Just listen.</i>

692
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,187
Listen, listen, alright?

693
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,256
Look, it's all
just part of the game.

694
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,525
<i>We're still
in control here.</i>

695
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:04,327
<i>You really want
to walk out...</i>

696
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:08,564
on 35 million?
Huh?

697
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:12,568
What we got to do
is make the transaction.

698
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,270
Thirty-five million.

699
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,310
Someone has got
to relieve Brakes.

700
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:24,380
Alright.

701
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,681
I'm going home.

702
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,450
They didn't pay.

703
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:04,020
You've got to be
kidding me.

704
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:07,256
What do you mean
they didn't pay?

705
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,826
Last night
was the deadline.

706
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:12,395
<i>We told them
that we would kill you</i>

707
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:13,896
<i>if they didn't pay.</i>

708
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,665
And they didn't
fucking pay!

709
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,901
So time's up!
Okay.

710
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:22,738
There must be
some confusion.

711
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,709
<i>It's confusion,
that's it.</i>

712
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:29,979
Damn, I'm their boss!
Nobody else.

713
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,647
Must be out
of their fucking minds.

714
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:32,982
I'll fire them all!

715
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,750
Give me a pen
and paper.

716
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:36,352
<i>Give me a pen
and paper now!</i>

717
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,421
And you're all fired!
You as well.

718
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,022
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>you'll get</i>
<i>your blood money.</i>

719
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,357
You know you will.
You have my word
of honor.

720
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,559
Okay? Okay?!

721
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,394
<i>You fucking morons!</i>

722
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,864
Yeah.
What's his problem?

723
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,432
What?

724
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:50,833
Now you
listen to me.

725
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,469
<i>Can we also have your...</i>

726
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,071
Ooh.

727
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:57,640
Can we also have
your word of honor

728
00:47:57,642 --> 00:48:00,543
right now, in writing,

729
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:04,013
that when you're free,
you won't help the police
in any way?

730
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:06,983
<i>My word of honor?</i>
Yeah.

731
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:12,421
Yeah. That's the way
the game is played.

732
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,891
<i>You've got
my word.</i>

733
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:17,253
<i>It's time to end
it now, okay?</i>

734
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,424
<i>Hello?</i>

735
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,796
<i>W... why is the door open?
Hello?</i>

736
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:58,034
<i>Ab, is that you?</i>

737
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,403
Boss?
<i>Yeah.</i>

738
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:01,570
Boss, are
you alright?
<i>Yeah, I'm sort</i>
<i>of okay.</i>

739
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,806
Tired of this crap.

740
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:06,642
Oh, God.
Um...

741
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:09,445
Are you okay?
Have they left you alone
or given you a rough time?

742
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,614
I don't know,
I... I... I...

743
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,883
How long have we
been in here now?

744
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:15,818
<i>A month?</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I've lost track.</i>

745
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,054
<i>I'm a little confused,
it feels longer.</i>

746
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,789
<i>Now, now,
I'll tell you now.</i>

747
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,926
<i>It comes to...</i>

748
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,328
<i>oh, almost
three weeks.</i>

749
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,998
Yeah.

750
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,833
Why the hell
are you here?

751
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:33,002
You've got no money
to offer these jokers.

752
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,104
<i>Well, if...</i>

753
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:38,474
<i>if your people
don't pay,</i>

754
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,576
<i>then, uh, then these
guys need to prove</i>

755
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,046
<i>that they're not
fooling around and...</i>

756
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:46,148
<i>well, it can't be
your head...</i>

757
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,086
<i>they'll send</i>
<i>to the police</i>
<i>in a box.</i>

758
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,821
<i>Don't worry, Ab.
We'll...</i>

759
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,823
<i>pay whatever
it takes.</i>

760
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,025
<i>If it's</i>
<i>a hundred million,</i>
<i>we'll pay.</i>

761
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,594
<i>I want to get out of this
as much as you guys.</i>

762
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:01,998
<i>But we have to let</i>
<i>them sweat it out</i>
<i>another week.</i>

763
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,701
<i>Let them believe</i>
<i>that their screw-up</i>
<i>killed Heineken.</i>

764
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:09,071
You remind me again
why we grabbed
the driver.

765
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:11,107
Why?
What's your point?

766
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,809
<i>A question</i>
<i>the police</i>
<i>are asking.</i>

767
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:17,046
Is, uh... are these guys
the real deal?

768
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:20,716
Or are they just
a bunch of pussies?

769
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:26,722
And if the answer is
they're a bunch
of pussies,

770
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,190
<i>they're going to string
this out forever.</i>

771
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:31,093
So what are you
trying to say?

772
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:34,463
Well, we said
if they don't pay,
then there'll be blood.

773
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:38,667
You wrote that
in the letter.

774
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:41,570
<i>This is business.</i>

775
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:44,473
It's nothing personal.

776
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:51,047
And they didn't
fucking pay.

777
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,848
- I agree.
<i>- Oh, really?</i>

778
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,219
<i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah?

779
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,721
Yeah?
You agree?
Yeah.

780
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,189
<i>With him?</i>

781
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:01,957
Alright, good.
Big man,

782
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,260
alright then,
slice his fucking throat.

783
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,986
I'll do it.

784
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,628
<i>Willem...</i>

785
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,897
<i>Hey. Hey. Hey.</i>

786
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:43,566
<i>You're acting</i>
<i>like a scared</i>
<i>little boy.</i>

787
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,134
Hey, you
fucking do it!

788
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:48,003
<i>A scared little boy.</i>

789
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:50,906
Fuck!

790
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:52,842
I didn't sign up for this!

791
00:51:52,844 --> 00:51:54,877
Cor, if he
does anything...

792
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,946
anything!

793
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,114
If he does
anything in there,

794
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:00,616
it's fucking
on you.

795
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,051
Do something!

796
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:03,185
Fuck.

797
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,559
Man!

798
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,827
Use your head!

799
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:13,229
Oh, fuck.

800
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,178
Oh, fuck.

801
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,720
You alright?

802
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,289
Stop what you're doing.

803
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,057
What are you doing?

804
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,860
What are
you doing?

805
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,094
What are you doing?

806
00:53:19,096 --> 00:53:20,729
Come here.
Come on.

807
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:21,997
Come on.

808
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,181
Is he alright?

809
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:40,749
Yeah, no,
he's okay.

810
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,785
He's fine.

811
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,054
We all just need
to go home,

812
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,922
take a breather,

813
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,291
get drunk, get laid,
whatever you got to do.

814
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:51,827
<i>But we</i>
<i>just got to stick</i>
<i>to the routine</i>

815
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,196
<i>and we'll see each other
in a few days.</i>

816
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:56,131
Alright.
Let's go.

817
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,681
<i>...in a case that has riveted
the nation and much of Europe,</i>

818
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,850
<i>the kidnapping</i>
<i>of billionaire</i>
<i>Alfred Heineken</i>

819
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,919
<i>has entered
its 19th day.</i>

820
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:19,955
<i>With no substantial leads
and no end in sight,</i>

821
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:23,192
<i>a massive manhunt involving</i>
<i>local and federal law</i>
<i>enforcement continues.</i>

822
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,968
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

823
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,771
Where've you been?

824
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,973
You were supposed
to be at birth class.
<i>What?</i>

825
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,142
No, S...
Fuck.

826
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,177
<i>No, no, no.</i>

827
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,380
Sonja!
Listen, I'm sorry.

828
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,981
Listen, I'll make
it up to you!

829
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:47,416
Alright?
I'll make it up to you.

830
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,752
Sonja...

831
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,468
Have they paid?
Am I to be set free?

832
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,894
Did you give them
my message?

833
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:36,098
You know,
they have
one more chance.

834
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,534
If they screw it
up this time...

835
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:40,235
And they know
I've given you
my word

836
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:43,038
so they will pay, so...

837
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,841
how are you planning
to set us free?

838
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:49,812
<i>I will put
the both of you in a car</i>

839
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,780
and, uh,
leave it somewhere.

840
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:53,248
Call your people.

841
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,151
Oh, good.

842
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:58,053
<i>Listen, if your people
don't pay soon,</i>

843
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,556
then I can't answer
for my people.

844
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,124
<i>I'll tell you what.
If you put us</i>

845
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,827
in that car
right now, I'll, uh...

846
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:06,929
see to it that you get
what you want and...

847
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:10,332
I'll make sure
you're free to spend it.

848
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:13,135
That's a promise
and I have the power
to do that.

849
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,371
You know?

850
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:18,841
Of course.

851
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:21,009
You're a young man
and I must confess,
I do envy you.

852
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,931
There's no way
you could have
done this without...

853
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:27,983
no way you could have
done it without those
men in your life

854
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:32,454
that you trust
with your life.
Friends.

855
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:36,525
So congratulations,
well done, and uh...

856
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:38,260
soon you'll get
your money

857
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:44,433
and then you will be...
very, very rich.

858
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,568
But, um...

859
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,004
But what?

860
00:56:49,006 --> 00:56:53,108
No, what I meant
to say, my friend,
is that, uh...

861
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,310
there are two ways
a man can be rich
in this world.

862
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:58,447
He can have
a lot of money

863
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:02,217
or he can have
a lot of friends.

864
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,585
But he cannot have both.

865
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:28,310
<i>Cor?</i>

866
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,045
Yeah?

867
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,613
<i>Rub my back?</i>

868
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:36,136
<i>Please?</i>
Yeah, yeah,
I will later.

869
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,153
<i>Yes.</i>

870
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,158

Have a look.
It's the police.

966
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:56,424

<i>What are we
going to do?</i>

976
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,668
They don't know
where the money is.

977
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,937
So, Cor,
how long we got
before they do?

978
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:43,705
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>
Where?

979
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:45,040
<i>To dig up the money

980
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:47,375

<i>Well, I don't know!</i>

983
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,649
What do you got?

984
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,017
What have you got?
Come on, think.

985
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:57,786
Alright,
I'm thinking...

986
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,688
Come on,
come on!
Alright, alright!

987
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:01,656
I think me and Willem
go and we get
the money.

988
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:03,792
<i>The five of us
can't stay in this car</i>

989
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:05,760
<i>so Willem and I are</i>
<i>going to ditch</i>
<i>the car</i>

990
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:07,696
<i>and then we
dig up the money.</i>

991
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:10,432
Then I think what,
we meet you guys
in four hours?

992
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,167
The boatyard.
Out at Newlake.

993
01:06:12,169 --> 01:06:14,602
That's good,
that's good.

994
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:18,473
<i>No, we can't be
worrying about Heineken.</i>

995
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,474
There's no point
in worrying about
him now.

996
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,716
Fucking go! Go!

997
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,015
<i>Where are you doing?</i>
I'm coming with you.

998
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:28,850
Better get out

your fucking neck.

999
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,885
Just be careful.
Don't go home.
Promise me.

1000
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:33,722
Okay.
Okay.

1001
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:34,990

They're not here.

1005
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,883
They are not here.

1006
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:03,184
They took
all our money.

1007
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:05,620
Did you knock
on the door?

1008
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:08,690
No, I didn't
fucking knock
on the door.

1009
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:09,892
Why should I
knock on the door?

1010
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:11,192
Where are their cars?

1011
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:17,565
They're not here.

1012
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,670
Hey.
Hey, come in.

1013
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:30,745
Yeah, what's wrong
with him?

1014
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:31,913
What's right with him?

1015
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,663
Here.

1016
01:07:48,665 --> 01:07:49,964
Shit, that's way
too much.

1017
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:51,733
Now come on,
you deserve it.

1018
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,975
Here, come here.
I want to talk to you.

1019
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,241
What's up?

1020
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,243
I want you
to take this money

1021
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:04,746
and I want you
to hide it in
the next 20 minutes.

1022
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,981
Yeah, but I'll come
with you, right?
No.

1023
01:08:06,983 --> 01:08:09,017
What do you mean?

1024
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:12,053
Listen, you'll be fine.

1025
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:13,822
Look, I love you.

1026
01:08:13,824 --> 01:08:15,957
Which means I want
what's best for you.

1027
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:19,194
Now you listen to what
I've got to say. Alright?

1028
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:21,830
Okay, good.
You'll be fine.

1029
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:24,766
You take this,

1030
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,968
and you make life
work for you, alright?

1031
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,938
Go on. Go on, get
the fuck out of here!

1032
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,673
You'll find me, yeah?
Yeah, of course.

1033
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:33,635
You promise?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,091
<i>Money's too heavy.</i>

1037
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:53,161
We had to leave
a sack in that drum.

1038
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,630
You did what?

1039
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,065
<i>Oh, come on.
You didn't even notice.</i>

1040
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:59,000
Look at this, look!

in the ground?</i>

1042
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,870
Seven fucking million?

1043
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:02,904
Yeah, we'll get the rest
when we come back.

1044
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,706
<i>Come back?</i>

1045
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:06,708
I have a friend,
they live in Paris.

1046
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,209
We're going...
<i>We're going</i>
<i>to stay there</i>

1047
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:11,880
until everything's
calmed down.

1048
01:09:11,882 --> 01:09:14,282
Well, I can't.

1049
01:09:14,284 --> 01:09:16,084
What do you mean?

1050
01:09:16,086 --> 01:09:18,853
I can't stay
in fucking Paris.

1051
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,788
<i>Cor, I got a family.</i>

1052
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,856
I got kids.

1053
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,996
What about
Mr. Heineken?

1054
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,698
Mr. Heineken!
<i>Answer me!</i>

1055
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,135
You let Heineken out now
they will grab you, man.

1056
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:36,271
If we don't,
he'll fucking die.

1057
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,640
Well, once we get
to Paris,

1058
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:40,775
we can call
his people,
tip them off.

1059
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,844
If they find him in Cat's shed,
then we can't ever go back.

1060
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,612
Think about that?
Come on, think
about it!

1061
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:47,182
Jesus, man.
You leave half
your brain

1062
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,883
out in that whole
with the rest
of my money?

1063
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,318
It's safe.
It's fucking safe!

1064
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,686
It'll never be safe.

1065
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:53,855
<i>It's safe!</i>
No!

1066
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,990
Don't you get
it, Cor?

1067
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,926
It'll never be safe.
Not here.

1068
01:09:57,928 --> 01:10:00,128
<i>Not in Paris.</i>

1069
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,664
<i>We're lucky</i>
<i>if we can hang</i>
<i>out in Timbuktu.</i>

1070
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:05,033
Take your fucking money,
take it! Take it!

1071
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,368
We were worth
a lot more than that.

1072
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,960
I'll see you
on the outside.

1073
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,723
What about you?

1074
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,391
<i>Coming with us?</i>

1075
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,659
Yeah, I'll come.

1076
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:52,714
<i>Shit.</i>

1077
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:10,798
Halt!

1078
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,155
Can you hear me, Ab?
Wherever you are.

1079
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:10,525
Ah. Come on, John.

1080
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:14,796
Sing with me,
get your mind
off all this rubbish.

1081
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:18,833
Any song,
what is it?

1082
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,425
Are you the police?

1083
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:45,927
<i>What the hell took you so long?</i>

1084
01:12:45,929 --> 01:12:47,428
I'm alright.
Just my friend, Ab,

1085
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,197
my chauffeur,
go and get him, please.

1086
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,332
That's it,
go and get him!
Ab, it's over!

1087
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:52,934
<i>He's in there!</i>

1088
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:54,569
<i>Ab, you okay?
It's over!</i>

1089
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,337
<i>It's over!</i>
Are you okay, sir?

1090
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:57,405
Jesus Christ,
it's over!

1091
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,006
Oh, God!

1092
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:05,380
Fuck.

1093
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,248
Ah.

1094
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,952
Oh, thank you, God.

1095
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:12,587
Ab, you...

1096
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,957
Oh.

1097
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:22,497
Thank you, God.

1098
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,932
<i>Kidnapped billionaire,
Alfred Heineken,</i>

1099
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:27,935

<i>in a police raid</i>

1100
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,338
<i>Both Heineken</i>
<i>and his driver,</i>
<i>Ab Doderer,</i>

1101

1102
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:35,510
<i>They were
apparently unharmed...</i>

1103
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:37,979
<i>I don't know.</i>

1104
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,881
<i>Maybe it was</i>
<i>the ransom note</i>
<i>we left in the copier.</i>

1105
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:43,203
Or all that Bang
Bang chicken
or maybe...

1106
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:49,557
Listen, I'm not
saying he did, but...

1107
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:51,993
maybe Brakes
could have
said something...

1108
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,061
Wait, wait, wait.
What did you say?

1109
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:56,097
I'm not saying
Brakes did,
I'm just saying...

1110
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,366
Yeah, no, no,
I hear what
you're saying.

1111
01:13:58,368 --> 01:14:01,135
Maybe you all thought
he was fucking you,
did you think about that?

1112
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:02,617
<i>- -details of
the rescue...</i>

1113
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,276
Ah, fuck.
These are horse blankets.

1114
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:10,144
So?
So what?

1115
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:11,379
<i>I'm allergic.</i>

1116
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:13,247
I stop breathing.

1117
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:15,283
You promise?

1118
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,918
I'm sick
of you complaining!

1119
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:20,988
Alright, just calm down!

1120
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:25,092
What the fuck?

1121
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:34,469
Just fucking stop it!

1122
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,404
Look, just stop it...!

1123
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,475
Get out of my car!

1124
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,543
Just take it easy!
Take it easy!

1125
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,178
Hold it together!
Listen.

1126
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,581
This fucking car...!

1127
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,217
Look, just
hold it together!
You want your money?
Take your money.

1128
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:51,352
Calm the fuck down.
We haven't got time
for this shit!

1129
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:52,653
You, get in the car.

1130
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:55,022
No way.
Not me!

1131
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:56,991
I'm out of here!
Spikes, get
in the fucking car.

1132
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,125
Let him go.
Spikes.

1133
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:00,061
Fuck him.
Come on.

1134
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:01,195
Can't even
pick up his bag.
Spikes.
Spikes!

1135
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:03,264
Come on, Cor.

1136
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,366
Look, Spikes!

1137
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:06,534
<i>You're not going
to make two fucking miles!</i>

1138
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:09,470
I'll make 10,000.

1139
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,539
Come on, Cor.
Come with me.

1140
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:13,107
What are you doing?
<i>Let him</i>
<i>have the car.</i>

1141
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:14,675
You're not going
to make it without us.

1142
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,611
Just get
in the car, alright?

1143
01:15:16,613 --> 01:15:18,533
You stay with that asshole,
he'll get you killed.

1144
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:32,660
<i>Come on, Spikes!</i>

1145
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:35,563
Look, Spikes!

1146
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:38,065
<i>Oh, fuck it.</i>

1147
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:55,142
Fuck!

1148
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,706
Okay, bye.

1149
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:00,675
This evening.
She's going to meet
us this evening.

1150
01:18:00,677 --> 01:18:03,177
Are you sure
she's cool?

1151
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,245
Oh, she's cool.

1152
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:12,319
Listen, I think
I'm going to call Sonja.

1153
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:13,654
You leave
my sister
out of this.

1154
01:18:13,656 --> 01:18:16,791
Look, I won't
be long.
Wait.

1155
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,659
No, I'm serious.
You put her
in this shit

1156
01:18:18,661 --> 01:18:20,361
and they're going
to know where
we are.

1157
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:23,731
I've got to make
sure she's all right.

1158
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:25,900
Alright, fine.

1159
01:18:25,902 --> 01:18:28,803
Well, you
make the call...

1160
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,905
I'm out of here.

1161
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:33,107
Seriously,
you're on your own.

1162
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:40,448
Alright.
Come on.

1163
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:41,515
Let's go.

1164
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,486
What's this place
like, anyway?

1165
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,555
It's, uh,
it's nice.

1166
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:49,156
But it's safe.

1167
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:51,518
That's all
that matters.

1168
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:02,662
Forget about it.
Come back!
I'm coming.

1169
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,341
Hi.

1170
01:19:07,343 --> 01:19:09,463
Hey.
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to make some coffee.</i>

1171
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,787
<i>What's going on?</i>

1172
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:25,659
Front page.

1173
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:31,332
<i>Spikes turned
himself in.</i>

1174
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,868
<i>"God told me
to burn the money."</i>

1175
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,636
<i>Ha.
He's insane.</i>

1176
01:19:35,638 --> 01:19:39,640
Or he's smart.

1177
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:42,710
He's going to do
15 years at least.

1178
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:44,779
Well, that's one way
to play it.

1179
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:48,916
You think you could
play it like that?

1180
01:19:48,918 --> 01:19:55,456
No, God doesn't talk
to me that much.

1181
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:58,738
Oh, yeah.
He looks
like an idiot.

1182
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:02,296
<i>Mr. Heineken, it's been
over two months</i>

1183
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:03,798
<i>since you were released.
Looking back,</i>

1184
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,433
<i>what was
your biggest fear?</i>

1185
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:08,936
<i>My biggest fear was
for my driver, Ab Doderer.</i>

1186
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:11,672
<i>Because he
suffered most...</i>

1187
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:15,976
<i>and we both knew who
was really expendable.</i>

1188
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,679
<i>Did they ever threaten
to kill you?</i>

1189
01:20:18,681 --> 01:20:20,648
<i>I honestly believe
that they believed</i>

1190
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,750
<i>it was</i>
<i>a business deal,</i>
<i>nothing more.</i>

1191
01:20:22,752 --> 01:20:24,418
<i>Where do you think
Cor Van Hout</i>

1192
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,719
<i>and Willem Holleeder
are now?</i>

1193
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:27,755
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1194
01:20:27,757 --> 01:20:30,558
<i>As the great fighter
Joe Louis used to say,</i>

1195
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,027
<i>"You can run
but you cannot hide."</i>

1196
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,930
<i>We'll get them.
Thank you.</i>

1197
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,767
Hm.

1198
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,672
I'm going
to have to phone Sonja.

1199
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:45,914
You can't do that.

1200
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,627
I told you,
you can't do that.

1201
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:35,322
<i>What about that one? Huh?</i>

1202
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,424
- That one's perfect.
- <i> What about it?</i>

1203
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:41,328
Well, you know, it's
got those tall windows
that you like.

1204
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,690
I bet it's got a big
backyard for the kid.

1205
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,601
<i>If we're buying
fancy houses,</i>

1206
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:49,336
we might as well buy
one for Willem next door,

1207
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:50,838
otherwise I'll never
see either of you.

1208
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,080
Now he can buy
his own.

1209
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,545
You're never even
going to try to live

1210
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,227
in the real world,
are you?

1211
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,861
Yeah, hello.

1212
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:15,863
<i>Karin, look, it's me.</i>

1213
01:22:15,865 --> 01:22:17,998
<i>Don't hang up.</i>
Cor?

1214
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,833
Now, listen to me.

1215
01:22:19,835 --> 01:22:21,602
I'm going to give
you a number

1216
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:22,937
and I need you
to tell Sonja

1217
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,439
to call me
as soon as she can.

1218
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,474
<i>from a phone box</i>
<i>some way over</i>
<i>from the house.</i>

1219
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:29,376
<i>You understand?</i>
Where are you?

1220
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,512
<i>Listen to me.
Listen to me, please.</i>

1221
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:35,015
Promise me,
look, it's for her.

1222
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,635
- Hello?
<i>- What did you do, Cor?</i>

1223
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,804
What the hell
did you do?

1224
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:59,573
Don't start that now,
we haven't got
time for that.

1225
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:02,509
Look, there's no time...
<i>Cor, what the hell</i>
<i>did you do?</i>

1226
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:04,411
<i>Cor, where are you?</i>

1227
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:06,013
<i>Answer me, Cor.</i>

1228
01:23:06,015 --> 01:23:09,683
<i>Where...?
Cor?</i>

1229
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:11,051
<i>Cor?
Where...?</i>

1230
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,988
<i>Where are you?</i>

1231
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:15,522
Sonja?

1232
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:17,458
Son... Sonja, are you there?

1233
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,060
<i>Sonja, Sonja!</i>
I'm here.
I'm here, Cor.

1234
01:23:20,062 --> 01:23:22,796
<i>Cor, Cor, this is...</i>

1235
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:27,568
they follow
me everywhere.

1236
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:32,940
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to hear your voice.</i>

1237
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:35,075
If I buy a loaf
of bread,

1238
01:23:35,077 --> 01:23:39,580
they check my money
in case it's...

1239
01:23:39,582 --> 01:23:41,982
I want to be
where you are.

1240
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,071
<i>Please.</i>

1241
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,995
Soon, Son, soon.

1242
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,831
Listen,

1243
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:01,535
after the baby,
I can come back, alright?

1244
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,203
<i>Soon.
That's a promise.</i>

1245
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,639
You promise?

1246
01:24:05,641 --> 01:24:07,641
<i>I promise.</i>

1247
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:09,943
<i>I promise,</i>
<i>I promise,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

1248
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:13,147
<i>Listen to me,
okay, Son, listen?</i>

1249
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:15,849
We're going to be
a real family.
You know?

1250
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,052
We'll be
a real family

1251
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:21,789
and I'm going to give you
everything you ever wanted.

1252
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:26,727
And believe me.

1253
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,496
Huh, you believe me?
<i>I believe you.</i>

1254
01:24:29,498 --> 01:24:34,535
But Cor, do you know
how big this thing is?

1255
01:24:34,537 --> 01:24:36,770
They've arrested everybody
you ever met in your life.

1256
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:38,939
They bugged
all the phones.

1257
01:24:38,941 --> 01:24:40,841
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean everyone?</i>

1258
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:43,177
<i>Like Arthur
and my parents,</i>

1259
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:47,214
<i>Your parents?</i>
all your friends,
all of mine,
everybody's.

1260
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:50,951
<i>Cor, I've got to go.</i>

1261
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:52,086
I love you.

1262
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:53,854
Okay?
Be safe.

1263
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,856
No, don't hang up!
Don't hang up!

1264
01:24:55,858 --> 01:24:58,018
- Son, don't hang up!
- <i> I love you!</i>

1265
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:37,264
I, uh...

1266
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:38,632
I think I messed up.

1267
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:44,304
I think they have
this number...

1268
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,572
since last night.

1269
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:50,043
Just letting you know.

1270
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,451
We better get
our stuff then.

1271
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,785
<i>Willem, wait.</i>

1272
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:36,223
<i>Something feels wrong.</i>

1273
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:39,259
<i>It seems too quiet.</i>

1274
01:27:06,121 --> 01:27:08,755
You want to do this?

1275
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:11,725
You know,
I think I'll sit
this one out.

1276
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:13,660
In prison?

1277
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:15,963
Look, we can get out
while we're still young.

1278
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:17,998
They'll never find
the money.

1279
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:21,868
You want to bet?

1280
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,940
You know I do.

1281
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:16,216
<i>There are two ways a man
can be rich in this world.</i>

1282
01:29:16,218 --> 01:29:18,285
<i>He can have
a lot of money...</i>

1283
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:21,555
<i>or he can have
a lot of friends.</i>

1284
01:29:21,557 --> 01:29:23,824
<i>But he cannot have both.</i>
