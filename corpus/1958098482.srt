<i>In 1979, this appellation</i>

7
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,453

8

9

10
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:01,228

00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,831
<i>Romance, and off-beat fun</i>

12
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,667

37
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,400
<i>I had a chance to catch up</i>

38
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,535

40
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:21,709
<i>Now in my playin' days,</i>
<i>Coach Hodge Griffin</i>

41
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,845
<i>was the head ball coach here.</i>

42
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,482
<i>Now, we didn't play the game</i>
<i>from 1942 till '45,</i>

43
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,183
<i>'cause of World War II.</i>

44
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:34,187
<i>And on the eve of that game,</i>
<i>word got back around</i>

45
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,323
<i>to Coach Randy Hale</i>
<i>over Tennessee A&M,</i>

46
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,792
<i>that Coach Hodge said,</i>

47
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,228
<i>he would rather kiss</i>
<i>a Nazi girl on the lips</i>

48
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,665
<i>than lose to Tennessee A&M.</i>

49
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>Well, that next day,</i>

50
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,969

<i>45 to nothing.</i>

52
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,773
Dang,
Coach Redd ain't playin'.

53
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,942
I heard Coach Redd
tell that story

54
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:56,744
at the Kiwanis Club.

55
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,846

56
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,850
Dang, I'm gettin'
my butt kicked, ain't I?

57
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,418
You sound surprised, Daddy.

58
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,953

What? Oh, that-- that's it.

67
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:37,785
Baby, I'm done.

68
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,754

Oh, Daddy,
it's only 10:00 o'clock!

70
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,457
Says the person
who doesn't get up

71
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,659
at 6:00 a.m. every morning.

72
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,227
Yeah, it's only 10:00 o'clock.

73
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,429
You're right.

74
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:54,367
I swear I've never laid eyes
on anyone as lucky as you.

75
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,005
You know how you're so lucky?

76
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,775
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm your daddy.

77
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,612
Alright, goodnight.

78
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,647

War damn Seahawk.

84
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,863
War damn Seahawk, Daddy.

85
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,831

<i>Now, Linda, the mood here</i>

92
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,917
<i>Behind me are numerous--</i>

93
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,720
<i>Well, I can't exactly</i>
<i>call them "protesters".</i>

94
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,421
<i>Some of them are wearing</i>
<i>commemorative T-shirts,</i>

95
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,390
<i>which celebrate</i>
<i>tonight's execution.</i>

96

<i>Now, Linda, if you're wondering</i>
<i>about the T-shirts,</i>

97
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,428
<i>those are the creation</i>

101
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,905
<i>Well, listen, I run me a store</i>
<i>up there in Hackleburg</i>

102
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,438
<i>called Hank's Good Stuff.</i>

103
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:08,075
<i>I've been in business</i>
<i>about 1966.</i>

104
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,978
<i>And my friend Marty Dixon</i>

<i>of this killin' spree.</i>

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,949
<i>And I thought it right fit</i>
<i>that I'd come out here tonight</i>

107
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,552
<i>Celebrate old Marty's life</i>

It has.

145
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:06,594
Not since that court room

Yeah.

147
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,931
Come.

148
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,733
I'll be honest uh,

00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,835
I wasn't sure

150
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,506
It's my duty to be here.

Hell, I'm glad you are.

152
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,477
I don't reckon

Not yet, ma'am.

161
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,152
I hope this brings you justice.

162
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,298
Welcome.
I am Warden Glenn Haskins.

163

Those of you here to

of Jakkariah Dubose Harding.

165
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:59,340
This execution
is to take place at midnight,

166
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,576
11 years to the day
Harding committed

167
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,880
these terrible crimes
in October of 1968.

168
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,582
The victims,
may they rest in peace,

169

18-year-old Beth Ann Studebaker,

172

39-year-old Marty Dixon,

173
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,034
and 22-year-old Lou Ann Newton.

174
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,705
State of Alabama
sentenced him to death

175
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,240
by electric chair.

176
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,044
It's customary in this state

177
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:39,947
to let the inmate say
a few final words

178
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,116
before he leaves this world,

179
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:45,686
but seeing how Harding
hasn't spoken a single word

180
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,657
since he was arrested,
I'm not holding my breath.

181
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:53,194
Let's see.

182
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,099
So, do you have anything to say
to the victims' families?

183
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:07,509
Just nod your head.

184
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,243
Are you sorry
for what you've done?

185
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,819
I didn't think so.

186
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,072
Burn!

187
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,340
Burn!

188
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:43,410
Burn! Burn! Burn!

189
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:44,311
Burn in hell!

190
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:47,248
- Yeah, let him burn!
- Burn in hell!

191
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,815

192
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,289

194

Die! Die!

195
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,041
He's dead.

196
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,111
Justice's been served.

197
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,487
Hear the horn? He's dead!

198
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:11,358
Yeah!

199
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,128
He's burning in hell!

200
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,244
Lets go break out...
Come on!

201
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,012
Come on!

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,928
You're welcome
to attend the burial

203
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,930
if you can put up
with this weather.

204
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,899
They're buryin' him tonight?

205
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:52,966
Yes, ma'am.

206
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,869
Are there any other guards
gonna be there?

207
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,540
Well, no, sir. He's dead

208
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,910
Are you gonna go
to the gravesite?

209
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,315
I suppose
I should go, too, then.

210
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,020
Only on one condition,
you're riding with me.

211
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,090
Burn in hell!
Burn in hell!

212
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,226
Burn in hell! Burn in hell!

213
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,894
Burn in hell!

214
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:23,598
Burn in hell! Burn in hell!

215
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,440
We gotta get
to the cemetery.

216
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,377
They're holdin' us up, man.

217
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,580
Come on, people,
get out the way!

218
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,549
We're gonna lose them,
Ricky Dean.

219
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,250
Are you kidding me?

220
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,520
Look, get out the way!

221
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:48,489
Come on! Move!

222
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,665
Those people make me sick.

223
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,038
You mind?

224
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,609
No, go ahead.

225
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,557
You know,
it's really somethin'

226
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,292
that we were
the only ones there.

227
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:30,030
not a single family member
for Harding.

228
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,035
No sister. No brother.

229
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,506
No prison wife. Nothin'.

230
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,077
They say he was
a drifter back in '68.

231
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,180
No next of kin.

232
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,348
No friends.

233
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,353
The man never said
one single solitary word.

234
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:02,362
Damn,
I have never seen so much fog.

235
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,612
There's the hearse
right there.

236
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,119
I've never seen fog like that.

237
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,622
That's not normal.

238
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,158
Unfortunately, there's
something evil in that fog.

239
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,728
Open the glove box.

240
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:56,243
I want you to lock all the doors
when I get out.

241
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:59,714
And don't open 'em
for nobody but me.

242
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,617
If I don't come back,
Vicki Newton,

243
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,251
you get over here
in this driver's side

244
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,253

out of here.

245

You're saying that you think
he's still alive, aren't you?

246
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,825
I know he is.

247
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,829
Lock the door.

00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:01,882
Well, how else would
you explain it, Mr. Logan?

348
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,885
Electrocuted men
don't just get up and walk away.

349
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,853
Don't you walk
your ass in there

350
00:28:05,886 --> 00:28:08,022
and call the proper authorities
and the media,

351
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:09,123
and let them know
what's comin' in.

352
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:10,991
This is not a media concern.

353
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,459
and we will
let the authorities know

354
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,028
on a need-to-know basis.

355
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:15,396
Well, I tell you this.

356
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,498
When I get to Hackleburg,
I'll call the media.

357
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:20,034
Well, good luck on your
little crusade, Mr. Logan,

358
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:22,269
as long as you keep
the media out of this.

359
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:24,104
Because as far as
they're concerned,

360
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:27,241
Jack Dubose Harding
is resting peacefully,

361
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,475
6 feet under.

362
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,744
What are you tryin' to prove?

363
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:33,080
You tryin' to get
your other hand broke?

364
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,316
Or wind up dead
like them poor other fellows?

365
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:38,052
Somebody's gotta stop him,
Vicki Newton,

366
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,153
and that somebody is me.

367
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:44,191
Well, looks like you're gonna
need an extra set of hands.

368
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,264
You know what?

369
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:51,332
If you're goin',

370
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,167
you're goin' for the long haul,
Vicki Newton.

371
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,268
You know what you're doin',
right?

372
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,837
You're sayin' my full name

373
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,039
every time
you say somethin' to me.

374
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:02,176
It's always Vicki Newton, this,
Vicki Newton, that.

375
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:04,478
Four hundred times since we've
been together, Vicki Newton.

376
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:05,980
I don't know what you mean,
Vicki--

377
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:06,981
- See?
- Um--

378
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,817
You was about to do it
right then and there.

379
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,186
Look...

380
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,187
Is there a problem?

381
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:17,057
Well, how would you like it
if I called you Ricky Dean Logan

382
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:19,260
every single time
I said somethin' to you,

383
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:20,194
Ricky Dean Logan?

384
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:22,830
How would you like that,
Ricky Dean Logan?

385
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,398
You know what?

386
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:28,068
I think it'd be quite nice,
Vicki Newton.

387
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,438
Now, come on, let's go.

388
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,340
Let's get out of here.

389
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,257
Yeah.

390
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,559
Pick something good there,
Denver.

391
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:52,826
Yeah.

392
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:05,105
I'm starving.

393
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,449
<i>♪ Come to me slowly </i>

394
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:19,186
<i>♪ So, I can see your eyes </i>

395
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:23,891
Dang, you're the
danciest woman I ever saw.

396
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,259
Thank you.

397
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:28,896
Excuse you.

398
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,632
Well, howdy, y'all,
welcome to Bronco Burger.

399
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:31,465
My name's Heather

400
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,534
and I'll be
y'all's cowpoke today.

401
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,436
Our house specials
include the Buckin' Bronc' combo

402
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:37,371
with Bronco Soda
and Stallion Fries.

403
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,238
If that don't suit ya,

404
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,873
I can get y'all some menus
out here.

405
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,042
You are so precious.

406
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:44,278
Do you say that to everyone
who comes here?

407
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,614
Yes, ma'am, I'm supposed to.

408
00:30:46,748 --> 00:30:48,449
Though I can't say
I always do it.

409
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,050
Just to folks
I ain't seen here before.

410
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:51,218
Oh, well,
you pegged us, honey,

411
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,020
'cause we ain't from round here.

412
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:56,023
Oh, yeah?
Where are y'all from?

413
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,025
Well, see now,
I'm just from over in Huntsville

414
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,160
and uh, these are my friends
from out of state.

415
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,329
We're stayin' over
at my Uncle Deeter's place,

416
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:04,865
just partying,
and carrying on and such.

417
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,368
This is my good friend uh,
Neddy the Teddy.

418
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,303
We call him that, 'cause he's
a big old teddy bear.

419
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:10,270
Hmm.

420
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:13,474
No. No. It's Ned.

421
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,644
Just Ned.
Nobody calls me that.

422
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:17,878
Sure, sure, Neddy Teddy.

423
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:21,448
Uh, and this looker right here
is our friend Pam the Glam,

424
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:23,283
and this bedhead
behind me is Denver.

425
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,251
Oh!

426
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:27,287
Are you from Colorado,

427
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:29,657
'cause I've always
wanted to go there?

428
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:33,193
No, I'm from Utah.

429
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:35,229
We just call her "Denver",

430
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:37,164
'cause she loves
John Denver so much.

431
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,265
Oh, yeah.

432
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,134
Big fan.

433
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,470
Uh, pardon us,
we're just cuttin' up.

434
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,673
Uh, we're all
old college buddies from UAM.

435
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:48,041
And we just ain't been together
in quite a spell.

436
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:50,978
Well, welcome to Hackleburg.
We're glad to have ya.

437
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:53,313
Say, listen, I'll--

438
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:54,481
I'll grab y'all
a couple of menus, alright?

439
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:57,284
And uh, could you bring us
a round of that Bronco Soda.

440
00:31:57,317 --> 00:32:00,254
I ain't never been to a place
that got their own sodas before.

441
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,423
If you like Dr. Pepper,
you'll just love it.

442
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:03,691
- Hmm.
- Comin' right up.

443
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,492
Okay, Bronco Soda.

444
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,127
Bronco.

445
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:09,963
Hey, she's pretty cute, huh?

446
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,133
Howdy doo, everybody?

447
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,736
- Hey, Sheriff!
- Hey, Sheriff!

448
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,203
War damn Seahawk.

449
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:17,371
- War damn Seahawk!
- War damn Seahawk!

450
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,039
Hawk.

451
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:22,610
What's a Seahawk?

452
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,712
Guys, straighten up.

453
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:27,281
He-- he's right behind us.

454
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,651
No, the other way.

455
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,754
Oh, yeah.

456
00:32:32,787 --> 00:32:35,355
Hey, Sheriff,
you're awfully late today.

457
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:39,594
Had a sick cow
down at the farm this morning.

458
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,529
But I'm here now.

459
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:44,164
Would be here
in my office for uh,

460
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:46,099
in case anybody needs us.

461
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,001
You want your usual?

462
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,671

481
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:25,807

- Meow! Meow.
- Meow.

488
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,661
Y'all straighten up, alright?
Kick us out of here.

00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:48,095
- Meow!
- Meow!

490
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,821
This is a livin' nightmare.

491
00:34:48,155 --> 00:34:49,657
I'm gonna need you
to have to pinch me,

492
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:51,793
so that I know it's real.

493
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:54,629
It's real, alright,
Vicki Newton.

494
00:34:56,731 --> 00:34:59,132
I'm sorry,
that's just the way I talk.

495
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,803
No, it's fine.

496
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,176
I've been afraid

497
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:11,278
something like this
would happen.

498
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:12,880
What do you mean?

499
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,652
Like that night, back in '68.

500
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:25,158
You know, I chased him
out of my house, right?

501
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:29,162
Yeah.
I remember somethin' like that.

502
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:32,567
But did you know,
Vicki Newton,

503
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,703
I shot him twice
with my shotgun?

504
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,707
And later on,
they come a telling me

505
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:42,543
I shot him with birdshot
and not buckshot.

506
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,879
That's bullshit, Vicki Newton!

507
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:48,616
It wasn't no birdshot,
no way in hell!

508
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,185
Well, what are you gettin' at?

509
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:57,257
That I shot him twice
with buckshot!

510
00:35:57,357 --> 00:36:00,862
He should be dead,
but he didn't spend one night

511
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:01,863
in the hospital.

512
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:04,231
Well, if you're trying
to tell me something,

513
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:06,266
just say it!

514
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,670
Vicki Newton,
it's a real possibility

515
00:36:08,703 --> 00:36:12,406
that this Jack Harding
isn't a man at all.

516
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,512
And the state of Alabama
knew that

517
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,847
all the way back in '68.

518
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:27,254
I-- I can't believe that.

519
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,824
Well, believe it,
Vicki Newton,

520
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,693
'cause it's true.

521
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:34,595
Well, that sure
wasn't much of a skinny dip.

522
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:35,495
I'm tired.

523
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,898
You're always tired.

524
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,733
You're even tired
when I do this.

525
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,267
Stop it!

526
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,235
What's the matter with you?

527
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,238
I'm not some young stallion,
you know?

528
00:36:45,272 --> 00:36:48,509
If you require a--
a War Admiral, my dear,

529
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,377
or a Seabiscuit,
then I advise you

530
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,513
to head on down
to the nearest waterin' hole.

531
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,448
Well, you know,
I love an old horse

532
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,883
put out the pasture.

533
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,019
Oh, stop it.

534
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:01,288
Come on, Deets, my sweet,
let's go take a nap.

535
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:04,726
Now, you're speaking
my language, my dear!

536
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:07,294
<i>And then</i>
<i>I'll read your horoscope</i>

537
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:08,495
<i>for the next three days.</i>

538
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,832
<i>Or we could go to</i>
<i>a Chinese restaurant</i>

539
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,499
- <i>and get some of the--</i>
- <i>Fortune cookies!</i>

540
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,902
<i>Fortune cookies, yeah.</i>

541
00:37:14,936 --> 00:37:16,436
<i>I-- I love the fortune</i>
<i>cookies, but you--</i>

542
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,438
<i>It's all a bunch of bunk.</i>

543
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:21,308
Honey, let me tell you
what the world is all about.

544
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,443
I don't know.
Don't talk about it anymore.

545
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,981
So, nap,
and then fortune cookies

546
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:27,982
and Ouija boards?

547
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:31,351
Well, as long as the nap
is included in that list

548
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,153
and at the top,

549
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:34,454
I'll do whatever you want,
my dear.

550
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:40,027
Come on, my love, it's nap time!

551
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:41,629
Just a minute.

552
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,314
How's your pie?

553
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:02,349
Good.

554
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,724
Oh, guys,
I think I'm gonna ask her out.

555
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:11,959
- We know.
- Of course you are.

556
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,027
And here's your change.

557
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,328
Uh, no keep it. Keep it.

558
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:18,065
Uh, say, what are you doing
later tonight?

559
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,368
Uh, just watchin' the game
with my daddy.

560
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,004
Oh, how nice.

561
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:25,338
Yeah, we watch this one
and the Birmingham Bowl together

562
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:26,007
every year.

563
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,508
- It's good luck.
- Oh.

564
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:28,709
Well, say, that's too bad.

565
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:30,912
Uh, I was gonna invite you over
to my Uncle Deeter's place

566
00:38:30,945 --> 00:38:33,548

567

Yeah.

Hi, I'm Vicki.

Vicki. Vicki.
Nice to meet you, Vicki.

615
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,811
Yeah, that's a sweet name there.
I tell you what?

616
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,612
It's not every day
you see such a pretty lady

617
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:20,014
drivin' such a pretty car.

618
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,817
Well, I reckon
that's 'cause it ain't my car.

619
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,185
- It's not, eh?
- It's my friend's.

620
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,686
Is it? Your friend?
You got a friend?

621
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,754
Yeah?

622
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:29,223

623
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,958
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

was just complimentin' your car.

Oh, yeah?

00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:36,797
Yeah.

627
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:38,165
Ah. Ricky Dean Logan.

628
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,667
I ain't shakin' your hand,
man.

629
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,936
You don't know where you are,
do you?

630
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,172
Just outside Cullman, I guess.

631
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:46,774
Yeah, well,
that's exactly right.

632
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:48,209
Meanin' you got
one hell of a nerve

633
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,677
showin' up here, son.

634
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,046
We don't tolerate
your kind here.

635
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:54,315
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

636
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,818
My kind.
And what kind is that?

637
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,653
I'll tell you
exactly what kind.

638
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:02,890
Hold up. Hold up. Wait.

639
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:12,700
Kinda soothes your soul
a little bit.

640
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,968
You know what?

641
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,737
I just figured out what it was
while I was drinkin' my drink.

642
00:42:16,771 --> 00:42:19,073
It-- it-- it was this
Church of Christ bumper sticker,

643
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,174
wasn't it?

644
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,208
I see it.

645
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,044
Now, you know,
you folk in Cullman

646
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:25,246
don't like Church of Christ.
That's it!

647
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,947
The whole side
of my daddy's family

648
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,582
is Church of Christ,
I'll have you know.

649
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,918
No, that ain't it!
We allow them!

650
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,119
I know what it is.

651
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,722
It's the Alabama-Mobile
bumper sticker

652
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,957
and you are a Tennessee A&M fan.

653
00:42:36,991 --> 00:42:40,761
Tennessee A&M? Hell no!
Look at-- look at my hat!

654
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:42,730
I'm the biggest
Seahawk supporter around here.

655
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:43,898
You can ask anybody.

656
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:46,867
Then sir,
I'm strugglin' hard to find out

657
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:50,371
what it could possibly be
that you don't like about me,

658
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,139
considering we just
laid eyes on each other

659
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:53,274
for the first time.

660
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:55,876
I'll tell you exactly
what it is that I don't like.

661
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,011
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

662
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,279
I know what it is.

663
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,715
You think that Trent Thompson
should be first string tailback

664
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:04,685
at AMU over my son Lucky Henry.

665
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,687
Lucky Henry is your son?

666
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,889
Oh, I-- I didn't know
Lucky Henry was your boy.

667
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:09,857
That-- Luck--

668
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,792
Lucky Henry is
one of my favorite athletes!

669
00:43:11,826 --> 00:43:13,294
Well!

670
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:15,863
Then what could it
possibly be about me

671
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,698
that you don't like, mister?

672
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:20,367
Uh, it uh, I-- I--
I guess I just mistook you

673
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:21,702
for somebody else.

674
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:23,304
Alright, then.

675
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:26,807
It was good chatting with you,
but we gotta hit the road

676
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:29,743
if we're gonna make it down
to Mobile before kickoff.

677
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,287
You know what that man
was tryin' to do

678
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:42,323
when he started talkin' to me,
right?

679
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:45,893
Yeah.

680
00:43:45,926 --> 00:43:48,929
Complimentin' this
damn fine automobile.

681
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:52,399
No. He was complimentin' me.

682
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:55,669
Which in theory, there ain't
nothing wrong with that.

683
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,406
And I know it ain't the same,

684
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:01,842
but he would've acted
just as ugly to me

685
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:04,311
if I hadn't acted kindly
to his advances.

686
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:06,747
Newsflash, Vicki Newton.

687
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,316
If you had been a black lady,

688
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:12,953
he would've tried to run
your ass straight out of town

689
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:14,855
and not back to his bedroom.

690
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:17,992
I know it ain't the same.

691
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,930
Still ain't no fun
havin' men prey on you

692
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,399
like you're some sort of object
and then just discard you

693
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:28,002
when you're not interested in
what they're after.

694
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:32,973
Hell, since I know
where you kept your gun,

695
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:35,009
I-- I -- I had mind
to just whip it out

696
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,144
and point it
at that son-of-a-bitch.

697
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:40,981
I-- I-- I might've
accidentally shot the fucker

698
00:44:41,015 --> 00:44:43,117
and when the cops came in,
I would just say,

699
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,221
"Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just a dumb old woman.

700
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:50,257
I didn't know
how to use the thing."

701
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:57,765
Hey, I've done been
to one execution.

702
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:59,833
I can't take yours, too!

703
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,276
Y'all, I'm gonna need me a nap

704
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,111
if I'm gonna be
worth a darn tonight.

705
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:47,948
Oh, yeah,
I could go for a nap.

706
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:51,485
He only has eyes
for Bronco Burger waitresses.

707
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:55,122
Well, I don't
wanna sleep with you.

708
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:59,093
Just nap.
There is a big dang difference.

709
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:00,461
Okay. It's okay.

710
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:03,063
I could nap.

711
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:05,399
Well, come on in, Neddy Teddy.

712
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,268
I'll nap with you any old day.

713
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:11,205
Denver, nap time.

714
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,908
Nap time. Nap time.

715
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:17,945
Nap time. Nap time. Nap time.

716
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:20,114
Well, I ain't even tired!

717
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:23,250
Denver, babe, my nose hurts
just lookin' at you.

718
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:26,920
You know, sleep
is just as important as water,

719
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,455
which I haven't
seen you drink at all

720
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:29,490
since we've been here.

721
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,091
All I'm sayin' is
that maybe you might need--

722
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:34,395
Meow, meow, meow.

723
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:38,265
Meow, meow, meow. Meow.

724
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,303
Meow, meow, meow.

725
00:46:42,737 --> 00:46:47,074
Meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow...

726
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,175
What the fuck?

727
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,311
Meow.

728
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:52,046
Alright, nap time.

729
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:56,618
Meow, meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow, meow.

730
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,953
Meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow.

731
00:47:00,689 --> 00:47:07,127
Meow, meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,

732
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:10,297
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,

733
00:47:10,331 --> 00:47:13,000
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,
meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

734
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:16,136
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

735
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,616
Pretty good.

736
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,117
I knew you'd like this place.

737
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,885
- Yeah.
- Glad we came.

738
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:51,071
Um, excuse me,
I'm lookin' for the sheriff.

739
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,439
He's right over there.

740
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:01,549
Sheriff?

741
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:03,984
Well, I reckon
you could say that.

742
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:07,488
I've been called much worse.
Sheriff Toliver Shanks.

743
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:11,158
Ricky Dean Logan.
This here is Vicki Newton.

744
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:14,529
What can I do
for you folks today?

745
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,930
Well, we're gonna need
to sit down for this one.

746
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,298
Oh, please.

747
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:27,941
I see you uh,
heard about the execution?

748
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:29,611
Yep, read all about it.

749
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:32,012
Uh, said it went off
without a hitch.

750
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:35,550
Said the Yellow Mama
took Harding out of this world.

751
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,050
I'm sorry,
but we have some really

752
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,452
disheartenin' news to tell you.

753
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:40,487
Well, howdy, y'all,
welcome to Bronco Burger.

754
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:42,322
My name's Heather
and I'll be your cowpoke today.

755
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:44,358
Our house special includes
the Buckin' Bronc' combo

756
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:46,326
with Bronco Soda
and Stallion Fries.

757
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,161
If that don't interest you,

758
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:49,096
I can get you
some menus out here.

759
00:48:49,496 --> 00:48:50,964
I am starvin'.

760
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:56,103
Well, well um, get us
two of the house specials.

761
00:48:56,136 --> 00:48:57,404
And can you get us
some Coca Colas

762
00:48:57,438 --> 00:48:59,206
instead of whatever else
that was you said.

763
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:00,474
You got it. Comin' right up.

764
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:01,643
Can I get you anything else,
Sheriff?

765
00:49:01,676 --> 00:49:03,010
I'm good for now, hon.

766
00:49:03,043 --> 00:49:04,211
Alrighty.

767
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,080
Sheriff Shanks,

768
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,483
we were at that
execution last night.

769
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:12,319
And despite of what you
might be readin' in that paper,

770
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:15,022
that monster's
still walkin' this Earth.

771
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:18,358
And I believe he's
right here in Hackleburg.

772
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,528
Last night,
he got up out of his coffin,

773
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:24,298
and he killed three people,
and broke my goddamn hand.

774
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:27,468
It's true.
I saw it with my own two eyes.

775
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:28,736
He stole that hearse
that they were carryin'

776
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,305
his body in
and he took off in it.

777
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:32,607
Oh, man.

778
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:37,211
Y'all pullin' old
Sheriff Shanks' leg, aren't you?

779
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:40,715
Who put you up to this?
Sheriff Craven over in Sonoma?

780
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:43,651
Dammit, Sheriff!
This is the real deal!

781
00:49:43,685 --> 00:49:45,319
Two Coca Colas.

782
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:46,420
Thanks, hon.

783
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:50,758
Y'all seriously
expect me to believe

784
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:54,596
that old Jakkariah Harding
took a ride on the Yellow Mama,

785
00:49:54,629 --> 00:49:57,197
and then just
dusted hisself off,

786
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:59,801
and walked right out of
his own damn grave?

787
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:02,236
Don't call him by that name.

788
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,405
This isn't is a man,
Sheriff Shanks.

789
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,441
This is a monster!

790
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:12,279
Listen, if Dracula name
was Phillip Tankersley,

791
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:13,681
you wouldn't say,
"There goes Phillip,

792
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,415
drinkin' some blood."

793
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:18,085
Nobody's ever seen Wolfman
running at him and said,

794
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:21,321
"Oh, hey. there goes
old Larry Talbot."

795
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:24,091
Do you believe in
Wolfman and Dracula?

796
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:27,629
Ricky Dean,
just take a sip of soda.

797
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,632
Sheriff, look,
I know it sounds crazy.

798
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:32,399
And I-- I wouldn't have
believed it either.

799
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:34,301
But I did see it.

800
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:36,671
Ricky Dean is lucky to be alive.

801
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,774
What does it hurt
if you would just believe us?

802
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:43,611
I reckon it wouldn't do
no harm to contact my boys

803
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,813
and tell them
to keep their eyes

804
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:49,216
on the lookout
for old black hearse.

805
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,186
Good luck's on your side,
Ricky Dean Logan.

Here's the city limits.

846
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:18,839
And that's farmland
as far as the eye can see.

847
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:21,542
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'm out of here, y'all.</i>

848
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:22,977
Headed home?

849
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,111
Yes, sir.

850
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:26,647
All right.
Well, come over here.

851
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,916
You can't leave without this.
Here's your tip.

852
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,585
Ah. Thank you.

853
00:57:31,986 --> 00:57:34,255
I hope you figure out
whatever it is

854
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:35,790
you're working on.

855
00:57:36,257 --> 00:57:39,527
Listen, there may be
a bad man out in town tonight.

856
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,162
So if you see a black hearse
riding around,

857
00:57:41,195 --> 00:57:43,097
just steer clear.

858
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,632
- Hear me?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

859
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:47,068
That is one of my guiding
principles, anyway.

860
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,770
If I see your hearse coming,
I go in the other direction.

861
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,507
Well, you know what?

862
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,110
If you do that,
you'll be just fine.

863
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:57,845
And be safe, Heather.

864
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:59,914
- All right, y'all too.
- All right.

865
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,083
Now I'm gonna head out
to West Hackleburg,

866
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:03,284
make some rounds.

867
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:06,587
You all hit the east side
and then we'll meet back here

868
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,922
in a couple hours.

869
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:11,292
Now, if you need to get
in contact with me, call 911

870
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:14,028
and have 'em
patch through to my radio.

871
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,732
All right.
I appreciate that, Sheriff.

872
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:40,254
<i>For this evening's lead story,</i>
<i>Alabama officials are planning</i>

873
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:42,857
<i>to fast track more executions</i>

874
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:46,627
<i>after last night's successful</i>
<i>revival of the Yellow Mama.</i>

875
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:50,765
<i>But first, Gunnar Hansen has</i>
<i>more details about today's--</i>

876
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,600
Daddy, what are you doing?

877
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:54,635
Getting ready for Halloween.

878
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,004
Hey, you better go
get changed for the game.

879
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:59,173
Kickoff starts in
a little while.

880
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:03,244
Okay, daddy,
don't get upset with me,

881
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:06,280
but I kind of sort of made
other plans tonight.

882
00:59:06,313 --> 00:59:08,015
Other plans with who?

883
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:09,917
A boy named John Paul.

884
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:12,820
Oh. Right.

885
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,088
John Paul.

886
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:16,657
Do-- do I know John Paul?

887
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,659
Oh, I just met him
today at work.

888
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:19,693
You sure that's wise?

889
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:21,829
I mean, he--
he could be Ted Bundy. Right?

890
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,597
Daddy.

891
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:24,865
I'm just saying.

892
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:25,733
John Paul?

893
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:26,934
Well, he's real nice.

894
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:28,669
I think you'd like him.

895
00:59:28,702 --> 00:59:30,204
And it's just gonna
be a group thing.

896
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:32,173
We're just gonna watch the game
with him and his friends.

897
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,175
Are you-- are you asking?

898
00:59:35,743 --> 00:59:39,180
No, Daddy,
I'm-- I'm telling you.

899
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:42,750
Fair enough. All right.

900
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:46,954
Then it's me
and Mr. Bones today.

901
00:59:49,056 --> 00:59:51,926
I'm sure
he'll bring us good luck.

902
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,828
I'm sure he will, Daddy.

903
00:59:55,396 --> 00:59:56,997
Nothing over here.

904
00:59:57,898 --> 00:59:59,233
Anything on your side?

905
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,868
No.

906
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:04,105
But when I see something,
you'll be the first one to know,

907
01:00:04,138 --> 01:00:04,805
Vicki Newton.

908
01:00:05,406 --> 01:00:09,376
<i>...Alabama and Tennessee,</i>
<i>there is none bigger than this.</i>

909
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:13,013
<i>If you're from Alabama,</i>
<i>you're Mobile golden and green.</i>

910
01:00:14,682 --> 01:00:16,851
All right, boys, come on!

911
01:00:16,951 --> 01:00:17,985
Come on!

912
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:18,853
Let's see some action.

913
01:00:18,886 --> 01:00:20,988
I know, I need a win.

914
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:26,393
I would like to
introduce y'all

915
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:30,898
to Count War Damn Deeter!

916
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:38,339
I'm kidding, Bobbi Jo. I'm--

917
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:40,207
God, lighten up.

918
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,408
It's a game, come on.

919
01:00:41,442 --> 01:00:43,344
Oh, hey, that must be Heather.

920
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:44,945
Oh.

921
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:47,081
- How do I look?
- Groovy.

922
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:48,182
I look all right.

923
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:49,183
I dig it.

924
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,051
Shoes.

925
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:56,790
There's my boy, look.

926
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:57,892
Hey.

927
01:00:58,692 --> 01:01:00,161
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

928
01:01:00,194 --> 01:01:05,065
No, no.
I really liked your driveway.

929
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:07,868
Oh. Uh, thanks.

930
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:11,305
Uncle Deeter is thinking
about having it paved, so.

931
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,440
Oh, yeah. He should--
he should do that.

932
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:14,543
Yeah.

933
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:17,745
Uh, by the way, Uncle Deeter
is quite a character.

934
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:20,915
So, I just kinda wanna give you
a heads up on that.

935
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:24,018
Hey, everybody, this is Heather.

936
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,853
Heather, this is the gang.

937
01:01:26,954 --> 01:01:28,289
Hey, girl.

938
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,991
Come, sit down.

939
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:40,167
Milton Deeter, my dear.

940
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:42,002
Pleasure to meet you.

941
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:46,840
I'm Bobbi Jo,
Milton's girlfriend.

942
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:47,875
Yes.

943
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:49,343
And Bobbi Jo and I

944
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,146
are retiring to our room
for the evening.

945
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:54,782
Oh, no,
come on, Deets, hang out.

946
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,783
It's a party.

947
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:56,585
It's your house.

948
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,919
I guess we could sit
for a spell.

949
01:02:00,187 --> 01:02:02,289
Hey, kid, still got
any of that coke?

950
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:04,124
Sure do.

951
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:06,260
Right here.

952
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:08,062
Right answer
to the right question.

953
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:11,999
It's in this little box here.

954
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:18,472
Perfect. Perfect.

955
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:24,411
Ooh, yeah. Oh yeah.

956
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:28,516
I do not have any Pepsi
to offer you, my dear.

957
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,986
- But would you like some coke?
- Uh...

958
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:35,055
You ain't got to do anything
that you don't wanna, you hear?

959
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:41,195
Uh, reckon
I'll just hold off for now.

960
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:44,298
At least till I make sure y'all
aren't a bunch of Ted Bundys.

961
01:02:52,106 --> 01:02:54,041
Cute and wise.

962
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,409
Huh.

963
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:58,379
Shit, guys.

964
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,314
Where's Denver?

965
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:06,420
She's probably down
at the swimming hole.

966
01:03:08,055 --> 01:03:10,558
That's one complicated girl.

967
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:16,430
Still trying to wrap my mind
around the many interwoven

968
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,999
layers to which she possesses.

969
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:23,270
Well, you know, personally,
I think she's a damn idiot.

970
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:26,840
- Hey.
- But, hey, I like damn idiots.

971
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:27,941
Hey!

972
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:30,344
I'm a damn idiot.

973
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,079
Me too. Me too.

974
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:34,415
Well, I know that
Neddy Teddy, Pam the Glam.

975
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:35,482
You ain't got to tell me.

976
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:36,518
Meow!

977
01:03:36,551 --> 01:03:38,252
Meow! Meow! Meow!

978
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:41,255
Ugh, shit!
We're off and running.

979
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:42,456
Meow! Meow!

980
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,391
- Meow! Meow! Meow!
- Meow! Meow! Meow!

981
01:03:44,425 --> 01:03:45,359
- Meow! Meow!
- Meow! Meow!

982
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:48,563
- Meow! Meow! Meow!
- Meow! Meow! Meow!

983
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:49,430
Woof, woof, woof!

984
01:03:49,463 --> 01:03:51,198
Woof, woof, woof!

985
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:52,333
Bobbi Jo!

986
01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:53,901
What?

987
01:03:53,934 --> 01:03:55,069
Stop that.

988
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:57,004
You're embarrassing me.

989
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:00,407
I'm tired tonight, gang.

990
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,079
You need to get some shut eye?

991
01:04:05,112 --> 01:04:07,881
I can't get enough of it
these days, I swear.

992
01:04:13,387 --> 01:04:15,089
You see that cut?

993
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,925
Oh, yeah?

994
01:04:18,092 --> 01:04:19,093
What'd you do to yourself?

995
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:20,260
Nothing.

996
01:04:20,294 --> 01:04:24,365
When I woke up from my nap,
I was bleeding profusely.

997
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:26,934
Well, hell, Uncle Deeter.
You must have done something.

998
01:04:26,967 --> 01:04:28,168
Napping, my boy?

999
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:30,104
Merely napping.

1000
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:34,408
Unexplainable things
happen in this house.

1001
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:41,415
Unexplainable things to which
you will become accustomed

1002
01:04:41,448 --> 01:04:43,518
if you stay long enough.

1003
01:04:44,952 --> 01:04:46,453
Come, my lady.

1004
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:49,557
We will now retire to our room.

1005
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:52,359
Bye, Heather.

1006
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:54,662
War damn Seahawk!

1007
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:57,231
- War damn Seahawk!
- War damn Seahawk!

1008
01:04:58,165 --> 01:04:59,567
I think I wanna rouse Denver.

1009
01:04:59,601 --> 01:05:01,402
I'm getting worried.

1010
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,971
Man, she's fine.
She's a grown woman.

1011
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,339
Just watch the game.

1012
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:07,575
Uh, I don't know.

1013
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:10,043
I'm getting concerned.

1014
01:05:13,748 --> 01:05:15,015
Denver!

1015
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:17,284
<i>Come on, look,</i>
<i>go, go, go, go, go!</i>

1016
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:18,385
<i>Yes! Oh!</i>

1017
01:05:18,419 --> 01:05:20,187
- <i>Woah!</i>
- <i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

1018
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,989
<i>Best game we're playing.</i>

1019
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:24,391
Denver, you up there?

1020
01:05:31,533 --> 01:05:33,167
Denver.

1021
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:35,670
It's Neddy.

1022
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:37,572
Where are you?

1023
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,078
Denver?

1024
01:05:48,215 --> 01:05:49,684
Hello.

1025
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,696
Denver?

1026
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,439
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes!

1027
01:06:12,473 --> 01:06:13,373
Oh my gosh!

1028
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:14,642
I knew.
I told you!

1029
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:16,176
That's good, that's good.

1030
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:18,613
Oh, geez, Denver.

1031
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:22,517
Where are you?

1032
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:26,320
Denver, you down here?

1033
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:33,060
Surely you're not down here,
Denver.

1034
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:36,029
Denver. It's Neddy.

1035
01:06:41,435 --> 01:06:42,770
Hello?

1036
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:45,405
Denver?

1037
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:50,177
What the hell is that?

1038
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,518
John Paul.

1039
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:58,520
This house is haunted, man!

1040
01:06:58,553 --> 01:06:59,654
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:04,626
You got ghost.

1042
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:10,632
Chinese checker-playing ghost.

1043
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:14,434
Denver?

1044
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:24,646
Seahawks on the prowl tonight!

1045
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:26,614
Come on! Hey!

1046
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:40,795
At this rate,
it's gonna take a week

1047
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:42,530
to find that hearse.

1048
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:44,431
That's if he's even out there.

1049
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:48,068
I have no doubt
he's out there, Vicki Newton.

1050
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:49,169
We just haven't been looking

1051
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:51,204
in all the right places
just yet.

1052
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:53,473
But he'll show up.
I'm telling you.

1053
01:07:53,508 --> 01:07:55,275
Welcome to Bronco Burger.
I'm Amy.

1054
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:56,443
I'll be your cowpoke tonight.

1055
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:57,679
Um, we have a few specials.

1056
01:07:57,712 --> 01:07:59,212
Hey, just give us two
Coca-Colas, please.

1057
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:00,414
- Two?
- Oh, and hey,

1058
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:02,784
- where's the lady's room?
- Oh, just around the corner.

1059
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:21,501
Who wants a deluxe
Bronco Burger?

1060
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:23,103
- Me.
- Me.

1061
01:08:23,203 --> 01:08:25,305
Well, guess who's not
getting jack crap?

1062
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:27,341
Not at least till you tell me
the God's honest truth about

1063
01:08:27,374 --> 01:08:29,309
what really happened today.

1064
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:31,512
But mom, we've already
told you this story like,

1065
01:08:31,546 --> 01:08:33,681
50 bajillion times.

1066
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:37,484
Yeah. He looked like this.

1067
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:43,256
You told me the same lie
50 bajillion times.

1068
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,593
I don't want to hear any more
bullshit about a monster man

1069
01:08:45,627 --> 01:08:46,828
in a hearse.

1070
01:08:47,695 --> 01:08:50,263
I want to hear the real reason
you ended up at that hospital

1071
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:51,431
all damn day.

1072
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:54,802
- Ma'am, did you say hearse?
- Yes, I did.

1073
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:57,371
Ricky Dean,
get your ass over here.

1074
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:58,706
<i>Come on!</i>

1075
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,340
Come on! Come on!

1076
01:09:00,374 --> 01:09:02,577
Where are you? Stop him!
What are you doing?

1077
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,911
Get-- get there!

1078
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:06,480
What is going-- come on, y'all!
Come on!

1079
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:08,583
Why are we playing
like this today?

1080
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:10,317
C-- catch him!

1081
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:16,390
Uh, say,
you wanna take a little walk?

1082
01:09:16,423 --> 01:09:18,559
There's a nice little
path out back.

1083
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,494
I thought I was here
to watch the game.

1084
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:22,429
Oh, well, I mean, it's--

1085
01:09:22,462 --> 01:09:23,430
you know, it's pretty stressful.

1086
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:26,333
Maybe it we'd benefit
from stretching our legs

1087
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:28,569
a little bit
and getting some fresh air.

1088
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:31,271
Hmm. Maybe at half time.

1089
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:33,206
Yeah, half time.

1090
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:35,510
Oh, sack him!

1091
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:36,711
- What is this?
- Yes!

1092
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:37,945
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1093
01:09:39,681 --> 01:09:41,983
<i>We'll return to</i>

1100
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,268
Tell me, what do you make
of that man there?

1101
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:03,303
Hank or Hank's Good Stuff.

1102
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:04,505
I don't know.

1103
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,407
Seems like a real strong guy.

1104
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:08,776
Kind of sexy.

1105
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,713
Bobbi Jo, that man
does not care one iota

1106
01:10:11,746 --> 01:10:13,748
for the company of a woman.

1107
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:15,382
Really?

1108
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,118
- <i>We're cheap!</i>
- <i>We're cheap!</i>

1109
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:18,720
- <i>And we've been naughty!</i>
- And we've been naughty!

1110
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:20,755
<i>And garsh, so have I!</i>

1111
01:10:20,788 --> 01:10:22,857
Could've fooled me with
all those floozies around him.

1112
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,092
It's all a ruse.

1113
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:27,662
He desperately wants to appear
masculine in order to fit in

1114
01:10:27,695 --> 01:10:29,831
to the social structure
of Hackleburg.

1115
01:10:29,864 --> 01:10:31,866
Well, aren't you
the smartest thing?

1116
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:33,935
Kind of like when you told me
about those little boys

1117
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:36,369
wanting to diddle their mamas.

1118
01:10:36,838 --> 01:10:38,973
Oedipus complex.

1119
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:40,208
Go on.

1120
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,744
Yeah, you said the little boys
wanted to kill their daddies

1121
01:10:42,777 --> 01:10:44,779
and have their mamas
all to themselves.

1122
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,849
You do listen to me.

1123
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:49,751
Of course I do.

1124
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:52,754
That's how I know I got me
an Electra complex.

1125
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,022
That doesn't scare me at all.

1126
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:57,959
Cause I get to
live it out through you.

1127
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:02,262
Oh.

1128
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:05,933
You're not thinking about
jock straps anymore, are you?

1129
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:10,303
Maybe after the game
we turn the lights down.

1130
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:11,939
Watch a Fellini flick
or something?

1131
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:14,609
Yeah.

1132
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:18,713
That sounds great.

1133
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:20,515
Hold that thought

1134
01:11:20,548 --> 01:11:22,850
while I go slip on
something more comfortable.

1135
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:27,387
Happy third Saturday in October.

1136
01:11:50,945 --> 01:11:54,615

Baby!

1143
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:31,619
I think I need
your help in here.

1144
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:37,124
I seemed to have
misplaced my clothes.

1145
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,726
Well,
hold on one second, baby.

1146
01:12:38,759 --> 01:12:39,994
I'll be there soon.

1147

<i>Bobbi Jo, you get in here.</i>

1148
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:50,403
Now, baby.

1149
01:12:50,705 --> 01:12:52,439
I said I'll be there
in a minute.

1150
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:53,941
Be patient.

1151
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:59,013
Baby,

1152
01:13:01,749 --> 01:13:03,751
you better hurry.

1153
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:06,486
The time is nigh.

1154
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:09,023
Bobby Jo.

1155
01:13:17,932 --> 01:13:19,867
You need to
calm down in there.

1156
01:13:19,901 --> 01:13:22,069
Don't finish before
I get in there.

1157
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,951
I hope you're ready for me.

1158
01:13:38,886 --> 01:13:40,688
What are you doing in here?

1159
01:13:45,226 --> 01:13:48,129
My butt shaking
like I said it would, babe.

1160
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:51,065
You're not even
gonna look at me?

1161
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:54,869
Okay. Well, I guess you're
playing hard to get.

1162
01:13:57,071 --> 01:13:59,040
Just how hard are you?

1163
01:14:02,243 --> 01:14:04,612
Just like I like it.

1164
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:08,783
Oh my God!

1165
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:15,589

01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:21,629

1171
01:14:23,631 --> 01:14:25,132

<i>the boys are playing like</i>

1172
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,902

<i>get our asses handed to us.</i>

1175
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:32,940
Mm.
He's right.

1176
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:36,143
They're gonna get killed
if they keep playing like this.

1177
01:14:36,377 --> 01:14:38,579
It's 'cause I'm not watching
the game with my daddy.

1178
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:40,614
It's bad luck if we don't
watch it together.

1179
01:14:40,648 --> 01:14:41,849
John Paul,
you better tell your friend

1180
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:43,617
to take her ass home.

1181
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:46,020
I cannot take the loss
to A&M tonight.

1182
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,989
Hey, I'll go down there
and whoop Coach Redd myself

1183
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:49,256
if we get beat.

1184
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:52,560
Perfect time for a walk, I say.

1185
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:53,995
All right.

1186
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:56,030
Walk never hurt nobody,
I reckon.

1187
01:14:56,063 --> 01:14:59,066
- Hmm.
- Man, this party is a drag.

1188
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,068
Where the hell is everybody?

1189
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:03,704
You don't think
Denver and Ned.

1190
01:15:03,738 --> 01:15:06,540
Dancing Denver
and Neddy the teddy?

1191
01:15:06,574 --> 01:15:07,508
Hey, I don't know.

1192
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:09,310
They're both pretty far out.
I'm just saying.

1193
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:11,178
Mmm. No. Yep. Right.
Meow! Meow! Meow!

1194
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:12,179
Meow, meow!

01:15:12,213 --> 01:15:13,948
Meow, meow, meow!

1196
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:15,916
- Meow.
- Meow, meow, meow!

1197
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:17,184
We'll be back.

1198
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:18,185
All right.

1199
01:15:18,986 --> 01:15:20,187
Don't get lost.

1200
01:15:21,922 --> 01:15:23,557
I got that--

1201
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:27,194
Mm. Dancing Denver
and Neddy the teddy.

1202
01:15:27,661 --> 01:15:30,297
Ugh.
Maybe in his wildest dreams.

1203
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:41,842
How close are we,
Vicki Newton?

1204
01:15:42,009 --> 01:15:44,645
It looks like we still
have a good 10 miles to go.

1205
01:15:44,678 --> 01:15:46,814
Ten miles? Damn!

1206
01:15:47,314 --> 01:15:48,349
We should have called
Sheriff Shanks

1207
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:49,717
before we drove on out of there.

1208
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,651
No.

1209
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:52,753
Everything we need
to handle that monster

1210
01:15:52,787 --> 01:15:54,622
is in the trunk of this car.

1211
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,791
When I get him on the ground,
you just be ready

1212
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:58,325
with what's in the trunk.

1213
01:15:58,726 --> 01:15:59,760
Can't stay out here too long.

1214
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:02,263
I want to finish watching
that football game.

1215
01:16:02,296 --> 01:16:05,132
No, we're just gonna
stretch our legs a little bit.

1216
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,370
So you didn't uh,
grow up here?

1217
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:11,906
No, but I spent
a lot of time here.

1218
01:16:12,006 --> 01:16:14,809
You know, I'm sure shocked
that we ain't never met before.

1219
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:18,779
Well, I'm sure glad you walked
into my Bronco Burger today.

1220
01:16:18,813 --> 01:16:20,714
Yeah, I am, too.

1221
01:16:20,748 --> 01:16:23,951
You know, I think there was
something in those Bronco sodas.

1222
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:31,358
Well, yeah.

1223
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:32,927
I mean, I really liked
their odds this year.

1224
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,195
I mean, I think they're
gonna repeat.

1225
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:37,031
Yeah, but their defense isn't
as great as it was last year.

1226
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:38,999
Well, yeah.

1227
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:41,869
Hey, John Paul.

1228
01:16:42,103 --> 01:16:43,370
What's that?

1229
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:47,208
Dang.
Where did that come from?

1230
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:49,176
It's a hearse.

1231
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,277
Well, I know that.

1232
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:52,313
I just don't know
where it came from.

1233
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,148
It's not y'alls?

1234
01:16:54,315 --> 01:16:56,684
I've never seen it
before in my life.

1235
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,121
I was warned today
about a hearse.

1236
01:17:00,154 --> 01:17:03,124
I was told if I saw one,
I should steer clear of it.

1237
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:05,960
What, you're superstitious?

1238
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:13,134
I left my keys inside.

1239
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:16,303
I thi-- I think I ought
to grab them and go.

1240
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:18,973
Hey, listen, I'll ask the gang
if they know about it.

1241
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:21,008
Uh, we'll figure this out.

1242
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:27,448
These folks, they--

1243
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:29,083
they came into
Bronco Burger today.

1244
01:17:29,116 --> 01:17:30,417
They're the ones that warned me.

1245
01:17:30,451 --> 01:17:32,353
They-- they were
talking about that--

1246
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:35,356
that killer that got executed.
Jakkariah Harding.

1247
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,191
Yeah, he's dead.

1248
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:39,360
You think he's got something
to do with this hearse?

1249
01:17:39,393 --> 01:17:41,428
<i>And broke my goddamn hand.</i>

1250
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:43,264
What did he say before that?

1251
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:47,001
Huh?

1252
01:17:48,235 --> 01:17:49,904
Hey, hey, hold on.

1253
01:17:50,738 --> 01:17:53,841
Hey, can you just explain
to me what's going on?

1254
01:17:57,144 --> 01:17:58,812
Why are all the lights off?

1255
01:17:59,313 --> 01:18:01,248
Oh, there ain't no tellin'.

1256
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:05,386
Well, hey, it's probably just
a fuse or something.

1257
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,254
We'll get in here
and switch that fuse out.

1258
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,089
We'll be watching the game
in no time, all right?

1259
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:10,925
Nothing to worry about.

1260
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:14,929
What?

1261
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:18,432
Hey, they're probably just
goofing off in here

1262
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:19,967
or something.

1263
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:29,710
Oh, they're just joking.

1264
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:31,812
Hey, why y'all sitting
in the dark?

1265
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:34,348
Seriously,
what's going on, y'all?

1266
01:18:34,549 --> 01:18:36,283
John Paul,
get away from there!

1267
01:18:36,585 --> 01:18:37,818
Joke's over.

1268
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:39,286
Wake up, everybody.

1269
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,722
Hey, everybody, wake up. Hey!

1270
01:19:10,351 --> 01:19:13,153
Hey, monster, remember me?

1271
01:19:20,094 --> 01:19:23,130
Vicki Newton, Vicki Newton
get your ass in here.

1272
01:19:25,065 --> 01:19:26,367
Oh my God.

1273
01:19:30,371 --> 01:19:32,373
Ah, oh my God.

1274
01:19:34,341 --> 01:19:37,077
Heather?
Bronco Burger Heather?

1275
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:39,246
Hey, hey, hey,
Vicki Newton here.

1276
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,180
Vicki Newton here.

1277
01:19:40,214 --> 01:19:41,549
Everything is gonna be okay.

1278
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:42,883
All right, hon?

1279
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:43,984
Nightmare is over.

1280
01:19:44,018 --> 01:19:45,520
It's over! It's over.

1281
01:19:45,553 --> 01:19:47,021
The nightmare is over.

1282
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:49,290
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1283
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:54,428
It's all right.
It's all right.

1284
01:20:27,161 --> 01:20:30,331
Hey, hey, it's all right.

1285
01:20:30,364 --> 01:20:31,899
Come on. Sit down.

1286
01:20:32,299 --> 01:20:33,467
Come on.

1287
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,270
It's all right.

1288
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:45,279
This is what you deserve,
motherfucker!

1289
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,281
It's a goddamn nightmare
in there.

1290
01:21:23,183 --> 01:21:25,152
Come on back here, Ricky Dean.

1291
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:49,343
I wanna go home.

1292
01:21:52,514 --> 01:21:54,549
I wanna see my daddy.

1293
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:56,083
No, no, hon.

1294
01:21:56,116 --> 01:21:56,984
You need to stay here.

1295
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:59,219
The cops are gonna
want to talk to you.

1296
01:22:01,523 --> 01:22:03,090
Tomorrow.

1297
01:22:03,223 --> 01:22:04,526
Let her go home.

1298
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:06,293
To be with her daddy.

1299
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,062
She's one of the lucky ones.

1300
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,710
Hey, hey, come on.

1301
01:22:23,645 --> 01:22:26,213
You're all right?
We're together now come on.

1302
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:28,015
It's all right.

1303
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:49,336
It's been a long night.

1304
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:55,008
But at least we did
one thing that's right.

1305
01:22:56,276 --> 01:23:00,715
Hey, you did what you
came here to do.

1306
01:23:01,415 --> 01:23:03,083
You got him.

1307
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:05,520
After all this time,
you got him.

1308
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:08,723
I'm gonna go call the law.

1309
01:23:16,598 --> 01:23:20,267
♪ <i>Ooh, shopping at night ♪</i>

1310
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,036

<i>Hank's Good Stuff...</i>

1312
01:23:28,576 --> 01:23:30,444
Ricky Dean!

1313
01:23:44,692 --> 01:23:46,093
He's in the damn car!

1314
01:23:46,126 --> 01:23:46,794
How do you know?

1315
01:23:46,828 --> 01:23:48,128
I just know it, Vicki Newton!

1316
01:23:48,161 --> 01:23:50,264
I know it!
I can feel it!

1317
01:23:50,297 --> 01:23:52,065
Then she's dead already.

1318
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:53,066
No.

1319
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,570
He's just using her to get away.

1320
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:59,206
He's going where she's going
and then he's gonna kill her,

1321
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:01,509
so he could throw it
in my damn face.

1322
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,343
- Think, um...
- Think, think.

1323
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:04,512
How can we find her?

1324
01:24:04,546 --> 01:24:05,747
- You remember her name?
- Heather.

1325
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,115
But I don't know her last name.

1326
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,417
- But--
- Come on, come on!

1327
01:24:10,450 --> 01:24:12,119
She works at
the Bronco Burger.

1328
01:24:12,152 --> 01:24:13,253
That's it, that's it.

1329
01:24:17,559 --> 01:24:18,760
You're welcome so much.

1330
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:26,266
Bronco Burger.
This is Amy.

1331
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,268
This is gonna be
a very weird conversation.

1332
01:24:28,302 --> 01:24:30,103
But I just need you
to go with it

1333
01:24:30,137 --> 01:24:32,439
- and not ask any questions.
- Okay.

1334
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:35,475
You know the girl who works
the day shift, Heather?

1335
01:24:36,109 --> 01:24:37,712
<i>Yeah, you're talking</i>
<i>about Heather Hill.</i>

1336
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:39,814
Hill? Okay, good. Good.

1337
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:41,448
Uh, where does
Heather Hill live?

1338
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:43,051
Um, I'm not sure

1339
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:44,786
I'm supposed to be giving out
that kind of information.

1340
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:46,621
If you don't tell me
where Heather Hill lives,

1341
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:48,322
she's as good as dead.

1342
01:24:50,592 --> 01:24:51,826
Um, excuse me,

1343
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:54,261
who here knows where
Heather Hill lives?

1344
01:24:54,294 --> 01:24:56,129
Who wants to know?

1345
01:24:57,732 --> 01:24:59,266
Anybody?

1346
01:25:01,536 --> 01:25:02,570
I'm sorry, lady.

1347
01:25:02,604 --> 01:25:04,338
<i>Nobody here knows</i>
<i>where Heather Hill lives.</i>

1348
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,441
Damn it.

1349
01:25:07,474 --> 01:25:09,343
Nobody knows where she lives.

1350
01:25:14,414 --> 01:25:16,751
Okay, I got an idea.

1351
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,687
Call Bronco Burger back,
Vicki Newton.

1352
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:21,421
Call 'em back!

1353
01:25:29,931 --> 01:25:31,498
Bronco Burger.

1354
01:25:32,066 --> 01:25:34,569
Yes, um, I'm doing
a follow-up question

1355
01:25:34,602 --> 01:25:35,770
on Heather Hill.

1356
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:37,572
Hey, is this
some kind of a joke?

1357
01:25:37,605 --> 01:25:40,575
Listen, I just need you
to ask everyone there.

1358
01:25:40,608 --> 01:25:43,310
Does anyone know who
Heather Hill's daddy is?

1359
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:48,650
Y'all know who
Heather Hill's daddy is?

1360
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,654
You're talking about
old Barry Hill.

1361
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:55,723
Yeah, I know that
son-of-a-bitch, good old boy.

1362
01:25:56,724 --> 01:25:58,760
<i>His name is Barry Hill.</i>

1363
01:25:59,827 --> 01:26:02,664
Look in that damn phone book
and find Barry Hill.

1364
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:14,609
Daddy?

1365
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:19,580
Daddy?

1366
01:26:19,947 --> 01:26:20,882
<i>And you're right, partner,</i>

1367
01:26:20,915 --> 01:26:22,650
<i>this is the moment of truth.</i>

1368
01:26:22,684 --> 01:26:24,585
<i>They can take their</i>
<i>first lead of the night</i>

1369
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:26,453
<i>With a touchdown on this drive,</i>

1370
01:26:26,486 --> 01:26:27,989
<i>but if you're gonna</i>
<i>make it happen,</i>

1371
01:26:28,022 --> 01:26:29,624
<i>you better do it now.</i>

1372
01:26:31,258 --> 01:26:33,895
<i>If he's gonna take the ball</i>
<i>himself on a QB keeper,</i>

1373

01:26:37,965 --> 01:26:39,834

1376
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:43,236
<i>Gotta give all credit...</i>

1377
01:26:45,673 --> 01:26:48,576
<i>Patrick pitches to Lucky Henry</i>
<i>and here he goes.</i>

1378
01:26:48,609 --> 01:26:51,445
<i>Oh! What a move to</i>

1379
01:26:51,546 --> 01:26:53,648
<i>Here goes Lucky</i>
<i>breaking away now</i>

1380
01:26:53,681 --> 01:26:56,884

1381
01:26:56,918 --> 01:26:59,921
Listen to this
crowd come to life.

1382
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:13,300
- War damn Seahawk.
- War damn Seahawk.

1383
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:14,802
Oh, come on now.

1384
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:16,938
- Hey, old timer.
- Howdy, Barry.

1385
01:27:17,471 --> 01:27:19,339
Hey, you know uh, Bethany?

1386
01:27:19,372 --> 01:27:20,675
Oh, Bethany, nice to meet you.

1387
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:22,275
Nice to meet you, too.
Thank you.

1388
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:23,811
Got quite a game going on,
don't we?

1389
01:27:23,845 --> 01:27:24,879
Oh, you tell me.

1390
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:26,814
Whew!

1391
01:27:26,848 --> 01:27:29,851
You know, you mighty popular
around here tonight.

1392
01:27:29,951 --> 01:27:30,852
How's that?

1393
01:27:30,885 --> 01:27:33,054
Somebody called up here
asking about you.

1394
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:34,589
And your daughter.

1395
01:27:34,622 --> 01:27:35,857
Do what now?

1396
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,024
Yeah, some folks
called up here saying

1397
01:27:37,058 --> 01:27:39,026
Heather Hill was
as good as dead.

1398
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:40,494
I don't know.

1399
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:41,863
I couldn't make any sense of it.

1400
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:43,396
They say who they were?

1401
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,332
I didn't get any names.

1402
01:27:46,734 --> 01:27:51,438
Look, order something,
anything you want now.

1403
01:27:51,471 --> 01:27:52,540
I'll be right back.

1404
01:27:52,573 --> 01:27:55,442
- Where are you going?
- I gotta check on my daughter.

1405
01:27:56,077 --> 01:27:57,444
Good luck, Barry.

1406
01:28:09,757 --> 01:28:10,892
Yeah.

1407
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:13,728
I'm real lucky.

1408
01:29:13,888 --> 01:29:14,989
Heather Hill!

1409
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:16,057
Yes?

1410
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:17,792
Ricky Dean Logan here.

1411
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,661
<i>I don't need you to</i>
<i>ask me any questions.</i>

1412
01:29:20,695 --> 01:29:23,631
<i>I just need you to do</i>
<i>what I fucking tell you to do,</i>

1413
01:29:23,664 --> 01:29:25,398
- <i>okay, sweetheart?</i>
- Okay.

1414
01:29:25,432 --> 01:29:28,035
Get your ass
out the goddamn house now!

1415
01:29:58,099 --> 01:30:00,034
No! No.

1416
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:06,540
<i>No! No! No, no!</i>

1417
01:30:06,874 --> 01:30:10,544
No! No! No!

1418
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,583
No! No! No, no!

1419
01:30:16,584 --> 01:30:17,818
Heather?

1420
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:22,757
Meet my daddy, motherfucker!

1421
01:30:25,593 --> 01:30:26,727
Son of a bitch!

1422
01:30:27,728 --> 01:30:29,096
Son of a bitch!

1423
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,898
Heather, the gun case!

1424
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:32,600
I don't know the combination.

1425
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:35,770
15-48-91!

1426
01:30:39,807 --> 01:30:41,474
Ugh, damn!

1427
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,892
Okay, okay.

1428
01:31:01,095 --> 01:31:03,496
Son of a bitch.

1429
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:06,867
Daddy!

1430
01:31:11,806 --> 01:31:13,874
Get up! Get up!

1431
01:31:15,743 --> 01:31:18,045
Get out of my house!

1432
01:31:19,113 --> 01:31:20,614
Stay behind me, sweetie.

1433
01:31:21,816 --> 01:31:23,751
You're just gonna have
to trust me, Daddy.

1434
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:25,720
Shoot him!

1435
01:31:26,287 --> 01:31:27,822
I trust you, honey!

1436
01:31:29,256 --> 01:31:30,224
Shoot him!

1437
01:31:32,293 --> 01:31:33,594
Shoot him again!

1438
01:31:34,562 --> 01:31:35,896
What the hell?

1439
01:31:39,734 --> 01:31:41,235
Get out of the house.

1440
01:31:56,751 --> 01:31:58,619
I know you think
he's dead, Daddy,

1441
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:00,554
but you gotta watch him.

1442
01:32:18,973 --> 01:32:20,141
Barry!

1443
01:32:20,274 --> 01:32:21,175
Where the hell is he?

1444
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:23,911
He's in there on the floor
and he's dead.

1445
01:32:27,281 --> 01:32:28,215
Thank God!

1446
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:29,350
Oh God!

1447
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:30,851
You're okay.

1448
01:32:32,186 --> 01:32:35,122
Heather, what happened?

1449
01:32:35,956 --> 01:32:37,191
My daddy.

1450
01:32:38,726 --> 01:32:40,061
He saved me.

1451
01:32:42,863 --> 01:32:43,998
Of course.

1452
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:47,902
That's what daddies are for.

1453
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:55,576
Hey,
that son-of-a-bitch is gone.

1454
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,878
I mean, virtually vanished.

1455
01:33:00,314 --> 01:33:01,816
Don't be concerned though.

1456
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:04,752
He can't get too far.

1457
01:33:05,686 --> 01:33:07,154
I'm on his trail.

1458
01:33:11,725 --> 01:33:13,594
I want y'all to meet my daddy.

1459
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:15,262
Hey, Daddy.

1460
01:33:17,064 --> 01:33:19,667
These are the people
that helped saved me tonight.

1461
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:23,170
Barry Hill.
Pleasure to meet you.

1462
01:33:23,204 --> 01:33:25,206
Ricky Dean Logan, sir.

1463
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:27,775
And that's my friend,
Vicki Newton.

1464
01:33:27,808 --> 01:33:28,876
Barry.

1465
01:33:28,909 --> 01:33:30,211
Ms. Newton.

1466
01:33:30,377 --> 01:33:33,614
I want to thank y'all for
looking out for my little girl.

1467
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:35,349
Yeah.

1468
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:37,785
You got something
special there, sir.

1469
01:33:37,818 --> 01:33:39,120
I think so.

1470
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:42,423
Did I hear him say that that
man in there got up and left?

1471
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:44,158
How is that possible?

1472
01:33:44,191 --> 01:33:45,926
He isn't a man.

1473
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,361
He's a monster.

1474
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:52,399
Mr. Hill,
I got a story to tell you,

1475
01:33:52,433 --> 01:33:54,268
if you got time to listen.

1476
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:55,870
It's been a long night.

1477
01:33:55,903 --> 01:33:57,037
I wish somebody would tell me

1478
01:33:57,071 --> 01:33:59,140
what the hell
is going on around here.
