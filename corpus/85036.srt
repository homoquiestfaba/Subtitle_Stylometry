Why are there no fires?

70
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,471

00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,404
and pull the boat at it.

77
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,216

78
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,786
Row for the boat...

79
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,188

81
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,276
She's going to sink!

82
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,767
We need to get some more come around in.

83
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,781
She's getting on us!

84
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,158
Pull! Pull!

85
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,574
Go for that..

86
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,094
Quiet! No shouts,no calls.

87
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,998
False trot

88
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,888
lt's been six inches,sir.

89
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,598
Holding.

Good work.

Thank you.sir.

92
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,379
So,what's the...

93
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,245
Just some break ups,sir.

00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,911
Well,indeed you're a good hands.

95
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,684
l'll do anything l can,
l know you're the kids father.

96
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,618
His father will understood that he's a lad.

97
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,064
His mother however..

98
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,827
Let me take a look at that...

99
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,637
Damn it was good,it came out of nowhere.

100
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,172
...cut through of our tail,to get our...

101
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,627
l have no idea what precisely
what you're talking about here.

102
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
but to come out of the wild.

103
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,671
suddenly sailing.

104
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,072
and it happens in darkness,
on our exact positions.

105
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,371
well,...

106
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:22,905

107
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:24,749
lndeed.

108
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,118
He knew we are looking for it,...

109
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,522
What if it's looking for us?

110
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,590
...i tell you she is frigid tonight

111
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,057
it was unlike a fair match.

112
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,217
it was no...

113
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:08,920
she was more like a...

114
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,231
you have to wonder of the nature of howl.

115
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,732
i'll tell you how they penetrate.

116
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,402
...two hundred yard,and i've don't
have guns of...

117
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,803
you must have the whether gage and a
clear advantage and fire cart.

118
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,537
What is the whether gage?

119
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,476
l'll show you against the...

120
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,909
not on the cloth.

121
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,885
...control of the engagement.

122
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,055
and loaded with guns and...

123
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,148
the simple fact is,we're soundly being.

124
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,495
having treated like that in the Pacific

125
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,460
treated the bounce of the opponents favor.

126
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,369
that can pass us in surprises is
someone that aged man of war.

127
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,935
Am l not correct?

128
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,675
You call me an aged man of war,Doctor?

129
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,683
Sup rise are not whole.None cold whole.

130
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,819
She's a bluff bound, with lovely lines.

131
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,979
ls a fine sea bird

132
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,253
Whetherly, stiff and fast.

133
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,256
Very fast if she is well handled.

134
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,988
Oh,she's not all.

135
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,357
She's in her pride.

136
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,235
Well, we can fetch...

137
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,304
Afraid we..is abandon our spare.

138
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,407
This life is confident with the basic prepares,

139
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,541
We can get home as we are.

140
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,405
l'm not going home.

141
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,321
About to....

142
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,889
We need a port and the ...

143
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,890
can be still come looking for us.

144
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,323
We can defeat the sea.

145
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,022
Here.above the Shoals.

146
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,864
As you said,..

147
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,832
she's taking the war, as well as the seas.

148
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,400
and we are suppose to stop.

149
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,061
But,sir.

150
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,206
We've respect she's the fast
and heaviest ship.

151
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,730
she's one of the class.

152
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,502
She'll be have way to keep home by
the way we've repaired it on the way.

153
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,542
Well then,there's not a moment to loose.

154
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,371
ls it true about how they put the lost...

155
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,736
What came in?

156
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:40,501
...told me when you die,they stitch
you up in your...

157
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,940
just to make sure, you was asleep.

158
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,478
Not true, who knows?

159
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,922
Will you tell them?

160
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,411
lt's alright.

161
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,882
it's just the loneman's speaking.

162
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,610
there.

163
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,448
l've never seen a braver patient.

164
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,028
oh,darling.Never mind.

165
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,461
soon l'll fix those.

166
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,121
Come on,l want that way for now.

167
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,462
You have two minutes to start the four...

168
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,829
Nice work!

169
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,849
Mr.Gullaby.

170
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,476
There's something might interest you here.

171
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,149
Look!

172
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,055
the Captain cover.

173
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:03,922
but he was ...

174
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:04,856
when he was in your age.

175
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,756
but he was known as ship man ...

176
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,661
he says enough of his blood in the wood work

177
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,652
for the ship to almost be relation.

178
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,533
i do understand your part,Mr Gullaby.

179
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,534
You know that this is beyond question.

180
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,535
However,a week spent calling for
the Brazilian land force...

181
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,371
looking for a new mask

182
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,305
simply will not do.

183
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,329
...behalf of the..

184
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,140
...will do his best...

185
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,751
so it's his brains doctor.

186
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,819
no, that's just blood.

187
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,514
Those were his brains.

188
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,926
...and we have common surgeons.

Spoke to me on both occasions.

So,might we press you for a...

269
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,801
The first time that he spoke to me,

270

271
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,173

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,612
What was he trying to say exactly,

275
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,530
The second time,the second time

he see of a king and a country of a
captain warm.

279
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,114

for another man.

281
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:46,461

exception to the role of the authority corrupts.

lf you,were force to make a choice,will fill
us with no other responds.

291
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:42,417
lf you can push me,i would choose
the right hand wheat mallet has.

292
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,184

00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,579
The question is,how did he get there?

305
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,255
We have no alternative,
we must turn and fight.

306
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,357
But the weather gage,...

307
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,226
You must be watching it from somewhere...

308
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,193
Till it pass.

309
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,663

We must ban every sail...

313

We have to.

314
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,509
We must survive us there...

315
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,704

414
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,461
That is not a easy thing for this
kind of situation

415
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,766
For my own pal, who has die.

416
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:37,839
Subsequent , l need to persuade
myself to kill them.

417
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,193
...you have to choose.

418
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,493
The clue is, the cool Wally is popular

419
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,004
ls that express any feeling
that matter to you?

420
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,151
Check to the forum

421
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,944
Can l speak to my old friend?

422
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,248
lnto the ship captain.

423
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:27,364
Ship captain has said that, this is more
that the formal. - l'm not the lrish man

424
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,729
But, l'm the lrish man.

425
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,593
Were that is friend? -Has a friend.

426
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,161
l won't said, that l want.

427
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,745
Perhaps, we have to turn back.

428
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:51,850
The man, cause the fall of lucky Jack
anyway, with the confident to victory

429
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,483
That is life problem.

430
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,493
You are not the person to defeat.

431
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:04,464
And that said, you are larger, faster ship
with the long guns is beginning
to cause it price

432
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,363
This is not a question of life,
but question of duty. -Duty!

433
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,540
You can be what you like.

434
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:21,184
...this is a ship of war, i will do what they
require in order to do my duty.

435
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,151
Whatever the cost?

436
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,218
Whatever the cost.

437
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,283
Order is will not know about the cost.

438
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,892
Can we really claim is nothing but the duty.

439
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,398
That is the subject of deserve.

440
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:40,201
My order is to follow what they need
and proceed long time ago.

441
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,507
The wind is back, sir

442
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,983
Sir! We can't hold this any longer.

443
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,947
Can't sail through the damn wind,
we will sail around it.

444
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,382
Use south.

445
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,319

446
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,889

-Use south sir.

448
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,345

we header back to the sum.

450
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,158

So Mr. Spoon, you will start the meal.

457
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,912

00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:13,118
and you, do do rock.

459
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,618
You enjoy the island?

460
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:01,430
lt is full of strange and a wonderful beach.

461
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,730
We will stop there if we there.

462
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,164

01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:13,206
Several days at least, the people is kind...

l will like all this.

466
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,926
That is the whole point.

467
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,404
This is spider and this is the neck.

468
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,810
Here is the insect, it has a torn
to save herself from the bug.

469
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,125
Did god make them change?

470
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:04,616
Does god make them change, yeah.

471
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:08,027
They also change themselves.

472
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,199
That is the question, isn't it?

473
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,668
Sir, we saw the land

474
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,065

What is that thing?

477
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,081
Some types of bird.

478
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,646
That is the ugly devil. - Disgusting.

479
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:12,326
We can't see any women.

480
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,928
What! No women! That no true.

481
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,566
How extra-ordinary.

482
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,096
What is this, sir?

483
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,635
That is a species of birds.

484
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,871
You see that, they are in the develop.

485
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,107
l think that is out of the science

486
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,440
Giant stone got something.

487
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,348
...they are a types of iguana, l think.

488
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,722
They are vegetarian.

489
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:47,419
You can prepare one of them to the king.

490
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:51,592
The iguana swim. -The iguana don't swim.

491
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:52,860
This one did.

492
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:07,581
This was be damn, new species.

493
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,779
This remarkable.

494
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,403
Over there got a ship...

495
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:54,658

01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,236
Mr Carlos, food these all men. -Yes, sir.

497
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,204
Mr. Howard, stand your men down.

498
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:07,276
We are come back from France one week ago.

499
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:13,314
We are rob by the fucking pirates.

500
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,481
Who prisoner Captain Deff...

501
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:22,757
200 thousand pound, they have took.

502
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:30,399
And those cause?
-Maybe point to south west for the rest.

503
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,934
Mr. Polink. -Yes, sir.

504
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,736
Enter this man name in the ship book.

505
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:35,226
Mr. Alan set the cause.

506
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,641
Fix sail.

507
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,903
That is not the moment to lose.

508
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:03,499
Jack! Did you forgot your promise?

509
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,301
Subject to the requirement of service.

510
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:10,306
l can not concern delay and
take the advance...

511
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,739
No immediate application.

512
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,968
This is l think, it is a opportunity to...

513
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,608
lt's a long island.

514
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:27,589
l have not time to spend hours at here.

515
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:33,062
This is giving an important knowledge
and making variable of discovery...

516
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,997
it could help to advance our knowledge
and natural history.

517
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,330
There not, and l said no.

518
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,732
Oh, l see.

519
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:53,440
This is so off timing your services,
content me to this expedition.

520
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,188

No! you forgot yourself!

522
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,693
You forgotten yourself.

523
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:07,060
You see from my part,
l look upon my promises.

524
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,963
Would you end your damn hobby, sir?

525
01:06:56,245 --> 01:07:01,273
Mr. Blinkin.
-Slr, small insect in the back.

01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,920
l will sure of it.

527
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:15,391
lf we don't walk along the beach
then we can't come across.

528
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,398
You can have it sir.

529
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:47,326
Mr. Blinkin, thank you.

530
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,969
Stop the fire, sir.

531
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:08,913
Timing -2 minutes and 1 second, sir

532
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,142
That not good enough.

533
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,619
We define 2 types to 1 .

534
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,390
You wanna see, we be defeat?
-No!

535
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,922
You wanna see your children be suffer?
-No!

536
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,531
1 minutes and 10 second.

537
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,686
Well done, Mr. Carlomi.
-Thank you sir.

538
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,564

One more week, we will got all the prices of...
-We can't make it.

540
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:25,937
l can't enhance the wind and god damn creator.

541
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,712
l have never know such as the bad luck.

542
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:50,671
Save it, for the cold evil.

543
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,237
What that come from?

544
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,651
This is from the bible story of China.

545
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:11,251
They found out the shit, and one of the men

Pack up your things and

693
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:20,971
To the other side of the island.

So, Steven.

717
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:23,816
Did you see a bird?

No but yes.

01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:02,395
An insect.

729
01:40:04,732 --> 01:40:05,699
A predator.

730
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,751
No go too fast doctor.

By now on, no sound no whistle.

749
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,223
Only thirty of them lock down somewhere.

750
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:53,262
After board, take small part of it.

You are on the top not to crack.

785
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,160
More than twice our gun,
more than twice our numbers.

786
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,762

795

be dangerous like a wounded beast.

01:45:53,246 --> 01:45:56,181
Captain Howl and the ring
will sweep their deck.
