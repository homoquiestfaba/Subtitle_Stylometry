00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:07,519
Yeah.

187
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,565
What time?

188
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:10,827
Ah, you know.

189
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,176
Maybe sorta...

190
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:17,225
5:30, to be precise.

191
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,054
-All right.
-OK.

192
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,751
Good.
OK, yeah.

193
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,448
-OK.
-Thank you.

194
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:24,667
Yeah.

195
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:28,976
OK. Have fun with
the little monsters.

196
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:35,156
[thoughtful music]

197
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,159
[narrating]
And so we parted.

198
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,553
And I stumbled off to work.

199
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,817
Off to drudgery's cathedral.

200
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:47,734
My penitentiary.

201
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,695
The place I'm
swallowed each morning

202
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,437
and coughed out each night.

203
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,135
That strange netherworld
of mild tortures

204
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:02,618
where time itself has long since
given up bothering to pass.

205
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,017
No, mother, I'm not coming.

206
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,673
You know I hate Connecticut.

207
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,459
All those birds,
all those trees, it unsanitary.

208
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,679
-Tulley.
-Hold on.

209
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,116
Can't you see I'm having a
conversation with my mother?

210
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,730
Hey, Ma?

211
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,690
What did the banana
say to the vibrator?

212
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:31,952
"I don't know why
you're shaking.

213
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,475
She's gonna eat me!"

214
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,174
Yeah, well, think about it.

215
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,437
Call me when you get it.

216
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:40,787
Yeah.

217
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,834
You might find that interesting.

218
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,706
What is it?
Your resignation?

219
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,316
No.
It's the job you last proofed.

220
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:49,926
It is completely
riddled with errors.

221
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,798
Well, riddle me this, Batboy.

222
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,452
Why do you suppose there are
so many errors in this copy?

223
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,324
Because you're a
useless, drunken fool.

224
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,760
No, the reason my
socks don't match

225
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,631
is because I'm a useless,
drunken fool.

226
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,242
The reason there are so
many errors in this copy

227
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:04,288
is because your well-paid
copywriters can't spell.

228
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,637
I've already shown
that to Bonnie.

229
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,682
I think you should know that.

230
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,640
Let me ask you something, Scott.

231
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,644
Did you show it to her before
or after you had sex with her?

232
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,950
Because I would hate to think

233
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,865
that you're using me
as foreplay.

234
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,347
OK.
OK.

235
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,565
See what happens.

236
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,657
-Sorry.
-Jesus!

237
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,920
Sorry.

238
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,879
Scott's in a mood.

239
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,620
You have no idea.

240
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,404
That guy wants my job so bad

241
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:35,276
he'd run naked through
Grand Central Station to get it.

242
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:36,756
There's an ugly picture.

243
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,932
You think that's bad,
listen to this.

244
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,673
With new Clean and Clear
you will experience

245
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,980
a brightness as never before.

246
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,592
Before what?

247
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,029
Exactly.

248
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,382
Attention Kmart Shoppers!

249
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,254
Would a Christopher Boyer
please report to lost and found.

250
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,213
We have located your children.

251
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,911
Please pick them up before
we put them on sale!

252
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,873
It's just appalling...

253
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,963
You would think that this
boy had an I.Q. of a lentil.

254
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,488
Uh, you wanted to see me?

255
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,143
Do the names Strunk and White
mean anything to you at all?

256
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,274
Uh, no.

257
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,059
-Should they?
-Yes.

258
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,671
You're a good writer, Chris.

259
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,586
But even a Rolls Royce needs
a polish once in a while.

260
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,501
-Look it over.
-OK, thanks, thanks.

261
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:27,763
I will, I will.

262
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:30,897
Get out.

263
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,202
OK.

264
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,815
-Let us lunch.
-Woo-hoo!

265
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,339
[jazzy music]

266
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,515
[narrating]
Mm. What is there so sweet

267
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,604
as the surreptitious drink

268
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,694
poured down in the
middle of a working day?

269
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,870
You know, in some cultures
people do actually get fired

270
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,524
for drinking on the job.

271
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,961
You're not drinking.
I am.

272
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,528
Oh, you think if any of the
suits saw us sitting here

273
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,052
they would question
what I'm drinking?

274
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,446
Why don't you ask me
how my evening was?

275
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,101
How was your evening?

276
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:02,493
Oh, wait, no, let me guess.

277
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,148
You got drunk, picked up a girl,

278
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:08,891
you had sex with her, threw up
on her and then she left.

279
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,589
Not bad.
Four out of five.

280
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:12,852
She was still there
in the morning.

281
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,505
Get out.

282
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,943
Wow. Are you going to
actually see her again?

283
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:20,555
Tonight.
5:30 at the bar.

284
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,949
Well, congratulations, old man.

285
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,777
Do you mind if I tag along?

286
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,301
I would like to meet the woman

287
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,650
that can actually stand
you two nights in a row.

288
00:14:28,737 --> 00:14:30,391
Certainly, certainly.

289
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,915
Anything I can do to further
your miserable education.

290
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,355
Speaking of furthering
your education.

291
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:42,055
I'm about to teach you a
brilliant business maneuver.

292
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,448
What could you possibly
teach me about business?

293
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,841
I'm gonna teach you
how to get past Bonnie

294
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,408
and the suits
without being seen.

295
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,149
-What? Where?
-No, no, no.

296
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,238
About 10 paces behind you.
Don't look.

297
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,848
Oh, shit!

298
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,069
No, oh, shit later.
Just, follow my lead, OK?

299
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,376
Has anybody lost a wallet?

300
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,204
Black leather wallet?

301
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,424
OK, let's go.

302
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,123
[man] I don't know.

303
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,389
[woman]
That's yours isn't it?

304
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:14,957
[Tulley] And so we
escaped undetected.

305
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:19,744
A brilliant ruse and
this is how I expend my...

306
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,486
my, uh...

307
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,576
Mm.

308
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,535
Oh, shit, my...

309
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,798
You know, if you want
words to get on the paper

310
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,888
you have to actually
press down on the keys.

311
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,674
Why do you insist on using
that horseless carriage?
Hmm?

312
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,067
Because I don't want
the whole office

313
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,504
electronically
looking up my skirt.

314
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,941
-What time is it?
-Go home time.

315
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,594
Let's go.

316
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:44,639
Get out of here.

317
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:45,945
I give up.

318
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,557
I'm fucked.

319
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,560
You know, it is exhausting
trying to look busy all day

320
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:56,390
and then being brilliant on
top of that is just murder.

321
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,652
Don't I know it.

322
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,177
Let's go distribute the pain.

323
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,748
All right, all you,
self-proclaimed copywriters.

324
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,969
Your work sickens me

325
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,623
more than a plate of
chocolate covered herring.

326
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,885
And for that you must pay!

327
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,627
Frank!
Get thee to a dictionary!

328
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,716
Likewise, you, go hence!

329
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:22,242
And, fair Katherine,
my nostrils quiver in horror

330
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,026
at the stench you put before me.

331
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,767
And young Christopher...

332
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,251
Better.

333
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,041
[phone rings]

334
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,261
[receptionist] Bremec, Williams
and Jenicek, may I help you?

335
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,829
Hold on, Macduff.

336
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:52,750
Is she in?

337
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,839
Yes. And she does not
want to be disturbed.

338
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:57,103
Neither do I, but I
was born this way.

339
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,977
Bonnie! It's Tulley.
I'm leaving.

340
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,718
[Bonnie]
OK. Good night.

341
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:04,632
Have you seen Scott?

342
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,373
No, I haven't.

343
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,809
I thought you might have.

344
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,637
[Bonnie] No, I haven't.
Good night.

345
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:13,336
I wanted to answer a question
he had before I left.

346
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:15,251
[Bonnie]
Well, he's not here.

347
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:17,862
Yeah, he wanted to know
about a treatment for crabs.

348
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:21,388
Would you tell him that the
name of the shampoo is Bug-Rid.

349
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:24,173
B-U-G dash R-I-D.

350
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:28,786
[phone rings]

351
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,050
[Receptionist] Bremec, Williams
and Jenicek, may I help you?

352
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:32,877
It's for you.

353
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:35,532
[Bonnie] Tulley?

354
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:36,620
Yes?

355
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:37,708
[Bonnie]
Get out of here.

356
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,319
Whatever you say, General.

357
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:42,844
Thank you.

358
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,764
Oh, God, I hate
that drunken asshole.

359
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,244
Shhh.

360
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,638
[laughing]

361
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,693
I oughta start
charging you two rent.

362
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,782
We're just waiting for the bus.

363
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,305
It, it does come here, right?

364
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,135
She's late.

365
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,658
She'll be here.

366
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:16,486
You'll see.
She's a nice girl.

367
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:19,315
How did she deal with
hanging around you?

368
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:20,577
Oh, we have a lot in common.

369
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,318
Like?

370
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,928
Well, we both like to go
drinking on Wednesday night

371
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:26,496
and we both think
that I'm adorable.

372
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,238
And that, in your opinion,
makes her a nice girl?

373
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,022
Well, I admit that the depth
of my knowledge in this area

374
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,851
-is quite narrow, but, um...
-Yeah.

375
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,375
She's all right.

376
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,424
Is that her?

377
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,644
Mmm, Natalie!

378
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,820
Hey!

379
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,126
-Hi, sorry I'm late.
-How are you?

380
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,866
It's all right.

381
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:49,954
You waiting long?

382
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,131
Waiting is what I do best.

383
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,133
Natalie McConnell, Levine.

384
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,743
-Hello.
-Hi.

385
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,179
Levine can't believe
that a nice girl like you

386
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,703
would want to be
involved with someone me.

387
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,574
Nice to meet you.

388
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,315
[Levine] Pleasure.

389
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:03,707
And Tulley's wrong.

390
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,883
-I'm not a nice girl.
-You're not?

391
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,714
No. I was a nice girl 10 years
ago, but I outgrew it.

392
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,587
Can I get a vodka
cranberry please?

393
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,720
So is Levine your full name?

394
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:20,507
-Oh, yeah. Like Sting, Beck.
-Tulley.

395
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,248
Yeah, we couldn't
think of a second name.

396
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,858
-We have writer's block.
-Oh.

397
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,165
You another drinker
with a writing problem?

398
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,167
That's my line!

399
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,472
She walked right into it.

400
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,257
Fell for it's more like it.

401
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,998
Well. I'm nowhere near the
league that Tulley is in,

402
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,913
either as a drinker or a writer.

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,481
Did he tell you that he was
voted the most promising writer

404
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,788
of 1980 by the
National Review of Books?

405
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,311
No.

406
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,704
He's even had some
short stories published,

407
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,923
to say nothing of his novel.

408
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:47,795
You wrote a novel?

409
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:48,926
I'm writing a novel.

410
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,667
I'm still-still working on it.

411
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,713
How long have you
been working on it?

412
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,323
Let's see, what day is it today?

413
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,368
Thursday?

414
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,588
17 years.

415
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,155
You've been writing the
same book for 17 years?

416
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,809
Oh, yes.
I had writer's block,

417
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:03,637
so I took a decade
off for bad behavior.

418
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,116
But, can we talk
about another subject?

419
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,901
Let's talk about you.
How was your day?

420
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,990
How about we talk about
another other subject?

421
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,558
OK. Levine?
Ask me how she was in bed.

422
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:12,515
Don't you dare.

423
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,604
How was she in bed?

424
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,389
You say one word
and the rest of this

425
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,738
is going over your head.

426
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,261
Oh, don't worry.

427
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:20,567
I would never believe
anything he said.

428
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,831
Actually, she was...
wonderful.

429
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,399
Very unselfish.

430
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:28,705
Thanks.

431
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,751
That was sweet of you.

432
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,056
I meant every word.

433
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,409
What time is it, Levine?

434
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:41,805
It's either a quarter
past one or January 15th.

435
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,720
I hope my train
is still running.

436
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,244
How many times do
I have to tell you?

437
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,811
You're not in Boston anymore.

438
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,639
The trains run all night here.

439
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:51,641
Here we go.

440
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,295
The bars are open
until four a.m.

441
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,775
Yeah.

442
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:55,906
And the streets
are paved with gold

443
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,212
and all the women

444
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,474
-are gorgeous...
-Yeah, I know.

445
00:20:58,561 --> 00:20:59,867
-Boston sucks.
-and available.

446
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,651
We're all backwards
and repressed

447
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:04,350
because of that
one o'clock last call.

448
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:06,134
-Oh, it's barbaric!
-It's terrible.

449
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,963
Three hours of less drinking
is barbaric?

450
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,792
Never underestimate
the value of alcohol.

451
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,402
It brought us together.

452
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,925
He's right.

453
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,014
You know, drinking
will improve everything,

454
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:21,758
your writing, your jokes,
your love life.

455
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,239
Levine, are you seeing anyone?

456
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,371
Just Tulley.

457
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,895
[Tulley]
Hmm. You're sweet.

458
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:30,854
You know, I feel kind
of funny being here.

459
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,553
I could've gotten a cab.

460
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,816
Think nothing of it,
I couldn't bear the idea

461
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,209
of you trekking
all the way back to Siberia.

462
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,429
-Brooklyn.
-Same thing.

463
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,866
You just sleep on
the couch as usual

464
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,868
and I'm gonna go in the
other room and have some fun.

465
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,305
As usual.

466
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,829
You know,
I gotta get me one of those.

467
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,657
She's-she's all right.

468
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,095
Yeah, she is.

469
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:58,186
Oh, I meant to, ah, I meant
to give this back to you.

470
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:01,668
I read it.

471
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,626
It's very good.

472
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:06,150
It's depressing,
but it's what you do best.

473
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,717
Well, thanks.

474
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:10,067
I just wish I could
make some money at this.

475
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,678
No, no, no, no.
You don't want that.

476
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,593
No.
Not at all.

477
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,813
No, no, you-you're not
interested in money, Levine.

478
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,817
I definitely think that you are
leaning toward the artistic.

479
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,863
Well, I guess
I'll just follow your lead.

480
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,473
Don't do that.

481
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,909
Just remember what the
bumper sticker says.

482
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,216
"Don't follow me, I'm lost".

483
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,350
Goodnight.

484
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:34,265
[Natalie laughs]

485
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,703
Good morning.

486
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,313
[ladies] Good morning.

487
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,749
[instructor] We're gonna
start our morning now

488
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,360
with our stretches.

489
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,536
First, we have to breathe
in always in the morning.

490
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:46,843
Stand with your feet
shoulder width apart.

491
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,715
Levine.

492
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,020
Hey, wake up.

493
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,546
Oh, let me guess.

494
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:54,764
New York City.

495
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:56,853
Sometime in the 21st century.

496
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,551
Two out of two.

497
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:01,336
Up. Shower's all yours.

498
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,251
What time is it?

499
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,818
It's either 7:30
or the Ides of March.

500
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,211
Come on, hop to it.
Let's go.

501
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:10,345
Cutting back, I see.
Still no coffee?

502
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,913
Somebody told me that caffeine
was bad for your system,

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,874
but if you don't care who
or what goes inside of you.

504
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,702
Oh, my God.
You made me coffee.

505
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:21,312
Hey, it's instant,
it's not real coffee.

506
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,923
That's OK.
Instant's good.

507
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,446
Just take it easy, all right?

508
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,752
I didn't go buying
furniture or anything.

509
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,318
I just boiled some damned water.

510
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,277
OK.

511
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:32,889
Thanks.

512
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:36,937
See you tonight.

513
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:39,418
You're pretty sure of
yourself, aren't you?

514
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:41,724
No.

515
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:44,292
Pretty sure of you, though.

516
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,992
[Levine scatting]

517
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,660
Hi.

518
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,273
May I help you?

519
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,188
I have a question.

520
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,974
I swear I did not hear you
guys having loud, raucous sex.

521
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,194
That's not my question.

522
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,719
It's about his drinking.
How much of a problem is it?

523
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,504
Oh, he's definitely
an alcoholic.

524
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,680
He's not a violent
or a stupid drunk.

525
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,682
He just drinks
because he enjoys it.

526
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,510
At least, that's
what he tells me.

527
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,947
You believe him?

528
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,471
No, but I respect his right

529
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,430
to screw up his life
however he chooses.

530
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,779
We've all got our demons.

531
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:38,302
Yeah, but he's killing himself.

532
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,261
Well, take it from me.

533
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,916
If you mention that to him,
he'll never speak to you again.

534
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:44,831
OK.

535
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:49,575
One more question.

536
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,664
Shoot.

537
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,448
I know this is gonna sound
stupid my having to ask,

538
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,363
but could you tell me
his first name?

539
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,583
[laughs] I love it
when he does this.

540
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,976
I knew him for about
a week before I found out.

541
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,196
-It's Ryan.
-Ryan.

542
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:04,677
Doesn't he like his first name?

543
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,113
I don't know.

544
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,723
Everyone just calls him Tulley.

545
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,204
Probably because
he's always getting yelled at.

546
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:13,816
Hey, aren't you-aren't you
curious about my first name?

547
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,078
Tulley told me.

548
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:16,297
It's Daniel.

549
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:17,690
My God.

550
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:20,344
-He told you the truth.
-Yep.

00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,824

Friday morning.

554

Time for my weekly
lecture from Bonnie.

555
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,363
Hello, Bonnie.

556
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,626
I just want to know...

557
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:45,544
what goes on in that
gin-soaked head of yours.

558
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,589
If you really must know,

559
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,591
I was trying to remember

560
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,725
where the first place
was that we, uh...

[whistles]

562
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,163
[narrating]
What happened to her?

563
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,558
Why does she act like this?

564
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:04,127
Why's she wearing that blouse?

565
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:06,739
I mean, when she first
came here, she was...

566
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,045
she was so sweet.

567
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,006
We had a raging affair
that lasted months,

568
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:16,400
I mean, there is not
a surface in this room

569
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:19,490
on which she and I
have not had sex.

570
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:22,581
What happened to all that?

571
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,062
Where'd it all go?

572
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,890
You finished?

573
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,588
I am.

574
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,459
No, I just remembered
where we first made it.

575
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,374
It was right here on the desk
and then it was on the couch

576
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:36,638
and then it was on the floor,
so it went desk, couch, floor.

577
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,422
Let it go, Tulley!

578
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,512
What do you think
happened to us?

579
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:43,732

before going back to work.

589

[Tulley] Hmm?

609
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:20,568

you're this close

to losing your freaking job.

611
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,225
Don't worry about it, Levine.

612
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,705
Why would somebody
who hates kids

613
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,750
so much become a school teacher?

614
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,578
The point is, if you know
they're out to get you,

615
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,014
then why hand them the ax

616
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:33,929

your head off, right?

00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:35,714
Don't get me wrong, I don't
like kids that much myself,

618

but I don't work with any.

So, you refuse to listen?

You just refuse to
straighten yourself out?

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,723

so excited about?

623

00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,064
Can I buy you a drink?

716
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,326
Sure!

717
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:01,414
Kelly!

718
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,633
Vodka and cranberry, please.

719
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,505
Good memory.

720
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,637
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

♪ It's a lonely ♪

722
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,687
♪ Such a lonely ♪

723
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:16,124
Levine, can I ask
you a question?

724
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,692
You want me to get
in the shower first?

725
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,302
What do you think
of Tulley's writing?

726
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:21,695
Oh, I've never read any of it.

727
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:22,870
He won't let me.

728
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,699
I just read his short stories.

729
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,614
They're really good.

730
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,920
All about his growing up
in New York.

731
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,661
Surprisingly sad stuff.

732
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,054
You'd better stash that.

733
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,621
If he sees it,
he'll pitch a fit!

734
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,015
Why don't you take it?

735
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,585
[Natalie] Is he any
relation to the Ryan Tulley?

736
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:43,978
Oh, yeah, that's his father,

737
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:45,675
but you didn't hear it from me.

738
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:48,026
He's full of secrets, isn't he?

739
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:51,029
Yeah. But he's obviously
nuts about you.

740
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:55,207
How do you know?

741
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:56,730
I'm Levine.

742
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,123
It's my job to know.

744
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,266
Whoo!

745
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:13,268
Not bad for a broken down drunk.

746
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:15,488
That was great.

747
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,011
I really miss playing
with those guys.

748
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,013
Yeah? You gonna go on tour
with them, Pops?

749
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,667
You kidding?

750
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,060
I could barely survive
the walk to the subway.

751
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,757
Hey, there's a table.
Want to grab it?

752
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,063
Yeah.

[Levine] Here you go.

754
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:34,550
You know, I think
I need a drink.

755
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,682
Oh, let me get it for you.

756
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,336
Oh, would you?

757
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:38,772
You just stay here
and enjoy your groupie.

758
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,342
You sounded really great.

759
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,865
Your face got so red

760
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,345
I was afraid your head
was gonna explode.

761
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,999
Oh, I was saving
that for the finale.

-Oh!
-Tough day at the office?

No, you don't even
know the half of it.

Another.

Yes, Master.

And hurry.

769
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,191
What happened?

770
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,410
We do not speak about it.

771
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,631

You see that?

772
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:13,589
That was it.

773
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:14,677
There.

774
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,375
Right there.

has begun to tick.

-Thanks.
-How's your head?

797
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,687
Oh, it's probably
just a concussion.

798

A few weeks in a coma
and I should be fine.

if you die in the
middle of the night,

You don't suppose
she's got a sister?

Three brothers.

when you're done with that,

There's a shock.

ready for that one.

So I said to the girl,

844
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,308
"Never sleep with a
first time writer.

845
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:17,050

to back up the advances."

Well, when it comes
to attracting women,

expert, aren't you, Hamilton?

we dose, but never close.

00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:29,367
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I'll be right back.

851
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:48,516
Is this some kind of joke?

852
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:51,345
Actually, it's a snack.

853
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:54,000
I was hoping to have some lunch,

854
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:56,785
but uh, they wouldn't let me in.

855
00:39:56,872 --> 00:39:58,091
Why wouldn't they?

856
00:39:58,178 --> 00:39:59,484
Look at yourself.

857
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:01,834
You're disgusting!

858
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:03,618
Ryan, I'm sorry we're late,

859
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,403
but I couldn't get
Dunleavy to move his ass.

860
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,883
I'm gonna bust my ass for
a lousy bloody cup of tea?

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,972
Go on inside and I'll
join you later, all right?

-Hey.

gentlemen.

This oughta be fun,
the whole wax works is here.

865
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,026
Let's take a walk.

866
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:22,376
Ryan, I didn't
invite you down here

867
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,552
to embarrass me in
front of my friends.

868
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,249
I asked you because your
mother wants to know

869
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,034
what you intend to do about
your sister's wedding.

870
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,036
Tell her I'm getting
my shotgun polished.

871
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,559
The ceremony is in two weeks

872
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:33,648
and she wants to know if
you're going to attend.

873
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,563
She's actually inviting me?

874
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,871
Yes. Despite the spectacle you
made at your brother's wedding.

875
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,527
Well, they said it
was an open bar.

876
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:45,443
The point is that your mother
very much wants you to do this.

877
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,706
It'd please her greatly.

878
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,274
There's $500 in there.

879
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,363
Get yourself a decent suit.

880
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,455
You're bribing me to go?

881
00:40:57,542 --> 00:41:00,109
I'm asking you to go.

882
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,766
Well, we wouldn't wanna
upset Mother, would we?

883
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:07,029
That would be your department.

884
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,944
Why didn't she ask me herself?

885
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,557
She's having one
of her illnesses.

886
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:14,515
What happened?
She run out of scotch?

887
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,910
Look who's talking.

888
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,520
You know, I just
can't understand

889
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:21,740
how you can let yourself
get into this condition.

890
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:27,267
Did you ever have
writer's block?

891
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,790
No.

892
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:31,880
How about jock itch?
Ever get jock itch?

893
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:34,840
Do you ever get anything
that the rest of us fucking
lowly humans get?

894
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,494
I can't talk to you
when you're like this. Goodbye.

895
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,060
What do you mean "goodbye",
what about lunch?

896
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,366
You're not getting any lunch.

897
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:40,889
[laughs]
I'm not getting any lunch?

898
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:42,804
What are you, sending me
to my fucking room?

899
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:44,719
Try to get yourself
together by the wedding.

900
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:47,287
-Two weeks!
-Two weeks!

901
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:54,120
Absolutely true, we both wrote
the names down on our napkin,

902
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:56,818
Hitler, Stalin, Walter Romelli.

903
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:01,954
Sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you to move along.

904
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:06,828
What a bunch of bullshit.

905
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:09,048
This is bullshit!

906
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:12,051
Everybody-everybody
thinks that he's some

907
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,923
Harvard educated blue blood.

908
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,534
Do you know where he's from?

909
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,144
He's from Queens.

910
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:21,669
He's a shoe clerk
from fucking Woodside Queens!

911
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:23,149
-Would you like me...
-Woodside!

912
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,933
Would you like me
to call you a cab?

913
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,065
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

914
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:27,762
I'll call you a cab.

915
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:31,592
You're a yellow fucking cab,
you piece of shit!

916
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,421
Sir, if you don't move along
I'm going to call the police.

917
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:35,640
Go ahead, I don't give a shit.

918
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,642
I don't give a shit.
Call 'em.

919
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:39,600
Call the fucking police!

920
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,863
It'll serve him right,
the bastard.

921
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,822
Look, I just came
here for lunch.

922
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,519
I want my lunch.

923
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:48,914
I just want fucking,
just want lunch.

924
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:49,828
Fuck!

925
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:52,657
[tense music]

926
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:56,051
[narrating]
You go so long

927
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,358
thinking that you have
all the time in the world.

928
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:00,708
[grunts]

929
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:03,276
And then one day you
discover that you don't.

930
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:07,367
It was a transition
I have to admit

931
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:10,370
that I made rather awkwardly.

932
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:31,696
It's funny how easily
people dismiss you

933
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:35,047
when you're lying
on the sidewalk.

934
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:37,266
It's as though, it's as though,

935
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:39,791
they aren't surprised
to see you there.

936
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:03,771
Where's Tulley?

937
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:05,338
[Levine] Not my
turn to watch him.

938
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:06,513
Cut the crap.

939
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,470
He's what?

940
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:08,515
Three hours late?

941
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,038
[Levine] So?

942
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,474
We have a lot of work
to do around here.

943
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:12,867
If he shows up shitfaced,
let's just say...

944
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,477
Shitfaced?

945
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:16,436
Is that anything like
being a brown nose?

946
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:19,526
You keep joking, but your
little playmate's going down

947
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:23,661
and if you keep protecting him,
you're next.

948
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:38,284
-Hey, Levine.
-Hey!

949
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,765
-Hi.
-Where's your better half?

950
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:43,158
I don't know. He never
showed up to work today.

951
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,378
Really?
Did you call his place?

952
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:46,553
No.

953
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,555
You want a drink?

954
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:49,730
Let's call his place.

955
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:53,778
[phone ringing]

956
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,260
[recording of Tulley]
You've reached Tulley.

957
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:00,175
Friends of mine know better
than to call me here.

958
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:02,700
The rest of you can all
go to... [machine beeps]

959
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:06,138
[Levine] Well, I see you
took my advice and cleaned up
your message.

960
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:08,618
Uh, I'm down here at
the bar with Natalie

961
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,186
and we are running
off to Bora Bora

962
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,885
and we just wanted you
to be the first to know.

963
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:15,930
Tulley?

964
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:19,673
Tulley, are you there?

965
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,806
Tulley?
Are you screening?

966
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:22,937
Pick up.

967
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:24,722
[beeps]

968
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:31,250
[thoughtful music]

969
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:37,691
Geoffrey.

970
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,171
Hi, Tulley.

971
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,135
Tulley?

972
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,580
Tulley?

973
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:00,453
We're all about to go home.
Just about given up on you.

974
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,630
Hey.

975
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:10,768
How was Bora Bora?

976
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,379
Where were you?

977
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:14,946
What are you,
my parole officer?

978
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:16,295
No.

979
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:19,124
I was just... I was worried.

980
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:24,346
Yeah, well, I'm touched.

981
00:46:24,433 --> 00:46:25,478
Natalie was worried too.

982
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:27,523
She's coming by the bar tonight.

983
00:46:29,612 --> 00:46:31,266
Fine.

984
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:35,009
You look awful.

985
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:37,707
Thank you. You know, you're not
exactly giving Brad Pitt

986
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,622
a run for his money yourself.

987
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:44,889
How was lunch with your Dad?

988
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:47,456
It was fine.

989
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:50,155
He asked me how I was,
he gave me advice,

990
00:46:50,242 --> 00:46:51,765
he picked up the check,

991
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:53,288
he sent me home with
a high priced hooker.

992
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:54,899
The usual.

993
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:58,554
Well...

994
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:00,774
How about I buy you a drink?

995
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:10,088
Vodka neat.

996
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:13,787
Uh, beer.

997
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,877
What kind?

998
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,792
I don't care.
Whatever you got.

999
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,231
Since when do you drink beer?

1000
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,059
Since when do you ask
so many questions?

1001
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:27,148
Sorry.

1002
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:29,411
Jesus, Tulley.

1003
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,675
What the hell have you
been doin' to yourself?
You look like shit.

1004
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:34,112
Knock off the sweet talk, Kelly.

1005
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,200
You're getting
the same tip as always.

1006
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:36,941
There you are.

1007
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,290
You had us worried sick.

1008
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:39,204
Where were you?

1009
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,509
He's not telling.

1010
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:44,557
Tulley, you look like shit.

1011
00:47:44,644 --> 00:47:46,341
Well, now it's unanimous

1012
00:47:46,428 --> 00:47:47,821
Vodka cranberry, please.

1013
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,085
So, how was school, darling?

1014
00:47:51,172 --> 00:47:52,870
Don't ask.
I got a promotion.

1015
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,741
-Hey!
-More work. Less fun.

1016
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:56,003
All hail the new millennium.

1017
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,526
[Kelly]
Happy hour's over.

1018
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:00,660
I hate that.

1019
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,270
What?

1020
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:03,228
-The bell.
-"Ask not

1021
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:04,577
for whom the bell tolls.

1022
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,448
It tolls for thee."

1023
00:48:06,535 --> 00:48:08,537
I'm gonna go.

1024
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:10,104
Tulley.
What are you doing?

1025
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:12,063
Nothing.
I'm just gonna go.

1026
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,456
Would you cut out the bullshit
and tell me what's wrong?

1027
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:15,805
Oh, you're sick of
the bullshit already?

1028
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,894
That didn't take long.

1029
00:48:16,981 --> 00:48:18,808
Goddamn it, Tulley, talk to me.

1030
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,508
Honey! Must we fight
in front of the kids?

1031
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:25,032
Well, if this is the
way you're gonna be,
then you might as well go.

1032
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,816
Yeah, fine.
I'll give you a call.

1033
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:29,776
You don't have my number.

1034
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,040
Let me make it
really simple for ya.

1035
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:34,824
We had a great time.
It's been fun.

1036
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,478
And it's time to move on.

1037
00:48:36,565 --> 00:48:37,653
What are you talking about?

1038
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,133
I'm talking about me.

1039
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,614
I don't wanna be your
next project, OK?

1040
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:43,572
If you need some way
to fill in your time,

1041
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:46,793
try fucking basket weaving,
but leave me the fuck alone.

1042
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:55,758
What the hell was that about?

1043
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:56,977
Bastard.

1044
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:02,983
[Tulley, narrating] She would be
better off now, free of me.

1045
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:05,812
And I'd be better off too.

1046
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:10,338
Why on Earth would I want
some love struck woman

1047
00:49:10,425 --> 00:49:12,688
weeping over me as I declined.

1048
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:16,127
Right?

1049
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,346
No, that's shit.

1050
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:19,434
[tapping at door]

1051
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:21,523
[Levine] Tulley?

1052
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,611
Tulley, open up.

1053
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:24,091
I know you're in there.

1054
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:25,527
Go away.
Can't you read the welcome mat?

1055
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:26,746
Get Lost.

1056
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:29,531
Hello?

1057
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:31,055
How did you get a key?

1058
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:31,969
[Levine] You gave it to me.

1059
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,318
Well, give it back!

1060
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,149
Why are you being so mysterious?

1061
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:40,020
I'm not being mysterious,
I'm being difficult.

1062
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:42,892
I thought your specialty
was satire, not melodrama.

1063
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,329
Yeah, well, I can't do either

1064
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:46,026
if I'm sitting here
talking to you.

1065
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:47,767
-Now, will ya take a hike?
-Oh. I need a drink.

1066
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,638
[Tulley] Yeah, well,
there's a bar on every corner.

1067
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:50,639
Can I get you something?

1068
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:51,858
Yes, you can get lost!

1069
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:53,164
[Levine]
What are you drinking?

1070
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:54,034
[groans]

1071
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:55,862
Water.

1072
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:57,995
Water?

1073
00:49:58,082 --> 00:49:59,213
Yes, water.

1074
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,432
Is there anything
wrong with that?

1075
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,216
No, no, nothing.

1076
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,740
I'm just surprised to find it
within 10 feet of you.

1077
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:06,090
I'll get you some more.

1078
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,397
[Tulley groans]

1079
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:12,487
[unsettling music]

1080
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:50,090
You still here?

1081
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,136
Where is my water?

1082
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,530
Did you drink all
that booze in there?

1083
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,532
No.
I had help from some friends.

1084
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,665
Bullshit. Other than me,
you don't have any friends.

1085
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:02,102
OK. I had help from
some thirsty enemies.

1086
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:05,366
Hey, I'm not leaving
until I get an answer.

1087
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,634
Did you drink all that booze?

1088
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:15,159
No. I poured it down
the drain, OK?

1089
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:16,595
Ya happy now?

1090
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:19,119
That's terrific, Tulley.

1091
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:21,034
That's, that is a
terrific first step.

1092
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:22,122
Maybe you can quit.

1093
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,558
I have quit.

1094
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:29,260
Well, that's...
I don't know what to say.

1095
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:31,175
How about goodbye?

1096
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,829
I think that is, this is the
smartest thing you could do.

1097
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:35,701
What the fuck is wrong
with you, all right?

1098
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,659
I don't want you here!

1099
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:40,009
Get out or I'm gonna push you
through the fucking keyhole!

1100
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,620
-What are you getting
so upset about?
-This is none of your business!

1101
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,056
And what is this, what were
you doing in a hospital?

1102
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,492
That's none of your
fucking business.

1103
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:46,625
Why were you
poking through my shit?

1104
00:51:46,712 --> 00:51:48,540
-I'm your friend
and I'm concerned about you.
-Yes, you have no right.

1105
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,324
-[groans] Fuck!
-Tulley?

1106
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:52,326
Hey, you all right?

1107
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,589
[groans]

1108
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:57,114
Call an ambulance.

1109
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:06,471
Operator? Operator,
could you get me a-a
hospital in Manhattan?

1110
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:08,690
No, you moron, call 911!

1111
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,866
Never mind.

1112
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,220
Hang on.

1113
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,840
[Tulley] Lying there
I made a realization.

1114
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:31,626
I realized that I would
spend a large part

1115
00:52:31,713 --> 00:52:36,849
of the remainder of my life
staring at the ceiling.

1116
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:50,384
[chatter and laughter]

1117
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,821
[boy] Throw it!

1118
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:00,916
Natalie.

1119
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:06,879
Levine.

1120
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:09,708
What are you doing here?

1121
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,666
I didn't go into work today.

1122
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:14,756
I was playing hooky.

1123
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,498
How is the asshole?

1124
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:20,936
He's dying.

1125
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:28,335
No, I'm-I'm serious,
he's-he's dying.

1126
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:30,903
What happened?

1127
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,558
He collapsed.

1128
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:35,821
Uh, his liver's shot.

1129
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:38,563
Um, they took out a
big chunk of his colon

1130
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:41,870
and put in a colostomy
bag, but uh, there's-

1131
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:44,656
there's not much
that they can do.

1132
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,793
God!

1133
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:54,100
Yeah.

1134
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:58,060
[thoughtful music]

1135
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:01,673
Take it easy there, Pops.

1136
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,631
Is that bag uncomfortable?

1137
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:06,330
[Tulley] Yeah, but
worse than that,
it clashes with my shoes.

1138
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,070
[Levine] Excuse me.

1139
00:54:08,157 --> 00:54:09,898
It's good to be home.
I have a lot of stuff to do.

1140
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:11,552
Yeah, listen, before we go in,

1141
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,206
there's something
I got to tell you.

1142
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:14,990
What, you want to carry
me over the threshold?

1143
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:17,036
No.

1144
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,472
Natalie's inside.

1145
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:21,649
Anything else?

1146
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:23,956
She's making a pot roast.

1147
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:26,175
After we eat,
I'm gonna kill you.

1148
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:31,572
Look what I found
out by the curb.

1149
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:33,879
A real fixer-upper.

1150
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:37,274
Hello, Tulley.

1151
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:39,798
Hi, Teach.

1152
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:41,800
You look good.

1153
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:44,672
Thanks.

1154
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:46,283
Wish I could say the same.

1155
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:51,288
Listen, I'm really sorry
about being such a...

1156
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:53,594
Jerk?

1157
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:54,769
Asshole?

1158
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:56,554
Pain in the ass?

1159
00:54:56,641 --> 00:54:57,859
Ah, take your pick.

1160
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:04,126
Save your apologies.

1161
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:05,824
I might owe you one
after you taste my cooking.

1162
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:13,266
Mmm.

1163
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:17,357
So?

1164
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:18,663
What do you think?

1165
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,968
About what?

1166
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:22,275
The food.

1167
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:29,021
Oh, so this is food.

1168
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:31,023
I've heard a lot about it.

1169
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,460
Hey, it's hard to
have an appetite

1170
00:55:33,547 --> 00:55:35,375
when you're wearing your
waste outside your pants.

1171
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:37,203
The doctors said you should
have stayed in the hospital.

1172
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,119
It'd be cheaper for me to
stay at Club Med for a week.

1173
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,991
I just...

1174
00:55:43,078 --> 00:55:46,212
I just need to rest,
I just need to detox a little.

1175
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:49,171
I'd say you need to detox a lot.

1176
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,088
I need to finish my book.

1177
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:54,612
How far along are you?

1178
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:57,789
Not far enough.

1179
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:06,058
[sighs] You know, I think
I need to lay down.

1180
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:08,277
Here, let-let me
get the dishes.

1181
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,366
[Tulley]
Just throw 'em out.

1182
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,193
I don't use 'em that much.

1183
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,769
Jesus, Tulley, you're soaking.

1184
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:24,816
Oh!
I'm taking these pills.

1185
00:56:24,903 --> 00:56:27,514
I don't know what they're for,
but they're making my skin leak.

1186
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,951
[gentle music]

1187
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:31,257
You shouldn't take pills

1188
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,433
if you don't know
what they're for.

1189
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,957
Thank you for
the advice, doctor.

1190
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:41,746
Honey, don't.

1191
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:42,834
What's it look like?

1192
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,445
[Tulley] You don't
have to do that.

1193
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,622
I know.

1194
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,145
But I also know if I don't,

1195
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:52,409
you're gonna sleep
in the damned things.

1196
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,672
What's wrong with
sleeping in your shoes?

1197
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:56,195
Hemingway slept in his shoes.

1198
00:56:57,152 --> 00:56:59,285
-No, he didn't.
-No?

1199
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:02,201
Damn, another myth exploded.

1200
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:09,338
Natalie?

1201
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,430
Come here.

1202
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:17,129
Come on, please, come here.

1203
00:57:17,216 --> 00:57:19,958
Please?
Come here. Come on.

1204
00:57:27,226 --> 00:57:28,532
Come on!

1205
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,273
-[groans]
-You OK?

1206
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,540
Yeah. [winces] I just have to be
careful how I twist around.

1207
00:57:36,627 --> 00:57:37,628
OK.

1208
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:39,934
[groans]

1209
00:57:45,244 --> 00:57:47,551
-This OK?
-Mmm.

1210
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:48,769
That's good.

1211
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:55,428
You'll let me know
if I hurt you?

1212
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:59,127
-Oh, I will.
-OK.

1213
00:57:59,214 --> 00:58:01,782
You know, I can't tell
you how horny I've been.

1214
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:06,091
Tulley, you do know how to
sweet talk a girl, don't you?

1215
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:09,181
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I was
in the hospital for three days,

1216
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:12,184
I was completely immobilized.

1217
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:14,839
I became totally sex-obsessed.

1218
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,405
It's all those nurses.

1219
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,625
Mmm. All those nurses.

1220
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,584
In their little white
starched uniforms?

1221
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:22,063
The little white
starched uniforms.

1222
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,848
That was a torture.

1223
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:29,244
Let's see if we can get you
a little more relaxed.

1224
00:58:29,331 --> 00:58:31,290
Let's see if we can.

1225
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:37,209
[groans]

1226
00:58:42,214 --> 00:58:45,478
Ah. Ah.

1227
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,567
-It's not good.
-OK.

1228
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:49,134
It's the incision, it's just...

1229
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:50,527
Ah!

1230
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,529
-[groans]
-OK.

1231
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:54,356
[Tulley]
I just, I can't do it.

1232
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:57,272
OK.
It's OK. It's OK.

1233
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:09,633
This is so humiliating.

1234
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,460
You're sick.

1235
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,115
-It's not humiliating.
-No, I just can't, you know.

1236
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:17,945
It's OK.

1237
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:24,212
Listen, why don't you
give-give Levine a hand?

1238
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,388
OK?

1239
00:59:26,475 --> 00:59:27,955
I need to catch my breath.

1240
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:35,963
-OK.
-OK.

1241
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,898
How's he doing?

1242
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,336
OK.

1243
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,991
Still frisky.

1244
01:00:04,078 --> 01:00:05,645
Oh, that's a good sign.

1245
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:09,127
You know, if his blood
gets cleaned up enough,

1246
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:11,956
they might be able to
get him a new liver.

1247
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,351
I feel kinda helpless.

1248
01:00:16,438 --> 01:00:19,224
I wanna do something,
but I don't know what.

1249
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:21,313
We just gotta watch him.

1250
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,665
They told me that he'll have
fatigue, day and night sweats,

1251
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:30,235
bleeding, wounds that
won't heal, hallucinations.

1252
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:33,630
Why did he have to fuck
himself up like that?

1253
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,766
Fuck! Who am I kidding?

1254
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:44,423
I sat right next to him...
the whole time.

1255
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,468
It was fun.

1256
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:50,908
It was fun.

1257
01:00:50,995 --> 01:00:55,434
He could think of the most
outrageous ways to waste time.

1258
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,534
Go home, Levine.
You're tired.

1259
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:11,668
I'll stay here tonight.

1260
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:17,630
[Tulley]
A peculiar thing

1261
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:19,980
about being slammed up
against your mortality

1262
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,896
is that it changes things.

1263
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:29,947
Things, people, they all
get turned upside down.

1264
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:31,905
[Bonnie] How's Tulley?

1265
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:33,559
Not good.

1266
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:35,909
When's he getting
out of the hospital?

1267
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,739
He's out. He's home.

1268
01:01:39,826 --> 01:01:41,175
What?

1269
01:01:43,308 --> 01:01:45,702
Yes, Mother,
it's worse than a cold.

1270
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:48,226
What do you mean?

1271
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:53,622
Oh. Put it this way,
remember that bike I wanted

1272
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,190
when I was 10 years old?

1273
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:58,976
Uh-hmm. Well, if you're ever
gonna get it for me,

1274
01:01:59,063 --> 01:01:59,890
this would be the year.

1275
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:01,543
[Bonnie] Tulley?

1276
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:02,501
Bonnie?

1277
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:03,632
Ma, let me call you back.

1278
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,025
My boss is here to yell at me.

1279
01:02:05,112 --> 01:02:06,287
Tulley!

1280
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:08,550
How the hell did you get keys?

1281
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:10,248
Levine gave me his set.

1282
01:02:10,335 --> 01:02:12,380
What the hell are you
doing out of the hospital?

1283
01:02:12,467 --> 01:02:14,513
They didn't have
the Playboy Channel.

1284
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,341
Do you know that the
company can't cover you

1285
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:17,646
if you sit at home?

1286
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,083
Fuck the company.

1287
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,780
[Bonnie] You have
to be hospitalized.

1288
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:23,609
I am not gonna die in some
fucking hospital, OK?

1289
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:26,699
Look. If you won't go back
to the hospital,

1290
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,570
maybe you can do
some work at home.

1291
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:30,616
I can't.
I gotta finish my book.

1292
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:32,574
If you do a little work at home,

1293
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,533
I can put you on the books.

1294
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,885
Do what you can and
I'll go to bat for you, OK?

1295
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:44,804
I'll look it over and
make some revisions

1296
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:47,154
and send it back with Levine.

1297
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:48,590
That'll be fine.

1298
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:49,940
[Tulley] Bonnie,
do me a favor, will you?

1299
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:51,724
What?

1300
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:54,640
When I'm dead, will you throw
my ashes in Scott's face?

1301
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:57,686
He's really not
that bad, Tulley.

1302
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,818
He came with me today.

1303
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,341
Really?

1304
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:02,126
Where's he hiding, in your bra?

1305
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,736
He's downstairs.

1306
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:07,087
He felt a little
uncomfortable about coming up.

1307
01:03:07,174 --> 01:03:08,480
Really?

1308
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,575
No sir, it's pretty obvious
the guy can't hack it anymore.

1309
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:18,795
You know, it's time to
go to a younger team.

1310
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:21,754
Tulley?

1311
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,365
Tulley, what are you doing?

1312
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:25,714
There you are.

1313
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,152
So sweet and unsuspecting.

1314
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,155
[Bonnie] Tulley.

1315
01:03:31,242 --> 01:03:32,634
[Scott] No sir,
you're absolutely right.

1316
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,375
Oh, my God!

1317
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:35,768
Bombs away!

1318
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:36,987
That's the bottom line.

1319
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:41,034
[gasps]

1320
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:42,079
Yes!

1321
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,471
Is that shit?

1322
01:03:43,558 --> 01:03:47,606
Is that shit?
Is that shit?

1323
01:03:47,693 --> 01:03:49,173
[Tulley] Anything else?

1324
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,610
No. I have to get back
to the office.

1325
01:03:51,697 --> 01:03:55,657
I'm putting a spot on for B&G.

1326
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,442
I'm gonna be premiering
it at the meeting.

1327
01:03:57,529 --> 01:04:00,619
Oh, I'm so sorry
I'm missing that.

1328
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:11,151
[Bonnie] Tulley?

1329
01:04:13,762 --> 01:04:15,373
Uh-huh?

1330
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,072
Take care.

1331
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,130
Because Tulley has taken ill,

1332
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:35,436
I am temporarily putting Scott

1333
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:39,484
in charge of the
B&G presentation.

1334
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,400
So, please afford him
all the respect

1335
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,968
that you would any
senior copywriter.

1336
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,578
Thank you.

1337
01:04:46,665 --> 01:04:48,232
Great.

1338
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,583
People, um, I know that I
speak for Bonnie when ah,

1339
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:54,020
when I say that
we got a good team here.

1340
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:55,892
A strong team.

1341
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,763
A young team.

1342
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:02,376
So, I just wanted to let you
know that I'm here to help.

1343
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,987
My door is always open

1344
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:05,945
for any and all questions
that you may have.

1345
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,077
OK?

1346
01:05:07,164 --> 01:05:08,295
I have a question.

1347
01:05:10,341 --> 01:05:12,038
What happened to your pants?

1348
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:16,086
[employees snickering]

1349
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:17,087
All right then.

1350
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:19,524
Let's get back to work.

1351
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:22,092
The big presentation
is in 15 days.

1352
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:25,834
[thoughtful music]

1353
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:30,752
[Tulley] Writing is always
a challenging discipline.

1354
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,538
Writing with the DT's...

1355
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,410
well, it's more challenging.

1356
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,939
Of course, I did find
something that helped.

1357
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,917
Ricky! I'm home!

1358
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,446
Tulley?

1359
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:16,059
Hey, there you are.

1360
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:21,499
You hungry?

1361
01:06:22,804 --> 01:06:25,459
-No, thanks.
-I got Chinese.

1362
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:26,765
OK.

1363
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:39,517
So you actually like your job?
Adding numbers all day?

1364
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:42,346
Yeah, it's not so bad.
The money's pretty good.

1365
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:46,089
It's not what I plan on doing
for the rest of my life.

1366
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:49,005
-What do you want to do?
-I'd like to write.

1367
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,920
I'd like to write and
actually get paid for it.

1368
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:53,966
And get a house.

1369
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:56,142
Maybe a family.

1370
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:57,709
I heard you were almost married.

1371
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:00,886
Yeah. Almost.

1372
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:02,279
What happened?

1373
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:03,497
I had her killed.

1374
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:07,849
Seriously.
What happened?

1375
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:11,114
I don't know.

1376
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:12,245
Didn't work out.

1377
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:14,595
You ever been married?

1378
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:18,295
No.
Not even close.

1379
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:20,340
I have had hundreds
of kids though.

1380
01:07:20,427 --> 01:07:21,907
Really?

1381
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:23,300
You've managed to keep
your girlish figure.

1382
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:24,388
Yeah, right.

1383
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:28,174
Dammit, Ryan, this is nonsense.
Let me in.

1384
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:29,567
[Tulley] You know,
I'm sorry, it just,

1385
01:07:29,654 --> 01:07:30,698
it just doesn't ring a bell.

1386
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:32,613
What seems to be the trouble?

1387
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,094
[Father] My son.
He's a lunatic!

1388
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:37,183
Are you-are you
Tulley's father?

1389
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:40,752
Unfortunately yeah.
Who are you?

1390
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:41,970
We're friends of his.

1391
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,669
You have my sympathy.

1392
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,540
Ryan!
You gonna let me in or not?

1393
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,107
[Tulley]
You gotta help me out.

1394
01:07:48,194 --> 01:07:49,456
You gotta, you gotta
help me place this.

1395
01:07:49,543 --> 01:07:51,589
Um, where did you say we met?

1396
01:07:51,676 --> 01:07:53,417
Tulley, it's us.
Knock it off.

1397
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:55,636
[Tulley] Levine, come on,
you're spoiling everything.

1398
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:57,551
I almost got rid of him.

1399
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:59,205
Let me take these up.

1400
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,815
-Oh, thanks.
-I'll see if I can talk to him.

1401
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:02,165
It was nice to
meet you, Mr. Tulley.

1402
01:08:03,688 --> 01:08:06,560
If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

1403
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:08,345
is there-is there
anything I can do?

1404
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:11,478
I'm just trying to
get in to see my son.

1405
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:14,525
When I do I'm going to
wring his miserable neck.

1406
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,048
Oh?

1407
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:17,658
I gave him 500 bucks

1408
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:20,008
to get a suit to go to
his sister's wedding.

1409
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,010
And he took it.
And never showed up.

1410
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,491
Then he phoned his mother
and upset her even more

1411
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,841
with some twaddle
about being bed ridden.

1412
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,106
Well, he is very ill, sir.

1413
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:31,629
He won't let me see him.

1414
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:33,674
Makes me stand
out here playing games.

1415
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:36,460
As a matter of fact,

What was that?

1418
01:08:42,683 --> 01:08:46,296
Uh. You know, I'll bet
he would see you if-

1419
01:08:46,383 --> 01:08:48,646
if you'd come back
some other day.

1420
01:08:48,733 --> 01:08:50,256
What, and let him
treat me like this again?

1421
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:52,128
No, thank you.

1422
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:54,173
I just came over here
to give him this.

1423
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:57,655
What, uh...

1424
01:08:57,742 --> 01:08:59,352
More money.

1425
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,573
Money he extorted from
his mother with his lies.

1426
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,837
He's not lying, sir.
He-he really is very ill.

1427
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,667
Do me a favor, will you?

1428
01:09:09,754 --> 01:09:13,105
See if he can put this
money to some good use.

1429
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:14,715
I'm afraid he'll
just drink it up

1430
01:09:14,802 --> 01:09:16,195
like he did all the rest.

1431
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:19,633
-Lean in, sweetie.
-Hello, Mrs. Tulley.

It's a surprise.

you have some kind of a camera.

No.

Not too good.

-Oh.
-I'm glad you're here.

1469
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:41,253
I have some good news.
I spoke to his doctor,

1470
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,863
he's being put on
the eligibility list
