1
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,640
<i>When I say I don't remember that day,
I'm not Iying.</i>

2
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,880
<i>I wish I did, but I just don't.</i>

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,960
<i>It's funny, the stuff that sticks in your head.</i>

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
<i>Stuff you don't think one bit important,</i>

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
<i>not even when it's right there happening.</i>

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,800
<i>Sometimes that's the stuff that sticks.</i>

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,400
<i>Sometimes the most important stuff Goes away.</i>

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,080
<i>It goes away so bad,
it's Iike it was never there to begin with.</i>

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,360
<i>I can't remember that day.</i>

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,040
<i>But I couId teII you forward and backward
about some day when I was five</i>

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,800
<i>and my dad bought me a stupid ice-cream cone.</i>

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,960
<i>I couId teII you the fIavour of the ice cream...</i>

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,200
<i>It was...pink bubbIe gum.</i>

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,240
<i>..and even stuff
about the girl who scooped it out.</i>

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,080
<i>Her hair was fire red,</i>

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,280
<i>red Iike I'd never seen before.</i>

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,520
<i>AII that stuff is there
Iike it was happeninG riGht now, but...</i>

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,520
<i>I don't remember that day.</i>

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,960
<i>At Ieast, not the stuff that they want me to.</i>

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
<i>I remember it was
the first reaIIy hot day of spring.</i>

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,280
<i>I rememBer how the sun feIt
on the back of my neck.</i>

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,720
<i>That's about it.</i>

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>Here 's another one of those things that sticks.</i>

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,120
<i>This one is something
a friend of mine said to me.</i>

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,160
<i>"You have to beIieve that Iife is more
than the sum of its parts, kiddo. "</i>

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,560
<i>I remember it right down to that "kiddo " part.</i>

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,840
<i>But when I think about what she said,
the same thing aIways comes into my head...</i>

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,440
<i>What if you can't put the pieces together
in the first pIace?</i>

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,960
? And this I know, his teeth as white as snow

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,160
? What a gas it was to see him

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
? Walk her every day

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,280
? lnto a shady place

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
? With lips, she said...

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,320
Erm...

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,160
Just hold on one sec.

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,520
? Hey, Paul, hey, Paul, hey, Paul
Let's have a ball...

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,120
- Come in.

38
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,520
How are you, Beck?

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,840
Good.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,880
Yeah, you know, I'm pretty good.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,580
- I'm good. Daddy, how are you?

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,160
<i>Where's Ryan?</i>

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,200
I was telling her the same thing five minutes ago,
Mrs Pollard.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,800
I swear, it's like she doesn't wanna listen to us.

45
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,920
I just don't think I sounded
as good as the other girls.

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,000
Particularly Kate. I mean, Kate's the real singer.

47
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
I think it's a good experience for you.
You've never done one of the musicals.

48
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,720
Yeah, well, this is the first and the last.

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,760
<i>I mean, it's so awkward. You're sitting there
eating soup and, aII of a sudden,</i>

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,800
<i>it's, like, time to sing.</i>

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,440
? I'm eating soup

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,520
? Soup, soupy soup

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,720
You're supposed to make it sound all natural.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,760
I love your voice.

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,800
You'd say that if I sounded like
a harpy with throat cancer.

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,160
- You think it's bad?
- No.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Of course not.

58
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,480
? Stuck here out of gas

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,640
? Out here on the Gaza Strip...

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,240
Damn.

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,200
<i>JuIie PoIIard, Tim WaIIace from the Drama
Department at Iowa. Just checking up on you.</i>

62
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,600
<i>Wondered if we can expect to see you in the faII.</i>

63
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,200
<i>Give me a caII here at the office.
I 'II be in tomorrow.</i>

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
You should call him,
let him know you settled on ASU.

65
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,280
- You did send your confirmation?
- I think I still have a few days.

66
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,960
Oh, Mom, the shop called.
They say you can pick up your car.

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,300
- What's the damage?

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,920
<i>- They didn't say on the machine.
- Oh, that's a great sign!</i>

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,720
Hello?

70
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,840
Slow down, Harry, I can't understand you.

71
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,960
<i>What?</i>

72
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,160
<i>What happened?</i>

73
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,800
No, I'll... I'll be right there.

74
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,360
Lee?

75
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,560
<i>Lee?</i>

76
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,760
Hi, Mommy.

77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,640
<i>Are you aII right?</i>

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,960
Er...

79
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,320
I think I made a mistake.

80
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,160
<i>I can't imagine too many detaiIs
have been reIeased...</i>

81
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
<i>..suspect's here. Do they have any Ieads?</i>

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,720
<i>- Yeah?
- Are you watching the news, chief?</i>

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
Er, yeah, you know I gotta stay
on top of the topical shit.

84
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,520
<i>The TV boys say the suspect is 1 6, some SFK.</i>

85
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,520
<i>Ten bucks says the SFK in question
winds up in your cIass tomorrow.</i>

86
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,320
<i>- Why would he be Special Handling?
- You can get by with a Iot of shit in this world</i>

87
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,680
<i>but you can't stab a retarded kid 20 times
and not be speciaI HandIing.</i>

88
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,320
20 times?

89
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,040
<i>It wouId be OK if it were onIy 1 9?</i>

90
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,320
<i>SFK. chief.</i>

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,880
Sick Fucking Kid.

92
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,160
Do you get music on that?

93
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,640
What?

94
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,320
Do you have a normal radio in here for music?

95
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,880
I was just thinking that when you're parked
somewhere waiting for a guy to speed,

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,320
you'd want some music to help pass the time.

97
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,520
<i>He didn't do this.</i>

98
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,560
I only need to see him for a minute.

99
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
Please.

100
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,000
<i>Visiting days are every second Sunday
ofthe month. noon to four.

101
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,840
Please, please...

102
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,880
One minute.

103
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,960
Just one minute, please.

104
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,000
Please, sir, one minute.

105
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,920
Right, there's nothing I can do,
so I need you to turn around.

106
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,440
<i>..apprehended the aIIeged suspect

108
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,360
<i>Did you do it?</i>

109
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,320
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do it, Leland?

110
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Because of the sadness.

111
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
<i>What sadness?</i>

112
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,760
<i>Whose sadness?</i>

113
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
<i>Your sadness.</i>

114
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,320

<i>- Briefcase?
- Briefcase.</i>

120
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
Hi. Good morning.

121
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,080
I was wondering if I could borrow a stamp?

122
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,400
Let me see.

123
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,680
Erm...

124
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm kinda new here,
so I'm not really sure where they keep stuff.

125
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
I blanked on a phone bill. I'm gonna be
in debtor's prison if I don't get it in the mail.

126
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
<i>Getthe biIIs. I understand.</i>

127
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,760
Here we are.

128
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,120
Thanks.

129
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,960
Oh, by the way, I'm Pearl.

130
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,920
Tomorrow's a formality.

131
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
The judge will glance at your file
and send you back here.

132
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,000
After that comes the fitness hearing...

133
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,920
..and then the adjudication.

134
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,880
<i>Work with me, Lee. They're gonna charge you
with first-degree murder.</i>

135
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
<i>If you get shipped off to aduIt court with that,
you're Iooking at the death penaIty.</i>

136
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,160
Or, if you're lucky, life.

137
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,440
Do you have any concept of what life means?

138
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,400
I'm not an idiot, Charlie. It means life in prison.

139
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,240
- Good morning.
- Hey.

140
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,000
What did I tell you, chief?

141
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,440
Newest addition to SH and your very own
pop sheet, Mr Leland P Fitzgerald,

142
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,760
killer of retarded kids.

143
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,800
Kid.

144
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,840
Ben, retarded kid, singular.

145
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,480
You'll never guess who his daddy is.

146
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,520
I'll put 50 bucks on Satan.

147
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,240
Albert Fitzgerald.

148
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,600
- No shit?
- Hey, I was cIose.

149
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,400
- What's wrong with Fitzgerald?
- Let me see...

150
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,960
He's a drunk, a misogynist...

151
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,400
- Cat can write.
- He's despicable.

152
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,280
Despicable? He's a bastard. So what?
You don't judge a writer by his life.

153
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,040
You judge him by his work.
A different moral standard going on here.

154
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,760
Excuse me, ma'am.

155
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,080
Could I look at your paper?

156
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,120
Oh, yes, certainly, erm...

157
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,120
Business or Life?

158
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Oh, no, I'll wait for the front page, thank you.

159
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,800
Excuse me.

160
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
<i>I'm sorry if I'm bothering you, but...</i>

161
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
<i>aren't you an actor?</i>

162
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,080
<i>- Aren't we all, dear?
- No, no.</i>

163
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,680
I mean, a famous actor.

164
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,360
You know, a movie star actor.

165
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,640
<i>I know your face.</i>

166
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,840
I was in Stanley Kubrick's musical,
the one about the alcoholic pirates.

167
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,040
I played Captain Morgan.

168
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,600
<i>Whenever you're done with the front page, dear.</i>

169
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,160
How about hooking us up with a table
right by the kitchen, dog?

170
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,400
What you in for, dog?

171
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,720
Hey, I'm not asking you cos I'm gonna
kick your ass if you did some fucked-up shit,

172
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,400
cos I already know you did some fucked-up shit.

173
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
Hey, a guy like me,

174
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,720
you know he's an SH cos he ratted out
some bitch from State Street.

175
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Now half the pop wants to stick
a fucking pencil to his eye.

176
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,120
Hey, but white boys ain't about
that gang shit though, huh?

177
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,040
Especially not white boys like you
who don't look like no Slim Shady.

178
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,560
White boys like you the ones
who did some fucked-up shit, huh?

179
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,800
That's cool, dog.

180
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,920
OK, everybody, take your seats, please.

181
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,680
You'll have to forgive Mr Madison today.
He's moving kinda slow.

182
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,280
- His head's beating like it's the end of the world.
- You been drinking that cheap ass burgundy.

183
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,080
- No comment.
- That stuff'll make you go blind, sir.

184
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,760
<i>Hey, three bucks, two Iitres.</i>

185
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,800
I couldn't pass it up.

186
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,040
You, sir, are new to my class.

187
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,280
- What's your name?
- Fitzgerald. Leland P Fitzgerald.

188
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,840
Well, Mr Leland P Fitzgerald,
my name is Pearl Madison.

189
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,800
And I'm gonna be your history teacher,
your science teacher, your math teacher,

190
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,400
your anything else teacher all rolled into one
for however long you'll be here with us.

191
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>Hey, PearIy,</i>

192
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,280
<i>when are you bringing
your dancer up here, dog?</i>

193
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,840
As soon as the lovely Miranda returns from LA,

194
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,280
I'm sure she would be delighted
to meet you hoodlums.

195
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,400
<i>Liar.</i>

196
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,640
Hey, Mrs Pollard.

197
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,720
- Have you been up all night?
- Yes, I suppose I have.

198
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,560
Need a light there?

199
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,600
I...don't feel so bad.

200
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,920
I thought you quit, too.

201
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,200
How could he have been
that much to someone?

202
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,800
How could he mean enough
for that boy to hurt him?

203
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,840
He was barely there.

204
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,520
Mrs Pollard, I really don't know what to say.

205
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,560
Um...

206
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,680
But I just want you to know

207
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,040
that if there's anything that I can do,

208
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,480
just tell me.

209
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,520
It's all right, sweetheart.

210
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,520
<i>And as you Iook out over Venice today,
you see the city...</i>

211
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,520
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, in Venice, there's no streets, right?</i>

212
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,560
<i>There 's just rivers and shit?</i>

213
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,400
Er, canals and shit, yeah.

214
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,720
They don't even allow cars on the island.

215
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,640
<i>You can hear footsteps.
- What's that?</i>

216
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,240
Since they don't allow cars, when you're walking
around, all you can hear is footsteps.

217
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,920
Pearly, help me out here, bro.

218
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,240
I'm developing this theory, right,
that the suicide rate ofVenice is real low.

219
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,200
Cos if you jump off a building, all your ass is
gonna do is splash in a canal and shit, right?

220
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,320
OK, well, why don't we expand
on that theory tomorrow?

221
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,840
Class dismissed, you guys.
Go ahead and bring your books up to the front.

222
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,000
<i>Hey, where were you, B?</i>

223
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
I was kinda wondering...

224
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,040
Maybe I could keep this
and do some writing in my room?

225
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,960
Unfortunately, I can't allow you
to take anything out.

226
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,000
But I'll keep it up here safe for you.

227
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,720
Hey, um...I'm jealous.

228
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,400
- When did you go to ltaly?
- My dad lives in Paris.

229
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,880
<i>So sometimes, we traveI together.</i>

230
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,480
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

231
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,280
You're the one that killed that retarded kid, huh?

232
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,160
Was it some kind of devil worship thing?

233
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,200
What did you do to your hand?

234
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,720
I stabbed myself.

235
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,040
If you're going for suicide,
I'd say try the stomach or somethin'.

236
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,240
I just wanted to know what it felt like.

237
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,200
I bet it hurt.

238
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,680
Should've just asked me, devil boy,
I would have saved you some trouble.

239
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,480
The journal goes down the front of your pants,
the pencil goes in your sock.

240
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,400
Thanks.

241
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
I'm just glad to see somebody's writing.

242
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,440
Er, Pearl? Can I ask you a question?

243
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,320
It's about your name.

244
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
You're wondering, why Pearl?

245
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,680
- You like basketball?
- Sure.

246
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,320
Well, in the '70s, there was this guy
who played for the Knicks.

247
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,840
His name was Earl Monroe.
His nickname was The Pearl.

248
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,280
- Earl the Pearl?
- Earl the Pearl, right.

249
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,960
Well, my parents were in Queens then.

250
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,040
My mom was a dancer. She hated sports.

251
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,760
But somehow my dad talked her into going
to check out a game at the Garden.

252
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,480
It just turns out that it's Earl the Pearl's night.
Cat went off, dropped 33 points on the Celtics.

253
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,040
After the game, all my mom could do
was talk about how watching him play

254
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,400
was like watching a dance recital,
because he moved like poetry...

255
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,440
Hey! Hey! Break it up!
- Outta my way, man!

256
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,440
Anyway, when I was a kid,

257
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
that was pretty much all the story I got.

258
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,040
But a couple of Christmases ago,
I'm knocking a few back with my dad.

259
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,720
And he embellishes.

260
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,560
He said, after the game,
they went back to Queens.

261
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,600
Well, thankfully,
my dad spared me the details here.

262
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,040
But um...the condom broke.

263
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,360
And nine months later, whoops.

264
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,600
- Here comes Pearl.
- Here comes Pearl.

265
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,720
Trust me, the sock.

266
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,880
<i>I know what they want from me.</i>

267
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,560
<i>They want a why.</i>

268
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,160
<i>They want a reason, something to tie up
with a IittIe Bow and bury in the back yard.</i>

269
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,920
<i>Bury it down so deep, it's Iike it never happened.</i>

270
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,680
<i>They want me to say how I'm so sorry</i>

271
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,720
<i>and it was my mom's fauIt</i>

272
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,760
<i>or maybe it was my dad's fauIt,</i>

273
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,200
<i>or it happened because of TV or movies or...</i>

274
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,280
<i>some junk Iike that.</i>

275
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,240
<i>Or maybe I bIame some girI.</i>

276
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,360
<i>Not even when you were a IittIe kid?</i>

277
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,360
You never thought about
whether there was angels or not?

278
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,120
Maybe when I was a little kid.

279
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,560
My grandmother died when I was real little.

280
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,600
And after that, every time...

281
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,320
I stole candy or fought with my mom or...

282
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,960
..played with myself or something,

283
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,720
I'd get this real bad feeling.

284
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,880
I'd picture her from up high with this big frown
on her face, looking down on me.

285
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,160
I don't think that they frown on us.

286
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,720
I think that...

287
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,760
they look after us.

288
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,360
You know, like guardian angels.

289
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,040
They take care of us, make sure...

290
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,520
..make sure nothing bad happens,
make sure everything's OK.

291
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,640
Well, how come everything's not OK
most of the time?

292
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,960
Well, maybe they're lazy.

293
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,360
What?

294
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,160
No, it's just kind of funny, lazy angels.

295
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,560
It makes me think of these big, fat guys
with wings, drinking beer and playing darts.

296
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,600
I want you to be my guardian angel, Lee.

297
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,920
I want you to float over me,

298
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,960
make sure that...

299
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,080
..everything's gonna be OK.

300
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,120
Your hair smells like...

301
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,160
strawberries.

302
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,520
It's my shampoo, dodo, it's not my hair.

303
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,400
- Well, I still like it.
- Look at me.

304
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,480
I'm serious, OK?

305
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,480
I want you to say
that you're always gonna be there.

306
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,520
Sometimes I'm somewhere else.

307
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,040
Just tell me that everything's...

308
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,120
gonna be OK.

309
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,960
Well, I can't really make sure everything's OK.

310
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,440
I know, but...

311
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,760
Sometimes you say things that aren't...

312
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,560
totally true.

313
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,640
But you say them anyways because...

314
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,440
..you want it to be true, you know, maybe...
maybe that's good enough.

315
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,400
Just...

316
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,680
Just tell me everything's gonna be OK.

317
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,960
Why don't you whisper it in my ear, soft?

318
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,680
Everything's gonna be OK.

319
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,400
<i>Yeah, weII...</i>

320
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,960
if they extend the run, you gotta stay, right?

321
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,160
Course you gotta stay. I recognise that.

322
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm not thrilled about it, but you know...

323
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,560
I recognise it.

324
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,840
It's water, Miranda.

325
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,880
No, it is, it's water.

326
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,040
Listen.

327
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,760
Ah! Sweet H2O.

328
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
Yeah.

329
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,440
No, it's fine. The writing's going fine.

330
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,160
The truth? OK.

331
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,440
Um...

332
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,480
The truth is,

333
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,320
whenever I sit down to write,

334
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,280
I think I'm coming out of the gate
with something fresh and...

335
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,960
it winds up being a different spin on Boneyard.

336
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,040
I've basically been rewriting
the same story for three years

337
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,440
and I still can't get the damn thing published.

338
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,920
Thanks, honey.

339
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,120
No, I appreciate it, but you're not really a writer
unless people are reading your shit.

340
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,160
So, Miranda, look...

341
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,280
I'm excited for you, really.

342
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,960
I am.

343
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,520
I'm fired up about all this.
I love that it's going so well for you.

344
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,040
This might be that big break
you've been looking for.

345
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,160
When that comes along, you've gotta
tear into that shit like a rabid dog.

346
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,240
I recognise that.

347
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,840
It'd just be a lot easier if you were here.

348
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,880
<i>..FitzgeraId's arrest.
Why did you do it?</i>

349
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,360
<i>Any connection
between the two teens is uncIear.</i>

350
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,400
<i>We 'II have more news right after this.</i>

351
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,320
<i>Nobody enjoys shopping
for auto insurance.</i>

352
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,920
<i>but try and do it when you've had
three speeding tickets.</i>

353
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,960
<i>Or an accident.</i>

354
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,560
I recall when our lives were unusual and electric,

355
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,600
when we burned with something close to fire.

356
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,440
But now, we sway to a different rhythm.

357
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,280
Lives lived without meaning
or even directed hope.

358
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,360
The passage of time measured only by loss.

359
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,480
Loss of a job,

360
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,360
Ioss of a minivan...

361
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,440
..a son.

362
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,920
Hi, Beth.

363
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,680
<i>Are you OK?</i>

364
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,240
What?

365
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,680
Sorry, what did you say?

366
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,160
I asked if you were OK.

367
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah. Am l... Am I OK about that guy, right?

368
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,320
Kinda seemed like he was bothering you.

369
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,800
That's OK. Er...it happens all the time.

370
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,000
I think it's the uniform.

371
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,600
<i>I have to wear it atthis schooI that I go to.</i>

372
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,200
And it's supposed to be really plain. The whole
point of wearing it is so you don't stand out.

373
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,040
<i>I think aII it reaIIy does
is turn on horny oId guys.</i>

374
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,080
Is it a Catholic school?

375
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,320
No, it's pretty much the opposite.

376
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
It's for people who messed up.

377
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,160
Messed up in what way?

378
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
All kinds of ways, different ways.

379
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,760
<i>Well, what way did you mess up?</i>

380
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,400
Did you really come over here
to ask me about my screwed-up life?

381
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,960
No, I came over here cos...

382
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,080
I thought that guy was bothering you.

383
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,720
And because I think you're really pretty.

384
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,360
People don't really say pretty any more.

385
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,480
They say stuff...

386
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,760
You know, girls or whatever, they say...

387
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,280
..stuff is beautiful or cute but...

388
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,920
..I like pretty, I like the way it sounds.

389
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,960
<i>It's...</i>

390
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,840
<i>It's a cooI word.</i>

391
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,600
Thanks for calling me pretty.

392
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
I'm Leland.

393
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,200
Leland P Fitzgerald.

394
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Becky.

395
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,560
Becky Pollard.

396
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>I don't bIame Becky.</i>

397
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,400
<i>I guess I'm supposed to be upset
about what happened with her.</i>

398
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,480
<i>I'm supposed to cry and aII thatjunk.</i>

399
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,240
<i>But I'm pretty sure I've cried aII the tears I had
out of me by now.</i>

400
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,560
<i>The Iast time I cried was Grandma's funeraI.</i>

401
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,880
<i>Here's another one of those things that sticks.</i>

402
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,000
<i>I remember this other kid.</i>

403
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,040
<i>Some cousin of mine or something.</i>

404
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,880
<i>He was sitting there reaI poIite
with his hands foIded up in his Iap.</i>

405
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,880
<i>I figured that was the way you were supposed
to be. I didn't want that kid to see me crying.</i>

406
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,640
<i>But the tears came, anyway.</i>

407
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,760
<i>That's when I figured out that tears couIdn't
make someone who was dead aIive again.</i>

408
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,320
? We were given some time...

409
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,640
<i>There's another thing to Iearn about tears.</i>

410
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,160
<i>They can't make somebody who doesn't
Iove you any more Iove you again.</i>

411
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,880
<i>Uh-huh?
- It's me, it's Beck.</i>

412
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,360
<i>It's the same thing with prayers.</i>

413
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,960
<i>I wonder how much of their Iives peopIe waste,
crying and praying to God,</i>

414
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,800
<i>trying to make things that happened unhappen.</i>

415
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,080
<i>If you ask me,
the deviI makes more sense than God does.</i>

416
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,000
<i>I can at Ieast see
why peopIe wouId want him around.</i>

417
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,240
<i>It's good to have somebody to bIame
for the bad stuff they do.</i>

418
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,400
<i>Wha...</i>

419
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,880
<i>What's wrong?</i>

420
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,840
<i>Nothing. I sh...</i>

421
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,080
It's just that this is going kinda fast.

422
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,280
I'm not saying that's bad...or anything.

423
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,120
This just isn't normally how I operate.

424
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,240
Oh.

425
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,440
Particularly not with somebody from work.

426
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,320
Well, how long does it normally take you
to seduce one of your co-workers?

427
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,120
I didn't seduce you.

428
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,320
- No?
- No.

429
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,960
Oh, come on. You're beautiful.

430
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,240
You're beyond that.

431
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,400
You have no idea how beautiful you are.

432
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,680
You're deadly.

433
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,960
You're deadly.

434
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,840
I'm powerless before you.

435
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,920
- You hanging out for a while?

436
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,560
I'm staying.

437
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,160
Cool.

438
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,200
That's cool, you know.

439
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,240
That makes me happy.

440
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,840
Cos...

441
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,880
I kinda wanted to kiss you.

442
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,640
? I had no light to follow...

443
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
I wanna kiss you real bad, to say it right.

444
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,320
So can I kiss you?

445
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,720
? I tell you how, three days I tried

446
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,280
? To wake me up

447
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,160
? Oh, but no

448
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,960
? My flesh had turned to snow

449
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,280
? And I thought I had died...

450
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,320
I missed you.

451
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,200
- I always miss you.
? I have seen the face of God

452
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,240
? And I was not afraid

453
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,560
? I have seen the face of God

454
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,880
- So you're a writer?
- Well...

455
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,560
You're not really a writer
unless people are reading your shit.

456
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,600
I'm an aspiring writer.

457
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,520
What do you write about?

458
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,800
Did you hear about that kid?

459
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,280
The one who stabbed that retarded kid?

460
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,280
Yeah.

461
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm gonna write about him.

462
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,320
I'm gonna write a book
about Leland P Fitzgerald.

463
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,160
<i>Maybe God's there because
peopIe get scared of aII the bad stuff they do.</i>

464
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,200
<i>They fiGure that God and the DeviI are aIways
pIaying this tug-o '-war game with them.</i>

465
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,600
<i>And they never know
which side they're gonna wind up on.</i>

466
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,000
Boo!

467
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,560
You know, you're a real goofball sometimes.

468
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,520
Hey, speaking of goofballs...

469
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,640
Um, this is my little brother, Ryan.

470
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,680
Sing a song.

471
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,240
- Bye-bye, Ryan. See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.

472
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,360
It's nice... nice to meet you.

473
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,400
Sing a song!

474
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,320
It's about all he says, but watch.

475
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,000
? l-l-l-ltsy-bitsy spider

476
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,920
No, no!

477
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,160
As soon as you start singing,
he gets all mad at you.

478
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,640
You don't really know what you want,
do you, goofy?

479
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,720
<i>I guess that tug-o'-war idea
expIains how sometimes...</i>

480
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,240
<i>I mean, when peopIe try to do something good,</i>

481
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,280
<i>it stiII turns out bad.</i>

482
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,120
Don't use that "young lives" BS on me, Madison.

483
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,240
Why does this minor deserve
special consideration?

484
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,920
I recognise you're wanting to preserve
the whole "treat everybody equal" thing.

485
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,640
But this kid is different.

486
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,560
You can't deny that.

487
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,240
We've never seen a case like this before.
Nobody has.

488
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,240
The answer is, and will remain in perpetuity, no.

489
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,080
<i>I wiII not have you meeting with any minor
outside the cIassroom.</i>

490
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,120
<i>Am I cIear?</i>

491
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,200
Very clear.

492
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,960
So your lawyer, Charlie... It's Charlie, right?

493
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,160
So he explained how all this works? You don't
have to enter a plea or say a word here.

494
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,320
- I'm not gonna enter a plea.
- OK.

495
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,880
I'm just gonna tell them that I did it.

496
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,280
Well, if you do that, then you're gonna get
shuttled out of here in a heartbeat.

497
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,320
I don't wanna lose you yet, man.

498
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,760
I wanna get a chance to know
what the US of L is all about.

499
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,120
<i>I thought you said
your girlfriend was in Los AngeIes?</i>

500
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,280
She is.

501
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,120
Well, how do you explain the smell?

502
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,920
What smell?

503
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,960
The smell of a girl.

504
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,480
Will you at least think about what I said?

505
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,840
Yeah, I think about a lot of things.

506
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,640
Hey!

507
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,720
Hi, Mr Pollard.

508
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm Leland, Becky's friend.

509
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,760
What happened?
- He rode his bike through some branches.

510
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,280
I told him to cut it out but he just kept going.

511
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,560
Hey, buddy, let me just have a look...

512
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,320
If we don't leave in the next ten minutes...
Where's Becky?

513
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,880
<i>- What did he do?
- It's nothing. It's just a torn sleeve.</i>

514
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,240
- Sing a song.
- I'll get him changed.

515
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,240
I don't think he was trying to screw up anything.

516
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,480
It just kinda seemed
like something he had to do.

517
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,160
Well, thanks for making sure he got home.

518
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,840
Oh, well, we've been walking home together
for a while now, so...

519
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,520
<i>Did you see Beckytoday? Did she
mention anything about something coming up?</i>

520
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,960
I waited for her after school
but she didn't show up.

521
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,240
So... I guess she just didn't wanna see me today.

522
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,240
But it's really no big deal for me
to take Ryan home.

523
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,120
Kinda get a bang out of him.

524
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,440
You need a ride home?

525
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,040
Allen's about ready to head out
for baseball practice.

526
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm sure he wouldn't mind giving you a lift.

527
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,120
Well, thanks, Mr Pollard.

528
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,400
<i>Are you going to work?</i>

529
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,960
No.

530
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,720
No, I mean...

531
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,440
..just for a minute, a couple of things.

532
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,560
Why did you do it?

533
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,600
I got it.

534
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,640
<i>Check the door.
- Stop here.</i>

535
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,280
Let's go, kid.

536
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,360
<i>Is that aII, counseI?
- Yes, your Honour.</i>

537
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,280
<i>The minor's Iack of a criminaI record
and the exempIary schooI performance</i>

538
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,080
<i>are irreIevant matters here
due to the severity of the charges.</i>

539
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,160
And I am denying your request that the minor
be remanded into the custody of his mother.

540
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,280
<i>Is there something you'd Iike to add,
young man?</i>

541
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,320
No, Your Honour.

542
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,280
<i>Do you Iive at the PoIIards'?</i>

543
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,440
<i>Yeah, I know what you're thinking.</i>

544
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
<i>- It's a IittIe strange?
- No.</i>

545
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,360
- You don't think it's strange?
- No, it's just not what I was thinking.

546
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,160
<i>I think it's kinda strange sometimes.</i>

547
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,280
My mom died last summer.

548
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,320
<i>A car accident.</i>

549
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,240
<i>My dad's a Iot cIoser with Tanya.</i>

550
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,200
<i>That's my oIder sister.</i>

551
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,840
He's a lot closer with her than me, so it really
wasn't a big deal for him when I moved.

552
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,600
I turn on Goldencrest, right?

553
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,920
Oh, you can just drop me off at school.

554
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,560
<i>Oh, I'm not going another way or anything.
It's reaIIy no big deaI to take you home.</i>

555
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Mr Pollard said you had
a baseball practice or something.

556
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,480
No.

557
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,880
I quit last week.

558
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,320
Why did you quit?

559
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,200
<i>I was pIaying terribIe.
I couIdn't get my head in the game.</i>

560
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,120
And it's been a rough year
with my mom and all, so...

561
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,840
But Julie and I are going to ASU next year.

562
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,000
Maybe I'll walk on there.
You know, things'll be a lot more settled, then.

563
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,600
- Briefcase?
- Briefcase.

564
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,320
Thanks. Appreciate it.

565
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,440
I'm the one going home with play-off tickets.

566
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,360
Game three, down 0-2 to the Spurs?
That ain't much, man.

567
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,320
The Suns never get out of the first round.

568
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,880
I don't know, man, Marbury's hitting his shots,
we play up tempo? Damn fine ball club.

569
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,640
Your lips.

570
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,680
I see this kid got to you, too, huh?

571
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,320
What do you mean?

572
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,160
It's always hard for me to picture these pimply
little mama's boys doing what you know they did.

573
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,360
But this one even more so than the others.
I can't see this kid hurting a fly.

574
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,120
He's definitely fascinating.

575
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,240
Yeah, well, you're the writer. You give it a word.

576
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,080
That's precisely what I plan to do.

577
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, have you ever read Proust?

578
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,040
I know what you want from me.

579
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,040
Yeah?

580
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,000
I just... I just want you
to have somebody to talk to.

581
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,640
It's the same thing they want from the trial.

582
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,680
What's that?

583
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,200
You want a why.

584
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,200
Well, maybe there isn't one. Maybe...

585
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,760
Maybe this is just something that happened.

586
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,600
Excuse me.

587
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,280
<i>- lsn't the game on?
- What game?</i>

588
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,920
Could you please just change the channel?

589
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,480
Yeah.

590
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,360
It's depressing me, too.

591
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,560
I like that title.

592
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,320
<i>It's not supposed to mean
I'm the President or anything.</i>

593
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,880
Mostly it's just a joke.

594
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,160
Well, what do you write about?

595
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,200
I guess, how I see the world.

596
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,320
How do you see the world, Pearl?

597
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,400
Full of possibilities.

598
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,000
I think that good things abound, positive things.
What about you?

599
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,520
There's two ways to see it.

600
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,160
One is like what you said, where life is OK.

601
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,240
Where maybe stuff's wrong
but you just don't see it.

602
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,280
What's the other way?

603
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,600
<i>When you see what's reaIIy there.</i>

604
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,520
The sadness?

605
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,240
He didn't give you any idea
what that might have meant?

606
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,720
He didn't say much.

607
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,640
When I got home,
all he said was that he'd made a mistake.

608
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,160
I saw his hand and I drove him to the hospital.

609
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,960
He didn't make a sound on the drive.

610
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,160
It's always there.

611
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,360
Even when stuff looks good.

612
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
When kids are playing,
couples are kissing and junk.

613
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,920
It's in all of that stuff.
But mostly, people just look right through it.

614
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,800
What's the "it"?

615
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,360
I mean, what don't they see?

616
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,840
Just how everything's always slipping away.

617
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,640
How everyone's always kind of dying inside.

618
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,040
<i>How sad everybody reaIIy is.</i>

619
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,040
And seeing things this way makes you feel sad?

620
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,600
It doesn't make me feel much of anything.

621
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,800
<i>Did you notice anything different about him?</i>

622
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,640
Today?

623
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,600
<i>When he visited.</i>

624
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,640
Nothing unusual.

625
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,840
<i>Ever since he got back this time,</i>

626
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,760
<i>from the moment I picked him up at the airport...</i>

627
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,200
..something wasn't right with him.

628
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,160
I figured maybe the two of you had a fight.

629
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,320
No.

630
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,480
Perhaps he was just upset about that girl.

631
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,160
Sometimes, things don't work out
between people.

632
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,120
And it's nobody's fault.

633
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,840
<i>- That's a very mature approach.
- I don't know.</i>

634
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,160
Well, you tell me. How's your girl?

635
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,560
Miranda? Oh, Miranda's great.

636
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,600
I meant the other girl.

637
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,280
Oh, that's just something that happened.

638
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,760
Would it hurt Miranda if she found out
about this something that happened?

639
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,280
Yeah.

640
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,640
<i>So, why did you do it?</i>

641
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,000
She's not gonna find out.

642
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,680
<i>Does that make it OK?</i>

643
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,960
OK?

644
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,960
Look, Miranda's been gone
for a long time now, OK?

645
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,400
I'm not even really sure where we stand.

646
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,600
And I'm only human, man.

647
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,240
It's funny how people only say that
after they do something bad.

648
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:56,280
You never hear someone say, "I'm only human"
after they rescue a kid from a burning building.

649
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,960
- Thanks for the ride.
- You bet.

650
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,360
Hey, Leland.

651
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,520
There's something I wanted to tell you...

652
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,080
about Becky.

653
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,360
You know the reason
she's in that probation school, right?

654
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,360
She told me she messed up.

655
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,560
You didn't ask how?

656
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,800
I figured she'd tell me if it was important.

657
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,480
It was drug stuff.

658
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,240
Listen, I don't wanna tell you anything
you don't wanna hear.

659
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,880
No, you can tell me.

660
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,520
You can tell me.

661
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,000
She kind of fell in with this guy,

662
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,200
this older guy, Kevin.

663
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,440
I don't know, he's, like, 20.

664
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,040
<i>He's a drug deaIer.</i>

665
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,760
<i>She ran away with him for a whiIe Iast year.</i>

666
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,720
<i>It got reaIIy, reaIIy messy.</i>

667
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,440
Mrs Pollard had to go pull her out of there.

668
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,400
<i>- But...
- What?</i>

669
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,600
<i>Kevin got out of jaiI today.</i>

670
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,440
Mrs Pollard.

671
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,840
The receipt will take a minute
so I'll go ahead and bring her round.

672
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,520
What's the damage?

673
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,720
I didn't even look. I just signed.

674
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,520
<i>- What's today? The date today?
- It's the 24th.</i>

675
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,480
Julie is running up against the ASU deadline.

676
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,440
- You sent yours in, didn't you?
- Yeah.

677
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,440
Yeah, I don't know, erm...

678
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,000
Maybe...

679
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,160
<i>Maybe she's stiII not sure, you know.</i>

680
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,400
I don't know.

681
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,440
Maybe she just wants to make sure
it's the best place for her.

682
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,120
<i>I saw you the other night,
the way you were hoIding her,</i>

683
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,920
<i>the way you Iook at her even when she's asIeep.</i>

684
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,360
T ake care of Julie for me.

685
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,160
I can't lose her, too. She's all I have left.

686
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,680
Look at that sunshine.
I don't even remember what it feels like.

687
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,400
What did you do to get in here?

688
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,360
Wrong place, wrong time.

689
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,560
That's against the law?

690
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,520
If you're a 1 7-year-old black dude
with an old-school Dr J 'fro, it is.

691
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,280
See you in class, devil boy.

692
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,600
Long live Satan.

693
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,720
<i>Hey, pick up.</i>

694
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,040
<i>I know you're sitting there with a bottIe of wine
watching basketbaII.</i>

695
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,880
<i>I can see you.</i>

696
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,840
<i>Er, OK, fine.</i>

697
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,080
<i>Um...</i>

698
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,800
<i>I miss you and I wanna see you again aIready.</i>

699
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,640
<i>I was thinkinG, you know, since I 'm stuck here,</i>

700
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,240
<i>maybe you couId come up and visit.</i>

701
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,360
<i>I know it wasn't part of the pIan but...</i>

702
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,600
<i>AII right, couId you check
on the name Martin AngIe?</i>

703
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,160
<i>OK, er...one second.</i>

704
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,480
Could you check David Stith? S-T-l-T-H.

705
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,280
<i>I'm sory, there 's just one more.
EdGar Pinkerton.</i>

706
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,240
You do? OK, could you tell me
the room number that Mr...

707
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,480
No, OK, that's fine. That's fine.

708
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,360
Is there a bar in the hotel?

709
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,800
<i>Hi.</i>

710
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,160
Er, excuse me?

711
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
They won't let me get a pitcher if I'm alone

712
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,320
so I was wondering if I could say
that I'm drinking with you?

713
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,720
Fiction or non?

714
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,680
Fiction.

715
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,880
Yeah, you can sit down if you want,
but you should have checked at the bar first.

716
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,960
<i>- They don't have anything on tap here.
- Ah.</i>

717
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,120
<i>- Drink?
- Please, thank you.</i>

718
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,920
I'm sorry to be intruding like this.

719
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,720
<i>But I'm a big fan.
I've read everything you've ever written.</i>

720
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,520
Evidently, Edgar Falling included.

721
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,080
And now that you've read my work, you know
I'm not a fag so I don't wanna fuck you,

722
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,520
and you've probably heard
that I'm an asshole, so...

723
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,360
I'm not going to read your passionate
semi-autobiographical first novel

724
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,440
and pass it on to my agent.

725
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,920
I work at the juvenile hall
where Leland's being detained.

726
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,600
How's he holding up?

727
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,240
He's fine.

728
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,040
Well, no, he's in Special Handling,
so he's isolated now.

729
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,640
<i>Can you get me in to see him?</i>

730
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,440
Oh, I don't have that kinda juice.
I'm just a teacher there.

731
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,080
Visiting day's next Sunday if you wanna...

732
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,200
You don't think I'm aware of that?

733
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,280
<i>Did he do it?</i>

734
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,280
I'm not really allowed to talk about that
outside the facility.

735
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,480
Perhaps he told you something?

736
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,680
Yeah.

737
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,440
<i>yeah, he says he did it.</i>

738
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,240
But I don't know why.
I don't think he knows why, either.

739
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,480
You know your son, he's very detached.

740
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,280
Most of the time, he seems
completely disinterested in his own fate.

741
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,320
Uninterested in his own fate?

742
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,720
Look, if you think I'm gonna be able to provide
some insight into Leland, you're wrong.

743
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,000
<i>There are no private spaces in my son's heart
reserved for me. There never have been.</i>

744
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,040
You moved to Paris...

745
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,080
America's Too Loud, that was what? '94, '95?

746
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,640
So Leland was...?

747
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,840
Chronologies have never been my strong suit.

748
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,320
Well, was he angry with you for leaving,
for moving away?

749
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,120
I'm not really that adept at gauging
people's emotional reactions to events.

750
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,000
I disagree. I've read your books.

751
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,600
Mmm, so have l.

752
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,640
They haven't helped.

753
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,080
Well, he still visits you out there, right?

754
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,160
He said he gets out there
a couple of times a year, so...

755
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,120
What are your visits like?

756
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,360
Chapter Two, right?

757
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm sorry?

758
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,440
<i>Fiction.</i>

759
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,080
<i>You're not here out of some seIfIess devotion
to my son or your admiration for my work.</i>

760
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,640
<i>you're here because you smeII a good book.</i>

761
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,720
<i>And I'm Chapter Two.</i>

762
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,880
I wanna write about your son.

763
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,840
But I don't wanna exploit him.

764
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,880
There's no distinction.

765
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,680
Good luck with your novel.

766
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,520
Maybe I'll pick it up in the supermarket
checkout line one of these days.

767
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,560
Well, the truth is,
I haven't actually seen my dad since I was six.

768
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,080
I don't understand,
I thought you travelled with him?

769
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,280
Well...

770
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,200
He's sent me plane tickets,
one in the spring, one in the winter,

771
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,880
every year since I was 1 2.

772
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,920
But you never went to Paris?

773
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,240
I never really talked to my dad after he left.

774
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,640
Sometimes he'd send me money
for my birthday, junk like that.

775
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,400
One year, he just decided he wanted me
to come visit him for Christmas.

776
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,280
<i>But I had to fIy to New York first,
then catch a pIane to Paris.</i>

777
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,520
<i>Once I got there, though,</i>

778
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,880
<i>I just kinda decided to stay in New York.</i>

779
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,840
<i>I toId my dad about how there was
this sort of eIectricity in the air there</i>

780
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,920
<i>and how I wanted to stay.</i>

781
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,960
<i>He was OK with it.</i>

782
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,560
<i>He even said something Iike
I was a reaI neat kid for doing it.</i>

783
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,960
<i>Once I got there, I couIdn't find a hoteI.</i>

784
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,440
<i>No-one wouId give me a room.
They were aII so worried to give a kid a room.</i>

785
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,640
<i>But it didn't seem to bother them to send
that same kid onto the street with no pIace to go.</i>

786
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,240
<i>So I decided to hide out for a whiIe.</i>

787
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,240
<i>And I found this movie theatre.</i>

788
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,920
<i>And after the first movie,
this famiIy came and sat down next to me.</i>

789
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,000
<i>And the dad, I guess he noticed
the two big duffeI bags that I had next to me.</i>

790
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,600
<i>He made some corny joke
about whether I was staying for a whiIe.</i>

791
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,200
<i>I toId him how I came to be in New York.</i>

792
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,160
<i>That got the mom's attention.</i>

793
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,240
<i>Her name 's AngeIa.</i>

794
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,800
<i>But I caIIed her Mrs CaIderon then.</i>

795
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,240
<i>She was worried about me. She said
I couId come stay with them for the hoIidays.</i>

796
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,880
<i>I said it sounded pretty good.</i>

797
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,640
<i>You couId teII her pIace cost a fortune.</i>

798
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,680
<i>And her daughter...</i>

799
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,960
<i>She was kind of snobby, but OK.</i>

800
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,040
<i>She just kept trying to kiss me,
and I wasn't into it then.</i>

801
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,600
<i>They were aII reaIIy nice to me,
but particuIarIy Mrs CaIderon.</i>

802
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,040
<i>I just Ioved Iooking into her eyes.</i>

803
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,960
It was like they reflected
the electricity of the whole city.

804
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,600
I didn't feel lonely at all when I was around her.

805
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,360
She kinda made me feel like...

806
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,400
<i>everything was OK.</i>

807
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,800
Or like stuff was wrong but you couldn't see it?

808
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,120
When my dad sent me another ticket that spring,

809
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,320
I kinda figured
maybe I'd just go back to New York instead.

810
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,200
But this ticket was for ltaly.

811
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:16,760
And my dad said I should fly to a new place
each time, see the world that way.

812
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,360
It could be our little secret.

813
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,400
Where did you go the last time?

814
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,200
<i>WeII, my dad said I shouId see New York
in the spring.</i>

815
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,640
Did you see the Calderons?

816
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,640
<i>Did something happen?</i>

817
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,040
Well, it's a big city.

818
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,480
Something's always happening in New York.

819
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,000
- What the fuck, dude?
- Where is she?

820
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,040
<i>Where's who? And who are you?</i>

821
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,120
<i>AIIen!</i>

822
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,640
- Come on, let's go.
- Where are we going? Go where?

823
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,600
Here, get dressed.
I'm gonna take you home. Come on.

824
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,160
<i>Look, man...</i>

825
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,440
Hey, listen, OK, I'm not gonna beat you.

826
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,960
But this isn't fucking right. This is my place.

827
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,080
I don't know who the fuck you are.
I just wanna know...

828
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,080
who the fuck you are, OK?

829
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,040
<i>Stop!</i>

830
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,720
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to her family?

831
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,400
<i>Do you care?</i>

832
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,240
<i>- Stop!
- Do you even fucking care?</i>

833
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,840
- Stop kicking him! Stop!
- You're destroying her family!

834
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,360
Stop!

835
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,440
You fucking junkie!

836
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,200
Stupid junkie fuck.

837
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,680
<i>I don't think I know
what the definition of Iove is.</i>

838
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,600
<i>You know in your heart
if you Iove somebody.</i>

839
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,320
<i>But it's not in your heart.</i>

840
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,360
<i>Love's on your tongue.</i>

841
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,400
<i>It's a word, that's aII.</i>

842
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,400
OK, did you tell Becky you loved her?

843
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,640
<i>She said she Ioved you?</i>

844
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,000
But she still broke up with you, right?

845
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,040
<i>I'm not angry with her.</i>

846
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,200
<i>I was never angry with her.</i>

847
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,280
It's OK to be angry.
I mean, you're practically entitled to it.

848
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,440
Why?

849
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,040
<i>You're onIy human.</i>

850
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,080
I mean, you are human, aren't you?

851
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Well, if you say so, Pearl.

852
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,400
Thank you for what you did today.

853
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,080
I think we should talk.

854
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,720
I know that this doesn't seem
like the best time, but...

855
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,760
Julie, I found that letter.

856
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,000
I found the letter to lowa.

857
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,960
And er...

858
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,400
If you've changed your mind, I understand.

859
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,760
But...why didn't you tell me?

860
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,640
Or ask me or something, you know?

861
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,920
It's OK.

862
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,520
It's OK, because I can go out there with you
and I'll...

863
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,880
I'll apply to school there next semester.

864
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,600
This isn't about where I go to school,
it's about us.

865
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,360
Oh.

866
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,640
OK.

867
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,040
Well, you know what I think.

868
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,240
So...

869
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,960
If you have something to say, you should say it.
Because I don't have anything.

870
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,320
Maybe we shouldn't plan
like we're gonna move off together.

871
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,760
Does that mean what?
Does that mean we're...not going to or...?

872
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,880
I love you, Allen, but...

873
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,240
- But...
- But we've been together for a really long time,

874
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,000
really close,

875
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,760
Iike we're married since you moved in.

876
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,560
- And everything's so set...

877
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,000
Sorry to interrupt, but er...

878
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,880
I wanted us all to talk about tomorrow.

879
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,560
OK, we'll be right there.

880
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,800
I don't know, it just doesn't really feel right
to me any more, and...

881
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,840
Maybe it was just...

882
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,760
too much too soon, you know?

883
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,560
Or that we both changed.

884
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,600
No, I haven't changed.

885
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,160
I haven't changed.

886
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,440
Then I've changed.
And what I want has changed.

887
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,720
I don't want you to go out with me to lowa.

888
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,680
I'm really sorry.

889
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,400
No, wait, Julie!

890
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,520
- Hey, Julie.

891
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,160
Julie.

892
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,880
<i>OK, here's the definition.</i>

893
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,440
<i>Love is when you can't get somebody
out of your mind,</i>

894
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,800
<i>when they're your first thought in the morning
and your Iast thought at night.</i>

895
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,560
<i>Maybe it's not in your heart,
but it is in your head.</i>

896
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:15,960
OK.

897
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,360
<i>So, do you think about Becky?</i>

898
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,880
All the time.

899
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,760
You don't have anything to worry about,
I promise.

900
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,680
If you have to wake me up
in the middle of the night

901
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,960
to tell me that I don't have
anything to worry about,

902
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,480
it kinda makes it seem like
I do have something to worry about.

903
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,240
I just wanted to see a familiar face.

904
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,080
I just wanted someone to talk to.

905
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,240
Talk to at two o'clock in the morning?

906
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,480
Look, I'm really sorry, OK,
I didn't show up today, but...

907
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,200
it just sort of came up, you know, I didn't...

908
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,520
Look, you're my guardian angel, right?

909
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,560
I can count on you.

910
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,480
- Do you love this guy?
- No.

911
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,560
You don't have to be afraid to tell me the truth.

912
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,160
I don't know.

913
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,120
You don't know?

914
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,160
No. I...

915
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,920
Look, I'm sorry, OK? I just...

916
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,960
I'm confused and I don't...

917
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,960
I don't really mean...

918
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,480
Maybe we shouldn't talk.
We should talk tomorrow, you know?

919
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,960
It's just I really wanted to see you
because you're so good to me.

920
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,080
But that's not enough.

921
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,240
No, it's not like that.

922
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,400
Please.

923
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,160
I need you, OK?

924
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,240
I need you really badly.

925
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,640
You don't have anything
to worry about, OK? Just...trust me.

926
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,080
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

927
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,120
Is everything OK?

928
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,840
Shit!

929
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,320
Shit...

930
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,000
Hello?

931
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,040
I didn't hear the phone ring.

932
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,560
Oh, yeah, erm...

933
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,640
No, he's in the shower. Can l...?

934
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,280
Hello?

935
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,320
- Hello?

936
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,240
Calm down.
If you calm down, I can explain it.

937
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,280
But I can't explain it if...

938
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,560
Mira...

939
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,280
No, I'm not gonna lie to you.

940
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,200
<i>I'm not gonna Iie to you, I wanna taIk.</i>

941
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,440
<i>But I wanna taIk Iike, you know,
two normaI, rationaI...</i>

942
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,320
You know, you've been gone
for three fucking months, OK?

943
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,400
Mira...

944
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,600
If you'd just let me fucking explain.

945
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,040
- Did you fuck her?
- Come on, Leland, come on.

946
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,240
- I just wanna know if you fucked her.
- That's not relevant to what we're doing here.

947
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:51,920
- Well, what are we doing here?
- We're talking.

948
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,480
Mostly, I'm talking.

949
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,520
I'm trying to help you.

950
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,120
Maybe I'm trying to help you.

951
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,400
I'm not the one who did something wrong
to get here.

952
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,520
Just because what I did is wrong
doesn't make what you're doing right.

953
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,400
No, I never said right.
I never made that distinction.

954
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,520
Right.

955
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,920
You only said you were human.

956
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,640
- That explains it.
- OK, I'm a bastard. Does that do it?

957
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,760
- I did it cos I'm a bastard, OK?
- And you wanted to.

958
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,800
I mean, you wanted to fuck that other girl.

959
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,880
Yeah, I wanted to.

960
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,920
I wanted to.

961
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,640
I don't see what's wrong with me asking you that.

962
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,760
Just talking, right?

963
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,160
We went to my place.

964
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,920
And er...

965
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,680
There was a message on the machine
from Miranda.

966
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,840
There was just this earthquake in LA.

967
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,840
And she woke up scared, she was terrified.

968
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,720
And instead of calling her back,

969
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,960
instead of calling my girlfriend back,

970
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,080
I fucked some other chick.

971
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,000
I knew it was wrong but...

972
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,040
..I did it anyway.

973
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,840
<o>you know what the funny thing
about earthquakes is?

974
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:38,000
After an earthquake, you see people pulling
other people out of broken-down buildings,

975
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,440
<i>peopIe hugging and junk,</i>

976
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,520
<i>because they saw a IittIe girl's shoe in the road
and no IittIe girl around.</i>

977
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,920
Then, a couple of days later,
they forget all about it.

978
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,000
It still shows you
that there's goodness in people.

979
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,120
Well, during earthquakes, at least.

980
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,280
People make mistakes.

981
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,560
People are fallible.

982
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,600
We are fallible, Leland.

983
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,440
Even with the best intentions,

984
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,960
most people don't have the inner strength
it takes to do good all the time.

985
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,200
I guess.

986
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,640
Look, what happened with Becky?

987
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,720
I don't blame Becky.
I know you think that's why, but it isn't.

988
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,240
It's not about why.

989
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:23,360
Look, I just hurt somebody.
I feel terrible, I fucked up.

990
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,840
I'd feel better knowing that I'm sitting
with somebody who fucks up, too.

991
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,520
Well, you know what happened.
She broke up with me for that other guy.

992
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,120
<i>I don't wanna hurt you, OK?</i>

993
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,720
So, don't.

994
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,920
<i>Sometimes, things don't work out.
It's nobody's fauIt.</i>

995
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,760
That's bullshit.

996
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,520
That's bullshit!

997
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,480
It's her fault. She lied to you.

998
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,160
- I don't see it that way.
- But, at some point, you did.

999
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,920
I'm sorry, I get...

1000
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,960
confused, you know?

1001
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,840
I'm not like you.

1002
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:00,560
<i>You say it's hurting you, but it doesn't seem
Iike it matters one way or another.</i>

1003
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,640
It matters.

1004
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,440
At some point, you got angry.

1005
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,040
Prove it to me. Show it to me.

1006
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,120
How do I show it?

1007
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,720
You said things and you did things
that it didn't make any sense to say and do.

1008
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,080
It didn't change anything,
but you did them anyway.

1009
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,360
<i>YeII atyou? shouId I scream atyou?</i>

1010
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,000
Hit you?

1011
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:21,480
Is that how I show you it matters?
If I hit you, it matters?

1012
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,520
I love you.

1013
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,200
What else can I say?

1014
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,640
Nothing I say is gonna change anything.

1015
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,840
Cos you love somebody else.

1016
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,640
I didn't like being the kind of person that did that.

1017
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,680
What kind of person?

1018
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,720
Like everybody else?

1019
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,000
I didn't like the way it felt.

1020
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,440
But you liked how it felt
when you were in love with her, right?

1021
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,040
It's all part of the trade-off, man.

1022
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,960
Love's only such a great thing because you
know what it feels like to get your heart broken,

1023
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,080
what it feels like to be alone.

1024
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,240
There was...

1025
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,640
..something I said before,
something that was kind of a lie.

1026
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,680
About what?

1027
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,160
It's about how it doesn't make me
feel much of anything.

1028
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,840
Mostly, I keep it out, but...

1029
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,160
When you can't?

1030
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,840
I don't know.

1031
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,080
It covers my eyes.

1032
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,360
It's just all I can see.

1033
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,080
Say, there's some kids playing baseball.

1034
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,840
All I see is the one kid they won't let play
because he tells corny jokes.

1035
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,840
No-one thinks they're funny.

1036
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,880
Or I see a boy and a girl in love,

1037
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,720
and kissing, you know...

1038
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,280
I just see that they're gonna be
one of those sad, old couples one day,

1039
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,120
<i>who just cheat on each other
and can't even Iook each other in the eye.</i>

1040
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,240
<i>And I feeI it. I feeI aII of their sadness.</i>

1041
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,440
I feel it probably even worse than that sad
old couple or that corny kid will ever feel it.

1042
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,000
<i>Do you feeI Iike that now?</i>

1043
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,760
Well, mostly, I keep it out.

1044
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,440
Did you feel like that
after you fought with Becky?

1045
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,280
I don't know, maybe.

1046
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,080
After you got back from New York?

1047
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:01,800
It doesn't matter.

1048
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,640
Cos telling you about it
and getting you all sad and junk...

1049
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,880
..well, it never changes anything.

1050
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,800
Cos nothing can make
what happened unhappen.

1051
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,200
Excuse me, Mr Pollard, sir?

1052
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,240
Oh, please, this isn't the time.

1053
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,680
We were hoping that you might just...

1054
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,320
<i>I'm asking you as a favour, pIease...</i>

1055
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,920
- Sir, I respect your situation.
- Well, thank you for that.

1056
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,240
- But we were hoping that you might...
- Hoping I might what?

1057
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
Hoping I might what? We're in grief here.

1058
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,200
<i>- How is that a story?
- Harry...</i>

1059
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,240
<i>How is my daughter crying a story?</i>

1060
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,920
<i>We didn't do anything wrong, aII right?</i>

1061
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,480
<i>We just... We Iost a chiId.</i>

1062
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:59,200
And we wanna be left alone.
How difficult is that to understand?

1063
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,880
I apologise.

1064
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,400
If you want a fucking story,
you go talk to that kid's parents.

1065
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,160
Harass them!
Ask them how they raised a monster!

1066
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,520
They're the ones who did something wrong,
not us.

1067
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,880
<i>I'm sorry..</i>

1068
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,080
I want it to be over.

1069
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,000
I know.

1070
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,240
But it's never gonna be over!

1071
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,320
It's never gonna be over.

1072
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,120
You ever think
the whole thing doesn't make sense?

1073
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,720
I mean, they take all this stuff away from you.

1074
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,120
Freedom, girls and sunshine.

1075
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,320
Because it's supposed to make it
so when you get back on the outs,

1076
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,440
you never wanna screw up again.

1077
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,680
All it really does is get you to thinking
that you're so small, you know.

1078
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,880
Like you're this small thing
that doesn't matter for anything.

1079
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,920
By the time you do get out,

1080
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,120
you don't even feel
like a human person any more.

1081
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,800
Damn, devil boy,
they can't even make a lay-up out there.

1082
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,680
It's important to me
that she knows that I didn't know.

1083
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,680
Promise me you'll tell her I didn't know.

1084
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,800
I promise.

1085
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,040
When you get a moment,
Elden wants to see you.

1086
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,200
Look...

1087
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,840
..I know I'm the bastard here, OK?

1088
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,920
That's as close to an apology
as I'm gonna get, isn't it?

1089
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,440
Excuse me.

1090
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,200
Hey, that 2002 finally give up the ghost on you?

1091
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,120
Empty it out.

1092
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,160
Empty out the cash register.

1093
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,080
- Empty it the fuck out, come on!
- Right, OK. Don't, OK?

1094
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,280
It takes a minute, OK?

1095
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,320
It's computer stuff, not me.

1096
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,840
- Hold on.
- Hey, hey!

1097
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,880
Don't move, OK?

1098
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,040
- Cool, man, cool. I ain't moving.
- OK, just don't move.

1099
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,120
- I don't have a bag.
- Hand it to me.

1100
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,200
Give it to me, come on!

1101
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,440
Thank you.

1102
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,400
- What the fuck was that?

1103
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,560
This is bullshit, Elden.
This is red-tape bullshit and you know it.

1104
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,680
No, Madison, this is about you
running your own programme.

1105
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,040
You asked me about this kid, I told you no.

1106
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,240
Then you, in effect, say, "Fuck you, I do
whatever I want. Elden Gilmore be damned."

1107
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,320
- Look, this is about a kid who's so screwed up...
- No, this is about a book.

1108
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,400
And you wanna talk about red-tape bullshit?

1109
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,680
Let's talk about how fast I could have you fired

1110
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,560
for turning your classroom over
to non-certified personnel

1111
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,880
while you went off
to play your 20/20 bit with this kid.

1112
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,200
- Man, I am pulling you from SH.
- Wait a minute...

1113
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,520
After lunch, report to A Wing.

1114
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,640
You're taking over Bellsey's class.

1115
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,160
Hey, Pearl, I was wondering
if you could do us a favour.

1116
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,560
I'm not really in a position
where I can be doing any favours right now.

1117
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:18,200
Cos I was just wondering if we could get some
time on the field to play basketball or something.

1118
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,240
They're pulling me from here.

1119
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,440
They're sending me to another room.

1120
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,200
But you'll be back tomorrow.

1121
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,400
No.

1122
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,200
Oh.

1123
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,600
I'm gonna miss our talks.

1124
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,440
You know, I'm gonna try and get back in here
if I can. I don't know if it'll happen or not.

1125
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:44,320
- It's not my decision. It's not like...
Let's go. Clean it up. Break's over.

1126
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,360
<i>I'm not baiIing on you or anything.</i>

1127
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,920
I didn't get to tell you everything
I wanted to tell you.

1128
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,520
I talk about New York at the end.

1129
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,600
You've finished writing?

1130
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,400
<i>I don't know.</i>

1131
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,560
<i>I want you to read it.</i>

1132
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,800
Maybe there's a why in there somewhere.

1133
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,840
Maybe it'll make sense to you.

1134
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,280
Whether or not it makes sense to me,
it doesn't matter.

1135
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,040
Whatever happened, whatever you were
thinking, that's not the important thing.

1136
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,120
The most important thing right now
is what happens to you, Leland.

1137
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,640
Because you do control that, to some extent.

1138
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,720
Listen to Charlie.

1139
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,760
Listen to your lawyer. Do whatever he tells you
to do. He does know what's best for you.

1140
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,160
What you did was wrong.

1141
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,760
And I know you know that.

1142
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:53,080
I mean, you might not show it in the right way,
but I know you recognise it.

1143
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,640
You can't make it unhappen, but...

1144
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,640
..nobody ever can.

1145
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:05,200
Just because what you did was wrong
doesn't mean that giving up on your life is right.

1146
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,120
<i>Turn around!</i>

1147
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,160
<i>- Turn around!
- Stop right there!</i>

1148
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,640
<i>Go down to the Ground! SIowIy!</i>

1149
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:23,240
- What's going on?
- What is this? What is happening?

1150
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,200
- We're placing your son under arrest.
- He's not my son.

1151
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,640
Allen!

1152
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,320
Allen...

1153
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,520
- Allen...
- Allen, what is this?

1154
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,920
I'm sorry, Mrs Pollard.

1155
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,560
I just wanted to get out of town.
I made a mistake.

1156
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,240
<i>Don't say anything. Don't say another word.</i>

1157
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,280
<i>We'II Get you a Iawyer, sweetheart.</i>

1158
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,360
You ratted me out.

1159
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,800
You told my boss
I was writing a book about Leland.

1160
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,520
I said you were attempting
to write a book about Leland.

1161
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:05,000
Did you think
I was gonna allow you to exploit my son?

1162
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,320
No, I guess not. That's your job, isn't it?

1163
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,360
Excuse me?

1164
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,920
The only reason you're here
is because you smell a book.

1165
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,560
Look, I don't need to prey on a family tragedy
for my material, you vulturous little hack.

1166
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,000
I could write 1 2 novels
on the light and shadow in this bar.

1167
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:24,720
That's what you're compiling your notes about?
The light and shadows in the bar?

1168
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,600
<i>I was trying to heIp him.</i>

1169
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,240
I'm the one here
who actually gives a fuck about your son.

1170
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,960
You've got no right to accuse me
of not caring for my son.

1171
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:37,120
If you cared about your son, you'd have
attempted to see him over the past ten years,

1172
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,880
instead of paying to fly him
everywhere that you aren't.

1173
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,000
My relationship with Leland
is none of your concern.

1174
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,280
Apparently, it's none of your concern, either.

1175
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,760
Look, I'm aware that I have made mistakes
in my life, Mr Madison.

1176
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,800
<i>I am fuIIy aware of that fact.</i>

1177
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,080
<i>But I sure the fuck know how to write my books.</i>

1178
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,280
You're pathetic.

1179
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,360
- That's why you'll never be a writer.
- No, that's why I'm not a bastard.

1180
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,720
Hey, can I come in?

1181
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,360
I just wanted to see if you were OK.

1182
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,040
But I guess you're mad at me.

1183
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,960
But I didn't do anything wrong.

1184
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,000
I didn't...

1185
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,040
I didn't do anything wrong,
except make a lot of mistakes.

1186
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,360
And...

1187
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,280
I know that.

1188
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,160
And I'm sorry.

1189
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,000
But I'm done.

1190
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,160
I'm done with all the mistakes.

1191
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm going back to rehab.

1192
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:37,920
And...

1193
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,080
I'm gonna get clean this time,
because I wanna be clean.

1194
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,320
And I swear...

1195
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,840
I swear I didn't know that Leland was gonna...

1196
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,040
..do anything.

1197
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,840
Just please tell me you don't...

1198
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,880
think that I knew because...

1199
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,440
..if you felt that, I would... I'd wanna die.

1200
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,800
I'd wanna die if you could even think that.

1201
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,080
You know how much I loved Ryan.

1202
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,160
You know how much I loved Ryan.

1203
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,360
- Got it.

1204
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,960
Thanks.

1205
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,400
- Hey.
- Hi.

1206
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,180
<i>- One main canaI known as the Grand CanaI...</i>

1207
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,840
<i>For centuries, there was no bridge
over the Grand CanaI...</i>

1208
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,040
How are you doing?

1209
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,080
<i>- How are you doing?
- All right.</i>

1210
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,520
So, did you escape the wrath?

1211
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,600
Gilmore owes me a couple still.

1212
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,960
You er...got any desire to burn those up?

1213
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,240
Goddamn you, man!

1214
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,600
- Hey, shoot, man!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

1215
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:48,200
When a guy hits three in a row,
you might wanna start guarding him.

1216
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,560
Miranda, don't... No, don't hang up, listen.
Please, please.

1217
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,600
Look, I fucked up.

1218
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,640
OK. I'm...

1219
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,960
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna try and explain what I did.

1220
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:15,800
I know what I did was wrong and
I'm not gonna make excuses about it. I just...

1221
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:18,840
I just want you to know
that I'm really, really sorry.

1222
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,360
And...

1223
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,200
I wanna make this up to you.

1224
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,160
I do, I wanna make this up to you so badly,
I swear.

1225
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:31,120
I'm gonna get on the plane and come out there.

1226
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,680
Because I wanna make this right, you know.

1227
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,840
I wanna make this right between us.

1228
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,320
Cos l...

1229
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,200
I love you.

1230
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,200
I love you very much.

1231
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,360
It's all for you.

1232
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,720
<i>Shit!</i>

1233
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,120
Hey, Allen.

1234
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,720
<i>I think there are two ways
you can see the world.</i>

1235
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,880
<i>You either see the sadness
that's behind everything</i>

1236
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,720
<i>or you choose to keep it aII out.</i>

1237
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,880
<i>Your heart can't break.
if you don't Iet the world touch it.</i>

1238
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,760
<i>I wasn't Iying when I said, "I don't bIame her."</i>

1239
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,560
<i>What happened wasn't her fauIt.</i>

1240
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,080
<i>It was a coupIe of days
after aII that stuff with Becky</i>

1241
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,480
<i>that I got the pIane ticket
to New York from my dad.</i>

1242
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:03,760
<i>I was excited to be back in the city,</i>

1243
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,560
<i>around Mrs CaIderon, too.</i>

1244
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,400
<i>I was kind of hoping
it wouId be Iike the Iast time.</i>

1245
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,440
<i>Iike I couId step back
into being that same kid again,</i>

1246
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,040
<i>but. as soon as I saw her.
I couId teII something was different.</i>

1247
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,160
<i>She was divorced.</i>

1248
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,840
<i>It turns out Mr CaIderon cheated on her
for aImost the whoIe time they were married.</i>

1249
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,680
<i>Mrs CaIderon said
I shouId caII her "AngeIa " now.</i>

1250
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,720
<i>That night, I toId her
aBout what happened with Becky.</i>

1251
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,880
<i>I remember exactIy what she said,
right down to the "kiddo " part.</i>

1252
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,600
It happens at different times for different people,

1253
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,680
but it happens to everybody.

1254
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:54,000
The worst part about growing up...
heartbreak.

1255
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:59,480
Realising that bad things
happen to people like you, too.

1256
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,880
But...

1257
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,520
it's a part of life.

1258
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,160
It seems like a pretty big part.

1259
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:18,560
That's why you have to believe
that life is more than the sum of its parts, kiddo.

1260
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,560
<i>I thought about what she said,
but it didn't make much sense</i>

1261
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,640
<i>and it didn't seem to be working for her,
in the first pIace.</i>

1262
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:31,320
<i>I kind of feIt my heart breaking for her,
but I knew that was no good.</i>

1263
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,760
<i>I wanted to do something for her,
but there wasn't anything.</i>

1264
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:39,120
<i>There wasn't one thing I couId reaIIy do.</i>

1265
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,480
? Open the box

1266
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,520
? What is in there?

1267
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,960
? There are no tears to be wasted

1268
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,920
? How can I climb

1269
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,000
? On a shoulder to cry?

1270
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,480
? If only this night

1271
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,120
? Could just take us away...

1272
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,680
<i>The eIectricity wasn't in her eyes, any more,</i>

1273
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,480
<i>and I started to think
that maybe the reason it wasn't in her eyes</i>

1274
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,520
<i>was because it wasn't there, at aII.</i>

1275
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,040
<i>Her eyes were stiII refIecting what was there,
but now it was the sadness.</i>

1276
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,120
<i>I started to see it everywhere.</i>

1277
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,120
<i>Every face was different, but the same.</i>

1278
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,160
<i>I saw the sadness in every singIe one.</i>

1279
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,840
<i>I feIt my heart break, over and over,
and each time Iike the first time.</i>

1280
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:34,240
<i>I even saw it in my mom's face.</i>

1281
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,760
<i>I saw how much my dad had hurt her
and I saw how IoneIy she was</i>

1282
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,880
and how much she wanted me to be happy.

1283
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,160
<i>It's the same with every parent.</i>

1284
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,720
<i>They want their kids to be happy, but they
shouId know it aIways turns out the same.</i>

1285
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:51,400
<i>I don't know why, but I started to see it in Ryan
worse than anybody.</i>

1286
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,200
<i>The first day after I got back,
he was waiting for Becky,</i>

1287
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,960
<i>but she didn't show up, so I waIked him home.</i>

1288
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,360
<i>The next day, I went to his cIass.</i>

1289
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,200
<i>AII the words they were teaching him
were things to stay away from.</i>

1290
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,200
<i>There weren't any words
Iike "strawberry." or "kiss".</i>

1291
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,080
<i>You couId teII he reaIIy Iiked
this girI who worked there,</i>

1292
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,320
<i>but she just smiIed at him, Iike you do at a baby
when they do something cute.</i>

1293
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,320
<i>I started to think that he knew.</i>

1294
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,520
<i>He knew that, no matter what he did,</i>

1295
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,160
<i>he was never gonna be a kid
with a girl Iike that on his arm.</i>

1296
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:37,160
<i>He knew everything.</i>

1297
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,560
<i>He knew that nobody Iooked at him
Iike a normaI kid.</i>

1298
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,480
<i>PeopIe either Iaughed at him
or feIt sorry for him.</i>

1299
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,440
<i>He knew it aII,
but he couIdn't do anything about it.</i>

1300
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,080
<i>He was trapped.</i>

1301
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,920
<i>I couIdn't sIeep. I hadn't sIept since New York.</i>

1302
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,040
<i>I was Iying there and I 'd think about
Mrs CaIderon and I 'd think about Ryan</i>

1303
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,040
<i>and I feIt things tight in my chest.</i>

1304
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,840
<i>I feIt Iike I was drowning.</i>

1305
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,480
<i>There 's aII this sadness
and there 's nothing you can do about it</i>

1306
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,520
<i>and aII I wanted was for it to go away.</i>

1307
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,840
<i>When I say, "I don't remember that day",
I'm not Iying.</i>

1308
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,720
<i>I wish I couId remember, but I don't.</i>

1309
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,040
<i>At Ieast, not the stuff they want me to.</i>

1310
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:32,880
<i>- Christ Jesus.
Oh. God.</i>

1311
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,440
<i>It's over.</i>

1312
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,160
It's over now.

1313
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,200
<i>Maybe it makes sense now.</i>

1314
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,000
<i>Maybe somewhere in aII of this,
there is a reason.</i>

1315
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,200
<i>Maybe somewhere in aII of this, there is a why.</i>

1316
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,480
<i>Maybe somewhere there 's that thing</i>

1317
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,040
<i>that Iets you tie it aII up with a neat bow
and bury it in the back yard.</i>

1318
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:10,880
<i>Bury it down so deep, it's Iike it never happened.</i>

1319
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,440
<i>But nothing.</i>

1320
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,240
<i>Not a why, not getting angry,
not saying you're sorry.,</i>

1321
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,040
<i>not prayers and not tears.</i>

1322
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,320
<i>Nothing can make something that happened
unhappen.</i>

1323
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,840
<i>You can't make it unhappen,
but nobody ever can.</i>

1324
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:39,320
Just because what you did was wrong,

1325
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,280
it doesn't mean that giving up on your life
is right.

1326
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,240
You know I'm sorry, don't you, Pearl?

1327
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,080
<i>I do. I know you are.</i>

1328
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,520
It doesn't change anything,

1329
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,160
but I'm sorry.

1330
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:15,720
<i>The worst part is knowing
that there is goodness in peopIe.</i>

1331
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,880
<i>MostIy, it stays deep down and buried.</i>

1332
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,000
<i>Maybe we don't have God
because we 're scared of the bad stuff.</i>

1333
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,520
<i>Maybe we 're reaIIy scared of the good stuff.</i>

1334
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,000
<i>Because, if there 's no God,</i>

1335
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:41,160
<i>that means it's inside of us
and we couId be good aII the time, if we wanted.</i>

1336
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,720
<i>So, when we do bad things,
it'd Be because we want to</i>

1337
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,760
<i>or because we have to.</i>

1338
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:55,040
<i>Or maybe we just need the bad stuff to remind
us what the good stuff is in the first pIace.</i>

1339
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,960
What are you doing, you goofball?

1340
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,400
<i>Just go around.</i>

1341
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,560
Uh...

1342
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:20,640
Come here.

1343
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,080
Come here.

1344
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,800
Everything's OK.

1345
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,760
Everything's gonna be OK.

1346
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,360
I promise.

1347
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:58,160
? Don't go racing

1348
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:02,200
? When you're on your own

1349
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:08,360
? Feet down and raining

1350
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:14,680
? See the jewel flow

1351
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:20,600
? Now that the years

1352
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:25,640
? Seem like memories

1353
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:28,080
? Broken dreams

1354
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,680
? How can I turn back around

1355
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:39,160
? Slip back and join in the crowd?

1356
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:47,160
? If I could love you now

1357
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,080
? Don't go racing

1358
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:59,080
? With the world in your head

1359
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:07,160
? There's no generation

1360
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:12,200
? Who

1361
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:17,480
? Now let the fear

1362
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:22,520
? Be memories

1363
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,560
? Broken dreams

1364
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:30,880
? How can you turn back around

1365
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:36,400
? Slip back and join in the crowd?

1366
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:42,120
? Forces keep pushing me down

1367
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:47,720
? Yet I would love you

1368
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:54,720
? If you could love everyone around

1369
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:00,720
? If I could love you

1370
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,600
? Ballroom lips

1371
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,600
? On the way home

1372
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:44,240
? You made up my mind

1373
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:50,800
? And l

1374
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,600
? Well, I remained sort of sick

1375
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:00,600
? Now that I know

1376
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:07,560
? What was written in stone

1377
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,360
? Dooh dooh-dooh dah

1378
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:18,640
? Dooh-dooh dooh-dooh dah

1379
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,240
? Dooh dooh

1380
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,880
? Mm mm

1381
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:45,120
? Ballroom lips

1382
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,800
? Fell on the floor

1383
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,360
? You made up my mind

1384
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,960
? But I didn't die

1385
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,760
? Well, I remained sort of sick

1386
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,760
? Now that I know

1387
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:17,760
? What was written in stone

1388
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,920
? We used to talk about

1389
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:29,160
? If everything was right

1390
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:34,360
? The way we spent our time

1391
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:38,960
? It's hard to believe

1392
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:45,160
? Gloat on the design

1393
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:50,640
? Glory and laughter

1394
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:56,320
? Hold my entire world

1395
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,360
? Believe

1396
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,120
? Tumbling

1397
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:20,160
? Out in the yard

1398
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,160
? We were given some time...
