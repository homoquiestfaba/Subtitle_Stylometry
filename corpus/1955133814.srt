00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:41,706
You got the rings?

3
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:44,474
Rings? What rings?

4
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:58,665
Now that is the whitest
woman I've ever seen.

5
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,526
My brothers and sisters,

6
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:28,792
<i>we are gathered here
together in the presence of God,

7
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:32,888
<i>to join this man and this
woman, in holy matrimony.

8
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:38,461
<i>Sarah Kate,</i> there're probably a million
reasons why were shouldn't be married.

9
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:41,108
<i>Some of them are
seated here right today.

10
00:02:42,135 --> 00:02:45,762
When Brenda died I thought
my happiness had ended...

11
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:47,864
mine and Clover's.

12
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:51,844
<i>But I was wrong.</i>
I, Gaten Hill,

13
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:56,311
take you, Sara Kate Johnson,
to be my lawfully wedded wife,

14
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,621
and I pledge before
God and all creation,

15
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:03,007
to be a loyal and
faithful husband,

16
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:07,349
and a good friend,
'til death do us part.

17
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:12,518
Sarah Kate?

18
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:16,394
I, Sarah Kate Johnson...

19
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:53,135
Excuse me.

20
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,480
Hey, Stranger.

21
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,793
- I'm lookin' for my little girl.
- Well, she's not here.

22
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:21,735
Well, I don't know how you know
that until I describe her to you.

23
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,661
- Is she pretty?
- <i>Pretty?

24
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:32,808
Well, now, she's usually
so dirty <i>you can't tell, but...

25
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:39,212
I wouldn't say, "pretty",
my girl is beautiful.

26
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:43,408
<i>- What was she wearing?</i>
- Wearing?

27
00:04:43,813 --> 00:04:47,533
Well, she usually wears these torn
jeans that I forbid her<i> to wear.

28
00:04:48,817 --> 00:04:53,670
<i>But today she's wearing
a very</i> pretty dress.

29
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,561
It's me, Gaten,
you found me.

30
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:05,177
Oh! It's you!
I found my little girl!

31
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,547
- Gaten?
- Huh?

32
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,602
Now that you're married,
you still need me to take care of you?

33
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:20,478
Honey, a man like me
needs lots of taking care of.

34
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:33,177
♫ I'm looking over a four leaf
clover that I overlooked before. ♫

35
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,505
- I hate this song, Gaten.
- <i>I love this song.

the second is rain. ♫

♫ is a pretty girl that I adore. ♫

40
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:52,799
She's pretty, and her name is Clover.

♫ I'm looking over a four leaf
clover that I overlooked before. ♫

43

Here! Here! Over here!

44
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,307
<i>They hate me! Your family hates me!

45
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:33,001
<i>No they don't...</i> no.

46
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:36,285
Do they know we were on the same side in
the Civil War, that I'm from the North?

47
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:39,690
- Do they know that?
- Well, Aunt Katie likes you.

48
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,083
Oh, she's so lovely...
she's okay.

49
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,013
She's also so blind she probably
doesn't even know you're white.

50
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:49,244
- Aw, I'll never fit in.
- Oh, sure you will.

51
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,862
Ya know, if some of your own folks had
been there it might've been a little easier.

52
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,645
No, my family never made
anything easier for anybody.

53
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:59,078
My ears are burning, I'm sure your
family's talking about me right now.

54
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:04,537
Well, the men are... the men are talking
about farmers are always talking about...

55
00:07:04,587 --> 00:07:06,800
the weather

56
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,980
The women? Well...

57
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,882
Well, she did something to him to
make him lose his mind over her.

58
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,646
There is no other
explanation for this.

59
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:17,036
I can understand maybe a one night
stand, but something like that...

60
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:21,169
One night stand? Everleen,
maybe in your family, but never in ours.

61
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:24,071
Oh, no, you might want to
talk to Gideon about that.

62
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:26,247
Well, Merlee,
it is all your fault anyway.

63
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,457
- <i>What?</i>
- You had a chance to marry Gaten.

64
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:33,630
Oh, I know that, Everleen, I just didn't
want to be raising somebody else's child.

65
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:36,715
Child's right there,
have some respect.

66
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:40,297
Clover knows I love her,
don't you, Baby?

67
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:42,527
Well, we didn't need you anyway.

68
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,953
<i>Me and Gaten were doing
just fine</i> by ourselves.

69
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:47,560
Don't need Gaten's
new wife either.

70
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,981
We're married now, not a darn
thing anybody can do about it.

71
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:53,322
Are you sure? I mean, are
you sure we're married?

72
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,710
You're married if you
don't say your vows right?

73
00:07:57,234 --> 00:08:00,954
- Now, that was a little odd.
- Gaten, I memorized them.

74
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:04,547
I knew them backwards
and forwards.

75
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,750
And then, I just...

76
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:11,571
I just looked at your perfect,
perfect daughter, and...

77
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:14,473
- OUR daughter.
- Our daughter.

78
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:20,404
Yeah, and I was trying to figure
out what she was thinking.

79
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,676
<i>Well, that might take some time.

80
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:25,120
And I didn't want to say or do
anything that would upset her.

81
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,384
And I...
I couldn't speak.

82
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:32,103
Nobody's sayin'
what the<i> real problem is.

83
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:37,409
In case you haven't noticed,
Gaten married a white girl.

84
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,152
Gideon,
are you saying that I am a racist?

85
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:46,558
Certainly not, Ma'am, it's a well know fact it's
impossible for a black person to be a racist.

86
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,560
<i>Well, if we are,</i> we had
some very good teachers.

87
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:54,183
White people, how do they
manage to get everything?

88
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,663
<i>I mean, in one day that girl snatched up
the</i> most eligible bachelor in this town.

89
00:08:58,713 --> 00:09:02,294
Not to mention a good,
prime piece of land.

90
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:06,270
<i>Tie me up.
I knew it would come to this.

91
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,980
- No.
- So sin, I didn't think.

92
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,004
What? What?

93
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:13,118
- Yes?
- Okay.

94
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,957
Say your vows now.

95
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:21,236
- You kidding?
- No, not at all.

96
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:25,786
Ya know, as much as I love Clover,
I want you two to love each other.

97
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:29,013
We will, I promise we will, I promise
I'll be a good mother to that child.

98
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:35,573
But even so, marriage, well, that's
something that happened between two people.

99
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,414
You don't need a preacher,
you don't need a congregation

100
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:43,072
Just you, and me, forever.

101
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,322
- Say your vows.
- Okay.

102
00:09:55,307 --> 00:10:01,969
Gaten Hill, I loved you
from the moment I saw you,

103
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,543
a thousand years
ago in college,

104
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,749
when I lost you
the first time.

105
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,175
I thought I was gonna die,
but...

106
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,674
I'm glad that I didn't,

107
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:22,438
because...
I love you Gaten Hill.

108
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:25,895
You ARE the love of my life.

109
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,236
for better or for worse,

110
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:33,317
in sickness and in health,

111
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,168
in good times and bad,

112
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:46,131
until Death do us part.

113
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:49,178
- A month?
- I love you so much.

114
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:55,205
- I love you so much.
- Okay.

115
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:59,866
Okay, seat belts on!
Let's go!

116
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,167
I think that woman has a name.

117
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:12,808
And she didn't come to
this marriage empty handed,

118
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,660
she left a good
job to come here.

119
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,977
- Doin' what?
- Paintin' pictures, if you call that work.

120
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:23,529
And now that she's married to Gaten,
I expect YOU to treat her like family.

121
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,347
God! Don't treat her like family,
she won't last a week.

122
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,338
Well, I am not going to burn myself to a crisp
in that peach orchard while that woman...

123
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:34,696
You mean Sara Kate?

124
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:36,670
- While that woman...
- Sara Kate.

125
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,628
- While that woman...
- SARA KATE.

126
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:42,605
While that woman plays tennis, or
golf, or whatever white women do.

127
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:48,650
No, Everleen Boyd does not take anything off
of anybody no matter what color they are.

128
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,270
If Everleen gets bored again,
she's gonna leave ya.

129
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,285
No, I'm not that lucky.

130
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,154
Oh, Jim Ed!

131
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:57,793
Uncle Jim.

132
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:01,907
Well, it's been a long time since I've been
to a party that brought out the Troopers,

133
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:06,979
- come on in, Max.
- Jim Ed, could I speak with you for a minute?

134
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,528
Privately?

135
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:31,696
There's been an accident.
It seems that Gaten and Sara Kate...

136
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:35,575
- How serious?
- Maybe we should just get down to the hospital.

137
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,729
Oh, God,
forgive me for whatever I said.

138
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,430
I'll drive, somebody take care of Clover.

139
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,588
- I'm coming.
- Honey, maybe you should just...

140
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,479
Gaten needs me.

141
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,584
<i>- Whaddya got?
- We got a decreased lung fluids.

142
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:48,938
Barbara, you got his pressure yet?

143
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:50,052
Got a line in.

144
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,331
Check his pulse off!

145
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,079
- What's his pressure, Barbara?
- 80 over 20.

146
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,401
Soup it up!
Get me another one!

147
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:02,597
<i>Let's go!
Let's go!

148
00:13:03,473 --> 00:13:04,525
<i>Mr. Hill.

149
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:07,421
How serious is it, Doctor?

150
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,676
Gaten's car was struck
on the driver's side.

151
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,261
It looks bad.

152
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,144
Gaten needs me.

153
00:13:13,194 --> 00:13:16,172
We're gonna fly him to Atlanta,
they have excellent facilities there.

154
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:17,590
<i>I wanna see the
man that did this.

155
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,342
Gaten.

156
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,469
<i>Sara Kate

157
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:34,589
Clover.

158
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,350
Clover.

159
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:41,694
How's Gaten?

160
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,275
Nothing's ever too
wrong with him.

161
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,204
<i>Let's go guys!

162
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:50,222
<i>We're bagging him!

163
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:53,766
Gaten! Gaten!

164
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,448
Clover! Clover!

165
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:02,987
Clover.

166
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:06,914
<i>Clover! Wait for me!

167
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:10,278
- Clover, come back here.
- Gaten!

168
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:16,619
Gaten! Gaten!

169
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,190
Gaten!

170
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,680
Gaten!

171
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,739
Gaten, don't leave me!

172
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:46,377
I'm so scared.

173
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,006
<i>I know it was my fault.

174
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,368
Maybe I will have the magic prayer
for getting the words, "I'm sorry."

175
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,886
<i>I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

176
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:01,605
Don't cry.

177
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:05,665
Don't...

178
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:09,050
Don't cry.

179
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,479
I'll check through Gaten's papers
as soon as seems appropriate.

180
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:17,048
Did he make provision for
his part of The Orchard?

181
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:20,216
Gaten assumed the land
was mine and Gideon's.

182
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,281
He never had much feelin'
for workin' The Orchard.

183
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,148
He had feelin' for it...

184
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:27,507
he hated it.

185
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:31,445
He loved The Orchard,
he just hated workin' in it.

186
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,929
Gaten loved school and
books<i> and sports... ya know.

187
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,712
He was allergic to bees.

188
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:42,077
He swelled-up like a football
lunch when he was a kid,

189
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:46,745
So, Grandma wouldn't let him work The
Orchard for the rest of the summer.

190
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:49,784
After that, his biggest problem
was gettin' a bee to sting him

191
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:53,214
early enough every summer so he
could spend his time with his books.

192
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:59,936
- Well, here's to Gaten.
- Gaten.

193
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,246
I'm ready.

194
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,424
We're gonna wear the
white dress today, Honey.

195
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,553
But you're supposed
to wear black.

196
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:14,954
You want to celebrate your father's life,
you father's gone to God.

197
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:19,177
<i>At the service, when the Reverend
asks you to pay your last respects,

198
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:23,608
I want you to stand and pull the satin
cover over your father's face.

199
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,599
I don't want to.

200
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:32,216
Now, this is a hard day for all of us.

201
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:36,357
Now, you can do this,
I want you to make Gaten proud.

202
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,479
Now, put your dress on.

203
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:48,011
It's not right.

204
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,166
Aunt Katie,
aren't you coming?

205
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:35,971
What if a highway stranger should
come by, who would feed him?

206
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:39,133
Who cares about a stranger?
Just lock the door.

207
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:41,412
Oh, you don't want to
talk like that, Child.

208
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:45,498
What if the stranger's The Departed,
comin' to say his last goodbyes?

209
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:48,659
<i>You wouldn't want to
lock Him out, would ya?

210
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:55,060
This is a sad day for us, a sad
day for The Departed, as well.

211
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,032
But we only have to say
goodbye to one person.

212
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:02,181
He has to say his goodbyes to
everyone and everything.

213
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,103
And that might take some time.

214
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,332
Why isn't Aunt
Katie coming?

215
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,197
Just an old custom.

216
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:27,175
Dearly beloved family and friends,

217
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:32,749
we are gathered here today to not only
mourn the passing of our brother Gaten Hill,

218
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:36,055
but also to celebrate his life.

219
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:40,221
<i>Blesséd are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

220
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:43,901
Holy God, Lord of Life and Death,

221
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,995
you made us in your image
and hold us in your care.

222
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:50,386
Let us pray.

223
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,113
Is that you, Gaten?

224
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:02,334
Gaten.

225
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:05,514
If it is you,
you can help yourself to the food,

226
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:09,745
I'm not gonna spoil ya rotten like
Everleen and all the other have.

227
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,909
Besides, I'm at you.

228
00:21:12,065 --> 00:21:15,288
You left us a problem
not of our making.

229
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:21,494
A child...
in my opinion two children.

230
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:24,186
I expect you to postpone
hell until you help us

231
00:21:24,236 --> 00:21:27,264
through this hell you've
raised and left us with.

232
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:59,066
It's time to say goodbye
to your father, Child.

233
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:03,110
- Go on up, Clover, you need to pull-up the mask.
- Come along, Clover.

234
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,136
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

235
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:06,341
<i>No.

236
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:09,334
No, you don't.

237
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,563
Clover is used to
being here with us.

238
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:26,297
And I have been a very good mother
to Clover since Florinda passed on.

239
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:32,633
And to tell the truth, Reverend, I couldn't
bear to lose Clover so soon after losing Gaten.

240
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:36,073
I know, I know,
it's for the good of the child.

241
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:39,493
Thanks for comin' by and
talkin' with us, Reverend.

242
00:22:39,543 --> 00:22:42,279
We appreciate it.
You drive carefully, now.

243
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:04,187
Why are you unpacking?

244
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:13,690
This is my home.

245
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:15,720
No it's not.

246
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,591
It became my home
when I married Gaten.

247
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,922
And...

248
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,606
you became my child.

249
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,723
You're nobody to me
now that Gaten's dead.

250
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:32,022
Really?

251
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,498
Nobody?

252
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,833
And I don't need a mother,
I've got too many mothers.

253
00:23:42,124 --> 00:23:44,861
Who do you
wanna go with?

254
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:46,273
Nobody.

255
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,285
Well, here I am.

256
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:01,138
Why are you staying here?

257
00:24:04,165 --> 00:24:07,162
I'll answer you that question
if you answer me a question.

258
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,985
<i>Why did you make yourself
bleed at the funeral?

259
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:21,426
It's okay, Clover, sometimes I do
things I can't explain, either.

260
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:30,114
Who do you wanna go with?

261
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,165
Gaten.

262
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:38,378
<i>Sara Kate.

263
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,640
Gaten?

264
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,693
Gaten!

265
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,975
Gaten...

266
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,790
One thing you should know...

267
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,992
I promised Clover's father that I
would take care of our daughter.

268
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:27,272
You takin' her back to Boston?

269
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:31,116
No, I think it's best that
she stays here, don't you?

270
00:26:31,684 --> 00:26:33,549
The child barely knows you.

271
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:43,532
Let's go Evie.
It's what Gaten wanted.

272
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,735
Damn you, Gaten.

273
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,686
<i>It seems wrong for
there to be so much sun.

274
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:39,453
<i>Isn't it?

275
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,418
I dreamt about Gaten.

276
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:48,542
Was it a bad dream?

277
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,171
Not until I woke up.

278
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:59,974
What about breakfast?

279
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:02,718
I usually just have coffee.

280
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,819
I didn't mean for you.

281
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:07,952
Oh, of course.

282
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,697
I'm not used to...

283
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,389
You go get dressed...

284
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,512
and I'll get your breakfast.

285
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:40,173
I always have grits.

286
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:45,108
Grits... okay... grits.

287
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,097
Honey, I don't know
how to cook grits.

288
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,079
You don't know
how to make grits?

289
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:54,977
Never heard of them.

290
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:58,608
If you can't even make a bowl of grits,
how are you supposed to take care of me?

291
00:28:58,658 --> 00:28:59,883
Sorry to be a disappointment.

292
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:02,334
Well, it's not as bad as
when you came the first time.

293
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:04,489
I thought you were gonna
be a 10-speed bicycle.

294
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,837
I beg your pardon.

295
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,435
Gaten said he was
bringing me a surprise.

296
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,697
<i>I thought it was gonna
be a 10-speed bicycle.

297
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:15,220
Turned out to be you.

298
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:17,991
Listen... Clover...

299
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:20,478
if I disappoint you again,

300
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,812
I want you to tell me about it, and
I'll do something right away, okay?

301
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:32,591
I... I don't think you can, Ma'am.

302
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:34,506
What is it, Clover?

303
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:37,574
You can tell me and then we
can work it out together.

304
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,381
Well...

305
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,589
it's just...

306
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,661
<i>um...

307
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,542
I was thinkin'...

308
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,065
if you hadn't o' come here,
Gaten never would have died.

309
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,686
<i>- You told me to tell you.</i>
- I know, no, I'm glad you did.

310
00:30:10,736 --> 00:30:12,308
You don't look glad.

311
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,245
- Are you gonna cry?
- Um... yes.

312
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:21,937
Don't cry!
You're supposed to take care of me!

313
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,517
I'm not gonna take care of you!

314
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:27,272
- It's not fair!
- Exactly right.

315
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:30,587
Um... let's...

316
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:34,405
Let's go out for breakfast, we'll
get some<i> grits, whatever they are.

317
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:35,974
And... uh...

318
00:30:37,996 --> 00:30:40,116
We'll buy a bike, okay?

319
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:42,387
Let's go!
C'mon! C'mon!

320
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,265
<i>I'll get it.

321
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,883
<i>Hello, this is Gaten Hill,

322
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,393
<i>- if I'm not in the office, I'm</i>
- Gaten?

323
00:30:49,443 --> 00:30:51,298
<i>probably out chasing Clover.

324
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,413
<i>If you leave a message, I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

325
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,716
<i>Clover, I thought we agreed,

326
00:30:56,766 --> 00:30:59,409
<i>you were supposed to start back
at the peach shed this morning.

327
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,830
<i>Now, rise and shine and
get down here to work.

328
00:31:02,312 --> 00:31:04,737
<i>Clover, who was it?

329
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:07,407
- Wrong number!
- Wrong number?

330
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,197
Sounded like, "God is mean to me."

331
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:10,178
Gaten!

332
00:31:18,705 --> 00:31:19,838
Gaten?

333
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:15,878
Where you been, Missy, you were supposed to
be here early this morning to help me out.

334
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,676
Was she?
I didn't realize.

335
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:22,555
- I called.
- But, we only got one call and that was a...

336
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,514
- It won't happen again.
- Well, it better not, because I need the help.

337
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:30,657
Take those empty baskets
in the back for me.

338
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,400
Maybe I could come by
to help out sometime.

339
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,439
This isn't your kind of work.

340
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,548
May I take a peach?

341
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:44,444
You askin' me for peaches?

342
00:32:44,494 --> 00:32:46,959
<i>Part of this orchard
belonged to Gaten Hill...

343
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,643
You did marry him,
in case you've forgotten.

344
00:32:56,658 --> 00:33:00,231
Everleen, have I done
something to offend you?

345
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,971
I'll be honest with you...

346
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:04,319
I've lived most of my
life knowing the right

347
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:06,807
thing to do by watchin'
what white people do,

348
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:09,657
and then doin'
the exact opposite.

349
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:11,839
And I haven't been
wrong all that often.

350
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,072
Have you done
anything to offend me?

351
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:19,664
If I'm not mistaken, that's a brand new
bicycle stuck in the back of your truck.

352
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:22,756
<i>Now, what that child needs
now is an abundance of love,

353
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:25,850
and the security that comes with hard,
honest work,

354
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,255
not some white woman's
expensive toys.

355
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,741
I'll see you back at the house, Clover.

356
00:33:38,996 --> 00:33:40,575
<i>We'll eat at 5:30.

357
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,962
Looks like she
bought-out the store.

358
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:46,369
She did spend a lot of money,

359
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,498
<i>but she didn't buy any
of the things I eat.

360
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:52,207
<i>Well, don't ya worry, Baby, you're not
gonna go hungry as long as I'm around.

361
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:56,242
Bet she hasn't had a
piece of meat in years.

362
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:04,574
It would've all been much, much easier if you
had brought home that bicycle instead of me.

363
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:12,067
But the only thing Clover and
I have in common is that we

364
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,719
both wish that I had died in
that crash instead of you.

365
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:31,174
It's not gonna work, Gaten.

366
00:34:34,711 --> 00:34:36,610
It's not gonna work.

367
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:56,281
Wow! This reads like a
recipe for a triple bypass.

368
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,101
Hel...

369
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:12,909
Clover?

370
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:15,380
Oh, hi, Mom,
how are you?

371
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:18,160
You wouldn't know what a
fat back is, would you?

372
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:21,183
Neither do any
of my friends.

373
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,611
I'm thinking of staying
where I am staying, Mother.

374
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,166
There's a child, Mother.

375
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:31,182
Her name is Clover.

376
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:36,275
Yeah, yeah, we're getting
on together really well.

377
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:39,679
I know you warned me, Mother.

378
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,859
Well, some people do
marry for love, Mother.

379
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,258
Well, maybe it wasn't a fake, my
biscuits are burning, Mom, I gotta go.

380
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,726
No, I don't need any money.

381
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:55,446
Yeah, goodbye.

382
00:35:57,076 --> 00:36:01,772
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry,
don't cry, don't cry,

383
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,969
Now, that was batter.

384
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:12,700
I made it special for Clover.

385
00:36:13,156 --> 00:36:15,405
It's a shame Sara
Kate didn't come over.

386
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,612
Well, you know how white women are.

387
00:36:18,104 --> 00:36:19,805
<i>No I don't, how are they?

388
00:36:21,132 --> 00:36:22,410
Standoff-ish.

389
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:27,062
Well, I guess maybe you could say
they call it, "reserved" and cheerful.

390
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:29,885
She came by the peach shed
this morning all smiles.

391
00:36:29,935 --> 00:36:32,979
"Maybe I can come by
and help out sometime."

392
00:36:34,476 --> 00:36:37,925
Well, that's her, but I don't
think it sounds standoff-ish.

393
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,874
What did she say<i> when you
invited her to dinner?

394
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:44,613
Would you like some desert now?

395
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,424
You asked her, didn't you?

396
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,554
You left her in the house by herself,
and that woman's in mourning?

397
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:00,862
Well, it won't go on long,
mourning for them is short.

398
00:37:01,336 --> 00:37:04,062
Funny, they just don't love as hard as we do.

399
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:09,525
Jim Ed, where are you goin'?

400
00:37:10,483 --> 00:37:13,436
To call Sara Kate to
apologize for your behavior.

401
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:17,636
Don't you dare! If you embarrass me in front
of that woman, you'll never see me again.

402
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:19,466
I think I'll go home now.

403
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:21,477
<i>Sit down,</i>
eat your desert.

404
00:37:26,128 --> 00:37:27,661
She's family now.

405
00:37:28,593 --> 00:37:29,741
<i>Family.

406
00:37:30,704 --> 00:37:32,900
Are you gonna call her,
or am I?

407
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:36,092
Well, what can I say except,
"I'm sorry"?

408
00:37:36,142 --> 00:37:38,340
But I've already said that twice.

409
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:40,742
Well, it won't happen again.

410
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,910
At least not without
a phone call.

411
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,864
<i>Oh, uh, Sara Kate, Clover's
gonna be staying here tonight...

412
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:47,758
<i>that is if it's okay with you.

413
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,862
<i>No, no, that's all right,
she has plenty of clothes here.

414
00:37:54,002 --> 00:37:56,922
<i>All right, good night.

415
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,279
It's a heavy load you're
carrying around, Everleen.

416
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:12,196
You oughta put it down before
you go to church next time.

417
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:26,216
<i>Now, remember, we never</i> repeat
the things we talk about here.

418
00:38:27,313 --> 00:38:29,159
It's family talk.

419
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,407
Sure, stay down there,
see what I care.

420
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:41,862
Hell, Clover's a better thing than I did.

421
00:38:42,234 --> 00:38:43,704
What was Gaten thinking?

422
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,069
It's not your kind of work.

423
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:50,361
You've nothing decent since Gaten died.

424
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,622
Why are you staying
when we're not?

425
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,915
Gaten left and no
one blamed him.

426
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,864
Well, I can disappear, too, Gaten.

427
00:38:58,484 --> 00:39:00,212
I can disappear, too.

428
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,226
Ya gotta be strong,
Sara Kate.

429
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,118
I'm not strong.

430
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:17,590
You know that.

431
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,682
You always confuse
"strong" and "tough".

432
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:30,886
They're different.

433
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:36,428
- Pick a beach.
- I hate beaches.

434
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:40,951
I never want to see another
beach as long as I live.

435
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,187
Silly girl, you've never really
seen a beach in your whole life.

436
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:47,609
Yes I have.

437
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,029
Everything's so nice...
nice and clear.

438
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:58,274
Everything's a little fuzzy.

439
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:02,223
You have...
you have to see how they grow.

440
00:40:06,627 --> 00:40:10,421
All the force that's in the Earth

441
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,732
pushes its way up,

442
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:22,009
and reaches up to
the roof of the tree.

443
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,401
A leaf with all
that power makes...

444
00:40:27,711 --> 00:40:29,001
a flower.

445
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,846
And the flower becomes a bud,

446
00:40:35,574 --> 00:40:36,832
and that bud...

447
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,424
a peach.

448
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,325
A peach.

449
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,436
I'm starting to like peaches.

450
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:53,739
That peach is so...
so soft,

451
00:40:54,382 --> 00:40:56,267
that anything can bruise it.

452
00:40:57,314 --> 00:40:59,453
But it's so strong

453
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:03,619
that nothing...
nothing can stop it from growing.

454
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:09,103
By the thousands,
year after year after year.

455
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,278
And you...

456
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,751
you haven't even gone
out to take a look.

457
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,590
Okay...

458
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:22,169
let's go.

459
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,413
Don't go...

460
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,789
stay with me.

461
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,486
Damn you, Gaten.

462
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:11,244
Hello.

463
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:14,145
<i>- Sorry to wake you, Sara Kate.</i>
- Jim Ed.

464
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:15,567
Is Clover with you?

465
00:43:16,342 --> 00:43:18,661
Why don't you ask Everleen
about that, Jim Ed.

466
00:43:18,786 --> 00:43:20,557
<i>Clover's not here, Sara Kate.

467
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,311
<i>It looks like she packed
her bag and ran away.

468
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,172
What?

469
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:28,957
<i>She left a note sayin' she was
going to look for Gaten.

470
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,654
<i>Do you know
what that means?

471
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,401
<i>Sara Kate?

472
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:37,340
<i>- Sara Kate!</i>
- Call the police, Jim Ed... now.

473
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:58,063
Y'all come on in, I'm
gonna make some coffee.

474
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,946
Yeah, we'll re-group and then
we'll start in again in an hours

475
00:44:00,996 --> 00:44:04,161
I wanna thank y'all for helpin' us out.

476
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:06,191
Jim Ed! Jim Ed!

477
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:18,069
She must've come back while
we were out looking for her.

478
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:19,421
Oh...

479
00:44:19,886 --> 00:44:22,769
Tell me this isn't the
sweetest sight in the world.

480
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:27,020
Sweet? I'm givin' this child the
spanking of her life when she wakes up.

481
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,889
Then I just won't wake up then.

482
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,150
Well, Jim Ed, it looks like you
won't be needin' us anymore.

483
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,143
I wanna thank you fellas,
I really appreciate it.

484
00:44:37,193 --> 00:44:39,392
What do you mean scarin'
us out of our wits?

485
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:42,669
I was with Gaten.

486
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:47,269
<i>He walked me home</i> and he
sang that song he always sings.

487
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:49,582
<i>I saw him, too, last night.

488
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:54,259
<i>Plain as day.</i>
It was a dream, Honey

489
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:01,331
I saw him.

490
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,045
None of you believe me.

491
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:10,628
Baby, now, listen,
Gaten has gone on to heaven.

492
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:12,962
I'm going to bed.

493
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:27,561
- Thanks for all your help.
- Well, I know what it's like.

494
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:30,603
I'm raisin' a daughter
since my wife passed on.

495
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,961
So, if you ever need any
help, don't hesitate to call.

496
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:37,107
That's very nice, Mister...?

497
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:38,492
Chase.

498
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:40,461
Chase Porter,
I was a friend to Gaten.

499
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,677
Well, I better get goin'.

500
00:45:47,072 --> 00:45:50,077
What can I say about
the most obvious thing?

501
00:45:50,427 --> 00:45:53,825
And I would say the same thing to a
black parent raising a white child...

502
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:56,159
It never works.

503
00:45:57,186 --> 00:46:01,363
Look, it's not going to be easy
for her to come back to school.

504
00:46:01,938 --> 00:46:07,040
In some ways, this building was more
home to Gaten and Clover than home was.

505
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:11,145
He made this school,
his memory is everywhere.

506
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:13,000
Any suggestions?

507
00:46:14,886 --> 00:46:19,809
A great deal of love,
and a very firm hand.

508
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:26,732
One thing you can tell Clover: she'll be
in the gifted and talented class this year.

509
00:46:28,142 --> 00:46:30,343
I'm sure she'll
be very pleased.

510
00:46:30,593 --> 00:46:32,791
I can't be in the gifted
and talented class.

511
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:34,218
Why not?

512
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:35,767
You've been with
me all summer,

513
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:39,087
have you seen one sign that
I'm even gifted or talented?

514
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:43,313
Uh... well... it will all seem better
when you get some new clothes for school.

515
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:45,071
I don't want new clothes!

516
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:47,503
I... I don't want new anything!

517
00:46:47,553 --> 00:46:49,762
I just want things to
be the way they were!

518
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:56,171
What is this?

519
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,606
Pot salad.

520
00:46:59,506 --> 00:47:03,284
It's a balanced, nutritional meal...
proteins, carbohydrates...

521
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:05,426
I don't want a
science project!

522
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:07,562
- I just want some lunch!
- What's going on?

523
00:47:07,612 --> 00:47:10,891
- I've never seen you like this.
- I'm gonna eat at the peach shed.

524
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:13,060
Sit down and eat your lunch!

525
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:15,855
Take your practice
salad and shove it!

526
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:17,893
Damn it!
Clover!

527
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,660
Get back here!

528
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,333
- That any way to talk to Sara Kate?
- Shut up!

529
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:25,125
- How dare you talk to me that way.
- I wasn't talking to you.

530
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,851
Clover, you're going to get back
in there and you're going to eat your...

531
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:30,343
Everleen needs me, and you
don't want to cross Everleen.

532
00:47:30,393 --> 00:47:33,877
She'll throw the bones at you<i> and
then you'll be sorry,</i> you'll see!

533
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,101
Throw the bones?

534
00:47:39,184 --> 00:47:41,340
Clover, you are not going
out in those clothes.

535
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,432
Clover, you're gonna get back in there and
you're gonna eat your lunch, then Clover...

536
00:47:44,482 --> 00:47:45,746
Clover you're going to clean your room.

537
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,042
Clover!
Clover!

538
00:47:48,092 --> 00:47:49,818
Stay out of my road!

539
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:51,800
Clover!

540
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:55,686
So much for the firm idea.

541
00:47:57,226 --> 00:48:03,789
Psychiatrists! Good heavens!
I see those talk shows.

542
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:07,988
- Terrible people.
- She has to talk to someone.

543
00:48:08,038 --> 00:48:12,818
You! She needs to talk with you!
You're her mother now.

544
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:15,604
She started,
but I think I frightened her.

545
00:48:16,348 --> 00:48:18,404
Of course she's frightened,

546
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,755
poor child's livin'
with a white woman,

547
00:48:22,005 --> 00:48:24,531
that's enough to frighten anybody.

548
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:27,383
Are white women
really so terrible?

549
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,770
White women?

550
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,618
Terrible people! Cold, distant,

551
00:48:35,023 --> 00:48:40,025
work your fingers to the bone for the
last few dollars they begrudge you.

552
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:43,544
I see your point...
my mother is a white woman.

553
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:48,108
Clover says she SEES Gaten.

554
00:48:50,081 --> 00:48:52,933
Really?
How is he doin'?

555
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:57,752
- This doesn't bother you?
- Be bother me more if she didn't.

556
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:02,789
Somebody has to look after the dead...
ease 'em through "The Passage".

557
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:08,909
It should be in a dump, but the
Hills are not a grieving family.

558
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:14,946
They turn their sorrow into work and
the Lord blesses them for their labor.

559
00:49:15,978 --> 00:49:18,849
But it leaves the
child alone to grieve.

560
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,473
I almost think I saw
him the other night.

561
00:49:23,647 --> 00:49:26,182
You did?
How'd ya feel?

562
00:49:26,232 --> 00:49:28,391
Thrilled.

563
00:49:29,578 --> 00:49:35,147
For a second, then it was like...
losing him all over again.

564
00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:39,084
How do you think the child feels?
The child is grievin'.

565
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:43,063
Hard work,
there's nobody willin' to do it.

566
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,731
- She needs company.
- Even from a white woman?

567
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:47,881
Has nothin' to do with race.

568
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:49,389
<i>Thank God for that.

569
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:52,826
Oh, this is harder that
race, this is family.

570
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:55,613
There is nothin'
harder than family.

571
00:49:55,872 --> 00:49:58,336
You are a wise, old woman.

572
00:49:59,482 --> 00:50:01,869
Age has nothin'
to do with it.

573
00:50:03,073 --> 00:50:05,801
I was smart when
I was young.

574
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,926
Go on, finish up your lemonade,
you're keepin' me from my soups.

575
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:09,773
Clover, when you see Gaten,
how do you see him?

576
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:15,565
First I feel him...
behind me.

577
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,077
When I turn,
sometimes he's there...

578
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:20,318
sometimes not.

579
00:51:20,939 --> 00:51:23,035
If he's not there I get sad.

580
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:25,510
I was sad once.

581
00:51:27,439 --> 00:51:29,966
So sad I didn't feel
like living anymore.

582
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:31,603
Why?

583
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:37,592
Well...
found out I couldn't have children.

584
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:43,562
I wanted to die,
I was very sad.

585
00:51:44,546 --> 00:51:46,644
You wanted a kid that bad?

586
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,355
Still do.

587
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,175
You don't want to ruin my
drawing, you better not smile.

588
00:52:19,326 --> 00:52:20,839
What the hell.

589
00:52:31,852 --> 00:52:34,622
<i>Oh, I hope I'm not disturbin'.

590
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:36,233
Not at all,
not at all.

591
00:52:38,415 --> 00:52:40,749
Some of the back of your house
is gettin' out of control and

592
00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:45,397
I had some time this mornin',
so, I brought my ridin' mower.

593
00:52:45,447 --> 00:52:47,058
Wasn't that thoughtful.

594
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,351
C'mon in, have a seat.

595
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:57,580
Clover! We've got company.

596
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:06,609
Ya know, I used to come
here when Gaten was...

597
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,674
<i>Well, Gaten was a friend.

598
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:11,104
Once, you came here once.

599
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,459
And you weren't really
that good a friend.

600
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:16,462
<i>- How's your daughter, Chase?</i>
- She's a pig.

601
00:53:16,512 --> 00:53:19,188
Claire's at an awkward age.

602
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,668
But she's fine, just fine,
she has a birthday comin' up.

603
00:53:22,718 --> 00:53:25,663
<i>- You and Clover are invited.
- Oh, great.

604
00:53:32,594 --> 00:53:34,909
Seems like everybody's
in church but us.

605
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:43,473
- Clover, maybe she's...
- Well, I better get to work.

606
00:53:43,523 --> 00:53:46,523
- Have some iced tea first.
- Oh, I'll get it, Chase, how do you like it?

607
00:53:46,573 --> 00:53:48,307
Well, no sugar, please.

608
00:54:31,094 --> 00:54:32,886
My! That's good iced tea.

609
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,143
- Just the way I like it.
- That's what I thought.

610
00:54:57,713 --> 00:55:00,689
Hey, Stranger,
<i>I'm lookin' for my little girl.

611
00:55:00,974 --> 00:55:03,252
It's not going to work this time, Gaten.

612
00:55:03,302 --> 00:55:06,706
You won't talk to anybody else,
so everybody thinks I'm crazy.

613
00:55:06,756 --> 00:55:09,858
Sweetheart, I talk,
they... they just don't listen.

614
00:55:09,908 --> 00:55:12,581
Well, then I'm not going
to listen anymore either.

615
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:18,181
- That makes me feel lonely, Clover.
- You! How do you think I feel?

616
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,997
You go away and leave me with
a mother<i> I don't even know.

617
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,170
I thought you and Sara Kate
were getting along better.

618
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,505
- We had a talk.
<i>- About what?

619
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:29,152
Woman stuff, Gaten,
you wouldn't understand.

620
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,907
<i>But now...</i>
you can't trust her.

621
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:42,135
Sweetheart, maybe you
shouldn't be playing up there.

622
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:43,953
Don't tell me what to do!

623
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:46,933
"Don't do this" and "Don't do that",
"What would Gaten say?"

624
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:50,492
You boss me around more now than
you ever did when you were alive.

625
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:53,215
- Clover, get down from there.
- No! I'm not listening to you!

626
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:56,168
You're dead,
<i> I don't need you anymore!

627
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:59,102
<i>See! You wanted me to have a new
mother,</i> and now I've got one.

628
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:02,461
And she' gonna go away with my new
father and they're gonna take me with them.

629
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:05,255
So, go away, I don't
need you anymore, Gaten!

630
00:56:05,505 --> 00:56:07,425
- Clover.
- Leave me alone.

631
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:14,550
- Daddy!
<i>- Clover!

632
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,697
- Daddy!
<i>- Clover!

633
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,276
<i>Oh, no.

634
00:56:20,363 --> 00:56:21,286
It's all right.

635
00:56:22,036 --> 00:56:23,604
- It's all right.
- Put me down!

636
00:56:23,654 --> 00:56:25,560
Put me down!
Put me down!

637
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,676
- Honey, c'mon.
- Leave me alone!

638
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,316
Good night, Clover.

639
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,329
Please close my door.

640
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:02,630
I don't want you spying on me.

641
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,626
Gaten?

642
00:57:45,571 --> 00:57:46,795
I'm here.

643
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:55,250
Clover told me you're goin' away.

644
00:57:56,341 --> 00:57:58,522
- And she meant it.
- No, no, no.

645
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,127
Whatever she said to
you, she didn't mean it.

646
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:07,244
Even if she did,
she still needs you.

647
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,216
What about you?

648
00:58:15,012 --> 00:58:16,949
Do you need me?

649
00:58:17,324 --> 00:58:19,006
No, no I can't.

650
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:24,192
I can't, somebody has to
stay sane around here.

651
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,469
Gaten.

652
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:37,234
How was the gifted
and talented class?

653
00:59:37,284 --> 00:59:40,469
I'm not going back
to that school... ever.

654
00:59:48,911 --> 00:59:51,658
It's your turn,
Gaten, yeah, yeah.

655
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:57,998
Ha! I won again.
Hit restart.

656
01:00:02,243 --> 01:00:04,621
<i>Three in a row,
I win, Gaten.

657
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:12,552
Why did you go there? Ah, man!
<i>You start this time. You're X.

658
01:00:16,223 --> 01:00:18,208
- Clover.
- Did I say something funny?

659
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:20,142
Eh, it was a game.

660
01:00:20,878 --> 01:00:23,357
See, when Gaten was busy on the computer,

661
01:00:23,407 --> 01:00:25,436
he'd tell her, "You play for me."

662
01:00:25,486 --> 01:00:29,437
And she'd play and when she
was finished she'd say,

663
01:00:29,487 --> 01:00:32,017
- "You lose again, Gaten."
- Gaten.

664
01:00:33,761 --> 01:00:37,620
<i>Oh, yes!</i> All she needs
is an abundance of love.

665
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,291
That's what Aunt Katie said.

666
01:00:40,469 --> 01:00:43,747
Now, if you don't mind,
Sara Kate...

667
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:46,712
I'd like t' get to what we
asked you over to talk about.

668
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:49,965
Oh? I thought it was Clover.

669
01:00:51,493 --> 01:00:55,058
Sara Kate,
money will never be a problem,

670
01:00:55,108 --> 01:00:57,807
but since Gaten
didn't leave a will,

671
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,848
Yes.

672
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:07,118
We thought it might be a
good idea if you made a will.

673
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:08,685
- Soon.
- Soon.

674
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:11,718
What's the rush?

675
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,748
You're frightening me,
what is it?

676
01:01:16,425 --> 01:01:20,700
Well, Chase Porter was at
your house the other day.

677
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,449
Yes, he was.

678
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:24,773
Has he been coming to
your house for dinner?

679
01:01:25,479 --> 01:01:27,043
Yes, but...

680
01:01:27,093 --> 01:01:29,237
<i>- what does that have to do...</i>
- See, Sara Kate,

681
01:01:29,287 --> 01:01:32,441
this land has been in the family
for over a hundred years.

682
01:01:32,491 --> 01:01:36,188
In fact, it's the oldest black
owned piece of land in the county.

683
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:39,465
We want to make sure
it stays in the family.

684
01:01:40,748 --> 01:01:44,249
And you think Chase Porter and
I are going to take your land?

685
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:53,952
Someone needs a psychiatrist
and it's not Clover.

686
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,397
Sara Kate, I'm sorry if I
made your feel uncomfortable.

687
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:01,288
<i>Uncomfortable?</i> This is the most
at home I've felt since I got here.

688
01:02:01,338 --> 01:02:04,423
<i>You... you are exactly
like my family back home.

689
01:02:04,473 --> 01:02:07,437
<i>My father and my brothers are</i> in real
estate, they think JUST like you.

690
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:09,914
I mean, of course, with them it's,
"Watch out for the blacks".

691
01:02:09,964 --> 01:02:12,431
<i>And with you it's,
"Watch out for the whites".

692
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:14,429
But other than that,
Aunt Katie was right,

693
01:02:14,479 --> 01:02:17,054
it's not about race,
it's just family.

694
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:21,087
Thanks for a lovely dinner.

695
01:02:22,935 --> 01:02:24,272
What about the will?

696
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,373
I'm afraid you're just gonna
have to trust me on that.

697
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:30,474
I'm only trying to protect
my husband's land.

698
01:02:30,724 --> 01:02:32,922
Is she speaking for you,
Jim Ed?

699
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,803
Boud Ellis' house sits on
property that used to belong to us.

700
01:02:37,156 --> 01:02:40,099
Papa sold that land to
pay for Gates tuition.

701
01:02:40,363 --> 01:02:44,129
I've lost a lot for Gaten,
<i>I don't want to lose anymore.

702
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:46,323
I married Gaten Hill
because I loved him.

703
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,728
I loved him since the moment
I met him in college.

704
01:02:51,022 --> 01:02:52,485
<i>He wrecked my life once
because he thought race

705
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:54,577
<i>was so important he couldn't
marry a white woman.

706
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:57,346
<i>Among other things, he didn't
think his family would approve.

707
01:02:57,396 --> 01:02:58,687
<i>So he married Brenda.

708
01:02:58,737 --> 01:03:02,635
<i>And when she died,
</i> I did not call him, HE called ME.

709
01:03:03,894 --> 01:03:08,553
<i>He told me that</i> in time, you would
get to know me and love me like he did.

710
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:11,059
<i>It was about love,

711
01:03:11,893 --> 01:03:13,840
not your land.

712
01:03:16,131 --> 01:03:19,814
And, by the way, the reason
I encourage Chase to come by?

713
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:22,585
It's because he is the only one
who ever came to visit me.

714
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:24,898
Good night.

715
01:03:29,326 --> 01:03:32,697
<i>- Your family hates me.
- No, they don't.

716
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,462
<i>Do they know we were on the same side
in the Civil War, that I'm from the North.

717
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:40,540
<i>- Well, Aunt Katie likes you.
- Oh, she's so lovely.

718
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:42,488
<i>She's okay.

719
01:03:42,538 --> 01:03:45,399
<i>She's also so blind, she probably
doesn't even know you're white.

720
01:03:47,168 --> 01:03:48,589
Gaten!

721
01:03:50,657 --> 01:03:55,610
Oh, Gaten,
not while I'm driving.

722
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:12,070
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Sara Kate Johnston.

723
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,702
Gaten...

724
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,875
is this what Clover's
going through?

725
01:04:17,865 --> 01:04:21,503
Because it's hard, Gaten.
It's hard.

726
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:36,317
But if she can do it,
so can I.

727
01:04:37,828 --> 01:04:39,035
Okay.

728
01:04:40,406 --> 01:04:41,999
I'm lookin' for Sara Kate.

729
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:44,493
I'm Sara Kate Johnston.

730
01:04:44,668 --> 01:04:47,254
And I'm Gaten Hill,
your math tutor.

731
01:04:47,304 --> 01:04:49,800
- But you're...
- Black.

732
01:04:52,587 --> 01:04:56,547
- Is there going to be a problem?
- No. No.

733
01:04:56,597 --> 01:04:59,521
I was going to say, "You're handsome",
and yeah...

734
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:01,715
that could be a problem.

735
01:05:04,344 --> 01:05:05,674
Gaten.

736
01:05:07,735 --> 01:05:08,809
Gaten.

737
01:05:13,447 --> 01:05:14,761
Gaten.

738
01:05:29,585 --> 01:05:35,043
Ya know, I always hoped I'd
marry somebody just like you.

739
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:38,176
I always thought
you'd be black.

740
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:42,825
Oh, Gaten, I don't want
to remember this part.

741
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:48,458
Yeah, well, we gotta talk
about it sometime, Sara Kate.

742
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:50,556
Well...

743
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:55,570
I always thought I'd marry
somebody just like you, only...

744
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:02,010
it doesn't make any difference,
does it?

745
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:04,837
We love each other.

746
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:08,984
No!

747
01:06:09,294 --> 01:06:10,450
No!

748
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,945
This almost killed
me the first time.

749
01:06:14,995 --> 01:06:18,452
Enough!
Enough!

750
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:46,235
Come on, Katie, pick up.

751
01:06:47,527 --> 01:06:49,000
Sara Kate.

752
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:53,765
I know it's been a... long time.

753
01:06:53,815 --> 01:06:55,049
Do you even remember me.

754
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:56,831
Please don't.

755
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,587
My wife died a while back, Sara Kate, and...

756
01:07:01,153 --> 01:07:03,417
I just need
somebody to talk to.

757
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:07,147
I had no one else to call.

758
01:07:10,182 --> 01:07:13,250
I know there's no good reason
you should see me, but...

759
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,241
- can you and me talk?
- I should've said no.

760
01:07:17,291 --> 01:07:18,496
Please?

761
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,143
I see.
This weekend?

762
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:25,090
I'll be there.

763
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,416
Let's stop there,
Gaten, please.

764
01:07:30,907 --> 01:07:32,805
<i>- Hello</i>
- Katie?

765
01:07:34,705 --> 01:07:38,397
Aunt Katie, I know it's late, but...

766
01:07:39,926 --> 01:07:43,335
I'll come to get you...you
just stay the night here.

767
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:45,926
<i>I'll be on the porch waiting.

768
01:07:51,754 --> 01:07:52,917
No!

769
01:07:54,226 --> 01:07:57,265
<i>I want you to promise me
you'll look after Clover.

770
01:07:57,415 --> 01:07:58,647
<i>No matter what.

771
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:02,930
<i>I can barely get myself through the day,
how am I going to look after her?

772
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:05,928
<i>- She needs you.
- Huh!

773
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:08,482
<i>She's the most self-sufficient
kid I've ever seen.

774
01:08:09,107 --> 01:08:10,285
<i>Besides...

775
01:08:11,205 --> 01:08:13,321
<i>she's got a perfect father.

776
01:08:13,371 --> 01:08:14,614
Exactly!

777
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:17,651
I've always had to be
perfect to get where I am.

778
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:22,034
And Clover's worked hard to be a
perfect daughter to please me.

779
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:25,851
God, I envy you both.

780
01:08:26,804 --> 01:08:30,176
Don't, a perfect world is fragile.

781
01:08:30,626 --> 01:08:34,003
And when her world falls apart,
she'll need you, not a perfect father.

782
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:37,443
Why, because I know the territory?

783
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:39,933
Thanks for throwing that in
my face on our wedding night.

784
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:43,190
- Come on, it's your strength.
- I'm not strong.

785
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:47,657
You always confuse strong and
tough... they're different.

786
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:51,856
Okay... I'll be there
to pick up the pieces.

787
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,429
- Good.
- Okay.

788
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:00,597
No, no, I want you to keep me
from picking up the pieces.

789
01:09:00,848 --> 01:09:02,742
Let that perfect world shatter.

790
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,790
How else will Clover ever
find out what kind of young

791
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,639
woman is living inside of
that perfect little girl?

792
01:09:14,382 --> 01:09:20,148
I promise to protect her from
you... and your perfect ways,

793
01:09:22,317 --> 01:09:24,545
to love her with all my heart.

794
01:09:24,695 --> 01:09:26,009
Hold on to her.

795
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:28,294
I will, always.

796
01:09:29,261 --> 01:09:31,543
It's like I'm holding you.

797
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:45,083
I can't deal with it,
can't do it.

798
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:49,233
- I can't do it, I can't do it.
- Sara Kate

799
01:09:49,283 --> 01:09:53,138
I can't do it.

800
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:56,300
You've done it,
you've already done it.

801
01:09:57,563 --> 01:10:00,486
It's all right, it's all right,
it's okay, it's okay.

802
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:18,605
<i>Sara Kate and Everleen are gonna
find out, you know that, don't you?

803
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,835
How, they never talk to each other.

804
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:54,840
What do you think you're doing?

805
01:10:56,091 --> 01:10:58,380
I'm doing what Gaten
should've done a long time ago...

806
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:01,450
fixing this house, and then...

807
01:11:01,812 --> 01:11:03,587
we're going to Chase's
daughter's birthday party.

808
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:06,301
I have to work,
most definitely.

809
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:17,819
Perfect Chase's daughter's birthday party.

810
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:38,492
You're both out
of the game.

811
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:40,412
What're you talkin' about?

812
01:11:40,662 --> 01:11:42,707
I haven't had such a good
time in I don't know when.

813
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:44,875
Shame Clover couldn't come.

814
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,168
Yeah, her aunt keeps
her awfully busy working.

815
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:52,096
Besides...

816
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:54,690
I'm not sure your family
would have been too happy

817
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:57,280
to see you entertaining a
woman with a black daughter.

818
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:59,852
This isn't the old days, Sara Kate.

819
01:11:59,902 --> 01:12:01,015
Think you sister
knows that.

820
01:12:01,062 --> 01:12:03,268
Aw, hell, can't go by Mary Ellen.

821
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:07,470
Mary Ellen thinks she pretty uppity-crusty
now that she married herself some money.

822
01:12:08,163 --> 01:12:11,152
A year ago just to pay the rent, she
worked as hard as a damned nigger woman.

823
01:12:11,302 --> 01:12:12,366
WHAT?

824
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,226
- I'm sorry.
- Not the old day, huh?

825
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:25,302
Wait, don't go away, please.

826
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,876
- I've gotta get...
- No, no, stay.

827
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:32,309
- Let go of me!
- Please, please, don't let me interrupt.

828
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:36,314
I just came by to drop off a present
to one of my favorite students.

829
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:38,424
Well, Claire'll be happy t' see ya.

830
01:12:38,474 --> 01:12:39,793
Yes...

831
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,840
I certainly am happy to see
you're feeling better, Mrs. Hill.

832
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:47,769
I take it the... uh...
cancer is in remission.

833
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:49,900
Cancer?
I feel fine.

834
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:52,737
Oh... well...

835
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,986
then you might want to let Clover
come to school every once in a while.

836
01:12:57,036 --> 01:13:00,300
What are you talking about? I take her
to school myself, every morning.

837
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:01,381
Really?

838
01:13:02,768 --> 01:13:06,603
Well, did... did you know she hasn't
been in school for the past two weeks.

839
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:30,068
Okay, Everleen,
I've put up with a lot from you!

840
01:13:30,218 --> 01:13:33,318
I've put up with your
coldness, your rudeness,

841
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:36,104
- your suspicion, your voodoo...
- Voodoo?

842
01:13:36,154 --> 01:13:38,457
But when it comes to Clover,
you've gone too far!

843
01:13:38,507 --> 01:13:40,077
I've gone too far?

844
01:13:40,127 --> 01:13:42,322
You're the one come down here
actin' all high and mighty

845
01:13:42,372 --> 01:13:45,298
tryin' to buy the child's
affection with bicycles.

846
01:13:45,348 --> 01:13:47,681
Bicycle!
One bicycle!

847
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:50,035
- Damn it!
- Don't you cuss at me.

848
01:13:50,085 --> 01:13:51,879
Don't you go accusing me of
trying to steal your land.

849
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:54,183
I have worked this peach
orchard day and night.

850
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:56,135
I offered to help,
but you wouldn't let me.

851
01:13:56,211 --> 01:13:59,518
Well, how would you have time, you're so
busy tryin' to steal that child away.

852
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,605
When she ran away from
your house, she ran to me.

853
01:14:01,655 --> 01:14:04,806
Of course she did, with you buyin'
her buying bicycles, all the time.

854
01:14:04,856 --> 01:14:09,004
A bicycle! One bicycle! She's a kid,
she's supposed to play once in a while.

855
01:14:09,054 --> 01:14:12,196
You have her down here working all day long
and I don't even get a chance to see her.

856
01:14:12,246 --> 01:14:15,322
Me? You're the one that has the
child locked up in the house.

857
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:16,752
I can put up with all of that...

858
01:14:17,355 --> 01:14:20,601
but lying, so you can keep her out
of school to work for you here.

859
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:23,089
- I mean, really, that is low!
- Wait a minute!

860
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,339
- Wait a minute!
- And WRONG!

861
01:14:25,389 --> 01:14:27,988
And if you needed a worker,
I offered to help you!

862
01:14:28,038 --> 01:14:30,940
Now! Wait a minute!
What are you talkin' about?

863
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:33,579
I'm talking about the letters
you're writing to school,

864
01:14:33,629 --> 01:14:36,633
saying that Clover has to stay
home to take care of her sick mother

865
01:14:36,683 --> 01:14:38,950
I didn't write any letters.

866
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,850
You haven't written any letters

867
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:46,661
saying that Clover has to stay
home because I have cancer?

868
01:14:46,711 --> 01:14:48,735
Will you listen to yourself?

869
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:54,751
She hasn't been down
here working with you?

870
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:56,686
- I thought she was with you.
- I thought she was with you.

871
01:15:02,688 --> 01:15:07,400
Oh!!!
We have been had!

872
01:15:08,488 --> 01:15:11,003
- Sorry.
- Well, you should be.

873
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:15,053
How could you believe that I would do
anything to keep that child out of school?

874
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:17,798
Well, it doesn't help with you
practicing that voodoo against me.

875
01:15:17,848 --> 01:15:19,295
I beg your pardon!

876
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,511
Just because I'm a black woman,
does not mean I am practicing voodoo.

877
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:25,161
Now, I am a god-fearing,
church-going woman.

878
01:15:25,211 --> 01:15:28,889
- I know, I know.
- Where did you get an idea like that?

879
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:33,675
- Clover said you threw the bones.
<i>- And you believed her?

880
01:15:34,314 --> 01:15:36,425
You know, you're lettin' that
child get totally out of control.

881
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:38,606
She comes out the house
dressed in God knows what.

882
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:40,033
You think I let her
go out that way?

883
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,501
Well, that's what she said.

884
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,564
And you believed her?

885
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:46,511
Excuse me,
is this painting for sale?

886
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:50,988
It certainly is.

887
01:15:51,038 --> 01:15:53,000
I just made an offer of
fifty dollars for it.

888
01:15:53,575 --> 01:15:55,085
Well, I'm prepared to better that offer.

889
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:58,253
Seventy-five, if the artist
is an authentic primitive.

890
01:15:58,562 --> 01:16:03,361
- I beg your pardon?
- He wants to know if the painter's black.

891
01:16:04,322 --> 01:16:06,435
Primitive paintings are getting
valuable again, I guess.

892
01:16:06,485 --> 01:16:10,845
Well, I don't know if the painter
is an authentic primitive,

893
01:16:10,895 --> 01:16:12,964
but I can tell you this...

894
01:16:13,464 --> 01:16:16,005
it was painted by a
member of my family.

895
01:16:16,495 --> 01:16:18,141
Great, I'll take it

896
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:20,135
There's eighty.

897
01:16:21,572 --> 01:16:23,088
Wow! It's still wet.

898
01:16:23,532 --> 01:16:28,648
Yeah, like the sign says, we've got
the freshest peaches in the county.

899
01:16:28,803 --> 01:16:30,911
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

900
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:35,407
- White people.
- Now, what am I supposed to do with this?

901
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,025
Haven't you ever
sold a peach before?

902
01:16:37,075 --> 01:16:40,794
Not for seventy-five dollars.
How fast can you paint peaches?

903
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:44,352
What are we gonna
do about that girl?

904
01:16:46,012 --> 01:16:49,821
- Can you come to dinner tonight?
- Clover says you're a terrible cook.

905
01:16:53,832 --> 01:16:55,318
And you believe her?

906
01:16:58,557 --> 01:17:00,529
Are you invitin' Chase Porter?

907
01:17:03,454 --> 01:17:05,209
Now, Everleen,
you know better than that...

908
01:17:05,652 --> 01:17:07,844
this is going to
be a family dinner.

909
01:17:11,615 --> 01:17:13,124
Okay.

910
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:19,629
Are you sure they won't
know you did the cooking?

911
01:17:19,879 --> 01:17:24,627
I'm withholding some of the
ingredients, they'll think it was you.

912
01:17:25,519 --> 01:17:27,027
Auntie Katie.

913
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:35,474
- Hi, Clover.
- We've been waiting grace for you.

914
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,780
What are you all doing here?

915
01:17:39,936 --> 01:17:43,674
Can't we have a quiet, family
meal without havin' to explain it?

916
01:17:43,724 --> 01:17:44,708
No!

917
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,901
Please say grace, Jim Ed.

918
01:17:56,183 --> 01:18:01,298
Heavenly Father, we<i> want to thank you once
again for the bounty you've given our family,

919
01:18:01,888 --> 01:18:04,771
<i>and allowing us to share it
</i>together under this roof,

920
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:08,152
and we thank you for the
love of our departed brother,

921
01:18:08,202 --> 01:18:12,257
husband, and dear friend,
whose spirit resides here with us.

922
01:18:12,307 --> 01:18:15,930
<i>We say these things
in Jesus' name. Amen.

923
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:20,770
- Who cooked this?
- I did.

924
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:24,599
- No you didn't.
<i>- Where are your manners, Clover?

925
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:27,320
This is a beautiful meal, Sara Kate.

926
01:18:28,472 --> 01:18:31,918
There are a lot of cookbooks out
there, if you can read, you can cook.

927
01:18:33,573 --> 01:18:38,480
Have you been reading anything
interesting in school these days, Clover?

928
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:41,227
You know, just the usual.

929
01:18:41,277 --> 01:18:42,834
Pass the potatoes.

930
01:18:43,054 --> 01:18:44,918
You've been doing a nice job
with the house, Sara Kate.

931
01:18:44,968 --> 01:18:48,009
- Thank you, Gideon.
- What have you been reading in school, Clover?

932
01:18:49,105 --> 01:18:50,379
Just dumb stuff.

933
01:18:50,429 --> 01:18:53,223
And if you need any help with the rain
gutters, you know I can always help out.

934
01:18:53,273 --> 01:18:55,292
<i>I haven't seen much of you
at the peach shed, Clover,

935
01:18:55,318 --> 01:18:57,677
what've you been doing
with yourself after school?

936
01:18:57,727 --> 01:19:01,080
Miss Kenny keeps me a lot...
after school.

937
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,348
<i>- Well, that's interesting news.
- Pass the beans.

938
01:19:02,543 --> 01:19:06,066
<i>Because I ran into</i> Miss Kenny today and she
said she hasn't been keeping you after school.

939
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:07,962
Oh, pass the gravy.

940
01:19:09,325 --> 01:19:11,591
She said you haven't been at
school for the past two weeks.

941
01:19:11,641 --> 01:19:12,585
Pass the peas.

942
01:19:13,301 --> 01:19:15,750
- You mean you been cuttin' school all this time?
- Let her be.

943
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:18,813
Where have you been, Clover?
What have you been doing?

944
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,690
Pass the corn.,
pass the salt.

945
01:19:20,764 --> 01:19:21,802
Now that you have all the food,

946
01:19:21,852 --> 01:19:23,127
would you care to tell
us what you've been

947
01:19:23,177 --> 01:19:25,278
doin' with yourself
for the past two weeks?

948
01:19:25,867 --> 01:19:27,841
When did you get on her side?

949
01:19:27,891 --> 01:19:32,290
When I found out you were
using me as an excuse to cut school.

950
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,148
Damn, I'm disappointed in you.

951
01:19:34,706 --> 01:19:36,179
What would Gaten say?

952
01:19:36,786 --> 01:19:39,317
- I'm sick of Gaten!
- Now, Girl!

953
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:40,815
And you have been lying to me

954
01:19:40,865 --> 01:19:42,971
- all this time
- I have NOT been lying!

955
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:44,953
- Now...
- I haven't been lying,

956
01:19:45,003 --> 01:19:46,658
I told you the first day,
I told you,

957
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,554
I'm not gifted, I'm not talented.

958
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:51,909
<i>The only reason I'm in</i> that
class is because Gaten's dead.

959
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:55,250
I cannot do the work, and I'm
NOT going back to that school.

960
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:56,147
Clover.

961
01:19:57,013 --> 01:19:58,083
Clover.

962
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:00,745
Clover!

963
01:20:01,008 --> 01:20:02,054
Clover?

964
01:20:02,104 --> 01:20:03,863
- Should we...
- Just keep your seat.

965
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:05,305
Have some more peas.

966
01:20:07,206 --> 01:20:09,337
I told you to leave
my room alone!

967
01:20:11,985 --> 01:20:14,187
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

968
01:20:14,237 --> 01:20:16,011
You won't believe
me if I tell.

969
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,406
Where have you been, Clover?

970
01:20:17,456 --> 01:20:21,326
I've been in the woods talking to Gaten but
he's not there and I can't find him anymore.

971
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:24,363
<i>Well, of course he's not,</i> do you think Gaten
would do anything to keep you out of school?

972
01:20:24,413 --> 01:20:26,959
<i>- I won't go back there.</i>
- What happened at school, Clover?

973
01:20:27,009 --> 01:20:30,747
They wanted me to write this composition.
I told them I can't write this composition.

974
01:20:30,797 --> 01:20:33,360
- And nobody's listening to me.
<i>- I'll help you.

975
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:35,539
No, you can't nobody can.

976
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:37,245
What is it, Clover,
what is it?

977
01:20:37,925 --> 01:20:39,379
You want to know what
my composition is?

978
01:20:39,429 --> 01:20:41,699
It's: What I Did on My Summer Vacation.

979
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:43,575
And while everybody else
is getting up and saying,

980
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,711
"I went camping",
"I went on a fishing trip",

981
01:20:45,761 --> 01:20:47,181
I'm gonna have to get up and say,

982
01:20:47,231 --> 01:20:49,694
"I buried my father",
"I got a new mother",

983
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:51,770
- She's white, she can't cook good,
- Go ahead.

984
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,031
<i>- She likes salads,</i>
- Good, go ahead.

985
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:56,016
and she's gonna marry a white guy
who's got a jock for a daughter,

986
01:20:56,066 --> 01:20:58,300
<i>and she's gonna
forget my father.

987
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,390
<i>I'm gonna be the only
one who remembers him,

988
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,405
and everybody goes on
like nothing happened,

989
01:21:02,455 --> 01:21:04,774
and everything that was
supposed to happen, didn't,

990
01:21:04,824 --> 01:21:06,791
and everything that wasn't
supposed to happen, did!

991
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:08,747
<i>- What should have happened?</i>
- No, I'm not gonna...

992
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:10,185
<i>What wasn't supposed to happen?

993
01:21:10,235 --> 01:21:13,080
The wrong person died,
<i> the wrong person died in the crash.

994
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,996
Go ahead, say it, say it
and have done with it.

995
01:21:15,046 --> 01:21:17,053
I don't mind, who should have
died in that car accident?

996
01:21:17,103 --> 01:21:18,548
Me!!

997
01:21:18,606 --> 01:21:19,967
I shoulda died!

998
01:21:20,264 --> 01:21:22,171
It was my job to
take care of Gaten.

999
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:27,438
- I didn't die.
<i>- You!</i> I thought you wanted me.

1000
01:21:27,488 --> 01:21:29,417
Not everything
is about you!

1001
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:32,167
It's okay, it's okay, cry, let it go.

1002
01:21:32,217 --> 01:21:33,492
I don't want to let it go

1003
01:21:33,839 --> 01:21:35,616
Everything is changing...

1004
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,734
and I can't stop it.

1005
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:43,284
I tried to stop it,
I tried to stop me.

1006
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:45,733
But I can't.

1007
01:21:47,882 --> 01:21:49,594
I'm too scared to go to Gaten.

1008
01:21:49,644 --> 01:21:51,362
Now, you listen to me.

1009
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:54,272
Your father does not want you
to die, he wants you to live,

1010
01:21:54,322 --> 01:21:57,664
he told me that, he told me he didn't want
to die himself and he feels bad that he left you.

1011
01:21:57,714 --> 01:22:00,622
Do you hear me!
He wants you to live.

1012
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,587
Gaten?

1013
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:14,210
Gaten?

1014
01:22:17,144 --> 01:22:18,547
I miss you.

1015
01:22:20,785 --> 01:22:22,959
<i>I tried to go with you.

1016
01:22:27,382 --> 01:22:29,166
But I can't.

1017
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:34,290
I have to live, Gaten.

1018
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:41,168
I don't want to.

1019
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:45,779
<i>I'm sorry, Gaten.

1020
01:22:46,234 --> 01:22:48,227
Bought me a new bike, Gaten.

1021
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,718
But I don't want a new bike.

1022
01:22:58,736 --> 01:23:01,895
I want you, Gaten,
I want you.

1023
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:08,335
<i>They started school without you.

1024
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:12,857
But I don't know
how to stop them.

1025
01:23:17,181 --> 01:23:19,045
I tried.

1026
01:23:20,186 --> 01:23:21,667
But I can't.

1027
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:25,184
<i>I can't.

1028
01:23:27,704 --> 01:23:30,681
I can't, I can't.

1029
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:33,567
I can't,
I can't.

1030
01:23:33,617 --> 01:23:35,484
- It's gonna be okay.
- I can't.

1031
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:36,731
<i>I can't.

1032
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:39,609
<i>It's gonna be okay, Clover.

1033
01:23:41,813 --> 01:23:43,768
<i>Gaten knows
it'll soon be over.

1034
01:23:46,178 --> 01:23:47,800
Don't ya, Gaten.

1035
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,450
Oh... yes...

1036
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:54,484
he wants you to live.

1037
01:24:00,257 --> 01:24:01,590
Do you know what I think?

1038
01:24:04,042 --> 01:24:06,573
I think that's gonna be
one hell of a composition.

1039
01:24:14,373 --> 01:24:15,818
You ready for some dinner?

1040
01:24:17,378 --> 01:24:18,733
Who cooked that dinner?

1041
01:24:20,002 --> 01:24:21,298
Aunt Katie.

1042
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:26,612
I'll be right along.

1043
01:24:32,115 --> 01:24:34,910
That is quite a woman
inside that little girl, Gaten.

1044
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:39,329
Quite a woman.

1045
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,975
Yeah, I look forward to knowing her.

1046
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:49,533
She can't finish grieving as
long as you're here, Gaten.

1047
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:53,809
It's time for you to go.

1048
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,041
I'm sorry...

1049
01:25:01,455 --> 01:25:03,156
but it's time for you to go.

1050
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:18,727
Oh...

1051
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:24,164
Now, how did you find your way all
the way over here from my house?

1052
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:29,081
<i>It's okay, Gaten,</i>
we're all gonna be fine.

1053
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,162
<i>Oh, don't be afraid of goin',

1054
01:25:35,413 --> 01:25:37,018
besides...

1055
01:25:38,378 --> 01:25:40,767
you have t' get a
place ready for me.

1056
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,373
<i>Now, I wanna tell you all one thing,

1057
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,494
You needn't look for me
to come back and visit.

1058
01:25:51,105 --> 01:25:54,012
I've worked hard in this life.

1059
01:25:54,062 --> 01:25:56,578
I intend to sleep
through the next.

1060
01:26:01,805 --> 01:26:05,179
<i>Talk to The Good Lord
about rain for The Orchard.

1061
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,244
I will.

1062
01:26:11,201 --> 01:26:12,949
Watch out for the bees.

1063
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,629
<i>Marryin' that white girl wasn't the
brightest idea you ever had, Gaten, but...

1064
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,338
we'll keep her in line.

1065
01:26:22,359 --> 01:26:24,907
I'm never gonna look behind me, Gaten.

1066
01:26:26,737 --> 01:26:28,509
Never again.

1067
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,339
I'm just always gonna
know you're there.

1068
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:35,897
Good girl.

1069
01:26:41,945 --> 01:26:43,227
Well...

1070
01:26:45,673 --> 01:26:46,569
...bye.

1071
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:20,030
I love you, Gaten Hill,
I love you.

1072
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,599
- Till death do us part.
- Longer.

1073
01:27:23,553 --> 01:27:25,086
Much longer.

1074
01:27:25,136 --> 01:27:28,641
Promise me something, Gaten,
promise you'll never leave me.

1075
01:27:29,108 --> 01:27:30,364
I promise.

1076
01:27:30,716 --> 01:27:32,441
Won't even go to work anymore.

1077
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:34,746
Let 'em find a new
principal for the school.

1078
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:40,705
I love you so much.

1079
01:27:42,002 --> 01:27:43,521
I love you so much.

1080
01:27:47,891 --> 01:27:49,703
Goodbye, Sara Kate.

1081
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,813

1082
01:27:55,818 --> 01:27:57,177
