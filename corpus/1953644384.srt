2
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,413
What are you doing?

3
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:45,902
Nothing.

4
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,738
Tell me what you're doing.

5
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:53,609
Setting up these speakers
my friend Mike gave me.

6
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:56,190
- Can I help?
- No.

7
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,156
- C'mon please?
- No!

8
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,525
- Why not?
- Because.

9
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:05,297
- Just fuck off and leave me alone!
- Mom!

10
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:07,494
What?

11
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:09,863
What are you doing?

12
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,463
- Can I please help you?
- Quit fucking hitting me!

13
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:17,635
- Please?
- No!

14
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:20,636
- Mom!
- Alright, fine.

15
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:25,541
- What do you need me to do?
- Help me lift the TV up.

16
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,166
Why do we need to move the TV?

17
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,167
Because I have to get in there
and drill a hole in the back.

18
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:31,969
It's heavy!

19
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,039
What do we do now?

20
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,582
Help me lift this.

21
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,502
Alright, now pass me the drill.

22
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,836
- No I want to drill.
- Give me the fucking drill.

23
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,039
- I want to drill.
- Give me the drill, alright?

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,841
- No
- Quit fucking around, give me the drill!

25
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:57,308
No!

26
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:58,258
- Gimme...
- Mom!

27
00:01:58,258 --> 00:01:59,345
Alright.

28
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:03,671
- In the middle, right here.
- Okay.

29
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,138
It's not working...

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,204
Oh my god.

31
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:24,713
Are you sure you're
doing it right?

32
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:33,904
- Just push it through!
- I'm trying!

33
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:37,741
- Give me the fucking drill.
- Okay.

34
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,596
Just give it to me,
stop screwing around.

35
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:48,579
Fuck, it's in reverse.

36
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,499
Ow, my eye!

37
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,181
I didn't mean to!
Are you ok?

38
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,900
I didn't mean to, it's okay.

39
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:05,516
- What hap- Marc! Jesus!
- I was setting up these
speakers and drilling a hole

40
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,907
- and he was right there...
- Okay, lets go, lets go!

41
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,331
I don't know
what you were thinking.

42
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,128
It wasn't even my fault,
I don't understand why you blame

43
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:16,788
- everything on me.
- Then whose fault is it?

44
00:03:16,788 --> 00:03:18,755
- It wasn't mine! I was
setting up these speakers-

45
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:20,524
You don't give
an eleven year-old a power tool!

46
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,225
I was setting up these speakers
that I got, and he wanted to help,

47
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:23,860
- and he kept bothering me-
- Thanks for the speakers by the
way, great thinking-

48
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,330
- You're welcome! I mean the place is
a fucking shit hole and I was just trying to-

49
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,366
- Do not call our place a shit hole!
- It's a fucking shit hole!

50
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,087
Don't smile!

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,568
I'm working my ass off!

52
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:33,867
Well work harder.

53
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:40,188
Oh, this is funny?
You need to grow up.

54
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,365
Hello, Stephen.

55
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,831
- Hello.

56
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

57
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,169
You are very lucky.

58
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,807
His eye was scratched
pretty good.

59
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:58,746
He's got a lacerated cornea.

60
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:03,181
Luckily, the drill
barely touched his eye.

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,853
Now, the scar will be there
forever,

62
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:10,488
but it's nothing that
won't hear it on it's own. Ok?

63
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,215
- So... are we going to be
seeing a lot of you?

64
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,182
Well, yes.

65
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:19,065
Are we going to have all these
repeat treatments for this, cornea, or...

66
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:21,607
He'll have to come in a
few times for check-ups, and

67
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:24,762
even after the patch comes off
we'll want to monitor the

68
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:27,815
scar, just to make sure
things are healing properly.

69
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,240
It's quite normal.

70
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:35,932
Stephen, can you go
outside for a bit?

71
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,117
Okay.

72
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:48,556
I was... I just...

73
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:54,672
I'm wondering, if you have any idea
how much this is going to cost me?

74
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,903
<i>Yeah I got this scheme</i>
<i>to get the girls...</i>

75
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:35,218
<i>I go where they all,</i>
<i>ya know, flock together...</i>

76
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:40,054
<i>and then I break out my violin
and I play something real romantic</i>

77
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:41,182
<i>Really?</i>

78
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:44,248
<i>If you don't got someone</i>
<i>to fuck you got to go looking</i>

79
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:47,089
<i>- for one, ya know?</i>
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>

80
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,666
<i>Ever been to one of</i>
<i>those those uh-</i>

81
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:53,179
<i>"Social Nights" over at the</i>
<i>community center, have you?</i>

82
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:56,080
Uh no, I don't know
about those.

83
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,401
Well, maybe you're a little
too young for that.

84
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:07,008
It's mostly older girls, like
divorcees and widows and shit...

85
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:07,843
Mhmm.

86
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:11,785
- Yeah it's a total trip.
- I bet.

87
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,761
When I was your age,
I had a girl.

88
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,654
What was her name?

89
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,288
Her name was Crystal.

90
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:29,366
She'd fuck me any way I wanted.
Whenever I wanted.

91
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,148
Yeah.

92
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,316
How's your eye feel?

93
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:41,449
Fine.

94
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,255
Can you see alright?

95
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,755
Yeah.

96
00:07:48,314 --> 00:07:51,289
What do you have
going on at school?

97
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,258
It's summer school, no
one cares. It's stupid.

98
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:58,310
Well I have to work every day,
and Marc's working all summer,

99
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,115
so you're not staying here
watching TV every day.

100
00:08:01,115 --> 00:08:04,149
Everyone's going to
laugh at my eye patch.

101
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:07,622
You want me
to call them?

102
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:10,212
- I don't want you to call.
I can deal with it.

103
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,391
What's your teachers name?

104
00:08:11,396 --> 00:08:13,625
Ms. Moss.

105
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:47,932
Number three?

106
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:50,249
They can
propose laws.

107
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,178
Right, they can propose laws.

108
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:55,670
So not only do they have
the right to do away with a law,

109
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,804
they also have
the right to suggest a law.

110
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,687
Okay.

111
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,991
Who can give me three
responsibilities of the Judicial Branch?

112
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,422
Yes.

113
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:08,457
They have control
over the Supreme Court?

114
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:09,923
That's right.

115
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:20,626
Control over Supreme
Court. Anyone else?

116
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:26,033
- Stephen, how about you
-Huh?

117
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,567
What did I just say?

118
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:36,794
Stephen, can you
come to the front please?

119
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:46,846
Thank you, now, I want you to do
me and your classmates a favor-

120
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:49,380
I want you to tell everyone
what happened to your eye,

121
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,760
so they can stop wondering
and start paying attention.

122
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,528
I was helping my brother
and I hurt it.

123
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,453
Ok, and how did you hurt it?

124
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,086
A drill.

125
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:00,843
I'm sorry?

126
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:02,843
A drill went into my eye.

127
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:10,940
Thank you. Have a seat.

128
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,869
Okay.

129
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:14,253
<i>Hey Sheryl,</i>
<i>how's it going?</i>

130
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:17,611
<i>Hi, I'm just</i>
<i>about done, sorry.</i>

131
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,178
<i>No worries,</i>
<i>take your time.</i>

132
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,269
We actually thought we
were going to be here earlier

133
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,350
but we're a little late.
Sorry about that.

134
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,464
- That's alright.
- Cheque for you?

135
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:33,405
That'd be great.

136
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:40,718
How was your day today?

137
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,358
It was good, thanks.

138
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:49,637
Alright well, there
you go, thanks very much.

139
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:52,872
- It looks great.
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

140
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,073
Sure.

141
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:51,415
<i>I smoke.</i>

142
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:54,836
<i>Dude some of my friends</i>
<i>smoke weed and I want to try it soon</i>

143
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,073
<i>My friend- my</i>
<i>friends mom and dad,</i>

144
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,279
<i>both of them did it.</i>

145
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,302
<i>They were smoking,</i>

146
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,873
<i>They caught the couch on fire!</i>

147
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:05,884
<i>Have you ever looked</i>
<i>at one of these before?</i>

148
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,022
Have you ever looked
at one of these before?

149
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:09,821
No.

150
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,955
Here.

151
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,727
So damn hot out here, man.

152
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,109
Why are you guys
in summer school?

153
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:17,267
Didn't read the books.

154
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:20,873
My- my- my mom just
put me in here-

155
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,483
Shut the fuck up.

156
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,556
Hey!

157
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,823
You cannot be on this roof!

158
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,704
Get over here!

159
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,075
The rest of you have until the
count of three to get over here.

160
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:43,313
Stephen!

161
00:13:44,472 --> 00:13:46,552
You could get
in a lot of trouble for this!

162
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:48,385
I know.

163
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,264
I'm sorry.

164
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:06,443
Nice eye patch.

165
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:07,976
Thanks.

166
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:16,882
You look like a pirate,
kind of.

167
00:14:16,882 --> 00:14:20,283
Thanks, I know.

168
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:23,320
What's it like?

169
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,355
What do you mean?

170
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:28,565
Well, do you only see
half of everything?

171
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:31,166
I pretty much see everything.

172
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:12,330
So what do you
think of this place?

173
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,774
It's really cool.

174
00:15:16,774 --> 00:15:18,507
Yeah it's pretty neat.

175
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,586
So, you got a boyfriend?

176
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,892
No.

177
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,327
Why not?

178
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,124
Don't want one.

179
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,557
Well, you think maybe
I could be your boyfriend?

180
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,264
No.

181
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,447
Why not?

182
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,789
I don't know...

183
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,260
I've never had
a boyfriend before.

184
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,731
Well I've had a few girlfriends.

185
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,215
What did you guys do together?

186
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:35,829
You know, just hung out at
school, went to the movies,

187
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,102
nothing too big.

188
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,162
Will everyone know?

189
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:47,154
Well, I guess.

190
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,356
Is that bad?

191
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:54,191
No, but,
my parents wouldn't like it.

192
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,846
Well we could just keep it
a secret for now.

193
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:06,876
So you want me to be
your girlfriend?

194
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:07,942
Yeah.

195
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,294
Okay.

196
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,741
Okay.

197
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,547
Cop hold? Huh?

198
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:50,421
Oh fuck!

199
00:17:58,793 --> 00:18:02,645
One! Two! Three!

200
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:58,613
Hi, how are you doing?

201
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,312
Doing alright, how are you?

202
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:02,081
I'm fine, good.

203
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,216
I'm just getting
ready to leave, actually-

204
00:20:04,218 --> 00:20:06,648
Oh, damn, I'm sorry to hear that.

205
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:08,613
Thanks.
You have a good night.

206
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,223
Thanks, maybe I'll see you
again next time.

207
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,612
You fuckin' her yet?

208
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:25,113
Uh, no not yet, but I
mean, we're moving pretty fast.

209
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:28,274
No you haven't,
I can tell.

210
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:31,652
You want her to put out, you
gotta give her something nice.

211
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:34,492
Like jewelry or some shit.

212
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:37,102
Why do you say that?

213
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:39,134
Girls are suckers
for that.

214
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:43,917
You give her some jewelry,
she'll put out, trust me.

215
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,066
Am I doing it right?

216
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,116
Yeah, yeah,
you're fine.

217
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,696
Is something wrong?

218
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:21,929
No.

219
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:25,137
I can tell
that something's wrong.

220
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,837
Nothing's wrong.

221
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,614
Do you want to do
something else?

222
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,000
No, you're fine.

223
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,743
Do you want me to do
something else?

224
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:46,067
Well

225
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,653
I mean, just, ya know, an idea-

226
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:53,075
Yeah, go ahead-

227
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:55,616
Could you use your mouth?

228
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:01,237
I've never-

229
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:04,018
It's just an idea,
you don't have to.

230
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:13,225
Do you want me to? Do you really
want me to do that?

231
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,136
Yeah of course.

232
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:22,773
Would it feel good for you?

233
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,410
Yeah, definitely.

234
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,312
Okay well, you have to
tell me when.

235
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,548
Because I don't want
to taste it.

236
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:37,389
Of course.

237
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:40,353
Do you promise me?

238
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:43,788
Yeah I promise,
of course.

239
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,785
Do you pinky-promise me?

240
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:48,124
Pinky-promise.

241
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:51,788
Okay.

242
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,067
Look at that car!
That's a piece of shit!

243
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,117
I bet that's your car, Stephen!

244
00:24:21,117 --> 00:24:24,118
<i>That was the weakest throw
I've ever seen.</i>

245
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,643
Nice!

246
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,808
Yeah!

247
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:36,465
Come on guys!

248
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:47,073
We can do
better than this!

249
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:54,086
That close up,
you can't do nothin'!

250
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:56,889
You can't
do any better!

251
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:02,294
Nice throw,
you weakling!

252
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:05,818
Come on guys, watch this!

253
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,786
What the fuck you doing?

254
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:22,493
Whatcha gonna do about it?

255
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:39,671
What should I write?

256
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:40,772
What should he write?

257
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:41,772
"Fag"

258
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,441
Write "fag", Stephen!

259
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:44,809
Yeah!

260
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:47,162
I bet he can't
even spell "fag"!

261
00:25:50,118 --> 00:25:51,785
That's what he is!

262
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,323
He can't spell his name!

263
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,769
Hey, you know what
a blow-job is?

264
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:37,341
It's when a girl
puts it in her mouth.

265
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,279
What does it feel like?

266
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:44,933
Pretty good. My girlfriend does
it whenever I want.

267
00:26:45,582 --> 00:26:47,156
You have a girlfriend?

268
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,736
Don't tell Mom.

269
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:50,468
Why not?

270
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:52,502
Don't fucking tell her!

271
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:33,516
<i>I think I love you.</i>

272
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,009
<i>You love me?</i>

273
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:37,677
<i>Yeah.</i>

274
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,122
Are you in love with me?

275
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:42,351
<i>Yeah, is that bad?</i>

276
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:47,219
<i>I'm just not ready yet.</i>

277
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,186
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you're not ready?</i>

278
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:53,119
<i>I can't.</i>

279
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:55,723
<i>Well, when are you</i>
<i>going to be ready?</i>

280
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,140
<i>If you love me then</i>
<i>there's no rush.</i>

281
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,618
<i>People who love
each other have sex.</i>

282
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:03,541
<i>That's what happens.</i>

283
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:09,118
I'm just not ready.

284
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,308
Well when are you
going to be ready?

285
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:11,870
I'm getting tired of waiting.

286
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,004
I just want you so bad,
is that wrong?

287
00:29:15,476 --> 00:29:17,279
No.

288
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,121
Well then I don't see
what the problem is.

289
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:24,866
I heard it hurts.

290
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:26,801
It doesn't hurt.

291
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,860
For girls it does.

292
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,542
No it doesn't, it feels great!

293
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,087
How would you know?

294
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:33,977
I just do.

295
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:37,477
<i>Will you just please tell me</i>
<i>when you're going to be ready?</i>

296
00:29:38,703 --> 00:29:40,632
<i>I don't know.</i>

297
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:18,359
Mom?

298
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:20,107
Yeah?

299
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,759
Can I have some money?

300
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:26,031
What do you need money for?

301
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,747
I don't know,
I could just really use some.

302
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:34,821
Well, you have a job, you
could use that money.

303
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:38,931
Yeah, well I could have enough
if I waited all summer but, I need it now.

304
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,828
Well, you should know,
as an adult if you...

305
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:49,490
spend money you don't have,
it puts you in a bad situation.

306
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:53,456
Please can I just have the money

307
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:55,769
and I'll pay you back as soon as I
get it from my work?

308
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:02,920
How much do you need?

309
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,472
Maybe, two hundred?

310
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,979
What the hell do you
need two hundred dollars for?

311
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,335
I want to get something
for my girlfriend.

312
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,570
Well I don't have
two hundred dollars.

313
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:28,974
So I can't give you
anything I don't have...

314
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:33,529
You can save the money,
then buy whatever it is this

315
00:31:33,532 --> 00:31:36,629
thing you want with your own
money.

316
00:31:42,688 --> 00:31:43,524
Mom?

317
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:44,857
Yeah?

318
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:47,259
Can I have
some money too?

319
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:50,657
No one's getting any money!

320
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:51,859
But I need some...

321
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:55,110
Okay, shut up! Eat your food.

322
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,819
Okay, seven basic
principles of the Constitution,

323
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:08,722
can anyone name one?

324
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:12,691
- Yes.
- Freedom of speech?

325
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:17,501
Freedom of speech, yes, but what
principle does that fall under?

326
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:19,503
Individual rights?

327
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:23,239
That's right,
individual rights.

328
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:27,712
Can someone
name another one?

329
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:32,179
There's one in particular that
I'm looking for- yes?

330
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:33,386
Separation of power?

331
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:36,288
There you go,
separation of power.

332
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:43,474
The reason I was looking for
this one

333
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:46,425
 is because we just
covered this the other day.

334
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,925
Who can give me
a third basic principle?

335
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,781
Stephen, can you stay
for a minute, please?

336
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:07,194
Can you come over here?

337
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:15,769
Everyone else, don't forget
your homework for tomorrow.

338
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:36,728
Okay, first of all,
you're not in trouble.

339
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,731
But I just wanted to talk to you
for a second,

340
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:43,107
because I've noticed that
you've been drifting in class

341
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,662
and you seem
a little distracted,

342
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,152
is there something on your mind?

343
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,551
No.

344
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:50,791
Is everything ok?

345
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,596
Yeah.

346
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,150
You're sure...

347
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,649
Yeah.

348
00:33:57,386 --> 00:34:01,222
Okay,
well how are things at home?

349
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,090
Fine.

350
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,989
That's good, what about your mom
and dad, do you guys get along-

351
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:07,956
I don't have a dad.

352
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:10,394
Well what about your brother?

353
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:13,447
You mentioned you had
a brother... how old is he?

354
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:15,256
He's turning sixteen soon.

355
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:18,568
Oh okay, is he your best friend?

356
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:20,099
No.

357
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:24,672
How's your eye?

358
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:25,963
Feels better.

359
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:26,985
That's good.

360
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:31,473
Look, Stephen,

361
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:36,184
I just want you to know that if
you ever have any questions

362
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:39,543
or you feel like you need to talk to
someone, you can come to me, okay?

363
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:41,202
Okay.

364
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,675
Yeah?

365
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,755
What are you doing?

366
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:04,936
Using the bathroom.

367
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,646
Well,
I'm going to go pick up dinner.

368
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,647
Okay.

369
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:30,328
That bitch is
pissing me off.

370
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,565
She's always yelling at me about
slacking off and everything-

371
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:38,941
Wait, Stephen, didn't she like,
make you stay after school?

372
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:41,142
Yeah, why?

373
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,535
Why, dude?

374
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:47,384
Got some nice pictures
in here.

375
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,381
We should get her back
somehow... some shit.

376
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:54,211
Maybe we could break into
her house when she's not there-

377
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,831
Nah man, shit on her car-

378
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:58,665
Pee in her garden!

379
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,482
You guys really
shouldn't get back at her,

380
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:05,852
you guys are gonna get caught...

381
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,492
Because we're the only ones
in the class that hate her-

382
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,520
Shut up, Stephen!

383
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,311
- Everybody hates her!
- If we plan it right we won't!

384
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,114
What, are you sticking up for her?

385
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:13,941
Nah I ain't sticking up for her-

386
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,074
Then why don't you
wanna go with it?

387
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,884
You guys think I can
shoot this behind my back?

388
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:23,138
Who gives a shit?

389
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:39,661
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

390
00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:41,387
- What's up?
<i>- Nothing</i>

391
00:37:41,387 --> 00:37:44,115
- So what are you doing today?
<i>- Working.</i>

392
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:47,504
Oh, well, you think
you could come over?

393
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:48,232
<i>Now?</i>

394
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,101
Yeah, just take a lunch break
or something.

395
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,561
<i>I already took it.</i>

396
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,547
Oh.

397
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:55,094
-Well, I got something for you.
<i>-What is it?</i>

398
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,654
Just something.

399
00:38:00,602 --> 00:38:02,720
<i>Tell me what it is.</i>

400
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,859
I gotta tell you in person,
you gotta come over to get it.

401
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:11,723
<i>Okay.</i>

402
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,412
Okay, alright.
I'll see you soon, alright?

403
00:38:13,412 --> 00:38:15,209
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Alright, bye.</i>

404
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,150
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hm.

405
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,271
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yeah.

406
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:20,570
Alright.

407
00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:29,846
Is it a promise ring?

408
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:33,033
Well, if you want
it to be.

409
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,872
Do you want it to be?

410
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:36,032
Yeah.

411
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,558
It's so pretty.

412
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,846
Where did you get it?

413
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:48,285
It's a family heirloom.

414
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,928
And you're giving it to me?

415
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:54,028
Yeah, I love you.

416
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:01,685
Thank you.

417
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,353
You're welcome.

418
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:12,000
Do you really love me?

419
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,633
Yeah.

420
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:19,032
I love you too.

421
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,441
Doggy, doggy, doggy!

422
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,968

We gotta do this quick!

429
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:49,394
Stephen, I want you
to look out, alright?

430
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:50,660
Okay.

431
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,316
Don't be a pussy.

432
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,782
- Keep a close eye out!

433
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,284
Gotta do this quick guys!
Come on!

Hurry up!

435
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,566
Shut up!

436
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:28,832
Guys hurry up!

437
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:31,235
It's gonna be so sweet
when I see her face.

438
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:39,478
Guys! She's here!

439
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:41,281
Hurry up!

440
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:42,349
Fuck!

441
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:43,517
Dude, come on!
She's coming!

442
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,251
Come on, Stephen!

443
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,285
Dude, come on!

444
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:46,453
Just leave him!

445
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,755
Come on!
There she is!

446
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,117
I didn't do it.

447
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:20,648
Don't lie to me, Stephen.

448
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,916
I'm not lying, I didn't do it-

449
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:22,722
Who did it?

450
00:42:22,722 --> 00:42:24,522
I don't know!

451
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,494
Leave.

452
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:31,018
Leave.

453
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:31,917
I didn't do it-

454
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:33,583
Leave!

455
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:37,638
Go!

456
00:45:00,183 --> 00:45:02,753
She keeps looking over
here, man! Tell him!

457
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,721
Look, look...

458
00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:10,104
You gonna show us
how to do it, mac-daddy?

459
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:12,526
Come on, you can do it.

460
00:45:12,526 --> 00:45:15,034
Get me some chips
while you're over there.

461
00:45:23,703 --> 00:45:26,659
Hey...
- Hey.

462
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:33,979
You want a... want a beer?
I snuck some in.

463
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,791
Sure.

464
00:45:40,378 --> 00:45:42,045
I'm Sheryl.

465
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:45,382
I'm Gabe.

00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:17,714
No, you?

470
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:19,013
No.

471
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:26,120
Do you want to dance?

472
00:46:26,122 --> 00:46:28,056

Yeah.

499
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:16,300
You want to go for a ride?

500
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:20,039
Okay.

501
00:51:36,351 --> 00:51:38,752
I have two boys.

502
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,495
I have an eleven
year-old and a fifteen year-old.

503
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:03,219
Stephen, the eleven year-old, has
a patch on his eye right now.

504
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,218
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

505
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:13,064
Marc got him in the eye
with a power drill.

506
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:19,404
How's that happen?

507
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:25,382
Stupid... I don't know.

508
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:28,595
I've never heard of that.

509
00:52:32,844 --> 00:52:34,511
You have any kids?

510
00:52:34,513 --> 00:52:36,367
No.

511
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:35,202
We could go back to my place
if you want.

512
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,984
We'll have to be quiet but...

513
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:44,443
It'd be nice to hang out.

514
00:53:45,156 --> 00:53:46,991
Yeah.

515
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:48,246
You have to stop.

516
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,781
Get off of me,
you have to stop.

517
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:57,437
I can't. I can't...

518
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,195
You have to stop,
get off of me.

519
00:55:04,195 --> 00:55:07,312
Baby I can't, just...
just hold on.

520
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,831
We have to try
and be quiet.

521
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,124
Door slams shut]

522
00:55:52,476 --> 00:55:54,510
Thank you.

523
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:26,307
We're gonna have to be quiet,
they're right in there.

524
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:46,592
They're right in there, okay?
Go upstairs.

525
00:58:22,156 --> 00:58:24,023
Fuck.

526
01:00:07,715 --> 01:00:09,116
Fuck.

527
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:19,000
Good morning.

528
01:00:19,003 --> 01:00:20,268
Hey.

529
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:24,074
You in a hurry?

530
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:26,036
I'm late.

531
01:00:26,347 --> 01:00:29,199
Can I make you some
breakfast or something?

532
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,033
I'm late!

533
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:37,539
I'm sorry, it's my second time
late this week-

534
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,107
I just...

535
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:44,057
I just wanted you to meet
Stephen and Marc, it's okay-

536
01:00:44,059 --> 01:00:45,692
Who?

537
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,117
Stephen and Marc...

538
01:00:48,117 --> 01:00:49,868
Oh, yeah, yeah.

539
01:00:51,228 --> 01:00:55,619
Look, second time late this
week, I gotta run.

540
01:00:57,072 --> 01:01:00,095
Hey, I had a good time.

541
01:01:11,587 --> 01:01:13,555
Fuck, Gabe?

542
01:01:14,023 --> 01:01:15,724
Gabe!

543
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:21,787
My car, I forgot my car.
My car is at the club.

544
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:27,267
Okay, okay, okay!
I'll be in the truck!

545
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:14,666
Hey.

546
01:04:14,669 --> 01:04:16,173
Hey.

547
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:17,408
Want some crackers?

548
01:04:17,408 --> 01:04:19,875
No thanks,
I'm good.

549
01:04:21,511 --> 01:04:22,775
How's your eye doing?

550
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:23,767
It's doing good.

551
01:04:23,767 --> 01:04:26,983
I don't even know why I have to
wear this stupid eye patch anymore.

552
01:04:26,983 --> 01:04:28,476
It doesn't
do anything.

553
01:04:28,476 --> 01:04:31,327
You should just take
it off. Who cares?

554
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,127
Okay.

555
01:04:35,063 --> 01:04:36,397
The fair's coming up...

556
01:04:36,399 --> 01:04:37,624
I know, you going?

557
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,292
Yeah, I think if my
older sister takes me.

558
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:56,179
Do you kiss girls?

559
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:58,078
Yeah, why?

560
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:02,069
I don't know.
What else have you done?

561
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:05,515
- What do you mean?
- With girls, what else?

562
01:05:05,515 --> 01:05:07,483
A lot of things.

563
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:09,413
With who?

564
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:12,998
Who have you kissed?

565
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:20,390
Do you want to
kiss me?

566
01:05:20,392 --> 01:05:21,358
Sure.

567
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,193
Well not if you
don't want to cause' it's-

568
01:05:23,195 --> 01:05:24,366
Yeah.

569
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:26,974
Okay.

570
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,854
Ready?

571
01:05:55,856 --> 01:05:57,255
Yeah.

572
01:06:03,022 --> 01:06:04,823
You want to try again?

573
01:06:04,825 --> 01:06:06,324
Sure.

574
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:14,833
You want to try again?

575
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:16,501
Sure.

576
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:52,070
Why'd you take off
your eye patch?

577
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,341
It wasn't doing
anything anymore.

578
01:06:58,244 --> 01:07:01,012
It made me
look like a pirate.

579
01:11:44,155 --> 01:11:45,000
The End

580
01:11:45,055 --> 01:11:49,055
