1
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,585
Oh, my God. Matt. Vicki just told me
about this huge party tonight.

2
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,458
- No way. Where?
- Dude, there's a huge party tonight.

3
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,930
- Cool. We crashin'?
- No, man. We're just goin'.

4
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,934
- I heard about this party tonight.
- Did you hear about that party, man?

5
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:03,436
Oh, my God. Did you hear?
Mike totally dumped Amanda.

6
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:05,938
I just heard Mike Dexter
and Amanda Beckett broke up.

7
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,908
Just broke up with Amanda.
Like, seconds ago.

8
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:12,208
What? That was totally my idea.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,271
Tell me we'll never break up.

10
00:01:17,318 --> 00:01:18,751
You're there. I'm there.

11
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,879
- Everybody's there.
- We're there !

12
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:38,098
I've had a library book out
since the third grade.

13
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:40,504
I got caught.
I'm going to community college.

14
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,805
My gown smells like blue cheese.

15
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,813
- So whose party is it?
- The girl from our French class.

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,973
- Whose party is it?
- That girl in our gym class.

17
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,210
- Oh, the one with the thighs?
- No, the one with the weird--

18
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,809
- You joined the army?
- Yeah. Serve my country, man.

19
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,287
- You know, they shave your head!
- What?

20
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,124
- I just feel so sorry for Amanda.
- You are so full of crap.

21
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,691
Hey, dude, did you hear?
I'm naked under my gown.

22
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,293
Yeah, I heard that.

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,134
How about that party?
It's gonna be huge!

24
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,673
Heard that too.

25
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:16,471
Oh, then I guess you heard
about Mike dumpin' Amanda.

26
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:19,138
- Wait. What did you say?
- Where have you been, man?

27
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:22,808
Mike Dexter broke up
with Amanda Beckett.

28
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,736
This is so perfect.

29
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:49,208
Amanda Beckett is single
and on the night of this party--

30
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:52,144
a party I'll be attending,
a party she'll be attending.

31
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,580
It's all falling into place.
It's like it's fate.

32
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,584
What? I thought we weren't
even going to this party.

33
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:01,019
Don't you wanna keep your tassel?
For $5.00, you can keep your tassel.

34
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:06,550
Yeah, then I can press it in between
my yearbook with my prom corsage.

35
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,734
What?

36
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:19,602
Nothing. I mean, nice to tell me
that you changed your plans.

37
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,142
You're only leaving tomorrow,
but, you know, whatever.

38
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,613
Denise, Amanda and I have to finish
what we started four years ago.

39
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,809
Do you know what your problem is?
It's like you're afraid to move forward.

40
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:32,079
I mean, Preston,
we are so outta here.

41
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:34,087
Now why do you wanna go
to this party tonight and look back?

42
00:03:34,155 --> 00:03:36,089
Don't look back.
You should never look back.

43
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,091
Dudes, I actually graduated!

44
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,886
- Unless you're that guy.
- I'm all right.

45
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,092
Look, all I'm saying is...

46
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,431
Amanda and I are connected.

47
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,835
We have been, ever since the first day
that she came to school.

48
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,634
Oh, God. Here we go.

49
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:54,834
It was October, freshman year.

50
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,844
First fime in history
thaf I'd ever missed the bus.

51
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:09,782
If I had arrived on time,
I never would have seen her.

52
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:17,296
But as it was, I was the first person
at Huntingfon Hills High...

53
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,856
to set eyes on Amanda Becketf.

54
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,001
It was her first day at school.

55
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:30,737
Then I'm sitting in class,
enjoying a late breakfast...

56
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,908
when suddenly, out of all the classrooms
in the entire school...

57
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,643
she walks into mine.

58
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,584
And where does the teacher sit her?

59
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,622
Right nexf to me.

60
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:47,621
Now up until now, one could
write this off to coincidence...

61
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,390
but then...

62
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:53,131
she reached into her bag...

63
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,136
and pulled out
a strawberry Pop Tart...

64
00:04:56,204 --> 00:05:00,038
the very same breakfast pastry
that I was consuming at that moment.

65
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,209
What was I to do?
How was I to proceed?

66
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:07,008
Who would like to volunteer
to give Amanda a tour of the school?

67
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,112
- I will.
- Mike Dexter.

68
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:26,691
That's where I lost her.

69
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,201
I had a clear shot, and I hesitated.

70
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,200
But fate's finally giving me
a second chance.

71
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,402
Well, have fun tonight...

72
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:38,945
and be sure to tell everyone
how much I'll miss them.

73
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:43,848
You're not gonna go?
I can't believe you're not gonna go.

74
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,011
Why would I go?

75
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:48,351
What else are you gonna do tonight?

76
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,325
I can't believe
I'm going to this party.

77
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,452
I can't believe
he broke up with her.

78
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,402
I can't believe
you broke up with her, man.

79
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:06,573
Well, it's like I always say--

80
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,758
- But Amanda is so hot, man.
- So hot, man.

81
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:28,056
Yeah, I guess,
for a high school girl.

82
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:33,328
Guys, we're gonna be in college soon.
You know who's gonna be in college?

83
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,238
Girls that used to be in high school.

84
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:41,673
Women. College women.

85
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:45,337
Women with no curfew,
women on the pill, and women--

86
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,174
Women, brol
We're starin' into the future, here!

87
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,708
And the future is women.

88
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,782
Huh, women.

89
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:05,021
Maybe we should break up
with our girlfriends too.

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,727
That would be sweet. We'd have
the whole summer to hang out together.

91
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,534
Party and get with every chick
in sight, man...

92
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,631
without our lame-ass girlfriends
hanging around us.

93
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:17,200
- Yeah, man. They suck!
- That's what I'm sayin'.

94
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:18,768
- They suck!
- That's what I'm sayin'!

95
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,939
You're right, Dex, man.

96
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:26,551
- Beth, kiss my ass!
- Yes, baby! Yesl

97
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:31,083
This is brilliant, man.
Such a good idea.

98
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:35,094
- Mike Dexter's a god.
- Mike Dexter's a role model !

99
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,557
Mike Dexter is an asshole.

100
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:56,348
For the past decade,
he has made a hobby of my pain.

101
00:07:56,417 --> 00:08:00,080
Witness exhibit "A":
My eighth grade science project--

102
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:02,088
a working rain forest...

103
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:05,023
that Mike threw out
a third floor window.

104
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:07,219
It rains here no more.

105
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:12,357
Witness exhibit "B":
An eye patch I wore for a month...

106
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,732
after Mike beaned me
with a raisin in home ec.

107
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,738
My parents took me
to a 3-D film festival.

108
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,467
I saw no third dimension.

109
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,671
And of course,
how can I forget the pudding incident?

110
00:08:24,745 --> 00:08:26,303
I know no one else has.

111
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,407
Well, gentlemen, tonight
Mike Dexter will know humiliation.

112
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:34,045
Tonight, Mike Dexter
will know ridicule.

113
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:37,454
Tonight is the night
we fight back.

114
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,187
Tonight is our independence night.

115
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:45,425
Hello?
Get this off your head.

116
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:49,367
You're actin' like-- Look,
maybe we should go over the plan again.

117
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,397
All right.
We will set up...

118
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:55,135
behind the pool house,
right there.

119
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,372
This is me,
you are Grand Moff Tarkin...

120
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:00,380
and you are Boba Fett.

121
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:03,611
-Wait. How come he gets to be Boba Fett?
-Really, it doesn't matter.

122
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,346
All right, fine. You're Boba Fett,
you're Grand Moff Tarkin.

123
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,820
- I don't wanna be Grand Moff Tarkin.
- All right. You know what? Fine.

124
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,120
You're both Kiss dolls.
You set up here.

125
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:16,027
Now, I will lead Mike
and one of his random jock friends...

126
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,689
behind the pool house to here...

127
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,392
and here...

128
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,298
where you two will be waiting.

129
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:24,235
You jump down on them,
rendering them unconscious...

130
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,535
with the chloroform
that we mixed in chem lab.

131
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,041
Then we strip off
said jocks' clothes...

132
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:34,013
and take Polaroids of them
in a lurid, naked embrace.

133
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:37,077
Geez, do you think
there'll be any girls there?

134
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:39,881
Are you kidding me?
People may even be having sex tonight.

135
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:48,693
Yo, I gotta have sex tonight.

136
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,069
I mean, peep this.
They say in here...

137
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,733
92%%% of honeys at UCLA
are sexually active.

138
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,141
92`%` of women in Los Angeles
at UCLA walking around goin'...

139
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:07,442
"Class or sex?
What shall I do?"

140
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:10,882
92`/`, yo!
You know what that means, don't you?

141
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:14,045
That means I gots a 92`%` chance
of embarrassing myself.

142
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,521
I roll up on that shortie, like,
"What's up, yo?"

143
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,582
She be like, "You don't know 20 ways
to make me call you Big Papa."

144
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,562
- 'Cause I don't, yo.
- Rest in peace.

145
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:27,123
What's up, man?

146
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:29,499
- Who be the lucky honey?
- Yo, I ain't decided yet, right.

147
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,004
But I figure all the bitches
in the class gonna be at this party.

148
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:35,303
You know, I gots to give 'em all
an equal opportunity to Special K.

149
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,310
It took me all day,
but I narrowed it down...

150
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,141
to a list of ten
very lucky finalists.

151
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:41,681
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Well, what's up, man?

152
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,649
- You wanna see? Check this out.
- Yeah.

153
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,150
Observe.

154
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:48,979
The love kit.

155
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,359
Oh, damn, man.
Our boy's a fag, yo.

156
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,861
- Who's a fag?
- Yo, both of y'all.

157
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,196
That is a fragrance
of love-scented candle, bitch. Damn.

158
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,360
Yo, you actually think
you're gonna hit this party...

159
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:05,599
packin' a pleasure chest
and some girl's just gonna give it up?

160
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:07,265
Watch me, G.

161
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,248
Wait.

162
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,648
I have the letter.

163
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:22,847
You're not gonna give her
the letter.

164
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:25,255
Why wouldn't I give her the letter?

165
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:27,385
Preston, because you haven't had
the chance to revise it...

166
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,928
for the four billionth time.

167
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:30,861
All great writers revise. What--

168
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:32,899
Dear Amanda...

169
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:35,333
Now that you're finally single...

170
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,700
I can finally give you
this sappy love letter...

171
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:42,731
that I never had the guts to give you
during all four years of high school.

172
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,108
- Listen to this.
- What?

173
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,147
This is Barry Manilow.

174
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:49,409
Yeah, I know.

175
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,646
Why do we have a radio station on
that plays Barry Manilow?

176
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,554
- Just listen to the words, Denise.
- Oh, Mandy

177
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:59,593
Amanda. Mandy. Aman--

178
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,093
Mandy's short for Amanda.

179
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:04,494
That's it. That's my sign.

180
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:09,093
I hate to interrupt this alternate
universe you've wandered into here...

181
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,729
but, like, I hear that song's
about his dog.

182
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:16,139
It's not about a dog.
It's about a woman named Amanda.

183
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,678
Who the hell
names their dog Amanda?

184
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,839
My cousin named her dog Samantha.

185
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:24,543
Look, shut up about the dog, okay?

186
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,213
- You came and you gave without faking
- That's my sign.

187
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,521
That is totally my sign.
Consider me ready.

188
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,394
Hi! Oh, my God, you guys.
Come on in.

189
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:37,521
Oh, don't let the dog out. Oh, Susan,
you look so cute. Oh, hi, Ray.

190
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:40,431
Oh, and the drinks are in the back,
okay? Oh, Preston.

191
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:43,595
I'm so glad you came,
and you brought a friend.

192
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,901
Hi. No, it's okay.

193
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,771
Just come on in.
Just, you know, drink, be happy.

194
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:52,869
Preston Meyers. Not one step further
until you sign my yearbook.

195
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:54,573
I'm gonna be the first
Huntington Hills student...

196
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,048
to get all 522 seniors to sign.

197
00:12:57,117 --> 00:13:00,416
- My, how ambitious of you.
- Don't think you're not signing either.

198
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:03,479
I saved a special space
for you to sign in the back.

199
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:05,491
Why didn't you get
your senior portrait taken?

200
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,756
Specifically to avoid moments
like this one, actually.

201
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,923
Thanks. You too.
Go, Huntington !

202
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:25,045
I almost fell out of my dress!

203
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:27,273
Let's go, boys. Time is honey.

204
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,339
Ah, yeah !

205
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,316
Cool, a key party, bro.

206
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:32,909
You look so pretty.
Oh, Christie.

207
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,614
Jessica,
thank you for coming. Kenny.

208
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,680
- What's up?
- Come on in.

209
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:41,216
Hi. Wait. You guys, no one can go
in the fancy room, okay?

210
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:43,923
I mean, seriously, my parents
are coming home on Sunday.

211
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:47,091
- Kenny Fisher, sign my yearbook.
- No, thanks. No time.

212
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,227
Come on. Where's your school spirit?
Go, Hot Dogs!

213
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:53,137
- Bitch, get a life!
- Ah, yeah !

214
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,334
We got a mad town
up in this mother.

215
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,936
Yo, shorties gonna be
linin' up to get with me.

216
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:02,470
Yo, check it.
Time to get busy.

217
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,983
Hey, yo, you think he's gonna
hizzit the skizzins?

218
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,520
Yo, man, that boy
ain't got no skills, man.

219
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,488
Watch out, guys.
Coming through here.

220
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:13,117
Hey, yo, white boy.
You better check yourself, man.

221
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:17,061
This is our first show ever.
Don't screw it up.

222
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:22,330
Yeah, look, dude. I heard Carol Brawner
invited her cousin tonight.

223
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,633
And the word is,
his brother's roommate...

224
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:28,300
knows a guy
who knows a scout in L.A.

225
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,002
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

226
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,911
Thank God we got these T-shirts
printed, huh? Yeah. Check 'em out.

227
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:44,284
Okay, we're gonna rendezvous here
at 0030 hours, all right?

228
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,993
Wait, William.
There's gonna be drinking in there.

229
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:51,224
- Yeah? So?
- So what are you gonna do?

230
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,233
They're gonna kick you out
if you don't drink.

231
00:14:54,301 --> 00:14:56,963
Well, I will be drinking.

232
00:14:57,037 --> 00:15:00,837
- But, William, you could get drunk.
- You could get addicted.

233
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,671
No. It's okay. Look.

234
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,904
I downloaded this little baby
off the net.

235
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:08,175
I will know exactly how many spirits
I may imbibe...

236
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:11,615
without affecting my judgment
or my behavior.

237
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,677
Wow. You've got every angle covered.

238
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:18,247
You know, William,
from this light...

239
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,259
you somewhat resemble
David Duchovny.

240
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,527
William, trust no one.

241
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:34,768
I am a sex machine!

242
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:40,275
Steve, make him say somethin' else.

243
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:46,747
Would you like to touch my penis?

244
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,326
Huntington Hills High,
kiss my assl

245
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:57,329
Mike Dexter,
you have to sign my yearbook.

246
00:15:57,397 --> 00:16:01,060
Which team has fhe winning play
Hunfington, Hunfington, hey, hey--

247
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:07,339
There they are.

248
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,739
Come on.

249
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,108
I missed you so much !

250
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,171
I haven't seen my boyfriend
in six hours.

251
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,274
How you doin', girls?

252
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:20,913
Dudes, remember the game plan.

253
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:24,423
What game plan?

254
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:29,589
Right. Exactly. Uh--

255
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,597
Look, Beth, we need to talk.

256
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:34,099
In fact, we all need to talk.

257
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,102
- Right, guys?
- Oh, my God. I can't believe she came.

258
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,605
Guys?

259
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:43,709
You guys.

260
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,018
There she is.

261
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:23,816
I think you made
a real connection there.

262
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,150
Oh, hey, guys.

263
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,849
- Hi.
- How are you?

264
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,357
Are you okay?

265
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:44,565
- Now look what you've done.
- Maybe we should go talk to her.

266
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:46,765
Totally. She looks destroyed.

267
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,273
Suicidal.

268
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,873
All right.

269
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:03,346
Looks like someone's auditioning
for "Soul Train."

270
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:11,155
- Do you have to rag on everybody?
- Oh, come on.

271
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:14,064
His wardrobe alone
leaves him open for public mockery.

272
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,068
I'm not the one that used
to spend the night at his house.

273
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,594
That was the fourth grade. Wanna talk
about your friends in the fourth grade?

274
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:22,540
So do you see her?
Where'd she go?

275
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,406
She's right there.

276
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:29,079
- God!
- What? She didn't see me.

277
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,413
- I can't believe you pointed at her.
- She didn't see me.

278
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,579
- Are you hyperventilating?
- No, I'm centering myself.

279
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,055
- I'm harnessing my chi.
- Your what?

280
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:40,150
I'm harnessing my chi.
Don't laugh at me.

281
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,957
- Were you this weird when we went out?
- Were you this bitchy when we went out?

282
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,520
I'm trying to think.

283
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:47,396
Yeah, I was a bitchy eighth grader
for that whole week, actually.

284
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:51,135
- What's up, Pres?
- Hey. I'm gonna do this.

285
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,138
I'm gonna go do it right now.

286
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:58,136
Are you gonna be okay?

287
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,338
Yeah. I'll get a ride home
from somebody else.

288
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:02,575
- You sure?
- Yeah.

289
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,947
Go.

290
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:19,588
Seriously, guys.
I'm over it. Really.

291
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,259
What?

292
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:25,862
Nothing. Sorry. It's just--

293
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:29,170
Well, he is the most dope guy
in school.

294
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:31,472
Yeah, and school's over.

295
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:40,219
Anyway, I mean,
who does he think he is, Brad Pitt?

296
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,881
Seriously,
and you're, like, Gwyneth.

297
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:45,356
Seriously, you know
he regrets breaking up with her.

298
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,188
You know what?
That's really sweet.

299
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,228
- But I think I'm gonna--
- No, we mean it.

300
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:53,460
- You are so Gwyneth !
- Totally Gwyneth, but prettier!

301
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:56,127
Totally prettier,
but with bigger boobs.

302
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,262
- Totally bigger boobs.
- Way bigger.

303
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:01,239
You know what? I think I'm gonna
go outside and get some fresh air.

304
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:04,277
But he's no Brad.

305
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,278
He is not even Brad
in "Twelve Monkeys"...

306
00:20:06,346 --> 00:20:08,280
when he had that weird eye,
and he was all dirty.

307
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:12,546
Girlfriend, Mike Dexter doesn't even
deserve to breathe the same air as Brad.

308
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:16,146
- No, he doesn't.
- Mike Dexter is an asshole.

309
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:18,851
An asshole!

310
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:25,331
All right. You know what?
I don't really want to talk about this.

311
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,667
Okay, I don't think
she's prettier than Gwyneth.

312
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,229
Not even.

313
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,876
All right. This is it.

314
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:46,317
If is finally time
for Kenny Fisher fo become the man.

315
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:47,819

My fault. Sorry.

325
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,993
Uh, excuse me?

326
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:32,088
Is this the beer?

327

What the hell

328
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:36,468
Yeah. Sorry.

00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:55,780
It's terrible!
Nobody drink the beer!

331
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,450
The beer has gone bad!

332
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,993
- Tastes like beer to me.
- Yeah, me too.

333
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:02,995
Mine's great.

334
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,632
Yo, Ashley.
Damn, you look beautiful.

335
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,137
- Thanks.
- Yo, check this.

336
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,971
I was reminiscin' today. I was thinkin'
about that time in seventh grade.

337
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,806
We was all playin' spin the bottle
at Lynn Eckert's house, remember?

338
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,312
- I guess.
- Yeah.

339
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,076
Well, you and me, we never did
get that kiss, right?

340
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,448
But I had this mad flashback
that you were starin' at me all night.

341
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,453
Kind of giggling with your girlfriends.
You remember that?

342
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:32,013
Oh, I do remember that.
You were eating Chee-tos.

343
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:34,185
- Yeah.
- And that orange stuff was all stuck...

344
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,991
in your braces and nobody
wanted to tell you.

345
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:39,861
So you just kept on eatin' 'em.
Oh, my God!

346
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:42,902
Lynn and I thought
that was the funniest thing.

347
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:45,096
- Lynn, come over here!
- What?

348
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:50,074
Oh, my God. I'm tellin' little Kenny how
we used to call him "Chester Chee-tos."

349
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:52,868
What are you laughin' at?

350
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:54,379
Cheetah.

351
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,319
- Oh, bye, Chester.
- Good-bye, Chester.

352
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:06,348
Yo, use me for my body, baby.

353
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,587
Come on, baby. Yeah.

354
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:10,254
What's up, ladies?

355
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:14,863
Yo, Jana, you wanna dance?

356
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,493
I'm allergic.

357
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,528
Allergic? To dancin'?

358
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,040
Yeah.

359
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,736
- Hey, I want you to have this.
- Oh, thank you.

360
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,238
I heard that Mike broke up with her
a year ago...

361
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,571
and she has been paying him $50 a month
to act like they're still together.

362
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,804
- Uh, pathetic.
- It's so pathetic.

363
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:09,219
Preston Meyers?
Dude, what's goin' on, man?

364
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,419
I'm so glad I got a chance to see you.
I know you're leaving tomorrow.

365
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,792
- I'm gonna miss you, man, you know.
- It's okay, man. Don't worry about it.

366
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,661
I was totally remembering the time
we were in the seventh grade...

367
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:21,792
and we mashed up our food
on our lunch trays...

368
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:24,996
and you paid me a dollar to eat it,
and I did.

369
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:27,335
- It was the best!
- Good time.

370
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,739
Hey, how ya been?

371
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,710
Hey, and what about that time
during softball practice...

372
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:37,239
when Ricky Feldman hit that line drive
and it hit you right in your nuts?

373
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:41,185
That was the funniest, man.
I just don't know what to say about it.

374
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:11,340
You remember the time on the field trip
to the meat packing plant...

375
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:14,444
and you, like, threw up
all in your book bag?

376
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:17,319
- That wasn't me.
- Bull corn! Remember?

377
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,723
Because you tried to leave the bag
on the bus so no one would see it.

378
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:23,763
But then Vice Principal Billard
took it around to all the classes...

379
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,162
to see who it was, and I was, like,
"Wasn't that your bag?"

380
00:25:26,232 --> 00:25:30,134
And you were, like, "No."
And I was, like, "l think it is, dude."

381
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:33,739
- Hi, Ron.
- Hi. Are you okay?

382
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:37,766
- I just heard you and Mike broke up.
- Yeah.

383
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:39,971
Yeah.

384
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:42,071
Well, I just can't believe
you didn't tell me.

385
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:45,982
- I mean, after all, we're family.
- Second cousins.

386
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:48,179
You know, exactly.
We should be able to talk about these--

387
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:50,654
I was like, "Dude, you're never
gonna get that smell out of there."

388
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,657
Hey, I got one for ya.

389
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:55,660
Remember that time when I was about
to talk to that beautiful girl...

390
00:25:55,728 --> 00:25:58,288
and you started telling me
all these asinine stories?

391
00:25:58,364 --> 00:26:00,764
Remember that? Huh?

392
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:04,167
Gee, that's funny
'cause it just happened!

393
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:07,506
Yo, man.
I'm never gonna forget this.

394
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:09,974
Hey, man. See if I contact you
for the reunion.

395
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:14,480
It's all about the memories, man.
All about the memories.

396
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,579
Hey, who wants to go
in the hot tub with us?

397
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:25,421
- Hey, yo, G. What's up?
- Hey, what's up, man?

398
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:27,460
Yo, shouldn't you be gettin'
your freak on by now?

399
00:26:27,527 --> 00:26:30,724
I'm just flossin' while those two 'hos
over there scratch it out...

400
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,425
over who gets to knock the boots
with me, you know what I'm sayin'?

401
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,628
- Yeah.
- What two 'hos, man?

402
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:39,467
I don't see no 'hos, Kenny.

403
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:42,269
- Yo, what, you callin' me a liar?
- Hey, yo, why you shovin', cracker?

404
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:44,776
You better recognize, fool.

405
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,748
Why y'all gotta waste
my flavor? Damn !

406
00:27:03,563 --> 00:27:06,293
Dude, can I talk to you
for a second?

407
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:13,238
Hey, Mike.
What's up, man?

408
00:27:13,306 --> 00:27:15,274
What's goin' on?
Did ya do it?

409
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:22,213
- Come on.
- Mike. Look, man. I don't know, man.

410
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:25,979
You see, Rachel's parents
are away, right?

411
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:30,887
So she was kinda thinkin' that maybe
we can spend the night, you know?

412
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,949
What about the game plan, man?
You promised.

413
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:39,855
See, it's just that Rachel's parents,
they have mirrors.

414
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,092
Above the bed, dude.
I'm gonna be like this. Look.

415
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:50,705
All right. I get the picture.
You know what?

416
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:54,235
I'm gonna go see what the other guys
are doin'. Maybe they got some balls.

417
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:42,457
Um, weren't you in my language lab?

418
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:45,997
Yeah, I was.

419
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:49,296
See, I told you guys
she went to our school. Pay up.

420
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:55,968
Anybody order a love burger,
well done?

421
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:58,306
One, two-- Whoa! What is that?

422
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:01,973
It's one of our shirts, man.
I'm wearin' it for publicity.

423
00:29:02,048 --> 00:29:04,573
Those are for the fans. You don't wear
the shirt of the band you're in.

424
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,915
I think it's cool.
Throw me one.

425
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:09,318
- We don't throw him one.
- Hey, look.

426
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:12,950
If they get to wear the shirts,
maybe I should wear the hat.

427
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:15,051
You guys suck!

428
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,858
- What the hell is that?
- A hat.

429
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,857
Take off the hat.

430
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:23,026
- No.
- Take it off.

431
00:29:28,574 --> 00:29:32,032
Look, you come in here lookin' like the
white artist formerly known as Prince.

432
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:35,547
- Listen, here, Hootie.
- Hootie? You look like LeStat.

433
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,549
Oh, my God!

434
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:40,882
See? That's why I said
no smoking in the house!

435
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:48,323
Oh, wait. Is that poop?

436
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,588
Someone have poop on their shoe?

437
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,258
Oh, my God.

438
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,031
- Someone has poop on their shoe!
- Watch it!

439
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,112
And then I heard...

440
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,877
that he slept with some sophomore.

441
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,886
That pig!
What are you gonna do?

442
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:18,379
Beat him at his own game.

443
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:23,191
I am gonna hook up
with someone at this party...

444
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,662
and hope that Jason finds out.

445
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:28,394
- Wait. With who?
- Who cares?

446
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:31,369
The next guy who hits on me.

447
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:34,133
No. Hell, the next guy
who talks to me.

448
00:30:36,843 --> 00:30:38,071
Wipe out.

449
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:42,906
I, uh-- Yo, I must have died
and gone to heaven...

450
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:45,610
'cause I see an angel sittin'
right in front of me.

451
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:49,414
Are you cryin'?

452
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:53,755
Oh, no, baby, please!
You are far too fine to look so sad.

453
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:59,293
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on. Don't be like that.

454
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:01,799
It breaks my heart
to see you this way.

455
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:09,639
You tell Special K what he can do
to make you feel better.

456
00:31:13,713 --> 00:31:16,079
Come to the pool house with me?

457
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:20,142
Of course I will.

458
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:22,653
Anything for you, baby.

459
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,624
Could you just wait right here.

460
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:29,957
I'll be right back. I promise.

461
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:32,997
He'll do.

462
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:36,000
All right. Bathroom, pee,
underarm check, Breath Assure--

463
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,696
Yo, hold up.
Do I put on a jimmy hat now or--

464
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,762
Nah, that ain't gonna work.

465
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:45,276
Damn!

466
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:50,181
Yo, they're out of toilet paper.

467
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,186
- Wait, Jen! Wait for us!
- Oh, I gotta go!

468
00:31:56,756 --> 00:32:00,385
- Oh, don't you hate that?
- Oh, wait! Don't lock it!

469
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:04,995
- Let's go pee in the pool.
- All right.

470
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:13,428
What the hell is this?

471
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:18,510
Is there another bathroom upstairs?

472
00:32:18,578 --> 00:32:20,512
'Cause the line in there is really long,
and I gotta go.

473
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,573
No one's allowed upstairs, okay?
Who did this?

474
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,584
I think I saw that
foreign exchange student...

475
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:29,212
walkin' around
with a black Magic Marker.

476
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,552
- That little foreign guy?
- Yeah. So, the ba--

477
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,251
You can go upstairs,
but just you.

478
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,921
Thanks. All right.

479
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:41,524
And don't close the door all the way
because it's sort of broken.

480
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,141
Damn! You the man, Kenny!

481
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:13,094
Here we go.

482
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:27,409
Yo, this ain't gonna--

483
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,675
Yeah. I can do--

484
00:33:32,518 --> 00:33:36,978
Damn ! She's gonna think I got
that premature evacuation. Damn !

485
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,960
Damn!

486
00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:56,207
Dudel

487
00:33:57,376 --> 00:33:59,606
These brownies suck!

488
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:10,247
I don't wanna waste this.

489
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,624
I better double bag it.
I don't know where that girl been.

490
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,398
Shut that door!

491
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:29,634
- No, I mean, get out!
- Yeah, I'm trying to!

492
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,904
- Get outl
- I can't!

493
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:33,707
Move, woman !

494
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,892
Look what I got now!
I got the--

495
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,896
Look, I am telling you...

496
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,195
that patch of sky right over there
above those power lines...

497
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:58,964
is like a superhighway
of U.F.O. activity.

498
00:35:01,807 --> 00:35:04,241
I wonder how William's doin'
at the party.

499
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,906
I hope he isn't having
any trouble blendin' in.

500
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:15,346
Wasn't there somethin'
I was supposed to do tonight?

501
00:35:24,063 --> 00:35:27,692
I can't feel my legs.
I have no legs!

502
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:56,253
Can I talk to you
for a second, man?

503
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,104
Well, did you do it or what?

504
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:11,305
Man, we will. I promise.

505
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,574
But her dad got us all tickets
to see Pearl Jam.

506
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:16,740
So we're gonna do it
after the concert.

507
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:19,011
I thought Beth can kiss your ass.
Come on.

508
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:24,648
Mike, sometimes we say things
we don't mean.

509
00:36:25,624 --> 00:36:28,616
- Well, when's the concert?
- August.

510
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:34,189
You guys suck.

511
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:37,599
- But they're really good seats.
- We're gonna deal with it eventually!

512
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:49,776
If you ask me, I never really saw
you two together in the first place.

513
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:52,750
Yeah. You and me both.

514
00:36:53,886 --> 00:36:57,481
- What?
- Well, I know why I started dating him.

515
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:00,548
I just don't know
why I did it for so long.

516
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:07,161
It's just-- God, at first,
it was all so unbelievable.

517
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,258
And, I mean,
at my old junior high school...

518
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:13,203
I was always just this little,
well, nobody.

519
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,763
And then I came to Huntington
freshman year...

520
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:18,469
and Mike Dexter
wanted to date me.

521
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:23,481
And all of the sudden,
I was, like, "Little Miss Popular."

522
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:28,019
I know it sounds lame,
but it felt good.

523
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:32,286
It's the first time I'd ever felt cool
in my whole life.

524
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,816
Please. It was the first time
I'd ever had a boyfriend.

525
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:39,353
I don't understand.
I mean, what happened?

526
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:42,662
Nothing.

527
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:46,831
See, that's the problem because Mike
is the same guy now he was then.

528
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:49,568
You know, mooning the guy
at the drive-through window...

529
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,042
giving the underclassmen wedgies.

530
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:54,909
Yeah. I've heard he does that.

531
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,416
So why didn't you just,
you know, break up with him?

532
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:02,077
'Cause I was, um...

533
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:07,083
scared of being alone.

534
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,390
Mike and I went out
for, like, four years.

535
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:12,862
You know, that's, like, forever.

536
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:16,959
And if I'm not Mike's girlfriend,
you know, who am l?

537
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:19,971
Nobody knows me as anything else.

538
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,107
I don't think I know me
as anything else.

539
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:35,077
Look...

540
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:38,351
I don't know about you...

541
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:41,655
but I really believe...

542
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:44,594
that there's one person
out there...

543
00:38:44,663 --> 00:38:46,426
for everybody.

544
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,601
That's what this is about.

545
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:54,438
It's not just
some sappy love letter telling her...

546
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:57,270
how my heart stops
every time that I see her.

547
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,180
It's in there, but--

548
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:07,942
It's not just to tell her how I think
she's more than the homecoming queen...

549
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,147
or Mike's girlfriend or...

550
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,589
how there's this really
amazing person inside of her...

551
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,093
that no one even bothers to see.

552
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,464
It's in there, too, but...

553
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,998
what it's really about...

554
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:28,704
is how she should just
give me a chance.

555
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:32,009
Just one chance.

556
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:37,714
Maybe we could find out if there's
a reason for all of this--

557
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,019
why she's not with Mike tonight...

558
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:45,352
and after four years,
I'm still here with this letter.

559
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,494
Maybe we could find out
what that reason is.

560
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:54,764
You know...

561
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:58,069
it's time to find out.

562
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,373
I think I'm ready to do this.

563
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,874
Finally.

564
00:40:06,078 --> 00:40:08,012
Any words of encouragement?

565
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,216
Would you like to touch my penis?

566
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:24,659
I am a sex machine.

567
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,160
No one can hear us.

568
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,946
- Are you satisfied?
- Woman, this is all your fault.

569
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:51,751
Bargin' in here
like a freakin' moose, all--

570
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,258
Really? Well, if I'd known
you were gonna be in here...

571
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,693
half-naked, pleasuring yourself
or whatever--

572
00:40:57,763 --> 00:41:00,755
-Don't touch that.
-I definitely would have gone elsewhere.

573
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,530
- I was gettin' my shit ready.
- Your "shit."

574
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,537
Yeah, 'cause for your information...

575
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:09,335
there is a supermad honey
downstairs just waitin'.

576
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:12,036
She is dyin'
to have sex with me.

577
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:15,638
Oh, Jason, I never should
have believed those rumors.

578
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:18,410
- Let's never fight again.
- Oh, never, baby.

579
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:20,509
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Preston. What's up, man?

580
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:22,019
- How are ya?
- All right.

581
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,612
- Have you seen Amanda Beckett?
- Yeah. I just saw her in there.

582
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,557
Hey. Did you hear
Mike Dexter broke up with her?

583
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:30,993
I'm thinkin' about askin' her out.
It's time to get freaky!

584
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,007
Thanks for listening.
God, I got to be prom queen...

585
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:44,508
and now I want people
to feel sorry for me too?

586
00:41:44,576 --> 00:41:47,306
- I should just shut up.
- No. It's okay.

587
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,313
I mean, you know,
you need someone to listen.

588
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,848
Thanks.

589
00:41:57,523 --> 00:42:01,050
Amanda, I feel really
close to you now.

590
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,276
- What are you doing?
- Oh, well, I care about you.

591
00:42:19,344 --> 00:42:20,834
Oh, will you get off?

592
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,939
- Come on. It's okay, baby!
- That is disgusting!

593
00:42:24,016 --> 00:42:26,348
Come on. You were practically
begging me for it.

594
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,352
That is not what I was saying.

595
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,615
And you're my cousin !

596
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:33,783
- Through marriage.
- Whatever! You're sick!

597
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:38,492
Shit. You're not gonna tell
my parents about this, are you?

598
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,147
- You see the salt on this pretzel?
- Yes.

599
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:00,378
Look at the stars.

600
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:03,910
Now some people,
they say the stars are...

601
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:09,359
billions and billions
of tons of hot gas.

602
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:13,956
But I think maybe
it's just God's salt.

603
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:17,565
And God's just waitin' to eat us.

604
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:24,198
Have I got some news for you.

605
00:43:24,276 --> 00:43:26,403
Really? What's that?

606
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,074
That I recently became single.

607
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,583
And?

608
00:43:34,052 --> 00:43:38,250
Well, I just remember Jeff Gurner
sayin' a little somethin' about...

609
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:40,848
you girls thinkin' I was
the hottest senior in school.

610
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:42,484
Yeah.

611
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:47,095
And I remember Jeff Gurner
saying that...

612
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,634
you told him we were "skanky."

613
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:52,369
He told you that?

614
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:55,806
Okay. See you later.

615
00:43:57,442 --> 00:43:59,376
Hey, isn't this the weekend...

616
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:02,675
that you're supposed to meet
your girlfriend from the internet?

617
00:44:02,748 --> 00:44:06,149
Yeah, but she has
some photo shoot in Fiji...

618
00:44:06,218 --> 00:44:08,152
for a catalog or something.

619
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,586
- Oh, man. That sucks.
- Yeah.

620
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:15,288
I guess that's just the price you pay
for dating Christie Turlington.

621
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,934
This song goes ouf to Hope
from her boyfriend Ken.

622
00:44:25,003 --> 00:44:26,937
If's about love.

623
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:32,043
Love hurfs

624
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,943
Love scars

625
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:36,947
Love wounds

626
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:42,913
Maybe somebody threw it out.
You don't throw away a yearbook!

627
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:45,354
You're supposed
to cherish it forever.

628
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:48,621
Oh, thank God. Look at you.

629
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,523
Trisha, sign my yearbook!

630
00:44:56,668 --> 00:44:59,535
- Oh, I stepped in guml
- Come on. We're already late.

631
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:08,245
Yuck!

632
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:18,054
Cuts to the left, decks the crap
out of the wing and boom!

633
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:20,853
Open net! Scores!

634
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,359
Yeah!

635
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,434
Does that feel good?

636
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:43,208
Damn, woman. Why you gotta be
such a ragin' bitch?

637
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,649
Oh, please. Listen to you.
Look. There's a mirror right there.

638
00:45:46,718 --> 00:45:49,346
Why don't you take a look, okay?
You're white!

639
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,420
What's that supposed to mean?

640
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:59,657
- I don't always talk like that.
- Oh, I guess you're okay, then.

641
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:03,667
What about you, huh?
What about you, Miss Antisocial?

642
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:06,602
Miss Walkin' Around, Just, I Think
I'm So Much Better Than Everybody Else.

643
00:46:06,672 --> 00:46:09,903
I do not think
I am better than anybody.

644
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:15,809
Anyway, what do you care
what I think about you, okay?

645
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:18,645
You pretty much haven't spoken to me
since sixth grade.

646
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:21,550
Hey, you stopped speakin' to me.

647
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,747
- Okay. Whatever.
- Damn, you got no--

648
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:29,588
You have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

649
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:32,286
You don't even know me anymore.

650
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:35,898
Yes, I do.
I know exactly who you are.

651
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:39,733
You're Kenny Fisher
who used to play--

652
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:41,773
We used to play "Miami Vice"
in my basement.

653
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,241
You used to sleep over my house. You had
to leave the hall light on every night.

654
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,871
You're Kenny Fisher who used to buy me
a card every Valentine's Day...

655
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:53,247
and a bag of those little hearts
with the words on 'em.

656
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:55,309
Geez.

657
00:46:56,488 --> 00:47:00,618
You're Kenny Fisher who got too cool
to hang out with me in junior high...

658
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,217
'cause I was in
all the smart classes...

659
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:06,321
and 'cause my parents
didn't make a lot of money...

660
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:11,301
and 'cause you desperately needed to sit
at the trendy table in the cafeteria.

661
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,977
Whaf fhe hell happened?

662
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:25,547
She's not supposed fo be wifh somebody
else. She's supposed to be with me.

663
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:28,643
I mean, fhere was even
fhat song on fhe radio.

664
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,847
Wasn 'f fhaf a sign?

665
00:47:31,957 --> 00:47:36,018
Unless Denise was righf.
Maybe fhaf song was aboit a dog.

666
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:39,530
Well, what was I supposed to do then,
go ouf and buy a dog?

667
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:42,294
No. If had to be a sign.

668
00:47:43,835 --> 00:47:46,429
It's not like you hear fhe song
"Mandy' on fhe radio every day.

669
00:47:46,505 --> 00:47:48,632
I haven'f heard fhaf song
in, like, ten years.

670
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:51,039
And since today
is Barry Manilow's birthday...

671
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:55,273
we'll be playing "Mandy" every hour
on fhe hour here at Mellow 103.

672
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:58,180
- Thank you very, very much.
- And as a special treaf for you...

673
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,742
we'll have the Man-ilow himself
fo answer your quesfions...

674
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,983
Iive on fhe phone from
his sold-ouf concerf in Tokyo.

675
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:08,548
So if you've got a question
for fhe man who "wrifes the songs"...

676
00:48:08,627 --> 00:48:11,152
get fo the phone and call in now.

677
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,208
Excuse me.

678
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:42,075
Are you gonna be long?
I just need to make one call.

679
00:49:43,622 --> 00:49:46,420
Oh. There's two other phones.

680
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:48,425
Yeah. They're broken.

681
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:52,293
- I just put my money in.
- It's sort of an emergency.

682
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,424
- Look. It won't take long.
- My car broke down and I need to call--

683
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,832
- Shh! Wait.
- A cab.

684
00:49:57,903 --> 00:50:00,371
- Hello? Yeah, Mellow 103?
- Hello, 103.

685
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:02,406
- You're on the air.
- Finally. Listen...

686
00:50:02,474 --> 00:50:04,408
I have a really important question
for Barry Manilow.

687
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:08,071
- Barry's listening.
- In that song "Mandy"--

688
00:50:08,146 --> 00:50:09,579
Hello?

689
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,347
Why did you do that?

690
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:19,515
Wait a second. Lady, I was--

691
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,294
I was talking to somebody!

692
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:32,459
No! You don't just hang up!

693
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,802
- Rapid Cabs.
- Hi. I need a cab, please.

694
00:50:35,874 --> 00:50:38,001
- I'm at Johnny's on the boulevard.
- Who are you? I was--

695
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,704
- I'm an angel.
- I had so--

696
00:50:45,183 --> 00:50:47,174
Okay, I'm done now.

697
00:50:48,553 --> 00:50:51,852
You don't just hang up
on somebody's call like that.

698
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:56,383
I think my emergency was just
a little bit larger than yours, junior.

699
00:50:58,163 --> 00:50:59,926
How the hell do you know?

700
00:50:59,998 --> 00:51:01,932
You have no idea how long--

701
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,166
This is great.
This is just, just great.

702
00:51:07,238 --> 00:51:10,230
This is officially the worst night
of my entire life. Thank you very much.

703
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,345
Try having 40 drunk men
grabbing your ass...

704
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:17,608
one groom-to-be
throwin' up all over you...

705
00:51:17,682 --> 00:51:19,912
and then have your car break down
at 2:00 a.m....

706
00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:23,682
and then you can talk to me
about havin' a bad night, okay?

707
00:51:26,091 --> 00:51:28,423
- You're a stripper?
- I'm a dancer.

708
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:30,427
An angel stripper.

709
00:51:31,496 --> 00:51:33,657
Oh, I'm the weirdo.

710
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:38,032
You're the one calling Barry Manilow
from a phone booth at 2:00 a.m.

711
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,210
You're right.

712
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,814
I'm a total loser.

713
00:51:57,355 --> 00:51:59,823
No, wait. I'm sorry.

714
00:51:59,891 --> 00:52:02,382
Great.
Like I could feel any worse.

715
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:26,245
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen!

716
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:28,251
What is wrong with you people?

717
00:52:37,462 --> 00:52:40,260
Do you know who Preston Meyers is?

718
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:44,427
Duh. He only sat right next to you
in freshman English.

719
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:46,436
But I guess
you wouldn't remember that.

720
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:50,531
Why would Amanda Beckett pay attention
to a unique spirit like Preston...

721
00:52:50,608 --> 00:52:54,203
or even a unique spirit like me,
for instance?

722
00:52:54,279 --> 00:52:57,578
Maybe it's because
she's just a little too busy...

723
00:52:57,649 --> 00:53:01,676
ordering around her little
conformist flock of sheep.

724
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:03,687
Sheep!

725
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:08,192
You are all sheep.

726
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:28,176
Hey, Luke doesn't push Vader.

727
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,646
Well, he should've.
I mean, the guy cut his hand off.

728
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:34,708
Those were our only flashlights.

729
00:53:34,786 --> 00:53:36,720
Oh, yeah.

730
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,957
Geez.

731
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:43,721
- It's kinda dark up here.
- Yeah.

732
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:48,799
You know what?

733
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,930
This is just like
that Scott Baio thing.

734
00:53:53,004 --> 00:53:56,940
When I was 16, I had
the biggest thing for Scott Baio.

735
00:53:57,008 --> 00:54:01,945
You don't have to sit here
and go through-- Scott Baio?

736
00:54:02,013 --> 00:54:04,504
I said I was 16.

737
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:07,983
I mean, this went back
to the "Happy Days" years...

738
00:54:08,052 --> 00:54:10,680
not to mention
"J oanie Loves Chachi."

739
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:12,655
God, I hated her.

740
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:14,214
Joanie.

741
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,193
See, I always knew
that somehow...

742
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:18,729
I'd meet him.

743
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:22,289
Like if I wanted it bad enough,
I could make it happen.

744
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:24,924
And it did...

745
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:27,870
right after his first season
of "Charles ln Charge."

746
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:32,808
He was doing this mall tour,
and he came here to our mall.

747
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:36,210
It was like everything
was finally falling into place.

748
00:54:36,281 --> 00:54:38,841
- You know, like it was--
- Fate.

749
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:40,407
Yeah!

750
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,420
So I went, you know.

751
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,479
And he had this red bandanna...

752
00:54:45,557 --> 00:54:48,492
'cause, you know, Chachi
always wore that red bandanna.

753
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:51,962
And I waited there outside.

754
00:54:54,432 --> 00:54:58,596
And I was the first person
when he pulled up.

755
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,865
He got out of that car--

756
00:55:03,575 --> 00:55:05,873
He was so beautiful.

757
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:08,435
And he looked right at me.

758
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,447
I didn't know what to do.

759
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,040
I couldn't say anything.
I couldn't move.

760
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:16,677
I never even talked to him,
and he was right there.

761
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,850
I still have that red bandanna.

762
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,290
The thing is, you never know.

763
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,854
Like, had I at least
maybe said something.

764
00:55:27,932 --> 00:55:30,230
You never know.

765
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:33,327
But anyway, the point is,
I totally realized...

766
00:55:33,404 --> 00:55:34,996
you know, fate.

767
00:55:35,073 --> 00:55:37,769
There is fate,
but it only takes you so far...

768
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:41,300
because once you're there,
it's up to you to make it happen.

769
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,572
You are so definitely right.

770
00:55:44,649 --> 00:55:46,981
I know.

771
00:55:47,051 --> 00:55:48,678
So look.

772
00:55:48,753 --> 00:55:51,017
Don't make the same mistake I did.

773
00:55:51,089 --> 00:55:54,149
If you really want to be with him,
get back on that phone...

774
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,786
and call Barry Manilow
and tell him how you feel.

775
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:01,625
I didn't want him.

776
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,927
It's okay.
I don't think it's weird.

777
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:09,337
I mean, come on. Scott Baio.

778
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,341
We all have our things.

779
00:56:16,948 --> 00:56:21,146
And I'm ready to fake

780
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:24,655
A chance again

781
00:56:24,722 --> 00:56:29,352
Ready fo put my love
on the line

782
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,123
With you

783
00:56:32,196 --> 00:56:34,289
You are a no-talent,
posturing little smurf!

784
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:38,699
Really? That's not what your girlfriend
said last night in your van.

785
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:47,771
You guys are such amateurs.
I quit!

786
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,375
Way to go.
Why don't you just take off the T-shirt?

787
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,884
- Me?
- You!

788
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,046
We were fine until you pulled out
that stupid hat.

789
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:58,884
This hat is not stupid!

790
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,857
This hat is cool.

791
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:04,224
- Way to go, man.
- What the hell did I do?

792
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,090
Get outta here!

793
00:57:08,232 --> 00:57:10,166
I'll be the band, dudes.

794
00:57:20,078 --> 00:57:21,909
Hey, I know this song.

795
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,572
I know this song.

796
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,742
The guy I tutored in math
used to make me listen to it.

797
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:37,617
Wild Bill !
Rock and roll!

798
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:40,931
Take me down
to fhe paradise city

799
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,298
Where fhe grass is green
and the girls are preffy

800
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,770
Oh, won'f yoi please take me home

801
00:57:58,116 --> 00:58:00,641
Get offl

802
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:28,138
Far away

803
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:33,377
So far away

804
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:36,282
Caf in the cenfer
has been forn apart

805
00:58:36,354 --> 00:58:38,413
- He is so cute!
- I know.

806
00:58:39,123 --> 00:58:41,557
Tear me a rug
Take me back to fhe start

807
00:58:41,626 --> 00:58:44,925
I'll scream loose in my mind
Are you blind

808
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:10,019
Oh, my God!

809
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,715
Oh, yeah!

810
00:59:18,963 --> 00:59:21,022
Dale! Sign my yearbook!

811
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:30,106
You know what?

812
00:59:30,174 --> 00:59:33,507
My retainer kind of looks
like a Klingon warship.

813
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:36,510
Fire photons.

814
00:59:47,692 --> 00:59:51,253
This is the greatest night
of my lifel

815
01:00:17,555 --> 01:00:20,388
- Get up.
- What?

816
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,824
- I got to pee.
- You are not peeing in here.

817
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:26,227
- It's a bathroom.
- I'm aware of that by now.

818
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:30,333
Are you gonna move?
'Cause I'm gonna go.

819
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:31,834
You are disgusting.

820
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:47,017
I cannot listen to this.

821
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:58,793
So were you saving up
all that stuff to tell me?

822
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,890
You really want to talk about this
while you're doing that?

823
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:07,028
Geez, it could've been on your mind
the last six years.

824
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:09,004
You might've mentioned something.

825
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:13,109
When? When you were ignoring me
in the halls?

826
01:01:13,177 --> 01:01:17,273
When you were writing "Denise Fleming's
a tampon" on my locker freshman year?

827
01:01:17,348 --> 01:01:21,512
I did not write
"Denise Fleming is a tampon."

828
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:24,987
Just like you didn't destroy
my Cabbage Patch Kid in second grade.

829
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,982
Second grade?

830
01:01:29,994 --> 01:01:31,928
Besides, I admitted that
right away.

831
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:36,126
No, you didn't. When I picked her up,
her head fell off, you started to cry.

832
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,168
That kind of tipped me off.

833
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,828
I did not cry.

834
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,369
Much.

835
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:48,801
Fine. I told John Keiserman
to write "Denise Fleming is a tampon."

836
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:50,813
I felt really bad afterwards.

837
01:01:57,455 --> 01:01:59,753
It's all right. I told...

838
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:02,486
Diana Yellin you were
a dendrophiliac.

839
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,452
What is that?

840
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:09,429
It's someone who has sex with trees.

841
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,093
That's not funny.

842
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,867
- Oh, Bill!
- He's with me.

843
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:20,376
He asked me
to hold his laser pointer.

844
01:02:20,444 --> 01:02:22,708
Now, ladies, ladies, please.

845
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:26,511
Both of you can hold
my laser pointer anytime.

846
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:28,211
Come on.

847
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:36,317
Did those two girls just go
in the make-out room with...

848
01:02:36,394 --> 01:02:37,952
William Lichter?

849
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:41,157
- Yeah.
- They're so lucky.

850
01:02:47,171 --> 01:02:49,230
Hey, man. You want a beer?

851
01:02:55,513 --> 01:02:58,107
Trip McNealy.

852
01:02:58,182 --> 01:02:59,706
No way, man.

853
01:03:02,553 --> 01:03:04,578
Geez.

854
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,419
You were a sexual icon.

855
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:10,551
You know, girls at Huntington
still talk about you.

856
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:13,995
Really? Which ones?

857
01:03:14,065 --> 01:03:17,523
You must be rackin' up at college.
College.

858
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:20,161
I wish. I can't even get
digits as a freshman.

859
01:03:20,237 --> 01:03:23,832
Shut up. Come on.
You can tell me.

860
01:03:23,908 --> 01:03:25,341
Seriously, man.

861
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:28,810
I thought college
was gonna be a 24-7 orgy.

862
01:03:30,214 --> 01:03:33,809
That's even why I broke up
with Janeen before I left.

863
01:03:38,923 --> 01:03:40,413
So what happened?

864
01:03:42,326 --> 01:03:44,487
College chicks
are totally different, bro.

865
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,964
They're all serious and shit.

866
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:54,930
They all talk about world issues
and "ecolomological" crap.

867
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:57,098
They all wanna date older guys.

868
01:03:59,977 --> 01:04:03,538
Yeah, but not all of 'em, right?

869
01:04:03,614 --> 01:04:05,844
Way it goes.

870
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:09,283
Hell, I even tried crawling back
to Janeen.

871
01:04:09,353 --> 01:04:12,379
She was all cozy with some senior.

872
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:14,151
He's a premed.

873
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:17,757
They all are.

874
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:21,662
Guys like us,
we are a dime a dozen.

875
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,472
Speaking of which...

876
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:32,873
you still with that Amanda chick?

877
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:35,776
She was a prize piece
if I ever saw one.

878
01:04:35,846 --> 01:04:37,438
Yeah.

879
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:39,312
Me and Amanda, definitely.

880
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:42,017
Yep.

881
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,678
You're lucky, bro.

882
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,019
- Sure am.
- Stay with her.

883
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,353
That's the best advice
I can give you.

884
01:04:52,663 --> 01:04:54,460
Oh, that and...

885
01:04:54,532 --> 01:04:57,023
bring rubber flip-flops
to the shower.

886
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:00,127
I got warts all over my feet.

887
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:03,533
Take it easy, Trip.

888
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,941
All right.

889
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,472
Amanda!

890
01:05:19,857 --> 01:05:21,950
Have you seen Amanda Beckett?

891
01:05:22,026 --> 01:05:23,516
No.

892
01:05:26,564 --> 01:05:28,862
Preston? I don't know.

893
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:33,302
Well, his hair's kinda,
I don't know, brown.

894
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:36,362
No, it's not really brown.
Oh, he's tall.

895
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,171
Yeah. He's kinda tall,
sorta tall.

896
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:44,010
And he's like always wearin',
like, T-shirts.

897
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:51,044
Sometimes.

898
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:54,386
- So he's sort of tall?
- Kind of.

899
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,824
- With hair?
- Yeah.

900
01:05:56,894 --> 01:05:59,192
And he wears T-shirts sometimes?

901
01:05:59,263 --> 01:06:00,958
- Yeah.
- Yes.

902
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:03,090
- That's it?
- Well--

903
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,436
I mean, he's Preston.

904
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,234
He's Preston, you know?

905
01:06:09,306 --> 01:06:10,898
I like that guy.

906
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:15,402
You know who else I like
who never got much play...

907
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:17,413
is Velma from "Scooby Doo."

908
01:06:18,949 --> 01:06:21,110
Right.
She was also a cool--

909
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,449
- She was a hip lady.
- Hip chick.

910
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,955
- Watch it!
- Amandal

911
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,434
Oh, God. Mike, get off.

912
01:06:39,637 --> 01:06:42,105
Can't I hug my girl if I want?

913
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:45,198
I am not your girl,
and you're obviously drunk.

914
01:06:45,276 --> 01:06:47,244
- So--
- Wait.

915
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:51,680
We need to talk.

916
01:06:51,749 --> 01:06:53,979
- About what?
- Us.

917
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,383
There is no us.

918
01:06:56,453 --> 01:06:59,354
No, but there is, see, 'cause...

919
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,688
I've been doing
a lot of thinking...

920
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:05,490
and I think--

921
01:07:09,967 --> 01:07:11,457
I think--

922
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:17,870
I think we should
get back together.

923
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:19,773
Why?

924
01:07:21,045 --> 01:07:23,070
- What?
- Why?

925
01:07:23,147 --> 01:07:25,615
Give me one good reason why--

926
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:28,516
No. You know what?
Screw that.

927
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:31,248
No, Mike. My answer is no.

928
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:38,956
You mean you don't want me
to take you back?

929
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:45,325
'Cause I'm serious about this.
You should really think about this.

930
01:07:45,402 --> 01:07:49,429
Think about what? That you're
a childish, self-centered asshole?

931
01:07:54,912 --> 01:07:57,403
Take me back? Please.

932
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,648
Look. You're drunk,
and we're over.

933
01:08:04,722 --> 01:08:08,089
Why don't you just walk away now
and save yourself the embarrassment?

934
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,022
Oh, yeah?

935
01:08:11,095 --> 01:08:13,620
Yeah, well, you're the one...

936
01:08:13,697 --> 01:08:16,427
Amanda, who's gonna be embarrassed.

937
01:08:17,534 --> 01:08:20,002
Who's gonna want you now?

938
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,869
Somebody.

939
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,041
Somebody?

940
01:08:32,116 --> 01:08:34,050
More like...

941
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:35,642
nobody.

942
01:08:38,822 --> 01:08:42,087
Gosh, Mike,
you really got me there.

943
01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:51,266
Fag!

944
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,743
Shut up!

945
01:09:03,147 --> 01:09:04,910
Yes!

946
01:09:04,982 --> 01:09:07,917
I'll kick everyone's ass
in this room!

947
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:27,370
Now that Mike is
completely out of the picture...

948
01:09:27,438 --> 01:09:30,498
I was thinking maybe you'd like
to come to my van...

949
01:09:30,574 --> 01:09:34,032
and I could turn that frown
upside down.

950
01:09:34,111 --> 01:09:37,547
Amanda, hey,
I just saw what happened, and l--

951
01:09:39,016 --> 01:09:41,541
Oh, God, you're a hottie!

952
01:09:41,618 --> 01:09:43,779
Can I see you naked?

953
01:09:43,854 --> 01:09:46,880
Remember that time you danced
with me at the sock hop?

954
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:49,983
I never told you,
but I had the hugest boner.

955
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:53,052
- Maybe we could work things out.
- Let me get you out of that skirt.

956
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:54,722
You're lookin' good.

957
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,831
Hey, Amanda, do you want
some watermelon?

958
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:07,334
Amanda, I love you !

959
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,447
Listen. I know that must sound
really strange, but--

960
01:10:13,517 --> 01:10:17,681
Excuse me. I've always felt there was
this unspoken connection between us...

961
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,883
ever since the first time I saw you when
you were holding my favorite Pop Tart.

962
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:26,253
And the truth is, I'm leaving tomorrow.
If we could go someplace--

963
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:30,266
Oh, you know what?
That is enough !

964
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:34,703
God, I haven't even been single
for like five minutes...

965
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,797
and already you think...

966
01:10:36,874 --> 01:10:41,004
that I am just gonna strip off
my clothes and do you right here...

967
01:10:41,078 --> 01:10:43,376
because, I don't know,
I don't know...

968
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,314
you imagined that we shared
some intimate moment that you...

969
01:10:46,383 --> 01:10:49,841
have probably been drooling over
for the past four years!

970
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,615
How sick and deluded are you?

971
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:58,194
You know, why don't you just
go off and get yourself...

972
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:00,526
a goddamn life, asshole?

973
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,363
Thanks, man.

974
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:08,370
That was the funniest thing
I've seen all night.

975
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,768
Oh, man.
I hope you guys are okay.

976
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:20,543
Don't stick that probe there, Daddy!

977
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,490
Hey, buddy! Hey.

978
01:11:30,894 --> 01:11:34,386
You have to come outside with me,
man, 'cause we are--

979
01:11:34,464 --> 01:11:36,591
There is--

980
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:40,000
There's this chick out there--
There's two chicks out there--

981
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:42,004
They're triplets, man. Huh?

982
01:11:42,072 --> 01:11:45,007
You're not gonna believe what they're
doin', not 'cause I made it up...

983
01:11:45,075 --> 01:11:46,736
but because it is so...

984
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:48,744
unbelievable, man.

985
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:51,406
Come on out to the pool house with me
'cause they told me...

986
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:54,450
that they want you to watch 'em.

987
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:57,351
They want you to watch 'em.
So we're goin' out.

988
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:59,355
Come on. To the pool house.

989
01:12:01,124 --> 01:12:02,853
Come on.

990
01:12:02,926 --> 01:12:04,518
I'm a loser.

991
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:09,666
I broke up with the hottest girl
in school.

992
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:14,132
My friends all sold me out.

993
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:17,139
Someone in there called me a fag.

994
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:19,775
Why?

995
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:23,410
I'll make love to you

996
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,971
Like you want me to

997
01:12:26,049 --> 01:12:28,449
And I'll hold you fight

998
01:12:36,193 --> 01:12:37,785
The right stuff

999
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:40,996
You loved the New Kids.

1000
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:42,656
The acid-washed jeans.

1001
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:46,225
With the built-in rips.
You were a fashion victim from the womb.

1002
01:12:46,303 --> 01:12:48,669
Thank you.
I've gotten better since then.

1003
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:53,400
Yeah, if you need to fit
a family of five in your pants.

1004
01:12:53,477 --> 01:12:55,411
Shut up. These are cool.

1005
01:12:57,014 --> 01:12:59,744
All right.
But the goggles.

1006
01:12:59,816 --> 01:13:01,750
Everybody's wearing these.

1007
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:05,949
All right.

1008
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:07,957
Okay, my turn.

1009
01:13:08,025 --> 01:13:09,617
- What?
- The shoes.

1010
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:12,924
What is wrong with my shoes?
What? What?

1011
01:13:12,996 --> 01:13:15,089
Do they serve
an orthopedic function?

1012
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:19,668
No. Fine.
What about your shoes?

1013
01:13:19,736 --> 01:13:23,672
- What's wrong with my shoes?
- Is there a mission to the moon later?

1014
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,042
Yeah.

1015
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,203
- Your feet smell.
- They do not.

1016
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,884
I'm the king of beer!

1017
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:11,045
You still didn't sign
my yearbook.

1018
01:14:17,894 --> 01:14:21,330
Actually, I'm trying to get everybody
to sign by their own picture.

1019
01:14:21,398 --> 01:14:22,865
Oh, my God.

1020
01:14:22,933 --> 01:14:25,026
Oh, shit.

1021
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,834
What is wrong with everybody?

1022
01:14:27,904 --> 01:14:30,600
These are memories
frozen in time, people!

1023
01:14:33,477 --> 01:14:35,069
A love-struck Romeo

1024
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:39,043
Sings a sfreetsuss serenade

1025
01:14:39,116 --> 01:14:40,674
Layin' everybody low

1026
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:44,547
With a love song fhaf he made

1027
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:46,816
Finds a sfreetlight

1028
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:49,518
Steps ouf of the shade
says something like

1029
01:14:50,794 --> 01:14:53,763
You and me, babe
How about if

1030
01:14:55,665 --> 01:14:58,361
Juliet says
Hey, if's Romeo

1031
01:14:58,435 --> 01:15:01,302
You nearly gave me a heart aftack

1032
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,134
He's underneath the window

1033
01:15:03,206 --> 01:15:05,731
She's singing
Hey, my boyfriend's back

1034
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:11,076
Shouldn't come around here
singing up af people like fhat

1035
01:15:11,148 --> 01:15:12,809
Who needs her?

1036
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:16,751
You know what they say
about women and trolley cars, right?

1037
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,187
There's plenty of 'em in the sea.
Am I right?

1038
01:15:20,257 --> 01:15:22,657
You are correct.

1039
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:26,856
You're 110 percent right.

1040
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,564
- Let me ask you something. Wait.
- What?

1041
01:15:33,937 --> 01:15:35,734
You remember the time...

1042
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:39,469
that you had to make
that really stupid speech...

1043
01:15:39,543 --> 01:15:41,477
and I kinda sorta tripped you...

1044
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:45,242
and everybody started laughing
at you in school?

1045
01:15:45,315 --> 01:15:46,907
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

1046
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:54,816
I'm sorry.

1047
01:15:54,891 --> 01:15:57,587
Oh, man.
Hey, don't worry about it, man.

1048
01:15:57,661 --> 01:16:00,858
Hey, it's ancient history, right?

1049
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,762
It's ancient history.

1050
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:08,536
- When was that anyway?
- That was this morning at graduation.

1051
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:09,970
Oh, yeah.

1052
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:15,506
You think I could get a shirt?

1053
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:17,513
You know, for nostalgia?

1054
01:16:19,249 --> 01:16:20,876
Yeah.

1055
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,351
What would you think
about a reunion?

1056
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:25,047
Nothing big.

1057
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:28,956
A few new songs.
Mostly old stuff.

1058
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,394
I could be into that.

1059
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,795
Sure. Why not?

1060
01:16:35,866 --> 01:16:39,063
When we were in love
you used fo cry

1061
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,071
Said I love you
like the sfars above

1062
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,404
- I love you, man !
- I love you too.

1063
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:48,072
How's my boys?

1064
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,238
Yo, what's up with my niggas, man?

1065
01:16:58,221 --> 01:17:00,587
- Cold floor! Cold floor.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1066
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:02,386
It's okay.

1067
01:17:06,029 --> 01:17:08,156
Have you ever done this before?

1068
01:17:09,599 --> 01:17:11,191
Yeah. Yeah.

1069
01:17:13,136 --> 01:17:15,696
No. Why, have you?

1070
01:17:15,772 --> 01:17:17,831
Yeah, once.

1071
01:17:17,908 --> 01:17:19,842
It was this guy--

1072
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,844
I don't want to know.

1073
01:17:21,912 --> 01:17:24,210
You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1074
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:40,520
- Are they gone? Are they still here?
- I think they're gone, man.

1075
01:17:40,597 --> 01:17:44,089
If they were still here,
I'd break 'em like Kato!

1076
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,236
Cops! Let's bail!

1077
01:17:47,304 --> 01:17:49,238
This is it.
I knew we could do it.

1078
01:17:49,306 --> 01:17:50,739
One, two, three!

1079
01:17:50,807 --> 01:17:52,240
Everybody freeze!

1080
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,550
The cops!

1081
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:06,588
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1082
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:16,559
Bill, you never signed
my yearbook.

1083
01:18:20,303 --> 01:18:24,205
- We can hide in the pool house.
- What the--

1084
01:18:24,274 --> 01:18:26,970
Hey, viva la pool house, right?

1085
01:18:27,043 --> 01:18:30,979
- Come on !
- Pool house. Pool house. Mike!

1086
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,285
My pants!

1087
01:18:41,324 --> 01:18:42,985
Back here, Billy.

1088
01:18:46,062 --> 01:18:47,689
Mike, wait.

1089
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:57,496
It worked. All right,
take off their clothes.

1090
01:19:12,088 --> 01:19:14,215
Get the Polaroid.

1091
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:18,888
Look at you, mister.
I'm a big football jock.

1092
01:19:19,863 --> 01:19:22,331
How do you like me now, buddy?

1093
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:27,735
Look. My flashlight.

1094
01:19:28,838 --> 01:19:31,136
Oh, no. It's William.

1095
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,949
Oh, God. Let's get outta here.

1096
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:14,974
Jesus cribs!

1097
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:19,349
Let's load these sickos
into the wagon.

1098
01:20:38,808 --> 01:20:40,503
Well.

1099
01:20:51,988 --> 01:20:53,421
So--

1100
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:57,050
You know--

1101
01:20:58,962 --> 01:21:00,395
It gets better.

1102
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:03,264
- What?
- Well...

1103
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:06,162
next time, you know...

1104
01:21:07,804 --> 01:21:10,295
you won't be--
It can go for longer.

1105
01:21:11,374 --> 01:21:13,706
No, that's not what I meant.

1106
01:21:13,777 --> 01:21:16,746
I meant that since
we'd never done it before...

1107
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:20,813
together, that--

1108
01:21:20,884 --> 01:21:23,375
How do you know
it wasn't your fault?

1109
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:28,256
You said yourself
you'd only done it one time before.

1110
01:21:28,324 --> 01:21:30,656
Does that made you
some kind of expert?

1111
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:34,890
I never said I was an expert.

1112
01:21:34,964 --> 01:21:38,764
'Cause my shit could've been
slammin' with somebody else.

1113
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:39,893
What?

1114
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:44,162
Look, baby.

1115
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,232
It ain't your fault
you lack the flavor.

1116
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,574
You asshole.

1117
01:21:54,818 --> 01:21:58,049
- Who the hell is in here?
- Don't you even knock?

1118
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:00,112
This is my house!

1119
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,454
Yeah? You should fix that door!

1120
01:22:04,594 --> 01:22:07,791
- Don't touch me. You make me sick.
- Get out!

1121
01:22:07,864 --> 01:22:09,491
- Denise!
- Get out!

1122
01:22:09,566 --> 01:22:12,501
- I'm trying to!
- Well, let me help you!

1123
01:22:12,569 --> 01:22:14,594
Now, get out!

1124
01:22:14,671 --> 01:22:16,161
What is your problem?

1125
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,606
My problem?
You want to know what my problem is?

1126
01:22:19,676 --> 01:22:21,940
I'll tell you what my problem is!

1127
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:29,647
Are you just gonna walk home?

1128
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:31,516
It's not that far.

1129
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:37,425
Just--

1130
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:40,419
Just stop, okay?

1131
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:43,091
Look, just slow down a sec,
would you?

1132
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:45,396
I want to explain.

1133
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:47,936
- Don't bother.
- No, no, no. Come on.

1134
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:03,074
Look, I'm--

1135
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,221
I'm sorry.

1136
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:19,029
You know--

1137
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:22,432
Yeah.

1138
01:23:23,773 --> 01:23:25,741
I shouldn't have said--
You know.

1139
01:23:28,711 --> 01:23:30,303
I'm sorry too.

1140
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:43,691
So.

1141
01:23:56,773 --> 01:23:56,806
Lichter!

1142
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:58,239
Lichter!

1143
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,172
- William!
- What?

1144
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:03,371
Let's go!
Time to get up!

1145
01:24:03,446 --> 01:24:06,244
Your parents are here
to take you home.

1146
01:24:06,316 --> 01:24:08,011
Oh, God!

1147
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:13,615
My parents! Have you seen them?
Are they really angry?

1148
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:17,285
Have you seen my father?
Does he have a weapon?

1149
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,191
Afraid not.

1150
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:23,961
Actually, they're more worried
about you than anything else.

1151
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:27,264
You know, 'cause it's
not your fault that...

1152
01:24:28,504 --> 01:24:33,305
"Mike Dexter beat you up and forced you
to drink alcohol until you passed out."

1153
01:24:33,376 --> 01:24:35,901
He wh-- what?

1154
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:38,914
That's the statement
we got from the Dexter kid.

1155
01:24:38,982 --> 01:24:41,917
He made you drink,
took your clothes off--

1156
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:46,680
Yeah, you know.

1157
01:24:46,756 --> 01:24:49,884
It's just funny
that he finally...

1158
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:51,620
came clean, you know.

1159
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:54,788
Mike, always pickin' on me, yeah.

1160
01:24:57,367 --> 01:24:59,267
Oh, God.

1161
01:25:01,604 --> 01:25:04,334
Well, whatever.

1162
01:25:05,575 --> 01:25:08,510
It might be a good idea
to lay off that alcohol.

1163
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:12,571
Your life's gonna go down the crapper,
unless that's what you're goin' for.

1164
01:25:16,552 --> 01:25:18,076
- Thank you.
- You bet.

1165
01:25:18,154 --> 01:25:19,917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1166
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:22,890
- That a boy.
- Thank you.

1167
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:24,551
Easy now. All right.

1168
01:25:25,862 --> 01:25:27,454
Thank you.

1169
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:30,327
To your right.

1170
01:25:41,778 --> 01:25:44,178
Did you like

1171
01:25:44,247 --> 01:25:46,715
The flowers I sent

1172
01:25:46,783 --> 01:25:49,217
You could've called fo thank me

1173
01:25:49,285 --> 01:25:51,776
Well, you could've called

1174
01:25:51,854 --> 01:25:54,414
And I tried to kiss you

1175
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:57,254
On Brooklyn Avenue

1176
01:25:57,326 --> 01:26:00,056
Buf you got in your car

1177
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:02,393
Before I could move

1178
01:26:02,465 --> 01:26:05,366
And I've been

1179
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:08,598
Falling like fhe rain

1180
01:26:13,309 --> 01:26:17,211
You've got your imbrella

1181
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,077
In my way

1182
01:26:23,653 --> 01:26:26,144
Fists and fingers

1183
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:28,713
Tongues and feeth

1184
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:31,157
I wanna see you

1185
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:33,388
Get out.

1186
01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:35,158
Are you kidding me?

1187
01:26:38,034 --> 01:26:39,797
Kenny Fisher?

1188
01:26:51,514 --> 01:26:53,675
- You guys are a couple now?
- No.

1189
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,344
No. I don't know.

1190
01:26:58,054 --> 01:26:59,988
Can I come to your wedding?

1191
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:04,253
I really should've taken this one
to the grave.

1192
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:08,889
Off of me, please. On to you.
Did you finally? Amanda?

1193
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,863
You did? And?

1194
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:24,345
It's okay. I'm okay.

1195
01:27:26,349 --> 01:27:27,782
You know, l--

1196
01:27:30,086 --> 01:27:33,487
We weren't meant to be,
which sucks, but...

1197
01:27:33,556 --> 01:27:35,751
I know it's over, it's done.

1198
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:41,054
I don't know.

1199
01:27:42,165 --> 01:27:45,134
Maybe there isn't
such a thing as fate.

1200
01:27:47,036 --> 01:27:48,970
And maybe it's all bullshit.

1201
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,399
I feel like--

1202
01:27:54,377 --> 01:27:56,470
maybe it was a hero's trial.

1203
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:02,342
Something to make me
come out a better person.

1204
01:28:06,255 --> 01:28:08,689
I'm trying to make the best of it.

1205
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:12,893
God.

1206
01:28:12,962 --> 01:28:16,056
It would've been cool
to make out with her, though.

1207
01:28:18,534 --> 01:28:20,365
Would you make out with me?

1208
01:28:26,075 --> 01:28:28,543
- Call me when you get there.
- Definitely.

1209
01:28:31,614 --> 01:28:33,104
Take care.

1210
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:36,144
Gimme a hug.

1211
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:43,925
Take care of yourself, okay?

1212
01:28:48,197 --> 01:28:50,131
Just so you know.

1213
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:55,432
Just judging from
my little experience last night...

1214
01:28:55,504 --> 01:28:58,598
I do think there's
such a thing as fate.

1215
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,642
It just works
in really fucked-up ways sometimes.

1216
01:29:04,747 --> 01:29:06,271
Especially in your case.

1217
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:11,686
I'm sorry. You gave that to me.
I had to take it.

1218
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:13,381
Peace out, G.

1219
01:29:20,162 --> 01:29:22,096
Nobody understands
the value of a yearbook.

1220
01:29:22,164 --> 01:29:26,294
- Memories are all we have.
- That's what I've been saying.

1221
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:28,837
All I know is, tonight...

1222
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:31,999
I'm gonna be at some bar
with chicks all over me.

1223
01:29:32,074 --> 01:29:33,666
And you guys...

1224
01:29:34,777 --> 01:29:38,679
are gonna be at home
with your lame-ass girlfriends.

1225
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,943
- Maybe we should break up with them.
- That's what I'm sayin'.

1226
01:29:48,691 --> 01:29:52,388
I never got a chance to thank you
for covering for me last night.

1227
01:29:52,461 --> 01:29:55,225
Thanks for telling the cops
all that stuff.

1228
01:29:55,298 --> 01:29:58,665
I don't think I'm gonna be drinking
like that for a while.

1229
01:29:58,734 --> 01:30:01,328
- That stuff you said--
- Yo! Yo!

1230
01:30:01,404 --> 01:30:04,373
Who said you could sit
with us, geek?

1231
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,238
Shouldn't you be home
playing with your computer?

1232
01:30:07,310 --> 01:30:10,871
Yeah, why don't you go home,
watch "Star Trek," Urkel?

1233
01:30:13,082 --> 01:30:15,016
Urkel.

1234
01:30:52,788 --> 01:30:54,278
That's genius!

1235
01:30:54,357 --> 01:30:56,552
When will I see you again

1236
01:30:58,627 --> 01:31:00,561
Yo, you want some of this?

1237
01:31:16,212 --> 01:31:18,339
Precious moments

1238
01:31:18,414 --> 01:31:21,008
Are we in love

1239
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:24,541
Or jusf friends

1240
01:31:29,892 --> 01:31:32,528
Or is this the end

1241
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:52,703
The Boston Bullet

1242
01:31:52,782 --> 01:31:55,478

1244
01:31:59,388 --> 01:32:01,356
Excuse me.

1245
01:32:01,424 --> 01:32:04,291
I think you dropped this.

1246
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:08,359
What are you doing here?

1247
01:32:08,431 --> 01:32:13,698
Well, your dad told me that you'd
be here, so I thought that I would--

1248
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:20,008
- That's my letter.
- Thought it was my letter.

1249
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:24,736
Yeah, of course it's your letter.
I just--

1250
01:32:27,249 --> 01:32:29,877
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.

1251
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,087
Let me just say that I don't know
what I put in that letter.

1252
01:32:35,157 --> 01:32:38,422
- I wrote it so many times that it--
- Thank you.

1253
01:32:39,662 --> 01:32:41,425
Thank you.

1254
01:32:42,998 --> 01:32:46,729
I mean, you're welcome.

1255
01:32:47,803 --> 01:32:49,236
So...

1256
01:32:50,539 --> 01:32:52,803
you're leaving now?

1257
01:32:55,211 --> 01:32:56,872
God.

1258
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,342
Yeah.

1259
01:32:59,415 --> 01:33:02,509
- It's just--
- Really bad timing?

1260
01:33:06,589 --> 01:33:08,022
Yeah.

1261
01:33:13,462 --> 01:33:18,866
I've got this workshop
with Kurt Vonnegut, and--

1262
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:21,596
- He's my hero and--
- Wow!

1263
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:25,538
That's great.
That's really great. Congratulations.

1264
01:33:27,476 --> 01:33:29,034
Thanks.

1265
01:33:30,212 --> 01:33:34,080
Well, you should--
You should probably go, then.

1266
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:37,911
Maybe it's better this way.

1267
01:33:39,188 --> 01:33:42,749
Maybe I should just be single
for a while or something.

1268
01:33:49,398 --> 01:33:50,831
Sure.

1269
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,925
Maybe it's like you said.

1270
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:55,937
You know, all this happened
for a reason.

1271
01:33:57,239 --> 01:33:59,207
I said that, didn't l?

1272
01:34:02,044 --> 01:34:04,205
Well...

1273
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,941
Preston, good luck.

1274
01:34:07,249 --> 01:34:08,682
Yeah, you too.

1275
01:34:13,656 --> 01:34:15,089
I'll see ya.

1276
01:34:21,764 --> 01:34:25,256
All I needed was fhe love you gave

1277
01:34:26,335 --> 01:34:29,566
All I needed for another day

1278
01:34:29,638 --> 01:34:32,971
And all I ever knew

1279
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,476
Only you

1280
01:34:39,315 --> 01:34:42,079
This is gonna take a long time

1281
01:34:42,151 --> 01:34:45,450
And I wonder what's mine

1282
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:47,716
Can't fake no more

1283
01:34:49,091 --> 01:34:50,683
You know...

1284
01:34:50,759 --> 01:34:54,354
there's probably a later train
I could take.

1285
01:36:08,203 --> 01:36:10,137
I can't believe we jumped William.

1286
01:36:10,205 --> 01:36:13,470
Yeah. I can't believe
we didn't go in to the party.

1287
01:36:13,542 --> 01:36:15,703
- It probably sucked anyway.
- Probably.

1288
01:36:16,879 --> 01:36:18,710
Those people are totally boring.

1289
01:36:18,781 --> 01:36:22,046
Yeah. This town is so lame.

1290
01:36:23,185 --> 01:36:25,119
Tell me about it.

1291
01:36:25,187 --> 01:36:27,212
Nothing exciting ever happens here.
