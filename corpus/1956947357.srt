Dr. Lillian Brooks.

(applause on TV)

200
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,561
Clinically,
this man is brain-dead.

201
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,648
But the brain is stronger
than you think.

202
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,402
What you’re seeing is

203
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,654
the primitive visualization
of a memory.

204
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,741
Ten years ago, my team
developed this technology

205
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,910
for people just like him.

206
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,161

207
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,705
People everyone gave up on.

208
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:49,042
The question now is:
Can we wake them up?

209
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,462
And that question
has led to the development

210
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,589
of our most recent device.

211
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,342

-Oh. Okay.

Thank you.

Nolan Wright, 33 years old.

221
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,118
Involved in a car accident
six months ago

222
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,120
resulting in
the death of his wife

223
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,038
and extensive injury
to his cranium

224
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,124
and medial temporal lobe.

225
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,419
He was found unresponsive
at the scene

226
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,506
and remained in a comatose
state for three days.

227
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,968
On the third day,
he regained consciousness

228
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,262
with severe memory loss.

229
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,976
I’m sorry about your wife.

230
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,813
I know how devastating it is
to lose someone you love.

231
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,400
But I am glad that you finally
decided to come in.

232
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:58,236
I know it’s frustrating
seeing so many doctors.

233
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,990
Right. And-and do you think
this will help with my amnesia?

234
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:06,161
Well, your head seems to have
healed nicely.

235

00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,676
First, I put you under hypnosis
to open up your subconscious.

361
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,470
And this EEG will read
your brain waves

362
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,723
and send them to a processor
inside here.

363
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,350
This processor will extract

364
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,394
those key memories
from your brain waves

365
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,231
and convert each memory into
an immersive virtual experience.

366
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,899
Okay, like-like a hologram?

367
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,987
More like a dream,
like walking in your own shoes.

368
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,947
It’ll feel real.

369
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,159
The goal...

370
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:28,746
is to put you into as many of
those key memories as possible

371
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,123

Well, depends on how
you respond to the therapy.

you back if you leave, okay?

deeper into your subconscious.

444

Beyond this point, we will not
be able to communicate anymore.

When you push the crown
of the watch,

446

Forward for the next,
backward for the previous one.

If at any time
you feel uncomfortable,
