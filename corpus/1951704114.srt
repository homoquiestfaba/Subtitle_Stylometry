1
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:26,358
And...

2
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,021
set.

3
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,461
What is this?
- We're just trying to get...

4
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,124
we're trying to get
to the bottom of it.

5
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:35,066
Bottom of what? What are you,
a fucking, uh, private investigator?

6
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,467
Give me a break. You...
- It's an interview.

7
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,667
What?
- It's an interview.

8
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,572
All right, then let my...
l'll tell you stories about...

9
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,406
I have a lot of funny stories
about Hector

10
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,309
that I could tell you.
And l'll tell you about our lives.

11
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,779
I mean, I want everybody
to know everything.

12
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,975
I want the public
to know, but...

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,076
The public...
...don't fucking get insulting, you know?

14
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,019
You don't tell me how
I should have lived my life.

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,455
L'll tell you
what happened.

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,752
Well, it's your
versión of it.

17
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,760
Yes, it is
my versión of it.

18
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,591
You... if you wanted
somebody else's versión of it,

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:05,689
you should have had
somebody else come.

20
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,598
# Hey hey hey hey #

21
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,538
# Hey hey
hey hey #

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,564
# Hey hey hey hey #

23
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,940
# Hey hey hey hey #
- Yeah!

24
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,911
# Hey hey hey hey... #
- Whoo!

25
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,907
Puchi, they can't find Hector.

26
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,282
They keep calling.

27
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,685
Tell 'em l'm not in!

28
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,485
L... I told them that
already.

29
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,923
Tell 'em
l'm walking the dog.

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,517
Tell 'em... I don't
give a shit.

31
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,153
Tell 'em the same old
fucking story.

32
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,340
Eddie, let's go.

33
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,608
Tito.
- What?

34
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,774
I don't wanna have
to go out looking for you too

35
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,784
when we get home,
okay?

36
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,485
Don't come over here.

37
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,188
Hi, babe.

38
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,217
Come here.

39
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,660
Help me, baby,
please.

40
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,667
But he's driving so slow.
What's the problem?

41
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,259
Who's this fucking driver, Eddie?
Where did you find him?

42
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,134
Hey, hurry up.

43
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,662
Come on.

44
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,245
Don't...

45
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,342
Where are we going?
- Where do you think we're going?

46
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,250
Where are we always going
when we're doing this crazy shit to you

47
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,448
every single time?
Can you please hurry up?

48
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,324
It's your birthday?
- No, it's not my birthday.

49
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,385
Look she's...

50
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,357
Hey, you want your sandwich?

51
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,367
I love you.

52
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,369
You always love me
when you're high.

53
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,371
And l'm always high.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,076
I don't wanna look, man.
L'm looking the other way.

55
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,171
You need to wake up
a little bit. Here.

56
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,739
Here.

57
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,115
Oh!
- Oh!

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,111
Mmm!
- This...

59
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,556
Careful,
what's all this down here?

60
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,492
Ooh hoo hoo!

61
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,696
I love this life.

62
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,757
Hector, Hector...

63
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,134
Let's go.

64
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,604
Move back, move back.
- Come on, get out of the way. We're late.

65
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,129
Get out of the way.

66
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,539
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, let's go.

67
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,304
Ralphie, relax.
We're here, all right?

68
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,312
This is your problem.
You should have gotten here on time.

69
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,678
Come on.
Let's go, come on.

70
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,182
Leave him alone!
What are you doing?

71
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,547
Today he got here early.

72
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,643
Ladies and gentlemen,
the singer

73
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,654
of all singers,

74
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,656
Hector Lavoe!

75
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,390
THE SINGER

76
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,396
# I... #

77
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,495
# Am the singer #

78
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,606
# You've come
to listen to #

79
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,510
# The best #

80
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,846
# Of my songs #

81
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,843
# l'll sing them
all to you #

82
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,550
# l'll sing to a life #

83
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,219
# Of laughter and sorrows #

84
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,024
# I sing to the bad times #

85
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,588
# Sing to the good times #

86
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,260
# You came to have a good time #

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,827
# And paid at the door #

88
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,237
# There's no time
for sadness #

89
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:10,674
# Come on singer, begin. #

90
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,796
My people!

91
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,391
Madison Square Garden...

92
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,591
he filled that place up like that.

93
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,690
You understand?

94
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,794
Hector was the biggest.
And not only New York...

95
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:13,101
all over the worid,
people loved Hector.

96
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,108
1985...
that was the best year.

97
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,317
It was the end
of the good times.

98
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,791
After that, it just...

99
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,168
You want me
to sit over here?

100
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,275
Oh yeah, but I love salsa.

101
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,279
I love to dance.

102
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,749
Should I take off my coat?
- Sure. Go ahead.

103
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,809
It... oh my God, it brings back
so many memories.

104
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,343
We had so many
good times in here,

105
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,878
forget it.

106
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,448
Hector was such a joker.
He was so funny.

107
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,153
That's what I want
everybody to know.

108
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,162
I want 'em to know
how funny he was,

109
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,562
how much we laughed,
how much fun we had.

110
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,598
That's the thing
with Hector:

111
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,535
He didn't know how much
people loved him.

112
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,731
And sometimes, you know,
it would seem like

113
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,536
he didn't want
to know.

114
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,634
It was weird.

115
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,804
But he had it all.
At that time, he had all...

116
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,178
he had everything.
And he had me.

117
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,184
Yeah, for more than
20 years.

118
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,210
Ask these walls.

119
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,653
Yeah, we all seen
better days.

120
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,189
# You walk soundlessly #

121
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,599
# Full of the colors of Avon #

122
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,433
# And whatever cowboy's arm #

123
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,803
# Around your waist #

124
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,040
# I have not seen you in so long #

125
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,879
# Darling, when you die #

126
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,441
# I will still keep the two #

127
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,547
# Wwhite azucenas #

128
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,751
# Which you gave me #

129
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:19,721
# When I sent you away. #

130
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,585
Avuelda, get me a drink, please.

131
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,279
Hey hey hey,
give me a hand with this.

132
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,550
Eh?
- You wanna get in? Give me a hand with this.

133
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,784
Grab that
and follow me.

134
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,158
#... You don't know #

135
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,425
# I am Boricua... #
- # With my machete in my hand #

136
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,066
I thought you were
with the band.

137
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,002
Yeah, I thought you
were with the band.

138
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,038
We're in, man, we're in.
That's all.

139
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,514
What's your name?
- Eddie.

140
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,177
Hector.
- Hector.

141
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,480
A pleasure, man,
a pleasure.

142
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,139
# If I could one day #

143
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,906
# I would climb up to the stars #

144
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,007
# I would take you with me #

145
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,645
# To where
nobody could see us #

146
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,624
# Pay no attention
to the people #

147
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,217
# Just stay the course #

148
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,491
# And love me even more #

149
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,761
# If this is a scandal #

150
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,568
# lt's more shameful
to not know how to love. #

151
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,347
You know how some people...
they struggle for years?

152
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,050
Not him.

153
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,217
It was like
he was prepared for it,

154
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,886
you know,

155
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,259
like he always knew
he was gonna make it.

156
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,299
I mean, he was musical
even when he was insulting someone.

157
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,930
But like I say, he...

158
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,532
it's like he always knew
it was gonna happen for him,

159
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,906
you know what I mean?

160
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,106
It all just came to him.

161
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,945
That was one of his problems,
one of his other problems:

162
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,780
Everything just
came to him.

163
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,412
Excuse me.
Having a good time?

164
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,058
What, are you guys lost
or something?

165
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,651
You lost?

166
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,720
Not at all.? Como esta?
Johnny Pacheco.

167
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,630
Fa... Fania, man.
Fania Records, guy.

168
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,100
L've been hearing a lot about you.
We've checked you out.

169
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,569
You're good, man, really good.
- Thanks a lot, man.

170
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,970
I know you too.
Willie Colon, man.

171
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,408
A pleasure, really.
Trombones, no saxophones.

172
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,379
I mean... you changed
everything. I mean...

173
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,540
Hell.
A pleasure, man. I mean...

174
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,608
Thanks.
I don't speak Spanish.

175
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,984
I like you too, man.

176
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,247
Do you guys
believe in destiny?

177
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,953
Well, I do.

178
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,190
I believe destiny brought us
to this club tonight.

179
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,198
I believe
that you two guys

180
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,668
have been destined
to perform together.

181
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,670
I believe that together,

182
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,298
boys, you will take
this town by storm.

183
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,042
You both have
what each other needs.

184
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,977
You are Puerto Rico.

185
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,446
Willie's from New York.

186
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:32,576
Call this...'salsa'...

187
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,280
a sauce, like gumbo...

188
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,551
...a mix
of mambo, rumba,

189
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,615
plena, jazz,

190
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,024
merengue.

191
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,052
You'll cook it up.

192
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,094
I say...

193
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,624
why not, man?
Damn.

194
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,443
Right here, right here.
- Bro.

195
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,208
Bro, you speak English?
- Of course, of course, man.

196
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,772
$2.50... you'll take me to the Bronx?
- Yeah yeah.

197
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,408
Hey...
- Huh?

198
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,941
You're...

199
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,955
Buddy, tell you what:
You sing, l'll drive.

200
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,084
Sing, bro,
the meter's running.

201
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,093
Listen, I want people
to know something:

202
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,324
God couldn't have given me
a better baby sister

203
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,161
and couldn't have
given her...

204
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,360
...a better brother.

205
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,804
Happy birthday,
my little Puchi.

206
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,867
Happy birthday,
Puchi!

207
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,642
# Cornbread, hog maw
and chitterlings #

208
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:42,017
# Cornbread, hog maw... #
- Oh cuchi cuchi cuchi cuchi.

209
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,717
# Cornbread, hog maw
and chitterlings #

210
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,854
# Cornbread, hog maw... #
- Mommy eating cuchifrito...

211
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,456
# Cornbread, hog maw
and chitterlings#

212
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,525
# Cornbread... #
- Piglet piglet.

213
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,001
# Cornbread, hog maw
and chitterlings#

214
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,871
# Cornbread... #

215
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,516
Are you in the right
apartment?

216
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,917
I think so.

217
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,252
Happy birthday.

218
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,154
For me?

219
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,852
Yeah.
- Who invited you?

220
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,395
Oh, chocolates.

221
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,989
How sweet.

222
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,592
I heard you singing.

223
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,535
Yeah?

224
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,505
Yeah.
You're famous, right?

225
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,873
Trini Lopez...
that's who you are.

226
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,504
Yeah, that's me.
That's me.

227
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,878
You can call me Trini.

228
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,940
You're funny.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,452
But your pants
are even funnier.

230
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,420
What do you mean?
These are $5 pants.

231
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,082
Bad.

232
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,591
Bad? L'm not bad.
- Yeah.

233
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:57,221
L'm being me...
not mean, just honest.

234
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,455
Hey, man.
- Lil' bro.

235
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,490
What's up, man?
- You know, Hector, l'm so glad you could make it.

236
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,059
Thank you.
- Take it.

237
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,301
Little sister, I see you touching that,
l'm gonna kill you.

238
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,171
Yeah.
- Give us a minute.

239
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,836
Let me give you
a little brotherly advice:

240
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,078
Don't fuck with her

241
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,110
unless you're gonna
fuck with her.

242
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,985
Hey...

243
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,651
you wanna fuck with her,
fuck with her.

244
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,660
Got it?

245
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,389
Nice one, man.

246
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,797
Have fun.
- All right.

247
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,371
Look, l'll show you.

248
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,138
It's not like
a cigarette, man.

249
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,145
You gotta hold it
like this.

250
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,579
Go like this.

251
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,079
Hold it in?
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,756
How's that?
- For how long?

253
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,154
Do you feel anything?

254
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,064
Keep going.

255
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,946
# That I asked of you #

256
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:33,150
# to the best of your knowledge #

257
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,118
# if you knew that nowhere
in life was there... #

258
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,324
Are you okay?
- # Another love... #

259
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,164
No no no no! Not on the sofa.
Not on the sofa.

260
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,637
Okay.
- Okay?

261
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,576
Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Okay.

262
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,806
Come on.
- Okay.

263
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,838
Come on.
Are you okay?

264
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,817
Ooh. Okay.
- All right.

265
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,820
All right?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,822
Tell me your name,
baby.

267
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,756
Come on.

268
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,259
I don't want you to die
without knowing your name.

269
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,261
What's your name?
- Uh, Hector.

270
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,025
Hector. Hector what?
- Huh?

271
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,033
Hector what?
- Perez.

272
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,194
Hector Perez.
Okay.

273
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,763
Well, don't die on my birthday,
Hector Perez, okay?

274
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,577
Oh, man, I woke up
in her arms, man.

275
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,581
It was beautiful.

276
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,345
It was beautiful, man.
It was like...

277
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,750
I don't know, you know.
I just took care of business.

278
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,277
Yeah?
What kind of business?

279
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,915
Oh, man, just... just...
she gave me life back.

280
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,925
That good, huh?
- Damn, no.

281
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,154
Actually,
it was that bad.

282
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,426
We drank,
we smoked, we danced,

283
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,763
and then I threw up
all over the poor girl.

284
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,201
I was so high
and so dizzy, man.

285
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,636
I never wanna do
that shit again.

286
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,640
I didn't know
where I was.

287
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,904
I didn't know
who I was.

288
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,207
Oh, man, that's the best
impressión you can make

289
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,271
with Puerto Rican giris...
is being sick.

290
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,681
Marriage, brother,
marriage.

291
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,207
You vomit,
you marry.

292
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,618
They're natural-born
nurses, man.

293
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,915
I think
she liked me, man.

294
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,091
Jerry used to be a cop,
became a lawyer.

295
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,619
Now he's a...
now he's a thief,

296
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,529
robbing every
Latin musician blind,

297
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,262
but he's all we got, man.
That's all I gotta say.

298
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,894
Hold on, let me look at you
for a second, man.

299
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,905
Let me see.
No boogers...

300
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,930
you look good, man, decent, you know?
- No way.

301
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,408
Now, hey, we gotta be careful
in there, though.

302
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,843
You know, we just...
we'll just play it off

303
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,744
and, you know,
see where it takes us.

304
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,214
It's a big day.
- It's a big day for you.

305
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,739
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
- Big day for us.

306
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,378
First we cut a record
and then we do a tour.

307
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,446
It'll be a'60s approach...

308
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,253
...you know,
but Spanish.

309
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,952
Now we are a young company,
but, you know,

310
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,893
we're looking to do bigger
and better things, you know,

311
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,919
more mainstream things,
you know.

312
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,091
The black musicians
have, uh, Motown,

313
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,998
Stax Records.

314
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,332
Now the Latin musicians
are gonna have their own label...

315
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,803
Fania Records.
- Fania Records, yeah.

316
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,601
I know. L-l-l... I buy...
I buy your records, man.

317
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,665
Then you know
what you're getting into.

318
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,200
Now, Hector, do you have a lawyer?
- Yeah, we have a...

319
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,644
We have a good lawyer.
- Yeah.

320
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,579
Oh, okay, good good.
- Very... he's... he's...

321
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,743
he's very good. Yeah.
He's very good.

322
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,344
He's... he's...
but you're an honest guy,

323
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,821
so I didn't bring him,
you know?

324
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,985
L'm the only guy.

325
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,153
Mmm.
- There's one more thing...

326
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,425
and we all gave this
a lot of thought...

327
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,191
It wasn't me.

328
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,259
Me neither.

329
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,430
No no no, it's something
someone suggested

330
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,838
and I agree.

331
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,600
That name's
gotta go, man.

332
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,911
Who gotta go?
- Your name.

333
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,977
Uh, it really doesn't mean anything.
Uh, it's, uh... it's too common,

334
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,386
like Smith.

335
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,686
Perez is like Smith?

336
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,692
Uh, yes. Yes.

337
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,694
Um, it's, uh...

338
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,458
it's... it's like an unemployment-line name,
you know?

339
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,965
Oh, yeah.
- Uh, no offense.

340
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,695
And you want a name that the
unemployment line is gonna look up to.

341
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,862
Ah, like Smith.
L... I understand.

342
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,032
No no no.
Like Lavoe.

343
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,406
Like La what?

344
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,243
'La voe'...'the voice'
in French.

345
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,339
Yeah.
Sounds fancy.

346
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,543
But won't they think
l'm French or something,

347
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,075
singing in Spanish?
- No no no.

348
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,144
Hector, see, look, you're clearly
Puerto Rican. I mean,

349
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,019
you're gonna be...
- l'm just playing with you, man.

350
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,924
Come on, man.

351
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,928
He was corny.

352
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,760
He was funny.
He was corny.

353
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,165
I remember the first time
that we were together.

354
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,929
It was
very impressive.

355
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,962
Nothing but
the best for me.

356
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,880
Oh, Hector.

357
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:55,913
Oh, it hurts.
Oh, it hurts.

358
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,512
Yeah?
What, me?

359
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,490
No, the back seat.

360
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,515
Okay...

361
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,827
Oh, come on, baby.

362
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,237
You okay?

363
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,837
Yeah.

364
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,381
What's the first thing
you're gonna do?

365
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,385
When?

366
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,217
When you're famous,
silly.

367
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,156
Come here.

368
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,092
Why are you so sure
that l'm gonna be famous?

369
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,619
Because I know these things,
that's why.

370
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,391
I want a family.
And a brand-new Cadillac.

371
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,131
This way we don't have to
make love in this shit.

372
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,397
My brother
liked Cadillacs.

373
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,305
Whatever happened
to your brother?

374
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,711
He died
when he got here.

375
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,841
He was gonna
take care of me.

376
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:07,488
Well, we'll take care
of each other, okay?

377
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,159
Okay, let's eat, eh?
- Okay.

378
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,729
Babe, these are
the best beans in life.

379
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,673
The best beans.

380
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,370
Why do you think
I still live here?

381
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,140
L'm not going anywhere.

382
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,445
Where were you raised
on the island?

383
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,044
Oh, um, no,
on this island.

384
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,055
Here?
- Right here.

385
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,523
I don't even remember
what a palm tree looks like.

386
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,083
It doesn't matter where she was raised,
'cause she got me now...

387
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:46,223
palm trees, beaches,
pork hash... in person.

388
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,231
It's like Berlitz dining.

389
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,771
Maybe, uh,

390
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,899
one day l'll get back
to Puerto Rico. L'll get there.

391
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,706
What did I say?
You're there.

392
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,713
Next you'll meet
my father.

393
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,510
He thinks
he owns the island.

394
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,914
Doesn't he?

395
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,782
We're from Ponce.

396
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,787
All of our family
still lives there.

397
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,312
Hector and I are the only ones here.
- Mmm.

398
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,259
The only ones left.
- So...

399
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,922
how long have you guys
known each other?

400
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:22,058
Oh, days.

401
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,897
But it's destiny.

402
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,732
Mmm.

403
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,501
And your family?
They live here?

404
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,667
Mm-hmm.

405
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,678
Oh, I forgot.

406
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,681
You don't speak Spanish.

407
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,275
I do.
I do speak...

408
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,153
Well, what does
your family do?

409
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,487
Sell dope.

410
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,857
Yeah. Why, are you with the FBI
or something?

411
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,089
Because we should get that out of the way
right now. What are you...?

412
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,222
You know what, Hector?
I came here to eat, not to be grilled.

413
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,062
Ay, no. Ay no. No, hold on.

414
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,795
Priscilla's
with the Ponce police.

415
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,565
Babe, this has been
my life, okay? Lt's okay.

416
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,970
What do you mean, it's okay?
Lt's not okay.

417
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,445
Priscilla, what's with you?

418
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,447
L'm sorry.

419
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,278
I didn't mean
to come on that way.

420
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,945
L'm just trying to do what a mother,
a sister, a father has to do.

421
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,420
Don't take it
like that. L...

422
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,387
Okay?
We happy again?

423
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,357
We're home now.

424
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,833
We're gonna be living here,
all of us.

425
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,162
Let's not fight.

426
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,499
Let's be happy.

427
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,485
Musical conductor...
the great Johnny Pacheco!

428
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,162
One of the great
singers of Fania,

429
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,691
Hector Lavoe!

430
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,632
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

431
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,234
Willie Colon!

432
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,437
Willie!

433
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,070
Yeah, oh yeah.
Hey hey, Willie.

434
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,675
It's cool, l'll get you later,
faggot.

435
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,576
Come on.

436
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,019
Eddie? Hey...

437
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,718
It's happy hour,
bro.

438
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,159
You in or out, man?

439
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,737
Yeah, the wonder
of life, brother.

440
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,357
You like?

441
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,662
Babe, can you
move your ass

442
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,563
so that I can see
her ass, please?

443
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,590
You can't even handle
ass like that.

444
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,364
You wanna make a bet?
- This one you can touch.

445
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,271
This one you can have.
This one is yours.

446
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,002
That one... forget it.

447
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,306
Ay ay ay.

448
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,840
You don't wanna
change the channel?

449
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,187
Huh?
You wanna watch TV?

450
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,157
Is that what you want?

451
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,591
You wanna watch
Iris Chacon, baby?

452
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,618
Iris Chacon?

453
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,257
You don't wanna watch
'The Puchi Show'?

454
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,672
Do you think
this will end?

455
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,337
What?

456
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,370
This.

457
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,146
It just started,
didn't it?

458
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,016
I always wanted
somebody like you, Puchi.

459
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,017
Always.

460
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,920
Mm-hmm.

461
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,499
I have a surprise.
Hold on.

462
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,875
Oh, yeah?
'The Puchi Show.'

463
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:08,351
'The Puchi Show.'
'The Puchi Show.'

464
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,354
No no no no.
What are you, nuts?

465
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,585
Come on, you know
I don't like that stuff.

466
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,321
Put it away.

467
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,997
But you like me,
right?

468
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,268
# What a mess, eh #

469
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,794
# Boy boy boy boy boy #

470
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,967
# What a mess, eh #

471
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,034
# Boy boy boy boy boy #

472
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,707
# What a mess, eh #

473
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,875
# Boy boy boy boy boy #

474
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,681
# What a mess, eh #

475
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,188
# Boy boy boy boy boy. #

476
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,924
You don't wanna
make it too hot, though.

477
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,760
Oh, that... that's good, that's good.
- No no no no, that's good.

478
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,060
That's good.
- Yeah yeah.

479
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,397
Good, that's good.
You like it?

480
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,864
Right there it was...
it... it's good,

481
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,964
but trust me on this, it's...

482
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,374
It feels good to be a Nuyorican
holding up a trombone

483
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,971
instead of a tray or a hotel elevator.
- Yeah.

484
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,776
Mmm.
- That's some good shit, right?

485
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,749
Crime pays, Hector.
- Yeah.

486
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,810
You there?
- Stand by, guys. We're gonna listen.

487
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,186
Get her out of here. I believe that I was...
- The police is here?

488
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,850
The one who was invited to be here at 6:00.
- What's she doing?

489
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,882
Get her out of here.
Because I do own the place.

490
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,621
Her and Carmen are getting into a little altercation.
- Get out of here.

491
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,719
Hector.
- Who do you think you are?

492
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,923
Get her the fuck
out of here, Eddie.

493
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,488
I think you might need
some of this.

494
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,727
Did she recognize Carmen?
- Carmen's gone.

495
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,133
Eddie's taking her away.
- Get her out.

496
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,069
What is she doing now?

497
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,766
She's staring at us right now.
- Oh, shit. Okay.

498
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,275
Where are you going, bro?

499
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,140
I gotta go to the bathroom.
- Oh, shit, man.

500
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,406
Hi, Willie.
- Hello.

501
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,811
Hey.
- Hey, everybody.

502
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,042
Hey, Puchi, Puchi.

503
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,846
Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.

504
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,785
How are you doing?
- L'm okay.

505
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,344
I was just talking about you.
- Oh, really?

506
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,151
Yeah, I was looking
out the window

507
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,885
and I was looking
at the stars.

508
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,358
I don't see
no windows here.

509
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,519
No?
- No.

510
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,529
Well, you know what
the stars were saying?

511
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,087
What?
- The stars were saying,

512
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,066
'Puchi, I love you,
I love you, I love you.'

513
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,932
I heard that
in a soap opera once.

514
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,766
Oh, you haven't heard
nothing yet, baby.

515
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,773
Hector, stop it.
- Wha...

516
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,570
l'm late.

517
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,576
I was just talking
to Willie about that, babe.

518
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,840
Two hours you keep me
waiting like that.

519
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,870
Weeks late.

520
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,417
You gotta stop playing around
with silly little bitches, okay?

521
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:27,322
Let go.
Thank you.

522
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,349
L'll wait for you
outside.

523
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,906
He looked like an innocent
Jibaro choirboy,

524
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,638
but he wasn't,
let me tell you.

525
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:24,671
And we were both pregnant
for him at the same time.

526
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,707
The other woman in question...
at this point

527
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,015
it doesn't really matter
'cause that wasn't meant to be.

528
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,044
Right?

529
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,258
I mean,
I am the only woman.

530
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,854
I don't know who else was with him
for 20 years, do you?

531
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,094
You know something
I don't know?

532
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,114
If you put it
that way,

533
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,711
will you marry me,
Puchi?

534
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,881
L'm gonna marry this woman
because I love her.

535
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,161
Baby, yes, no?

536
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,464
Yes, you'd better
marry me.

537
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,160
The burundanga.

538
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,034
# That my buddy found #

539
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,326
# What a mess, eh #

540
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,354
# Boy boy boy boy boy #
- I love you.

541
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,299
# What a mess, eh #

542
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,495
# Boy boy boy boy boy. #

543
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,299
Wait.
- Here!

544
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,969
He'll be here.

545
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,911
Zaida, give me
a cigarette, please.

546
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,345
Here?

547
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,214
Okay okay okay.
Wait here.

548
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,077
Here.

549
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,214
It's okay,
Tito, baby.

550
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,236
Where is he?
You're the manager, right?

551
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,935
Baby, you look beautiful, Puchi.
Baby, beautiful.

552
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,274
Hector ain't
here yet, okay?

553
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,472
It took two years and a baby to get here.
Where the hell is he?

554
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,209
He's coming, baby.
Just calm down.

555
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,978
Were you
at the bachelor party?

556
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,951
Of course I was in the bachelor party.
Baby, calm down.

557
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,817
You're in a church.
- You're telling me to calm down?

558
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,118
L'm getting married here.
You see there's a wedding going on here

559
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,751
and he's not here yet?
What kind of managing is that?

560
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,555
# A la la le #

561
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:30,897
# A la la le le le le le #

562
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,301
# La. #

563
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,042
Hey, Puchi.
- Oh shit.

564
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,308
Hey hey, Puchi.

565
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,110
Puchi...
- Shut up, Eddie.

566
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,140
I called you. Y-you didn't call me back.
- Shut up.

567
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,714
What?
- Willie, where's the ring?

568
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,882
Where's that...
where... where's the ring?

569
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,687
Get the ring.
- Oh, man. Fuck.

570
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,895
Hector.
Hector!

571
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,025
Stand up, honey.
We're getting married.

572
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,126
Come on, get up.
- Aren't we married already?

573
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,160
Uh, do you, Hector...

574
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,173
He does.
Hector, say 'I do.'

575
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,765
I do.

576
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,332
Do you, Puchi...
- I do.

577
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,604
Anybody object?

578
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,545
Sorry, Father,

579
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,413
there's no more beer left?
Are you sure?

580
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,314
There.
- I think it's best

581
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,717
if I now
pronounce you...

582
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,984
...man and wife.

583
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,888
This one?
- That one.

584
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:31,154
Thank you very much.

585
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,628
Where is she?

586
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,858
Ah, God, look.

587
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,000
# Sing, my people #

588
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,268

00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,209

# Sing, my people. #

# Oh lei lei, lei lei lei lei,

00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:42,685
# Lei lei... #

# La la la,

628
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,911
But people loved him.

629
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,219
It was like,
with all his faults

630
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,157
and all his
fuck-ups,

631
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,923
it just made him more
like one of them.

632
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,657
And it was funny,
you know.

633
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,030
It was like
the bigger Hector got,

634
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,694
the more he grew
as an artist,

635
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,068
it was like the deeper
he sank as a person,

636
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:36,665
as a human being,
you know what I mean?

637
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,505
He was like,

638
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,340
I don't know.

639
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,450
Why aren't there lights over here?
- I can reach it. I can reach it.

640
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,684
Okay, perfect.
- There we go.

641
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,693
Oh, look, it's almost like sitting on it.
Right, boy?

642
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,422
Yeah.
- It's cute.

643
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:01,795
Santa, remember
Tito's train, please!

644
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,800
The boy forgot.

645
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:07,429
And he really
wants one.

646
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,439
He forgot to put it
in his letter.

647
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:12,442
He only told me this morning.
Please.

648
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,444
He's been
such a good boy.

649
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,742
What do you think?
Is that gonna work?

650
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,749
I got connections, son.

651
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,116
Santa... we...
we go way back.

652
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,018
# December's here again #

653
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:28,047
# That means it's time
for Christmas #

654
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,426
# Children wait
for Santa #

655
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:37,628
# Reindeer
and his sleigh... #

656
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,636
Who's there?

657
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,638
# Grandma likes to decorate... #
- Who is it?

658
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,106
# While everyone celebrates... #
- Is that Santa Claus?

659
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,109
# Christmas... #
- Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

660
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,735
Tito, look!

661
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,473
This is all for you,
little boy...

662
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,640
a present
from Santa Claus.

663
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,048
Tell his father he's a good boy.
- Okay.

664
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,314
Oh ho ho ho
ho ho ho ho!

665
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,719
Agh!

666
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,553
L'm okay.

667
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:12,292
# Lo lai le lo le, lo lai le lo la #

668
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,634
# Though you don't want me to #

669
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,334
# I came to sing #

670
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,274
# And cheer everyone up #

671
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,744
# With a voice of happiness #

672
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,909
# I bring harmony to
your sacred home #

673
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,612
# Let me bring harmony #

674
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,450
# To your sacred home. #

675
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,416
Number one, baby.

676
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,127
To life!

677
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,435
# This ain't living,
this ain't living #

678
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,443
# No no, baby... #

679
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,536
That's it.
- # This ain't living... #

680
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,047
# No no no no #

681
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,878
# Inflation #

682
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,888
# No chance... #
- Whoo! Yeah, baby.

683
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,651
# To increase... #

684
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,126
# Finance #

685
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,755
# Bills pile up
sky high... #

686
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,856
That finger, man.

687
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,628
# Send that boy off #

688
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,693
# To die #

689
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,068
# Oh, make me
wanna holler... #

690
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,595
# The way they do my life #
- She's acting like a whore, Willie.

691
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,403
Hey, don't dance for her.

692
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,842
# Yeah, make me wanna holler #
- Don't dance with her, make her dance for you.

693
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,812
# The way they do
my life #

694
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,404
# Oh, baby... #

695
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,485
No, it was the '70s.
We all did it.

696
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,580
When I first met Hector,
I didn't do anything, though.

697
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,318
I didn't...
I did nothing.

698
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,986
I didn't drink. I didn't smoke.
I didn't do nothing.

699
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,551
But then, you know...

700
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,120
Whoo!

701
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,655
We had a good time.

702
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,225
Yeah.
Ah!

703
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,861
She has pretty hair.
- She does, right?

704
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,134
Yeah.
- Right.

705
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,505
You always wanted to be
with a woman, right?

706
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,512
Why, you like that?

707
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,043
L'd like that.
Come on.

708
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,182
Okay, but you
go first, okay?

709
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:50,318
With him.

710
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,795
Are you fucking retarded
or something?

711
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,855
Come on, babe, it will turn me on.
- What the fuck?

712
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,490
What's wrong with that?
- That's Willie. That's a fucking man.

713
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,592
It'll turn me on.
You do him...

714
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,263
Yeah yeah.
...and then l'll do her.

715
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,498
I don't wanna make you jealous.
- Okay?

716
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,836
I don't know what's, uh,
normal for other people,

717
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,705
but it was normal
for us.

718
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,176
#... lt makes me
wanna holler #

719
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,441
# And throw up
both my hands #

720
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,504
# Oh, ow! #

721
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:13,038
# Panic #

722
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,017
# Is spreading #

723
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:17,282
# God knows where #

724
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,779
# We're heading, oh... #

725
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,226
Great. Great.
Just great.

726
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,126
L'm not his babysitter,
Ralphie.

727
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,391
L'm his wife,
in case you forgot.

728
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,661
How could I forget?
You remind me every day.

729
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,361
Then go get him.
- Ralphie...

730
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,893
Get in your car, Ralphie, and go get him
if you know where he is.

731
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:36,167
Ralphie, give her a break, man.
- Tonight's not another night.

732
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,231
I don't care if he makes you wait.
He's not gonna make me wait.

733
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,140
Oh, fuck you very much, Willie.
- I worked too hard

734
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:42,543
to get to stand on that fucking stage.
- Oh, did you really, Willie?

735
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,980
Why is she here?
- Hello, you know, Willie's right.

736
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,211
You know,
he's fucking up again, as usual.

737
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,982
Did... did anybody ask
for their money back?

738
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,512
I don't know, Eddie.
Were they upstairs at the ticket office

739
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:55,388
asking for their money back?
Did they?

740
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,394
No, Puchi.
No, but one day they will.

741
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,659
Fuck, man. The dog ate
the car keys, man.

742
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,189
I had to borrow the neighbor's car to get here, man.
- That's a good one.

743
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,428
Hi, babe.
- You don't have a dog.

744
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,937
Everybody, just give us
a fucking second!

745
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,996
Oh, fuck you.
- Are you fucking happy with yourself?

746
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,803
I don't know. What did I do, man?
Lt's a true story.

747
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,605
Don't fucking listen to them.
- It's me, Hector, not the others.

748
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,976
I like to fuck around too,
but I take this seriously.

749
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,503
Oh, so do I, man.

750
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,914
Willie, you're gonna have
a heart attack, man.

751
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,111
Relax.
- Hector, I wanted you in my band

752
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,382
because I saw you had
a one-in-a-million voice.

753
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,218
And you're a good man.
You're my best friend, my family.

754
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,553
And we've gotten far.

755
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,321
Listen, you wanna fuck yourself up,
you do it on your own time,

756
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,124
not on mine, you understand?
You need help... l'll help,

757
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,131
but you gotta
help me too.

758
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,133
You know, Willie,

759
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,567
I think you're talking
to the wrong guy.

760
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,400
It's me. Yeah.
- Yeah? Lt's you?

761
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,303
Fuck you, 'it's you.'
I know it's you.

762
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,137
L'm not Puchi.
L'm not Jerry.

763
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,904
L'm not Ralph.
It's me.

764
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,912
I love you, man.

765
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,914
If this is about love,
you try loving yourself.

766
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,745
I get plenty of love
and I still get here on time.

767
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,842
All right.
- All right? L'm your brother.

768
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,614
Yeah.
- Come on, let's kill'em.

769
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,416
Did you wash your fucking hands?
- Yeah, they're clean.

770
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,218
Let's go.
We're ready.

771
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,225
Are you ready, New York?

772
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,160
The Fania All-Stars!

773
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:19,006
Um, l'm really lucky I have you.

774
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,168
I know.

775
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,269
Oh, well maybe...
maybe I don't.

776
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,337
I was driving here
tonight...

777
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,612
and I almost hit a fucking cow.

778
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,518
Shut the fuck up.

779
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,616
Eh, what?

780
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,627
You got a question or something?

781
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,630
Wow, relax.
The president curses. He lies.

782
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,029
Where were you?

783
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,659
Uh-huh.

784
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,177
Check it out.

785
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:04,652
# Get out of the way
so I can take your place #

786
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:06,679
# Get out of the way #

787
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,958
# Get out of the way
so I can take your place #

788
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,895
# Get out of the way #

789
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,361
# Let the girlies dance #

790
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:24,033
# So they can have a good time,
yeah man #

791
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,872
# I don't care what they say #

792
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,904
# Because l'm a shark #

793
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,884
# Get out of the way
so I can take your place #

794
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,476
# Get out of the way #

795
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,954
# Get out of the way
so I can take your place #

796
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,289
# Get out of the way. #

797
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,705
I want my money.

798
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,678
After the show...
my money.

799
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,954
Get 'em, Willie Colon.

800
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,377
Let the music play on!

801
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:10,039
Let music roll. Yeah!

802
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:16,949
Ah, Puerto Rico, man.

803
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:18,978
Is Puerto Rico
your home?

804
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,422
You can call this Nuyorico.

805
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,518
Oh, you like to be here!

806
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,863
Babe, you believe this?

807
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,872
Lt's crazy.

808
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:37,771
I always did, remember?

809
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:42,045
Oh, yeah.
I love you, babe.

810
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,980
And you're here
with me.

811
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,408
I love you too.

812
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,989
Even when it looks
like I don't...

813
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,056
I do.

814
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,086
I know.

815
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,395
That for Christmas?

816
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:06,061
For later.

817
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,400
Yeah?
- Or for now.

818
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,029
Ahoooo!

819
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,675
Hey, fuck you.

820
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,668
Fuck you.

821
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,978
Hello?

822
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,383
L'm back.

823
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,121
Hector.

824
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,065
Tito?

825
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,912
Hey, Mom.
- Where's your father?

826
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,177
I don't know.
He was here somewhere.

827
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,415
Puchi, enough, bitch.
Leave me alone.

828
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,886
Your son could have started a fire!
- Leave me the fuck alone, man.

829
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,082
You could have started a fire too!
- Puchi, enough.

830
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,990
At 10:00 at night, he's over there eating alone!
- The baby was fine.

831
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,324
The gas is on...
- He was fine before you got here, huh?

832
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,726
...while you're doing
Lord knows what.

833
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,821
This is our home.
- The baby...

834
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,388
What about this?
- Enough.

835
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,696
You leave this around? What,
you're starting to believe that shit?

836
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,395
What's wrong with you?
- Ah, please, Puchi. Papi...

837
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,768
What, are you that big fucking guy
on the album cover now,

838
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,830
you can't even put it away?
- Papo gave me that fucking gun, okay?

839
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,172
Who fucking cares who gave it to you?
- Oh, fuck you, man.

840
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,508
This is bullshit. Fuck it.
- Oh, that's right. Go ahead, leave.

841
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,274
Yeah, okay.
- Walk away just like you always do.

842
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,009
Nothing happened.
- Don't fucking say...

843
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,176
Your father doesn't fucking hate you,
your mother's not dead and...

844
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,813
and your brother's in Harlem scoring dope somewhere.
- Yeah? Enough!

845
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,720
Who the fuck
do you think you are, huh?

846
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,520
You wanna be a man?
You wanna be a fucking man, huh?

847
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,027
Be a man. Huh?

848
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,495
Shut up.
Get out.

849
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,327
Ah, yes.
- Get out. Get out.

850
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,765
Why don't you get out?
Get out. Get out!

851
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,530
Now! I said...
- Listen to me. Shut the fuck up.

852
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,093
Listen to me.
- Get out!

853
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,628
Oh, yeah. Huh?
- Let go of me. Let go of me, Hector.

854
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,334
Huh, Puchi?
Huh?

855
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,343
L'm gonna
tell you something.

856
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:30,505
You're finally going
to listen to me, okay?

857
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,708
Fuck you!

858
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,649
How's that?

859
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,287
Whore, fuck it.

860
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,994
Doorman?
Yes, is this the doorman?

861
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,523
Don't give him
his keys.

862
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,468
No, he's drunk.
Okay?

863
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,494
Yeah, no.
Thank you.

864
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,133
I know it's tough, bro,

865
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,401
but you have
two problems.

866
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,601
And I don't know
which one's harder to quit.

867
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,873
You?
Me neither, man.

868
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,340
But one'll kill you.

869
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,056
And I love her.

870
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,058
I can't help it,
you know?

871
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,253
I think she loves
you too, man.

872
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,921
We had a great show
last night,

873
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,897
gonna have
another one tonight.

874
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,899
It's all
gonna be good.

875
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,458
We got so much more
to do, bro,

876
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,663
and you're right there,
front and center, bro.

877
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,139
And l'm right
behind you, you know?

878
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,233
I got your back, bro.

879
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,082
Hector, I just...

880
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:19,612
I just want you to say that
you're gonna try to make it work.

881
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:23,251
I want you to say that you're
gonna spend more time with Tito.

882
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,228
I want you to say that you're
gonna stop with all the drugs.

883
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,323
And I want you to say
that you love me,

884
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,358
because
I love you, baby,

885
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,802
and I want us
to be together.

886
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,236
Is that too much?

887
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,904
Isn't that what you want?
- You know what's funny is that...

888
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,711
l'm not the only one
fucking up here, Puchi.

889
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,051
You know that.

890
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,451
Puchi, you want it all,

891
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,082
but I can't promise you
all that...

892
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,092
all that in one night.
I can't.

893
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,926
L'd be lying to you,
baby.

894
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,488
And you can't either.
You can't sit there with a straight face

895
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,399
and tell me that you're ready
to promise all that either.

896
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,426
There's no way.

897
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,503
I don't like talking
about what hurts me.

898
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,512
That's just
the way I am,

899
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,912
and you know that.
And you don't like it either.

900
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,680
That's us.

901
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,751
Look...

902
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,024
Look at me.

903
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:49,572
What we had was like an old-fashioned
type of love, you know?

904
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,342
Not like this new...
this new-wave

905
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,681
soulmate type of shit,
you know?

906
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,687
It was good.
It was bad.

907
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,211
It was beautiful.

908
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,894
And for the first time
in our lives

909
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,092
we had everything
that we'd never had.

910
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,333
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking,

911
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,705
but love is never perfect
when it's real love, all right?

912
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,370
Lt's not his problem.

913
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,743
It's not his problem.
It's your problem.

914
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,839
Jerry, please.
- And you're my problem.

915
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,976
Please, bro.
- This is the last time he does this.

916
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,043
Let's go, let's go!

917
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,592
Hey, what's going on?

918
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,542
Willie.

919
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:05,052
Fuck, man, you're not gonna
believe this shit.

920
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,919
You're not gonna
believe this shit, man.

921
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,184
You're right, I won't.

922
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:09,816
Hey, what's with you, man?

923
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:12,020
Huh? No no no.
Listen, let me explain it...

924
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,426
Brother, let me explain to you.
- Hec...

925
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:14,953
This is not another
story, man, really.

926
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:18,024
Hector, bro, this is the third time
this month.

927
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,262
I can't deal with your
crazy shit anymore, man.

928
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,134
I quit.
The band is yours.

929
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,403
It's that simple.
You can be late all you want to.

930
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,740
Wait a minute, look, let's go someplace.
Let's go someplace, man.

931
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,608
Let's smoke a joint.
Let's talk, just me and you, plea...

932
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,137
Brother, I-I was stuck in traffic, man.
- Yeah?

933
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,980
Please believe me.
- I told Ralphie to cancel all our gigs.

934
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,952
L'm moving on.
You do the same.

935
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:40,319
L'll work with you,
but not on the same stage.

936
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,191
Go home, Hector.
- You're making a mistake, man.

937
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,458
Eh, you know what? Fuck you.

938
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,731
Just get some rest, man.

939
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:55,533
# The festival and the chapel
with their chanting #

940
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,564
# Highlight the emotion
of the town #

941
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:01,805
# And the trembling lustful
notice #

942
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,403
# Catalina la O... #

943
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,971
This is the best thing
that could have happened, okay?

944
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,710
Now is your time, okay?

945
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,345
He is nothing without you.
Fuck him, all right?

946
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,548
Lt's not that... it's not that you
were always late.

947
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,615
It's that he was
always too early.

948
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,252
It's a lot more
than that, Puchi.

949
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,592
It's a lot
more than that.

950
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,394
I mean, Will...
W-Willie was like my brother.

951
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,764
I know he was
like your brother

952
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:27,292
and he'll always be
like your brother, okay?

953
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,033
You are the show.
Everybody knows that, Hector.

954
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,700
Let him go out there
and try and sing with that

955
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,902
squeaky little voice of his
and see how far he gets.

956
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,241
Forget it.
It's his loss.

957
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,442
All right?

958
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:41,450
This had to happen.

959
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,577
This is the way it's
supposed to be, okay?

960
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,521
Lt's gonna be
all right, baby.

961
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,947
Now 'the man who opens his mouth'
is going to sing,

962
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,959
Hector Lavoe, come on!

963
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:32,195
By 1975, Hector had
recorded 12 albums;

964
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,170
he had seven
number-one hits;

965
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:38,230
he had drugs; he had a wife;
he had a kid;

966
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,970
he had a family;
he had other women...

967
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,410
everything you need for a good guy
to break down.

968
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,539
Go away,

969
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,447
take a vacation.

970
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,921
Hector?

971
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,061
Baby, are you okay?

972
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,131
Lt's okay.

973
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:21,040
Imagine you wake up
in the middle of the night

974
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:23,848
and you see your husband

975
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:26,252
just sitting there like he's a character
from a horror movie.

976
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,587
And all you can
think is,

977
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,957
'Shit, it's my fault.'

978
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,197
He was hurting inside. He couldn't...
he couldn't hold it in anymore,

979
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,201
you know?
So his body...

980
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,033
his body
just shut down.

981
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,596
Men like Hector, they don't...
they don't get therapy.

982
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:48,168
They don't go to AA
or anything like that, you know?

983
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:50,702
But we... we... nobody
ever knew about that stuff

984
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:52,840
because we kept
our private lives very private.

985
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,910
Mom, are we going
to the hospital today?

986
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,388
Uh, no, sweetie,
not today.

987
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,618
Next week. Next week.
- You always say that.

988
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,127
I know, but...

989
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,097
but I promise.

990
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,758
Come on, honey, be good.
Just get dressed.

991
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,767
L'll be there
in two minutes.

992
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,769
I love you.

993
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,815
Going to a dance?

994
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,689
You know,
he's your brother,

995
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:38,853
but he's my husband too.

996
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,557
So give me
a break, okay?

997
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,565
I wish I could,

998
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,567
but you know,
from the first day you met him,

999
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,398
and from the first day
I met you,

1000
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,268
I had a bad feeling.

1001
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,432
His father never
wanted him to come here

1002
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,272
so he'd never have to
meet people like you.

1003
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,938
I always wanted to tell you that.
- Well, you said it.

1004
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:59,607
Are you happy now?
You know what? Ciao, Priscilla.

1005
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,480
Mind your business.
Go get fucked and all that.

1006
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,111
You know, you may not like my kind,
but he doesn't seem to mind it much.

1007
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,781
Yeah?
Look where he is.

1008
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:34,644
I hate the food
in this place, man.

1009
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,745
How's Tito?

1010
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:45,058
Does he listen
to you?

1011
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,324
Yeah.

1012
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,937
I miss you.

1013
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,831
I miss you.

1014
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,245
I do.

1015
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,612
Do I look
crazy to you?

1016
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,959
Baby, let's go home.

1017
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,167
Dad!
- Hey, son.

1018
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,567
Oh, Ave Maria.
You look good.

1019
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,798
I missed you, boy.

1020
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,000
Look at you.

1021
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,009
Look at this.

1022
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,034
Looks like my grandfather's
night table.

1023
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,814
Well, take your medication.

1024
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:42,317
I don't want you
going crazy on me tonight.

1025
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,319
No?

1026
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:47,151
Okay.

1027
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,454
Ralphie called.

1028
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,921
What did he want?

1029
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:58,491
What do you think?
Had a bunch of stuff lined up...

1030
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:02,334
shows in Los Ángeles,
Europe, Caracas,

1031
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:06,865
you know.
But I spoke to him. I handled it.

1032
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,810
They're not gonna be
fucking with you like they did before.

1033
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,378
I told him that first
you had to get back

1034
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,851
to spending time
with your son...

1035
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,980
making love
to your wife.

1036
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:38,663
You hear me?

1037
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,388
What is it, baby?
You nervous?

1038
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,792
Yeah.

1039
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,229
L'm...
l'm straight.

1040
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:04,893
That makes me nervous.

1041
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:10,066
I know.

1042
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,249
Hope you're listening.

1043
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:32,878
Yes.

1044
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,163
Mm-hmm.

1045
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:06,313
# Aguanile #

1046
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:14,126
# Aguanile #

# Aguanile aguanile may may #

# Aguanile aguanile

1060
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,434
You ever seen a coqui sing?

1061
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,902
Seen one in the Bronx? No.

1062
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,133
That's right.
You've never seen one

1063
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,141
because you can't
see them.

1064
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,268
They're there.
You can hear them,

1065
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:17,279
but you can't
see them.

1066
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,543
And they only sing
one song.

1067
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,040
And it's two notes...

1068
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:25,110
Just like that, all their life,
their whole life.

1069
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:27,122
They're born
to do that.

1070
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,249
And they live everywhere
in Puerto Rico.

1071
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:32,454
And they can't survive
anywhere else in the worid.

1072
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,997
I guess you're a little bit
like the coqui, huh, Hector?

1073
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,901
Fuck, man,
you can be depressing.

1074
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,371
Yeah.

1075
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,704
Look at me.
What, am I in love with a frog?

1076
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,772
Don't be, you know,
fucking depressing.

1077
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,750
Don't be depressing?

1078
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,342
Instead of...

1079
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,944
I have a dyslexic one.
He goes...

1080
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,472
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Corso.

1081
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,378
We have a surprise guest
for you tonight...

1082
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,383
Mr. Ruben Blades.

1083
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,546
Hello.
L'm Ruben Blades

1084
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:36,024
and tonight l'm here
to give someone a present.

1085
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:39,789
I wrote this song
for Hector Lavoe,

1086
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,092
someone I really admired
since I was a kid

1087
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,598
who wanted to be
a singer.

1088
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,430
I remember when I went over there to
Panama with Willie Colon.

1089
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,699
Damn.
- After I sing it for you, it's his.

1090
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,366
It's called
'El Cantante.'

1091
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,979
It goes like this.

1092
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:01,278
# A la le #

1093
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,684
# Le le #

1094
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,269
# My best testaments #

1095
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:09,410
# Today I dedicate to you #

1096
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,436
# My best testaments #

1097
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,619
# Today I dedicate to you #

1098
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:21,282
# My best testaments #

1099
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:28,355
# Today I dedicate to you #

1100
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,627
# My best testaments. #

1101
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,432
Hey, look,
l'm buying...

1102
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,704
What the fuck...?!

1103
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,808
Pay him off.

1104
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,985
Hector,
baby, you here?

1105
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:35,223
Hector.

1106
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,754
Hi, honey.

1107
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,959
Ah, look who's here.

1108
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,459
My favorite little whore,
just like I like it.

1109
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:44,563
What's gotten into you?
You crazy?

1110
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:47,166
Nah, where were you, babe?
- In a sexy mood?

1111
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,177
Where were you, baby?
- I was... what?

1112
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,769
And you're st...
- I was at my sister's house.

1113
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,042
And you're stoned too, yeah?
- No.

1114
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:54,480
Oh.
- I left Tito over there.

1115
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,040
And you're stoned.
You got stoned at your sis...

1116
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,915
No.
- How is she?

1117
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,080
No, I got chicken. She's good.
- Yeah? She's...

1118
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,749
Zaida's good.
- She's good?

1119
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,950
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. And...

1120
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,151
You look nice.
- Thank you.

1121
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,489
Yeah, I b...
I bought you chicken.

1122
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,257
You hungry?
- Dressed like that?

1123
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,128
What?
- Looking like that,

1124
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,133
you were at your
sister's house?

1125
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,896
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

1126
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,700
Yes.
- You look like a whore.

1127
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,103
Like a whore?

1128
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:20,370
And since when
don't you like it?

1129
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:23,105
You wanna... you wanna eat here
or you wanna eat in the kitchen?

1130
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,943
I got you wings and thighs

1131
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,778
and everything.
What do you want? I got potatoes.

1132
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,717
L'm good.

1133
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,516
Come on. You know, I was gonna
surprise you at the club,

1134
01:16:33,555 --> 01:16:35,022
but then I went by there
and you weren't there.

1135
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:37,048
Where the fuck
were you, huh?!

1136
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,193
Smile, smile.

1137
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,962
Okay, you got it,
you got it.

1138
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,165
Give me some more.
Give me some more.

1139
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:57,671
Oh, get out of here.

1140
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:58,975
All right, look this way.

1141
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,982
What?

1142
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:03,041
No, huh-uh.
- Good job, good job.

1143
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:08,614
Bye.

1144
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,161
Tell me
he doesn't look crazy.

1145
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,959
I mean, I think
he looks a little crazy,

1146
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,193
but it's gonna work.
I don't know.

1147
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,174
Baby, do the sad face.

1148
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,039
Like this...

1149
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,108
Hold on, hold on. Don't even take it.
- Take five.

1150
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,450
This is exactly
where we wanna be.

1151
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,750
It makes me crack up

1152
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:41,722
when you do
that funny face.

1153
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:43,918
Who was on the phone?
- Huh?

1154
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:45,859
Who were you
talking to on the phone?

1155
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:47,919
Nobody.
- Oh, nobody?

1156
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,363
No. Nothing.
- Huh? No? Fucking whore, damn it.

1157
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,196
Who was it,
the fucking piano player?

1158
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:54,202
Huh?
What, the bass player?

1159
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,329
Who the fuck was
on the phone, Puchi?

1160
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,202
What are you
talking about?

1161
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,707
What am I talking about?

1162
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,208
Don't do this here, please.
- Don't do this here?

1163
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,871
Come on. Go over there.
- What are you doing?

1164
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,039
Hold it in. Puchi, don't do that.
Damn it. Walk.

1165
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,644
What, you really wanna
know who l'm fucking?

1166
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,176
Okay.
All of them.

1167
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,711
The bass player, the drummer,
the congo player... all of them.

1168
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,724
All of them
except the singer.

1169
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,419
Yeah.

1170
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:21,486
Because the singer
is always too high to get it up.

1171
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,225
That's why.
You know what?

1172
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,426
You accuse me
of fucking so many men

1173
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,265
that l'm finally gonna fuck
all the men that l'm accused of fucking.

1174
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,271
Okay?

1175
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,822
# I have not seen you
in so long... #

1176
01:20:04,733 --> 01:20:06,667
Okay.

1177
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:16,272
I just wanted you
to be proud of me,

1178
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,871
but from what I see,
fuck it, eh?

1179
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,448
Go ahead, give it to him.

1180
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,081
Here.
- What is it?

1181
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,989
He made it for you
in shop at school.

1182
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:32,425
How nice.
- You like it?

1183
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,690
That's perfect, son.
I wanna take it everywhere with me.

1184
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:36,390
Thanks, man.

1185
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:39,059
Don't worry, my feelings
are not hurt or anything.

1186
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,125
There goes...
there goes mommy.

1187
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:44,036
I love you too, Ma.
- I love you, baby.

1188
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,040
Show him your dance.
I know you're dying to do your dance.

1189
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,371
Go ahead.
- Do I have to? No.

1190
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,104
Just don't laugh at me.
- Okay, son.

1191
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,078
Please don't laugh at me.
- No, I won't say...

1192
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:52,579
Don't laugh at me.

1193
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:03,480
Look, why don't you
let me help you?

1194
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,016
That's what a wife does.
Just let me.

1195
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,087
L'm gonna take you
on tour with me.

1196
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,496
I don't wanna see
any more doctors, okay?

1197
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,900
Lt's not a doctor.
It's nothing like that, I promise.

1198
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:16,563
Puchi, can I enjoy
watching my son, please?

1199
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:18,869
Lt's better
than any doctor, huh?

1200
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,139
I enjoy this.
I won't break.

1201
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,611
I know you enjoy this,
but how about him?

1202
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:28,082
Oh, damn.
- Since you only see him once every six months,

1203
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,584
and even when you're home... don't think
I don't know you're fucking high, Hector.

1204
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,382
Puchi, God, don't start
with that shit, man.

1205
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,048
? What's with you, man?
Huh? L'm trying to fucking relax.

1206
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,388
Or maybe I should go somewhere else
to relax 'cause I can't relax

1207
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,393
in this fucking house. I can't do a goddamn thing, man.
- Yeah, that's a good idea,

1208
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,122
maybe another rehab.
Or maybe you should go

1209
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,027
to one of those fucking whores
who keep fucking calling the house.

1210
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,225
Enough, damn it, Puchi.
It's enough! Damn it!

1211
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,894
#... Baby, that's plenty #

1212
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:48,664
# And never has one man
rocked so many #

1213
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,933
# l'ma make you wet
then make you sweat #

1214
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:52,906
# Just to see
how funky you can get #

1215
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:55,205
# Now when l'm on the mic,
I do serve well #

1216
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,143
# And I go by the name of the... #

1217
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,875
What the fuck, man?

1218
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,897
L'm sorry, son.

1219
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,903
Oh, man.

1220
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:24,462
Oh, this can be fixed.
Look.

1221
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:27,100
Oh, we can fix this, son.
With a little Crazy Glue we'll fix this.

1222
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,871
Look look look look.
All the pieces are here.

1223
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:30,241
It's okay.

1224
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,508
Son, it's not okay,
okay?

1225
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,640
I mean,
I was a warrior,

1226
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,117
but that was one battle
that I never won.

1227
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:40,280
Your son... he can't keep seeing
his mother and father like this.

1228
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:48,295
Do it for him.

1229
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,026
Don't do it for me.
Don't do it for you.

1230
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:53,057
Do it for him.

1231
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:56,727
He loves you.

1232
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,364
He needs a father.

1233
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,840
But he couldn't do it.

1234
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:10,749
Maybe deep down he didn't want to.
I don't know.

1235
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,713
Maybe you didn't
want him to change.

1236
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:17,350
Why the fuck wouldn't I
want him to change?

1237
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:23,192
That was...
that's so stupid.

1238
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:26,667
He was my husband. Of course I wanted...
I wanted him to be better.

1239
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,226
I think you owe me
an apology.

1240
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:37,343
God knows when you got it.
It doesn't matter.

1241
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:41,338
But yeah, the H.I.V. Test
came back positive.

1242
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,057
Uh...

1243
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,788
l'm really sorry, man.

1244
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:56,388
And Puchi?

1245
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:03,999
Well, the doctor says
that the... the disease

1246
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,234
might not show
symptoms for years

1247
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:09,038
or even...
maybe never.

1248
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,773
He doesn't know
how long l've had it.

1249
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:23,323
He said that you should
get yourself tested...

1250
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,151
just in case.

1251
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,163
I don't want anybody
to know about this.

1252
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:56,279
What's in the future
for Hector Lavoe?

1253
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:58,724
L'm looking forward to
the best years of my life,

1254
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,785
you know.
Think about it, look around...

1255
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,093
every year's supposed to be
'the Latin boom,' you know,

1256
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,793
and now young musicians
come and make money.

1257
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,893
And then, you know...

1258
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,598
l'll go back home
and be myself,

1259
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,629
just a nobody.

1260
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,344
I was thinking, man...
I was thinking of getting

1261
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,474
an apartment in Jersey or something...
a small little place, you know?

1262
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:31,719
I can't stay, man.
L'm more afraid to go.

1263
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:38,832
There's somebody here tonight
that's trying to hide from us,

1264
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:41,529
but it's not working.

1265
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:45,027
Hector, come on, man.
Come up and sing.

1266
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,473
You're under arrest.
You can't run.

1267
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:52,145
Come on, we really do need
a good singer up here.

1268
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,307
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

1269
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,340
Hector Lavoe.

1270
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:04,592
# Because your love is
my backbone #

1271
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:07,754
# In all four corners #

1272
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:11,526
# They talk about us #

1273
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:16,232
# They say this is
a scandal #

1274
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:19,138
# And even put me down #

1275
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:24,476
# For loving you #

1276
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,312
# Pay no attention
to the people #

1277
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:31,045
# Stay the course #

1278
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:35,715
# And love me even more #

1279
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:40,051
# l've had enough of this #

1280
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,688
# Let's move on #

1281
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:47,861
# Without knowing
what they'll say #

1282
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:51,633
# If I could one day #

1283
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:58,879
# I would climb up to the stars #

1284
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:03,614
# I would take you with me #

1285
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:11,087
# To where nobody could see us. #

1286
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:20,601
Excuse me.

1287
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,126
Don't touch me.
Get off me.

1288
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:24,763
Come on, let's go. Don't make me take you out.
- What are you doing?

1289
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:25,864
Hey.
- Let's go.

1290
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:27,772
Motherfucker, get off.
- Come on, calm down.

1291
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:30,141
Look what they're doing
to your wife, faggot.

1292
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:32,942
Do something, you chunky little faggot.
- Puchi, Puchi, what are you doing?

1293
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:36,477
Get off!
- Let's go. That's... okay, come here. Come here.

1294
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:40,283
Hey, Puchi, Puchi, no.
- Leave me alone, you piece of shit!

1295
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,118
Come on.
- You can't even be a husband.

1296
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:44,681
You can't even be
a father.

1297
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,297
Gentlemen.
- You coward.

1298
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,663
Puchi, come on, let's go.

1299
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:56,897
Huh? Hey. Fuck!
- Leave me alone, please.

1300
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,428
Puchi.

1301
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:01,636
He can't even be a father.
- Puchi, enough, damn it! Puchi.

1302
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:03,644
You don't have a son!

1303
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:06,909
You hear me?

1304
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,815
You don't have a son.

1305
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,816
It was an accident.

1306
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,597
He was shot in the stomach

1307
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,622
with the gun...

1308
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,832
by his best friend.

1309
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:35,436
Well, anyway, I don't like to talk
about that too much.

1310
01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:37,467
You know, l'm...

1311
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,873
I just...

1312
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:43,679
I don't remember too much
from that year anyway.

1313
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,985
It was...

1314
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,217
Don't talk to me like l'm your grandmother.
L'm your mother

1315
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:52,089
and if I ask you where you're going,
then you tell me

1316
01:28:52,126 --> 01:28:54,788
where the fuck you're going.
And if you don't know, then you make it up.

1317
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,696
But please don't say
that you don't know.

1318
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:06,400
All right, I got...
- You better give me a kiss right now.

1319
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:10,206
Mmm.
- I love you, Ma.

1320
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,082
You feel like
you're gonna die too,

1321
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,144
but you live through it,

1322
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,588
and that's worse...

1323
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:24,853
you wish you'd die.

1324
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,660
Tito?

1325
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:32,165
Oh, Hector?

1326
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:36,059
He died with him.

1327
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:42,137
Your son is smiling
at you one minute,

1328
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:45,077
the next thing you know,
you turn around and he's gone.

1329
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,873
No one prepares you for that.
All the death in the worid

1330
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,537
couldn't prepare you
for that,

1331
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,945
and l've been around
a lot of death.

1332
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,973
But Hector... Hector...

1333
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,388
l'm gonna get going here.
If you need anything,

1334
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,185
just... just call me up,
okay?

1335
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,191
Thanks for everything, bro.
I appreciate it.

1336
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,887
Puchi, l... be back in the morning
just to check up on you.

1337
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,588
Hey, uh...
I l... I love you guys.

1338
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:46,465
Hey, Puchi.

1339
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:54,145
See you.

1340
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:02,779
That's it.
Everybody's gone.

1341
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:22,839
You know what
l've been thinking?

1342
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:31,248
We don't talk anymore.

1343
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:42,192
You know we haven't been straight
for more than three hours a day

1344
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:44,391
for, what, 20 years?

1345
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:48,024
Not since we met.

1346
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:53,470
And we just go on
with life like this.

1347
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,375
I love you, you know,

1348
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,385
but...

1349
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:07,853
it's impossible, Puchi.

1350
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:09,880
Impossible?

1351
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,320
Lmpossible?

1352
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:22,734
Oh, I get it.

1353
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:31,103
Now that
our son is dead,

1354
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:33,773
it all comes
clear to you?

1355
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:40,851
L'm this horrible bitch
and you're a great guy?

1356
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:43,721
And maybe
the best thing to do

1357
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:46,283
is just to...
to make it official now?

1358
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:51,192
Is that what you're
saying to me, Hector?

1359
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:55,430
All of a sudden a fucking light bulb
went off in your head...

1360
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:59,202
and now you're realizing

1361
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,834
that you and me
ain't good together?

1362
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:09,173
Is that what you're fucking saying
to me right now, Hector?

1363
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,320
So we're just gonna
break things up

1364
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:18,189
to fix it up?

1365
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:21,456
That's your fucking
genius idea?

1366
01:33:21,495 --> 01:33:24,430
Fix what up?

1367
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:32,262
Now?

1368
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:41,742
You f...

1369
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,182
fucking selfish bastard.

1370
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,790
You can never leave me.

1371
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,841
L've never been scared
of death, man, I mean...

1372
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:11,436
And Puchi?

1373
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:18,950
She tested fine.

1374
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:22,353
Still going out,
you know?

1375
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:26,759
I don't like talking about this shit,
you know?

1376
01:34:26,794 --> 01:34:29,558
Lt's like you can hear the clock ticking
in your head or something.

1377
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:33,499
You know...
dah dah dah. Fucking with you.

1378
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:35,502
Can't sleep.
Imagine,

1379
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:37,527
I can't sleep.

1380
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:42,776
I have all the time
in the worid to think about,

1381
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:45,210
'I should have quit...

1382
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,315
I should have done this,
I should have done that.'

1383
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:55,020
Can't do shit now.

1384
01:34:55,056 --> 01:34:57,581
Yes, you can.
Of course you can.

1385
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,061
Can't smile the same.

1386
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,068
Can't sing the same.

1387
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:10,627
Nothing's the same.
It's like...

1388
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:18,673
the fucking woman
I fell in love with, right...

1389
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:25,308
I put up with it.

1390
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:29,214
Now she can't put up with it,
you know?

1391
01:35:35,629 --> 01:35:38,598
Lt's almost like...
you're doing time or something.

1392
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:40,566
I don't know.
I don't understand it.

1393
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:45,328
You know what?

1394
01:35:45,372 --> 01:35:48,273
L'm gonna break you
out of jail.

1395
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:49,776
L'm here,

1396
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,779
and there are people still waiting
for you to sing again,

1397
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:55,111
to see you.

1398
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:58,016
They feel for you, man,
they mourn with you,

1399
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:01,510
but they need you.

1400
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:04,581
These people... these people
love you, Hector.

1401
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:06,957
They love you like, shh...

1402
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:09,485
No matter what.

1403
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:13,591
But they're not gonna wait forever.
You know how it is.

1404
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:16,660
Listen, take that gig
in Puerto Rico.

1405
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:19,138
It's home.
Take it.

1406
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:22,074
Merengue and all this other stuff
that's coming out now

1407
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:25,306
is gonna kill you, me,
Fania and everything.

1408
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:28,406
Let the people know
we're still here

1409
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:30,974
before they bury
all of us.

1410
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,322
How does anybody ever
leave this place, man?

1411
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:48,025
We're back now, man.
Feels good, huh?

1412
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:49,933
Yeah.

1413
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,438
Maybe... maybe this is
a new beginning, Papa.

1414
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,771
I hope so, man.

1415
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:58,973
L... I feel good, man.

1416
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:01,311
I feel good.

1417
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,475
Patience, people patience.

1418
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:06,281
In a couple minutes
were going to start

1419
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,220
this great Salsa concert.
But please...

1420
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:10,917
Now somebody explain
something to me, bro.

1421
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,949
I just... I hear cancellation
'cause he canceled it.

1422
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:14,517
No, listen, Hector...
- Wait.

1423
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:16,462
Somebody talk to me,
tell me the fucking truth, bro.

1424
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:18,522
L'm really sorry about
this whole situation, bro.

1425
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:20,431
I don't wanna cancel,
but Ralphie...

1426
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,025
Ralph, see?
The place is empty.

1427
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:24,162
You know, people didn't
show up, man.

1428
01:37:24,205 --> 01:37:26,173
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

1429
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:27,834
You know, I did my part.

1430
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,275
Whatever happened here, bro,
wasn't my fault. That's all I know.

1431
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:32,142
It's not your fault?
- It's not my fault.

1432
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:34,272
You didn't fucking advertise, okay?
And don't fucking talk to my artist.

1433
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:36,374
Hey, w-wait-w-w...
Take it easy, okay?

1434
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:38,715
Yeah, it's like you didn't know about
the free concert that's going on today,

1435
01:37:38,752 --> 01:37:40,219
right, in San Juan?
- The free concert?

1436
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:42,848
You didn't know about that either?
Five free bands.

1437
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:45,120
You knew about that concert,
so this is what you get.

1438
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:47,650
This is your concert now.
You take care of it now, all right?

1439
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:51,731
You're not in New York now, buddy.

1440
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:54,290
Bro, you're not in New York, okay?
This is Puerto Rico, buddy.

1441
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:56,701
Easy easy.
- You gotta fix what you broke, brother, okay?

1442
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:58,705
Come on, come on.
Easy easy, okay?

1443
01:37:58,739 --> 01:38:00,468
L'm gonna fucking sing now.
Take it easy, okay?

1444
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:02,566
First of all, l'm fucking here, okay?
L'm not a ghost.

1445
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,339
I came to sing,
I came to sing, bro.

1446
01:38:04,378 --> 01:38:06,039
Tell... Eddie, tell the band
not to fucking leave, okay?

1447
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,445
Hey, you guys don't go anywhere.
- The band is here.

1448
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:09,073
L'm here.
L'm the only one here.

1449
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:11,346
This one's on me.
You guys fix all your fucking problems,

1450
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,148
but l'm gonna sing, bro.
L'm a professional.

1451
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,178
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go, let's go, man.

1452
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:35,873
# Soon #

1453
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,310
# My lucky day will come #

1454
01:38:38,345 --> 01:38:40,313
# I hope that before I die #

1455
01:38:40,347 --> 01:38:42,872
# My luck will change #

1456
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,997
# Soon #

1457
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,803
# My lucky day will come #

1458
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:09,832
# I hope that before I die #

1459
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:12,505
# My luck will change #

1460
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:15,443
# Soon #

1461
01:39:15,482 --> 01:39:18,076
# My lucky day will come #

1462
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:20,143
# I hope that before I die #

1463
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:22,417
# My luck will change #

1464
01:39:59,893 --> 01:40:01,258
Yo!

1465
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:04,025
Hey, pull the sound back up!
Pull the sound back.

1466
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:05,656
Pull the fucking sound back up!
- Hello?

1467
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,730
'Hector I LOVE YOU SO MUCH'
Hey!

1468
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,103
Go on, go on, go on,
damn it, go on!

1469
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:57,579
# Soon #

1470
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:59,609
# My lucky day will come #

1471
01:40:59,653 --> 01:41:01,883
# I hope that before I die #

1472
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:04,015
# My luck will change #

1473
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:07,391
# Soon #

1474
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:09,453
# My lucky day will come #

1475
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:11,589
# I hope that before I die #

1476
01:41:11,632 --> 01:41:13,793
# My luck will change #

1477
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:16,064
# Many times l've stopped
to think #

1478
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:18,936
# That l've never done
anybody any harm #

1479
01:41:18,972 --> 01:41:21,099
# Why has life treated
me this way #

1480
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:23,701
# When l'm just looking
for happiness? #

1481
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:26,042
# I try to make people happy #

1482
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,674
# But what l've said here
has been fatal #

1483
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:31,013
# I don't lose hope that l'll fight #

1484
01:41:31,051 --> 01:41:34,680
# And surely my luck with change,
but when will that be? #

1485
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,894
Hurry up!

1486
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:45,088
Help him, please.

1487
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:23,968
I mean, how do you
live through that, right?

1488
01:42:24,004 --> 01:42:26,564
What did they expect
from him?

1489
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:30,238
What, that he was
fucking Superman?

1490
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:32,575
King Kong couldn't
live through that.

1491
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:38,451
I mean, l... sometimes I wonder
what l'm doing

1492
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:40,851
sitting here in one piece.

1493
01:42:40,888 --> 01:42:44,449
Everybody in the story
is fucking dead.

1494
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:48,018
He had multiple fractures
and broken bones

1495
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:50,029
and he hurt
all his insides

1496
01:42:50,063 --> 01:42:53,032
which were already all fucked up
from all the drugs and the alcohol,

1497
01:42:53,066 --> 01:42:55,432
and he survived.

1498
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:57,835
You know what?
The motherfucker survived the fall.

1499
01:42:57,871 --> 01:43:00,601
He hit an air conditioning shaft
on the way down

1500
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:02,905
outside
Johnny Pacheco's room

1501
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:05,070
and he bounced, that's all.
But if he would have

1502
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:07,376
hit the concrete,
he would have been dead, forget it.

1503
01:43:07,414 --> 01:43:09,848
But he didn't.

1504
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:12,249
He did... he lived.

1505
01:43:12,286 --> 01:43:16,086
He lived
five more years.

1506
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:18,683
But it wasn't real life.

1507
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,755
And I wasn't there for him
all the time, you know?

1508
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:27,130
Never never
leave me, baby.

1509
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:31,900
It's not the same thing
as being there with you.

1510
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:35,932
Touching you,
kissing you.

1511
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:39,036
You know, well.

1512
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:42,879
L'd better stop.

1513
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:46,852
Just wanted to tell you
over and over that I love you.

1514
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:49,481
L'm right here with you.

1515
01:43:49,523 --> 01:43:51,855
You see me.

1516
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:57,261
Happy birthday, Puchi. Happy bi...

1517
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:03,566
I wanted to remember him
like he was.

1518
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:10,736
Like he wanted me to.

1519
01:44:40,007 --> 01:44:43,340

You're crying #
