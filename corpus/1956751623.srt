Tell them. Pay.

197
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,208
If not?

198
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,166
I take this...

199
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,708

- Sanjib.
- Who's Sanjib?

249
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,500
You just threw him off the roof.

00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,708
[chuckles]

251
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,166
Come here.

252
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:06,291
What's your name?

253
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:07,500
Farhad.

254
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:08,916
Farhad?

255
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,333
You're pretty clever.

256
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,083
Pay attention...

257
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,333
and learn...

258
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,666
that's how you survive.

259
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,750
You need to be smart. Use your wits.

260
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,708
Eh, Farhad?

261
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,041
Cut off two of your fingers.

262
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,583
Any two.

263
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:45,916
Why?

264
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,666
Because the kid who stole from me is dead.

265
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,875
And I'd like a walking reminder

266
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,500
of what happens when you touch my money.

267
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,458
I'd recommend the left hand.

268
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,500
So you can still hold a gun.

269
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,000
[colonel] Amir!

270
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,416

Close the city.

Bridges, trains, airports...

276
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,166
Close everything.

277
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,833
Impossible, Amir.

278
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,750
Make it possible, Colonel,

279
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,250
or you'll lose more than just a finger.

280
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,125
Hmm?

281
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:20,083

But something is fucked here.

Saju could have a deal with the men
who grabbed you and send you back to them.

386

That's not the job.

The only chance
of getting my money is you, mate. So...

524
00:51:03,916 --> 00:51:04,916
no.

525
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,125

It helps.

532
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,666
My father hates it when I do it.

533
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,083
He thinks of me the same way you do.

534
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,041
More like a thing than a person.

535
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,625
I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

536
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,875
It's okay.

538
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:43,875
Sir.

539
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,083
[in Bengali] How many beds?

540
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,416

543
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,125
Saju?

544
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,583
[Saju in English] <i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

545
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,750
[Neysa in Hindi] Are you okay?

546
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,000
[Saju in Hindi] <i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

547
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:46,416
If you don't hear from me
in the next 12 hours...

548
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,875
take the cash and go.

549
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,916
Disappear.

550
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,666
You understand me, right?

551
00:53:57,666 --> 00:53:58,833
[Neysa] <i>I understand.</i>

552
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:01,291
<i>Are you okay?</i>

553
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:03,583
I'm fine.

554
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:06,958
Just tired.

555
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,208
[in English] I love you.

556
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:15,250
<i>I love you, too.</i>

557
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:19,000
<i>Put Aarav on the phone.</i>

558
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,041
[Neysa in Hindi] Aarav,
Papa's on the phone.

559
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:28,541
Sadia.

560
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:31,875
[in English] Hello, Papa.

561
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:33,791
Hey, champ.

562
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,083
[in Hindi] Are you coming home soon?

563
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:40,750
Yes, it'll be very soon.

564
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:41,750
<i>When?</i>

565
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:42,750
When?

566
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,125
When you wake up in the morning.

567
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,833
You help your mother, okay?

568
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,791
<i>Yes, Papa, I will.</i>

569
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,083
[in English] I love you.

00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:05,333
Always.

[Nik] <i>You got a chopper.</i>
<i>Meet you at the east side of the bridge.</i>

577
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,750
Copy. I'm on the move.

578
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,916
Kid. Kid. Hey, come on.

579
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,750
Hey.

580
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:56,875
Get in, go.

581
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,208
Come on, you bastard.

[bike engine revving]

583
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:23,458
Get out of the car.

584
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,583
Go, go, go, go, go!

585
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,916

- Yeah.

- [in Bengali] Hey, this guy wants my gun!
- [in Bengali] My ankle is broken!

587
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,333
[boy] Leave my gun.

588
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:02,666
Leave it!

589
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,708
My friend is gonna shoot you!

590
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,250
Hey! Give me my gun... Give it back!

591
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,333
That's my gun. Give it back to me!

592
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,250
- Give it back or I'll blow you away!
- [Farhad] I will finish you off.

593
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,166
The fuck?

I'll kill you!

601
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,541
I'll murder you.

You are surrounded.

605
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,583
Please surrender to DMP

- Call Gaspar.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

615
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:27,875
We just got attacked by the Goonies
from hell. We made it about four blocks.

616
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:29,458
I said get rid of the kid.

617
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:31,250
I don't give a shit what you said.

618
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,333
We're in the worst smelling sewer
on the planet.

619
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:36,458
There's about 200 cops over our heads.
Just call Gaspar.

620
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:40,166
<i>- Tyler, I don't think that's a good idea.</i>
- The guy owes me his life, Nik.

00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,000
<i>- Tyler, I...</i>
- Call him.

622

[breathing heavily and groaning]

623
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,500
Your name's Tyler?

624
00:59:56,666 --> 00:59:57,500
Mmm-hmm.

625
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,416
I'm Ovi.

626
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,166
Nice to meet ya.

[Hindi rap song playing over stereo]

[Gaspar] Ugh, Jesus Christ!

630
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:18,666
[Gaspar] Hey, how's it going?

631
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,916
Yeah, better after the shower.

632
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:28,583
[Tyler grunts]

633
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:34,916
Cheers.

634
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:43,125
Good to see you, man.

635
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,333
I appreciate you coming for us.

636
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,875
The hell is wrong with you?
Don't insult me.

637
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,375
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

638
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:54,541
Hey, how's that kid?

639
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,416
Uh, he's resting.

640
01:01:58,666 --> 01:01:59,833
So, where are we?

641
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,916
We are south of the city center.

642
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:08,875
I told Nik that an extraction is...
It's not feasible.

643
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,416
Well, you know, the city
is surrounded by rivers.

644
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,083
There are bridges going in and out.

645
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:18,416
But every one of those bridges currently
is blocked by a roadblock

646
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:21,833
because you are a very popular individual.

647
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:28,250
I figure we lie low a couple days,
we let the panic dissipate.

648
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:33,500
And we'll get you going.
Now, my wife made that.

649
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,583
So, I want you to be very careful
what you say.

650
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,416
Your wife?

651
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,625
[chuckles]

652
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:41,458
And what's that for, the knee?

653
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,333
Yeah, knee, back, shoulder...

654
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:49,208
Hang on one sec... my knee.
Ow! Oh, God. Oh, it hurts.

655
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,458
Two oughta do it.

656
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:56,875
[swallows and exhales]

657
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:59,625
Okay. I gotta go. I gotta go.

658
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:01,583
I gotta kiss my wife.

659
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:06,666
But you stay here and rest up.
And I will be back.

660
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,791
It's good to see you, man. I missed you.

661
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,333
[door closes]

662
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,375
[sighs]

663
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:36,958
[engine revving]

664
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
[hip-hop song playing]

665
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,416
[in Bengali] Don't you see I'm eating?

666
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,083
- [Farhad] I had him...
- [Asif] Had who?

667
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,833
The man you want.

668
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,416
I lost him...

669
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,625
near the market.

670
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,625
Tell them to scour the market.

671
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,916
[Shadek] Yes, sir.

672
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,291
- What is this?
- A gift.

673
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,500
When you catch him,

674
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,666
I want to be the one to pull the trigger.

675
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,541
If you let me do that,

676
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,666
I'll give you the other finger!

677
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,958
He made me feel like a fool.

678
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,708
Of course he did.

679
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,458
You're only a kid. Hmm?

680
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:41,333
Here's some advice, a gift.

681
01:05:43,333 --> 01:05:46,583
Keep your other finger.

682
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:51,125
Because no matter how badass
you think you are...

683
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,458
there's always a badass
who's bigger than you.

684
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:14,916
[Tyler exhales heavily]

685
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,125
[Ovi] Tyler.

686
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,250
Yeah?

687
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:28,791
If you had been killed today,
it would have been my fault.

688
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,750
No, mate. But it would've been my fault.

689
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,208
You don't look like a Tyler.

690
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,541
[chuckles softly]

691
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,208
No?

692
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:43,333
What do I look like?

693
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:47,250
A Brad.

694
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:49,166
[chuckles]

695
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:52,750
Yeah.

696
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,000
Can I ask you something?

697
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,500
It's Rake.

698
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,208
- What's Rake?
- My last name.

699
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,916
That's not what I was going to ask.

700
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,875
That's a strange last name, though.

701
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:12,125
Isn't that like a gardening tool?

702
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,500
What were you gonna ask me?

703
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:25,666
If you were always this way.
You know... brave.

704
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:27,666
I'm not brave, mate.

705
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,291
Of course you are. You rescue people.

706
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,666
Yeah, sometimes.
Sometimes I do other things.

707
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:42,875
Like killing people?

708
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,666
Yeah.

709
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:51,166
My father, he kills people, too.

710
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,791
Sometimes, I would sit with him at dinner,
look at him and think,

711
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:02,750
he just killed somebody else's father
that day.

712
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,791
And I'd feel sick.

713
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:26,458
You have a family?

714
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,250
I did have me a wife.

715
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,208
Where is she?

716
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:37,791
I don't know.
I haven't seen her in a long time.

717
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,083
Children?

718
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:44,625
Yeah, a son.

719
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,208
Where is he?

720
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,208
He died a few years ago.

721
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,625
How did he die?

722
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,041
Lymphoma.

723
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,041
How old was he?

724
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,541
Six.

725
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:23,291
[breath trembling]

726
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,375
[scoffs]

727
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:30,875
I wasn't even there... when he died.

728
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,750
Where were you?

729
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,125
Kandahar, Afghanistan.
It was my third tour.

730
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,375
You were called away?

731
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,166
No.

732
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,000
I left.

733
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:02,958
Voluntary.

734
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,250
Because you couldn't watch?

735
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:15,958
Yep.

736
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,625
I told you, mate. I'm not brave.
I'm just...

737
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,916
I'm just the opposite.

738
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,208
You know...

739
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:41,333
"You drown not by falling into the river,

740
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,875
but by staying submerged in it."

741
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:50,916
Who told you that?

742
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:53,750
I read it in a book in school.

743
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:19,500
[vehicle approaching]

744
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:35,875
[in Spanish] <i>Estancia Los Chanares.</i>

745
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,208
- [in English] Yes. Yes!
- [chuckles] I don't know...

746
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,916
It's the best dove hunting in Argentina.

747
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:44,208
Just lie in this pool...
You lie in a pool and they fly around!

748
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,750
[mimics wings flapping]

749
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,458
And you shoot them. [mimics gun firing]

750
01:11:48,541 --> 01:11:50,166
And you sip a Cuba Libre.

751
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,458
I shot my first dove when I was
ten years old. Have I told you this?

752
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,416
- I haven't. Listen.
- I think you have.

753
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,083
No. It was when I was ten years old,
my dad... My dad... The gun backfired,

754
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:05,000
gave me a black eye,
and my dad laughs at me.

755
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:09,083
I used to move so quick,
kill those little shits.

756
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,291
Not anymore, though.

757
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,916
It sucks getting old, man. Sucks!

758
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,833
- [loudly] Getting old sucks.
- Shh.

759
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,208
[softly] Sucks!

760
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,250
I think he's asleep.

761
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,541
What a goddamn tragedy, hmm?

762
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,666
That kid is a walking corpse.

763
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:42,083
Asif will never let him live.

764
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,291
Think the disgrace.

765
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,708
I mean, you get him home. And then, what?
His father's in prison.

766
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:53,541
There's no way to protect him.

767
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,125
You know what the best thing
you could do?

768
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,125
The best thing you could do, honestly,
would be to go up there right now

769
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,916
and just go put a bullet in his brain.
Make it painless.

770
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,583
'Cause the animals out there,
they're not gonna be... as kind to him.

771
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:16,541
They like to start with the ears.

772
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:20,666
Then they cut off
each finger at the joint.

773
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,833
Mate, you're drunk.

774
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,416
I'm talking about mercy, Tyler.

775
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,791
You know how much he's worth?

776
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,541
We're talking about a kid, Gaspar.

777
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,500
We're talking about a gangster's kid.

778
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,541
With a price tag
of ten million on his head.

779
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,166
You need to sober up, mate.

780
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,875
You're a mercenary, right, Tyler?
Why don't you act the mercenary?

781
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:57,458
Aren't you sick of this life?
'Cause I am and I...

782
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:03,666
I do not wanna end it playing hero
on some goddamn suicide mission...

783
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,541
What are you doing?
You said you'd help me.

784
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:08,708
I am helping you. Ten million dollars.

785
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:12,333
I'll get you to the border
in a couple hours.

786
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:16,708
It's money in your pocket.
I take care of the body. Painless.

787
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,583
And it's the best that
that kid can hope for.

788
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:21,958
Did you call someone?

789
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,916
- [groans]
- Who'd you call?

790
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,583
Why are you such a hypocrite? You've got
the blood of a hundred men on your hands...

791
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:28,500
[grunts] Answer me!

792
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,375
[panting] Put your hands on me?

793
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,416
What'd you do?

794
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,000
Do you know what happens to me
if they find out that I'm helping you?

795
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:39,083
You know what happens to my wife?

796
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:41,583
Asif's a friend.

797
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:45,291
I did some work for him.
We made a deal.

798
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,958
He gets the kid, you get your freedom,
and we both get rich.

799
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,500
What do you want from me?
Walk upstairs and shoot the kid

800
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,625
in the fucking head?

801
01:14:53,708 --> 01:14:57,375
No. No. I'll do it.

802
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,250
Don't do this.

803
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,666
You saved my life once.

804
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,666
Now I'm gonna save yours.

805
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,375
Step aside.

806
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,541
[both grunting]

807
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:40,500
Come on, Tyler. Stop!

808
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,708
[choking]

809
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,000
[panting]

810
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,333
What are we doing, man? Huh?

811
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:05,500
Come on, stay down.

812
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,958
Stay down.

813
01:16:08,083 --> 01:16:09,166
[Tyler grunts]

814
01:16:19,666 --> 01:16:20,500
[yells]

815
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:24,750
[panting]

816
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,083
Hey, kid.

817
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,875
I know it looks bad. I know it looks bad.

818
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,250
[gasping]

819
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,375
[breathing raggedly]

820
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:09,916
[gasping]

821
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,916
[breathing stops]

822
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,041
[shuddering]

823
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,416
[shakily] I want to go home.

824
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,958
I'll get you home, mate.

825
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,250
I'll get you home.

826
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,416
[cell phone vibrating]

827
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,458
[Tyler]<i> I've got the boy.</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

828
01:18:57,208 --> 01:18:59,583
[prayer chant playing over speakers]

829
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:22,791
Stay here.

830
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:58,458
Just like that?

831
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:00,708
Yeah, just like that.

832
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,708
I want the boy out of here.
That's all I care about.

833
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:06,041
Why?

834
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,250
'Cause I do.

835
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,875
He was gonna kill my family
if I didn't get his son back.

836
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:28,458
My people are waiting for him
on the other side

837
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:29,958
of the Sultana Kamal bridge.

838
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:32,875
There's two blockades
between here and there.

839
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,833
I'll do my best
to draw them away from both.

840
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,750
You get him to the other side.

841
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:56,375
Tyler.

842
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,333
See you soon, mate.

843
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:08,458
[Saju in Hindi] Let's go.

844
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:10,625
[in English] Come on.

845
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:14,041
- [indistinct chatter]
- [horns honking]

846
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:51,875
Do you trust him?

847
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:54,458
I do.

848
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,083

[indistinct clamoring]

853
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:18,250
[in Hindi] We'll have to go on foot.

854
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,500
[in Bengali] Any sign of the boy?

855
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:48,208
[colonel] Not yet.

856
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,625
But we've seen our friend...

857
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,583
the kid must be near.

858
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,541
[officer 1 yelling in Bengali]

859
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,083

[indistinct clamoring]

861
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,541
[man in Hindi] We need to go to India.

862
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:36,708
You can't go.
I'm telling you, you can't go.

863
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,416
[arguing continues indistinctly]

864
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:48,500
[in Bengali] Hey! You there!

865
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:56,291
Hey! Hey, stop!
Don't cross the bridge.

866
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,916
Hey! I'm telling you to stop!

867
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,625
Hey, stop!

868
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:08,500
- Take his hat off. Let me see his face.
- Huh?

869
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:09,458
[in Hindi] I don't understand.

870
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,583
[in Bengali] His hat. Take it off.

871
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,916
[in Hindi] Do what he says.

872
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,458
Take off your cap.

to the bridge.

879

Two units to the bridge. Hurry!

880
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:34,791
Bring me my rifle!
