2
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,280
Ok.

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,914
I just found a new friend.

4
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,279
Target 2 o'clock.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,473
Range, 1709 meters.

6
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,952
Wind, 3 o'clock, 6 miles per hour.
Wind right quadrant, 2.3 millimeters.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,680
Mike...

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,317
I know you're good.
I mean you're very good, okay?

9
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,154
But you're not that good.

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,713
We're not here to play.

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,559
Then why are we here?

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,190
I know what you're thinking.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,715
"We're here to complete the mission."
Come on, man.

14
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,750
What's the point, Tommy?

15
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,912
Okay, the point is that...

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,113
We've been here...what?

17
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,536
Two months?

18
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,433
Three months and six days.

19
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
Friend, and that's the point.

20
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,233
And exactly that point.

21
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,956
Three months and six days...

22
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,794
you're far from Jenny.

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,590
Oh Jenny...

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,796
Jenny, I love you.

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,479
Jenny, I want to kiss you.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,473
Oh Jenny... Jenny, kiss me.

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,914
Contact!
Who?

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,136
Shit.

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,656
They're here.

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,756
Oxen, Oxen! Alpha Margo 4.

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,680
Elvis is in the building.

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,520
Where, Oxen?

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,315
The target should arrive in a
black Land Cruiser with an escort.

34
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,471
Confirm target before next step.

35
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,879
You said black, it's gray...

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,016
...and another vehicle.

37
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
It's always a Land Cruiser, Mike.

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,816
Something's going on.

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,196
It seems to be for...

40
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,040
...celebrating some sort of ceremony.

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,950
Land Cruiser approaching.

42
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,552
Target is Sayid Assiff, 65 years old.

43
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,076
Confirm, over.

44
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,278
Target, 10 o'clock.

45
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,279
Range 977 meters.

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,616
Range 977.

47
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,316
Index.

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,597
Maybe he grew a beard
since he was last photographed.

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,576
I think it's him.

50
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,296
Target confirmed.

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,976
Shoot.

52
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,016
It's a wedding.

53
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,830
So?

54
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,079
Repeat, over.

55
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,096
So?

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,435
Target confirmed, over.

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,616
Send it.

58
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,136
Send it.

59
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,676
Alpha Margo 4...

60
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,998
Confirm kill, over.

61
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,476
I don't have a clean shot.

62
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,256
Oxen...

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,279
The groom is blocking the target.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,109
We're waiting for instructions, sir.
Over.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,390
Mike, don't get any ideas, ok?
This is what we're here for.

66
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,031
Neutralize the target, over.

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,478
Mike, don't freak out,
just shoot the guy!

68
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,591
Alpha Margo 4 to Oxen,
it's a wedding.

69
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,839
You're asking me to kill the
groom and his father.

70
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,195
Confirm, over.

71
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,469
Alpha Margo 4, it took us 13 months
to locate Sayid Assiff.

72
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,150
As far as we know, Assiff has no children...

73
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,436
but that guy could be part
of the same terrorist cell.

74
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,079
No need for a clean shot,

75
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,391
Neutralize and confirm. Over.

76
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,597
See, Mike? Terrorists get married too.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,480
We're not even sure that's Assiff.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,710
He came from a different vehicle...

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,678
and you know that from here we
can't confirm his identity!

80
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,916
Shoot, Mike.

81
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,519
Shoot the damn shot, Mike.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,075
Confirm, over.

83
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Fuck it, Mike!
Shoot!

84
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,753
Oxen, the target moved.
I lost him.

85
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,118
Alpha Margo 4 off.
Damn it, Mike!

86
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,076
Alpha Margo 4.

87
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,710
Mission canceled.

88
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,598
We need extraction.
Come and get us, over.

89
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,070
Give us your new position, over

90
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Negative.

91
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,116
GPS is out of order, over.

92
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,880
Copy that, wait for orders,
we'll find a new position...

93
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,536
What are you doing?

94
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,856
Something.

95
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,620
Hey, check over there!

96
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,420
Sandstorm! Sandstorm!
Sandstorm! Sandstorm! Sandstorm!

97
00:09:49,484 --> 00:09:50,620
Let's go! Let's go!

98
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,796
Mayday, Mayday! Alpha Margo 4!
We require immediate extraction!

99
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,191
Sandstorm approaching, over!

100
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,313
The new position for the extraction
is a village six clicks to the west.

101
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,629
Do you copy? Over.

102
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,594
Negative, I didn't get that!

103
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,953
A village six clicks west of here? Over.

104
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,754
Great, Mike!

105
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,514
5 hours on foot!

106
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,919
The West and the...
I know which way is West!

107
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,194
Do you know what day it is?

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,976
Its Tuesday.

109
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,470
Not any Tuesday, Mike.

110
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,789
It's the second Tuesday of the month,

111
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,553
so my son's waiting for my call.

112
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,200
I know.

113
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,754
I've never missed one.

114
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,360
What do you usually talk about?

115
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,515
How old is he now, four?

116
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,915
Actually, he's decided...

117
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,159
to become a vegetarian.

118
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,269
The other day,
Anne was at home, cleaning...

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,232
She looked in the garden and there
was Jake, who walked around muttering.

120
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,376
So she says: "Jake!"

121
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,480
"Jake, what are you doing?"

122
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,636
So, he turns around with a leaf in his
mouth and says: "My name is not Jake!"

123
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,310
"I'm a brontosaurus!"

124
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,840
My friend...and crazy!

125
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,159
I know, maybe it's all bullshit...

126
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,274
but they make me feel better.

127
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,430
Unbelievable, right?

128
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,757
I thought this marriage thing
was a big mistake. A curse.

129
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,034
But then along came Jake...

130
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,600
and it changed everything.
I mean, I always fought...

131
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,273
and we still fight all the time...

132
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,080
but now we have this little man that
makes us careful about what we say.

133
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,073
We used to lose control.
We said stupid things.

134
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,550
We didn't talk for days.

135
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,676
But then, Jake...

136
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,596
He starightened us out.

137
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,834
I know that look.

138
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,634
What's on your mind, Mike?
Eh?

139
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,120
Is there something you need to tell me?

140
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,476
Say it you can't hold it inside.
Whatever it is, you have to let it out.

141
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,912
It's much better if you air it.

142
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,077
You want to ask
Jenny to marry you, right?

143
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
The thing is...
It's complicated.

144
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,120
It's a big step.

145
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,754
Already it's complicated?

146
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,056
It's a...

147
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,016
small step...

148
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,120
for humanity...

149
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,673
but a big step...

150
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,136
for a man.

151
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,398
Oh, Mike, you really
are a mess, you know?

152
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,956
What's wrong?

153
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,960
This is Oxen...

154
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
we don't see any guerillas
in your area, Alpha Margo,

155
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,192
but if you stick your heads up,
they'll come looking for you,

156
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,637
The new position for the extraction
is away from their shelters...

157
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,776
and sandstorms,

158
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,717
We can't use helicopters and the mission
doesn't include ground transportation.

159
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,720
II you have to cross the desert...

160
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,833
the dunes will
keep changing shape...

161
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,513
so the radio won't always work.

162
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,376
Hold on, Marines!

163
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,279
I don't see anything
with all this sand.

164
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,834
I think I see something moving.

165
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,130
Maybe the natives.

166
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,536
What are they doing?

167
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,450
It looks like...

168
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,296
they're...

169
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,576
digging...

170
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,950
in the sand.

171
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,029
If those were the Berbers...

172
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,239
it means that we're
heading in the right direction...

173
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,633
unless it was just a mirage.

174
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,960
I know that it's very effective
but it's just a trick of the Berbers.

175
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,351
They use these signs to keep the
enemies away from the village.

176
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,320
I just want to say that
we must be close, man.

177
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,952
The village is probably
right behind that dune.

178
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,896
Over there.

179
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,016
Come on, let's go.

180
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,394
Over the last 40 years,
there's been over 8,000 battles...

181
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,511
and we've buried 33 million
mines in this area.

182
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,616
Mines?

183
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,190
I like when you're optimistic, Mike.

184
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,080
Ok!
Listen, Mr. Wikipedia...

185
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,117
You can find everything in the desert.

186
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,399
As old as this sign looks...

187
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,154
who knows where it comes from
and what it really says?

188
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,959
Mike, don't get paranoid.

189
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,191
Don't let this thing
screw up your head.

190
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,029
I'm just considering our options.

191
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,713
We have two options,

192
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,157
because we're really lucky guys.

193
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,880
We can back off and die of thirst,

194
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,078
or we can get to the village
within an hour, Mike.

195
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,719
I know which option to choose.

196
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,016
You know what?

197
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,530
I don't really like water.

198
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,110
It's overrated.

199
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,496
It has no taste.

200
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,456
A beautiful...

201
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,056
icy...

202
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,736
Granita...

203
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,834
is what I want.

204
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,791
Usually, I drink it with lemon...

205
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,390
but this time...

206
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,914
I'll take the strawberry.

207
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,136
Thanks, Mike.

208
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:52,737
Whoa! Oh, ok.

209
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:56,878
Mmm! Ok, Mike!

210
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,136
You know what?

211
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,959
Forget what I said about water.

212
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,832
A couple of drops gets
you going again!

213
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,096
Come on, Mike.

214
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,696
Come on, Mike!

215
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,216
Come on, Mike!

216
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,399
You have to stop thinking about
that sign, you're losing it!

217
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,120
I'm not surprised...

218
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,198
since you're you.

219
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,757
You do have to explain one thing.

220
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,416
How is it possible

221
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,912
that a psychopath like you...

222
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,797
You're not afraid to get into
fights with...how many were there?

223
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,336
I think they...

224
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,992
Four? No, five...

225
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,076
of the biggest Army
Rangers I've ever seen...

226
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,031
and then shit your pants for a sign flying
in the desert from who knows where?

227
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,749
I just had a premonition.

228
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,793
I feel that there is a
Granita stand in that village.

229
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,799
Who knows, maybe...

230
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,597
Tommy?! Listen to me,
you have to calm down, okay?!

231
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,635
You have to calm down, fuck!

232
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,679
Mayday Mayday, this is Alpha-Marg...

233
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,112
Mike, it hurts!

234
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,359
Tommy, listen to me!
I can't move, okay?

235
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,672
I stepped on one too!
Oh, my God, Mike!

236
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,880
Tommy, you have to calm down now, okay?

237
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,640
We have to get to the village!

238
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,917
If you stay like this,
we'll never make it!

239
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,840
Yes, ok, the village...

240
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,509
Okay, I'll get there!

241
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,480
You have to grab the radio!

242
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,560
Yeah!

243
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,479
Come on, you can do it!
Ok, I can do it.

244
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,394
Mike, I can do it.

245
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,115
Ok, I see my backpack.

246
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,830
Grab it, Marine. Reach!

247
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,616
Come on, Tommy!

248
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,671
No Mike, it hurts!
You have to grab the radio, man!

249
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,400
I can't move, I can't!
Yes you can! Reach!

250
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,391
Grab your medical kit!
The middle pocket!

251
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,119
The thing is... Come on, man!
Get the kit! Ok, ok!

252
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,992
Come on, Marine, get it!
Ok, ok.

253
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,116
So?

254
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,549
Grab your medical kit!

255
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,036
Well done, Marine!

256
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,594
You did it. Well done.

257
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,896
Well done.

258
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,679
I got it.
So do you.

259
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,116
No, no!
Tommy, you have to...

260
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,559
Come on, man, you need that morphine!
Reach, Marine, reach...

261
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Concentrate!

262
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,160
Concentrate, ignore the pain!

263
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,558
Think training!
We have to get to the village!

264
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,336
And then...

265
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,354
you have to call Jake!
Repeat that!

266
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,595
Jake...
Exactly.

267
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,360
Jake is waiting for me...
And Tuesday!

268
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,993
That's right Marine. Now move!

269
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,832
No, don't look, Tommy.
Mike, I have no legs!

270
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,354
No, Tommy, don't look!
I have no legs!

271
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,794
Come on man, don't look!

272
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,515
Don't look!
Mike I'm no longer your legs!

273
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,194
Mike, I'm no longer your legs!

274
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,109
Be strong, it's next to you!

275
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,296
That's right.

276
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,576
Well done!

277
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,080
Now you can reach your backpack?

278
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,276
We need the radio.

279
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,953
No, wait, one dose is
more than enough.

280
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,256
No, Tommy!

281
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,553
No, one is enough!

282
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:16,836
Ok, ok, alright.

283
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,033
I need to listen to me.

284
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,158
You have to reach the backpack.

285
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,711
You have to get the radio, ok?
Ok.

286
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,696
Can you?

287
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,096
Bravo, grab the bag!

288
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,154
There, I got it!

289
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,073
Well done!
I got it!

290
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,376
Bravo!

291
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,556
I got it.
You did it!

292
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,100
Well done, mate.

293
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,256
Everything will be fine!

294
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,796
Alpha Margo 4...

295
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,277
Man down. I can't hear you.
I can't hear you in my com

296
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,198
You have to turn the radio on!
I need a phone...

297
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,220
to call Jake.

298
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,880
I need a phone to call... my son...

299
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,278
Tommy, can't hear you in my com.

300
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,194
Check that the walkie is on!
A lemon Granita...

301
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,496
All right.

302
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,560
Stay with me.
I don't want strawberry...

303
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,435
Mike, you know what I want?
Stay with me, Tommy!

304
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,200
The village...

305
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,790
Yes, I have to get to the village.
Beautiful Sara, Mike...

306
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,954
You'll see, it'll be beautiful.

307
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,516
It'll be ok, man.
Now I get it.

308
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,513
Maybe this old mine is rusty and
doesn't work anymore. Now I get it.

309
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,593
Don't even think about it, Mike!

310
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,478
I have to do something!
Do not even think about it, Mike!

311
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,233
You're losing too much blood!

312
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,352
I won't let you die!

313
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,711
Mike, can you tell Jake
that I love him so much?

314
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,154
Stay alive, my friend.
No!

315
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,136
Shit.

316
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,656
The battery.

317
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,751
Mayday, Mayday, Alpha Margo 4
to Oxen. Do you copy, over?

318
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,276
Alpha Margo 4 to Oxen. Do you copy?

319
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,936
Over.

320
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,136
Base camp here,

321
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,632
We've been trying for hours,
Alpha Margo. Over.

322
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,114
I copy, Oxen.

323
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,353
Sir, my partner was killed
on this mission.

324
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,912
and I'm in critical condition,
I request immediate extraction with EOD.

325
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,256
Over.

326
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,792
Define critical, Sergeant. Over.

327
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,438
I stepped on an explosive device, sir.

328
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,314
The same kind that
killed my spotter, over.

329
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,514
Major! Over.

330
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,916
What about the mission, Sergeant? Over.

331
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,976
Failed, sir.

332
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,194
But I need help.

333
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,152
Sir, I need immediate help. Over.

334
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,676
What's your position, Alpha Margo?
Over.

335
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,875
I can't say for sure.

336
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,470
The GPS is out of order.

337
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,376
We're about...

338
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,951
4 hours east
of the point of release.

339
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,056
Copy.

340
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,075
You're still an hour
from the village. Over.

341
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,913
I don't know if you understood
what my current situation is...

342
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,517
I'm stuck with my left
foot on a goddam mine. Over.

343
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,109
Copy, Alpha Margo, I understand
your situation clearly, over.

344
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,317
Great, you get my situation clearly!
So come and get me! Over.

345
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,480
Negative.

346
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,354
Our choppers can't fly
because of the continuous sandstorms.

347
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,496
Over.

348
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,436
Shit.

349
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,513
So what's the plan? Over.

350
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,790
There's a convoy under fire
near the border

351
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,918
If all goes well, it will be in your
area in about 52 hours, Sergeant.

352
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,056
Over.

353
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,336
Sir...

354
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,560
with all due respect...

355
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,277
If all goes well, I don't know
if I can survive for 52 hours.

356
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,816
Over.

357
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,395
Be prepared to report your position
when the time will comes.

358
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,837
We will contact you by radio...

359
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,349
to make sure that you're...

360
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,836
still there,

361
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,416
Over.

362
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,016
That's it?

363
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,717
What happened to
"No one left behind"?

364
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,376
Over.

365
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,320
Listen to me, Sergeant Stevens,

366
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,675
The type of mines scattered in that area
can remain active for about 40 years...

367
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,510
but ten years after production,
so they say...

368
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,910
about 4% will malfunction.

369
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,678
After 15 years in,
this can be as high as 7%.

370
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,496
Great.

371
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,356
Considering the situation,
my personal advice...

372
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,030
if you can't survive
until we come...

373
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,833
try the the Schumann Maneuver.

374
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,675
The Schumann Maneuver, Major? Over.

375
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,920
It's a last resort.

376
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,914
Dig a small trench to shelter
you from the explosion...

377
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,677
then fasten the sole of
your boot to the ground.

378
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,850
Major?

379
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,460
Major?

380
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,600
Over.

381
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:07,753
You can avoid harm to your major organs
from the shock wave of the blast...

382
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,876
Fuck the Schumann Maneuver!

383
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,576
Perfect.

384
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,136
That's it, huh?

385
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,536
Pardon me, Tom.

386
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,874
I have to change the batteries.

387
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,536
Thanks, my friend.

388
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,616
No water.

389
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,896
No radio.

390
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,358
This is your last stop, Mike.

391
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,918
Help!

392
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,736
Help!

393
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,216
Come on, Mike.

394
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,100
Stop!

395
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,839
Show me your hands,
don't take another step!

396
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,196
Do you understand me?

397
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,150
Don't move!

398
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,034
It's a minefield!

399
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,956
Full of mines here!
Boom!

400
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,370
You find it funny?

401
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,920
Did you put the mines here?

402
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,520
That's why it's so amusing?

403
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,380
Listen, man.

404
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,040
Please.
I can't stay stuck here forever.

405
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,830
Why are you stuck?

406
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,195
Thank God, he understands...

407
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,471
Well, listen, I need
water and a radio.

408
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,559
Is your village over that dune?

409
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,136
Water!

410
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,216
Radio!

411
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,230
Why did you stop here?

412
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Not going home...

413
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,936
to your family?

414
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,696
Are you kidding?

415
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,509
My left foot...

416
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,479
is on a mine!

417
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,156
If I move...

418
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,176
Do you get it?

419
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,700
Why is that?

420
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,029
Yes, this is why!

421
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,816
Are you sure?

422
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,756
You see this body?

423
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,830
This is Thomas Madison, my best friend.

424
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,636
And he died because he stepped
on one of your mines!

425
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,630
The mines aren't mine.

426
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,109
Don't worry for your friend...

427
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,270
he's at peace now...

428
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,150
but you're alive.

429
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,314
You have to take the next step now.

430
00:43:11,496 --> 00:43:14,636
No!
Next?

431
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,029
My next step...

432
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,039
will be my last.

433
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,216
Understand?

434
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,820
Thank you.

435
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,036
Thank you, thank you.
Now...

436
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,840
since you're here, please,
give me the radio.

437
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,440
Give me the radio, watch, and backpack then.
You just take the radio.

438
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,176
Please.

439
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,000
The radio is useless.

440
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,256
There's no music now.

441
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,640
No dancing.

442
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,030
No, you didn't understand, I need to...
You need to take next step.

443
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,856
Wait.

444
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,096
Where are you going?

445
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,029
And why are you walking like that?

446
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,469
Do you know where the mines are?

447
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,594
Because I have one under my foot!

448
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,715
I'm on a mine,
so there's no next step for me!

449
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,936
Understood, asshole?

450
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,394
You must always keep going.

451
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,976
What an idiot.

452
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,376
Come on, Marine.

453
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,195
This is a simple mission.

454
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,030
This is better than nothing.

455
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,136
Wait...

456
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,176
Be careful...

457
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,776
Thank you.

458
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,096
Thank you thank you...

459
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,199
Can you tell your father
that I thank you...

460
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,954
very, very much...

461
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,519
and I am very, very grateful?

462
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,434
Look what you have.

463
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,696
A...

464
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,520
a soldier!

465
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,176
Like this.

466
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,810
I have one myself.

467
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,136
Is this yours?

468
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,456
I'm stuck.

469
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,336
I can't move.

470
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,096
Since you're here...

471
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,152
Would you mind
going over there to get that radio?

472
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,336
Right there,

473
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,776
in the bag.

474
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,194
Would you get it for me, please?

475
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,593
Please, get me to the radio.

476
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,616
It's right there.

477
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,753
At least look where I'm pointing.
Get on the radio!

478
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,716
The radio!

479
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,096
No, wait!

480
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,816
Wait...

481
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Wait, no...

482
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,595
I was not scolding.

483
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,034
Just I am trying to
get the radio...

484
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,736
Your Highness...

485
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,517
This secret message
is your amulet. It will...

486
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,999
be able to protect you from evil forces,
my knight...

487
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,434
Don't worry, ok?

488
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,673
I know you have to leave...

489
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,634
so, go...

490
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,158
defeat your demons as a
knight in shining armor.

491
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,397
without blemish and without fear.

492
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,959
I'm sure it's going to go well...

493
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,216
I know.

494
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,120
But don't take too long.

495
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,517
Win this war and come back to me,

496
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,240
Otherwise...

497
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,990
I'll have to find another guy...

498
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,956
A Delta Force type...

499
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,470
or maybe a Ranger.

500
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,196
I love you,

501
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,514
You're a lucky man!

502
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,130
Here we go again.

503
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,656
Look, man...

504
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,872
I'm not in the mood
for your bullshit...

505
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,878
I didn't sleep so well last night.

506
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,836
What's your name?

507
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,956
Mike.

508
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,319
"Mike" in your language and
"Man who can't take the next step" in mine!

509
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,432
Mike is Michael.

510
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,354
But what would a Berber know.

511
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,950
Mike and Michael.

512
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,040
You called me "Berber"...

513
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,195
but you know what a Berber is?

514
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,216
I know.

515
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,639
He's a guy who won't
get the radio even if you ask him.

516
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,790
I bet that your daughter brought me the
water bottle yesterday without telling you.

517
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,676
In my language...

518
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,074
Berber means free man.

519
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,275
Why aren't you a free man?

520
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,234
Ok. Ok.
You stepped on a mine...

521
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,040
in the end...

522
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,596
but you're a very lucky man.

523
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,698
You step on a mine and it doesn't explode.

524
00:55:50,709 --> 00:55:52,998
You spend the night in the desert and
the animals leave you alone.

525
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,877
You're a very lucky man, Mike and Michael!

526
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,496
Good.

527
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,976
Thank you.

528
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,879
Now can we...
Mike and Michael...

529
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,234
Why did you step on the mine?

530
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,594
i didn't know there was a mine...

531
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,678
when I stepped.

532
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,309
I don't know where the mines are,
like you do!

533
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,720
You're wrong, Mike and Michael.

534
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,719
We don't know where the mines are.

535
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,312
I saw you walk around,

536
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,710
going all zig-zag.

537
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,636
You know the paths.

538
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,910
I don't know where the mines are.

539
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,732
If I walk straight into a minefield...

540
00:56:31,784 --> 00:56:34,032
sooner or later,
I'll step on a mine, for sure.

541
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,156
I figured out what your problem is...

542
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,820
you're scared.

543
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,476
Come on, really?

544
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,740
Don't tell me.

545
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,194
No, you don't understand.

546
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,195
No matter where you are now,
it only matters where you want to go.

547
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,994
I just want to go to my house...

548
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,156
to my family.

549
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,073
I only follow my destiny.

550
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,791
It seems that my destiny is still here.

551
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,313
I made my last misstep.

552
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:21,490
Every day you step
may be your last step.

553
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,080
So what's the difference today?

554
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,991
The difference is that today...

555
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,474
I know that,
even if I was a lucky man...

556
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,237
I have only a 7%
chance of not dying.

557
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,589
7%

558
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,576
Good.

559
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,830
So, it was all incredibly
philosophical and everything...

560
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,456
but could you please...

561
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,336
bring me...

562
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,320
my radio?

563
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,576
Thank you.

564
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,392
Ready? No, I'm busy!

565
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,156
Why did you step on the mine?

566
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,713
Because we were marching
toward the village.

567
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,836
Why get to the village?

568
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,314
Because we were lost in the desert.
Why in the desert?

569
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,910
Because that was our mission.
Why mission?

570
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,118
Because we're at war.

571
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,319
And why are you at war?

572
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,512
You want to kill the enemy?

573
00:58:55,845 --> 00:58:58,036
No.
I am a soldier.

574
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,150
And why are you a soldier?

575
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,576
Because...

576
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,914
I had no reasons to stay.

577
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,760
I had no more.

578
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,993
Why "no more"?

579
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,952
You still want the radio?

580
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,434
Become a free man!

581
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,833
You must go on.

582
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,757
The wrong path can take you home too.

583
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,475
I won't ever give up.

584
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,514
Stay alive, man!

585
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,976
It'll be fine

586
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,475
It'll all be fine.

587
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,176
Shut up.

588
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,234
You're the one whose gone,

589
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,795
Shut up.

590
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,434
What else could I do?

591
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,557
Where were you when she was sick?

592
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,599
Please, do me a favor
and leave me alone.

593
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,376
Now what do you want?

594
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,876
You disappeared to...

595
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,834
who knows where, all these years...

596
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,396
and now you come back
and you want to talk?

597
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,176
Ok.

598
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,736
Let's talk.

599
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,176
We're here...

600
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,536
it's a perfect opportunity.

601
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,716
What's up, huh?

602
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,536
Don't you dare mention it!

603
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,119
Don't you dare even say his name!

604
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,599
Who got to you, man?

605
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,096
Tommy?

606
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,639
You're a real disaster.

607
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,199
Let's roll, soldier.

608
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,234
We have to go home.

609
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,831
Or do you think Jenny
will be waiting forever?

610
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,480
Do not worry, my friend.

611
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,510
Not going anywhere.

612
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,896
It's useless.

613
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,836
The train is coming.

614
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,913
We'll call them
when we get the signal.

615
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:02,231
So you don't need to keep calling them.
You'll just kill the batteries.

616
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,036
Right?

617
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,590
Right.

618
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,590
Come on, Mike.

619
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,194
Stop it, please.

620
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,760
It's just your imagination.

621
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,674
It's impossible that your phone rings
here, in the middle of the desert.

622
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,856
Look.

623
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,073
Dad

624
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,799
This can't happen...

625
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,050
and you know it, right?

626
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,558
You don't know shit, Tom!

627
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,595
You know what? It's true.

628
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,871
You never had the balls to tell me
anything about what's eating you.

629
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,910
I'm sorry, Tom.

630
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,959
You have left when you were most needed.

631
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,278
Just like I did with Jenny.

632
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:07,440
Is not the same thing.

633
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,874
I'm just like him!

634
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,096
No, that's not true.

635
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,359
That's why you'll go back to Jenny.

636
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,514
Because she loves you...

637
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,309
for what you are.

638
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,995
Because she's waiting for you...

639
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,478
and that's why
you have to stay alive.

640
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,336
Attention.

641
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,190
I have enough ammo for them all!

642
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,835
You're right,
we know the maneuver.

643
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,999
What maneuver?
The maneuver, the Schumann Maneuver!

644
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,594
You're kidding,
it's never going to work!

645
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,154
If animals are attacking
you all at once.

646
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,113
they'll make you fall
and the mine will explode!

647
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:31,874
Quick, there's no time!

648
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,496
Yes, exactly.

649
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,995
You must attach the sole to the ground.

650
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,480
It should work.

651
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,240
The mine sensor won't sense
the pressure change immediately.

652
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,635
Do you know anyone there who did it?

653
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,230
Bravo!

654
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,997
At least we'll be able to get
a few tenths of a second more!

655
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,395
You may not get out in one piece,
but at least get out alive!

656
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,550
Now, Marine...

657
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,176
Dig!

658
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,596
That's bullshit!

659
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,740
Go ahead!

660
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,479
Don't stop!

661
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,510
Strength!

662
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,670
Keep digging!

663
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,574
Dig, Marine, dig!

664
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,380
Strength!

665
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,358
Mike, do it now.

666
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,216
Do it now!

667
01:07:41,315 --> 01:07:43,616
Your Highness...

668
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,119
I solemnly swear...

669
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,398
to be a brave knight,

670
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,509
Reverent...

671
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,509
and always friendly.

672
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,555
A champion...

673
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,758
in truth and justice.

674
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,576
I solemnly swear...

675
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,836
to be honest...

676
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,536
and good.

677
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,870
I swear...

678
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,234
to protect our Kingdom.

679
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,993
And I swear it all...

680
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,000
in your presence...

681
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,040
my princess.

682
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,360
Now can I have that beer,

683
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,736
please?

684
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,136
Margo 4...

685
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,976
Alpha Margo 4,

686
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,776
This is Oxen.

687
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,960
Do you copy?

688
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,216
Over.

689
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,076
Oxen. Oxen, I'm here...

690
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,416
Alpha...
Alpha Margo...

691
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,056
It's me.

692
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,016
It's Mike.

693
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,016
Copy.

694
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,920
Copy, Alpha Margo 4...

695
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,833
The convoy for the extraction
is on the way.

696
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,676
Echo Bravo 3 is coming in your direction,
Sergeant...

697
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,836
The convoy is requesting...

698
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,960
Eco Bravo 3 and is still under fire.

699
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,116
They are delayed.

700
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,313
The new ETA for the extraction
is now 17 hours.

701
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,016
Did you copy that, Sergeant?

702
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,516
You've got to last
another 17 hours, Sergeant.

703
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,136
Can you do it?

704
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,456
I can't.

705
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,096
Sergeant Stevens...

706
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,477
I'd like to mention that
we have someone here.

707
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,394
Given his situation, we decided
to call his...over.

708
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,336
Is it Jenny?

709
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,840
May I please speak with Jenny?

710
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,914
Communication unclear...

711
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,216
Do you copy?

712
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,256
Can you hear me?

713
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,656
Sweetheart?

714
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,475
Jenny, I'm sorry.

715
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,671
I ruined everything, like always.

716
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,075
But at least this time,
don't say it's okay.

717
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,176
There's no need...

718
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,040
to say that "this is the deal,"

719
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,878
I can't adjust and
I ruin everything.

720
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,909
Because I broke our pact.

721
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,236
I shouldn't have left.

722
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,616
I should have stayed.

723
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,552
I had to make a lot of changes...

724
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,600
but everything I touch falls apart.

725
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,911
All the good things are destroyed.

726
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,756
And that's why I'm here.

727
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,316
I'm a free man but not always a lucky one.

728
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,116
When the mine took my leg...

729
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,400
I thought my life was over.

730
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,794
I remember it like it was yesterday.

731
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,552
I was so afraid in the hospital.

732
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,136
I only thought...

733
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,914
My leg is gone.

734
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,119
I only thought about all the
things I could never do anymore.

735
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,555
There was a radio...

736
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,310
that played music in the hospital.

737
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:47,016
The singer said...

738
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,989
"You always have to keep going,

739
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,955
you always have to keep going. "

740
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,080
But I didn't listen to the singer.

741
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,311
I only thought of my leg.

742
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,960
My leg was gone.

743
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,597
How everything could
only be bad in my future.

744
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,758
Then, in comes a nurse...

745
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,957
and she smiles...

746
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,793
at me!

747
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,269
So I listen to the song.

748
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:23,159
"You always have to keep going,

749
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,514
you always have to keep going. "

750
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,276
Maybe this bad thing...

751
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,759
was the only way to get
to something beautiful.

752
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,560
And so I met my wife.

753
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,810
She took care of me.

754
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,474
And our children were born.

755
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,673
My life with only one leg...

756
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,336
it's beautiful.

757
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,136
You understand what I'm saying?

758
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,296
Now.

759
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,356
This will make you crazy.

760
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,416
You...

761
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,112
you'll see things...

762
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,710
and then everything will be fine.

763
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,216
Drink.

764
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,469
I've seen your daughter.

765
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,080
She brought the bottle.

766
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,176
I...

767
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,829
brought you water bottle...

768
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,376
Mike and Michael.

769
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,357
They are wrong to think
they are unlucky...

770
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,478
and a really beautiful little girl.

771
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,520
She has your smile.

772
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,795
I have only 3 sons now.

773
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,033
My little girl was with me...

774
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,916
when the mine exploded...

775
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,296
many years ago.

776
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:51,875
We gathered mines together...

777
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,996
Selling them to the guerrillas.

778
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,475
Very valuable, those mines.

779
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,674
We were very poor...

780
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,850
and she was very good.

781
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,550
She would take a stick...

782
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,314
and poke it sideways.

783
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,119
She'd find a mine...

784
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,152
and then carefully dig, dig, dig.

785
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,278
She pulled out the mine...

786
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,116
and put old cans.

787
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,672
Metal detectors can't find makeup.

788
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,590
Then, one day...

789
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,359
a mine takes my leg.

790
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,136
I'm not so lucky.

791
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,416
I live..

792
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,752
and her fate came before mine.

793
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,560
But I'm happy...

794
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,280
that the desert makes jokes
and lets you meet her.

795
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,056
I lost so much...

796
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,558
when she stepped on the mine that day...

797
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:00,517
because I am not
a very lucky man like you.

798
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,154
But I'm a free man.

799
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,120
I moved on.

800
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,478
I always move on.

801
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,756
That's why you always have to keep going.

802
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,114
I always take the next step,

803
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,120
although next step may be difficult...

804
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,750
too big...

805
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,794
and scarey.

806
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,632
You know how not to be afraid?

807
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,036
I have to become...

808
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,270
a free man.

809
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,096
Don't go...

810
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,674
Don't leave me too...

811
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,235
I have some problems,

812
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,056
The guys at work...

813
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,109
I don't think they like me...

814
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,229
I don't know, maybe
you just need to relax.

815
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,517
Tell me, you call this respect?

816
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,273
I'm sorry, I was just trying
to understand the situation,

817
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,840
Tell me, Rose, do you call this respect?
I'm sorry.

818
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,790
I don't. I'll show you, Rose.

819
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,954
I respect you, Bob. You know.

820
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,439
Just don't do that, okay?

821
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,850
Mike's awake.

822
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,176
Please.

823
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,160
I don't care who wakes up, you hear?

824
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,915
In my house.

825
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,198
And I deserve respect from you, Rose!

826
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,999
Did you understand?
I get it.

827
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,390
I respect you, Bob.
You know I respect you.

828
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,473
It's like a war out there, you know?

829
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,160
To find the money to feed you!

830
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,833
For you and that kid!

831
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,960
Maybe...

832
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,200
try to...

833
01:19:22,205 --> 01:19:25,193
I don't know, don't drink too much,
maybe he can help...

834
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,192
Shut up, Rose!

835
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:30,936
Hello, sweetheart.

836
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,656
Hey, Mikey.

837
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,616
I woke you up?

838
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,280
You have something to say, boy?

839
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,839
I get it. Come on, boy!

840
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,000
I'm right here!

841
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:47,231
You peed in the bed?
You're a baby, remember that.

842
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,997
You wet the bed, Mikey?
Leave him alone, he's a child.

843
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,136
Rose!

844
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,456
Shut up, Rose!

845
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,472
Get out of this house! Get out!

846
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,313
And you call this respect?

847
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,471
At your age, boy... I was a man.

848
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,350
Don't you dare talk to me
like that in front of Mikey!

849
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,277
Mikey, you don't
have the balls, kid!

850
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:12,750
No problem, Mikey.
Now I'll show you how to become a man.

851
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,676
You have something to say, boy?

852
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,955
Listen!

853
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,630
I'm right here!

854
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,616
Strength.

855
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,240
Come on, boy!

856
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,238
I'm right here!
I'm right here,

857
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,193
Wait a minute, darling.

858
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,159
Why such a hurry? Sit with us
for a bit. What'll it cost you?

859
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,634
I won't bite, you'll see!

860
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,791
It's really the
wrong night for this, okay?

861
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,439
So let's make it the right night!

862
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,540
Come on, dear.

863
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,835
Come on, sit here.

864
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,349
Got something to say?

865
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,470
I feel you.

866
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,876
I feel you.

867
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,959
Come on, boy.
I'm right here.

868
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,816
Hey, Mike! Mike! Mike!

869
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,296
Look at me.

870
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,150
You see, down there at the bottom?

871
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,040
The cavalry is finally coming.

872
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,936
It's a mirage.

873
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,594
I can't go on.
No.

874
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,680
No, Mike.

875
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:40,399
It's not a mirage.

876
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,976
I'm here, my friend.

877
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:44,916
It's not a mirage!

878
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,317
We have to tell them that we're here...

879
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,000
or they won't find us.

880
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,035
Alpha Margo 4, Alpha Margo 4...

881
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,720
Echo Bravo 3 coming,

882
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,314
Where, Sergeant Stevens?

883
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,150
Signals your pos...

884
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:01,440
I'm here!

885
01:24:01,445 --> 01:24:03,113
Alpha Margo 4, we're leaving.

886
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,112
I'm down here!
We can't stay long!

887
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,554
We don't see the Sergeant, where is he?

888
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,316
No, I'm here!

889
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,430
I'm here!

890
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,000
Come on, Mike.

891
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,590
Mike, we have to go.

892
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,250
You have to concentrate.

893
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,536
Here...

894
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,719
a small step for mankind...

895
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,536
but...

896
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,434
a big step for a man.

897
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,060
Can you hear me?

898
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,216
You better get moving!

899
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,500
I'm here!

900
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,656
?Why are you getting married.

901
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,976
Do you remember me?

902
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,850
Do you remember?

903
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,190
You're dead.

904
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,040
Tommy died.

905
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,476
Render unto you homage to the crown

906
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,916
and sworn allegiance to our Kingdom.

907
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,656
Your Highness...

908
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,879
I solemnly swear...

909
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,714
to be a brave knight.

910
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,234
Reverent and always polite...

911
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,155
a champion of truth and justice...

912
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,639
and I solemnly swear
to be honest and good.

913
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,474
I swear to protect our Realm.

914
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,754
And I swear it all in your presence...

915
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,536
my princess.

916
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,856
I want it!

917
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,656
What do you want?

918
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,910
I want you to be...

919
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,430
a brave knight.

920
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,159
It remains alive, Mike and Michael.

921
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,313
You have to let me go, Mike,

922
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:31,920
Don't be afraid if
the suffering stops, honey.

923
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,436
I'm not afraid...

924
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,030
not anymore.

925
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,119
You're a strong guy.

926
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,030
You're honest...

927
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,530
and you're good.

928
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,714
And I know that nothing will
ever be able to stop you.

929
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,656
Never.

930
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,760
But you have to let me go.

931
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,440
You have to move on.

932
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,536
Come on, boy.

933
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,656
I'm right here.

934
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,480
Now I can have one beer, please?

935
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,016
Jenny?

936
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,360
It's why you're here, Mike.

937
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,176
Why you're here.

938
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:18,240
You have to move on.

939
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,273
7%...

940
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:18,950
good.

941
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,710
You always have to go on...

942
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:32,553
You always have to go on...

943
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:10,688
