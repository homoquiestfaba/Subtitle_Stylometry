I do not care if it is in Barbados.

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,437
I need the data directly.

100
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,580
Ryan, you're right or left handed?
- Using the right hand. Why?

101
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,796
because you will not need the left.

102
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,020
even if you do not

107
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,071
have divided us, me and Pete.
It takes on technical analysis...

108
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,517
Believe me,
best is the single point of contact.

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,071
So go forward, forward courageously. - Well.

110
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,620
Well. As you know, the reason
Currently we alkylating agents

111
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,780
severe hair loss,
above-average risk of infection

112
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,340
and severe weight loss.

113
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,700
we have developed a new method,
improves the effectiveness of the medication

114
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,860
at a time and one of the side effects
reduced, without the slightest doubt.

115
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,380
If you want to look at it?
- When I asked in the market?

116
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,518
test series with tissue cultures
is not yet complete...

117
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,356
then leave your report
here temporarily, and we will contact.

118
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,920
Well, that's all.

119
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,630
Thank you.

120
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,992
starts UltriTech
patient tries to six weeks.

121
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,633
Why? Experiments with humans?

122
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,100
yet
thought they would be the first in four months?

123
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,670
seems as if they have
miracles and mid-heavy.

124
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,700
any chance,
because we can not keep up.

125
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,740
've been making recently,
test tissue samples.

126
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,118
I'm afraid you do not quite understand how
threatening situation.

127
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,820
keep your cool, okay?

128
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,700
for more than eight months
now we have poured our ass.

129
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,460
and do not even ask for it.
Fuck with side effects.

130
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,260
we are making great progress so far.
- Oh really? Ryan, is that so?

131
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,260
drugs, as well as all the rest:
Letsipan, Nostaran, Triclostan.

132
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,220
this is all just poison,
is pasted on a beautiful name.

133
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,340
if they were "marzipan" call,
if they promise them more buyers.

134
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,477
What do you expect?
There is a miracle cure?

135
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,060
What is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?

136
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,580
at Harvard University, we all agreed.
We wanted to be different.

137
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,780
we wanted to share
to find an effective treatment.

138
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,940
look around again, Beth.

139
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,997
Harvard is long gone.

140
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,358
This is about profit.

141
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,940
afraid
on ScopaMed cocktail brainwashing

142
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,997
you sipped a little more often.

143
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,676
long but is no longer necessary.

144
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,557
thou hast promised?

145
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,600
and when are you going
me to admit that?

146
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,352
sorry if you cut,
but the new ones will be there.

147
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,032
Yes. All right.

148
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,660
If we do not  before UltriTech
relationship with a drug to market,

149
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,420
this company go down the drain.

150
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,980
but authorities
human experiments allow only

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,900
in the case of a report of toxicity.

152
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,220
in itself,
three months experimenting with mice.

153
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,740
skip rat experiments.

154
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,240
No, certainly not.

155
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,513
this is impossible.

156
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,400
our agreement so I wanted to explode?

157
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,391
moment.
What you requested, I have done.

158
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,380
and we agreed on:
this time only.

159
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,519
I'm sorry,
but for the second time not to do so.

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,192
is the son of a passionate football player, I hear.

161
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,109
Why?

162
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,311
would be unfortunate if you would miss their games.

163
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,060
What does that mean?

164
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,100
not sure how easy,
prison to see how his son grow up.

165
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,191
So you're threatening me with the police.

166
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,100
forget
because we both stuck in it. - We both?

167
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,430
never. No, Ted.

168
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,637
you are alone.

169
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,236
not even under
path leads to me.

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,180
your word against mine.

171
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,380
which is before the jury
perhaps more credible?

172
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,020
general manager
a successful business,

173
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,420
ten million annually
donate to the poor,

174
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,100
or biochemistry
with his ex-wife addicted to drugs?

175
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,635
for two years and is now clean.

176
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,718
Ted,
there is only one, what I ask.

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,877
make it easy again.

178
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,079
which included,
it the last time?

179
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,796
you would be right
convince your son's life?

180
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,820

00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,993

182
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,080

183
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,300
What was the name of this camp for football, of which
constantly talking about, again? Madrid like?

184
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,460
Youth Camp Real Madrid.

185
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,460
You can even tonight

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,300
We fly tomorrow to go early.

189
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,580
will need your passport. This is why...
- my mom has a pass, I ask them the same thing.

190
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,980
No, no, no.

191
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,074
tell her something.
This is our little secret.

192
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,700
we keep this to ourselves, okay?

193
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,820
Yes, of course.

194
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,718
see you tomorrow morning.

195
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,396

196
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,470

197
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,392
just been delivered.

198
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,740
and the rest of the ship?

199
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,910
This  everything.

200
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,316
I was ten.
Sleep again.

201
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,140
will test for us here
novel agent for chemotherapy.

202
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,540
even marketing experts
think of something better

203
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,180
We continue to call it love:
ER-WYE-THREE-FOUR-ONE.

204
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,860
In the first step, we extract
cell culture bottles in the freezer compartment

205
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,020
The temperature in the incubator for two hours.

206
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,460
then
living cells counted.

207
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,871
Yes, there
then waits until the security field.

208
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,879
and when you listen to?

209
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,875
I will not leave the store without you.

210
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,236
three weeks ago in
vacant, Beth.

211
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,620
have something for you,
if you are interested.

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,100
meckerst you're constantly on the job
and if you are honest,

213
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,114
there's no reason one
does not stop here. But you can stay.

214
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,992
in UltriTech want you too.

215
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,400
and even want
search box.

216
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,780
under any circumstances and allows you to
depending idea come to enter this room here.

217
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,860
I suppose you know what damage both
havoc oncogenic virus in the bloodstream?

218
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,300
good, but mentally
multiplies by ten.

219
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,380
particular strain of
Merkel cell polyomavirus,

220
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,860
we have developed here, cause
and accelerated tumor growth.

221
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,035
In other words, if you are infected you,
hope to have something to be desired.

222
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,431
George, hand me out a lot?

223
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,140
this installment has ended
carried to the bench sterile,

224
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,517
where the virus then you need to inject the cells in the culture.

225
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,673
Why are you doing it for you hard?

226
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,100
we both get better jobs,
earn much more than that.

227
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,300
We finally
afford an apartment together.

228
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,279
or ScopaMed UltriTech,
where is the difference?

229
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,637
what you merely as a Funk?

230
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,100
for hundreds of years, you tell me
you want to develop a cure.

231
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,873
but this is nothing but talk.

232
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,780
you give blame ScopaMed,
but you know how it is in reality?

233
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,439
do not have the courage.

234
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,795
because it can be so,
to fail.

235
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,060
House Wakefield, par excellence
Biochemistry his Ph.D.,

236
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,980
can fail, with drums and trumpets
. - You are such a fool.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,460
No, I'm just honest and admit:

238
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,980
I want a good life and
a good job. I have not hidden.

239
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,340
I am no different from the others,
but... - and my dreams are stupid?

240
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,397
not. Absolutely not.

241
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,060
I would like to heartily
and with all the violence that success.

242
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,438
but if this process does not work,
have at least try.

243
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,100
and? What's going on?

244
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,860
In fact, a lot of talk, but for
protein degradation is still dramatic.

245
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,191
verify the results of the phosphate.
In writing to me, okay?

246
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,837
house is still in the house, right?

247
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,700
minutes before and she was still there, but...

248
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,140

leave the company,

249
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,790

250
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,630

251
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,140

252
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,100
in fact I wanted to today's times

253
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,952

254
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,949
Well. Okay.

255
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,714
hello, my friend.

256
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,837

257
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,380

261
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,100
he might again today

262
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,740
We spent only
perform EKG and...

263
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,780
now unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy

264
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,620
is an increased risk of heart attack .
- and this means in plain text?

265
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,980
chemotherapy
hurt the heart of your husband.

266
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,469
that heart disease is not curable.

267
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,260
in eight months, and he is
cancer and chemotherapy

268
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,820
shade
become his country.

269
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,540
in a lot of blood...
and he had to pass the time.

270
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,060
says he does not care as long as he
only survived, and now...

271
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,700
since you tell me if
survived cancer,

272
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,900
then died of heart disease?

273
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,072
our drug,
still keep it stable for a period of time...

274
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,140

279
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,038

280
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,780

cell cultures missing?

285
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,032

well, then he is still in the workplace,
Could you please put me through to him?

292
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,620
The way I see it here, he was one and a half hours
sixth in the basement.

293
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,500
sixth in the basement?

294
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,980
Are you sure? This is quite
closed for many years.

295
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,037
have anyway on the screen.

296
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,300
Well, you could probably go down
and ask him about the number?

297
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,940
I like to do,
but we do not have access even down there.

298
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,273
Well. If you see him, tell him,
he wants to call me? - If I did.

299
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,515

300
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,033
and he is still on the road.

301
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,838
thousand dollars immediately.

302
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,439
then again
1000 $ after treatment.

303
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,239
During the treatment you need
stay here in this room.

304
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,354
be done on your own personal safety.

305
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,677
I will not hurt you.

306
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,672
lie down on the bed again.

307
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,792
take fucking money back.

308
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,473
post again.

309
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,039

310
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,540
Ryan and honest...

311
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,980
... Do you really think
UltriTech funded research?

312
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,980
say so,
fell as your name, I saw,

313
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,152
as if they had just
super jackpot in Las cracked.

314
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,871
Well, I'm with you. - Really?

315
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,340
just like that?

316
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,380
and you do not want to only two or three
nights sleeping on it for safety reasons?

317
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,995
not.
No, you're right.

318
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,632
I want to continue with the search and
I've been waiting a very long time.

319
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,760
I was scared.

320
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,740
I was afraid if I were not successful, DASS ..

321
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,991
Hey, you know, you're not alone.

322
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,520
right.

323
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,120
Thank you.

324
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,460
New York is sure to please you.

325
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,100
I know a little bit of pizza
on the Lower East Side, where...

326
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,460
you could have been thinking,
to live in the state of Montana?

327
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,918
on your farm? - Lack of guidance yet
of course, but maybe in the future.

328
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,860
so you before,
to settle?

329
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,060
No, I'm just asking because...

330
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,180
Now, before you ask any further,
should not correct to kneel?

331
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,958
No, I want you, but no application
make, it's just a question for you.

332
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,959
should I do it?

333
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,033
what a marriage proposal?

334
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,839
Why? You've got to
do not happen to have a ring there?

335
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,594
not.

336
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,151
but I know the mortgagee in
James Wall, who may still have homework.

337
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,872
really? - Yes.

338
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,354
really.

339
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,470
Ted!

340
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,820
Hey, you glow Yes.

341
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,980
have infected me with the virus.

342
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,540
Oh, my God. And how?
- Is completely unimportant.

343
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,820
I'll call an ambulance.
- They can not do anything for me. - Is right.

344
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,700
only one thing still preserves life.

345
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,140
and that would be?
- Go to my computer.

346
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,518
use the following login data!
Username: Lionel Stanton.

347
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,476

348
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,580
O God, your hand.

349
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,435
I think I broke three fingers.
- on the one hand I connect you at the moment.

350
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm sorry,
I want you both there with reinziehen.

351
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,433
ACCESS TO secure files

352
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,592
AP: Laboratory 18.24
station security camera

353
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,060
a file should be called DCA.

354
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,140
Have you found it? - Yes!

355
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,719
Yes, I think so.

356
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,060
in any section
been designed for?

357
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,100
Thus, the molecular structure
I've never seen.

358
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,271
This is the active ingredient of the drug.

359
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,340
for one, that cures cancer.

360
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,714
you Schweinepriester.

361
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,516
I just said "the treatment of cancer?"

362
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,637
moment. Wait a minute.

363
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,900
so...

364
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,278
claim that through this molecule
here is cured cancer?

365
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,220
Oh my God, this is incredible.

366
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,390
who developed it?

367
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,753
Lionel.

368
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,900
Lionel?

369
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,060
that does not make any sense.

370
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,700
I mean, a cure for cancer,
so you can earn billions.

371
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,860
we can make billions already.

372
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,940
If this drug comes
cancer than ever before in the market...

373
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,020
then no one needs to
chemotherapy drugs we have.

374
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,396
SopaMed
will probably bankrupt.

375
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,873
Since when?

376
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,952
How long have you had?

377
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,120
Since when, Ted?

378
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,832
for a ten-year-old.

379
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,830
shit.

380
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,420
you also only have the slightest idea,

381
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,380
how many people at this time
have suffered and belted miserable?

382
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,140
km from children's
was terrible as they lose their parents?

383
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,500
How many
mothers and fathers were forced to

384
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,140
just watch her swoon,
how their children suffered the torment of hell,

385
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,580
and you have a chance to finish it?
- I know only that very year.

386
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,877
I did not have any choice, my son...
- not! Puke on me!

387
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,740
FILE ON USB STICK COPY

388
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,620
finish

389
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,620
What do you do? - I'm doing this,
what you are before a ten-year-old has had to do!

390
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,677
will publish it. - Wait.

391
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,551
18 laboratory BLOCK?
Yes - No

392
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,940
wait!
Let's look briefly again.

393
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,340
What is there to think about?
- you want to publish a simple?

394
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,432
This is not a question!
- For anyone but deserves recognition.

395
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,260
Why?

396
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,591
want me to write:
in love, for you, Lionel Stanton?

397
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,260
not. - And I will be anonymous
download server of the University, which is fine.

398
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,820
I just say, house,
were not actually have thought through.

399
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,479
this is a big deal.

400
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,940
cure for cancer
there is a Nobel Prize.

401
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,540
Ryan.

402
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,820
people who are dying, and we can put an end to
, and in fact now.

403
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,595
I know. I know that, but what if it did not work
stuff?

404
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,180
thinking about the millions of patients
people in this world.

405
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,955
What if you put into the net
then nothing worth?

406
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,636
would be better if we know for sure.

407
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,794
right?

408
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,277
how long it takes to manufacture?

409
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,959
about forty minutes.

410
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,952
I have a job for you and your team.

411
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,420
when? - At the moment.

412
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,100
If you've passed through the main gate,
moved to the back of the building.

413
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,820
in the loading dock, and you will find a box
with everything you need for the job.

414
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,500
Where is the target?
- Laboratory eighteen.

415
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,196
symbols GPS data and access
you will find in the package.

416
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,680
and do not forget Yes,
must look like an accident.

417
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,380
and how they look?

418
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,869
very good.
Just two steps to the goal.

419
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,715
We are on the road.

420
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,860
VIRUS ALERT
check - news

421
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,679
VIRUS ALERT TRIGGER?
Yes - No

422
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,520
virus has broken out
So the alarm!

423
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,420
not!

424
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,620
you must bring it to an end. - If we
are dead, we offer something to the end!

425
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,940
Ryan!

426
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,792
will come back.

427
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,430
come.

428
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,518
Access Denied

429
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,100
my card does not work!
- Tried my visits. - For the moment.

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,632
Access Denied

431
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,180
Hey!

432
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,350
we are still here!

433
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,460
spread your
your men into two groups,

434
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,676
and gives each floor
down from the fifth floor.

435
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,960
Hey! - Hey!
- Get us out of here!

436
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,100
is to break down the door! Help!

437
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,600
us out!

438
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,397
This has no purpose,
they're all gone.

439
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,240
wait, I have an idea!

440
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,396
I have this range already
examination, and here no more.

441
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,430
one team,
meet at the main entrance.

442
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,270
way there, go!

443
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,552
ACCESS-CODE 7239

444
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,390
Come on!

445
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,476
ALARM virus outbreak
statement: armed - a statement: NORMAL

446
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,600
this is a good thing, right? - Of course.

447
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,270
Hey!

448
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,000
Did you hear that?

449
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,420
you take care of this,
that people go to the 100 meters back.

450
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,512
that is, the required safety distance
, okay?

451
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,837
Come on, open the door!

452
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,637
all of you will be a little farther back, please!

453
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,060
I understand well,
you're all shocked.

454
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,860
disaster management team has already arrived.

455
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,270
currently investigating the building.

456
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,020
but due to the risk of
may have possible contamination

457
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,500
spread outside this area can
, nor shall any one,

458
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,673
out of the building,
disasters give us the OK.

459
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,434
mobile phones!

460
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,193
moment!

461
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,100
How do you feel?

462
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,839
Do you have a fever, sweating her?

463
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,740
you? - No, I feel fine.
- And that was more than ten minutes.

464
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,913
If you have been exposed to the virus,
'd like to show her symptoms already.

465
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,437
This has been an exercise!

466
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,910
O God.

467
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,740
man, I've been chasing us fear.
- Is the end of the exercise?

468
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,580
what exercise? - That was just a practice
emergency, right?

469
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,740
They are the ones who are still only
here and there? - Yes, I think so.

470
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,820
we have to make sure.
- but we may have yet to come out?

471
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,140
not, we just check
and other laboratories,

472
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,900
person may be included.
Grant is here with you.

473
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,195
Come on guys, let's go.

474
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,710
ACCESS-CODE 5627

475
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,700
I do not understand,
Why should you have to wait your search here.

476
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,189
they are not of the disaster.

477
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,556
what is?
- No idea.

478
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,392
but every bet
We are the only ones here in the building.

479
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,311
Why? It is believed about...
- and we were locked up in the lab,

480
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,740
magnetic cards have not
works, and this is the crux of the matter?

481
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,780
they believe there mixes with Lionel?

482
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,359
I do not know.

483
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,060
but I know I would not be here,
when workers come out of there.

484
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,549
is that the only way out? - No.

485
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,076
Is there a way. - Which one?

486
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,316
you can see the guy from
distract us?

487
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,470
what the heck.

488
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,620
I would have short times to the bathroom, Grant.
- unfortunately not.

489
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,429
is just around the corner, and if you
stand there, keep it in mind.

490
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,830
OK, but hurry, please.

491
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,560
it's okay.

492
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,600
and she knows exactly what she's doing.

493
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,878
Why are you hiding it?

494
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,020
grant, we still
Z minus fifteen minutes.

495
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,394
Please confirm. Ended.

496
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,916
granted!

497
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,799
to make your subject and then
get down to the main entrance.

498
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,153
Where is the exit?

499
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,020
say,
has mixed her treatment.

500
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,220
there is no time, at any moment and
back, tell us immediately. - Do not!

501
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,277
not without drugs.

502
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,900
Where are you going? - Back to the lab
I do not leave here without this formula away.

503
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,435
find another way out. - House!

504
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,870
house!

505
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,910
okay.

506
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,420
grant, do you hear me?

507
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,660
can not even be too far away.

508
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,990
looking there,
intend region.

509
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,075
second.

510
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,350
there is one of these.

511
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,272
Oh, no.
Go do not go there alone.

512
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,116
If we all go,
notice us much sooner. You two wait here.

513
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,200
put this away.

514
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,879
where your friends?

515
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,873
wait down at the entrance.

516
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,397
I'm sorry, my friend.
Not planned to see.

517
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,673
What did you do?

518
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,313
I killed him.

519
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,752
You saved my life.

520
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,790
house.

521
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,780
house, I would have done,
what is required, and the consideration of my face.

522
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,380
you have done what they should do, okay?

523
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,880
okay? Everything is fine.

524
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,839
Oh, shit.

525
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,820
seems that we need
serum rather than we thought.

526
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,700
here below is the bomb.

527
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,540
seems to be high in five minutes.
and then it will spread the virus real.

528
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,940
we have to defuse.
- Do you know how to do it? - No.

529
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,900
then we have to get out of here.

530
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,380
I know
laboratory where we can finish the means.

531
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,580
This is completely tamper.
if they really want to kill us,

532
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,620
why they have not done
at the entrance?

533
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,660
will kill us,
determine police.

534
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,260
but die in the accident,
keep the secret of the tomb.

535
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,840
No, no
If we now call the police.

536
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,797
Let me guess.
line is dead?

537
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,559
could be anywhere else.

538
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,953
steal, do you hear me?

539
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,780
this other output, as long as we need to
about until then?

540
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,700
20 minutes, but this is the
16 minutes more than we have.

541
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,757
so we need more time.

542
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,515
bloody hell!

543
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,877
I ll try with my code.

544
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,551
curse.
Son of a bitch!

545
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,060
one floor down there is still space
security. - What is the benefit?

546
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,400
since we are certainly not pure.

547
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,276
Scheißegal.
Even goes a step aside.

548
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,980
do not think so.

549
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,639
burn in there.

550
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,315
how to burn?
- Fluorine, sulfur acid.

551
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,740
Let's go grouse hunting.
- You're not going to shoot them.

552
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,060
in less than five minutes will
virus spreads throughout the building.

553
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,673
this does the job for us.

554
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,120
all we have!

555
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,634
let me times.

556
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,634
The only question I still
can save, is the treatment. Hurry!

557
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,190
only three minutes!

558
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,674
clouds.

559
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,435
45 seconds!

560
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,080
try the other hand.

561
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,476
nine!

562
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,140
eight!

563
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,140
seven!

564
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,340
six!

565
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,220
five!

566
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,380
four!

567
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,700
three!

568
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,836
two!

569
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,520
now!

570
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,632
contamination detected

571
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,860
Come .
- I forgot a little something.

572
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,020
in the laboratory in the basement 6
you can quit.

573
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,500
6-storey underground?
- As is the output.

574
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,140
this is completely impossible.
- And on top of that very process.

575
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,260
okay.
Well, then you do not believe me.

576
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,060
but it will not be long,
even men again.

577
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,879
you will not be very happy
when they discover their mate.

578
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,878
be produced
treatment and I promise I will take you out of here.

579
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,239
Well, we're in business.

580
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,956
I want to hear it from your mouth, Beth.

581
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,500
promised Ted. - Yes, well.

582
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,749
very good.

583
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,790
if I'm not to spill things,
find me rather than a plastic bottle.

584
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,800
I have!

585
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,320
as well, and we follow you.

586
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,680
okay.
term here!

587
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,592
they are there.
Come back again!

588
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,557
we just go over there to get out!
- No, we must be disposed of somehow.

589
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,020
okay, I do not need two
plastic bottles with screw caps.

590
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,700
and fills it half full with warm water
.

591
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,020
Let's talk with our man,
we will do you no harm!

592
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,360
We know he is in there!

593
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,753
here, and warm water.

594
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,194
What is nonsense?
We break into the store and good.

595
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,754
I think so too.

596
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,393
Well, forward, boys!

597
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,396
hunker down!

598
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,756
they're plastic bottles only.

599
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,715
go!

600
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,959
the elevator does not work,
then we must take the stairs. Go!

601
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,280
will still catch
's alive?

602
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,953
I guess that this was "no."

603
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,754
what's going on?

604
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,475
cursed.

605
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,833
to proceed, and you fucking door!

606
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,074
I correct?
This is the only way out?

607
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,580
in our room maintenance
floor above.

608
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,193
since the must-have tool!

609
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,913
have checked every room.

610
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,753
Come on, please.

611
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,180
hello? - Hey, boy. - Dad?

612
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,759
we have to go very soon.

613
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,980
You can even pack but already
and wait for me outside the front door,

614
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,780
within a few hours and I'm there.
- you, Dad, will teach me Spanish?

615
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,900
Why? - Speaking at a training camp
certainly all Spanish, what do you think?

616
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,199
Yes, of course, no doubt,
course will teach Spanish.

617
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,672
you, Reese? - Yes?

618
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,660
I love you, my son.

619
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,273
I love you too, Dad.

620
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,590
bingo!

621
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,874
do not know,
how to deal with it? - Clear.

622
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,660
I think what.
You have shown your father.

623
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,640
he had to wait until I was eight,
me because before the mask was too big.

624
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,020
welding wire and mask
We also have to take with them.

625
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,750
when we're through, we welding
the other side of the door. - A good idea.

626
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,479
now they will have to rise.

627
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,517
did you weld shut the door?
- There's no time!

628
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,074
okay? - Well.

629
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,914
blast door hinges off.

630
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,500
everything okay? - Let me take a brief pause. -
There is no time, Ted!

631
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,991
chemistry lab
equal right around the corner, behind the offices.

632
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,036
should talk to you alone, Ryan.

633
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,300
Come on, we must go.
- Should we continue?

634
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,039
one minute more.

635
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,180
Well, then you will get it before,
I kümmre him. - What, seriously?

636
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,476
Yes, we immediately thereafter, Beth.

637
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,630
okay.

638
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,034
What is it?

639
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,990
stick?

640
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,140
house has a heart
absolutely in the right place,

641
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,220
but they do not think
tomorrow is still in the future.

642
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,620
even if we get out of here, chasing
Lionel us more, and he will never give up.

643
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,540
if the drug on the market,
go ScopaMed broken. He said he could never be.

644
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,676
Well.

645
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,460
If we set ourselves apart abroad
we might have a chance

646
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,552
but because we need coal.
- you want to sell drugs?

647
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,460
never since they will participate.
- Of course not.

648
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,460
but without the money and we are as good as dead
you just do not think about the future far enough.

649
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,060
This is the reason to have a low
decision.

650
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,030
I promise you, when you were here with
whole skin outside, they will be grateful to you.

651
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,780
Ryan, and here no one doubts
at your wits.

652
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,474
you're also smart enough to follow
house.

653
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,518
I do not follow her,
applied only once.

654
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,700
she did not tell you?
- What you can not say?

655
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,634
she did not start with us,
If we do not offer you a job, too.

656
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,557
thought he knew de

657
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:37,500
Well, I know a few people,
may buy the agent.

658
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,340
from? - UltriTech.

659
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,620
UltriTech? - Not what you think
I have never been spies or so for.

660
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,100
Ryan, I'm a huge pile of shit on
UltriTech or ScopaMed.

661
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,060
We are all on our own.

662
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,900
listen, I convey to you the deal UltriTech
across the stage, and we share the fifth session, okay?

663
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,910
okay.

664
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,876
A condition I would have. - What?

665
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,060
agent working under my name.

666
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,900
what you want?

667
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,820
already clear.
And the Nobel Prize for medicine goes to Ryan Earl.

668
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,300
A million dollars as an encore.
- It's me, but not on coal.

669
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,060
not, in the end I want to
deserve recognition.

670
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,820
I completely
plowed just like home.

671
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,390
of me is the process of
to reduce side effects.

672
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,820
Well, I agree. You reap
glories, but only if you promise

673
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,719
you together
house means herstellst now.

674
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,540
I've already promised.
- the house, and I have my doubts.

675
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,995
was there once and indifferent.
And do it

676
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,431
Well, come on. Come.

677
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,071
moment! What were you doing here?
- What is the question?

678
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,431
this afternoon, I've been here before!

679
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,860
Yes, you are.

680
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,740
I should check to see whether we can put
laboratories old repaired.

681
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,231
I do not believe one word of what you say!

682
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,620
Lionel has his little secret
keep a ten-year-old himself,

683
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,950
But last year, he reveals to you.

684
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,313
what I did,
that this man trusts you?

685
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,200
house, and this does not help us more than that.
We need to help him.

686
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,320
Do you trust him?
- Yes, I do.

687
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,231
then come with me, and I have to show you something.

688
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,140
we do not have time for that.

689
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,871
was right.
Now we need to the lab. - Ryan! Please...

690
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,469
We are more effective when we split.
Radio me when you find them.

691
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,232
What the hell are you doing?
- Ryan, are you following me easy!

692
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,991
Do you still believe in the story of Ted?

693
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,797
it dead

694
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,033

727
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,080
thankfully.

728
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,834

01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,952
and then we can deal with it.

745
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,240

Do you smell that?

749
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,440
No, you can not smell natural.

750
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,716
What do you mean? Spanking Me?

751
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,912
I am a bad time?

752
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,074
Are you okay? - Yes.

753
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,220

there is less smoke.

756
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,580
Clarissa?

757
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,557
Clarissa, this is done, I have medicine!

758
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,315
Clarissa?
Oh no! No, no, no!

759
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,359
Hey, Clarissa!

760
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,835
Clarissa!

761
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,519
What about the father?

762
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,636
but you promised me,
when he gets home!

763
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,112
you'd better stay here.
- Leaving me!

764
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,640

- No, wait!

765
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,197
you know I just formula
you downloaded on your laptop above. - Yes.

766
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,438
I find myself on the corporate network,
also have access from here.

767
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,156
O God...

768
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,549
here is...

769
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,114
shit, but here there is no cable network!

770
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,076
from here is not in his power in the laptop!

771
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,900
What is there to think about?
- you simply want to publish?

772
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,833
Yes, this is probably not a question!
- For anyone but deserves recognition!

773
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,620
this does not help us.
We need to help him.

774
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,313
Do you trust him?

775
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,199
Yes, I do.

776
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,390
God!

777
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,120

778
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,754
What do you do?
- I want the formula!

779
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,358
Write a comment
- I've had to have all the time!

780
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,677
It's not what you think...

781
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,519
Why lie to me?

782
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,916
tell her the truth, Ryan.

783
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,780
we decided to sell the formula to UltriTech

784
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,951
and earnings per share.

785
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,274

786
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,820
Lionel is not us but
just let them get away!

787
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,380
That's why we need money
for a new life, 'understand it yet!

788
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,950
Are you crazy?
- please! Think about it!

789
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,318
How can you?

790
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:45,860
millions of people at this moment in the family home medical, and

791
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,078
and hope and pray
because they desire

792
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,072
one week just to live longer.

793
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:55,672
only one day
or just an hour!

794
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,873
parents who did not experience how
register their daughters to college.

795
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,070
not to mention the graduation ceremony...

796
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,240

01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,953
Oh my God!

800
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:58,470
I'm so sorry incredibly!

801
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,952
my son Reese...

802
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,079
he had a brain tumor,
was unfit for work altogether.

803
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:26,237
A year ago, he had then
of bleeding in the brain sharp.

804
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,740
Lionel did not,
he would have died from it.

805
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,500
gave me medicine,
If you're in the back

806
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,740
illegal human experiments that lead.

807
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,480
I've let myself in it.

808
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,232
I never wanted to,
that someone takes damage.

809
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,315
I just wanted my son to live on.

810
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,711
today, has asked him to do it again.
He threatened to kill Reese.

811
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,352
I did not have any choice.

812
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,912
have hopes that I could get away with Reese.

813
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,100
start a whole new life.

814
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,476
in a distant land.

815
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,076
What a silly idea.

816
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,598
for the rest of our lives we have been on the run!

817
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,596
was constantly lived in fear of our pursuers.

818
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,271
this is not the life for him.

819
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,470
it's worth, but why...

820
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,959
... better.

01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,959

01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,477

875
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,357
four days.

876
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,512
and Ted?

877
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,389
not.

878
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:15,958
I found it here with you in the woods.

879
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,600
and I think that belongs to you.

880
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,239
not.

881
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,754
all people in the world to which it belongs.

882
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,900
As I mentioned earlier today and the two universities

883
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,740
mysterious formula by e
received from an anonymous sender.

884
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,300
it seems, and this is in fact
to be an effective drug for cancer.

885
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,700
course, even
need extensive testing

886
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,820
but at the moment there are all the important breakthrough
about.

887
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,620
yesterday
held 9 Montana Beer Festival

888
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,836
The crowd was phenomenal as always.

889
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,460
in memory of Ellen Gould and all the brave souls who fought
against cancer.

890
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,870
hope we find one day in the drug.
