1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,337
(acoustic guitar music)

2
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,251
(suspenseful music)

3
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,776
(booming explosion)

4
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,621
- [Newscaster] The Wolf
Pack has taken credit

5
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,424
for the destruction of the
UK's most iconic building.

6
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,227
The notorious world
terrorist group

7
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,463
has now carried out
its threat to wage war

8
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:11,165
against all five
permanent members

9
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,167
of the UN Security Council.

10
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,337
It was a devastating attack
to such an iconic monument.

11
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,739
Many lives were lost.

12
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,175
Officials suspect
that the Wolf Pack

13
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,211
had aid from the inside.

14
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,279
It now seems that the
only way to stop them

15
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:29,917
is to find what
authorities name the Alpha.

16
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,386
The leader, of this fanatic
terrorist group, has been

17
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,289
linked to dozens of terror
attacks across the world.

18
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,991
Notably, the bombing
of the Roman Coliseum

19
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,960
and the Taj Mahal.

20
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,995
(suspenseful music)

21
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,464
We live in desperate times.

22
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,666
(banging)

23
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,204
(booming explosions)

24
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:51,239
- [Soldier] Move!

25
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,840
Move!

26
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:53,707
Freeze!

27
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,878
(crunching cereal)

28
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,950
(dramatic music)

29
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:10,791
- Argun.

30
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,962
Argun.

31
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,631
Argun.

32
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,570
(suspenseful music)

33
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:35,616
Argun.

34
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,086
I have a few questions for you.

35
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,689
Where's Alpha?

36
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,558
- I don't know.

37
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,260
- [Kingsley] Oh,
we think you do.

38
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,729
- I've been here five years.

39
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,432
If I knew then, I don't anymore.

40
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:54,167
- [Kingsley] Oh yeah, where
was he five years ago?

41
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,604
- [Argun] Don't you
think I should have told!

42
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,306
(whooshing)

43
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,941
(Argun yelling)

44
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,484
(somber music)

45
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:16,957
(whooshing)
(yelling)

46
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,332
(loud music)

47
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,438
(yelling)
(loud music)

48
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,075
- [Kingsley] Porn.

49
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,547
(loud music)
(yelling)

50
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,602
- Good God, what's that racket?

51
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,103
- [Kingsley]
Classic death metal.

52
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,606
- Well you and
Argun listen to it.

53
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,408
- Well could you turn
it down, you're about

54
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,976
to give me a bad
ecstasy flashback

55
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,878
- [Kingsley] God heavens really?

56
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,246
- Of course, shut the audio off,

57
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,148
we don't want to hear that.

58
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,384
- [Kingsley] No wonder

59
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,317
the terrorists are
kicking our ass.

60
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,756
- Speaking of terrorist,
how's it going this cycle?

61
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,158
- [Kingsley] Well Argun
is the one closest to

62
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,695
break, but the others, they
are fraying at the edges.

63
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,863
- I'm happy to hear that.

64
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,665
What with it being
five years and all.

65
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,801
- [Kingsley] There's one of me,

66
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,335
it's six of them alright?

67
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:39,507
- I speak for the MI6 when I
say you have our full support.

68
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,875
But our partners
aren't as sympathetic

69
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,176
with that ratio considering you

70
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,812
drove off their interrogators.

71
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,447
- [Kingsley] What you
mean the Americans?

72
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,816
- Well they're the straw that
stirs the drink aren't they.

73
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,585
But I mean, all of
them, even the Chinese

74
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,086
are getting antsy,
that's never a good sign.

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,456
- [Kingsley] I still
think it's a bad idea

76
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,124
to put a woman onto the station.

77
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,792
It might excite
the inmates right?

78
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,494
- That was Reiser's call,

79
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,762
and I trust his judgment.

80
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,665
- [Kingsley] Anything else?

81
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,102
- Be polite to the Americans
when they get there.

82
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:12,473
- [Kingsley] Oh okay. (laughs)

83
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:15,543
I'm always polite, I'm British.

84
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,819
(loud music)
(yelling)

85
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,675
(ominous music)

86
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,808
- Docking in 74 minutes.

87
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,145
- [Alex] See anything
interesting en route?

88
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,080
- Just a hammer.

89
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,783
Otherwise same old, same old.

90
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,218
- I meant space junk.

91
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,887
Anything that wouldn't
show up on the radar.

92
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,323
- [Bridges] Why you asking
about space junk huh?

93
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,592
- [Alex] We started
tracking it for Rogue NASA.

94
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,661
- [Bridges] No space
junk Alex, okay.

95
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,395
Take over.

96
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,097
- What really?

97
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:49,136
All right, catch you
on the back nine buddy.

98
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,004
- Yeah over and out.

99
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,807
(dramatic music)

100
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:23,270
- Talk about feeling the
power of the universe.

101
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,541
- Yeah, exciting.

102
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:30,978
- [Stone] You can
find religion up here.

103
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,683
- Not in this space station.

104
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,519
- I don't think there's a
chance of shares of epiphanies.

105
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,254
- You don't think tug boat
pilots have epiphanies

106
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,723
every time they roll into port?

107
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,959
- I guess agency bean
counters aren't big on
epiphanies either,

108
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,528
so I'm just out of luck.

109
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:51,231
- Just as well, you
were selected for your

110
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,401
medical training doctor,
not your illusions.

111
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:59,072
- I have no illusions
about this place, trust me.

112
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,211
- So tell us Bridges, you've
been coming up here what,

113
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:07,648
a year now, so is it
as bad as they say?

114
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,883
- All I know is the
local population

115
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,119
gets their three squares
delivered every month,

116
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,453
along with a medical exam.

117
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,257
- Well Kingsley is gonna give
us a behind the scenes tour,

118
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,260
you should tag along
and learn something.

119
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,963
- We depart 12
hours after docking.

120
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:26,600
Once I unload the supplies,
I'm taking a siesta.

121
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:30,170
- [Stone] Sure, see
no evil, hear no evil.

122
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,774
- Wait until she meets Kingsley.

123
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,576
(dramatic music)

124
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,457
(mechanical whirring)

125
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,125
- [Stone] We're still
maintaining normal gravity?

126
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,095
- Yeah, all the
stations and shuttles

127
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,597
now come with a
gravity regulator.

128
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,566
Kind of knocks the fun
out of space travel.

129
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,335
(dramatic music)

130
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:16,650
- That's it?

131
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,652
You didn't do anything?

132
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,321
- I haven't done anything
in almost a year.

133
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,491
Remember when I said I'm
just a tug boat pilot?

134
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:26,960
(dramatic music)

135
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,796
- Hey, at ease Stone.

136
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,064
Let's make sure the
connection module's secure,

137
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,599
right Bridges.

138
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,466
- We're secure.

139
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:47,047
- I have to confess,
I'm not a big fan

140
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,982
of these connecting modules.

141
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,318
- Yeah, you get severe
anxiety every time

142
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,786
you walk through one.

143
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,222
I read your chart.

144
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,791
- You gonna vomit,
don't vomit on my boat.

145
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,295
Oh and one other
thing, no running.

146
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,764
- Why?

147
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,866
- Well you might puncture it.

148
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,301
(electronic beeping)

149
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,336
- After you.

150
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,534
- Wow you made it.

151
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,739
- Just open the damn hatch.

152
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:51,644
- [Bridges] Kingsley.

153
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:52,512
- Bridges.

154
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,119
And you must be Dr. Stone.

155
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:03,290
Welcome, whoops. (laughs)

156
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:08,028
So this is the hammer,
security is fully automated,

157
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,431
so staff contact is
kept to a minimum.

158
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,767
All interrogations
are carried out

159
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,869
from the bridge via speaker.

160
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,106
The prisoners are given food
packages and water once a day,

161
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,509
and change of clothes and
hygiene supplies once a week.

162
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,743
- Once a week?

163
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,512
- They're terrorist doctor.

164
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,314
Each and every one of them
is in the Hall Of Fame.

165
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,282
One of them brought
down Big Ben.

166
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,551
They're lucky we
don't execute them.

167
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,387
- They never leave their cells?

168
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,124
- Oh yes, well to
the examination room.

169
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,159
- So they have no actual contact

170
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,160
with any of the other staff?

171
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,029
- Well there is no other staff.

172
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,998
They're all worldless in
that box and I am the keeper.

173
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,935
- We used to have three
other guys on rotation

174
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,302
but they left early.

175
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,271
Internal friction,
wasn't it Kingsley?

176
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,674
- And the program
is better off for it.

177
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,010
And it mitigates risk.

178
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,478
- Well that's open to debate.

179
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,980
- No, not really.

180
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,281
I'm the one that came
up with the program

181
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,316
and I am the one that
has most experience

182
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,952
of handling vermin like this.

183
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06,954
- How long have
you been up here?

184
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,756
- Well since the program was
approved, five years ago.

185
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,224
- The zone?

186
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,060
- Bridges please, please.

187
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,262
- Going on three.

188
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,665
- Look at how long the 9/11
terrorists were interrogated

189
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,667
and how little they gave up.

190
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,402
And they were suicide junkies.

191
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,873
This are six top members
of the Wolf Pack.

192
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,508
It's not like they're gonna
reveal everything they know.

193
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,110
- Look all we care about, is who

194
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,345
their leader is and where he is.

195
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,481
- Yes, yes, yes,
Alpha, Alpha, Alpha.

196
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:37,217
I'm working on it, one
layer of skin at a time.

197
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,019
- [Bridges] I'll go
unload the supplies.

198
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,720
(toy squeaking)

199
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,589
- [Kingsley] Don't touch
my, don't touch my stuff.

200
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,756
- [Bridges] Be careful.

201
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,726
- Let's get going.

202
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,029
Where can I conduct
my examinations?

203
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:49,897
- Follow me.

204
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,140
(mechanical whirring)

205
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,842
The facility's operated
by key card only,

206
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,444
so don't find
yourselves this part

207
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,080
of the station without one.

208
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:10,850
Don't worry, I'll be
with you all the time.

209
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:13,153
- Long as you let me do my job.

210
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,521
- Yes of course.

211
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,256
There's only one restriction,
that I insist upon.

212
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:19,059
That is that you do not
reveal anything about

213
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,461
the station to the prisoners.

214
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,296
- What would I reveal?

215
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,966
- Oh like there's other
prisoners for example.

216
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,734
- Does the Geneva
Convention allow that?

217
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,469
- The Geneva Convention
doesn't apply in space.

218
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,171
- But what about human decency?

219
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,372
- It's a black site Stone.

220
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,840
- You can't get good
intel if your prisoners

221
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,375
are mentally unstable.

222
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,311
- Well they were mentally
unstable when I got them.

223
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,282
- Give us the grand tour later,
I want to see the prisoners.

224
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,783
- [Kingsley] Yes,
yes, of course.

225
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,654
I'll see you on the bridge
later when we're done here.

226
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,090
This way please.

227
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,069
(man groaning)

228
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,707
- [Bridges] So,
Stone's your ringer.

229
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,512
- Are you serious?

230
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,915
That girl hates my guts.

231
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,251
- [Bridges] Yeah probably
only half as much as she hates

232
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,120
Kingsley's guts by now.

233
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,088
That's why you
brought her right?

234
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,257
You want her to trash
this place in the report,

235
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,691
help you shut it down.

236
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,460
- Why would the agency
want to do that Bridges?

237
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,963
- Well this program
supported by all the nations

238
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,166
to help bring these
animals to justice.

239
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,535
Where else in the
world do we work

240
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,170
hand in hand with our enemies?

241
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,704
- I don't know, I
never been a spook.

242
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:16,343
- Oh yeah I forgot, you're
just the tug boat pilot.

243
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,819
- [Stone] This is
the examination room?

244
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,588
- [Kingsley]
Mm-hmm(affirmative).

245
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,723
- Looks more like
a torture room.

246
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:34,494
- Well it's a mixed use space.

247
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,665
- Well I'd like to
start using it now.

248
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:44,037
- Okay, just remember,
these men were all

249
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,938
in different countries
when they were captured.

250
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,675
And from that moment they've
had black hoods on their heads.

251
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,644
Up until they were locked
in their cells here.

252
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,081
So for five years,
their entire world has

253
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,050
consisted of their
cells and this room.

254
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:00,820
That's all they know, so let's
keep it that way, all right?

255
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,523
(ominous music)

256
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:36,789
And this, my sweet lady,
is the infamous, Argun.

257
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:40,927
- Hello Argun, I'm Dr. Stone.

258
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,630
(ominous music)

259
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,567
- Yeah, yeah, he knows the
drill, he knows the drill.

260
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,638
- Well you can step outside now.

261
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,473
- (chuckles) Like hell I will.

262
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:56,243
- Oh come on Kingsley,
I'm sure your hammer

263
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,679
can handle two people
in a windowless room.

264
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,382
(dramatic music)

265
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:18,365
- If you do or say or
even thought of this room,

266
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:22,702
I'll make sure that
you scream so loudly

267
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,672
that the whole world
will hear you, okay?

268
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,541
I'm just gonna be outside.

269
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:31,278
Enjoy yourself.

270
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,236
- What if he tries something?

271
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:00,440
- With his hands
cuffed behind his back?

272
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,942
The guy who tortures you every
day just outside the door?

273
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,511
Oh and in space.

274
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,713
- Well if I were desperate
enough, that wouldn't stop me.

275
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,949
- [Reiser] All right
so let's play it out,

276
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,785
Stone's your hostage,
who do you negotiate

277
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,855
with on a black site 250
miles above the earth?

278
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,159
- [Bridges] Kingsley.

279
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,060
- Exactly.

280
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,866
Anyway, we all signed
expendables clauses
in the contracts.

281
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:32,004
This place gets
overrun, game over.

282
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,707
(ominous music)

283
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,344
- Shit.

284
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,781
- What can you tell me
about your injuries?

285
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,149
- I'm alone here.

286
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,286
There's nothing else to do.

287
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,324
- Well I don't know
if I can help you,

288
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,594
believe me you're not alone.

289
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,297
(ominous music)

290
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,468
- I have a record, of
what he's done to me.

291
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,602
It's in my cell.

292
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,105
I'll give it to you.

293
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,908
I have to get out of this place.

294
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,810
I'm being tortured.

295
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,981
- All right time's up.

296
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,316
- [Stone] No, hey!

297
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,884
(electricity buzzing)
(man groaning)

298
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,885
Hey!

299
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:21,654
(dramatic music)

300
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,995
Why am I here?

301
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,532
Why am I examining these men
if they're here to be tortured?

302
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,767
- Torture?

303
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:35,868
- Don't bullshit me Reiser,

304
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,270
I'm definitely not in the mood.

305
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,771
- [Reiser] What the hell
did she see back there?

306
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,206
- Just the result of an enhanced

307
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,741
interrogation, nothing else.

308
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,577
- I thought you interrogate
from the bridge, via speaker.

309
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,046
- Well all the procedures
on this station

310
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,315
has been approved
by the government,

311
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,916
which is every nation that has

312
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,651
captured one of those prisoners.

313
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,885
- I don't care who it is.

314
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,423
I have documented
burns, cuts, bruises,

315
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,024
not to mention
psychological torture.

316
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,994
This prisoner Argun, is on the
verge of a mental collapse.

317
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,364
- And your report ought
to reflect everything
you mentioned.

318
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,634
- You, we need to
talk, privately.

319
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,968
- I'll prep for departure.

320
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,409
- [Reiser] You want
to explain what

321
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,511
the fuck is going on here?

322
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,812
(voice trailing off)

323
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,814
- I'll be back,
I'm getting my kit.

324
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,490
(suspenseful music)

325
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:53,145
- I'm not here to argue
okay, I'm here to assess.

326
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:55,582
- So what have you
assessed sitting

327
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:56,416
on the bridge so far mate?

328
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,817
- That one layer of skin
at a time

329
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,886
doesn't cut it after five years,

330
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,120
especially now
when you factor in

331
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,255
the cost of keeping
this place functioning.

332
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,757
- You already made up your
mind before you came up here

333
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,559
and that's why you
brought in Dr. Stone.

334
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:09,161
Do you think I've spent
five fucking years up here

335
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,498
just to be shut down for
some political agenda.

336
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,632
- You'll get your say.

337
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,570
- Look Stone's report
will end this program,

338
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:19,472
just as badly as it will end me.

339
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,508
And I will not go down quietly.

340
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,842
You mark my words!

341
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:32,018
(suspenseful music)

342
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,288
- Argun, Argun
it's me, Dr. Stone.

343
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,926
I don't have much time,
do you have the records.

344
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,096
- How can I trust you?

345
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,799
The records, they're all I have.

346
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:50,603
- I need them now
before they see us.

347
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,171
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

348
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,342
(suspenseful music)

349
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:58,277
Trust me.

350
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:04,484
- You said, you
said I'm not alone.

351
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,355
Did you mean that?

352
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,927
(mechanical whirring)

353
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,630
(Stone moaning)

354
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,570
Take me to them!

355
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:24,804
- [Stone] What are
you talking about.

356
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,540
- [Argun] The other prisoners,
I know that's what you meant.

357
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,076
All this hardware and
checkups for one prisoner.

358
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,511
I don't think so.

359
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,245
- I don't know what you mean.

360
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,747
(Stone groaning)

361
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,616
- [Bridges] Alex
this is Bridges,

362
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,485
departure is set for
one hour from now.

363
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:40,753
Anticipate a point
out of uncoupling.

364
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:41,688
- Make sure you
pick up some of that

365
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,355
space junk on the way back.

366
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,058
Chicks love junk.

367
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,094
- No one loves your junk Alex.

368
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,531
- Are we talking
about the same thing.

369
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:56,402
(suspenseful music)
(Stone panting heavily)

370
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,203
- Are they here?

371
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,606
- Fuck off.

372
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:04,577
(suspenseful music)
(Stone groaning)

373
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,660
- [Bald Prisoner] Are
we in heaven brother?

374
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:23,362
- No brother, but we're
getting out of hell.

375
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,231
Let's go.

376
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,267
(suspenseful music)

377
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,071
- [Bridges] All right,
we're ready to go

378
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,506
whenever you and the doc.

379
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,042
Where's Stone?

380
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:38,745
- [Kingsley] I think she
went to get her med kit.

381
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,980
- [Reiser] Yeah, she
should be back by now.

382
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:44,050
(suspenseful music)

383
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,553
- Shit, shit fuck, fuck!

384
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,254
They're out.

385
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,656
(alarm buzzing)

386
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:50,590
- What do you mean
they're out, all of them?

387
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:51,958
- [Kingsley] Yes all of them.

388
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,425
- [Reiser] Seal them off.

389
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,360
- I have, I've sealed
off the cell block doors.

390
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,828
- [Reiser] Give me a video link.

391
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,063
- [Kingsley] I can't.

392
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,164
- [Reiser] What do
you mean you can't?

393
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,166
- Because the fucking
cameras are malfunctioning.

394
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,400
Because I didn't receive
the fucking parts all right.

395
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,502
- If you hadn't the
whole thing on analog,

396
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,504
we would have known you
needed a fucking part!

397
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:08,007
Jesus Christ, Bridges weapons.

398
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,911
- [Bridges] Here.

399
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,145
- It doesn't have a cartridge,
is there a cartridge?

400
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,447
Kingsley, where are
the fucking cartridges?

401
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:16,382
- [Kingsley] They're
in the power room.

402
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,317
Give me that, let's go, come on.

403
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,352
(suspenseful music)
(alarm buzzing)

404
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,554
Bridges come on!

405
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:26,392
(suspenseful music)
(alarm buzzing)

406
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,296
(suspenseful music)

407
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,463
They should be in there.

408
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:34,500
(suspenseful music)

409
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,270
- Let's go Kingsley, move!

410
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,739
- [Kingsley] I've got it.

411
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,775
(suspenseful music)

412
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,214
- Really, you used all of them.

413
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,117
- Oh yeah, here we go.

414
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,820
(alarm buzzing)

415
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,623
- Let's go!

416
00:25:56,656 --> 00:26:00,259
(suspenseful music)

417
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,329
(prisoner's yelling)

418
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,534
You have nowhere else to go.

419
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,205
Release Dr. Stone and
return to your cells.

420
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,908
(alarm buzzing)

421
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,183
- You guarantee no reprisals?

422
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:26,152
- I guarantee it.

423
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:30,322
- We don't trust you, but
we trust the Americans.

424
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,792
- [Bridges] Where is Dr. Stone?

425
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,961
- In the cell, securamente.

426
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,196
- So go get her.

427
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:40,700
- With pleasure, in exchange
for our interrogator.

428
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,070
And we also guarantee
no reprisals.

429
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,773
(alarm buzzing)

430
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:55,782
(electricity buzzing)
(man groaning)

431
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,285
I got used to it.

432
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,688
(suspenseful music)

433
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,355
Get him!
(men yelling)

434
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:08,094
(men groaning)
(electricity whirring)

435
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:13,132
(suspenseful music)
(men groaning)

436
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,010
- Come on guys.

437
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,713
(suspenseful music)

438
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:27,880
- Kingsley, let's go!

439
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,515
Kingsley, Kingsley!

440
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,019
Get the fuck back!

441
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:36,055
(suspenseful music)

442
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,758
Get the door now, go!

443
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:41,560
(loud banging)

444
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,528
- Stop!

445
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,097
Forget it, we
know where they are.

446
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,700
(loud banging)

447
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:55,641
- [Bridges] You
think that'll hold?

448
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,475
- It better.

449
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,010
- Yeah, so is the
key card again.

450
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,881
- It's all locked.

451
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,716
- [Argun] Is it broken?

452
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,884
- [Prisoner] It's not a concern.

453
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,486
- Bolat, Doku stand guard in
case they try to come out.

454
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,589
We'll split up.

455
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,426
You go with him, see what
you can do to set him arm.

456
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,830
Be careful, we don't know
anything about this place.

457
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:20,399
If you find anymore
crew, kill them.

458
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,236
- What are you thinking,
you went the wrong way?

459
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,974
The bridge, the shuttle
is on the other side.

460
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,108
- Hey you want me
to let you out?

461
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,042
- [Kingsley] Well why didn't you

462
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,310
fall back to the other side?

463
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:32,711
- Because Stone's in
one of these cells.

464
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:33,645
- What?

465
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,814
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,

466
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,348
you took us the
wrong way on purpose.

467
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,416
- I didn't take
you anywhere man.

468
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,452
(suspenseful music)

469
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,490
- We are buggered,
you stupid bitch!

470
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,457
What were you thinking?

471
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,126
- Hey calm down, calm down.

472
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,127
- [Stone] He said that.

473
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,096
- [Kingsley] He said what, what?

474
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,331
- I'm so sorry.

475
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,467
- [Reiser] Sorry is
not gonna cut it Stone.

476
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,536
We ever get outta here ...

477
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,371
- Which won't be easy
thanks to your savior there.

478
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,341
(suspenseful music)

479
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,190
(metal clanging)

480
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,962
- Let me see it.

481
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,172
- I don't need it.

482
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,541
- We all need it.

483
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:50,356
(bones cracking)
(man groaning)

484
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:53,592
That's it, let's
put it in a sling.

485
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,602
- [Reiser] Okay
so mission control

486
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,770
is gonna know
something's wrong when we

487
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,605
don't leave on schedule right?

488
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,340
So how long 'til they send help?

489
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,877
- Soon as the Russians
provide a rocket

490
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,412
and a second shuttle
with enough military

491
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:17,984
to retake the space station,
so don't hold your breath.

492
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:20,186
- So you're just saying,
we should sit here and wait

493
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,453
until they break in and kill us.

494
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,223
- [Bridges] Maybe they'll decide
we have more value as hostages.

495
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,491
- [Kingsley] Oh not Argun.

496
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:26,592
- Not the way their
leader was talking.

497
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,660
What's his name anyway?

498
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,232
- [Kingsley] Argun.

499
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:34,533
- [Bridges] Argun,
isn't that one you said

500
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,035
was practically damaged?

501
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,605
He didn't look too damaged
when he took Kingsley's taser.

502
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,240
- Are you gonna
trust her diagnosis

503
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,009
after everything
that's happened?

504
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:46,512
- Apart from multiple
burns and contusions,

505
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,814
his mental deterioration
stood out to me.

506
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,983
- What's your opinion huh?

507
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,752
You any closer to
breaking than the others?

508
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,454
- [Kingsley] Obviously not.

509
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,223
- [Reiser] Where are you
going with this Bridges?

510
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,457
- [Bridges] Well all
your interrogations

511
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,226
are on record right?

512
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,460
They must show something.

513
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,397
- [Kingsley] He
was breaking down.

514
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:08,734
He was, he was
breaking down, he was.

515
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,770
(suspenseful music)

516
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,274
- No need to amputate.

517
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,475
- Not yet.

518
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,111
Don't worry I'll let
you know when it's time.

519
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,579
- There's no one else on board.

520
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:24,550
I've checked every possible
place, except this one.

521
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,586
(suspenseful music)

522
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:43,970
- Argun, we're in space.

523
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,940
(suspenseful music)

524
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:16,535
- Where did the three
Americans come from?

525
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,271
- A shuttle for sure.

526
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:22,074
- All these years, and
it was us with the Brit.

527
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:25,544
- Each of us alone
with the Brit.

528
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,679
- No matter what
strengthen your heart.

529
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,848
- I know what kept me going.

530
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,952
- We'll settle accounts
with him soon enough.

531
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,388
We're gonna need all
three as hostages anyway.

532
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:38,690
- [Prisoner] Well let's go then.

533
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,260
- First check the area for
anything we can use as a weapon.

534
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,296
(suspenseful music)

535
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,569
(suspenseful music)
(electricity buzzing)

536
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:53,605
(suspenseful music)

537
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,068
- [Bridges] Who
brought 'em in Reiser?

538
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,170
- We did, found him in London.

539
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:27,506
MI6 didn't even
have a fucking clue.

540
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,640
- [Bridges] Who is he?

541
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,079
- The Wolf Pack had a
propaganda in Western Europe.

542
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:36,382
- No, why would the
head of propaganda

543
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,551
in Western Europe immediately
become their leader.

544
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,253
And why would he pretend to be

545
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,955
cracking if he actually wasn't?

546
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,725
(dramatic music)

547
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,428
Come on, we might die up here

548
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,629
because of mistakes
have been made.

549
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,831
We deserve to know
who we're up against.

550
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,434
I mean really up against.

551
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,204
(dramatic music)

552
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,539
He's Alpha isn't he?

553
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,041
Head of the Wolf Pack.

554
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:05,844
(dramatic music)

555
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,885
And you've had him
the whole time.

556
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,655
(dramatic music)

557
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:19,925
- [Kingsley] He's Alpha?

558
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,560
(dramatic music)

559
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,728
He's Alpha.

560
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,531
(dramatic music)

561
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,335
- Yeah, he's Alpha.

562
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,138
(dramatic music)

563
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,118
- [Alex] Mission control to ISS.

564
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:51,957
Mission control to ISS.

565
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,659
(dramatic music)

566
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,628
Mission control to
Bridges, do you copy?

567
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,599
Reentry is now
officially delayed.

568
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,968
If you guys can make it
out of there in the next 10

569
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,371
minutes, we can get you down.

570
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,374
- [Stone] How long
have you known?

571
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,212
- [Reiser] About three
and a half years.

572
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,214
- Three and a half years?

573
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,983
- [Reiser] It was strictly
need to know, all right.

574
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,755
- Who needed to
know more than me?

575
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,491
What the fuck have I been
doing the last three years?

576
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:28,694
- Trying to learn the
whereabouts of Alpha obviously.

577
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,996
But when we found
out who we have,

578
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,799
other priorities
took precedence.

579
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,133
- [Kingsley] Yeah, like
not looking stupid.

580
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:36,435
- That was more than that.

581
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,605
This program allowed us
the type of surveillance

582
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,139
system we could only
dream of before.

583
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,007
Every--

584
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,477
(loud banging)

585
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,713
- Did you think you could
write me off for three

586
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,549
and a half years and
just get away with it?

587
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,084
- It's not like you didn't
have a chance is it?

588
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:54,420
You didn't crack any of 'em.

589
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,321
- Reiser.

590
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,457
- You are not gonna
ruin my reputation.

591
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,526
(suspenseful music)

592
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,394
- [Bridges] Kingsley!

593
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:05,431
(suspenseful music)
(men grunting)

594
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:06,265
Kingsley!

595
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,500
(suspenseful music)

596
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:11,970
(electricity buzzing)
(man yelling)

597
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,408
(suspenseful music)
(man yelling)

598
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:21,447
(loud smacking)
(suspenseful music)

599
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,160
- He just decide
to commit suicide?

600
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,328
A smart guy like that?

601
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,463
Nah, he had a plan.

602
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,065
- [Stone] What do you
think he was trying to do?

603
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,800
- [Bridges] Give a heads
up to Mission Control.

604
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:42,734
That's what I'd do.

605
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,935
- Well obviously the Wolf Pack

606
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,036
have got control of the bridge.

607
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,438
are there any other
coms on board?

608
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:48,206
- Station's guts are
in the power room.

609
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,677
It's gotta have a
basic link right?

610
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,315
- Okay, all we need
now is some weapons

611
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:59,751
'cause that son-of-a-bitch
took the fucking taser!

612
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,620
Shit!

613
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,555
(dramatic music)

614
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,857
- We're gonna need something
to use as a shield.

615
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,460
(man groaning)

616
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:15,467
- So your name is Kingsley.

617
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,976
- Is you Alpha?

618
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,679
It was you, all along.

619
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,753
- Why do you think I
pretend to crumble?

620
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,555
(Kingsley gasping)

621
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,625
So you could focus
your efforts on me,

622
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,126
instead of one of the others.

623
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,563
- Because you don't trust them.

624
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,699
(Kingsley groaning and gasping)

625
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,468
- Because I'm their leader.

626
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,705
- [Prisoner] What are we
going to do with him, eh?

627
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,374
- Any ideas?

628
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,609
- [Prisoner] I have
many ideas. (chuckles)

629
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,411
Five years worth of them.

630
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:04,383
(loud smacking)
(Kingsley groaning)

631
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,591
- Me too.

632
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,025
(Kingsley whimpering)

633
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,995
A lot of them, come from you.

634
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,931
(Kingsley whimpering)

635
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,300
(suspenseful music)
(Kingsley whimpering)

636
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,869
Pull off your fingernails.

637
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:29,341
(bones cracking)
(Kingsley yelling)

638
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:34,446
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

639
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,785
Then insert them all
beneath your eyelids.

640
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:44,490
(bones cracking)
(Kingsley yelling)

641
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:49,528
(Kingsley groaning)
(heavy thudding)

642
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:59,538
- What were you thinking,
running out the way you did?

643
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,475
Do you realize, we're
about to hand you

644
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:05,477
five years of pain.

645
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:13,452
The revenge fantasies I've had,
it's overwhelming.

646
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:18,490
(men yelling)
(loud smacking)

647
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,530
- [Prisoner] Hey
forget the bridge.

648
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,064
- [Prisoner] Yeah.

649
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:31,336
- Forget the bridge,
I spent years

650
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,739
winning the Russian's trust.

651
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,107
Let them recruit me,
sponsor me through
flight school.

652
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:39,911
All along I dreamt of
piloting your fighter bomber

653
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,749
all over Russia, leveling it,

654
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,417
as they did to our lands.

655
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:51,122
But we're here.

656
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,892
(dramatic music)

657
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,496
This was no accident.

658
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,634
We could have died, we
could have anything,

659
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:04,736
but we're here.

660
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:10,709
All the time, all
the pain, that's

661
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:16,448
God, God spared us.

662
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,217
(dramatic music)

663
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,387
God strengthened us
for a better purpose.

664
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,122
A bigger purpose

665
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,092
(dramatic music)

666
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,594
I know why we're still alive.

667
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,899
So we can pilot this ship.

668
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,768
(dramatic music)

669
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,705
- [Bridges] Check in
there, I'll go in here.

670
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,139
- [Reiser] Anything
you can find.

671
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,175
(suspenseful music)

672
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,760
Come on Bridges, let's move.

673
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,796
(suspenseful music)

674
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,604
- [Bridges] Anything?

675
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,906
- I'll let you know
in about five minutes.

676
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,510
- What are you thinking?

677
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,683
- Found a couple of
them in the cells.

678
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,251
- Oh thanks Stone.

679
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,020
(dramatic music)

680
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:35,561
(metal clanging)
(dark ominous music)

681
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,311
(dark ominous music)

682
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,003
- Earlier, some of the things
Kingsley and Reiser said,

683
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,973
Do I owe you?

684
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,275
- I'll let you know
when it's over.

685
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,815
- I want to apologize for
treating you like one of them.

686
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:33,184
I figured an astronaut
must be pretty gung ho.

687
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,319
- Oh I used to be.

688
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,724
Back in my Rogue NASA days,
flight training anyway.

689
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,527
By the time it was my
turn to pilot my own ship,

690
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,764
the government
decommissioned the program.

691
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:48,066
So now I'm a tugboat pilot.

692
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,502
Shuttling dames and
assholes into a black site

693
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,571
prison I couldn't even
tell anyone about.

694
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:59,177
Yeah, that knocked the
gung ho right outta me.

695
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,117
What you got?

696
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,253
- [Reiser] It's not
perfect, but it'll do.

697
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,665
(metal scraping)

698
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,275
- [Bridges] You tell
me the odds Reiser.

699
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,710
- It is six of them
and three of us,

700
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,111
if we don't count Kingsley.

701
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,846
- [Bridges] Yeah, those
aren't the worse odds.

702
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,782
Except for them being
terrorist superstars

703
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,884
and us being a doc,
an analyst, and--

704
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,251
- [Reiser] A tugboat pilot.

705
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,587
- [Bridges] It shouldn't
be too difficult

706
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,122
getting into the power room.

707
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,958
And all we got to do is get
passed those two out there.

708
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:50,628
- Yeah and hold them off
and get the word back.

709
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,330
- [Bridges] Yeah
a piece of cake.

710
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,538
- (fabric ripping)

711
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:03,174
So you learn any special
moves over in Quantico

712
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,143
you can teach us on the fly?

713
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,845
- Nothing you're classified for.

714
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,313
What about you Stone?

715
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,148
You were a squid once?

716
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,917
- Yeah, the only
fight training I had

717
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,518
was 10 years ago in boot camp.

718
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:16,154
I can tell you from my
medical exams on them,

719
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,156
that they've definitely paid a
price for their time up here.

720
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,491
- Old Bolat looked
pretty healthy to me.

721
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:21,760
- [Bridges] Yeah.

722
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:22,894
- They're incredibly
healthy considering

723
00:44:22,928 --> 00:44:24,095
what they've been through.

724
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:25,764
But they all exercise
like fanatics,

725
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,799
and manage to keep
their minds focused.

726
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,968
- [Bridges] Well being a
fanatic will do that to you.

727
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,003
- Still, some things
are unavoidable.

728
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,205
Like loss of bone density,

729
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,441
I'll bet his elbows
snapped like a twig.

730
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:38,710
And the visions impaired to the
excess fluid in their heads.

731
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,545
- You see I was hoping
you were gonna say,

732
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:45,250
they're all dying from cosmic
radiation, but good to know.

733
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:48,186
So who are these
guys anyway Reiser?

734
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:51,923
Be good to know exactly
who we're up against.

735
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:54,292
- Why you want a rundown
of each one of them?

736
00:44:54,325 --> 00:44:55,961
- Well we ain't going anywhere.

737
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:58,229
Neither are they.

738
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:01,266
(dark ominous music)

739
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,339
- [Prisoner] So we can
land the shuttle anywhere?

740
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,841
- Anywhere with a
long enough runway.

741
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,843
- Long enough runway and
friendly enough security.

742
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:14,846
- [Prisoner]
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

743
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,347
- Then why are we still here?

744
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,719
- Because we can do
better than that.

745
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:26,758
We can use the space
station as a missile,

746
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,293
a guided missile.

747
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,495
- But you said it's in orbit
and without a power source.

748
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,530
- We have a power source.

749
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,166
The shuttle, we
knock it out of orbit

750
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,403
by firing the shuttle engines
just before de-coupling.

751
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,441
- It sure will be nice to have
it crash where we want it to.

752
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,314
- Maybe we can convince the Brit

753
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,116
to help us with
the station system.

754
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:58,389
- Okay, so Argun planted
the charges that brought

755
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,125
down Big Ben, killed
all the civilians

756
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:03,161
and cops on the scene,
all while directing

757
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:05,163
operations for the
Wolf Pack. (chuckles)

758
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,899
Well who else they got?

759
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:11,502
- Well there's Idris,
I guess you call him

760
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,204
the intellectual of the bunch.

761
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:15,540
- As opposed to a fighter?

762
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,909
- [Reiser] No they're all
fighters, you got to earn

763
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,544
your stripes in that group.

764
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:20,946
He's Wolf Pack like
the rest of them,

765
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:22,814
but he went to school in Moscow.

766
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:25,516
- [Stone] So he's
intelligent, in what?

767
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,453
- Mathematics, aeronautics.

768
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:31,789
Graduated from the Russian
Federation Flight Academy.

769
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:36,828
- Wait, any mention of a
place called Star City?

770
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,197
- Yeah, why?

771
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:42,333
- Because then he knows
how to fly this shuttle.

772
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,370
(suspenseful music)

773
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:50,041
(prisoners yelling)

774
00:46:50,075 --> 00:46:52,844
(dramatic music)

775
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:07,926
- [Prisoner] Hey.

776
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:08,960
(Kingsley yelling)

777
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,195
- [Prisoner] Hey, hey.

778
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:11,662
- [Kingsley] I'll
fucking kill ya!

779
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:13,965
I'll fucking kill you.

780
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,200
I'll kill you.

781
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:19,004
- You shut up, shut
up, shut up, shut up!

782
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:25,643
So, this station,

783
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,079
it's been a long time since

784
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:30,315
I've practiced on
the dummy version.

785
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:35,353
But I can see it's similar,
so the first question for you.

786
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:41,993
The vestibule, does it still
power the entire station?

787
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:44,729
(Kingsley spitting)

788
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:45,830
(loud smacking)

789
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,766
(Kingsley yelling)

790
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,504
- How long is it gonna take
before Idris can take off?

791
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,739
- He could be gone already.

792
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:55,706
- That is unacceptable.

793
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,175
- Look if you have a
way to reel them back

794
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,443
if they've taken
off I'm all ears.

795
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:00,979
But in the meantime, what do
you say we come up with a plan?

796
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,147
- Don't have time
for a fucking plan.

797
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,481
- What are you talking about?

798
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:04,983
You want us to just
charge out there?

799
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,317
- [Reiser] Do you have any
idea who you helped release?

800
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:07,986
- All right, half the
Dirty Dozen, we get it.

801
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,021
Now if they've
already taken off,

802
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:12,057
we contact Mission Control,
we blow them out of the sky.

803
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,624
- What if something goes wrong,

804
00:48:13,658 --> 00:48:14,625
like it already has.

805
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,794
I'll say it again, the exposure

806
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,397
for the United States
is unacceptable.

807
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,665
- Yeah, but do you
mean the escape

808
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,567
or the fact that you had Alpha

809
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,602
all along and
didn't say anything?

810
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,705
- It doesn't matter what I mean.

811
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:35,580
You coming or am I going alone?

812
00:48:37,182 --> 00:48:39,350
- Kingsley tried the solo act.

813
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:41,786
It didn't work out
too well for him.

814
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,555
We stick together and we
come up with a plan first.

815
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,426
- Like I said, we don't
have time for a plan.

816
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:58,536
(dark ominous music)
(liquid dripping)

817
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,705
- Only one question
left to answer

818
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,607
and you'd rather
cripple the other hand?

819
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,209
You think about it.

820
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:09,981
Just answer the
fucking question!

821
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,251
- All right.

822
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,387
- All right what?

823
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:21,993
- All right I'll answer
about Mission Control.

824
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,195
- Good, good.

825
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:28,066
(suspenseful music)

826
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:42,813
(suspenseful music)
(Kingsley yelling)

827
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,850
(suspenseful music)

828
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:48,919
Now get to work.

829
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:51,022
We're watching you.

830
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,862
It's gonna be easier
than I expected.

831
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,965
All we have to do is use the
shuttle to sort of tugboat.

832
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,569
We'll pull the
station slowly enough

833
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:07,372
into the atmosphere so that
it doesn't burn up in reentry.

834
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,907
- [Argun] How close to
the target do we have

835
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,176
to be before--

836
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,444
- Before we de-couple and watch
the station crash into Moscow.

837
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,579
- Yeah.

838
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:17,248
- I know once we
reenter the atmosphere.

839
00:50:17,282 --> 00:50:19,684
- To get in there,
we'll watch the Brit.

840
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:20,885
I wonder how the
Americans will be

841
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:24,389
when they learn that
their team was on board.

842
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:27,092
- God willing there will
be other missiles

843
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,693
flying after this one.

844
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:31,496
(dramatic music)

845
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,973
- No offense Stone, but
if they zap me and Reiser

846
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:46,010
with those tasers, you're not
gonna stop 'em on your own.

847
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,046
(suspenseful music)

848
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:10,535
- You ready.

849
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,571
(suspenseful music)

850
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:16,874
Let's go.

851
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,910
(suspenseful music)

852
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:28,186
(men grunting)
(electricity buzzing)

853
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:32,089
- You okay, can you move?

854
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:33,758
- I think he had it on 11.

855
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,326
(men grunting)

856
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,262
(suspenseful music)

857
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:38,429
(bones cracking)

858
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,030
(men yelling)
(suspenseful music)

859
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:41,999
Did you get that other bastard?

860
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,368
- [Stone] He got away.

861
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,270
We got ourselves
a bargaining chip.

862
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:48,306
(suspenseful music)

863
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:52,277
- Why the hell did you kill him?

864
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,912
- What difference does it make?

865
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,249
They're not getting out
of here alive anyway.

866
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,085
- Guys, we got no time
for this, let's move.

867
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,389
(men grunting)

868
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:07,425
(suspenseful music)

869
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,900
- I let you down Argun.

870
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,670
- Bolat time was to die.

871
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,876
Like all of us, he did his part.

872
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:29,747
You did what you could.

873
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:33,518
Now you're here, still armed.

874
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:37,355
(dramatic music)

875
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,792
There's only three of them.

876
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,229
And the woman is a
doctor, not a fighter.

877
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,864
We only have to keep
them out of the shuttle.

878
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,767
And these controls.
if the men get close,

879
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,137
overwhelm them and
finish them off.

880
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,906
(dramatic music)

881
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,130
- [Bridges] Ah here we go.

882
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:22,833
(keys clicking)

883
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,001
- [Reiser] It's working?

884
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,469
- [Bridges] Yeah.

885
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,041
Coms.

886
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,744
(keys clicking)

887
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:11,181
(Kingsley whimpering)

888
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,366
- Override is done.

889
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,542
- Mission Control this is
Bridges, do you read me?

890
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,680
Mission Control this is
Bridges, do you read me?

891
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,281
- Where have you been dude?

892
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:45,516
I haven't been able
to reach you for--

893
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,251
- [Bridges] Alex
we have a problem.

894
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,554
- So contact us, that's
what we're here for.

895
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:54,124
Why are you changing all
the reentry coordinates?

896
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:55,926
- I'm not the one
who's changing them.

897
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,596
Wolf Pack has broken out and
taken control of the hammer.

898
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,164
One for them knows how
to fly the shuttle.

899
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:02,400
- Holy shit.

900
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,968
- [Bridges] You better
get the officer on duty.

901
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:05,636
- No kidding.

902
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,673
(suspenseful music)

903
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,276
(suspenseful music)
(prisoner laughing)

904
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,813
(prisoner screaming)

905
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:18,583
- [Idris] Wolf Pack shuttle
to Wolf Pack station.

906
00:55:18,616 --> 00:55:21,051
Wolf Pack shuttle to
Wolf Pack space station.

907
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:23,654
All systems a go.

908
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:27,458
(prisoners cheering)

909
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:30,495
(suspenseful music)

910
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,102
- Bridges, I'm
Commander Hemmings.

911
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:39,570
Bridges what's going on?

912
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:41,639
- The Wolf Pack has taken
control of the space station.

913
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,474
- How that even possible?

914
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,342
Where are you calling
from the shuttle?

915
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:47,612
- A link in the
station power room.

916
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:50,080
It appears they control
the shuttle too.

917
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:52,049
- [Hemings] All
right hang tight.

918
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,085
(suspenseful music)

919
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,392
- Why are the
communications back on?

920
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:03,027
- It's on a cycle.

921
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,328
- Turn it off again.

922
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,331
(suspenseful music)

923
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,199
- Your initial orders
are to hold tight

924
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:10,835
until further instruction.

925
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,738
(suspenseful music)

926
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:17,207
- Fuck, fuck they cut
the link from the bridge.

927
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,909
- Shit.

928
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,945
(suspenseful music)

929
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,580
- We lost it.

930
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:23,648
- [Hemmings] Try to
raise them again,

931
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,816
but first disable the shuttle.

932
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,619
(engine roaring)

933
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,163
- What the hell was that?

934
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:40,665
- The shuttle's
engine starting.

935
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,867
- Are they taking off already?

936
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,135
- No, I think
we're still attached.

937
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:46,437
- [Idris] What?

938
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:48,706
- Too late.

939
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,742
(suspenseful music)

940
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,278
I've got to make some calls.

941
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,314
(suspenseful music)

942
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:05,355
- We've got to move.

943
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,257
- And do what

944
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:08,759
- Stop whatever it
is they're up to.

945
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:10,661
- Look we haven't reached
the kamikaze stage just yet,

946
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,697
at least I've not.

947
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,465
- Listen Bridges, you
got a better idea?

948
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:15,966
Now would be the time to say it.

949
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,503
- Kingsley's still alive.

950
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:21,572
If we can free him, with
can learn a whole lot more.

951
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,140
- You see that's more like it.

952
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,076
And if we find their
key man we take him out?

953
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,678
- Argun?

954
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:29,580
- No, Idris.

955
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:32,617
(suspenseful music)

956
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,999
- I've programmed the reentry.

957
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,136
It's optimized for
speed, so we're gonna

958
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:54,471
sweat a little once we're
back in the atmosphere.

959
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:56,440
- Small price.

960
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:01,011
When do we cut the station
lose and let it fall on Moscow?

961
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:02,246
- 74 minutes.

962
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,715
- [Prisoner] Intruders!

963
00:58:04,749 --> 00:58:07,317
- Go back to the
shuttle, go, go!

964
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:09,820
(people yelling)

965
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:14,859
(suspenseful music)
(fighters grunting)

966
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,405
- Come on Kingsley.

967
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:34,612
(flesh tearing)
(metal clanking)

968
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:39,650
(suspenseful music)
(men grunting)

969
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:51,596
- American, you're going to
die more slowly than the Brit.

970
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,041
- [Bridges] Come on, come on.

971
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,910
- [Prisoner] American!

972
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:11,782
(suspenseful music)
(prisoner grunting)

973
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:30,601
(suspenseful music)

974
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:46,851
(suspenseful music)
(men grunting)

975
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:45,843
(flesh tearing)
(blood pouring)

976
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,879
(suspenseful music)

977
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:56,954
- The station, Moscow.

978
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,156
- [Stone] They're
flying to Moscow?

979
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,962
- [Kingsley] Into
Moscow, With the station.

980
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,964
- How could they fly
the station into Moscow?

981
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,165
- By leaving it
attached to the shuttle.

982
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,767
Did they initiate reentry?

983
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,502
Kingsley!

984
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:15,172
(Kingsley gasping)

985
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:16,506
Kingsley!

986
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,209
(ominous music)

987
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:32,857
- [Reiser] Wolf Pack!

988
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,893
(suspenseful music)

989
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:39,263
Wolf Pack!

990
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,367
(suspenseful music)

991
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,036
Aye, you see this?

992
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,039
This is what I'm gonna
do to your brother.

993
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:52,209
(suspenseful music)

994
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:55,212
(blood squirting)

995
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,081
Don't fuck with America!

996
01:01:57,114 --> 01:01:58,282
- [Prisoner] You are dead!

997
01:01:58,315 --> 01:01:59,349
- Evan stand down.

998
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,951
(men yelling)

999
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:03,988
(suspenseful music)

1000
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,059
(men yelling)

1001
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:13,330
(flesh tearing)
(metal clanking)

1002
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:18,368
(suspenseful music)
(Reiser grunting)

1003
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:30,580
(Stone whimpering)

1004
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:34,518
(suspenseful music)

1005
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,356
- That ought to piss 'em off.

1006
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:42,392
(suspenseful music)

1007
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,788
Hey Stone you wanna
take a look at that cut?

1008
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:21,832
What ever happened to the
Hippocratic Oath doctor?

1009
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,001
Huh?

1010
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,072
(dramatic music)

1011
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:35,079
You want to know what's at risk,

1012
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,081
if this space
station hits Moscow?

1013
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:39,716
- World War III.

1014
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:49,293
Best case scenario, they shoot
this station outta the sky.

1015
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,629
And the US gets the
blame for all of it.

1016
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,098
I swore an oath,

1017
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:56,733
that neither of those
things would ever happen.

1018
01:03:56,766 --> 01:04:00,070
- What you swore an oath
against bad publicity?

1019
01:04:00,104 --> 01:04:01,972
- Look you brought me up
here as a whistle blower.

1020
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:03,140
I get that now.

1021
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,109
But why would the
program want to do that?

1022
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,144
- International security
apparatus we wanted

1023
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:10,247
has been established,
financed equally

1024
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,749
by all the governments for once.

1025
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,684
All that could happen
now is someone find out

1026
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:16,820
that Argun was Alpha.

1027
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:20,224
It could have been Kingsley.

1028
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:21,458
It could have been
one of their partners

1029
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:24,161
on the ground with
intel that they had.

1030
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,163
So we shut this
thing down for cause

1031
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:29,133
and we bury those six fuckers
under the runway when we land.

1032
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:31,335
- Remember you brought
a whistle blower along.

1033
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,038
- Yeah I remember.

1034
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,340
- In the meantime,
clock's ticking

1035
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:39,076
this thing is headed
straight for Moscow.

1036
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:41,711
So let's get back on point huh?

1037
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:43,580
(suspenseful music)

1038
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,515
- [Man In Suit] Anything
more from Reiser?

1039
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:46,716
- [Hemmings] Nothing.

1040
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,920
- I hope those bastards slit
the cocky American's throat.

1041
01:04:49,954 --> 01:04:51,221
- We don't have
any reason to think

1042
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:52,889
he's responsible
for what happened.

1043
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,624
- I don't have any
reason to not think

1044
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,293
he's responsible either.

1045
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,495
- Responsibility obviously
lies with Kingsley.

1046
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:00,597
- Now you're just picking sides.

1047
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,199
- Who's in charge out there?

1048
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,001
- [Man In Suit]
Where is the thing?

1049
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,435
- We can't reach him.

1050
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,171
He may be out for the evening.

1051
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:08,338
- Fucking French.

1052
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:11,108
(dramatic music)

1053
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,914
- It doesn't matter
we have a quorum.

1054
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,549
I see two questions that
need to be answered.

1055
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,219
One, what are we
gonna do about this?

1056
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,821
And two, who gets the blame?

1057
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,959
- I know what we do about it.

1058
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:31,161
- And I know who gets the blame.

1059
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:33,930
(dramatic music)

1060
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:41,071
- [Reiser] How long
do you think we've got

1061
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:42,639
until it's too late
to do anything?

1062
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,641
- [Bridges] It
depends, based on when

1063
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,144
we felt the engine kick
in, a controlled reentry

1064
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:50,147
can have us back in
Moscow in say 60 minutes.

1065
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,017
- 60 minutes, I
can work with that.

1066
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,818
- Yeah but taken into
account that Idris

1067
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:56,953
is flying the shuttle,
it could be sooner.

1068
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:58,688
- And it could be later.

1069
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:00,590
Stay positive.

1070
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:04,028
- Either way, we're aboard
a bomb headed for the earth.

1071
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:05,529
- [Bridges] Yeah that's right.

1072
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,297
- [Stone] And they know that.

1073
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,266
What if you offered to
take everyone down safely.

1074
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,737
- Come on Stone, these
are world class fanatics.

1075
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:15,905
They want to see the world burn.

1076
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,374
- [Stone] I'm sure they
want to live through it.

1077
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:18,208
- [Bridges] It's
not going to work.

1078
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:19,476
- [Stone] Why not?

1079
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:21,178
- 'Cause those guys are
not afraid to die Stone.

1080
01:06:21,211 --> 01:06:24,281
- Well I don't plan on sitting
around and waiting to die.

1081
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,819
Don't you think it might be
at least worth running it
past them

1082
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:31,788
before we all go charging
in there head first?

1083
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,357
- Well good luck Teddy Ruxpin.

1084
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:34,691
Maybe they'll give you
the torture records

1085
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,026
they promised you as well.

1086
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,630
- You're welcome to try.

1087
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,667
(suspenseful music)

1088
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:55,979
- Argun!

1089
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,048
(suspenseful music)

1090
01:06:58,082 --> 01:06:58,915
Argun!

1091
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:01,618
Argun I wanna talk!

1092
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:04,654
(suspenseful music)

1093
01:07:14,198 --> 01:07:15,765
We know what your plan is.

1094
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,136
And you must know there's
no way to survive it.

1095
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,871
So we want to propose a truce.

1096
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,675
Bridges can land us all
safely and no one has to die.

1097
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,811
- And what happens to us then?

1098
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,479
You will slit our throats.

1099
01:07:29,513 --> 01:07:33,016
- You'll be in a better
position than you are now.

1100
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,819
(dramatic music)

1101
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:39,156
- How do I know
this is not a trick.

1102
01:07:39,189 --> 01:07:41,725
- Because I took a big risk
coming to your cell.

1103
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:44,128
- [Argun] Yes you did, and I'm
sure your friends regret it.

1104
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:47,931
Why should I trust them?

1105
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:50,367
- Because they
don't want to die.

1106
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,901
And once we're on the ground,

1107
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:54,504
no one's gonna keep me quiet
about what went on up here.

1108
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:59,476
- Send your pilot over here
before I change my mind.

1109
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,178
- How do I know
you won't kill him?

1110
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,013
- You're just going
to have to trust me.

1111
01:08:04,047 --> 01:08:05,315
(dramatic music)

1112
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:06,350
- What are you gonna accomplish

1113
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,017
by crashing us into Moscow?

1114
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,019
Or into the middle of the
ocean if the wind shifts?

1115
01:08:10,053 --> 01:08:12,222
Countless innocent
people could die

1116
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:14,023
and no one would ever
know you were up here.

1117
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:17,361
Isn't there more to be
gained by shining a light

1118
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:20,230
on what was going on
up here in the dark?

1119
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:23,567
Think about it,
once we tear the lid

1120
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,335
off this program,
you'll have a chance

1121
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:27,204
to make a case to
the whole world.

1122
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:29,306
Tell them the injustice
you've endured.

1123
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:36,045
- You're just trying to
help yourself Dr. Stone.

1124
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:39,015
You're credit to your
country, to humanism,

1125
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,985
very idealistic
and very Rational.

1126
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:45,054
That is a powerful combination.

1127
01:08:45,088 --> 01:08:48,425
And yet, all you
propose that we agree

1128
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,995
that nothing is more
important than staying alive.

1129
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:54,264
Which you can think
about it rationally.

1130
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:56,400
It's no different than
the way of wildest beast,

1131
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:58,968
or the lowest insect functions.

1132
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:01,938
We believe in
something Dr. Stone.

1133
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,740
Something greater
than eating sushi,

1134
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,642
drinking vodka, and
driving electric cars

1135
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:07,544
that would feed a
village in Africa.

1136
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,313
We were willing to die for it,

1137
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:10,914
willing to kill for it.

1138
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:13,250
I don't know what that
makes us either than martyrs

1139
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:16,720
but I do know it
ranks us above you animals.

1140
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:19,523
(dramatic music)

1141
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,013
- Yeah, way to go Stone.

1142
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,950
You know for a minute there,
I thought you had him.

1143
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,253
- [Bridges] You got
a better idea Reiser?

1144
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:51,288
I'm all ears.

1145
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:55,625
- You know Argun
had a point though.

1146
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,361
It's dog eat dog now.

1147
01:09:57,394 --> 01:10:00,163
(dramatic music)

1148
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,967
- I'm not exactly rising
to the occasion am I?

1149
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,969
- You're rising to the
occasion just fine.

1150
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:08,405
If anything, you are lethal
with those foam pads.

1151
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:10,307
- Are you making fun of me?

1152
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,641
- Not at all.

1153
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,410
I saw the way you
pounced on that asshole.

1154
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:17,013
Look, it's now two
of them, three of us,

1155
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,182
and we couldn't have
done that without you.

1156
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,084
You're a tough woman,
you don't forget that.

1157
01:10:21,117 --> 01:10:22,686
- Yeah enough of the pep talk.

1158
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,421
We're running out of time.

1159
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:27,223
(dramatic music)

1160
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,401
- They're animals.

1161
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:40,003
- Yes they are, but knowing
that doesn't help us.

1162
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:44,508
They're desperate
and they're afraid

1163
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,510
because they don't want to die.

1164
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:47,944
Our task is simple.

1165
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,680
Keep them out of the
shuttle for 30 more minutes.

1166
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,982
Victory brings all
the revenge we need.

1167
01:10:57,186 --> 01:10:59,656
(doors slamming)

1168
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:00,890
- What the hell was that?

1169
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,759
- They just locked
all the cell doors.

1170
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,795
- [Reiser] Fuck you Kingsley!

1171
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,864
Even after death you find a way

1172
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,966
to fucking complicate my life.

1173
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,335
- All right back to plan one.

1174
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:14,704
Stone tried diplomacy,
you have managed

1175
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:16,473
to stab or slit your way through

1176
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,107
all of our bargaining chips.

1177
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,843
They have a projectile taser,

1178
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:21,578
we've got no access
to phone now.

1179
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,513
How do we not let that sink us?

1180
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:25,915
(dramatic music)

1181
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,417
- By making sure
it's me who gets hit.

1182
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:30,219
(dramatic music)

1183
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:34,624
it gives you guys a chance
to gut those bastards.

1184
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:35,625
I owe you.

1185
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:39,228
- I like it.

1186
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:42,165
- All right, Stone
takes one for the team,

1187
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,067
you and I rush him.

1188
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,636
- You sure you can handle it?

1189
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:49,806
(dramatic music)

1190
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,508
She's sure about it.

1191
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,780
- I think I can make
something to give us an edge.

1192
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,583
(dramatic music)

1193
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,613
- When they come through, make
sure you have a clear shot.

1194
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,517
- Easy.

1195
01:12:34,451 --> 01:12:36,853
(suspenseful music)

1196
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,788
- Who's in charge of security?

1197
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:41,024
Who designed the security?

1198
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:43,427
Your Mr. Kingsley.

1199
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,962
Well that is exactly where
I'm placing the blame.

1200
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,432
A mass breakout should
have been impossible.

1201
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:50,033
Now what do we do
about the situation?

1202
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:52,936
- Sending a commando team,
is too expensive.

1203
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54,571
(phone ringing)

1204
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:55,605
- Hemmings.

1205
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:58,708
(dark ominous music)

1206
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,647
Hang tight while
I share the news.

1207
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,882
They've rerouted the shuttle,

1208
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,917
it's heading
straight for Moscow.

1209
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:10,454
As of now the space
station is still attached.

1210
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:13,823
- Good Lord the station and
shuttle will erase the city.

1211
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:15,625
- It's a distinct possibility.

1212
01:13:15,659 --> 01:13:18,261
- Then we blow them up
out the sky right now.

1213
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:24,501
(booming explosions)

1214
01:13:27,971 --> 01:13:29,706
(upbeat music)

1215
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:32,809
- They never taught you how to
make urine bombs in the corp?

1216
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:34,511
- Devil Dogs don't
fuck with piss.

1217
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:37,313
- [Bridges] Yeah well, this
is my science fair project.

1218
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:39,616
Different strokes for
different folks huh?

1219
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,718
- [Stone] Did you win?

1220
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:42,652
- [Bridges] Well
the whole process

1221
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:44,788
took a few weeks back in Iowa.

1222
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:47,090
Thanks to modern
technology and the effects

1223
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:50,026
of deep space, we're good to go.

1224
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,195
- So how much of a
bang are we expecting

1225
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,130
one of these things
to give off anyway?

1226
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:56,633
- Well considering we
jerry rigged a blasting cap

1227
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,535
using substitute
minerals, we'll be lucky

1228
01:13:58,568 --> 01:14:00,169
if one of them goes off.

1229
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:02,171
(dramatic music)

1230
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:03,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1231
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,074
It's a shake and bake process.

1232
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:07,811

Ready?

1235
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:35,404
Bridges, Why'd
you get the shield?

1236
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:38,942
- Because he's the pilot.

1237
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,145

1248
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:49,178
Can you feel it?

1249
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,780
We're moments away!

1250
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:53,516

1251
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,819

(suspenseful music)

1271
01:17:46,595 --> 01:17:48,564

01:21:15,738 --> 01:21:19,575
- What have you
got there doctor?

1293
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:23,079
You gonna kill me? (chuckles)

1294
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:25,414
You ain't gonna do shit.

1295
01:21:25,448 --> 01:21:28,484

(men groaning)

1299
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,344
I can't be stopped.

1300
01:21:56,379 --> 01:21:57,613
Know who I am?

1301
01:21:57,646 --> 01:22:00,449
You don't have it in you.

1302
01:22:00,483 --> 01:22:03,019
(men groaning)

1303
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:09,993

01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:13,429
(men groaning)
(loud smacking)

1305
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,830

(alarm buzzing)

1308
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:39,222

(alarm buzzing)

1310
01:22:46,129 --> 01:22:48,431
- Oh we're about to hit the
atmosphere at the wrong angle.

1311
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:49,765
- Which means?

1312
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,334
- You can try, very quickly.

1313
01:22:51,934 --> 01:22:52,901
- So cut 'em loose.

1314
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:54,370
- It's too far down for
a standard uncoupling.

1315
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:56,072
It's just too big if the
station hits the city.

1316
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:58,641
I'm gonna have to
reverse direction,

1317
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,476
bring 'em up to
speed to maximum,

1318
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:02,511
and then uncouple.

1319
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:03,646
If everything works out--

1320
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:04,347
- That's fine just do it.

1321
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:05,914

1322
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:07,983
(alarm buzzing)

1323
01:23:08,017 --> 01:23:11,020
(suspenseful music)

1324
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,126

1325
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,163
(suspenseful music)

1326
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:25,668
- I'm burning up.

1327
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,703
- When I uncouple,
it's gonna get hotter.

1328
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:32,741
Get ready, three. (groaning)

1329
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:34,877
Two!

1330
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:38,781

1331
01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:41,484
(alarm buzzing)

1332
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:45,121
(dramatic music)

1333
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:05,007
(booming explosions)

1334
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:10,045
(alarm buzzing)
(loud groaning)

1335
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:22,225
(dramatic music)

1336
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:29,398
(alarm buzzing)
(loud groaning)

1337
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:41,043
Yeah!

1338
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:41,910
Whoo!

1339
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:47,250
- We're okay?

1340
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,017
We made it.

1341
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:55,324
- Mission Control,
this is Bridges.

1342
01:24:55,358 --> 01:24:59,695
- (chuckles) Bridges,
the Russians said
it was a direct hit.

1343
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,964
Man are they full of shit.

1344
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:06,001
- [Bridges] Requesting
permission to renter.

1345
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:07,870
- [Alex] Of course,
permission granted.

1346
01:25:07,903 --> 01:25:09,638
Man you've got to come in.

1347
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,879
- The missile took
out the space station.

1348
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:20,316
And it seems two of
the Americans arrived
on the shuttle.

1349
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:21,850
- Was it Reiser?

1350
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:23,619
- [Hemmings] Not Reiser.

1351
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:24,487
- Hmm.

1352
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:29,325
(dramatic music)

1353
01:25:32,595 --> 01:25:36,465
- See, I told you
you were tough.

1354
01:25:39,034 --> 01:25:41,003
Engaging auto-pilot.

1355
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,707
(dramatic music)
