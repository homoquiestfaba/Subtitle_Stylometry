1
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,686
So did Mom show you the pictures?

2
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,627
Yeah, yeah. She got a little emotional.

3
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,894
Well, if she had it her way,
Mom would have me live at home forever.

4
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:33,129
Well, at least you'd save
on the rent money.

5
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,897
Hey, do you wanna see my apartment?

6
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,064
I can give you a tour
through the computer.

7
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,302
- What do you mean?
- Okay. Watch. Hold on.

8
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,145
- All right so, this is my living room.
- Oh, nice.

9
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:52,222
- And then this is my balcony right here.
- It makes it nice and bright.

10
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,953
Yeah. All right. And then
this is my dining area...

11
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,325
- Okay.
- ...Slash dancing area.

12
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,262
- It's big!
- Yeah.

13
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:10,032
- This is my kitchen here.
- Nice. Even though you'll never use it.

14
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,834
Hey, I can cook a little bit.

15
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,410
Oh, your mom's worried
you're gonna starve to death.

16
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,875
Yeah, well, I'm not going to.

17
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:20,344
- Wait, Emma, you're frozen.
- Can you see me?

18
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,256
Heh, heh, you should see your face.
Okay, okay.

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,016
- Is it good?
- There. You're back.

20
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:33,255
- All right, this is the bedroom over here.
- Mm. Nice.

21
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,730
- It's still, like, super messy.
- You and your mom did good.

22
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,564
I know. Oh, wait, I wanna show you
one more thing.

23
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,035
Hold on one second.

24
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,902
What's up there?

25
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,137
This is like a little storage unit...

26
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,943
or it could be used
for really small peep...

27
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,532
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. Why are you out of breath?

28
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,902
Just doing a little ballet.
Just messing around.

29
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,602
- Oh, you're gonna start dancing again?
- I am so bad.

30
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:25,113
Oh, stop. So, what did you do today?

31
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,650
Unpacked the whole day.
I didn't even go outside once.

32
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:34,053
Dude, stop being a homebody
and go out. Go explore, you weirdo.

33
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,626
I know. But I have to get settled first.
You know me and my OCD.

34
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:42,198
- How was last night?
- Well, I ran into Alex at the wrecker.

35
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,357
- Ugh.
- Yep, he was drunk.

36
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,367
He kept saying how you need to get
off your high horse...

37
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,938
and blah, blah, the usual cra...

38
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,551
Here we go.

39
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,252
The next stop is Essex.

40
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:28,234
Holy crap. Holy crap.
Holy crap. Holy crap. Whoo!

41
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,872
Okay, I've always wanted to
walk across this, and here I am.

42
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,118
Per capita GDP is about 7500.

43
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,659
That's very low
given the amount that it exports.

44
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,562
Now, compared to the GDP of the U.S.,
which exports a...

45
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,196
it could add trillions.

46
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,899
I think it's 2.7 trillion to the world
economy, and most of that growth...

47
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,408
- Emma, right?
- Yeah.

48
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,776
Your thoughts on economic extraction,
very interest...

49
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,607
- ...emerging markets, right?
- Yeah.

50
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,611
- Are you a night person too?
- Kind of.

51
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,215
I like to do most of my work
when the sun isn't out.

52
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,183
Mm. Yeah, especially in the city.
So many distractions.

53
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,117
- Heh.
- Um...

54
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,950
- Do you mind if I...?
- No. Yeah, sit.

55
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,821
- Cool. I'm Michael, by the way.
- Emma.

56
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,987
- Are you from New York or...?
- No, I'm actually from the midwest.

57
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,894
- Oh.
- Wisconsin.

58
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,399
- Cool. Good cheese.
- Ha.

59
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,661
- Yeah.
- What?

60
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,397
Nothing. It's just that's what
everybody always says.

61
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,802
- They talk about the cheese.
- Ah.

62
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,841
What about you? Where are you from?

63
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,277
Oh, I'm from Westchester.
It's about an hour north of the city.

64
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,347
But I live here now though.

65
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,076
- I just moved here, so...
- Oh, okay.

66
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,517
- Yeah, like a week ago. Yeah.
- Wow.

67
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:29,990
Jeez, you have so much to see,
and do and to eat.

68
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,595
I should make you a list or something.

69
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,891
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be totally awesome.
- Cool.

70
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,504
Or I could... you know, I could take you
for a cup of coffee sometime.

71
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,334
I know a lot of really good
coffee shops around here.

72
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,676
And what if I don't like coffee?

73
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,704
- Then I can take you to a cheese shop.
- Ha. Nice.

74
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,874
Mm. How about sometime this week?

75
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,453
- Yeah. Sure.
- Cool.

76
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,453
Well, I'll text you. What's your number?

77
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,527
- 608-473-4127.
- Great.

78
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,488
Hello?

79
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,068
Hello?

80
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,472
Alex, I swear to God, if this is you...

81
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,425
Player one. Select your match. Italy.

82
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:15,493
France. England. England.

83
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,545
Strong serve.

84
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,817
Advantage server.

85
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,165
- I got your text. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

86
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,495
I couldn't get out of bed.
Way too hungover.

87
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,501
- Oh, God.
- I almost didn't go to class.

88
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,902
It was actually nice
to wander around by myself.

89
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,442
Except some guy yelled at me for
stopping in the middle of the sidewalk.

90
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,078
I forgot that was a thing here.

91
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,715
Oh, that's not a joke.
People are not playing.

92
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,975
Oh, my God, this guy again.

93
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,053
This is literally the fifth day in a row
he's texted me...

94
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,849
and I've ignored him every time.

95
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,822
- Is that every guy's dream?
- Yes. Thank you.

96
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,861
Would you like to speak with him?
Because that's how I'm feeling it.

97
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,057
But, I don't know, I found the one guy
who doesn't want that.

98
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,601
- Wait, do you have a person?
- No.

99
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,672
I mean, I did. I was seeing someone
back home, but, uh, we broke up.

100
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,071
I just feel like
I needed a fresh start here.

101
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,837
Yeah. Well, you picked the right place.

102
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,708
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

103
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:42,580
Ugh. Speak of the devil, it's Alex, my ex.

104
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,883
Yeah, he's been texting me.
He never really took the breakup so well.

105
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,863
Do you like empanada?

106
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,076
Almost here.

107
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,541
Oh...

108
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,720
Whoa.

109
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,553
This is huge for New York.

110
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,919
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's kind of a trade-off.

111
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,560
I live so far from everything.

112
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,629
- He's really cute.
- I know, right?

113
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,026
He came up to me in the library
out of nowhere.

114
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,759
I knew what he was doing,
but he was pretty funny.

115
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,165
Let's see his other photos.

116
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:39,139
- He has an adorable smile, right?
- Yes, I'm sure that's what she thinks too.

117
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,675
Poor thing.

118
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,911
- Oh. And her too.
- Oh, my God.

119
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,641
- Oh. And her.
- Nicole.

120
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,112
I don't I know if
I should hang out with him.

122
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,620
- I don't know if I'm ready to date yet.
- What?

123
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,527
- You said you wanted a fresh start.
- I do.

124
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:59,289
Well, then you should absolutely
hang out with him.

125
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,763
Hey, do you want English breakfast,
Earl grey or chamomile?

126
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,766
Um... I'll take Earl grey.

127
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,371
Oh, I'm serious.

128
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:25,516
I have no idea.
Just started playing out of nowhere.

129
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,090
Too much porn, girl. That's what you get.

130
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,023
No, but come on, seriously. What was that?

131
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:35,188
I don't know. You should take it to that
tech place by school. They'll look at it.

132
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,096
They'll probably look at it for free,
you're cute.

133
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,398
- Ugh. So annoying.
- You know.

134
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:45,037
- Anything else?
- No, just the pad kee mao, please.

135
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:50,408
- Okay. What's your address?
- It's 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A.

136
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,709
- Should be dropped off in half an hour.
- Thank you.

137
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:03,125
It's 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A.

138
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,422
- Should be dropped off in half an hour.
- Thank you.

139
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,012
Okay, so have the egg ready.

140
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,881
- Okay.
- Now, go back to the pot...

141
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,318
and make sure
you still have the whirlpool.

142
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,050
Okay, then I'm just
gonna put it in, right?

143
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,558
You're gonna slide it in carefully
in the center of the whirlpool.

144
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,060
- That's the only tricky part.
- Okay.

145
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,268
You know, so it, like, nestles in there.

146
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,629
Careful.

147
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,540
- Ugh. It broke again.
- You're hilarious.

148
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,677
You go from not cooking at all
to making really fancy eggs.

149
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,370
Well, you make it look so easy.

150
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,278
I mean, Mom, seriously,
mine looks like egg drop soup.

151
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,214
Do you see that?

152
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,582
Yes, I can.
But don't worry about it, you'll get it.

153
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,916
And have a little patience.

154
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,424
- I'm just gonna make sunny side up.
- Okay.

155
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:55,656
- So you're feeling okay out there?
- Yeah. No, I feel great.

156
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,665
I mean, it's been a bit lonely at times...

157
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,395
but I don't know, I guess I can
focus on myself.

158
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:05,665
Um, and he asked me out for coffee so...

159
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,711
- Where did you meet him?
- We're in the same class at school.

160
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:11,487
Okay.

161
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,518
What's so funny?

162
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,881
Because you're just, like,
overthinking everything.

163
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,556
Let's not get into this agai...

164
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,915
When seeing how sustaining the stimulus

165
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,427
could increase the challenges when
trying to normalize monetary policy.

166
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,692
It can also lead to financial instability
and expose open ec...

167
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,871
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Ha-ha-ha.

168
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,636
- I think I'm gonna switch to coffee.
- Coffee? I thought you didn't like coffee.

169
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,970
Well, I don't love it,
but I need something stronger.

170
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,477
- Do you want another cappuccino?
- I'll get it.

171
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,411
No, no. Let me. You got the last one.

172
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,608
All right. Thanks.

173
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:57,584
- Hi, can I have two cappuccinos?
- Yeah, I'll bring it over.

174
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,165
- He's gonna bring it over.
- Thanks.

175
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,559
So I'm going to this dance party thing
on the lower east side tonight...

176
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,798
- if you wanna come with.
- Oh, that sounds fun. But I have plans.

177
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,069
If your plans fall through
or if you change your mind...

178
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,180
I'm a pretty good dancer, so...

179
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,813
Wow, that was amazing.
They were just so small.

180
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,147
Yeah, I know.

181
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,983
- Such small movements.
- In Ireland, it's a techno...

182
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,253
- In Ireland?
- It's an underground Irelish sect.

183
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,761
- Irelish.
- Yeah. It's English and Irish together.

184
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,695
Oh, that's great. Oh, my gosh.

185
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,799
And they wear electronic kilts and stuff.

186
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,700
- That sounds really weird, but that's...
- Yeah, but it's cool.

187
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,102
- You should definitely check it out.
- So you like to wear skirts?

188
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,404
- They're not skirts.
- They look like skirts.

189
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,047
They're electronic dance blankets.

190
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,838
- Dance blankets? Okay.
- Yeah.

191
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,010
Nice move.

192
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,820
Keep it up.

193
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,939
- Hello?
- I'm looking for Ms. Taylor.

194
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,343
- Emma Taylor, right?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,713
Here you go. I just need you to sign here.

196
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,523
- Thanks, have a good one.
- Thank you.

197
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,392
No.

198
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,537
You didn't sign up for anything?

199
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,401
Sometimes they send stuff from
orientation, welcome gifts or whatever.

200
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,873
No, I mean, there's nothing else
in the box.

201
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,104
There is no letter, no pamphlet, nothing.
Am I crazy?

202
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,273
- Well, it's a free razor.
- Yeah.

203
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,385
Watch me get billed in a couple weeks.

204
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,493
I have to take a picture of this.
This is so funny.

205
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,666
You need to get that hat.

206
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,200
Okay, you're gonna put on this hat.

207
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,497
Here's what my grandmother would take.

208
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,673
- Is that good?
- Oh, so good.

209
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,608
- Room temperature.
- Scale of one to 10.

210
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,374
- 7.3. 8.3.
- 7.3?

211
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,107
- 8.3.
- See?

212
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,275
Now you can go like this.

213
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,511
Can you see my mouth...

214
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,104
Beginner. Interme...

215
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,212
Nice work.

216
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,485
Keep it up.

217
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,132
Hello?

218
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,938
- Hello?
- Hey.

219
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,236
Alex?

220
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,005
Yeah, what,
did you forget my voice already?

221
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,740
Why are you calling me
from a blocked number?

222
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,976
Because you don't answer my calls.

223
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,917
All I wanna do is say hi,
see how New York is.

224
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,150
Okay. I told you I needed space.

225
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,456
Oh, what, I'm smothering you again?
You are unbelievable.

226
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,158
You act like I'm the bad guy. You're
the one who was seeing other people.

227
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:15,362
For the last time, Alex, I wasn't seeing
anyone. And we were on a break.

228
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:21,510
Okay, whatever. I'm over it. I'm just
calling to see how everything's going.

229
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:25,774
Alex, we can't keep doing this.
We can't keep talking like this.

230
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,350
I can't even call you to say hi?
So were we nothing then?

231
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,011
Like we never happened?

232
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:38,490
Look, we've been over this before.
I just need to focus on myself right now.

233
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:42,757
And maybe somewhere down the line
we can be friends...

234
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,561
but for now I just really need my space.

235
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,795
So you move to New York
and just forget everything else?

236
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,998
Okay, fine.
I'll just fucking forget you too.

237
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,506
Have a nice fucking life, Emma.

238
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,775
So mature.

239
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,382
- How's Dad? Is he around?
- No. He'll be back on Friday.

240
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,249
- Oh, right. He's in Chicago, right?
- Yeah, for the conference.

241
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,220
But... oh, honey, you're breaking up.

242
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:17,485
How about you? Feel like a New Yorker?

243
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,129
I'm doing so good. It's so amazing here.

244
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,301
I feel like I have a whole new sense
of freedom.

245
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,428
Oh, and I hung out with that guy,
Michael, yesterday.

246
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,301
We went all over New York.

247
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:34,478
But we didn't do, like, touristy stuff,
so it was really nice.

248
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,806
You sound great, Em.
So happy to see you like this.

249
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,074
It's like the old Emma.

250
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:43,651
Listen, I know I said
you might not be ready for this...

251
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:48,825
and things were a little tense with us
when you left, but I was wrong.

252
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,963
I'm sorry about all that.
I am proud of you.

253
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,157
Oh, Mom. I wanna hug you right now.

254
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,459
I know, me...

255
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:03,437
I wanna hug you right now.
Hug you right now.

256
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:06,405
Hug you... hug you right now.

257
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,814
Stop doing that. You're insane. I can't.

258
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,548
Oh, my God. Alex, what are you doing?

259
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:31,132
Happy birthday, Emma.
It's Emma's birthday.

260
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,805
It's my birthday too.

261
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:49,985
All right.

262
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,384
I just got home,
so I'll call you later, okay?

263
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,588
- Wait, all your photos are gone?
- No, not all of them. Just certain ones.

264
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:03,232
I mean, ones with me and Alex, and
Michael, and I don't know what else.

265
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,492
- Does Alex have your password?
- No.

266
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,864
And he would never do something like this.

267
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,198
I don't know.

268
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,102
- Are you in my photo albums?
- Yeah.

269
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,005
- They're not in there, right?
- No.

270
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,613
Maybe their server
got messed up or something.

271
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,749
You're sure no one else has your password?

272
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,543
No. I'm really careful about that stuff.

273
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,115
- Wait. They just got back to me.
- What'd they say?

274
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,088
Oh, God. I have to change
all of my passwords now.

275
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:37,098
But you know what?
I think I can make an exception for you.

276
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,895
- Just don't tell anyone. Okay?
- Okay.

277
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,538
I really appreciate it.
This thing is, like, my life.

278
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,368
Oh, my God. Of course.
Let's see. Is there anything else?

279
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:48,636
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need
the administrative password...

280
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:54,408
and your social security number,
and that was just a dumb joke.

281
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,553
- I don't know why I said that.
- Okay.

282
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,747
I'm just... yeah, but I'm gonna need
definitely the password.

283
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,119
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.
Let me just write it down.

284
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,592
- Oh, I'm Greg, by the way.
- Oh, yeah. Hi, I'm Emma.

285
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,959
- Emma, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

286
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,125
- And thank you again so much.
- Oh, yeah. It's no problem.

287
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,134
- Should I close that?
- Oh, yeah. If you want to.

288
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,931
Okay.

289
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,473
And it was only, like,
certain photos that were gone.

290
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,238
What was it, then?

291
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,507
I don't know. My laptop was fine though.

292
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,242
There's no viruses or anything...

293
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,614
so I just have to be extra careful
with my passwords now.

294
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,984
That's super sketchy.
I'm changing my passwords too.

295
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,855
- Okay. I'm here. I'll see you later.
- Have fun.

296
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,086
Yeah, definitely.

297
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,927
And with all the grants and everything,
it should be pretty easy to get a job.

298
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,102
I don't know, it's just super fascinating.

299
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,171
I mean, so much is gonna change
in the next 10 to 20 years.

300
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:55,277
- Yeah. Also, robots.
- Ha-ha-ha. Yes. Robots.

301
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,970
Mm-hm.

302
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,380
That's my roommate. He's pretty hilarious.

303
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,448
You should meet him. Kent?

304
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,776
Kent, come in here.

305
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,354
He probably has his headphones in.

306
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,550
Ah! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

307
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,525
I didn't realize that you had company.

308
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,358
- You're an asshole.
- You should've seen your face, though.

309
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,524
It was so sweet. I'm sorry. I'm Kent.
I'm Michael's roommate.

310
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,363
- Emma. Nice to meet you.
- Not cool.

311
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,802
Oh, come on, chill out.
Oh, do you guys go to school together?

312
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:31,812
- Yeah, we're in the same class.
- Oh, economicals. Cool. Very cool.

313
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,343
- Do you go to school?
- No, I'm a bartender.

314
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,885
I actually bartend a few blocks away.
You should come in.

315
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,216
Free shots on me. You can come too.

316
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:45,486
Oh, thank you. That's the first time
you're hooking me up. That's so nice.

317
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,231
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

318
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,831
Yeah. It's right back there.

319
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,332
By the way, I'm going out of town
for a few days...

320
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,164
so you have the place to yourself.

321
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,670
- Dude, what? Who is she?
- That's the chick I told you about, man.

322
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,536
Oh, my God. Tell me you got in there.

323
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:03,235
I'm not. You barging in like a douche bag
doesn't exactly help set the mood.

324
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,381
She's so fucking hot. Please get in there.

325
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,381
Okay, she's gonna hear you.
Chill out. Would you please leave?

326
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,144
Okay. Okay. But you know
where the penis goes, right?

327
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,289
- The penis goes in your mouth.
- The vagina.

328
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,288
It goes in your mouth. Yeah, I do know.

329
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,460
- You need so much help.
- I appreciate that.

330
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,152
I'm probably gonna listen.

331
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:23,062
You guys have been hanging out a lot.

332
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:28,364
I know. I keep telling myself I can't fall
into something. I can't fall into something.

333
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,303
- Maybe just fall into his bed then.
- Oh, gosh.

334
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,604
No, I want to. It's just, I don't know,
I feel like I should wait.

335
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,873
Might be a little bit too soon
after my ex.

336
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,813
But Michael is awesome, right?
And he's so cute.

337
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,781
And he's really funny.

338
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,819
God, again. I keep getting
these weird text messages.

339
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,223
- From who?
- I don't know.

340
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,628
- They're all from a blocked number.
- What does it say?

341
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,497
It says, "you never told me
how you were doing."

342
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,967
I mean, I get weird texts too sometimes...

343
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,767
from people who are, like,
dialing the wrong number.

344
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,575
That's it, that's it, that's it!

345
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,451
Bye bye birdie, he got in four.

346
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,756
Sound on for the home team.

You have four saved messages.
First saved message.

351
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:47,246
Hi, this is Patrick
from financial services.

352
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:50,181
Message skipped. Next message.

353
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,616
Hey, Em. It's Mom.
Give me a call when you can.

354
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,119
I'm planning Thanksgiving...

355
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,816
and I forget what days you have off.
Love you, bye.

356
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,690
Oh, my gosh. He's so cute.
I've wanted a cat for so long.

357
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,889
- You should get one.
- Been thinking about it.

358
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,898
I had two amazing cats growing up.
Winkle and Oreo.

359
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,263
Winkle?

360
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,809
- Love, 15.
- Your noises are really distracting.

361
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,140
I'm sorry. Oh, oh.

362
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,077
Stop.

363
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,519
Eh.

364
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,146
You sound like you're gonna throw up.

365
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,323
I am. Hah!

366
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:31,426
- Stop your noises.
- Strong rally.

367
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,688
Does the more forceful I do it
make it more forceful?

368
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,695
- No.
- I don't wanna throw my shoulder...

369
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:40,098
- Game, set, match.
- Again. Once again. I'm the best.

370
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,431
- Not fair.
- I won again.

371
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,509
I think maybe we should slow down.

372
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,742
I don't want to, but I just...

373
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,717
- I think that we should.
- Yeah. Totally.

374
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,221
There's no need to rush things.

375
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,105
Cute.

376
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:24,402
My dad got it for me when I was little.
It reminds me of home.

377
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,999
Hello?

378
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,354
Hello?

379
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,362
Finding your location.

380
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:34,174
You're near eighth street
and university place.

381
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:38,405
We are looking for someone to lead it,
a grad student.

382
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,243
And I thought of you right away.

383
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,919
Now, it's a great opportunity,
but do not feel obligated.

384
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,387
But if it's something that might
interest you...

385
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,186
I could recommend you to the department.

386
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:55,855
Wow. Wow, thank you. I'm so flattered.

387
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,092
No pressure. If you need some time
to think about it, that's fine.

388
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,795
- Take your time.
- No. Yeah, I'm definitely interested.

389
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:06,600
I just wanna make sure
that I have the proper time.

390
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,607
Yeah, good.

391
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,810
So how are you settling in?

392
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,777
I think he was flirting with me.

393
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,279
- No way.
- No, I'm serious.

394
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,215
He kept telling me to call him Chris.

395
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,551
- Is he cute? How old is he?
- Nicole, come on, he's like 50.

396
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,726
I mean, it sounds like an easy A.

397
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,826
Well, maybe I should introduce you to him.

398
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,894
Maybe you should.
I have a thing for older men.

399
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,625
- Shit, I gotta run. Talk to you later, okay?
- All right. Bye.

400
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,697
You've got to be kidding me.

401
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,037
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

402
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:49,405
I'm so glad that you called, I was just...

403
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:53,377
I'm living with Michael right now
and he just sent me porn.

404
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,609
Whoa, kinky.

405
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:58,651
No, awkward.
He just sent it to me out of nowhere.

406
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,186
Yeah, that's a little weird.

407
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:05,825
- He just told me that I make him nervous.
- What? What does he mean?

408
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,487
I don't even know how to respond to this.

409
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,998
I mean, I'm just saying,
"that's nice of you to say."

410
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,228
Where's he going with all this?

411
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:18,905
- What the hell?
- What? What now?

412
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,576
"I've been wanting to talk to you
for a long time."

413
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:24,577
What is this guy's deal?

414
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,150
- Wait, he just sent me another link.
- Here we go.

415
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,913
Okay, this is getting super weird.

416
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,251
He just sent me a video of me
from high school.

417
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,759
Really? This guy's all over the place.

418
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:43,364
Holy shit, I totally forgot about this.

419
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,968
My mom posted this, like, forever ago.

420
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,364
Why did he send it to you?

421
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:53,069
- I don't know.
- How weird.

422
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:57,873
- I just asked him how he found it.
- Can't wait to hear this.

423
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:05,978
- "You can get anything on the Internet."
- Whoa, okay, creeper alert.

424
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,712
What is he doing?

425
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,755
Why were you sending me weird shit?

426
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,393
Wait, wait, wait, what?

427
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,120
I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm not even online.

428
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,196
Okay, are you serious? Is this a joke?

429
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,389
It's not funny, I was just talking to you.

430
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,126
Okay, first of all, calm down.

431
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:23,772
I haven't touched my computer all night,
so I don't know what's going on.

432
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,203
- Well, then who was it, Michael?
- I don't know.

433
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,206
Are you sure it came from my e-mail?

434
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,107
Yes, the one that we always talk on.

435
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,250
Okay, hold on, I'm checking now.
It wasn't from me, so...

436
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,975
Someone got into my account.

437
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,747
What? No. No, this person
knew stuff about me.

438
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,627
- Whatever, this is so weird, I gotta go.
- Hold on, wait, hold on.

439
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,660
Didn't you get hacked a few days ago?

440
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,923
What if someone hacked into my account...

441
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,102
like, to fuck with you or something?
I don't know.

442
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:57,762
- I gotta go.
- Really? What, you don't believe me...

443
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,963
Hey. Can we talk?

444
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,998
Yeah, no, now's not really a good time.

445
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,193
You know, I changed my password
and everything on my computer.

446
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,896
I might actually get a new one. So...

447
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,336
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

448
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:38,347
Look, I'm not trying to blow you off, it's
just this whole situation is scaring me...

449
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:42,416
and there's just a few things
I have to figure out, okay?

450
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,349
Yeah, totally. All right.

451
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,890
Yo, Felipe, hold up.

452
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,445
Hey.

453
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,792
Be careful about who you meet out there.

454
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,760
You really think it's some rando?

455
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:32,457
I don't know. I changed
my privacy settings on everything.

456
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,261
I'm gonna change my number
when my new phone gets here.

457
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,599
I'm not giving it out to anyone.

458
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:42,710
I mean, don't take this the wrong way,
but you kind of jump into things fast.

459
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,540
- Yeah.
- And Michael could just be another Alex.

460
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,718
I know, but now I feel like
I can't trust anyone.

461
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,875
Did you make sure
your bank account is okay?

462
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,043
Yeah, it's fine.

463
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,349
I called and told them to flag
my account for any weird activity...

464
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:59,551
and I'm gonna install this antivirus
program thing that I bought.

465
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,994
- Fifty dollars down the drain.
- That sucks.

466

Please enter your password.

467
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:41,635
You have one new voice message.
First voice message.

468
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:45,171
Emma, it's Chris Williams.
Haven't heard from you in a while.

469
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,808
Not sure if you got the e-mails
I sent you...

470
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:51,378
but your fellowship interview got
bumped to tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.

471
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:52,844
I'd get there a lit...

472
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,917
Message erased. End of new messages.

473
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:22,034
I just don't know why they're doing it.

474
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,974
Is there anyone you pissed off back home?

475
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,371
I don't think so.

476
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:31,218
No, and if I did piss someone off,
why can't they just say it?

477
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,649
Why are they hiding behind
all this bullshit?

478
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:37,850
Who the hell knows?
Let's just have fun tonight, okay?

479
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:41,656
- We need to get our drink on.
- Yeah, I need to clear my head.

480
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,356
I don't know why I've been
talking about this.

481
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:45,899
Exactly.

482
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,506
How does this look?

483
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,067
Hot.

484
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,478
Okay, you ready?

485
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,591
Can you take a picture of us?

486
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,895
- You girls want a picture?
- Yeah.

487
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,573
All right, say "gorgeous."

488
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,070
- Wait, it's not working.
- Let me see.

489
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,805
Let me put my number in first,
it's the least I can do.

490
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,074
Give me the phone.
I don't want your number.

491
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:40,882
Just so you have it, you know.
You can call me anytime. And done.

492
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,718
- Do not tell me this works on other girls.
- I won't.

493
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,794
Okay, well, we'll call you later
so you have our number too.

494
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,591
Oh, I just deleted your number. Weird.

495
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,393
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

496
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:04,329
Let's eat something. I guess
we're on our way, but we can probably...

497
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,872
- I want a muffin.
- Mm.

498
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,873
A muffin.

499
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,844
I have it all over me. This cab is moving.

500
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,887
- Now it's like an old lady.
- It's moving.

501
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,519
I'll make you look fucking fabulous.

502
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:50,550
I'm gonna do a song for everybody, but...

503
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,232
Your laugh is killing me right now.

504
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,108
Fuck.

505
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:06,026
Two rings, you let down, got that?

506
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,128
One ring up, two rings down.

507
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,799
- One for up, two for down.
- Beautiful.

508
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,798
Glad I got through fifth grade...

509
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:16,131
so I can understand these
very, very complicated procedures.

510
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:25,478
He's not very used to lions.

511
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,376
Good-for-nothings.

512
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:30,484
How about you, my little friend?

513
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,571
Nicole, I just got home
and my door wasn't locked.

514
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,831
I never do that. Should I call the cops?

515
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:35,500
Wait, hold on. Maybe you left it
unlocked in a rush or something?

516
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:39,681
I don't think so. Shit, I don't remember.

517
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:42,110
- Where are you now?
- I'm outside.

518
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:45,583
Okay, take a deep breath.
You wanna just pop your head in?

519
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,313
- I'll stay on the phone.
- Okay.

520
00:50:57,288 --> 00:51:00,929
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

521
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:05,403
- Everything looks fine.
- Okay, that's good.

522
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,274
- You all right?
- I don't know.

523
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,036
Okay, I'm just gonna check
the rest of the apartment.

524
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,875
Okay.

525
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:16,850
God, I probably just left it unlocked.

526
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,220
Does anything feel weird in there?

527
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,456
I'm not sure, I'm still looking around.

528
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,294
Do you want me to just come over?

529
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,165
You sound kind of freaked out,
I feel like I could help.

530
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,941
Hold on one second.

531
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,242
- Just stay with me, okay?
- Okay.

532
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:13,368
Emma? Emma?

533
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:16,773
Emma, are you there? Emma!

534
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,838
- Hey, sorry, I dropped my phone.
- Holy fucking Christ.

535
00:52:21,038 --> 00:52:24,178
Everything's fine, nothing's missing.

536
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,618
You scared the fucking shit out of me.

537
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:32,089
I'm probably just crazy. I just...
I've been so stressed out lately.

538
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,665
Crazy easy, really rich and nice.

539
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,842
Just brush it on, good to go.

540
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:31,978
Second one we're gonna make,
whole-grain mustard, some sage...

541
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,872
and a little bit of rice wine vinegar.

542
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:40,555
Again, maybe one part:
Mustard, one part honey.

543
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:43,154
A teaspoon, tablespoon of rice wi...

544
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,205
Hey.

545
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:09,748
What are you doing here?
I mean, how'd you get up here?

546
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:14,356
Someone let me in,
but I brought you something.

547
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,957
- Is that a cat?
- Is this a cat, what?

548
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,025
No. Maybe.

549
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,522
God, I don't believe you.

550
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,724
- I know it seems crazy...
- Yeah, it is crazy.

551
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,393
Well, I thought you could use
some company, you know...

552
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,404
something to help
take your mind off of things.

553
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,476
They said you could take
a day or two with him...

554
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,049
and see if you guys are a good fit.

555
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,720
His name is Clover.

556
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:49,982
Clover, I want you to meet Emma. Yeah.

557
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,487
This is your new roommate.

558
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:58,293
- Clover, come here. Come here.
- Come here.

559
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,298
Clover. Come here, bud.

560
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,732
Oh, he's using the restroom.
Potty trained.

561
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,065
He's using the bathroom.

562
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,731
Make sure to put the seat up
when you're done. Or down.

563
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:12,108
- Down. You train them so fast.
- I know. I'm the cat whisperer.

564
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:17,582
- You think you're really clever, don't you?
- What? Me? No.

565
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:21,153
Okay, what am I supposed to do?
I'm not supposed to be paranoid?

566
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:24,690
No, I completely get it. Honestly, I do.

567
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,829
You know, I actually got you
something else.

568
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:32,091
I was hoping maybe you could go
to the ballet with me.

569
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,370
Thank you.

570
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,168
Get it, Clover.

571
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,070
Come here.

572
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,607
Hey.

573
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:28,881
Hey, Emma, look,
I don't want you to get freaked out...

574
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,388
but I just got a threat.

575
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,992
- Wait, what?
- An e-mail.

576
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,653
I think it's the same person
that's been harassing you.

577
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,494
Michael, what do you mean?

578
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:45,696
It's from my own e-mail, which is crazy
because I just changed the password.

579
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:52,679
It says, "do not talk to her again.
You are nothing, you are nobody.

580
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,372
You do not know what I'm capable of."

581
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:01,856
Um...

582
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:04,623
I'm gonna call the police.

583
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,856
There's nobody you can think of
that might be inclined...

584
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,395
to do something like this?

585
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,533
- Maybe an ex-boyfriend?
- No.

586
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:15,863
That's the problem,
it's been anonymous this whole time.

587
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:20,940
Okay. There's a number you can call
to get a copy of the report.

588
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,144
Let us know if anything else happens.

589
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,672
That's it?

590
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:28,406
There's not much we can do.
A crime wasn't committed.

591
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,676
There's no aggravated harassment.

592
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:32,854
If it escalates, you can call us again.

593
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:35,182
Look, my friend Michael
has been threatened.

594
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:39,724
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I understand your
frustration, but this isn't a credible threat.

595
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:44,392
We get calls like this all the time.
We can't pursue every one of them.

596
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,795
I just don't feel safe.

597
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:09,314
It's probably some 14-year-old shithead
in South Dakota...

598
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:11,583
who has nothing better to do.

599
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:17,324
I wouldn't let it freak you out too much.
I mean, it's weird, but...

600
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:22,765
He decided to mess with me randomly?
I mean, how did they get my number?

601
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:28,003
Someone banged on my door
in the middle of the night, remember?

602
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,735
I am so paranoid now.

603
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,779
I just feel like some freak
is gonna grab me wherever I go.

604
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:37,475
Oh, honey, it's definitely creepy...

605
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,017
but who knows
if that's the same person, right?

606
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,349
I mean, the banging on the door thing,
that could be an accident...

607
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,857
or some drunk idiot maybe?

608
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:51,123
I know you're freaked out, I get it.

609
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,998
Thank you so much for everything.

610
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:57,263
That's what I do.

611
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:01,842
And if anything else happens, I'm gonna
go out there and kick their ass.

612
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:06,002
All right, I just got home,
so I'll talk to you later, okay?

613
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,341
- Don't forget.
- All right.

614
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,021
Clover?

615
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:41,978
Hey there, you got Michael.
Leave a message.

616
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:46,819
Hi, Michael, please call me
as soon as you can.

617
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,684
Oh, honey, the cat was from the shelter.

618
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,519
It could have been sick. Who knows?

619
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:55,218
He was fine when I left him.
He was running around, he was eating.

620
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:56,864
I just... I don't understand.

621
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:00,899
He could have choked
on something, that's not your fault.

622
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,070
God, why is all this happening to me?

623
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:05,832
- What do you mean, "all this"?
- What's going on?

624
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,703
Emma, is something else going on?

625
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:11,402
No, no, I'm fine.

626
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:13,512
No, I don't think you're fine, Emma.

627
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,445
I can tell when something's wrong.

628
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:19,085
- Is it school?
- Come on, Emma.

629
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:22,416
Look, I didn't wanna tell you guys
because I don't wanna worry you.

630
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:27,186
- What?
- I think that someone's been stalking me.

631
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:28,885
- Stalking? What?
- What?

632
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,359
What do you mean?

633
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,434
I've been getting calls and e-mails,
and my friend Michael was threatened.

634
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,935
- Threatened?
- What do you mean, threatened?

635
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,731
Emma! Why didn't you tell us this?

636
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:40,930
Because I thought that...

637
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,077
I don't know, I thought that I could
figure this out on my own.

638
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:45,302
- Honey.
- I just...

639
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:48,779
- I didn't want you guys to worry about me.
- We're flying out there.

640
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:52,112
We'll find you a new place
to move. We're gonna talk to the po...

641
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,091
Hey there, you got Michael,
leave a message.

642
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,734
- We're flying out there.
- We'll find you a new place to move.

643
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:09,995
No. God, this all came out
of nowhere. It's like a nightmare.

644
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,002
- We're flying out there.
- Michael threatened.

645
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,538
- Emma.
- I don't understand.

646
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,175
- What am I supposed to do?
- Move.

647
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:17,309
Do not talk to her again,
you do not know what I'm capable of.

648
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,073
I think that I need to move.
I just feel like some freak. Some freak.

649
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:48,405
I know it's you, you fucking freak.

650
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:13,428
- Hello?
- Alex, have you been fucking with me?

651
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,796
- Do not lie to me.
- What?

652
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:17,300
What are you talking about?

653
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,066
Have you been hacking my shit
or prank-calling me?

654
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,572
Hacking your what?

655
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,912
Get over yourself, Emma.
First you tell me to leave you alone...

656
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,880
and now you accuse me of some bullshit?

657
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:31,575
Like, what?

658
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:34,721
Alex, please just tell me the truth.

659
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,753
Are you serious right now?

660
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,823
The world doesn't revolve
around you, okay?

661
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:46,357
- Never mind. I'm sorry that I called.
- Whatever, Emma.

662
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:02,968
- Hey.
- Hey, you all right?

663
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:05,168
Um, I'm at the coffee shop.

664
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:09,781
I just... I couldn't stay in my apartment,
I just felt trapped.

665
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:14,182
So I guess I'll meet you
at your place later?

666
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,414
Yeah, I can't get out of here
until 10 now, though.

667
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,186
Computer system's all messed up.
Everyone's freaking out.

668
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,056
Are you gonna be okay?

669
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,461
I don't know.

670
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,265
I just feel like someone's watching me.

671
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:31,928
Don't worry about it. Nothing's gonna
happen with all those people around.

672
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:35,666
I'll just meet you at your place tonight,
then we can cab it to my apartment.

673
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:39,608
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.

674
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,305
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

675
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,139
Hey, sweetie, you okay?

676
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:09,341
I'm just so frustrated.

677
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:14,839
I'm trying to do my work but I just...
I can't concentrate.

678
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:18,213
Just don't worry about your work
tonight, just try to relax.

679
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:22,480
Nicole's still coming over, right? Yeah?

680
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,988
What about Michael,
have you talked to him yet?

681
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:28,526
No. I haven't heard from him,
so I'm getting kind of worried.

682
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:32,029
Oh, honey, listen,
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

683
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:36,431
We are gonna talk to the police,
we are gonna go to campus security...

684
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,401
and we're gonna find you
a new place to live.

685
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:43,577
We're gonna find a place
with a doorman, okay?

686
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:47,578
Yeah. I've already started looking
at a few apartments, so...

687
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,772
Oh, Emma, what happened?

688
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:51,418
- Mom, I don't know what...
- Emma?

689
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,680
- I don't know what just happened.
- Honey, it's probably just a fuse that blew.

690
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:58,290
- Oh, my God.
- Emma, you're scaring me. Emma.

691
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:02,791
I can't... honey, I can't see you now.
What is that?

692
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:05,056
- Okay, I'm calling 911.
- Leave me alone!

693
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,394
- Oh, my God!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

694
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:11,595
- Emma! Emma, no!
- No!

695
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:19,738
Please, my daughter is being attacked.
What are you doing to her?

696
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:24,909
No, she's not here, she's in New York.
Please help her!

697
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,951
Get the fuck away from her!

698
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,750
She's not here, I'm just...
I'm on the computer. Oh, my God!

699
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:38,563
Please help me! He's hurting her!

700
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:42,963
Get the fuck away from her! Emma!

701
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:49,234
Where's the address?
I can't find the fucking address!

702
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:54,247
I can't find the address.
I can't find it, I can't find it.

703
01:12:54,437 --> 01:12:58,249
Please, don't hurt her!
Don't hurt my baby!

704
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:04,015
She's 23 years old.
It's Emma, my baby girl.

705
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:08,126
Who the fuck are you?
What are you doing to her?

706
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,764
Oh, my God!

707
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:13,927
I have it, I have it, I have it.

708
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:19,733
It's 8... 8... 854 Wilson Avenue,
apartment 4A...

709
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:21,738
in New York. In Brooklyn, New York.

710
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:25,504
Please hurry, it's my baby. Please hurry.

711
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,442
Where are you?

712
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:31,312
The police are on their way.
Please don't hurt her!

713
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:34,317
Emma, the police are coming.

714
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,758
She didn't do anything.

715
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:42,259
Emma, please, talk to mommy.
Talk to mommy, please.

716
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:45,762
Please. I beg you.

717
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:48,799
Emma? Emma?

718
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:55,068
Oh, my God! Emma?

719
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:58,278
Please! Please don't hurt her!

720
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:03,075
No, listen to me!
Please, why are you doing this?

721
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,214
Who are you?

722
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:10,357
Listen, listen, that's my baby girl.
That's my baby girl.

723
01:14:10,513 --> 01:14:13,687
I'm begging you, I'm begging you.

724
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,157
Emma! Oh, gosh, tell me what you want!

725
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:22,700
No, no, no! No, no, no, don't go!
Please! No...

726
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:24,780
Police! Open the door,
we're coming inside.

727
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:32,358
If anyone's in the apartment,
it's the police.

728
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:42,493
Emma Taylor. I'm from the police.
