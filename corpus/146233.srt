Terry'll make sure she is...

171
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,438
by the end of the evening.

172
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:43,144
Has he asked you
about the book yet?

173
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,243
Yes.

174
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,254
And?

175
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,457
Are you gonna tell him?

176
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:56,726
No. Maybe. I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

177
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,495
Me either.

178
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,535
- [ Sniffing ]
- [Man ]DiMaggio 's record...

179
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:03,537
for hits in consecutive games...

180
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,835
is probably the most impressive
feat in all of sports...

181
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:07,933
and in my opinion,
will never be broken.

182
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,808
- Come here, big guy.
- His condition's so sad.

183
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,143
Yes, but even blind,
he still gets around.

184
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:16,810
[Narrating]
I don't drink normally...

185
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,480
but this was turning out to be
one fucked-up day.

186
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,788
And now I found myself in close
proximity to Sara 's husband...

187
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,385
and his dog, Poe.

188
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:30,023
-Walter, I see you've met my friend.
-Oh, yes. She's charming.

189
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:32,499
Despite his much-vaunted
Harvard education...

190
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:36,299
Dr. Walter Gaskell didn't have
a clue about his wife and me.

191
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,169
Simply put, Di Maggio represented--
metaphorically speaking, of course--

192
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,175
the husband as slugger.

193
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,711
[Narrating]Poe had been
on to me since day one.

194
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:46,339
- [ Poe Growling ]
- In fact, I personally believe...

195
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:50,909
that every woman in some way
desires to be Marilyn Monroe.

196
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,420
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

197
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,720
[Man ] I've had a lot
of successes over the years.

198
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,193
[Narrating]
Q. Q was rich.

199
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,230
Q was famous.

200
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,061
Q completed a novel
every 18 months.

201
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:07,102
I hated him.

202
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:09,399
...finest work vanished
in less than five.

203
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:12,269
So I find myself conflicted.

204
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:15,868
Ask him if he's conflicted
about his house in the Hamptons.

205
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,913
- Grady.
- Well, Professor.

206
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,278
Q. for your information...

207
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,214
Hannah already has
two stories published...

208
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:26,687
in The Paris Review, so you
better dust off your "A " material.

209
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,986
You didn't tell me
you were a writer.

210
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,548
You didn't ask.

211
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,561
[Man ]How did you feel
about the adaptation?

212
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,654
I thought it was more literary
than cinematic.

213
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:36,891
[Man ]
Grady.

214
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,263
Douglas Triddley, Amherst.

215
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:40,528
I've had Arsonist 's Daughter...

216
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:43,070
on my graduate-studies syllabus
three years running.

217
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,572
No wonder it's still in print.

218
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,076
[ Woman ]Long time since
Arsonist's Daughter.

219
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,097
[ Walter]
There you are.

220
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:15,626
I could have sworn I had a bottle
of 1975 Lafite Rothschild for Q.

221
00:13:15,704 --> 00:13:17,695
Given that he's going to be
addressing 500 people...

222
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,206
in less than an hour--

223
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:21,970
- You want to keep Q happy.
- If he's happy, I'm happy.

224
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:31,008
[ Twig Snaps]

225
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:45,092
James?

226
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,006
It's fake.
It was my mother's.

227
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:55,009
She won it in a penny arcade
in Baltimore...

228
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,136
when she went
to Catholic school.

229
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:01,009
Well, that's very convincing.

230
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,847
I used to shoot
these little paper caps...

231
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,353
but they don't make them anymore,
the caps.

232
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:10,118
It's just for good luck, you know?
Some people carry rabbit's feet.

233
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:12,683
You carry firearms.

234
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,556
No, thank you. I don't like
to lose control of my emotions.

235
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:23,237
I'm not supposed to be here,
in case you're wondering.

236
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:26,035
But the other night I was out
with Hannah at the movies...

237
00:14:26,108 --> 00:14:30,670
and she asked me since she was
coming, so I ended up coming too.

238
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,907
You and, uh, Hannah,
you're seeing each other?

239
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,973
- No! What gave you that idea?
-James, relax.

240
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:38,383
I'm not her father.
I just rent her a room.

241
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:41,388
She likes old movies like I do,
that's all.

242
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:44,220
- What's the movie you guys saw?
- Son of Fury...

243
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,693
with Tyrone Power
and Frances Farmer.

244
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,493
She went crazy,
Frances Farmer.

245
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:53,056
So did Gene Tierney.
She's in it too.

246
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:56,568
- Sounds like a good one.
- It wasn't bad.

247
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,300
You're not like
my other teachers, Prof. Tripp.

248
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:05,437
You're not like
my other students, James.

249
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,914
Look, James...

250
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:11,612
about this afternoon
in workshop, I'm sorry.

251
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,985
I think I let things
get a little out of hand.

252
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,045
They really hated it.

253
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,591
I think they hated it more
than any of the other ones.

254
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,354
- Well--
- Doesn't matter.

255
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:21,589
It only took me
an hour to write.

256
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:25,121
Really? That's remarkable.

257
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,691
I have trouble sleeping.

258
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:31,899
While I'm lying in bed,
I figure them out, the stories.

259
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:37,805
- You cold, James?
- Oh, a little.

260
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:40,279
Why don 't we go inside?

261
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:42,283
It's colder in there.

262
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,411
[ Chuckles ]
I guess you're right.

263
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,547
Actually, I saw the greenhouse.

264
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:51,922
I thought I'd come outside and take
a look at it. It looks like heaven.

265
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,729
- Looks like heaven?
- I saw a movie once.

266
00:15:56,798 --> 00:16:00,757
Part of it took place in heaven.
Everyone wore white.

267
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,327
Lived in crystal houses
like that.

268
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:06,933
I really should be going.

269
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,369
- Good-bye, Prof. Tripp.
- Hey, James.

270
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:14,881
James, don't go. No.

271
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,111
There's something
I want you to see.

272
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:22,580
- I'll miss my bus.
- It's worth it.

273
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,591
Trust me.

274
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:31,248
[Hannah ]
Let me help you with that.

275
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:33,850
Thank you, dear.
Thank you.

276
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,647
Come on.

277
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,587
[Hannah ]Hey, you two.
James, are you riding with me?

278
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:46,288
- No, I'm going home--
- No, he's going with me.

279
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:49,526
Why don't you take Crabtree
and his friend? All right?

280
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,296
- All right.
- Where are they anyway?

281
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,701
Here we are.

282
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:58,765
Hmm. Well, hello there.

283
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:02,642
James, this is my editor,
Terry Crabtree.

284
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:03,702
James.

285
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:05,476
[Hannah ]James'll know
about George Sanders.

286
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,779
- George Sanders?
- Mr. Crabtree was saying...

287
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,843
how George Sanders killed himself,
only he couldn't remember how.

288
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:15,381
Pills. April 25, 1 972,
in a Costa Brava hotel room.

289
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,620
- How comprehensive of you.
- [Hannah ]James is amazing.

290
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:21,289
He knows all the movie suicides.
Go ahead, James. Tell him.

291
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:23,993
- There are so many.
- Well, just a few. The big ones.

292
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:29,027
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72,
also pills.

293
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:31,597
Donald " Red " Barry,
shot himself in 1 980.

294
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,939
Charles Boyer,
1978, pills again.

295
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,004
Charles Butterworth, 1946,
I think. In a car.

296
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:42,017
Supposedly, it was an accident,
but, you know, he was distraught.

297
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:46,385
Dorothy Dandridge, pills, 1965.
Albert Dekker, 1968.

298
00:17:46,457 --> 00:17:47,446
He hung himself.

299
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,492
He wrote his suicide note
in lipstick on his stomach.

300
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,051
William lnge,
carbon monoxide, 1973.

301
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,495
Carole Landis, pills again.
I forget when.

302
00:17:54,565 --> 00:17:57,432
George Reeves,
"Superman" on TV, shot himself.

303
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,402
Jean Seberg, pills,
of course, 1 979.

304
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:03,599
Everett Sloane--
he was good-- pills.

305
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:06,541
Margaret Sulla van, pills.
Lupe Velez, a lot of pills.

306
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,511
Gig Young, he shot himself
and his wife in 1 978.

307
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,241
There are tons more.

308
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:14,148
- I haven't heard of half of them.
- You did them alphabetically.

309
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,209
It's just how my bra in works,
I guess.

310
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,446
Fascinating.

311
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:19,182
Come out with us
after the lecture.

312
00:18:19,256 --> 00:18:21,247
There's this place
I always get Tripp to take me.

313
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:23,793
-Actually, I just want to go home.
-Don 't be silly.

314
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,557
No one your age
just wants to go home.

315
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,396
Besides, faculty will be present.
Just consider it a field trip.

316
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:53,989
[James]
ls that really it?

317
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,655
That's really it.

318
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:00,390
The one she wore
on her wedding day.

319
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:02,591
So I'm told.

320
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,832
- Go ahead.
- Really?

321
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,873
Really.

322
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:24,912
She was small.

323
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:27,081
Most people don't know that.

324
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,650
The shoulders
are so small.

325
00:19:35,198 --> 00:19:37,598
It looks so perfect.

326
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:42,100
I bet it's the only time
she wore it.

327
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,106
That day.

328
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:48,668
She must have felt so happy.

329
00:19:51,748 --> 00:19:56,845
- Must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
- I guess.

330
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,320
He also never tells Sara
the truth...

331
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:02,017
about how much
he pays for these things.

332
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:05,186
You're really good friends
with the chancellor, aren't you?

333
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:10,729
Pretty good.

334
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:14,328
I'm friends
with her husband too.

335
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:17,464
I guess you must be if you know
the combination to his closet...

336
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,669
