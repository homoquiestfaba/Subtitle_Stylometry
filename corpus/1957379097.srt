00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,058
 - PROBABLY HER THIRD. 

494
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,096
 - THIS ALWAYS BUGGED ME... 

495
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,079
 HIS NAME THERE. 

496
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,046
 IT SHOULD JUST READ,
 "BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER." 

497
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:02,017
 - WELL...HE WAS HER HUSBAND, 

498
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:03,054
 AND HE LOVED HER. 

499
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:10,042
 OH, WE WERE ALWAYS SURE
 TO FIND OUR CATIE 

500
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:13,008
 UNDER THE BED
 WHENEVER THEY YELLED. 

501
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,042
 - WHEN HE YELLED, YOU MEAN. 

502
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:19,012
 COME ON, HE NEVER LET UP ON HER. 

503
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:20,012
 SHE SPENT HALF MY CHILDHOOD 

504
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,096
 IN THE GAZEBO CRYING. 

505
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:23,054
 - AND GETTING PIE-EYED. 

506
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:26,033
 THAT&amp;apos;S WHERE
 SHE STASHED HER BOTTLES. 

507
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:27,062
 - YEAH, WELL... 

508
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:30,054
 IT WAS HIS FAULT
 SHE DRANK, ANYWAY. 

509
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:32,042
 - COME ON, CATE.
 SHE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC. 

510
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:35,017
 - YOU&amp;apos;VE NEVER SAID
 A BAD WORD ABOUT DAD. 

511
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:36,092
 - NO, I HAVEN&amp;apos;T, 

512
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,029
 AND I HATE IT THAT YOU DO. 

513
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,004
 I WISH I COULD FIND
 A MAN HALF AS GOOD. 

514
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,083
 - IT WASN&amp;apos;T THAT HARD FOR ME. 

515
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:04,088
 - OF COURSE
 THEY WANT TO SEE YOU. 

516
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:06,004
 - [LAUGHS] 

517
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:08,058
 - THEY ALWAYS ASK
 IF YOU&amp;apos;RE COMING
 WITH ME. THEY DO. 

518
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,058
 [CLOCK CHIMES] 

519
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:48,046
 - THIS POTATO SALAD...
 IS DELICIOUS. 

520
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:49,088
 UNUSUAL. 

521
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,092
 - A PLACE IN THE VILLAGE
 MAKES IT FRESH. 

522
00:24:52,092 --> 00:24:54,012
 WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE? 

523
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,033
 - THANK YOU. 

524
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,079
 PHILIP? 

525
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,004
 - UH-HUH? 

526
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,054
 - I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. 

527
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,088
 - FIRE AWAY. 

528
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:16,054
 - WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ME?
 - WHAT? 

529
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,025
 - WHAT--
 - DOING? 

530
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:20,096
 - WHAT DO YOU SEE IN ME? 

531
00:25:20,096 --> 00:25:22,042
 - [SIGHS] 

532
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,042
 I CAN&amp;apos;T CATEGORIZE IT. 

533
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:25,004
 - TRY. 

534
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,025
 - [SIGHS] ALL RIGHT. OK, UM... 

535
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:30,033
 YOU&amp;apos;RE NICE TO ME. 

536
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,038
 EXCUSE ME. 

537
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:32,058
 - GO ON. 

538
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:36,046
 - UH... 

539
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,042
 YOU MAKE ME FEEL GOOD. 

540
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,058
 YOU&amp;apos;RE NOT DEMANDING. 

541
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:42,050
 - DEMANDING. 

542
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,088
 - YOU KNOW, YOU DON&amp;apos;T--
 YOU DON&amp;apos;T... 

543
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,033
 BADGER ME TO GO PLACES
 AND DO THINGS 

544
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,096
 I DON&amp;apos;T WANT TO GO OR DO. 

545
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:51,021
 - BUT, PHILIP, THESE ARE THINGS 

546
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:52,092
 THAT DESCRIBE HOW
 I ACT TOWARDS YOU. 

547
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,029
 WHAT IS IT ABOUT ME
 THAT YOU LIKE? 

548
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,088
 MY OWN QUALITIES. 

549
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:03,029
 - I REALLY DON&amp;apos;T SEE
 WHERE THIS IS GOING. 

550
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,067
 I LIKE EVERYTHING. 

551
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:06,046
 YOU&amp;apos;RE PERFECT. 

552
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:09,058
 DON&amp;apos;T CHANGE, OK? 

553
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,088
 PLEASE GET IN THE CAR. 

554
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:20,025
 [RING] 

555
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,075
 - REMODEL INCORPORATED.
 LET US REMODEL YOU. 

556
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:24,054
 HARRY! 

557
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:27,008
 YES, SHE&amp;apos;S HERE. 

558
00:26:27,008 --> 00:26:29,021
 ISN&amp;apos;T SHE? 

559
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,021
 WHAT DID I TELL YOU? 

560
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:33,000
 - GIVE IT. 

561
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,004
 HELLO? 

562
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:36,029
 HI! 

563
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,088
 UH... 

564
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:42,021
 REMODELING, YEAH. 

565
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,067
 CYNTHIA TALKED ME INTO IT. 

566
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:48,004
 NOW? 

567
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:51,017
 OK. 

568
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:53,038
 [CHUCKLES] YEAH. 

569
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,012
 OK, BYE. 

570
00:26:58,012 --> 00:26:59,042
 - WHAT DID HE SAY? 

571
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,058
 - NOTHING. 

572
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:02,021
 - NOTHING? 

573
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:04,021
 - WE&amp;apos;RE HAVING COFFEE. 

574
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,054
 - LISTEN, HARRY IS CHARMING,
 HANDSOME, AND SMART. 

575
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:07,083
 IT&amp;apos;S OK TO LIKE HIM. 

576
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:13,017
 - IT&amp;apos;S JUST COFFEE. 

577
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:15,017
 - WELL, THAT
 WASN&amp;apos;T ENOUGH FOR GUS, 

578
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:18,046
 SO HE BEFRIENDED THE WIDOW
 WHO LIVED ONE FLOOR BELOW US. 

579
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:19,075
 - IN THE SAME BUILDING? 

580
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:22,054
 - OH, YES. OH, YES. 

581
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,075
 BUT SHE HAD 2 SONS,
 EX-MARINES BOTH, 

582
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:27,079
 WHO DID NOT APPROVE OF GUS. 

583
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:30,025
 SO HE PUT ON AN OVERCOAT, 

584
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,088
 A HAT, A SCARF,
 A FAKE MUSTACHE-- 

585
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:34,004
 AND THIS WAS
 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER-- 

586
00:27:34,004 --> 00:27:36,000
 AND HE&amp;apos;D GO DOWN THE FIRE ESCAPE
 TO CALL ON THE WIDOW. 

587
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,071
 - [LAUGHING] 

588
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,050
 - AND MY MOM EVENTUALLY
 TOOK HIM BACK, 

589
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,088
 FORGAVE HIM. 

590
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:42,054
 AND AFTER SHE DIED,
 HE WENT OUT TO CALIFORNIA 

591
00:27:42,054 --> 00:27:46,038
 TO DO THE RACETRACK CIRCUIT,
 WHERE HE DIED OF A CORONARY. 

592
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:48,012
 - BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
 YOU LIKED HIM. 

593
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:49,079
 - OH, YEAH. 

594
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:51,000
 WHAT A CHARACTER. 

595
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:05,067
 THERE&amp;apos;S A HITCHCOCK FESTIVAL
 THIS WEEK AT THE UPTOWN. 

596
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,029
 - OH, REALLY? 

597
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,029
 THEY ALWAYS LOOK SO MUCH BETTER
 ON THE BIG SCREEN, 

598
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:13,021
 ESPECIALLY THE
 BLACK-AND-WHITE ONES. 

599
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:16,062
 YOU DON&amp;apos;T GET
 THAT CONTRAST ON TV. 

600
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,088
 - WAS THAT A YES? 

601
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,050
 HOW ABOUT A RIDE? 

602
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,083
 - UH... 

603
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,058
 NO, THANKS.
 I&amp;apos;LL WALK. 

604
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,062
 - WELL, I&amp;apos;LL CHECK
 THE MOVIE TIMES. 

605
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:28,008
 I&amp;apos;LL GIVE YOU A CALL. 

606
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:29,029
 - WHATEVER. 

607
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,054
 - I&amp;apos;M SO GLAD
 YOU&amp;apos;RE DOING IT UP. 

608
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:41,075
 - YEAH?
 - IT NEEDED THAT. 

609
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:42,092
 I MISS IT. 

610
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:43,083
 - THE SHOP? 

611
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,029
 - YEAH, MORE THAN
 I THOUGHT I WOULD. 

612
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,088
 THE KIND OF--YOU KNOW,
 THE CHATTERING,
 THE TALKING TO PEOPLE. 

613
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:50,079
 THAT&amp;apos;S WHAT
 I REALLY, REALLY MISS. 

614
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,088
 - WELL, YOU CAN COME BACK
 ANYTIME YOU WANT, YOU KNOW. 

615
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:53,096
 - YEAH. 

616
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:55,062
 LOOK, HONESTLY,
 LOOK AT THESE WEEDS. 

617
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:58,004
 YOU&amp;apos;D THINK SOMEBODY&amp;apos;D
 GIVE THEM A WHACK. 

618
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:00,025
 OH, LOOK WHAT
 WE&amp;apos;VE GOT HERE. 

619
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,083
 - WHAT?
 - HE&amp;apos;S SEEN BETTER DAYS. 

620
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,033
 A LITTLE CUPID. 

621
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,071
 AH, LOOK. 

622
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:07,083
 - FUNNY, CYNTHIA AND I
 WERE JUST TALKING 

623
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,050
 ABOUT CUPIDS FOR THE SHOP. 

624
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,042
 - THERE, THERE, LOOK, SEE?
 HE&amp;apos;S SMILING. 

625
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,046
 DO YOU WANT HIM? 

626
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,000
 - WELL, HE&amp;apos;S CUTE, ISN&amp;apos;T HE? 

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,058
 - WELL, HE&amp;apos;S
 A SAUCY LITTLE CHAP. 

628
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:19,029
 [LAUGHS] 

629
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,004
 COME ON, LET&amp;apos;S ASK HOW MUCH
 THEY WANT FOR IT. 

630
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:22,000
 - OK. 

631
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,058
 - UHH!
 - IS IT HEAVY? 

632
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:25,042
 - YES. 

633
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:27,054
 ACTUALLY, I COULD HELP YOU
 WITH THE BOOKS. 

634
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:28,079
 - YES. 

635
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,083
 - [PEOPLE CHATTERING] 

636
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,033
 - FEEL LIKE CHINESE? 

637
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,067
 - YOU SAID A MOVIE.
 WE DID THE MOVIE. 

638
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:48,025
 YOU NEVER SAID
 A MOVIE AND DINNER. 

639
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:50,025
 - TAKEOUT IS HARDLY DINNER.
 WE WOULDN&amp;apos;T HAVE TO GO OUT. 

640
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:51,088
 WE COULD EAT ON YOUR BALCONY. 

641
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,004
 - WAIT-- 

642
00:29:54,004 --> 00:29:56,062
 HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW
 I HAVE A BALCONY? 

643
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,050
 - ALL THE APARTMENTS
 IN YOUR BUILDING HAVE
 A BALCONY, DON&amp;apos;T THEY? 

644
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,071
 - OH, RIGHT. 

645
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:09,025
 - AH, THIS IS GREAT. 

646
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,096
 I&amp;apos;M SORRY.
 DO YOU WANT A PLATE? 

647
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:16,025
 - NO, I THOUGHT
 WE COULD EAT FAMILY STYLE 

648
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:17,017
 IF THAT&amp;apos;S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU. 

649
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:18,075
 - OH, SURE.
 THAT&amp;apos;S GREAT. 

650
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:22,042
 - MMM, FRIED RICE. 

651
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,075
 - IS IT GOOD?
 - GOOD. 

652
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:25,012
 WANT SOME?
 TRY IT. 

653
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:26,025
 - OK, YOU WANT
 TO TRY MINE? 

654
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,042
 - SURE. 

655
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:30,088
 MMM. 

656
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,008
 THIS IS ONE OF
 MY FAVORITES. 

657
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:41,092
 CAN I GET YOU
 SOME LONGER CHOPSTICKS? 

658
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:44,004
 - [LAUGHS] 

659
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:47,062
 I KNOW. 

660
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,008
 HA HA HA! 

661
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,067
 I KNOW, I-- 

662
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:54,071
 I HUNCH OVER MY FOOD LIKE--

01:16:10,096 --> 01:16:15,004
 I THINK I&amp;apos;M GONNA HAVE TO GET
 A LARGER DINING ROOM TABLE. 

1654
01:16:15,004 --> 01:16:17,042
 OH, GRACIE. 

1655
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,062
 GRACIE, I MISS YOU SO MUCH. 

1656
01:16:19,062 --> 01:16:21,046
 JUST LIKE YOU ALWAYS
 SAID I WOULD. 

1657
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:22,062
 - HI. 

1658
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,083
 - OH, HI. 

1659
01:16:27,079 --> 01:16:30,004
 - UH, NO.
 DAD, WAIT. I... 

1660
01:16:33,054 --> 01:16:36,033
 THIS IS AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY. 

1661
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:38,000
 BETTER THAN MOST, I... 

1662
01:16:42,029 --> 01:16:43,079
 [VOICE CRACKING]
 WELL, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY, 

1663
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:45,075
 NOT JUST FOR
 WHAT I SAID LAST WEEK-- 

1664
01:16:45,075 --> 01:16:47,096
 - I WAS WRONG. 

1665
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:50,025
 DROPPING BY
 WITHOUT CALLING FIRST. 

1666
01:16:50,025 --> 01:16:54,004
 - NO! DAD, WOULD YOU JUST
 LET ME SAY IT! 

1667
01:17:09,021 --> 01:17:10,075
 - HE WAS PROBABLY SO STUNNED 

1668
01:17:10,075 --> 01:17:13,067
 TO HEAR THE WORD "APOLOGIZE"
 COME OUT OF CATE&amp;apos;S MOUTH, 

1669
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:15,029
 HE DIDN&amp;apos;T KNOW
 WHAT TO DO WITH HIMSELF. 

1670
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:16,029
 GRACE, MAYA, GO AND WASH UP. 

1671
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:18,025
 WE&amp;apos;RE EATING IN 5 MINUTES. 

1672
01:17:18,025 --> 01:17:20,054
 - WELL, WE DON&amp;apos;T KNOW
 WHAT TO DO, EITHER. 

1673
01:17:20,054 --> 01:17:21,042
 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 

1674
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:22,083
 - WELL, WE DON&amp;apos;T. 

1675
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:24,042
 CYNTHIA, YOU JUST SPOIL HIM, 

1676
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:26,033
 AND FRANCESCA IS TOO BUSY, 

1677
01:17:26,033 --> 01:17:27,025
 AND I... 

1678
01:17:27,025 --> 01:17:28,050
 HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
 IT WAS CATE&amp;apos;S ISSUE 

1679
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:31,025
 AND IT DIDN&amp;apos;T AFFECT ME,
 BUT LET&amp;apos;S FACE IT... 

1680
01:17:31,025 --> 01:17:32,071
 IT AFFECTS ALL OF US. 

1681
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:50,067
 - OH, THANK YOU. 

1682
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:12,067
 - IS ANYBODY TALKING
 TO ANYBODY? 

1683
01:18:14,054 --> 01:18:17,000
 - I TRIED THAT.
 DIDN&amp;apos;T WORK. 

1684
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,092
 - CAITLIN. 

1685
01:18:18,092 --> 01:18:19,096
 WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN ME
 AND YOUR MOTHER 

1686
01:18:19,096 --> 01:18:23,021
 HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. 

1687
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:24,050
 - FINE. 

1688
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:27,008
 - AT YOUR AGE, I SHOULD THINK
 YOU&amp;apos;D UNDERSTAND THAT. 

1689
01:18:27,008 --> 01:18:28,050
 - I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. 

1690
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:30,096
 I SAW THE WAY YOU TREATED HER.
 I THOUGHT YOU HATED HER. 

1691
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:32,075
 I USED TO DREAM ABOUT
 RUNNING AWAY WITH HER 

1692
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:34,017
 SO SHE COULD HAVE SOME PEACE. 

1693
01:18:34,017 --> 01:18:38,004
 - DON&amp;apos;T TELL ME HOW I FELT
 ABOUT MY WIFE! 

1694
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:42,071
 YOU THOUGHT I DIDN&amp;apos;T
 LOVE YOUR MOTHER? 

1695
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:43,092
 HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT? 

1696
01:18:43,092 --> 01:18:47,012
 - BECAUSE YOU YELLED AT HER
 LIKE YOU&amp;apos;RE YELLING AT ME! 

1697
01:18:49,075 --> 01:18:53,000
 I&amp;apos;M SORRY.
 MAYBE I DIDN&amp;apos;T UNDERSTAND,
 AND--AND-- 

1698
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,042
 I WAS TRYING
 TO SAY I WAS SORRY. 

1699
01:19:01,067 --> 01:19:03,088
 - WELL... 

1700
01:19:03,088 --> 01:19:05,054
 BETTER LATE THAN NEVER, I GUESS. 

1701
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:09,012
 - THAT&amp;apos;S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 

1702
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:11,021
 WHETHER YOU ACCEPT
 HER APOLOGY OR YOU DON&amp;apos;T. 

1703
01:19:11,021 --> 01:19:13,025
 - MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
 FRANCESCA. 

1704
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:15,062
 - THIS IS MY BUSINESS, DAMN IT. 

1705
01:19:15,062 --> 01:19:17,054
 - DON&amp;apos;T CURSE AT THIS TABLE! 

1706
01:19:17,054 --> 01:19:19,012
 - HA HA!
 YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1707
01:19:19,012 --> 01:19:20,083
 YOUR YELLING DOESN&amp;apos;T
 INTIMIDATE ME. 

1708
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:23,008
 YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES?
 IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE. 

1709
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,079
 FROM NOW ON, IF YOU HAVE
 ANYTHING TO SAY TO ME, 

1710
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:26,079
 ANYTHING AT ALL, 

1711
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,017
 YOU WILL SAY IT
 IN A RESPECTFUL MANNER, 

1712
01:19:29,017 --> 01:19:30,033
 LIKE A HUMAN BEING! 

1713
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:33,000
 - ARE YOU FINISHED?
 - NO, WE&amp;apos;RE NOT. 

1714
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
 WELL, AT ANY RATE, I&amp;apos;M NOT. 

1715
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,004
 YOU CAN&amp;apos;T EVEN ACCEPT
 CATE&amp;apos;S APOLOGY 

1716
01:19:37,004 --> 01:19:38,075
 WITHOUT STICKING
 IN YOUR 2 CENTS&amp;apos; WORTH 

1717

 OF ANGER AND BITTERNESS. 

1718
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:42,000
 WELL, IT&amp;apos;S NOT RIGHT! 

1719
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,025
 AND I&amp;apos;M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
 AND LET IT GO BY. 

1720
01:19:44,025 --> 01:19:46,025
 - HONEY--
 - NO! I&amp;apos;M TIRED OF SMILING 

1721
01:19:46,025 --> 01:19:48,058
 AND PRETENDING EVERYTHING&amp;apos;S OK.
 IT&amp;apos;S NOT OK! 

1722
01:19:48,058 --> 01:19:50,046
 - YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
 TO SAY THAT TO ME. 

1723
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,067
 I DON&amp;apos;T SEE ANY OF YOU
 RAISING 4 KIDS 

1724
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,046
 AND BUILDING A BUSINESS
 AT THE SAME TIME. 

1725
01:19:54,046 --> 01:19:55,092
 WITH A SICK WIFE IN BED! 

1726
01:19:55,092 --> 01:19:57,021
 - SHE WASN&amp;apos;T SICK. 

1727
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:01,062
 SHE WAS DRUNK. 

1728
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:08,008
 - DON&amp;apos;T YOU
 CRITICIZE YOUR MOTHER 

1729
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:11,038
 AT THIS TABLE. 

1730
01:20:11,038 --> 01:20:13,021
 AND NOT A ONE OF YOU 

1731
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,062

01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:22,008
 OH, I THANK GOD
 SHE&amp;apos;S NOT HERE 

1733
01:20:22,008 --> 01:20:24,025
 TO LISTEN TO WHAT
 YOU HAVE TO SAY! 

1734

 - DAD! 

1735
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:33,042
 YOU CAN&amp;apos;T JUST WALK
 AWAY FROM ME AGAIN! 

1736
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:36,025
 - I CAN. IF YOU&amp;apos;RE GOING
 TO ATTACK HER. 

1737
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:37,075
 - WHY WOULD I ATTACK HER? 

1738
01:20:37,075 --> 01:20:40,017
 [CRYING]
 I LOST HER, TOO! 

1739
01:20:40,017 --> 01:20:41,092
 SHE WAS MY MOTHER!

1744
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
 I TRIED EVERYTHING I COULD
 TO GET HER TO STOP, 

1745
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,008
 BUT NOTHING WORKED. 

1746
01:21:31,008 --> 01:21:33,062
 I COULDN&amp;apos;T SAVE HER. 

1747
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:35,042
 FINALLY, ALL I COULD
 DO WAS YELL, 

1748
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:37,096
 AND THAT ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE.

01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,067
 [SOFTLY] I&amp;apos;M SORRY. 

1751
01:21:47,079 --> 01:21:50,088
 WITH HER GONE, I FEEL LIKE
 I&amp;apos;VE LOST SOMETHING OF MYSELF.
