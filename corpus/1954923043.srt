00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,116
What's up, dog?

3
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,283
What up?

4
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,317
You bring the money?

5
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,419
Hell yeah.

6
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:10,790
I got three bucks.

7
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:11,824
We have five bucks.

8
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:13,192
That's not enough for
a six-pack.

9
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:14,744
Six pack?

10
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,295
Damn, Beetle, you so fancy.
You want to drink it

11
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,629
from a glass slipper,
too? Or, how about

12
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,464
I serve it to you on a nice,
velvet pillow?

13
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:20,782
Shut up, Joker.

14
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:22,099
I don't like that nasty-ass
malt liquor you drink.

15
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,835
Dude, two 40s we'll be cool.
It's enough, too, man, I

16
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,069
thought you wanted to catch a
buzz.

17
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:28,071
All right, whatever.
Whatever, whatever.

18
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:29,639
Go ask that guy right there.

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,206
Man quit being a wussy
and go ask him shy boy.

20
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,741
I'm not gonna
ask him, you ask him.

21
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:34,076
Come on, he's leaving.

22
00:02:34,077 --> 00:02:35,410
Well go talk to him then, quick.

23
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:36,377
Never mind, it's too late.

24
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,113
I'll ask the next
person that comes by.

25
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,181
Hey, Sharky.

26
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:51,188
What's up, Sharky?

27
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,689
What's up, suckers?

28
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,357
How much we got, fools?

29
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,925
This.

30
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,492
Joker says he's gonna ask
the next person that comes by.

31
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:00,295
And that's you, Sharky.
You right on point, dog.

32
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,797
Sheesh. Leave
it to the master, fools.

33
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,299
Look at that...
You fools just watch.

34
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,099
Cup check.

35
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,433
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoooooo!

36
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:10,568
I'll ask anything
from anyone, any time.

37
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,570
That's how I get what I want.
Not like you fools

38
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:15,573
standing there holding your
nuts.

39
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,575
Oh, shit. It's Coach.

40
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,209
Go ask him, Sharky.

41
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,311
It's summer vacation,
he's got no authority over us now.

42
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:24,414
Nah man, but camp
starts in a few days.

43
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,849
Nah, just be cool, be cool.

44
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:29,585
Rodriguez. Hope you
take care of that arm.

45
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:30,652
You're gonna need it this
season.

46
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:32,353
You know it, Coach. I feel good.

47
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:36,256
Good, good, son.
What are you guys up to?

48
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,491
Just hanging out, Coach.

49
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:39,592
Just hanging out?

50
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,559
Yup, hanging out.

51
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,826
Yeah, just chillin.

52
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:45,747
Chillin, huh?

53
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:49,667
Chilly-chill. Chilled out.
Just chillin' like a cold beer...

54
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:52,436
which I don't drink.
We don't drink beer...

55
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,272
Come on, guys. I know
what you guys are up to.

56
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:58,241
I was your age once.
You want someone to

57
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,176
score you some beer that has ID?

58
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:04,580
What? Oh, beer? Nooo!
No Coach, we're under age!

59
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:08,583
Give me the money. Give
me the money, I'll get the beer.

60
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:09,917
You serious?

61
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,685
You want the beer or not?

62
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:13,820
What, do you think I'm running
an undercover sting operation?

63
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:19,724
NERVOUS LAUGHTER

64
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,560
Just give me the money.

65
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,162
All right, here you go.

66
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,164
So you guys want,
a 12-pack or something?

67
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,565
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:32,701
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
a 12-pack would be cool.

69
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,469
Did that just happen?

70
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:35,570
Can you believe that, ay?

71
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,371
The man is buying us some beer.

72
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,073
Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,774
This is gonna
be the best summer ever.

74
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,777
Oh, shit.

75
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:47,847
Cool, just be cool man.
Just be cool.

76
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,782
We're just, we're waiting for
our ride, all right...

77
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:51,216
we're just waiting for our ride.

78
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:51,950
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:58,356
Don't look at him.

80
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:03,694
He's looking right at us.

81
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:04,861
I'm texting.

82
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:05,728
Don't look at him.

83
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,230
Don't look suspicious.

84
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:08,731
Texting's not suspicious.

85
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,798
He's looking right at us.

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,367
JOKER;
Bro, don't move. Stop moving.

87
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:17,204
Oh my God he's got a big gun.
That's a big gun.

88
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:21,307
Woah!

89
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:22,808
Oh man! You got scared!

90
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,043
No! You got scared!
Bro, I was looking -

91
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,277
Yo, both of you got scared.

92
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,511
I was just stretching, man.

93
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:28,229
Man, I went like this.
I went like this.

94
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,946
Sir... Man I was pitching!
I was just stretching my arm out.

95
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,882
You know? Whoosh!

96
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:34,217
Whatever, you were sketch.

97
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,851
Scared, dude!

98
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,219
Hey, here comes your
Coach, here comes Coach.

99
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:38,787
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up.

100
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:40,455
Here comes, here comes.

101
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:43,324
One for me, and this
one's for you gentlemen.

102
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,326
Got you my favorite brand.

103
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,495
All right thanks Coach!
Good looking out!

104
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:50,763
Sharky, this
is non-alcoholic beer.

105
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:54,866
What? For real? Oh,
hell, no, that's not cool.

106
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,701
Man, this is
the last of our money.

107
00:05:56,703 --> 00:05:58,703
I thought he was being cool.
He's culero. Forget what I said.

108
00:05:58,705 --> 00:05:59,970
Coach we hate your guts!
We think you suck!

109
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,838
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
Hey, Coach, whassup?
Why you gotta do us like that?

111
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:07,876
Rodriguez, I'm doing you a favor.
You're a good athlete.

112
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,879
But you're smarter than that.
You could be somebody.

113
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,882
Hang out with these 2 clowns,
trying to score beer,

114
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,617
you're not gonna get anywhere.

115
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,351
Yo, first of all coach,
those 2 clowns over there -

116
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:19,787
those are my homies, right?
And I'll tell you right now

117
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:22,422
I am somebody and I don't need
your pinche validation or your

118
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,825
stupid-ass non-alcoholic beer.

119
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,359
Don't you understand
it, just control yourself!

120
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,260
Man, get off me! Psssh!

121
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:31,262
That's it. You're
cut from the team.

122
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,397
Yo, have fun
with that magazine, huh?

123
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,299
Don't even worry
about coming to camp, son.

124
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,300
Freeze!

125
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:41,737
SHRIEKING

126
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:43,705
You once had a
wet dream about Mr. T.

127
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,939
And that's true and you know it.

128
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:46,824
Bullshit.

129
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,708
Remember that time we went
on a class field trip to Yosemite?

130
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,377
When we were, like, 12?

131
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,044
That's right. Remember,
you woke up screaming one night,

132
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,347
saying Mr. T. was gonna get you
from behind cabron.

133
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,349
I remember. No,
no, that was a nightmare.

134
00:06:56,351 --> 00:06:58,017
I had a dream that I stole
Mr. T's van and he was

135
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,518
gonna put the hurt on me.

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,720
But anyway, moron, that's
not what a wet dream means.

137
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,174
Whatever you say
puto I guess Mr. T.

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,722
Was just putting

139
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,224
a hurting on you.

140
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,725
My god, can you
both of you just shut up?

141
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,561
Look, I just got
kicked off the team.

142
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:13,031
I lost my bat, my glove. You ask
me, both of y'all are gay.

143
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,832
I've never seen either
one of you with a girl.

144
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,433
Either that or
you're both virgins.

145
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,434
Shit no, I ain't no virgin!

146
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,037
I got laid last
summer in church camp.

147
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:22,639
Humping your Mayor McCheese
pillow doesn't count, Joker.

148
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,440
Look, fool, there's Felicia.

149
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,844
All right, cool, Beetle,
she ain't gonna bite you.

150
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:33,314
She ain't no Mr. T, but you got
to give girls a try sometime.

151
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:34,515
Is that Beetle?

152
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,919
Yeah. Hey, Beetle. What's up?

153
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:44,457
She sees you. She's
waving, wave back, fool.

154
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:48,093
Hi, Felicia.

155
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,394
MUSIC OUT

156
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:51,896
Oh my god.

157
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,531
Are you all right, Beetle?

158
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:55,498
What's up, man?

159
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,868
I'll survive.

160
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,636
Direct hit.

161
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:02,737
We're gonna be over there.

162
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,605
Oh, my god, are you okay?

163
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,041
Yeah. Ow.

164
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:11,411
You have... let me see.

165
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:13,546
What happened?

166
00:08:13,548 --> 00:08:15,915
I got a boo-boo.

167
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:19,585
Damn, Beetle.
You got really banged up.

168
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:22,354
I'm okay, it only hurts
when I move any part of my body.

169
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,689
I'm serious. Beetle.
I'm worried about you.

170
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:27,091
Why would you
be worried about me?

171
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,960
Beetle, I've known
you since like first grade.

172
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:33,029
And you're always
so nice and so smart.

173
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:34,563
And you probably
don't know this,

174
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:37,432
but I used to copy your answers

Hahahaha.

177
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,702
Having you lean over my
left shoulder was the best thing

178
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,570
that ever happened to me in
the 5th grade.

179
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:46,406
Oh, ow.

180
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:47,940
Careful. Where does it hurt?

181
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:48,507
Oh, not there, a little lower.

182
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:49,941

183
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,142
Not there, a
little to the right.

00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:52,076
Here?

185
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:55,446
No, just a little bit lower.

186
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:56,530

Make you do things

225
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:19,077

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,646

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,016
I don't know, she
might be out of our league.

238
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:07,584
Oh, hell, no, not for Sharky.

239
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:08,918
Sharky's a man, he gets

240
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,688
more poontang than
Ellen De Generous.

241
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,290
All right, I'm going in.

242
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,938
If you're making a
salad, may I make a suggestion?

243
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,108
A suggestion?
Sure, babe, what is it?

244
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,943
You should try
the fresh zucchini,

245
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,812
rather than the cucumber.
It's an aphrodisiac.

246
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:44,683
Oh really? You
know, I really love zucchini.

247
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:45,917
Oh, now do you?

248
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,019
Do you know
what I like to do with a big,

249
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:51,155
fat, juicy zucchini
just like this one?

250
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh... What's that?

251
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:54,524
I like to take it in my hands.

252
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,811
Oh, that's nice.

253
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:59,096
And then I
take a big, nice, knife.

254
00:11:59,098 --> 00:11:59,996
What, a knife?

255
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:01,130
Oh, yeah.

256
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,232
Oh, whatcha
gonna do with the knife?

257
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:04,700
I'm gonna slice it up,

258
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,601
sautee it in butter, I
never thought about using a

259
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,669
zucchini in a salad before.

260
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,570
Hold on. If
I didn't know any better,

261
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,940
I'd think you were
coming on to me.

262
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,208
What? Me? Come on to you? No.

263
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,776
Oh, excuse me.

264
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,645
No, no. I'm just, no,
I'm saying, I was just gonna

265
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,047
ask a favor of you. Um.

266
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,115
Me and my friends were
trying to score some booze,

267
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,283
and I lost my ID.

268
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:28,884
You lost your ID?

269
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,619
Yeah. That's it.

270
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:31,920
How old are you, kid?

271
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,888
Oh, I'm of age. I promise you.

272
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,689
I mean, normally I wouldn't
even make a big deal about

273
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:36,790
something like this.

274
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,890
My friend, Beetle's

00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,817
Yeah. Hell, yeah. Yes.

351
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,351
All right, good, stop
acting like a little bitch.

352
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,269
I know, Beetle.

353
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,186
Oh, hey, and if she asks,

354
00:15:58,188 --> 00:16:00,488
you're shipping
off to Iraq tomorrow.

355
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,489
Cool?

356
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,392
Sir, yes sir.

357
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:07,294
Private Joker

358
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:08,328
Take off your clothes, Beetle.

359
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,862
I'm going, man.

360
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:11,730
Come on, just put your
legs through it, hurry up.

362
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,701
Oooh.

363
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,402
It's not like that, like this.

364
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:28,311
Close the door. Come on in.

365
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:33,381
That's right. Come to Mommy.
I won't bite.

00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:41,188
Unless you want me to.

367
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,893
Come on.

368
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:54,532
Mmm, you're gonna be a lot of
fun to play with...

Oh shit, he's gonna
get some sweet pupusa pie.

373
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,144
You'd better wear this.

374
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,345
I don't think so.

375
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:16,280
Sharky's a freeballer.
What a daredevil.

376
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:21,118
I thought you and
your friends wanted to have fun?

377
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,420
I guess I'll just have
to put my clothes back on.

378
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,854
Sharky, just put on the condom.

379
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:28,457
No, no, no wait.
Here, let me put it on.

YES!

We're running for

00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,060
He's gonna kill us.

Don't listen to them. These
guys are way out of line, Felicia.

00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,467
It was the Mafiosos. They
tried to jack us but we got away.

Oh my god Beetle, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

402
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,639
Yeah, but I
could use some pants.

I'll get you my dad's pants.
All right.

Nice bunny suit.

Wanna stroke
my leg for good luck?

Put them on.

00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:20,284

to screw my wife when i'm at work!

00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:32,126
Can I at least get a hot dog?
Ok. Ow.

414
00:19:32,928 --> 00:19:36,663
Can't believe it.

You guys realize that
once the story gets out,

418
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,143
I don't have to worry
about my senior year,

419
00:19:53,145 --> 00:19:55,078
'cos I won't be getting
laid 'til I'm a senior citizen.

420
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,015
You're just being dramatic.
Hey, where you going?

421
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,953
That's a good idea, Beetle.

422
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,587
I don't want to be a fricking
virgin for the rest of my life.

423
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:09,157
Look, relax, Beetle.
I got an idea.

424
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:10,958
All right, let's just get
off the street before anybody

425
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,695

later, all right?

426
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:19,164
Damn homie, you need
an extra-large, homes.

Mrs. Ortiz? I'm
looking for your son.

00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:31,575
Is this your son?

429
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:34,577
COP Oh.

430
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:39,414
Ma'am. I need you
to understand me.

00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,783
I'm looking for your son.

432
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:47,087
Your son is in big trouble.
He's a sexual predator.

433
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,372
Sexo?

434
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,656
Yes. Sexo, sexo.

435
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,457
I caught him and his buddies
trying to screw my wife.

436
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,293
He's a pervert.
Perverso, perverso.

437
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:04,302
COP No. No badge number. I'm
not looking for any trouble.

438
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:07,038
Just let your son know
that I'm looking for him.

439
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,545
Suck a key to you too, lady.

440
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:50,647
Benjamin?

441
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:52,682
Yes, Mommy.

442
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,227
I was working out.

443
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:07,394
No, Mom, stop.

444
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:10,530
Told you, I was out working out.
I'm trying out for wrestling

445
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,298
next year, and I got to
make the weight.

446
00:22:18,271 --> 00:22:19,470
The cops came here?

447
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:23,407
No, Mom, no problems.
Why did they come?

448
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:31,180
Huh. Mom, why
are you wearing that?

449
00:22:32,816 --> 00:22:34,649
How many times have I told
you, if you can't read English,

450
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,317
don't wear these shirts.

451
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:44,591
That's probably what
the cop was talking about, Mom.

452
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,359
Oh.

453
00:22:58,372 --> 00:23:00,105
Dang, I cant
play in these boots.

454
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:02,407
That's H-O-R for you, son.

455
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:03,508
Always knew
you were a big whore.

456
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,809
Screw you, buddy boy.

457
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,510
You ruined Easter
for me forever.

458
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,211
Hey, that cop
really go to your pad?

459
00:23:08,213 --> 00:23:11,214
Yeah. I guess he found
my ID in my pants or something.

460
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:13,016
Just a matter of time
before he busts me.

461
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,817
Busts you for what
that his wife's a nympho.

462
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:22,723
Worst thing he'll probably
do is whoop your ass.

463
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,524
Thanks, man.

464
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,792
The worst thing is that
those are my best pants.

465
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:28,360
I know, and my shoes?

466
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:29,694
Look at these raggedy-ass kicks.

467
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:31,462
How'm I suppose to
find girls wearing these?

468
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:32,663
Yo, relax.

469
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:34,398
Didn't I tell you
guys I got a plan?

470
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Your last plan
almost got us shot.

471
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:38,201
You know what, never mind, then.

472
00:23:38,203 --> 00:23:40,169
You guys are too immature
for this, anyway.

473
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:43,105
What are you talking about,
I could grow a mustache in 3 days.

474
00:23:43,107 --> 00:23:44,339
He gets it from his mother.

475
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,607
Whatever, dude.

476
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:46,874
You're just mad 'cos
you're hung like a toddler.

477
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,775
Shut up, puto, it's your shot.

478
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:51,677
Hey, and don't blame your
Banda boots this time.

479
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,178
Ha-ha.

480
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,379
Damn!

481
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,152
Look if we pull this off,
we're guaranteed to get laid, 100%.

482
00:24:03,154 --> 00:24:05,254
One hundred
percent - even Joker.

483
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,388
Even Joker.

484
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,122
Even me?

485
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:08,624
Hell, yeah.

486
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,125
Man, I hope you're
not talking about a hooker.

487
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:13,561
No, I'm not talking
about some common streetwalkers.

488
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:16,764
I'm talking about classy ladies
who know how to treat a man.

489
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:18,799
And where are we
supposed to find them?

490
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,835
You ever heard of a
place called Lola's Love Shack?

491
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:23,369
Man, that place ain't real.

492
00:24:23,371 --> 00:24:25,371
Yeah, I heard they closed
that place down years ago.

493
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:28,407
Not true, my brothers, not true.
The place went underground, but

494
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:31,443
it's still around. We just got to
figure out where they moved to.

495
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,344
And how we supposed to do that?

496
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:37,614
You know you guys
sound like a bunch of pussies right now?

497
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:39,849
Look, I'm telling you the place
is real, and it's

498
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,817
just waiting for us.

499
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:46,153
We just need some fake ID's and
we will be treated like kings.

500
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:47,855
Like kings?

501
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:49,556
Well, in your case,
like a dirty little princess.

502
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,658
Oh, you got me on
that one, Cotton Tail.

503
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,593
Well, how'd you
find out about this place?

504
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,461
You know, my brother
used to tell me about it.

505
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:57,262
Before he got sent
up to the Pinta.

506
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:58,730
You know, but all the old
men in the neighborhood here?

507
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:00,832
They know about it, but
they keep it hush-hush,

508
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,334
'cos they know it's
some sweet shit.

509
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:06,236
Look, I'm telling you virgins,
you want to become men?

510
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,672
This is the best way. But if you
want to keep playing pocket pool

511
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,907
and dreaming about Felicia, then
go right ahead.

512
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:17,544
Ha-ha-ha.

513
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:23,883
All right. I'm down with it.

514
00:25:24,352 --> 00:25:30,822
I'm in, too. Ok, guys,
this right here is for the ladies.

515
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:35,359
HORSE!

516
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:41,978
Oh, wait wait wait, Mafiosos.

517
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:43,433
Mafiosos. Here comes Trouble.

518
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:50,940
Oh man, yo guys, just be cool,
all right I'm gonna handle this.

519
00:25:50,942 --> 00:25:52,274
Hey, whassup, Trouble?

520
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:54,943
What's going on, little vatos.

521
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:55,643
Whatchu looking at?

522
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,544
Nothing.

523
00:25:58,613 --> 00:25:59,545
Let me talk to you
over here, little homie.

524
00:25:59,547 --> 00:26:02,447
All right.

525
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,215
I like your tattoo, man.

526
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:07,751
Man shut up, ain't
nobody talking to you. Shut up.

527
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:12,655
Yo, whassup, Trouble?

528
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,356
Why you hang around
with these fools anyway?

529
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:16,558
Oh, man, those
guys are like my brothers.

530
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,726
Your brothers? Look,
your brother was one of us,

531
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:22,596
all right, your real brother.
I heard you got jumped today.

532
00:26:22,598 --> 00:26:24,664
What? No, man,
I didn't get jumped.

533
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,466
Oh, really? I heard
you got your ass handed to you,

534
00:26:27,468 --> 00:26:30,435
and don't be insulting my
intelligence, all right?

535
00:26:30,437 --> 00:26:33,337
Who got your back? We do.
And if you ever need anything,

536
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:36,273
you give me a call, all right?
We got you.

537
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:38,608
Oh man that's cool. You
know but everything's handled man.

538
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,927
I'm straight.

539
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:43,245
Oh, really? Is that why you
got caught in your chonies today?

540
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,746
You know, it's real dangerous
out there, homie.

541
00:26:44,748 --> 00:26:47,281
You better think about it.

542
00:26:47,283 --> 00:26:49,416
Yeah. I mean,
yeah, you're right.

543
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,719
I am right. You take
care of yourself, all right?

544
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:54,487
Cool.

545
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,556
Stay away from them clowns, man.
They ain't no good.

546
00:26:57,558 --> 00:26:59,457
Yeah, aight.

547
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:00,791
They're no good.

548
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:03,527
Hey, homies,
let's roll out of here.

549
00:27:12,036 --> 00:27:13,668
What'd they want?

550
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,653
Oh, nothing, man.

551
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:17,637
They just... they just think
'cos my brother got jumped

552
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,439
into their gang, that I
will, too.

553
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:21,641
We got your back, bro.

554
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,909
Yeah, ok. All right, look.

555
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:25,911
So tomorrow, we get our
fake IDs if we're gonna

556
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,445
accomplish this mission.

557
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:31,015
They're gonna be $50 each. Cool?

558
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:33,283
Give me a sweet
poon-tang on three.

559
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:33,950
Three.

560
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,352
Sweet poon-tang.

561
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,057
You're late for rehearsal, Mijo.

562
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,591
I know, I'm sorry Pop.

563
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:46,660
And you're wearing your
Banda boots outside the house!

564
00:27:46,662 --> 00:27:50,596
You know they're
strictly for competition.

565
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:52,431
Now go get dressed, Mijo.

566
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:56,735
We got a big show at the swap
meet coming up.

567
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:04,575
It's about time. Ok, places
everyone.

568
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:09,012
Remember, focus. Smile.
Ok, how many counts was that?

569
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:18,387
5,6,7,8,5,6,7,8,5,6,7,8.

570
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:19,921
Turn.

571
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:21,389
And again.

572
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:46,832
MUSIC CONTINUES

573
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,604
PHONE RINGS

574
00:29:52,606 --> 00:30:00,010
Oh, shit. Felicia.

575
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:01,411
Hey, Beetle.

576
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,112
Hey.

577
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:08,083
Beetle, I am so sorry. I
just wanted to call to apologize.

578
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,184
What?

579
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:11,619
Sharky told me what you did.

580
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:12,486
He did?

581
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:13,620
Yep.

582
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:15,822
I think it's pretty cool.

583
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:19,892
And you're a good friend
to risk your life like that.

584
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:22,027
I am?

585
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,161
Yeah. He told me how you
waited outside when they went in, and

586
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:27,165
how you even tackled the cop
when he tried to shoot Sharky.

587
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:28,733
Sharky told you this?

588
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:31,001
Yeah. Why didn't you tell me?

589
00:30:31,003 --> 00:30:33,937
I didn't want to brag about it.

590
00:30:33,939 --> 00:30:37,640
Anyhow, I, I
just wanted to apologize.

591
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,675
Is there any way I
can make it up to you?

592
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:42,577
I don't know. It's pretty
jacked up, sending us out there wrapped

593
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,945
in foil like that.

594
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:46,580
I know. I'm so sorry.

595
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:47,948
Well, what are
you doing tomorrow?

596
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,883
Nothing.

597
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:52,185
You want to meet
up at the park tomorrow,

598
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:53,920
like you can bring
your friends if you want.

599
00:30:53,922 --> 00:30:55,488
Ok.

600
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,523
Uhhh... 3:30?

601
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,958
Ok. See you there.

602
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,928
Ok. Bye, Felicia.

603
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,064
Yes. Mom!

604
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,866
I need you to iron my
clothes real quick.

605
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:21,875
Ah, Vieja, You make
the best chili rellenos.

606
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:23,743
They're delicious, Mom.

607
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:27,213
Im glad you like them. Octavio?

608
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:31,716
You barely touched your food!
Is something wrong?

609
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:33,617
Well, I kind of have a problem.

610
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,518
What is it?

611
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,954
Well, I don't have any money.
I need like $50.

612
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:41,022
What do you need $50 for?

613
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,656
For a date.

614
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:46,859
$50 for a date?
What is wrong with you?

615
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,260
Can't you just take
her for a walk

616
00:31:48,262 --> 00:31:49,961
around the block or something?

617
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:51,495
A walk?

618
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:52,696
Calmate Viejo.

619
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,998
Girls, girls, girls.
When are you gonna learn?

620
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,201
Banda first, and the
girls will follow.

621
00:31:58,203 --> 00:32:03,839
How do you think I
got your mother?

622
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,508
Oye, Octavio.

623
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,643
I earned this money
on the lottery ticket.

624
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:13,881
I was gonna put this money in
the jar for our gazebo fund.

625
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:17,584
This is just one step closer
to building a gazebo in our

626
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:21,921
backyard, so we can play our
Banda music and have parties.

627
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,291
You know, great fun
for the whole family.

628
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:29,795
But if you think it's more
important to spend this money

629
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:34,532
on some girl, then you can be
selfish and take this money

630
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:37,101
for your date.

631
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:42,305
Son of a...

632
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:53,681
<i>Woke up in the morning
got me a warning.</i>

633
00:32:53,683 --> 00:32:55,949
<i>Mama say you better
not get in trouble.</i>

634
00:32:55,951 --> 00:32:58,084
<i>It's a nice summer day
but if you go astray.</i>

635
00:32:58,086 --> 00:33:00,219
<i>I'm gonna have to come
bust your bubble</i>

636
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:05,190
<i>but I'm out the door
I got no time to hear it.</i>

637
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:10,862
<i>I'm out the door to where my
troubles can't find me no more.</i>

638
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:24,006
<i>I know you think you've got all
the</i>

639
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:28,643
<i>they ain't on the corner with
my homeboys goin' to nowhere.</i>

640
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:33,114
<i>Walked down the street? What did I see?
The homies were writing graffiti.</i>

641
00:33:33,116 --> 00:33:37,317
<i>Colors so sweet on the hot concrete
could'a' sworn I was still dreaming</i>

642
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,987
<i>and I'm feeling high like
my feet have left the ground.</i>

643
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:47,224
<i>Feel like I can fly and leave
the world behind.</i>

644
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:51,828
<i>Guitar solo.</i>

645
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:44,813
Damn, that sucked.

646
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,214
Man, I can't believe
you trusted that cholo.

647
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:47,915
He took the last of my bus fare.

648
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:49,116
We're screwed now.

649
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:51,351
Maybe we're just not
meant to have fake IDs.

650
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,853
Maybe we just have to rely
on our natural abilities

651
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:56,188
in order to compete in
the sexual food chain.

652
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:59,791
Man, you watch
so much nature channel.

653
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,359
Boys!

654
00:35:01,361 --> 00:35:07,464
'Sup?

655
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:10,733
'Sup Paletas?

656
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:13,969
You know, I've been
watching you boys for a while now.

657
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:16,104
Let me ask you something.

658
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:19,707
Why are you guys so desperate to
get these IDs, huh?

659
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:22,242
It's a long story.

660
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:23,743
Our friend,
Beetle, here is a virgin.

661
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:25,211
Oh, I see.

662
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:26,678
And we need to take
him to Lola's Love Shack to

663
00:35:26,681 --> 00:35:28,414
get his old sour cherry popped.

664
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:33,752
Lola's Love Shack.
Yup. That's where I found my 1st amor.

665
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:39,190
Yeah, she gave me
the gift of love.

666
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,826
But anyway, that's
what the doctor said.

667
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:45,161
Lola's is just
a dream for us now.

668
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:49,231
Let me see, now. I
hate to see three fine young boys like

669
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:53,168
you guys go out without love.
You know what?

670
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,270
I'm gonna hook you guys up.

671
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:57,539
Hook us up with what?

672
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,807
Fake ID's, stupid.
What do you think-I sell ice cream?

673
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,441
Pendejo

674
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:04,210
I got to make a living somehow,
buddy. You know what I mean?

675
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:10,382
All right, first, we
need to get some pictures.

676
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:12,917
Wait, we just got robbed,
though, we don't have any money.

677
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:14,852
Hey, y'all hold up, Beetle.

678
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:19,989
I like to keep my money where
no one will look for it.

679
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,490
But I thought
he got your wallet?

680
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:24,860
No, man, I just keep a
couple of bucks in there as a decoy.

681
00:36:24,862 --> 00:36:26,361
But I like to keep my big
piggy bank tucked

682
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:29,330
right underneath my ball sac.

683
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:32,733
It's a little sweaty, but
it's just the top layer.

684
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:34,434
Boy, that is disgusting.

685
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:37,003
Lucky for you, I'm a romantic.

686
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:39,505
So I'll take the cash
for the pictures.

687
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:42,841
Hell yeah.

688
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:47,345
Back up, back up. All right.

689
00:36:47,347 --> 00:36:49,080
Just gonna get some
pictures over here.

690
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,098
Who's first?

691
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,115
Beetle.

692
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:53,283
All right, buddy.

693
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:54,384
Uh, listen, don't look so
serious,

694
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:55,785
you look like a refugee.

695
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:58,154
Smile a little bit.
There you go.

696
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:03,358
Damn, these look real.

697
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,860
Mine says Chase P. Nocha.

698
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:07,845
What name did you use?

699
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:09,829
Oliver Coochie, coz
that's all I'm gonna settle for.

700
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:11,765
And I'm Sal T. Huevos.

701
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,032
That means I got the cojones.

702
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,000
Sounds more like you
gotta air out your nuts.

703
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:16,334
Man, look who's talking!

704
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:18,402
I can't believe that
guy even took your money.

705
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,871
You nasty.

706
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:22,105
Guys, will these IDs even work?

707
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:25,274
There's only
one way to find out.

708
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:34,348
Hey, there's Lucy Loose Lips.

709
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,049
I heard they call her
that 'cos she talks so much.

710
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:37,634
Dude, you're an idiot.

711
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,218
They call her that because she
blew the entire wrestling team.

712
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,552
Dumb ass.

713
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:42,186
What do we do, Sharky?

714
00:37:42,188 --> 00:37:44,154
All right, Beetle,
looks like you're up to bat.

715
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,922
Go see if she wants to
have some drinks with us.

716
00:37:45,924 --> 00:37:47,423
Hey, why do you
always send this fool first?

717
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:48,524
I got more game than him.

718
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,025
Not even, fool.

719
00:37:50,027 --> 00:37:51,259
Dude, he's never gotten any.

720
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:52,460
You said you ain't a virgin.

721
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:54,528
Oh, yeah.

722
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,197
Let the virgin go first.

723
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:04,970
Hey, Sharky.

724
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,271
Yo, what's up?

725
00:38:06,273 --> 00:38:08,506
What does it
feel like to get laid?

726
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:10,474
You, too, huh?

727
00:38:10,476 --> 00:38:12,042
I knew it, fool.

728
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:14,811
Watch and learn.

729
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:20,315
Jonas Brothers,
they're pretty good.

730
00:38:20,317 --> 00:38:24,818
Are you into them or what?

731
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,985
All right, you know what?

732
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,052
Forget you, then.

733
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,486
The Jonas Brothers...

734
00:38:28,488 --> 00:38:30,254
they should be called The Bone
Us Brothers, 'cos they

735
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:34,258
look like they want it up the
butt from an escaped convict.

736
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,961
Sorry, I couldn't hear.
Were you saying something?

737
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:39,996
Oh, the Jonas Brothers.

738
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:41,597
I'm nuts for them,
like an escaped convict,

739
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,399
I love them.

740
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
Oh, yeah? I love, love,
love the Jonas Brothers.

741
00:38:45,202 --> 00:38:46,601
Lucy, I'm
Beetle, and I was just.

742
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:48,135
You know my name?

743
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:49,836
Yeah, we go to
the same high school.

744
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:51,421
We do?

745
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:53,005
Yeah, it's cool. I mean,
well, I was just wondering

746
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:54,473
if you wanted to have a drink
with me and my friends?

747
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:56,174
You guys can score?

748
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,608
Hell, yeah. I've got an ID.

749
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,509
My god, can you
get me Booze Farms?

750
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:01,561
Yeah, sure.

751
00:39:01,562 --> 00:39:03,612
I love Booze Farms.
Once, I drank a whole bottle

752
00:39:03,615 --> 00:39:05,381
and totally passed out.

753
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:07,015
And I wasn't even
hung over the next day.

754
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:09,050
I'm impressed. That's awesome.

755
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:10,618
I think it's
because we mixed it.

756
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,154
They got cranberry, mixed it
with grape. They call it crape.

757
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:16,556
But you don't have to get both,
just grape is fine.

758
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:17,356
Ok.

759
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:18,523
Do you like grape?

760
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:21,325
Yeah. I'll be right back, ok?

761
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:22,571
Ok.

762
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:23,816
All right.

763
00:39:23,817 --> 00:39:25,061
Hey. It was really
good running into you.

764
00:39:25,064 --> 00:39:28,498
Yeah.

765
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,903
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

766
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:38,440
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
- Here you go.

767
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:42,609
Oliver Coochie?

768
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:45,078
It's pronounced Kee-yoo-chee.

769
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,913
Ky-oochie?

770
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,481
Q-Chee.

771
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:50,149
Coo-Chee.

772
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,050
Q-cheeee.

773
00:39:52,052 --> 00:39:53,384
Coochie.

774
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:54,618
Coochie.

775
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,152
Coochie.

776
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:59,121
Yeah, that's it. Kewchi.

777
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:02,023
Coochie.

778
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,959
That'll be twelve dollars.

779
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:08,028
It should all be in there.

780
00:40:16,504 --> 00:40:17,436
Thank you.

781
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:18,369
Have a good day, Mr. Coochie.

782
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:20,338
Yeah, you too.

783
00:42:18,324 --> 00:42:20,490
If you guys want
to have sex with me,

784
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:22,558
you have to wear a rubber.

785
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,761
And one at a time, ok?
I'm not a skank.

786
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:33,734
Huddle.

787
00:42:33,736 --> 00:42:37,270
I don't know, guys.
I wouldn't touch it.

788
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:39,272
If I were you, I wouldn't
touch it either.

789
00:42:39,274 --> 00:42:40,773
Yeah, I'm gonna
wait 'til Felicia gets here.

790
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:44,109
Oh, she's coming here man?
She bringing her friends?

791
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,778
I don't give a damn. I'm
gonna go for it right now,.

792
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,247
Damn, fool, you
don't even have a condom.

793
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:54,418
What you think I'm an idiot?

794
00:42:57,523 --> 00:43:01,358
Dumb ass, this is a wet nap.

795
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,294
Come on you guys, are
we gonna screw or what?

796
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:05,561
Hold on one second.

797
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:10,165
I don't care,
I'm going for it. Move.

798
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,250
Come here. Show me
what you're working with.

799
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:33,519
No, you take off your top first.

800
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:35,921
Ok.

801
00:43:41,728 --> 00:43:43,794
Don't be shy Joker.

802
00:43:43,796 --> 00:43:45,462
Just go to sleep.

803
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:48,398
Awwwe...

804
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:55,370
My head it spinning.

805
00:43:55,372 --> 00:43:56,537
You all right?

806
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:59,139
Oh.

807
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:02,642
Screwed up with the coach, man.

808
00:44:02,644 --> 00:44:07,145
So what, man? Screw that guy.

809
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:14,385
Yeah, screw him, Screw
me, screw everybody. I'm screwed.

810
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:17,354
Ah Sharky, it's just a game man,

811
00:44:17,356 --> 00:44:18,722
It's just a game, buddy.

812
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,490
Man, get off me, man.

813
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,725
Just a game.

814
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,625
Hey, what time is it?

815
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,160
It's like 3:30.

816
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:26,694
Oh shit, she's
gonna be here, soon, dude.

817
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:27,695
Right on, dog.

818
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:29,396
Hey, what about Joker?

819
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:31,731
Well, what about him? Leave him.

820
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:32,865
Yo man, we got to stop him.

821
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:34,111
No, man.

822
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:35,356
I gotta stop him, man.

823
00:44:35,357 --> 00:44:36,601
He's cool, man, he's cool.

824
00:44:36,604 --> 00:44:44,909
Wait. Joker, you better
rethink this, man. Joker, Joker. Hey.

825
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:46,577
Hey, you better put your
pants on, big boy.

826
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:49,880
Your date's passed out.

827
00:44:49,882 --> 00:44:51,748
What are you doing, dick head?

828
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,484
You trying to pull my pants on,
I'll pull your pants down.

829
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:56,385
I'm trying to put
your pants back on, look.

830
00:44:56,387 --> 00:44:57,886
Your date's passed out, and
you're about to bone her

831
00:44:57,888 --> 00:44:58,920
with a wet nap.

832
00:44:58,922 --> 00:45:01,622
Oh, shit, Beetle. You saved me.

833
00:45:01,624 --> 00:45:06,225
I love you. You're my favorite
homie.

834
00:45:06,227 --> 00:45:08,660
Yeah, I'm your favorite?

835
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:10,928
Oh, you saved me from
making a terrible mistake,

836
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,897
Beetle. My chorizo could
have dried up,

837
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:16,332
shriveled away or something.

838
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:18,200
Yeah. You need
to get up, though.

839
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:19,017
No, no.

840
00:45:19,018 --> 00:45:19,833
You should get dressed, man.

841
00:45:19,836 --> 00:45:21,802
My pants are down.

842
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:24,404
Oh, my god.

843
00:45:24,406 --> 00:45:28,508
You are a pervert.
Have fun with your tramp.

844
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,643
Wait, Felicia. It's not
what it looks like, I promise you.

845
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,945
I'm just tired of your stories.

846
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:34,613
You're just a complete dog.

847
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:37,582
Oh. Beetle.

848
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:51,228
Well, I guess that does it.
Felicia will never

849
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,264
ever talk to me again.

850
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:57,967
Forget about Felicia.

851
00:45:57,969 --> 00:45:59,335
Forget about Felicia.

852
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:00,920
I don't want to.

853
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:02,504
There's plenty of
ho's out there, Beetle.

854
00:46:02,506 --> 00:46:04,339
Look, at least our ID's worked.

855
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:05,773
Now we can get into Lola's.

856
00:46:05,775 --> 00:46:07,741
How are we gonna
get the money for that?

857
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:12,411
I don't know. But
we're gonna roll up in style.

858
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:13,378
Hey guys, I feel better now,

859
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,480
I puked it all out.
I feel great.

860
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,814
Your breath
smells like Lucy's ass.

861
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,448
So what, your breath
smells like Hobo Dick.

862
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:25,488
Ok, ladies. I got
something to show you.

863
00:46:33,464 --> 00:46:35,863
Check it out.

864
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:41,401
Damn, this is nice.

865
00:46:41,403 --> 00:46:42,969
That is bad ass, Sharky.

866
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:46,705
Yeah, it's my brother's.
I mean, he ain't using it.

867
00:46:46,707 --> 00:46:49,340
Needs a little work.

868
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:54,411
Yeah, we fix this up, we're
gonna get the royal treatment.

869
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:55,812
I'm sorry I
ever doubted you, man.

870
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:58,381
This is bad-ass. We're gonna
get laid for sure now.

871
00:46:58,383 --> 00:46:59,749
So. The faith is back?

872
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:04,386
Hell yeah. Hey,
I just got an idea.

873
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,388
I know how we can get the
money to fix up the car

874
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,689
and go to Lola's Love Shack.

875
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,023
How we gonna get
that kind of money?

876
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:10,891
What are you
talking about dumb ass?

877
00:47:10,893 --> 00:47:12,926
This is the land of opportunity.

878
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:15,295
In this country, if you want
something, you get it.

879
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:16,763
Doesn't matter if you're short,

880
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:19,832
fat, skinny, white,
brown, black.

881
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,466
Legal or illegal.

882
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:22,834
If you want something,
you get it.

883
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:26,370
You want to get laid?
No, we will get laid.

884
00:47:26,372 --> 00:47:28,038
We will go to Lola's
Love Shack tomorrow.

885
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,540
Are you serious?

886
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:31,041
You guys should be
at my place at 5AM tomorrow,

887
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:32,776
bring some work clothes.

888
00:47:32,778 --> 00:47:36,079
Get ready to live
the American Dream.

889
00:47:47,692 --> 00:47:49,058
This ain't no American dream.

890
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,893
It's more like a
Mexican nightmare.

891
00:47:50,895 --> 00:47:53,028
Hey, hey. Whatever
buys a dream, buddy. Right?

892
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,695
Simone.

893
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,596
All right.

894
00:47:55,598 --> 00:47:57,581
Right. Right here, right
here, right here.

895
00:47:57,582 --> 00:47:59,565
Hey, guys. I need ten
guys, fifty bucks a day,

896
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:01,000
anybody here speak English?

897
00:48:01,002 --> 00:48:02,701
I do, Senior.
Me speak-a the English.

898
00:48:02,703 --> 00:48:05,637
All right. Do me a favor, ask
these guys if any of them have

899
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:07,872
any experience with
demolition and clean-up?

900
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:08,739
Ok, yeah, yeah.

901
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:14,609
So sorry Senior.

902
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,912
What's he saying?

903
00:48:17,914 --> 00:48:19,513
He needs higher wages.

904
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:22,382
Higher wages?
Are you shitting me?

905
00:48:22,384 --> 00:48:24,450
All right, I'll tell you
what, tell 'em $70

906
00:48:24,452 --> 00:48:25,717
is as high as I can go.

907
00:48:30,756 --> 00:48:31,921
He wants a hundred.

908
00:48:31,923 --> 00:48:33,422
A hundred?

909
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:36,265
Senior, trust me.
We work twice as hard.

910
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,458
We get the job done.

911
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,093
All right, load 'em up.

912
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:54,472
All right, everyone's getting
their seat belts on?

913
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:46,788
MUSIC OUT

914
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,091
All right, man, great job today.
You really earned this.

915
00:49:51,093 --> 00:49:51,991
Here you are.

916
00:49:51,993 --> 00:49:54,927
Thank you, sir.

917
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:56,128
Good work.

918
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,596
Thank you.

919
00:49:57,598 --> 00:50:02,233
Great job.

920
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:10,073
Got to hand it to you, Beetle.
You're a clever man.

921
00:50:10,075 --> 00:50:11,474
I think I'll be a sports agent

922
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:12,641
and negotiate your
contracts for you.

923
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,009
Sh, you're hired, homie.

924
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,677
Now I can afford
a new silk shirt.

925
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,979
Now you can afford
to get some boxers and shit.

926
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,680
Get rid of those
banana hammocks.

927
00:50:19,682 --> 00:50:21,048
So what? At least
I can fill them up.

928
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,416
You can't fill
up a peanut shell.

929
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:23,850
Shut up, fool.

930
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:29,788
No, no, no it's all good.

931
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,856
Thank you friend, thank you.

932
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:35,559
Hey man. You
know what you did for us?

933
00:50:35,561 --> 00:50:37,827
Any time you need
us, you call me, ok?

934
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:39,995
Ok.

935
00:50:39,997 --> 00:50:41,796
Gracias. Gracias.

936
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,570
That guy likes you.

937
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:53,940
Lola's Love Shack, here we go.

938
00:50:53,942 --> 00:50:55,274
Oh, let's roll.

939
00:50:58,178 --> 00:51:00,945
I'm gonna go to her
and tell her like this.

940
00:51:00,947 --> 00:51:03,580
I want you to go
down on me, girl.

941
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,782
I want you to do me right.

942
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:08,851
Then, I'm gonna put it in
her grill and I'm like oh,

943
00:51:08,853 --> 00:51:12,854
yeah, oh, yeah.

944
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:16,991
Oh God, I'm coming, I'm
coming. Oh.

945
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:21,895
Hey, you morons stop playing
around while I'm down there?

946
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:25,932
All right, well, that's it.
Beetle, fire it up.

947
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,505
Hey. Let's go tonight.

948
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,708
How much we got?

949
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,509
This much.

950
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:41,111
Ok, that won't get us
a midget's nipple at Lola's.

951
00:51:41,113 --> 00:51:43,079
You know what, guys?
You guys stepped up.

952
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:46,549
So now it's time for me to step
it up, too. Trust me, guys.

953
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:47,983
I know where to get the money.

954
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,151
Tomorrow, we'll be Don Juans,

955
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:53,954
because we're gonna do it
'til they don juan no more.

956
00:51:53,956 --> 00:51:55,722
All right, just
don't say that to the girls,

957
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:58,257
all right, man? Hey, man.
I'm just telling you.

958
00:51:58,259 --> 00:51:59,658
All right, ladies.

959
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,827
So go home, get some
rest, for tomorrow,

960
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,129
you will be men.

961
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:07,764
Sweet poon-tang on
three right here.

962
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:08,598
Three.

963
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,633
Sweet Poon-tang.

964
00:54:04,314 --> 00:54:09,083
Sharky. Whassup, doggie?

965
00:54:09,085 --> 00:54:12,820
'Sup, dog?

966
00:54:12,822 --> 00:54:15,022
What are you all dressed up for?

967
00:54:15,024 --> 00:54:16,824
I want to look presentable.

968
00:54:16,825 --> 00:54:18,625
You look like
you're going to a funeral.

969
00:54:18,627 --> 00:54:21,160
Ha-ha, looks like Los Tigres
Del Norte puked on your shirt.

970
00:54:21,162 --> 00:54:23,328
The women love this look.
It's silk, see how soft it is?

971
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,263
Get off me. That is pretty soft.

972
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:31,335
Ok, you ladies look
very pretty tonight. Let's roll.

973
00:54:31,337 --> 00:54:33,003
Let's represent, Homies.

974
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:43,113
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

975
00:54:43,115 --> 00:54:53,123
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

976
00:54:53,125 --> 00:55:03,133
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

977
00:55:03,135 --> 00:55:17,146
Whoo-hoo, Lola's Love Shack.

978
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:21,183
Woo hoo! Here we come!

979
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,355
Looks like there's nothing here.

980
00:55:28,357 --> 00:55:30,890
Are you sure you
got the right directions?

981
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:34,193
Look, it's underground.
It's not supposed to be seen.

982
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:38,029
The guy said it was around here.

983
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:41,265
Look. Door. Beetle. Knock.

984
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:43,133
I'm not gonna knock.
You go knock.

985
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:47,269
Joker, knock.

986
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:49,871
Wait, and what do I say?

987
00:55:49,873 --> 00:55:51,706
Just tell him like
the man said, you got a

988
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:54,241
message for Lola, right?

989
00:55:54,243 --> 00:56:00,380
All right, here goes nothing.

990
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:02,180
Who is it?

991
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,882
I got a message for Lola?

992
00:56:04,884 --> 00:56:06,483
Yeah, what's the message?

993
00:56:06,485 --> 00:56:09,719
I got to tell her personally.

994
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:12,488
Go away kid,
there's no Lola here.

995
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,240
Oop, she's not here, let's go.

996
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:15,991
Oh, oh, oh, wait, hold on.
We worked way too hard to get here.

997
00:56:15,993 --> 00:56:17,025
We can't just leave now.

998
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:20,294
It's the wrong place.

999
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:21,828
Good night, Mr. Morales.

1000
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,063
See you tomorrow night, Joey.

1001
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:25,798
Hey, it's Paletas. Hey Paletas!

1002
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,551
MR, RALPH: Hey, hey, who's that?

1003
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,303
What's up? Remember us?
You told us about this place.

1004
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:35,273
Oh my god.
It's the blue balls crew!

1005
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:36,474
How are you, boys?

1006
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,209
Hey, congratulations.
You found the place, huh?

1007
00:56:38,211 --> 00:56:41,512
Yeah, we found it,
but he won't let us in.

1008
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:43,947
Well, did you tell him
that you had a message for Lola?

1009
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:45,381
Yeah, I told him that.

1010
00:56:45,383 --> 00:56:48,751
And did you mention
that Benjamin Franklin

1011
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,119
wanted to talk to her?

1012
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:52,788
No.

1013
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:59,994
MR, RALPH: Pandejos. Boys.
A little money goes a long way, huh?

1014
00:56:59,996 --> 00:57:02,763
Come on, snap out of it.
Look, I got to go.

1015
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,965
Lola doesn't like crowds hanging
around the place, hey?

1016
00:57:04,967 --> 00:57:08,001
Good luck. Get laid.

1017
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:09,369
Thanks, man.

1018
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:12,605
All right. You heard the man.
Let's get inside.

1019
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:19,144
Knock, buey.

1020
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,453
You again?

1021
00:57:29,455 --> 00:57:31,922
Yeah, we have
a message for Lola.

1022
00:57:31,924 --> 00:57:34,324
From Benjamin Franklin.

1023
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:37,827
Well, what is it?

1024
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,996
I got a boner
that needs your guidance.

1025
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:44,165
You little punk.
I'm gonna bash your face in.

1026
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:47,168
Hey, what he meant to
say is that he wants to tip you.

1027
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,235
Generously.

1028
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,239
You better cool
it with the smart-ass shit.

1029
00:57:54,241 --> 00:58:03,548
You got me? Come on.
Ok, this is how it's gonna go.

1030
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,851
You're gonna go up there through
those doors and see Lola.

1031
00:58:06,853 --> 00:58:09,553
You do exactly what
she tells you to do.

1032
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:14,156
She will introduce - don't touch
that. Don't touch anything.

1033
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:18,059
All right. And then she'll
introduce you to the girls.

1034
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,860
You boys are over 18, right?

1035
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:21,027
Of course we are.

1036
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:22,094
Yeah, yeah,
show me your ID, my man.

1037
00:58:22,096 --> 00:58:30,936
I'm 23, though.

1038
00:58:30,938 --> 00:58:33,438
Uh, yeah, I'm
gonna hang onto these.

1039
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,406
You can pick 'em
up on the way out.

1040
00:58:34,407 --> 00:58:35,373
You got it, boss.

1041
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:40,010
Go upstairs. Go.

1042
00:58:49,887 --> 00:58:57,058
Don't touch nothing,
you little shits.

1043
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:09,369
This is weird.

1044
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:11,537
This is not how I imagined it.

1045
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:18,176
Where are the girls?

1046
00:59:18,178 --> 00:59:22,280
Somebody has a message for me?

1047
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:28,118
Yeah. I have a boner
that needs your guidance.

1048
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,053
Well, you boys got money?

1049
00:59:30,055 --> 00:59:31,954
Sure do.

1050
00:59:31,956 --> 00:59:39,127
Put it on the table.
What do you want?

1051
00:59:39,129 --> 00:59:40,962
We want to meet
some of your girls.

1052
00:59:40,964 --> 00:59:43,898
Well, you found the place.
And you got in.

1053
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,034
But I mean, I don't
know who sent you.

1054
00:59:47,036 --> 00:59:52,172
So I'm gonna have to
do a test. Drop your pants.

1055
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:54,674
I don't know lady, we
put the money on the table.

1056
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:56,142
We just want to meet the girls.

1057
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:59,044
You either drop your pants,
or you go back home to your mamas.

1058
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:04,149
All right. Fine.
Let's just do it, guys.

1059
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:14,124
Oh, ok. Not bad.

1060
01:00:14,126 --> 01:00:18,328
That tickles.

1061
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:24,033
Oh, very impressive.

1062
01:00:24,035 --> 01:00:24,933
Thank you.

1063
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,567
And even a haircut.

1064
01:00:26,569 --> 01:00:28,702
Thank you.

1065
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:37,942
Can you lift up your stomach?

1066
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:41,111
What do you think you're
gonna do with that?

1067
01:00:41,113 --> 01:00:44,581
I'm a grower, not a show-er.

1068
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:49,485
I'm sorry, sonny.
Even my girls have standards.

1069
01:00:49,487 --> 01:00:51,987
Come on, lady. We didn't
come here to get insulted.

1070
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:54,122
We just want to meet
some of your girls.

1071
01:00:54,124 --> 01:01:01,362
All right. Buddy.
You got it. Chicas.

1072
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:42,768
Sharky, what do you want to do?

1073
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:46,138
I don't know, pick one.

1074
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,406
All right. Uhm I'll
take that one on the right.

1075
01:01:48,408 --> 01:01:50,508
That's the one I wanted.

1076
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:52,042
Fine, I'll pick another one.

1077
01:01:52,044 --> 01:01:53,777
Well, we can share
if you want, Beetle.

1078
01:01:53,779 --> 01:01:54,744
Get off of me.

1079
01:01:54,746 --> 01:01:56,145
I want to remember
this as a good time,

1080
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,346
not be scarred for life.

1081
01:01:57,348 --> 01:01:59,181
Fine, then which
one do you choose?

1082
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,683
I'll take her.

1083
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:07,754
I don't know which one to pick.
My leg's shaking. Uhm.

1084
01:02:07,756 --> 01:02:11,257
We're gonna have a
two-for-one special tonight.

1085
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:17,629
Now, these girls are identical
in every way. Except one.

1086
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:21,766
Two for one? Oh my God I
love this place. I'll take them.

1087
01:02:21,768 --> 01:02:29,640
Hey, Mina, Cherry, twins,
show these men to the back room.

1088
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:42,151
Can I ask you a question?

1089
01:02:42,153 --> 01:02:43,318
Sure.

1090
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,486
Do you like my boobs?

1091
01:02:45,488 --> 01:02:48,288
I think it's cute how they
point in different directions.

1092
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:52,358
Do they feel natural?

1093
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,659
They feel great.

1094
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:59,497
Oh. So cute.

1095
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:04,567
Hmmm. Oh, ladies, I'm
going to do things to you

1096
01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:06,769
you've never had done before.

1097
01:03:06,771 --> 01:03:14,509
Oh, you mean you're gonna.

1098
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:19,546
Um. No. Not that.

1099
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:22,615
You mean you're
gonna pay us double?

1100
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:25,718
Not that, either... Yeah...

1101
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,286
You're beautiful.

1102
01:03:27,288 --> 01:03:31,332
Oh, thanks. I
really like your shirt.

1103
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:32,590
It's so soft.

1104
01:03:32,592 --> 01:03:34,525
Look. I got you something.

1105
01:03:34,527 --> 01:03:35,425
Oh. What?

1106
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:38,227
It comes from a clam.

1107
01:03:38,229 --> 01:03:39,828
I think you mean oyster.

1108
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:42,397
Really?

1109
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:48,469
Thanks. But you shouldn't have.

1110
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:51,271
Sharky said you'll
love a pearl necklace.

1111
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:59,178
Oh. You're so cute.
But you really shouldn't be here.

1112
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,481
No, I really like you. It's just
you really should be going.

1113
01:04:03,483 --> 01:04:05,783
It's Lola.

1114
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,218
What was that?

1115
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,186
That means we gotta go.

1116
01:04:10,188 --> 01:04:12,454
But we'll be right back.
So get ready for us, ok?

1117
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:15,423
Ok, I'm ready.

1118
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:18,793
Oh, man, I get two of them.

1119
01:04:18,795 --> 01:04:22,530
Oh, my God, she loves my shirt.
She gave me her number.

1120
01:04:22,532 --> 01:04:24,231
I'm starting
to get nervous, guys.

1121
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:25,465
What, nervous? What for?

1122
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:28,234
Just do whatever comes natural.

1123
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:31,136
Whassup, homie?
Whoa. Hey, man, get off me.

1124
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:43,879
And I better not catch
you jag-offs back here again.

1125
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,580
Man, open this door.

1126
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,716
Come on, man,
let's get out of here.

1127
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:51,851
Man, get off me, man.
Open this door. Get off me!

1128
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,521
I'll burn this place down.

1129
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,622
Come on.

1130
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:57,323
Mina.

1131
01:04:57,325 --> 01:04:59,391
Come on.

1132
01:05:03,396 --> 01:05:08,431
Man, I'm never
gonna see Mina again.

1133
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:11,467
Man, that was some bullshit.

1134
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:13,402
You know, she never would
have played us like that if

1135
01:05:13,404 --> 01:05:15,737
we were rolling
with the Mafiosos.

1136
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:19,741
What a dumb ass move, man.
Can't believe I even listen to you.

1137
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:21,542
Well, maybe I'm not
as smart as you, Beetle.

1138
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:23,944
Get off me.

1139
01:05:23,946 --> 01:05:28,380
Oh, shit, here
comes your stepdad.

1140
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,782
Where the hell
did you go tonight?

1141
01:05:30,784 --> 01:05:32,683
What's it to you?

1142
01:05:32,685 --> 01:05:36,620
What's it to me?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

1143
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:39,222
You think you can just go out
and do what you want, huh?

1144
01:05:39,224 --> 01:05:40,723
Yeah, that's right.

1145
01:05:40,725 --> 01:05:42,758
Yeah, and now that
you fixed your brother's car,

1146
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:47,395
you can go out cruising
and be like him?

1147
01:05:47,397 --> 01:05:48,796
I'm not like him, John.

1148
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,199
You're a liar, Danny.
Your mother got a call today.

1149
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:59,272
They said that you were kicked
off the team for drinking.

1150
01:05:59,274 --> 01:06:01,240
You're a loser.

1151
01:06:01,242 --> 01:06:03,542
You're gonna end up
in prison like Hector.

1152
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,844
Why don't you shut your mouth?

1153
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:08,580
Oh, you think you're
bad now, huh? You think -

1154
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:10,648
Come on! Come on!

1155
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:16,386
You little punk.

1156
01:06:25,964 --> 01:06:30,666
Mr. Alba? You think
we could get a ride home now?

1157
01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:50,484
Octavio, get
over here right now.

1158
01:06:56,657 --> 01:06:58,857
Where is the gazebo money?

1159
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:00,758
Somebody stole it?

1160
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,495
I found this in his pocket.

1161
01:07:04,497 --> 01:07:08,998
You're kidding me? You spent
the gazebo fund on hookers?

1162
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,599
How do you know it's hookers?

1163
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:13,368
Never mind how I know.
This is about Octavio.

1164
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:17,972
Look how upset you made
your mother. Now sit down.

1165
01:07:17,974 --> 01:07:20,341
That's Sharky's.

1166
01:07:20,343 --> 01:07:22,710
Que cochino, Octavio.

1167
01:07:22,712 --> 01:07:25,479
Yeah, you like hookers.
You're a cochino.

1168
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:26,580
Shut up.

1169
01:07:26,582 --> 01:07:28,782
Go to your room.

1170
01:07:28,784 --> 01:07:31,017
The entire family
is disappointed in you.

1171
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:33,352
You have been
selfish and thoughtless.

1172
01:07:33,354 --> 01:07:35,320
And a cochino.

1173
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:36,621
And a cochino.

1174
01:07:36,623 --> 01:07:40,024
We are seriously considering
putting you up for adoption.

1175
01:07:40,026 --> 01:07:42,593
Now get out of our
faces and get to your room.

1176
01:07:42,595 --> 01:07:45,429
You are officially
out of the Banda.

1177
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:54,037
Hey, Felicia. Hello, Felicia.
Hello. Hi. Yo. Yo, Felicia.

1178
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:57,407
Look, about this pervert stuff.

1179
01:07:57,409 --> 01:08:03,011
Hi, Felicia. You know I'm not
really a pervert, right?

1180
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:06,414
I am not a pervert, Felicia.
I am not a pervert.

1181
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:19,492
Oh
My god baby, it feels so good!

1182
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:21,494
Oh my god, It's so big.

1183
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:22,962
I know.

1184
01:08:22,964 --> 01:08:30,802
It scares me.

1185
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:32,921
No way.

1186
01:08:32,922 --> 01:08:35,039
What the hell? Beetle.
What's wrong with you?

1187
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:36,940
Wait a minute, I
came here today to apologize,

1188
01:08:36,942 --> 01:08:40,476
and you're all watching a porno.
I'm the pervert?

1189
01:08:40,478 --> 01:08:42,644
Would it be fair if I called
y'all a bunch of sluts?

1190
01:08:42,646 --> 01:08:43,878
You're not
gonna come into my house

1191
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,845
and call me a slut.

1192
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:46,146
You must be tripping.

1193
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:47,446
Felicia, you just gonna
let him get away with it?

1194
01:08:47,447 --> 01:08:48,746
Wait a minute.
Let's hear him out.

1195
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,816
Look, Felicia. I
know the way things are don't

1196
01:08:50,818 --> 01:08:52,350
make me look too good.

1197
01:08:52,352 --> 01:08:57,087
These are for you. Please.
Felicia. Honestly,

1198
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:59,022
all I ever wanted was to
get to know you better.

1199
01:08:59,024 --> 01:09:01,724
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever known,

1200
01:09:01,726 --> 01:09:03,358
and I swear if you
give me just one,

1201
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:07,761
just one more chance, I'll
never do you wrong again.

1202
01:09:07,763 --> 01:09:10,029
What about Lucy Loose Lips?

1203
01:09:10,031 --> 01:09:12,798
What about Lucy?
Joker' the one that wanted her.

1204
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,866
I was just trying to stop
him before you got there.

1205
01:09:14,868 --> 01:09:16,133
I never wanted to touch Lucy.

1206
01:09:16,135 --> 01:09:19,636
I wanted - I wanted to touch
you.

1207
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:20,503
I, I'm sorry. I just.

1208
01:09:20,505 --> 01:09:22,738
Beetle, stop.

1209
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:26,374
You had me at you're
a bunch of sluts.

1210
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:28,542
And they let you stay?

1211
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:33,079
Yep. I ended up watching
porn with them for 3 hours, dude.

1212
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:34,914
It was hot.

1213
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:38,083
That's crazy.

1214
01:09:38,085 --> 01:09:39,884
Hey, man, you
didn't mean what you were

1215
01:09:39,886 --> 01:09:42,152
saying about those Mafiosos,
did you?

1216
01:09:42,154 --> 01:09:44,087
Hell yeah, I did.

1217
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:46,522
Dude, we can try
to talk to the coach.

1218
01:09:46,524 --> 01:09:51,893
I mean, maybe he'll
give you another chance or

1219
01:09:51,895 --> 01:09:53,011
something.

1220
01:09:53,012 --> 01:09:54,128
Camp started today.

1221
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,696
And I'm not there.

1222
01:09:55,698 --> 01:09:57,898
I'm off the team, I got nothing.

1223
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,799
What are you talking about?

1224
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:02,568
I ain't getting outta the hood.

1225
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:06,805
Baseball was my only shot.

1226
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:08,740
You can still
fix this, Sharky...

1227
01:10:08,742 --> 01:10:09,640
what can we do?

1228
01:10:09,642 --> 01:10:11,292
We got to think about something.

1229
01:10:11,293 --> 01:10:12,943
Well, Beetle, what
do you know about my shit?

1230
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:13,877
You get good grades.

1231
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:16,546
You can go to any
college you want.

1232
01:10:16,548 --> 01:10:18,048
You have no

1233
01:10:18,049 --> 01:10:19,549
idea what I have
to go through, man.

1234
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:20,750
You don't even know this but.

1235
01:10:20,752 --> 01:10:22,184
I'm not even a citizen.

1236
01:10:22,186 --> 01:10:23,618
What?

1237
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,653
Bullshit, man.

1238
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,054
You're an illegal?

1239
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,305
Yeah, right.

1240
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:29,555
I've known you
since the first grade.

1241
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,524
Mom brought
me here when I was 2.

1242
01:10:31,526 --> 01:10:34,426
Damn.

1243
01:10:34,428 --> 01:10:36,661
You're a pinche mojado
and nobody ever knew it.

1244
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:39,597
Yeah, I can't let
that stop me, though.

1245
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:44,969
I don't got
time for that right now.

1246
01:10:44,971 --> 01:10:49,038
You better get out of here.

1247
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,706
Are they coming to jump you in?

1248
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,774
Yo, get outta here, Beetle.

1249
01:10:58,714 --> 01:11:00,780
Yo, Beetle, get outta here, man.

1250
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:12,924
So, today's
the day, little Sharky.

1251
01:11:12,926 --> 01:11:14,992
You're gonna be made a Mafioso.

1252
01:11:25,003 --> 01:11:25,901
Let's get ready to do this.

1253
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:26,869
On three.

1254
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:27,836
Hold up, let me tie my shoe.

1255
01:11:27,838 --> 01:11:29,737
No, it's too
late to turn back now.

1256
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:32,906
One. Two.

1257
01:11:32,908 --> 01:11:35,108
Hey! Let go of Sharky.

1258
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:36,609
Hey, get out of here, Beetle.
Ain't nobody

1259
01:11:36,611 --> 01:11:38,877
trying to talk to you. Come on
homies, let's do this.

1260
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:41,713
Oh yeah? Well, I got
somebody that wants to talk to you.

1261
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:42,847
Is that right?

1262
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:46,016
Who's that?

1263
01:12:03,768 --> 01:12:05,501
What the hell is this?

1264
01:12:05,503 --> 01:12:08,103
Hermano, it's time
for us to have a talk man.

1265
01:12:08,105 --> 01:12:10,171
Hey. Where y'all going?

1266
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:12,573
Look at me, just look at me.

1267
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:14,608
My walk, this
ain't no pimp walk.

1268
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,743
I got shot in the ass by
my own homie, man.

1269
01:12:16,745 --> 01:12:18,111
My own homie shot me in the ass,

1270
01:12:18,113 --> 01:12:20,063
friendly fire.

1271
01:12:20,064 --> 01:12:22,014
Do you have an Abuelita?
Yeah, I know you do.

1272
01:12:22,016 --> 01:12:25,083
What if I went to your
grandma's house and jumped

1273
01:12:25,085 --> 01:12:27,518
her ass into my gang?
How would you feel?

1274
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,653
How would you feel?

1275
01:12:29,655 --> 01:12:33,023
You're a natural warrior,
a natural leader of men.

1276
01:12:33,025 --> 01:12:35,225
And the more you realize that,

1277
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:38,294
the less you'e gonna
kick and stab people.

1278
01:12:38,296 --> 01:12:39,595
Why you so low, brother?

1279
01:12:39,597 --> 01:12:41,863
You don't understand.

1280
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:44,866
I like kicking and stabbing.

1281
01:12:44,868 --> 01:12:48,102
Come on, come on. Let
the healing begin, brother,

1282
01:12:48,104 --> 01:12:49,236
let the healing begin.

1283
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:51,838
Let's get out of here, bro.

1284
01:12:51,840 --> 01:13:04,549
Oh, Mina, how I miss you.
You are my everything.

1285
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:13,023
You're just like a flower.

1286
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:16,192
Whassup, fool?

1287
01:13:16,194 --> 01:13:18,561
Cheer up, man. Your
parents will get over it.

1288
01:13:18,563 --> 01:13:20,696
No, man, my whole
family's pissed at me.

1289
01:13:20,698 --> 01:13:22,197
If I don't pay
back the gazebo fund,

1290
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:24,265
they'll never gonna
let me back in the Banda.

1291
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:26,567
Thought you hated
doing that shit anyway.

1292
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:31,805
No, man. I actually love it, ok.
I love the music, the outfits,

1293
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:34,340
the girls. And now
it's all gone.

1294
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:36,642
So we got to get even with Lola.

1295
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:38,844
And get your money back.

1296
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:41,179
Why are you so bent
out of shape about it?

1297
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:43,214
I mean, we all got burned,
but you're taking it extra hard.

1298
01:13:43,216 --> 01:13:44,815
Yeah, for real man, what's up?

1299
01:13:44,817 --> 01:13:46,616
You guys don't get it, do you?

1300
01:13:46,618 --> 01:13:48,150
Get what?

1301
01:13:48,152 --> 01:13:50,719
She didn't just
cheat us out of our money.

1302
01:13:50,721 --> 01:13:52,954
She cheated us
out of our manhood.

1303
01:13:52,956 --> 01:13:54,022
What?

1304
01:13:54,023 --> 01:13:55,089
She cheated me and
Joker out of our manhood.

1305
01:13:55,091 --> 01:14:01,161
You... shut up. You, too? No.

1306
01:14:01,163 --> 01:14:02,862
Yeah, I'm a virgin, too.

1307
01:14:02,864 --> 01:14:04,830
Shut up, no you're not.

1308
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:07,933
No way. That can't be true.
What about those cheerleaders?

1309
01:14:07,935 --> 01:14:08,900
Lies.

1310
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,268
That hoochie from La Puente?

1311
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:11,769
Stories.

1312
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:14,638
Wow. You know, you
told me that one night.

1313
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,808
No, no, no. I never said I did.
I just never denied the stories.

1314
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,242
Wow.

1315
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:21,960
Oh, Sharky.

1316
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:23,677
So all three of us are virgins?

1317
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,947
I guess so.

1318
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:30,750
But the hell if I'm gonna
let Lola get the last laugh.

1319
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:32,718
You still got that
girl, Mina's number?

1320
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,286
Yeah, I actually
memorized her number before

1321
01:14:34,288 --> 01:14:36,821
my dad took the matchbook.
She still wants to see me.

1322
01:14:36,823 --> 01:14:38,889
All right, call her up.

1323
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,474
Ok.

1324
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,058
Tell her to meet
us at my pad in one hour.

1325
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,126
I just got an idea.

1326
01:14:44,128 --> 01:14:46,928
All right. Cool.
All right, you guys.

1327
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:51,064
So we come up the alley.
Mina, you open the back door.

1328
01:14:51,066 --> 01:14:52,999
- Wait.
- Mina, what's this symbol right here?

1329
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:55,401
I drew a little booty
to represent the back door.

1330
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:57,302
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

1331
01:14:57,304 --> 01:14:59,671
Now, these back
stairs are reserved for VIP.

1332
01:14:59,673 --> 01:15:00,872
But they're usually empty.

1333
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:03,307
Now, they're gonna lead
all the way up to the office

1334
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:05,142
that's located above the club.

1335
01:15:05,144 --> 01:15:06,910
And that's Lola's room.

1336
01:15:06,912 --> 01:15:08,845
You mean this room
with the devil lady in it?

1337
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:11,280
That's funny, Mina.

1338
01:15:11,282 --> 01:15:13,181
So the
stairs do go up to the roof?

1339
01:15:13,183 --> 01:15:15,850
Yeah. And you see
where this lipstick is?

1340
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:18,652
That's where the cabinet
is with the little metal box.

1341
01:15:18,654 --> 01:15:22,155
That's where Lola stores all her
money that she steals.

1342
01:15:22,157 --> 01:15:24,157
Don't worry, Mina.
We'll get your money back.

1343
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:25,992
And when my family's
gazebo is finished,

1344
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:28,060
you can come over and
I'll sing to you.

1345
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:29,795
Guys, wait a minute.
What about all those bouncers?

1346
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:32,697
Is there like a plan B in case
we can't get out that way?

1347
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:37,134
Of course there is.
Trust me, Beetle. We can't lose.

1348
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:38,702
Famous last words, Bro.

1349
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:44,207
Yeah. Let's roll, Puto.

1350
01:15:55,153 --> 01:15:57,820
Mina, it's me, Joker.

1351
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:11,265
Ok, the roof is that way.
Good luck, guys. Be careful.

1352
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:14,368
Shhh.

1353
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,441
There's a lot of things I
do, I think about baseball a lot.

1354
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:27,279
I am going to Swing away,
swinging until my time is up.

1355
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:28,480
Oh, shit, that's the Coach.

1356
01:16:28,482 --> 01:16:30,148
So what? Let's go.

1357
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,017
Because the batter's up.
The batter is up.

1358
01:16:33,019 --> 01:16:35,319
You can make this happen.
This is totally, I'm down and

1359
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:36,920
ready for you.

1360
01:16:44,128 --> 01:16:47,496
All right. Here it is.

1361
01:16:52,302 --> 01:16:55,936
Here, Joker, hold this. All
right, Beetle, get down there.

1362
01:16:55,938 --> 01:16:58,338
What? Why do I have to go down?

1363
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,439
Well, you're the skinniest.

1364
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:01,941
Go ahead, Beetle.

1365
01:17:11,751 --> 01:17:13,217
I can't hold on, Sharky.

1366
01:17:13,219 --> 01:17:14,885
Go, come on. You can do it.

1367
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,886
I can't.

1368
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:03,832
Sharky, catch.

1369
01:18:03,834 --> 01:18:08,469
Throw it higher.

1370
01:18:08,471 --> 01:18:10,237
You throw like a girl.

1371
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:14,007
Come on, guys, this isn't funny.

1372
01:18:14,009 --> 01:18:17,377
Oh, shit. Someone's coming.

1373
01:18:46,307 --> 01:18:52,344
Robbery. Robbery. Robbery.

1374
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:58,983
Let's get the hell out of here.

1375
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:10,831
Oh, base hit!
Oh, yeah, round second.

1376
01:20:10,857 --> 01:20:12,388
Oh. Go to third.

1377
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:19,261
I'm around third, oh. Slide.
I gotta slide. Go home.

1378
01:20:19,263 --> 01:20:22,097
Slide! Slide! What the hell?

1379
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:23,465
What's up, Coach?

1380
01:20:23,467 --> 01:20:24,966
I'm a little busy here, fellas.

1381
01:20:24,968 --> 01:20:26,267
Yeah, looks like
she's doing all the work.

1382
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:28,168
Yup. You're a lazy lover, Coach.

1383
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:30,336
What's the principal
gonna think about this, Coach?

1384
01:20:30,338 --> 01:20:32,971
- Hey fellas, can't we just uh.
- Let's make a d -

1385
01:20:32,973 --> 01:20:35,606
Let's cut the crap. Is
Sharky back on the team or what?

1386
01:20:35,608 --> 01:20:37,107
Shark - oh, Rodriguez?

1387
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:39,359
Yeah.

1388
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,610
Yeah. Of course. No
hard feelings, right, buddy?

1389
01:20:41,613 --> 01:20:43,579
Yeah. See you at practice.

1390
01:20:43,581 --> 01:20:48,616
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Now
get the hell outta the room.

1391
01:20:48,618 --> 01:20:51,418
Make me proud, Coach.

1392
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,386
Now, where were we?

1393
01:20:53,388 --> 01:20:54,720
Sorry, your time's up.

1394
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:57,756
No extra innings?
Oh, oh, foul, foul ball.

1395
01:21:05,264 --> 01:21:07,163
We can't lose, huh?

1396
01:21:07,165 --> 01:21:09,298
Relax, I got an
emergency back-up plan.

1397
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,434
Emergency what?
Not the Mafiosos man!

1398
01:21:12,436 --> 01:21:16,304
Now, let's be real cool, man.
Real cool. Oh.

1399
01:21:20,143 --> 01:21:24,011
Wait. Before you handle
these idiots, I want to know.

1400
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:27,748
You actually thought that you
could steal from Lola?

1401
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,382
Oh, we're gonna
shut you down, Lola.

1402
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,384
Tell your goons to back off.

1403
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:37,322
Did you hear that?
Kid says he's gonna shut me down.

1404
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:41,025
The only thing that you're gonna
do is tell me how you got in.

1405
01:21:41,027 --> 01:21:42,192
Who helped you?

1406
01:21:42,194 --> 01:21:45,695
Screw you.

1407
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,129
Who helped you?

1408
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:48,563
We did it ourselves, Bitch.

1409
01:21:48,565 --> 01:21:52,733
Ok, hero boy. You tell me.
Who got you in here?

1410
01:21:52,735 --> 01:21:54,000
<i>LOUD RUMBLING.</i>

1411
01:21:54,002 --> 01:21:56,102
What was that?

1412
01:21:56,103 --> 01:21:58,203
Turns out, we're not
the only ones you screwed over.

1413
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:27,332
Women of Lola's
run, you are free!

1414
01:22:32,305 --> 01:22:36,307
Girls, we're free! Let's go!

1415
01:22:47,218 --> 01:22:50,352
Damn, fool, you
don't even care that she used to

1416
01:22:50,354 --> 01:22:51,720
work at Lola's, huh?

1417
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:54,289
No, I don't. It's just
like that movie, Pretty Woman.

1418
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:57,458
That's crazy. What you gonna
do, you gonna pimp her out now?

1419
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:00,194
Not even. I got her a job
that's gonna help her forget her past.

1420
01:23:00,196 --> 01:23:01,796
Where at?

1421
01:23:01,797 --> 01:23:03,397
She's a cone jockey
down at the Icee Freeze.

1422
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:06,299
Oh, shit, it's the cop dude. I
can't get in trouble again. Oh.

1423
01:23:06,301 --> 01:23:08,534
Well, well, well.

1424
01:23:08,536 --> 01:23:10,836
If it isn't Peter Rabbit
and his bunny boys.

1425
01:23:10,838 --> 01:23:12,804
Looks like it's my lucky day.

1426
01:23:12,806 --> 01:23:14,539
Are you gonna
kill us or arrest us?

1427
01:23:14,541 --> 01:23:18,476
Kill ya? I want to thank you.
You guys opened my eyes.

1428
01:23:18,478 --> 01:23:21,712
I'm getting a divorce
and couldn't be happier.

1429
01:23:21,714 --> 01:23:24,815
As you guys know,
my wife is a slut.

1430
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:26,082
I knew that.

1431
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,551
Actually, I owe a
debt of gratitude to my

1432
01:23:28,553 --> 01:23:29,818
friend Benjamin here.

1433
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,119
For what?

1434
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:32,553
Because of this young man,

1435
01:23:32,555 --> 01:23:35,188
I was able to put a sting on
the most notorious brothel

1436
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,123
that ever poisoned the
streets of our city.

1437
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,691
Yeah, Beetle?

1438
01:23:38,692 --> 01:23:40,258
You really shut things
up at headquarters for me, kid.

1439
01:23:40,261 --> 01:23:41,994
Thanks.

1440
01:23:41,995 --> 01:23:43,728
Yeah, no problem, Officer.
That means we're cool, right?

1441
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:47,265
Actually, I did a little
research on you, Benjamin.

1442
01:23:47,267 --> 01:23:48,866
And I found out you weren't
born in this country.

1443
01:23:48,868 --> 01:23:50,334
That you're actually
here illegaly.

1444
01:23:50,336 --> 01:23:52,302
So I need you to turn around
and put your hands on your-

1445
01:23:52,304 --> 01:23:53,303
Hey, you can't do that!

1446
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:55,438
That's not cool.

1447
01:23:55,440 --> 01:24:01,877
You guys are rich.
Can't you take a joke? Come on.

1448
01:24:01,879 --> 01:24:06,280
I'm not gonna arrest ya.
However, whatever happened

1449
01:24:06,282 --> 01:24:08,682
to that bunny suit? I need it
back. You guys have that?

1450
01:24:08,684 --> 01:24:12,118
Actually, Officer, the
bunny suit was lost in action.

1451
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,252
Oh.

1452
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:14,286
Yeah.

1453
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:15,287
Yeah, we're
really sorry about that.

1454
01:24:15,289 --> 01:24:17,455
But I can invite you
to some party punch.

1455
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:18,823
My Tia's secret recipe.

1456
01:24:18,825 --> 01:24:20,758
Nah, I think I'm gonna
have to pass on that, guys.

1457
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,626
Her secret's Tequila.

1458
01:24:22,628 --> 01:24:25,362
You talked me into it.

1459
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:26,730
Viola.

1460
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:29,532
All right. Thanks.
You guys be good.

1461
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:31,500
All right.

1462
01:24:31,502 --> 01:24:32,834
What the hell?

1463
01:24:32,836 --> 01:24:35,703
Diana. Octavio.

1464
01:24:40,376 --> 01:24:42,909
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Damas e Caballeros,

1465
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:50,882
welcome to our first
annual Gazebo Banda Party.

1466
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:58,256
Ok. Now we are
ready to Rock la casa.

1467
01:26:22,441 --> 01:26:25,542
Hey. You made it.

1468
01:26:25,544 --> 01:26:27,010
Yeah.

1469
01:26:27,012 --> 01:26:28,544
How are you?

1470
01:26:28,546 --> 01:26:30,712
What's the cop doing here?
I thought he was after you?

1471
01:26:30,714 --> 01:26:33,281
Felicia, there's something
I have to explain to you.

1472
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:35,716
I used to think that losing
my virginity would make me a

1473
01:26:35,718 --> 01:26:37,517
man, but I know it's stupid.

1474
01:26:37,519 --> 01:26:40,887
And trying to get laid,
acting like a big shot

1475
01:26:40,889 --> 01:26:42,955
doesn't make you
man, it makes you a jerk.

1476
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:45,691
So, what are you saying?

1477
01:26:45,693 --> 01:26:48,560
I'm saying that I, I don't
know if I'm ready to be a man.

1478
01:26:48,562 --> 01:26:51,996
But I really want to
be your boyfriend.

1479
01:26:51,998 --> 01:27:00,737
Wow. That actually sounded
pretty mature, Beetle.

1480
01:27:00,739 --> 01:27:02,772
But a deal is not a deal unless
it's sealed with a kiss.

1481
01:27:02,796 --> 01:27:18,796
