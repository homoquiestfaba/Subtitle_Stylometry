1
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,211
There was a time...

2
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,379
...not long ago...

3
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,183
where the great West...

4
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,258
...prior to century's turn...

5
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,258
...abounded in legend.

6
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,852
Oh, there were stories of fabled gunmen.

7
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:41,559
whose bullets always magically
reached their mark...

8
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,330
...and mighty stallions
whose tireless gallop.

9
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,530
...rivaled the speed of the wind...

10
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,472
...and glorious women whose beauty.

11
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,477
...stunned both mind and heart.

12
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,910
And in some cases,
a man became immortal.

13
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,453
Oh, it's not that lies
were told about him.

14
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,490
...or impossible feats ascribed to him...

15
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,254
...but every detail about him.

16
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,819
was seized upon and passed on.

17
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,957
with the most scrupulous
and loving care.

18
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,367
And in due time,
he will become a legend.

19
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,337
Oh, it has happened.

20
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,239
...to a few of the famous characters
of the mountain desert.

21
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:29,213
They become legends
before their deaths.

22
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,045
But nowhere in the vast spread
of the mountain desert.

23
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,052
was there a greater legend told.

24
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,088
...than the bloody tale of revenge.

25
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,816
...between Red Pierre.

26
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,552
...and the phantom gunfighter,
Bob McGurk.

27
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,891
Oddly enough,
the legend of Red Pierre.

28
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,124
...did not begin with his ride.

29
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,258
...from the school of Father Victor
to Morgantown.

30
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,667
Distant, many days of difficult.

31
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,466
...and dangerous travel.

32
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,440
Neither did legend
seize upon his showdown.

33
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,374
with Hurley and Diaz.

34
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,969
Though these things were
unquestionably known to many...

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,243
...they did not strike
the popular imagination.

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,375
No. What first set men on fire.

37
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,354
was the way Red Pierre
buried his father...

38
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,515
...at the point of a gun...

39
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,525
Morgantown.

40
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,192
If old age don't get you...

41
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,202
whiskey will.

42
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,959
You got some business with me, stranger?

43
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:26,889
I do.

44
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,974
There ain't gonna be any trouble.

45
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,774
...as long as you keep your hands.

46
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,441
...out of another man's business.

47
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,477
Game stops now.

48
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,705
Stand back from the table.

49
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,546
God damn you!

50
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,150
I ain't saying anything to anybody.

51
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,154
...about what happened here.

52
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,121
You was in the right.

53
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,717
I've seen everything.

54
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,557
- You got a horse?
- Huh?

55
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,563
Out front.
You got a horse?

56
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,064
Oh, yes, sir.

57
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,466
But, actually, it's a burro.

58
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,808
Then you don't mind me borrowing it?

59
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,138
No. No. No, sir.

60
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,145
What's mine is yours.

61
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,943
'Cause my horse died.
Otherwise I wouldn't ask.

62
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,277
Thanks.

63
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,855
Are you one of Jim Boone's men?

64
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,950
No.

65
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,669
- Stand up.
- What are you doing?

66
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,902
Tie me back up on the tree.

67
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,037
If they find me released,
they will slay me...

68
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,049
...tear up my insides, amigo...

69
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,177
...and kill my family.

70
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,187
Take this.

71
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,519
- Take it and go.
- Thought maybe I was dead.

72
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,719
Maybe I think I'm in heaven now.

73
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:19,127
May God grant you many riches.

74
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,099
They call it "gringo's desire. "

75
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,792
Got a $40 saddle on a $10 horse.

76
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,184
Horse...

77
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,221
On a saddle...

78
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,460
Sit down before you get all worked up.

79
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,599
All right. Tell me...

80
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,103
...as briefly as you can...

81
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,866
...how I got here
and who picked me up.

82
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,535
My father and his gang
passed you lying there.

83
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,635
They brought you home.

84
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,475
Who's your father?

85
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,515
Jim Boone.

86
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,414
And his gang?

87
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,008
Cut-Throats.

88
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,452
Keep your hands steady.

89
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,183
I got a nervous trigger finger.

90
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,619
Yep. Dad is pretty well-known.

91
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,730
What am I doing here?

92
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,830
You're here to take Hal's place.

93
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,501
My brother Hal.

94
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,044
He's dead.
He died last night.

95
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,374
Dad found you on the way home.

96
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,317
Brought you to take his place.

97
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,479
Makes me think, personally...

98
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,422
I agree with Black Gandil.

99
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,959
This is the worst fool thing.

100
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,621
Dad has ever done.

101
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,130
What do we want with you.

102
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,201
...in Hal's place?

103
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,164
I have to leave right away.

104
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,513
Tell me about Hal.

105
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,378
I don't know you well enough
to talk of him.

106
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,280
Sorry.

107
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,253
Well...

108
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,415
I guess that was
a mean thing to say.

109
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,096
I'll tell you about Hal...

110
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,930
...if I can.

111
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,163
You gotta tell me anything you can.

112
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,672
I gotta be like him, haven't I?

113
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,008
You could try till
the rattlers got tame...

114
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,548
...but it would take ten of you
to make one like Hal.

115
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,016
He was Dad's only son.

116
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,984
He was my brother.

117
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,472
Seems as if I was sort of stepping in.

118
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,166
...on a little family party.

119
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,908
Run along, Jack.

120
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,106
You ain't so growed up
as I was thinking.

121
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,047
Now, hold on.
Maybe you're more grown up.

122
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,982
Which is it?

123
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,213
You turning into a woman, Jack?

124
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,736
You're not as big as I expected.

125
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,803
You're older than I thought...

126
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,102
...but not too old
to be made what I want.

127
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,507
I suppose it's a pretty small chance
of my getting away.

128
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,644
Just about none, son.

129
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,779
The girl kept you pretty busy
trying to make a break...

130
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,790
...and if she couldn't do anything...

131
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,190
...maybe you'd have a pile of trouble.

132
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,127
with one of them guarding you.

133
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,027
Come here.

134
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,915
You must got reason.
I can see that.

135
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,681
Now, here's the point.
I know young men...

136
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,689
...because I can remember pretty close.

137
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,850
what I was at your age.

138
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,186
I wasn't any lady's lapdog, at that...

139
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,664
...but time and older men molded me.

140
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,894
...the same way I'm gonna mold you.

141
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,903
Understand?

142
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:41,609
What if I stop fighting
and call myself a member?

143
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,642
Then I'd know it was because.

144
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,481
...you were wanting something.

145
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,418
What is it you're after?

146
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,950
Two things.

147
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,086
Lad, I like this way of talk.

148
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,026
One, two!

149
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,428
You're quick like a two-gun man.

150
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,063
Now, wait.

151
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,004
Can I help you out myself...

152
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,303
...or do you need the gang?

153
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,611
I need the gang.

154
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,684
Then come along.

155
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,279
I'll leave it up to them.

156
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,830
Listen up.

157
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,695
This is...

158
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
What the hell's your name, son?

159
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,429
- Pierre.
- Pierre.

160
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,437
- Red Pierre.
- He'll be one of us.

161
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,440
...if he can get the gang
to do two things.

162
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,170
I ask, will you hear him, for me?

163
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,736
And then pass on
whether or not to try his game.

164
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,212
Here's the first.

165
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,220
I want to bury a man in Morgantown...

166
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,085
...and I need help to do it.

167
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,020
You heard me, boys.
Blood to start with.

168
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,028
I like that.

169
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,223
Who's the man
you want us to put out?

170
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,697
It's my father.

171
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,290
What the Christ?

172
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,233
He's already dead.

173
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,772
He's laying in his house
a few miles out of Morgantown.

174
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,738
As he died, he asked me.

175
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,907
...if he could be buried in a spot.

176
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,985
...he called his home
for a good many years.

177
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,387
He said that the grass
grew quicker there.

178
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,821
...than any other place
after the snow went.

179
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,586
That's a damn good reason.

180
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,525
It's a damn good reason indeed!

181
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,790
Who's your father?

182
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,695
It's Martin Ryder.

183
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,325
A ringer.

184
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,336
Remember what I said, Jim.

185
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,565
The shipwreck fella.

186
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,437
Pierre...

187
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,172
...talk soft and talk fast.

188
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,305
We all know Martin Ryder.

189
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,714
...had only two sons.

190
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,718
You're not either of them.

191
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,219
Not by the mother of those two.

192
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,882
- She must've been a whore.
- Shut up, Gandil.

193
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,291
Jim.

194
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,906
Why do you need us?

195
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,647
Because I'm likely wanted
in Morgantown.

196
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,349
I got in a little mix-up with Mac Hurley.

197
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,722
...and Carlos Diaz.

198
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,591
I knew Diaz.

199
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,130
Diaz was a badass.

200
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,898
Well, speaking personal...

201
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm ready to go with you.

202
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,106
...down to Morgantown.

203
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,975
...and bury your father.

204
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,140
- Shipshape.
- Sí.

205
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,582
And with all the trimmings.

206
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,779
Morgantown will join in...

207
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,719
...voluntarily, of course...

208
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,791
...under cover of all our six-guns.

209
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,621
Hold on.

210
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,695
What's the second request?

211
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,923
Later.

212
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,999
It's a bigger job than this one?

213
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,397
Yeah.

214
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,303
In the meantime...

215
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,780
I'm your man.

216
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,913
Okay. It's a deal.

217
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,615
Hold on.

218
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,763
Loco weed.

219
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,372
Ándale.

220
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,039
No.

221
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,046
To the empty chair.

222
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,050
To the empty chair.

223
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,743
My son Pierre, here I lie.

224
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,379
with three chunks of lead
from the gun of Bob McGurk...

225
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,390
...and there ain't no way of doubting.

226
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,619
...that I'm about to go out.

227
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,465
I ain't complaining none.

228
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,538
I've eaten my meat to order,
well-done and rare.

229
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,472
Mostly rare.
That don't help me none...

230
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,805
...lying here with a through ticket
to someplace.

231
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,209
...that's farther south of Texas...

232
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,050
...and a whole lot hotter, too.

233
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,145
I just lie here.

234
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,813
...and watch the world getting dimmer.

235
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,824
...until I begin to be seeing things.

236
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,053
...out of my past.

237
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,790
That shows the devil
ain't losing no time with me.

238
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,896
But the thing that comes back oftenest.

239
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,972
...and hits me the hardest
is the sight of your mother.

240
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,303
...lying with you in the hollow of her arm.

241
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,434
...and whispering something in your ear.

242
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,808
...just before she went out.

243
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,583
Now, what exactly she whispered.

244
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,245
...is the subject of this here letter.

245
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,846
So I got an idea.

246
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,187
...that I had to write to you, Pierre...

247
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,886
...and try to set the truth square.

248
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,266
There ain't nothing
that can be made up to you...

249
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,929
...but knowing the truth may help some.

250
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,938
Poor kid.

251
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,065
Ain't got no father
in the eyes of the law.

252
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,406
Neither did you have no mother.

253
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,412
And therefore, ain't no name.

254
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:38,108
...that belongs to you by rights.

255
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,148
You see, your mother and me...

256
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,589
Irene...

257
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,387
we was young, just kids...

258
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,462
...but we was in love.

259
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,864
But the truth is...

260
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,128
I was married before I met Irene.

261
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,568
So there ain't no alibi for me.

262
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,436
But me being so close to hell now...

263
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,442
I look back to that time...

264
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,274
...and somehow I see
no wrong in it still.

265
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,371
And if I done wrong then...

266
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,882
I got my share of hellfire for it.

267
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,253
- Who votes for death?
- No!

268
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,328
- Amen, brother.
- Let's string them up.

269
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,056
- You ready to die?
- No.

270
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,496
Huh? You ready to die?

271
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,397
He's shaking already.

272
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,766
Oh, he's showing yellow now!

273
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,032
Oh, you was right, McGurk.

274
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,752
Let me ask you something...

275
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,760
You pig!

276
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,876
It's praying time, missy.

277
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,556
I warn you, McGurk...

278
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,717
...if you kill him,
you're gonna suffer for it.

279
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:31,261
I will never ever leave you alone.

280
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,331
...until you suffer for it.

281
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,964
Sweetheart, there's an end to this story.

282
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,903
...that I think you just don't see.

283
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,095
And you think I'd marry you, huh?

284
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,670
I'm gonna kill you for this.

285
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,800
You and the rest of them.

286
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,934
One by one.

287
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,652
I don't wanna punish you
for what you did to me.

288
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,624
I just wanna make sure
you don't do it again.

289
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,207
Over the next few months...

290
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,470
...the whole crew
had their way with Irene...

291
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,671
...and did most of what
they wanted with her.

292
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,873
...and to her.

293
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,882
She played the good little bottom dog.

294
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,214
...as long as she could.

295
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,255
It was H.A., the sheriff
of that lawless town...

296
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,347
who kept Irene locked up in his jail.

297
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,483
...a few nights a week.

298
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,563
Then, one night,
after many months of torture...

299
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,859
Irene began her oath of vengeance.

300
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,366
You dog!

301
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,042
And she was intent on doing
the same to the other two.

302
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,177
when she unexpectedly suffered.

303
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,484
...a fatal ending from cholera.

304
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,558
The other problem...

305
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,253
You just sort of happened along.

306
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,232
But I'll never forget that day, son...

307
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,166
...the way you looked...

308
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,102
...like you was lying in a red river...

309
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,834
when she whispered something
only you'll know

310
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,500
...in your ear.

311
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,856
Before she went,
she got ahold of my hand.

312
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,519
...and looked at me
with them blue eyes and said...

313
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,292
Bob McGurk.

314
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,735
No. No.

315
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,975
No, no, no, no.

316
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,443
No. Come on, Irene...

317
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:26,921
I buried Irene.

318
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,692
...under a pile of rocks.

319
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,200
Then I took you, Pierre,
and I knew I wasn't.

320
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:34,100
...no sort of man
to raise the son of Irene...

321
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,105
...so I brought you to Father Victor.

322
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,300
...and left you in his arms.

323
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,588
When I first saw him...

324
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:40,768
When I first saw him...

325
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:44,144
...he was a child, a baby,
- "PRONOUNCED ZIN-ZUN-ZAN"

326
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,479
...but he came to me and took one finger.

327
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,075
...of my hand in his small fist.

328
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,246
...and looked up at me.

329
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,620
The smile of an infant goes to the heart.

330
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,716
...swifter than the thrust of a knife.

331
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,387
I looked down upon him.

332
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,259
...and thought many things...

333
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,265
...and I knew that I was chosen.

334
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,063
...to teach the child.

335
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,870
Another man would have
given Pierre a Bible.

336
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,944
...and a Latin grammar and missal.

337
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,740
I gave him the wild country.

338
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,475
...to say his prayers and patter his Latin.

339
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,279
I taught his mind
but did not forget his body.

340
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,355
If he is to go out among wild men...

341
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,582
...he must have strength of the spirit.

342
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,625
He must also have strength of the body.

343
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,388
...that they will understand and respect.

344
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,485
To make the body strong
requires thought and care.

345
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,189
Mere riding and running
and swinging of the ax

346
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,857
will not develop every muscle.

347
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,457
So I made a ring...

348
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:15,164
...and there Pierre works every day.

349
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,902
His boxing and wrestling teachers
have abandoned him.

350
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,444
The last man left with a broken jaw

351
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,174
...and a limp on one leg.

352
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,826
So, for partners...

353
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,488
I give him men.

354
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,829
who have committed small sins.

355
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,980
You got warned.

356
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,524
Don't ever say you didn't.

357
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,847
In all the history of our order...

358
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,356
...there is hardly a man
who will go out armed.

359
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,119
...like Pierre.

360
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,217
He's young, he's fearless...

361
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,025
...he's pure of heart and single of mind.

362
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,031
I speak from the best intentions...

363
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,260
...good Father.

364
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,896
This boy, whose mind is so clear...

365
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:58,339
...arm him with a single wrong thought...

366
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,570
with a single doubt.

367
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:04,136
...of the eternal goodness of God's plans...

368
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,446
...and he will become a thunderbolt,
indeed, dear Father...

369
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,386
...but not one
which even your strong hand.

370
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,389
...could control.

371
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,092
I've heard you, Brother...

372
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,255
...but we will see.

373
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,503
Father.

374
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,078
I have a letter for you, my son.

375
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,895
Well, son, here I lie...

376
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,295
with my wife's sons, Bill and Burt...

377
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,630
waiting for me to go out,
and when I do...

378
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,635
...they'll grab the coin I've saved up.

379
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,138
...and leave me to lie here
and rot maybe.

380
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,640
When I go...

381
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,973
I'll save them a seat in hell.

382
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,047
So I'm writing to you, Pierre...

383
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,810
...part to tell you what you ought to know...

384
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,215
...part because I got sort of a crazy idea.

385
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,219
...that maybe you could get down here.

386
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,653
...before I go out.

387
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,481
Vengeance is mine.

388
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,293
No.

389
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,634
Pierre...

390
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,071
Brave boy, look at me.

391
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:12,665
I...

392
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,644
I ain't no imitation man.

393
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,338
Even now.

394
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,383
But I ain't a ghost of what I was.

395
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,544
I lived...

396
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,988
Nearly sneezed there.

397
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,637
Ground's kind of moist maybe.

398
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,740
Like I was saying...

399
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,587
I spent the past 20 years
living a coward, Pierre.

400
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,791
But after all this time...

401
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,094
I set out for that McGurk.

402
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,632
Pierre...

403
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,293
I'm about to go out...

404
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,633
...but two more vengeances remain...

405
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:59,176
...and I can no longer deliver
them with my own hands.

406
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,837
First, find Mac Hurley.

407
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,813
He's now nothing more
than a saloon crook.

408
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,314
He'll probably be at Muldoon's...

409
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:10,615
...stealing the pockets
out of some poor fool's pants.

410
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,281
He's in poor health.

411
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,222
Be careful.
He's hired a bodyguard.

412
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,157
...to safeguard him.

413
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,889
Some say he's faster
on the draw than Bob McGurk...

414
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,692
...but that's just hearsay.

415
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,766
He don't say much...

416
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,698
...but when he does,
he talks with bullets.

417
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,677
How many men you got left?

418
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,611
You don't understand?

419
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,985
You don't want to talk to me, huh?

420
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,487
I have nothing saving one
great and terrible treasure.

421
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,189
which was predestined to you.

422
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:58,960
It has brought good
to all who possess it.

423
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,403
But for every good thing
it works for you...

424
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,339
...it will work evil on some other.

425
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,604
Great is its blessing...

426
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,044
...and great is its burden.

427
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,206
Do you accept it, Pierre?

428
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,783
Dear Father, with all my heart.

429
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,027
God, pardon the sins
you shall commit.

430
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,150
Stand back from the table.

431
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,493
Pierre, you don't owe me nothing.

432
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,788
...but harsh words.

433
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,524
But when I die,
touch my eyelids soft.

434
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,623
...and draw them shut.

435
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,668
I've seen the look
of dead man's eyes.

436
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,135
Close them.

437
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:45,436
And I know I'll go to sleep
and have good dreams.

438
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:55,012
Irene, I've come for you...

439
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,952
...because the time has come, Irene.

440
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,580
We have to ride out together.

441
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,886
We have a long ways to go.

442
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,735
- Mr. Patterson.
- Eat up, boys.

443
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,834
Don't be wasting
any of this good food.

444
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,142
- Pork chops.
- Give me that piece of bread there.

445
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,508
Rice. That's Chinese food.

446
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,850
I had Chinese food.
It's pretty good.

447
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:36,518
Well, we kept our part
of your bargain, Pierre.

448
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,892
We've seen your father
buried in the corner plot.

449
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,092
What's the second part?

450
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,997
Rob the bank?

451
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,704
Hold up a train full of gold?

452
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,434
I love trains.

453
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,907
Round up all the sheriffs.

454
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,001
...from here to the edge of the mountain?

455
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,103
Serves them right.

456
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,114
I know that one.

457
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,116
Roll all those together...

458
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,413
...and you'll begin to get
an idea of what I'll ask.

459
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:10,752
- Pierre...
- Well, look at Jack.

460
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,829
...I wanna thank you.

461
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,490
...for the gun.

462
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,528
Sit down, girl.

463
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,764
Sit down and be one of us.

464
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,115
One of us you are...

465
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,313
...by your own choice,
from this day on.

466
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,355
You're neither man nor woman,
but a shooter.

467
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,050
with every man's hand against you.

468
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,961
You're done with any hope of a home.

469
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,964
...or friends.

470
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:52,302
You're one of us.

471
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,197
Poor Jack.

472
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,306
My girl.

473
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,642
Poor Jack.

474
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,011
Shake, call it square?

475
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,918
- To Jack.
- Yeah. Here's to Jack.

476
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:15,048
To Jack.

477
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,024
You know, speaking of guns...

478
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,061
...there's only one thing
I can handle better...

479
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,597
...and that's a sledgehammer.

480
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,964
No, no, listen.
Now, a gun's all right in its way.

481
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,969
But for working a crowd...

482
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,902
well, you give me a hammer...

483
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,837
...and I'll show you a way out.

484
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,808
You give me a pair of sixes, Garry...

485
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,505
...and you can have
all the hammers you want.

486
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,947
Ain't nothing makes a crowd
remember its hell.

487
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,018
...like a pair of barking sixes.

488
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,679
- Well, that may be.
- Yeah.

489
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,279
That may be.
But once they've heard.

490
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,485
...the sound of bone crunching.

491
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,118
...under the hammer...

492
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,594
...there's nothing to hold them.

493
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,461
- Oh, I wanna see that.
- Well, maybe you will, Phil.

494
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,502
- Listen, I've heard this story before.
- Maybe you will.

495
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,230
You know, it was the hammer.

496
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,397
...that started me for the long trail west.

497
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:12,141
I'm lonely.

498
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,395
I'm not.

499
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,472
Yeah. Yeah!

500
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,592
And they scattered.

501
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,628
And I kept right on.

502
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,629
And I didn't ever really stop.

503
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,325
...till I reached the mountain desert.

504
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,163
...and you, Jim.

505
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,032
Well...

506
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,596
...that's a pretty good yarn...

507
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,767
...but I can tell you one to cap it.

508
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,368
Oh, right.

509
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,897
McGurk.

510
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,733
Sorry to drop in on you like this, Jim...

511
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,901
...but I'm afraid I've got
some unpleasant news.

512
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,641
Martin Ryder is dead.

513
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,877
I suppose you know

514
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,887
...he left behind two mongrel bastards.

515
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,924
I really don't give a damn about them.

516
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,026
I'm more interested.

517
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,793
...in another bastard that's cropped up.

518
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,835
As a matter of fact...

519
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,201
...he's sitting right over there.

520
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,275
...at your little family party.

521
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,405
I've never stepped my nose
in your business.

522
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,345
...in the past, Jim.

523
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,179
And I've never crossed you, have I?

524
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,419
Never.

525
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,924
Well, I'm afraid tonight,
Jim, I have to break custom.

526
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,364
That bastard has to go...

527
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,635
...and I want you
to see to it that he does.

528
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,771
McGurk, I'd... I'd sooner
cross the devil than cross you.

529
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:02,209
There's no shame in admitting that.

530
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,339
But I... I've lost my boy Hal.

531
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,077
Yeah.

532
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,747
Yeah, I know.
That was tough.

533
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,249
I knew him, you know.

534
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,954
From a distance, of course.

535
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,620
Pierre here.

536
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,393
...is filling Hal's place in the family.

537
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,025
You didn't answer me, Jim.

538
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,304
You gonna do this for me or not?

539
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:35,072
McGurk, you gonna
pin me down on this?

540
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,789
Why don't you take tonight
to think about it?

541
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,726
I'll be at Gaffney's place in town.

542
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,557
But I want an answer in the morning.

543
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,063
Gentlemen...

544
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:06,505
...let's have a toast.

545
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:12,846
To a long life
and much happiness.

546
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,110
Drink up.

547
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,181
I said, drink up.

548
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,391
Where's McGurk?

549
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,236
Where is he?

550
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,446
Haven't seen him.

551
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,825
McGurk!

552
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,810
Blood on the floor.

553
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,815
If McGurk is hurt, by God,
his charm is broken.

554
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,385
Patterson, Gandil,
go out back and look for him.

555
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,511
Rodrigo, take the door.

556
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,950
Gotta finish the job.

557
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:06,027
Son, it's a great work
you've done for all of us.

558
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,687
...if you've drawn the blood
from McGurk.

559
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,280
Those who are curious
about the period which followed...

560
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,187
...during which Pierre became known
only as "Red Pierre,"

561
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,815
...throughout the mountain desert,
you can hear tales of his doings.

562
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:39,053
...from the analysts of all ranges.

563
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,993
Now, this story.

564
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,792
...has only to do.

565
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,799
with his struggle with McGurk.

566
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,836
...and must end
where the struggle ended.

567
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,428
Now, the gap of two years,
which occurs here...

568
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,134
...is due to the fact
that during that period...

569
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,643
McGurk vanished
from the mountain desert.

570
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,679
He died away
from the eyes of men...

571
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:01,012
...and in their minds,
he became that legend.

572
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,551
...that lives still so vividly...

573
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,554
...the legend of the pale face...

574
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,022
...the sneering, bloodless lips...

575
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:12,856
...and the hand that never failed.

576
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,330
During this lapse time,
there were many who claimed.

577
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,425
...he had ridden off
into some lonesome haunt.

578
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,561
...and died of the wounds he received.

579
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,434
...from Pierre's bullet.

580
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,371
A great majority, however...

581
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,500
would never accept that story.

582
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,170
And even after
two years had rolled by...

583
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,510
...they still shook their heads.

584
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,606
...and awaited his return.

585
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,978
In the meantime,
the terror of his name.

586
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,680
...passed on to him.

587
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,985
who had broken
the charm of McGurk.

588
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,659
Well...

589
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,593
...not all that grim significance.

590
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,722
...passed on to Red Pierre indeed...

591
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,427
...because he never impressed
the public imagination.

592
00:57:52,535 --> 00:57:55,800
...as did the terrible
ruthlessness of McGurk.

593
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,395
At that...

594
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,840
...he did do enough
to keep tongues wagging.

595
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,878
Old cattlemen love to tell.

596
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,709
...those familiar exploits
of the two sheriffs.

597
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,375
There was that thousand-mile pursuit
of Camby...

598
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:12,251
with its half-tragic
and half-humorous conclusion.

599
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,482
Or the sacking of Two Rivers.

600
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,650
Then there was that three-corner battle.

601
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,057
...against Rodriguez and Blaun.

602
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,187
But men could not forget.

603
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,424
...that in all his work...

604
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,501
...there rode behind Red Pierre.

605
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,901
...six dauntless warriors
of the mountain desert...

606
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,870
while McGurk...

607
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:34,000
McGurk had been always
a single hand against the world...

608
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,079
...a veritable lone wolf.

609
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,078
Uh, it's too late for business.

610
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:14,911
I'm a-closing up.

611
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:17,350
We're going to a bit of a dance.

612
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:20,081
We'll take those evening clothes.

613
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,851
Uh, they ain't for sale.
They's just samples.

614
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,256
But right over here...

615
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,692
This ain't a question of selling.

616
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:29,196
We're here to accept a little donation.

617
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,792
But right over here,
I've got a line of goods.

618
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,870
...you might be interested in.

619
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,935
You're Red Pierre.

620
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:52,116
I don't have time
to dicker with you, McGuire.

621
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:55,122
That's what the clothes
are worth to us.

622
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,953
I'm gonna take them.

623
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,459
It ain't possible.

624
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:01,155
Thieves beginning to pay.

625
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,493
Now you lay down
right there, McGuire.

626
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,035
Yes, sir... Yes, ma'am.

627
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,967
And don't you move.

628
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,836
...until you've counted up to 5,000.

629
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,772
Start counting, McGuire.

630
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:15,707
One prairie doggy...

631
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:17,541
...two prairie doggies...

632
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,013
...three prairie doggies...

633
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,584
...four prairie doggies...

634
01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:25,654
...five prairie doggies...

635
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,655
...prairie doggies...

636
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,748
...eight prairie doggies...

637
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,486
...nine prairie doggies...

638
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,769
- Pierre.
- Yeah?

639
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,573
This dress...

640
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,375
If the boys should ever find out...

641
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,511
Never in a thousand years.

642
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,984
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

643
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,722
How about a dance
with the girl, partner?

644
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,302
My name's McCormack.
Glad to know you.

645
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,098
I got a flask on me.

646
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,105
What say we make a trade
on this next dance?

647
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,697
How do we swap partners?

648
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,639
Mine's that ranger girl with the red top.

649
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,075
Not much on looks...

650
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,874
...but a Cayuse doesn't
cover ground on its looks.

651
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:35,109
Bill, she will rock you to sleep.

652
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,801
Who's your friend?

653
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,429
You don't know him?

654
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,939
Not any more than I do you.

655
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,100
I've been riding the range
around here for years.

656
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,837
He's new to these parts.

657
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,537
If I have ever glimpsed him before...

658
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,274
I'd remember it.

659
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,043
He'd be a bad man in a mix, huh?

660
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,745
Oh, look.
It's the Barneses.

661
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:15,551
...and that gal that's visiting them.

662
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,626
...from out East.

663
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,399
McGurk!

664
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,068
Haircut? Fifty cents.

665
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,537
A shave? Ten.

666
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,482
Shave.

667
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:30,584
Guess you wanna brush up
on the hearsay.

668
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,860
That fella just left.

669
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,161
...told me an interesting story
about the... The night.

670
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,794
Red Pierre shot Bob McGurk.

671
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:46,164
A case of cold-blooded revenge.

672
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:50,268
All stemmed from an incident
about 20 years ago.

673
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,370
Had to do with a woman...

674
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,381
...named Irene Melody.

675
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,711
Yeah.

676
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:59,117
You heard of her?

677
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:02,588
Her father made something in mines.

678
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:05,456
How many millions, though,
I'd hate to guess.

679
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,461
Well, anyway, along comes this...

680
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:11,055
...this smooth-talking Eastern
gent named... Named Bob McGurk.

681
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:12,566
Yeah.

682
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:15,762
Now, I... I ain't never even seen
so much as his picture, though...

683
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:19,398
...but they say he was
an unnatural-looking man.

684
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,635
The strangest...
strangest-looking face.

685
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,269
Well, he come up this way.

686
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,907
First thing straight off,
he sees this Irene Melody, of course...

687
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,951
...and he made a pretty big play for her...

688
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,815
which thrilled her father.

689
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,548
Well, being so smooth in the tongue...

690
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,385
...he finally got things fixed.

691
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,391
The girl's father had agreed.

692
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,791
...she should marry him.

693
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:43,126
But Irene didn't wanna marry him.

694
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,895
She was in love
with a fella named Mart Ryder.

695
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,302
Well, the problem was.

696
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:53,898
Mart was already married.

697
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,410
Rascal.

698
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,742
Well, one night...

699
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:01,442
McGurk and his gang...

700
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,815
...they see Mart leave town early.

701
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,649
...and ride away...

702
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,656
...and they follow him.

703
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,726
...over the hill to Irene's house.

704
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,226
They grabbed this fella...

705
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,889
...and they fixing on beating on him...

706
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,626
...giving him a beating he'll never forget.

707
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,427
Oh, this is where.

708
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,734
...the story gets all queer.

709
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,207
This fella wasn't the fella
they thunk he was.

710
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,709
This fella.

711
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:32,178
was an old friend of Irene's.

712
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:35,273
who had traveled
hundreds of miles to see her.

713
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:39,218
...before he packed up
his accordion off to New York.

714
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,261
Of course,
Irene didn't say nothing.

715
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,595
She was trying to protect Mart.

716
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,531
And that brings us.

717
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:56,366
...to how we started this discourse...

718
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,667
...the shooting of Bob McGurk.

719
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,332
...by Red Pierre.

720
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,310
McGurk was defeated.

721
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,246
...for the first time.

722
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,375
His charm was broken.

723
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,649
And soon after,
Boone's gang arrived.

724
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,849
The boys opened up
with their gats on them.

725
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:19,587
They chased him
right on out of the town.

726
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:23,153
They must've sunk
one of their bullets in him.

727
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,665
About a week later...

728
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,260
...a blind Indian woman
comes across a body.

729
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,272
Pretty bad shape.
Probably ate up by wolves.

730
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,343
...or coyotes or something.

731
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,072
It must've been McGurk's body.

732
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,081
And that was the end of that.

733
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:57,054
And this Red Pierre...
I suppose he's dead.

734
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,600
Dead? Him? Of course not.

735
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,170
The bullets hit him fair and square...

736
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,707
...but they... They ricocheted
off around his body.

737
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,503
...almost magic-like.

738
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,493
What?

739
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,962
What's wrong?

740
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,211
Well?

741
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:00,813
I don't know, son.
I'm just... I'm weary.

742
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:04,408
I'm weary with the kind of tired you...

743
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,421
...you just can't cure by sleeping.

744
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,354
You understand?

745
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:11,085
It's Patterson.

746
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,161
He didn't come home.

747
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,297
I said that when we found him.

748
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:28,408
A man that saves
a shipwrecked fella...

749
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,913
...he gets bad luck for his thanks.

750
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,483
You've been croaking
for two years.

751
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,884
...about the bad luck that I'm gonna
bring Jim for saving me.

752
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,888
Never happened, has it?

753
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,457
No?

754
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,888
Where's Patterson?

755
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,693
See him?

756
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,201
What, I'm responsible if the blockhead
got drunk someplace?

757
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:58,205
Patterson knew we were
starting up again today.

758
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,969
- He knew it.
- Ain't no doubt about it, Gandil.

759
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,907
And that is the straight dope.

760
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,842
Patterson never misses his dates.

761
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,211
Shut up, the whole gang, you.

762
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,615
We've had luck the two years
Pierre's been with us.

763
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,210
Who calls him a Jonah?

764
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,620
I do.

765
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,084
He's a goddamn Jonah.

766
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,030
I sailed the high seas.

767
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,123
I know bad luck when I see it...

768
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,099
...and you, mister...

769
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:30,035
...are bad luck.

770
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,972
The worst storms at sea.

771
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:36,203
...come when the ship sets sail.

772
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,541
...in fair weather.

773
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,572
Patterson...

774
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,082
Where is he?

775
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,212
Huh?

776
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:50,257
He's gone, Jim.

777
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:53,226
He ain't just delayed.

778
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,627
He's gone. He's dead.

779
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:59,930
He's the first one...

780
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,798
...but he's not the last.

781
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,496
He's just a start.

782
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:07,536
He's just a start.

783
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,211
Who's gonna be the next dead man.

784
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:16,648
...because of Mr. Red Pierre?

785
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:22,715
Is it you, Rodrigo?

786
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,419
Phil?

787
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,894
Dick?

788
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,001
I don't wanna take that chance.

789
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,404
Jim...

790
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,070
...are you a dead man?

791
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,340
Hell...

792
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,546
...it could even be me.

793
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,881
What makes you think
you know trouble's coming...

794
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,756
Gandil?

795
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,728
Because my blood runs cold in me.

796
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,800
when I look at you.

797
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,467
I've put up with your croaking
for too long.

798
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:13,769
Not gonna do it anymore.
Too long, you understand?

799
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,780
I'll be croaking.

800
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,743
And I'll keep on croaking.

801
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,843
...until you're gone.

802
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:29,219
- You shrewd about that?
- Don't answer him, Pierre.

803
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,417
You, Gandil...

804
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,859
...shut your face,
or I'll break you in two.

805
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,488
Try it.

806
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,463
Come on, Jim. Try it!

807
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,366
Keep out of it.

808
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,439
This is my party.

809
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:52,273
You'll stop your jabbering.

810
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:55,441
- Know why, Gandil?
- Why is that?

811
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,920
'Cause that cold in your blood...

812
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,925
...that's part hate...

813
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,860
...but it's more fear.

814
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,931
Ándale, Rodrigo.

815
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,208
Oh, God.

816
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,340
A bunch of bullshit.

817
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,606
Hey, you're about to get stung there...

818
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,266
Rodrigo.

819
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,469
- What?
- Jim...

820
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,103
Look over there
at that wasp there, see?

821
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:01,375
He's telling a story.

822
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,417
What's he say?

823
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,713
Look at it. See?
Look how he's flying there.

824
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,516
Look. See?

825
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,090
He's, uh...

826
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:12,388
He's sending word off
to the other wasps.

827
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:14,189
while he's flying there.

828
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:18,096
See that little bitty
twisty circle there?

829
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,100
That means one thing.
And then all the...

830
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,931
That big old perfect circle
right there...

831
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,629
...that means something else, see?

832
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,401
He's sending word off to his gang.

833
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,941
Yeah, he is.

834
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,238
And what is the message?

835
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,713
You're about to get stung.

836
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,750
Where do you come up with that?

837
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:38,251
I didn't come up with it.

838
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,911
I just know it.

839
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:42,354
How do you just know it?

840
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:46,393
Rodrigo, it's just something I know.

841
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,293
You been around bees as much as I have,
you get to know them.

842
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,764
You raise hell enough.

843
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,733
Now let's go get Jack
and ask her for that dance, huh?

844
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,410
The good days are done.

845
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:07,912
He'll never rest
till one of them is dead.

846
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,916
And then the others will take sides...

847
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,452
...and there'll be gunplay tonight.

848
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:20,292
Two years...

849
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,363
...and then the breakup.

850
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:27,895
Wipe that wolf look off your face.

851
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,561
Jack's a woman...

852
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,571
...not a gunfighter.

853
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:36,476
Grace up.
I got news for you.

854
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,240
I brought Pierre here to tell you about it.

855
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,847
What?

856
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,883
There's a dance
down at the Barnes' place...

857
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:56,259
...and Pierre wants you to go with him.

858
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,093
Pierre?

859
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,030
Yeah, Dick's lost his head
about some girl from the East...

860
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:05,231
...and he wants me to go and see her.

861
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,571
He thought that you might want
to come along.

862
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:12,780
I guess.

863
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:17,278
It's a masquerade.

864
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,785
We need clothes.

865
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,788
When did you spend time.

866
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:24,085
with this wasp?

867
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:26,592
Let's just say
I've been around them.

868
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,558
What do you mean by that?

869
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,362
I don't need to explain it.

870
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:40,067
Okay. Okay. I see.

871
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:44,173
You know what he's saying now?

872
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:45,871
- What?
- He's saying...

873
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,472
"Fir branch,
Rodrigo's going to shoot me. "

874
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:49,982
Yeah?

875
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,110
Well, you couldn't hit him
in a million years.

876
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,188
- Watch me.
- You'll never hit him.

877
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,189
I've seen how you shoot.

878
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:59,317
- You got the money to cover that bet?
- I don't need it.

879
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,486
You're not gonna hit him.

880
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,537
You hear what I'm saying?

881
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,238
I told you.
You couldn't hit shit.

882
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,373
You're terrible.

883
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,452
You know what I say?

884
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,248
What?

885
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,981
What do you say, Rodrigo?

886
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,353
I'm going to shoot you.

887
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,052
Yeah, right.
Well, with the way you shoot...

888
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,994
I better give you my gun, too.

889
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:38,031
...chingada.

890
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,863
"Chingada. "

891
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,803
I thought you two were at it now.

892
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,501
We are about to go at it.

893
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:52,774
Yeah, well, knock it off,
both of you.

894
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,712
We got enough trouble
with Gandil and Red.

895
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,011
All right. We're sorry, chief.

896
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,733
Two years, McGurk was gone.

897
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,963
Wasn't a whisper of his name.

898
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,131
Then he came back
and went on the trail of Pierre.

899
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:56,335
Whatever it was
kept him away for those years...

900
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,641
...the memory of that wound
he received at Gaffney's place...

901
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:00,737
...that never left him.

902
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:30,472
Uh, it's too late for business.
I'm a-closing up.

903
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,876
We're going to a bit of a dance.

904
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:35,779
We'll take those evening clothes.

905
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,359
Look.

906
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:58,763
What do we say?
We were dancing?

907
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,850
How do we swap partners?

908
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:46,750
Mine's that ranger girl
with the red top.

909
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,254
Not much on looks...

910
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:51,086
...but a Cayuse doesn't
cover ground on his looks.

911
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,184
Bill, she will rock you to sleep.

912
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:00,131
I could kill you right now...

913
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:02,362
...but I'd rather wait.

914
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,735
Who's your friend?

915
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:13,245
You don't know him?

916
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,781
Not anymore than I do you.

917
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,976
I've been riding the range
around here for years.

918
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:18,746
He's new to these parts.

919
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:20,548
If I have ever glimpsed him before...

920
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,179
I'd remember it.

921
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:24,019
He'd be a bad man in a mix, huh?

922
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,142
Let me mark your face,
you coward.

923
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,613
Is that... Is that Red Pierre?

924
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,494
What have you gone and done?

925
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,762
Wow.

926
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,337
Look at you.

927
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,978
What do you think?

928
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:03,107
Wow.

929
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:07,245
Find you sitting here
all by your lonesome.

930
01:27:09,524 --> 01:27:11,651
Yeah, that's water.

931
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,659
All right.
So, I'll take the first sip.

932
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:25,738
It was delicious.

933
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,774
You want a sip? Do you?

934
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,433
Not the mouth.

935
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:31,842
Just right there. Yeah.

936
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,687
Yeah, I'm gonna take another.

937
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:46,058
Yeah.

938
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,287
Yeah, let's get rid of all this.

939
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:55,101
Well, that was fun.

940
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:01,767
You know what I'm thinking?

941
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:04,276
I'm thinking you should've killed me.

942
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:06,643
when you had a chance.

943
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:09,513
Damn you, Gandil.

944
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:13,018
Me? Don't damn me.

945
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,089
You should damn that Jonah luck.

946
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,817
...you brought into Jim Boone.

947
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:20,553
...and the gang.

948
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,857
That's who you should damn.

949
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,330
Oh, if you haven't heard...

950
01:28:25,433 --> 01:28:27,333
...they're dead.

951
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,401
All of them.

952
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,975
Gone.

953
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:38,341
Just the buzzards to bury them.

954
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,841
Tragedy.

955
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,647
Now...

956
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:50,019
...you're gonna get your turn to die.

957
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:51,489
I'm gonna help you.

958
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:53,389
I think I'm the right man
for the job.

959
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,724
See...

960
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:59,926
I am going to kill you dead.

961
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:11,268
That's what we're gonna do.

962
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,342
You know, Gandil, you were always.

963
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:19,045
...spotting off about
how fast you pull a gun...

964
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:21,212
...how straight you shoot.

965
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:23,222
What of it?

966
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:26,559
Why don't you give me a break?

967
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,458
Make it even.

968
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:32,330
We'll try you out.

969
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:42,075
I'm not a fool, Pierre.

970
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,847
But still...

971
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:51,981
I won't go at you unarmed
and murder you.

972
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:55,846
I'll make an equal match of it.

973
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:59,654
Give you a fighting chance,
'cause that's who I am.

974
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:07,598
Now let's get your ass up.
Come on.

975
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:09,727
Get up. Get up.

976
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:11,964
Yes.

977
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,506
Yeah, you see?

978
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:16,406
Because I face
my challenges head-on.

979
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:20,447
...like a train going down the tracks.

980
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:25,111
I love trains.

981
01:30:26,187 --> 01:30:29,588
Robbing... Trains.

982
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,784
Yeah. Yeah.

983
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,363
Remember this?

984
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,298
Do you?

985
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:43,563
Yeah, you do, don't you?

986
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:45,138
Yeah.

987
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:51,001
There you go.

988
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:54,013
Now...

989
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,049
we're even.

990
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,518
Even for who?

991
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,523
For me, you dumbass.

992
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,718
You're gonna die.

993
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:09,490
Oh, and as you do that,
I want you to know

994
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:12,430
...that that goddamn Jonah luck...

995
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,763
...it's gonna dissolve into the smoke...

996
01:31:14,869 --> 01:31:16,530
...it's gonna disappear.

997
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,935
You see, the way it works...

998
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,134
When you die...

999
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:24,370
...it dies with you.

1000
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,517
So let's go ahead
and get this thing going.

1001
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,184
One...

1002
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:41,488
...two...

1003
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,120
...thr...

1004
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:48,592
Four...

1005
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:50,170
...five...

1006
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,034
...six...

1007
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,437
...seven...

1008
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,533
...eight...

1009
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:58,635
...nine, ten.

1010
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,779
All right...

1011
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:07,184
Red Pierre.

1012
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:12,692
Go ahead and draw first.

1013
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:14,556
When you're ready, Gandil.

1014
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,857
Make the first move.

1015
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:20,264
I've never formed a habit.

1016
01:32:31,913 --> 01:32:34,211
How'd you do that?

1017
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:25,788
Hola, amigo.

1018
01:33:50,524 --> 01:33:52,492
Seems you've been through it all right.

1019
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:57,655
Yeah.

1020
01:33:57,765 --> 01:33:59,699
I've been through it.

1021
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:16,478
I said, who are you?

1022
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:19,585
I'm Red Pierre.

1023
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:27,059
Red Pierre, huh?

1024
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,335
There's a price on your head, you know?

1025
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,262
There's a man.

1026
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:07,630
who wants to meet you.

1027
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:11,895
What man?

1028
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:14,941
A gringo with a white horse.

1029
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:18,708
Where is he?

1030
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:22,044
He said you'd know.

1031
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,358
Well, it's only square.

1032
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:45,701
The devil will know.

1033
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:31,376
Get off that.

1034
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:40,387
You ready to die, McGurk?

1035
01:37:40,487 --> 01:37:42,478
What man isn't?

1036
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:44,490
I just wonder how one death
can repay back.

1037
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:46,560
...all you've done.

1038
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:12,745
I want you to die, McGurk.

1039
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:14,980
Is that all you want?

1040
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:16,317
No.

1041
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:18,482
I want you to die
knowing that another man.

1042
01:38:18,592 --> 01:38:20,560
was faster on the draw
and straighter with his bullets.

1043
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,458
...than you are.

1044
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,366
Listen.
Your horse grows restive.

1045
01:39:36,670 --> 01:39:40,003
Perhaps we stand here and wait...

1046
01:39:40,107 --> 01:39:43,008
with our arms folded...

1047
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:47,046
...till the next time your horse
paws the rocks.

1048
01:41:50,037 --> 01:41:52,005
Where's your gun?

1049
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,448
There's mine.

1050
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:04,881
Let's do better now.

1051
01:42:38,919 --> 01:42:40,819
You can't move.

1052
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:42,889
I understand.

1053
01:42:46,126 --> 01:42:48,185
You see, it's fear
that stiffens your back.

1054
01:42:48,295 --> 01:42:50,354
...and runs chills
up and down your blood.

1055
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:53,331
It's fear that makes you think back
to all your murders, McGurk...

1056
01:42:53,433 --> 01:42:56,493
...one by one.

1057
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:59,231
You're done for, McGurk.

1058
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:02,937
You're through.

1059
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,256
I could kill you right now...

1060
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:24,625
...but there wouldn't be any
lasting satisfaction in that.

1061
01:43:39,513 --> 01:43:42,676
Mart...

1062
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:44,808
...his father is...

1063
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:46,818
...is...

1064
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,514
Bob McGurk.

1065
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:06,803
Boy's mine.

1066
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:10,139
You can go.

1067
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:15,476
Go!

1068
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:25,358
Now get out.

1069
01:46:29,683 --> 01:46:31,583
Swear to me, Pierre...

1070
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:33,676
...you will no longer abuse its power.

1071
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:35,584
...after your mission's complete.

1072
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:37,782
I swear.

1073
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:41,394
What are you doing?

1074
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:49,092
This cross has power.

1075
01:46:49,202 --> 01:46:51,170
And Gandil's wrong.

1076
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:58,408
Ma'am, You're going to die.

1077
01:46:59,613 --> 01:47:02,446
Behave, for the love of your life.

1078
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:08,591
4,998 prairie doggies...

1079
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:10,932
To hell with this.
