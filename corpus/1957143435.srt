01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:49,453
If you were doing it her way,
you'd be locked up forever.

911
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:51,823
No Frank, no life, no hope.

912
01:13:51,857 --> 01:13:52,858
Look at her.

913
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:55,661
Darn it, look at her.

01:13:55,694 --> 01:13:57,596
Let that image burn in.

915
01:13:58,563 --> 01:13:59,731
You know why?

916
01:13:59,765 --> 01:14:00,899
'Cause she'd do it again.

Do it, Kat.

919
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:10,542
Do it.

924
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:42,007
You did the right thing.

925
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,041
Proud of you.

926
01:14:44,743 --> 01:14:45,744
Hey.

927
01:14:47,746 --> 01:14:49,614
I'm going to get Vegas.

928
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,249
I trust I can leave
you two, right?

929
01:15:00,258 --> 01:15:05,197
So I'm thinking me and you
have some unfinished business.

930
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:07,866
What do we do now?

931
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:09,167
I won't live this life.

932
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:11,737
But I won't stand in your way.

933
01:15:14,006 --> 01:15:15,640
I won't run forever.

934
01:15:22,748 --> 01:15:24,282
What if you could?

935
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,721
