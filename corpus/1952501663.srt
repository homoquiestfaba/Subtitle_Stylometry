1
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,841
Going down?

2
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,854
She Ioves me!

3
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:42,591
HeIIo, IittIe kitty! This is
your oId UncIe DudIey again.

4
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,394
Say, do you know what week this is?

5
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,871
It's Be IKind to AnimaIs Week.

6
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,033
You are kind to animaIs, aren't you?

7
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,937
Why, of course you are!

8
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:02,248
But this week, you'II be extra kind.

9
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:03,713
Won't you?

10
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,549
Come on!

11
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,279
PIease?

12
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,850
Just this week?

13
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,258
That's the spirit! Let's do it now!

14
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,049
And now, before your
oId UncIe DudIey says goodbye...

15
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,147
...did you get a nice IittIe surprise...

16
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:08,084
...for your IittIe animaI friend?

17
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,523
You did?

18
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,418
WeII, Iet him have it!

19
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:12,108
That's my boy!

20
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,442
You know son, now that
you're grown up...

21
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:22,851
...it's time we had a heart-to-heart
taIk about the facts of Iife.

22
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,060
First of aII, you're a dog...

23
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:29,491
...and there's three things a
dog's gotta know how to do.

24
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,191
First, a dog's gotta know
how to be man's best friend.

25
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:37,234
That comes in two easy positions:

26
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:39,367
The Begging Position...

27
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,371
...with the big, sad, souIfuI eyes.

28
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:47,447
And the Lying-at-
the-Master's-Feet Position...

29
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,948
...aIso with the big,
sad, souIfuI eyes.

30
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:59,090
Now, the second thing
a dog has to know is how to bury bones.

31
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:00,225
Why?

32
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:01,554
I don't know!

33
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:04,731
I can never find them
after I bury them!

34
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,936
But that's what dogs
is supposed to do.

35
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,866
Third, and most important:

36
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,974
AII dogs gotta know
how to chase cats...

37
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,338
...which happens to be my speciaIty.

38
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,378
Now, if we had a cat--

39
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:35,956
What a coincidence!

40
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:37,221
Watch me.

41
00:28:37,432 --> 00:28:40,526
This aIways scares them
out of their skin.

42
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:12,528
Want to try it, son?

43
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,002
I'II be right back.

44
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,763
I gotta have a taIk
with this character.

45
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:23,701
Listen, pussycat.

46
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,970
My boy's Iearning to chase cats.

47
00:29:26,214 --> 00:29:29,479
And I don't want him
to have any troubIe, understand?

48
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,983
When he starts barking, you start
cIimbing.

49
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,849
Is that cIear?

50
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:39,283
Okay, then. Let's go.

51
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,799
Okay, son, it's your turn now.

52
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:50,697
Nice work, boy!

53
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:53,567
Hey, the kid ain't joshing!
Look at that.

54
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:05,248
A chip off of that oId bIock!

55
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:09,651
That's what you are, son,
a chip off of that oId bIock.

56
00:30:39,621 --> 00:30:42,488
That's my boy! Yes, sir!

57
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,121
You did it again, son!

58
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:43,900
What happened, son?
Are you aII right?

59
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:46,239
Say something! Speak to me!

60
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,244
Speak to me, boy!

61
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,982
Who done it?

62
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:00,885
That's aII I want to know.

63
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,611
Okay, son.

64
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,846
Take it from here.

65
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:41,729
That's my boy doing that.

66
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:05,857
Mama!

67
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:07,825
Mama!

68
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:24,945
I can't swim.

69
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,171
Nobody Iikes me.

70
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,173
I don't know why.

71
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,473
I try and try and try...

72
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:30,411
...but I can't swim!

73
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:32,250
I can't heIp it.

74
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:36,183
I try and try and try.

75
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:38,857
Nobody Iikes me.

76
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:42,327
I wish I couId swim.

77
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:45,564
HeIp!

78
00:49:47,768 --> 00:49:48,996
HeIp!

79
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:04,775
HeIp!

80
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,262
HeIp!

81
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:13,511
I can't swim.

82
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:22,477
HeIp!

83
00:52:23,323 --> 00:52:25,848
Somebody, heIp!

84
01:03:50,142 --> 01:03:51,632
Tom Cat?

85
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:55,208
Jerry Mouse?

86
01:03:55,848 --> 01:03:58,214
Tom and Jerry?

87
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,311
You...

88
01:04:02,555 --> 01:04:03,647
...him.

89
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:10,527
Funny cartoons!

90
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:14,864
You turista ?

91
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,499
Andiamo ! I show you NapoIi.

92
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:02,569
Here, e il Teatro San Carlo.

93
01:05:05,718 --> 01:05:09,449
Way over there e il Vesuvio.

94
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,988
And here is Nisida.

95
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:18,922
Isn't it beautifuI?

96
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:23,531
Senti. Senti !

97
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:10,542
I'm sorry.

98
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:14,817
I aIways cry when I sing that song.

99
01:17:25,023 --> 01:17:26,217
How!
