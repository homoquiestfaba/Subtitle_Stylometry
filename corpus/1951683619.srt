1
00:00:15,028 --> 00:00:16,893
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:20,456
You know, Kiddo...
.

3
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,962
I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:27,031
you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:33,413
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

6
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:35,904
At this moment,
.

7
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:39,817
this is me...

8
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,783
at my most masochistic.

9
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:45,050
Bill,
.

10
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,791
it's your baby...

11
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,561
Looked dead, didn't I?

12
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:56,433
Well, I wasn't.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,437
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,334
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma,

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,911
a coma I was to lie in
for four years.

16
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,846
When I woke up,

17
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,877
I went on what the movie
advertisements refer to as:

18
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,045
"A roaring ram page of revenge. "

19
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:18,581
I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,455
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:25,593
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,393
but I have only one more,

23
00:01:29,636 --> 00:01:31,035
the last one,

24
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,206
the one I'm driving to right now,

25
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,570
the only one left.

26
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:41,009
And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:41,982 --> 00:01:44,951
I am going to kill Bill.

28
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:13,838
Now,, the incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel,,

29
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,108
that put this whole
gory story into motion,,

30
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,684
has since become legend.

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,580
"Massacre at Two Pines. "

32
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,587
That's what the
newspapers called it.

33
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,555
The local TV news called it:

34
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:30,561
"The El Paso,
.
Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre. "

35
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,425
How it happened,, who was there,,

36
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:36,365
how many got killed
and who killed them...

37
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:39,870
changes depending on
who 's telling the story.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,730
In actual fact,
.

39
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,742
the massacre didn't happen
during a wedding at all.

40
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,910
It was a wedding rehearsal.

41
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,614
Now, when we come to the part
where I say...

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,014
"You may kiss the bride, "

43
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,880
you may kiss the bride.

44
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,455
But don't stick
your tongue in her mouth.

45
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,652
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,992
but it would be
embarrassing to your parents.

47
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:09,158
We'll try to restrain
ourselves, Reverend.

48
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,666
Y'all got a song?

49
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:19,344
How about "Love Me Tender "?
I can play that.

50
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:20,939
Sure.

51
00:03:21,882 --> 00:03:23,747
"Love Me Tender " would be great.

52
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,376
Rufus, he's the man.

53
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,412
Rufus, who was that
you used to play for?

54
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,218
Rufus Thomas.

55
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,253
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:35,456
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:39,861
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,527
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Bar-Kay.

59
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,197
If they come through Texas,
I played with them.

60
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:51,305
Rufus, he's the man.

61
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:55,779
Have I forgotten anything?

62
00:03:55,916 --> 00:04:00,182
Um, oh yes, you forgot
the seating arrangements.

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,981
Thank you, Mother.

64
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:05,216
Now, the way we normally do this,

65
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,656
we have the bride's side,

66
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:09,386
and then we have the
groom's side.

67
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:12,692
But since the bride
ain't got nobody coming,

68
00:04:12,832 --> 00:04:16,825
and the groom's got
far too many people coming...

69
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,461
Oh yeah, they're coming
all the way from Oklahoma.

70
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,667
Right.

71
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,703
Well, I don't see
no problem with...

72
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,513
the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

73
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,482
- Do you, Mother?
-No, I don't have a problem with that.

74
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,985
But, honey, you know,

75
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,386
it would be good
if you had somebody come.

76
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,089
You know, as a sign of good faith.

77
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,764
Well, I don't have anybody...

78
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,862
except for Tommy and...

79
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,465
my friends.

80
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:51,236
You have no family?

81
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,395
Well, I'm working on changing that.

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,438
Mrs. Harmony,

83
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,566
we're all the family this
little angel's ever going to need.

84
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:00,806
I'm not feeling very well,

85
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:03,507
and this bitch
is starting to piss me off.

86
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,140
So while you all blather on,

87
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,775
I'm going to go outside
and get some air.

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,978
Okay.

89
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:10,179
Reverend, sorry, ah...

90
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,654
She's going to go out
and get some air.

91
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,918
Yeah, given her
delicate condition...

92
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,722
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together, she'll be okay.

93
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,257
all right.

94
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:37,640
Hello, Kiddo.

95
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,609
How did you find me?

96
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,375
I'm the man.

97
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:52,916
What are you doing here?

98
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,294
What am I doing?

99
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:59,357
Well,

100
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,426
a moment ago
I was playing my flute.

101
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,276
At this moment,

102
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,938
I'm looking at
the most beautiful bride...

103
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,379
these old eyes have ever seen.

104
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,846
Why are you here?

105
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:22,816
Last look.

106
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:26,891
Are you going to be nice?

107
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:29,859
I've never been nice
my whole life.

108
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:34,530
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

109
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,634
I always told you,

110
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,333
your sweet side is your best side.

111
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,209
I guess that's why...

112
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:47,069
you're the only one
who's ever seen it.

113
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,582
See you got a bun in the oven.

114
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,583
I'm knocked-up.

115
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,421
Jeez, Louise.

116
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:00,915
That young man of yours...

117
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,723
sure doesn't believe in
wasting time, does he?

118
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:07,598
Have you seen Tommy?

119
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,799
Big guy in the tux?

120
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:13,133
Yes.

121
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,034
Then I saw him.

122
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,167
I like his hair.

123
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,447
You promised you'd be nice.

124
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:28,083
No, I said I'd do my best,
that's hardly a prom ise.

125
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,512
But you're right.

126
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,587
What does your young man
do for a living?

127
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:39,129
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

128
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,824
Ah, music Iover, eh?

129
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,993
He's fond of m usic.

130
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,570
Aren't we all.

131
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:54,946
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

132
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,781
I work in the record store.

133
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,543
Ahh so.

134
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:05,957
It all suddenly seems so clear.

135
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:09,960
Do you like it?

136
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:13,459
Yeah, I like it a lot, smart-ass.

137
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,667
I get to listen to music all day,

138
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,805
talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

139
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:25,269
It's going to be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

140
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:31,081
As opposed to
jetting around the world,

141
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:32,912
killing human beings,

142
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,816
and being paid vast sums of money?

143
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,189
Precisely.

144
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,859
Well, my old friend, to each his own.

145
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:45,891
However,

146
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,229
all cockblockery aside,

147
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,236
I am looking forward to
meeting your young man.

148
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,875
I happen to be
more or Iess particular...

149
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,170
whom my gal marries.

150
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,303
You want to come to the wedding?

151
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:05,008
Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

152
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:08,677
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

153
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:12,182
Your side always was a bit lonely,

154
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:15,156
but I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

155
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:18,926
You know,

156
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:22,264
I had the Ioveliest dream about you.

157
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:24,734
Oh, here's Tom my. Call me Arlene.

158
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,005
You must be Tommy.

159
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,506
Arlene's told me so much about you.

160
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:32,406
- Honey, you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

161
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,036
Tommy, I'd like you to
meet my father.

162
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,949
Oh, my God!

163
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,113
Oh, my God, this is great.

164
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:43,188
I'm so glad to meet you, sir.
Oh, Dad.

165
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,213
The name's Bill.

166
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,758
Well, it's great to
meet you, Bill.

167
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,862
Arlene told me you
couldn't make it.

168
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:51,058
Surprise.

169
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:54,394
That's my Pop for you.
AIways full of surprises.

170
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,401
Well, in the surprise department,

171
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:00,733
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

172
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,702
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

173
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:06,071
Did you come
straight from Australia?

174
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:06,871
Of course.

175
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:10,471
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver and...

176
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,680
no one could reach you.

177
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:16,183
Lucky for us all,
that's not the case.

178
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:17,613
So...

179
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:20,116
what's this all about?

180
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,227
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

181
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:24,557
but I don't believe
I've ever heard of...

182
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:26,631
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

183
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:27,858
We thought:

184
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:31,198
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only going to wear once? "

185
00:11:31,337 --> 00:11:34,272
Especially when Arlene looks so
goddam n beautiful in it.

186
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:38,036
So, I think we're going to try to
get all the mileage we can out of it.

187
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:41,079
Isn't it supposed to be bad Iuck...

188
00:11:41,214 --> 00:11:44,445
for the groom to see the bride
in her wedding dress...

189
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:45,949
before the ceremony?

190
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:50,315
Well, I guess I just
believe in living dangerously.

191
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,989
I know just what you mean.

192
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,458
Son.

193
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:58,990
- Some of us have places to be.
- Sure do.

194
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:01,630
Look, we got to go through this
one more time.

195
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,702
So, why don't you have a se...

196
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,738
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away.

197
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:11,071
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

198
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,043
I think Father would be
much more comfortable...

199
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,646
sitting with the rest of the guests.

200
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:17,181
Oh, really?

201
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,315
That's asking a lot.

202
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,649
Well, okay, we'll forget it.

203
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,384
But how about we go out to dinner
tonight and celebrate.

204
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:29,222
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

205
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:31,762
Deal. We got to do this now.

206
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,989
Can I watch?

207
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,327
Absolutely. Have a seat.

208
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,661
Which is the bride's side?

209
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:39,294
Right over here.

210
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:44,633
Mother, here we go.

211
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:49,337
Now, son, about them vows...

212
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:56,946
Bill,

213
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:58,919
I just wanted...

214
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,788
You don't owe me a damn thing.

215
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,759
If he's the man you want,

216
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,227
then go stand by him.

217
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,549
Do I look pretty?

218
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,657
Oh, yes.

219
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,105
Thank you.

220
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,906
Oh, good.

221
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:23,466
It's all much more simp...

222
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,668
What the hell?!

223
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:28,878
No! Bill!

224
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,642
You're telling me...

225
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:12,224
she cut her way through
88 bodyguards...

226
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,983
before she got to O-Ren?

227
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:16,026
No, there wasn't really 88 of them.

228
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,960
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88. "

229
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:19,792
How come?

230
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:22,833
I don't know. I guess
they thought it sounded cool.

231
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,370
Anyhow,

232
00:15:25,872 --> 00:15:28,136
they all fell under her Hanzo sword.

233
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,136
She's got a Hanzo sword?

234
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:32,172
He made one for her.

235
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,712
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

236
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:39,346
It would appear he has broken it.

237
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:45,057
Them Japs sure know how to
hold a grudge, don't they?

238
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,193
Or maybe...

239
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,564
you just tend to
bring that out in people.

240
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:57,026
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask it,

241
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,137
but you haven't, by any chance,

242
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:02,264
kept up with your swordplay?

243
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,868
I...

244
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:10,315
I pawned that years ago.

245
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:13,910
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

246
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,778
Yep.

247
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:18,114
It was priceless.

248
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,858
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

249
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,193
In El Paso I got me $250 for it.

250
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,431
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

251
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:38,867
If she wants to fight with me,

252
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,842
all she's got to do is
come down to the club,

253
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,312
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

254
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:49,377
I know we haven't spoken
in some time.

255
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:53,157
And the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

256
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:57,551
but you've got to get over
being mad at me...

257
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,656
and start becom ing
afraid of (BLEEP)...

258
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,027
because she is coming,

259
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,329
and she is coming to kill you.

260
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,270
And unless you accept my assistance,

261
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:10,000
I have no doubt she will succeed.

262
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:20,548
I don't dodge guilt,

263
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:23,917
and I don't Jew out of
paying my comeuppance.

264
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:29,494
Can't we just forget the past?

265
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:33,798
That woman...

266
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,460
deserves her revenge,

267
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,533
and we deserve to die.

268
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,310
But then again,

269
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:54,951
so does she.

270
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,653
So I guess...

271
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,720
we'll just see,

272
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:06,291
won't we?

273
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:44,762
Late again.

274
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,438
Budd, can't you tell time?

275
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,706
There ain't nobody in here, man.

276
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,834
- Is that Budd?!
- Yeah!

277
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:55,979
Tell him to get his
fucking ass back here!

278
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,412
Okay.

279
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,314
Budd, Larry would like
a word with you.

280
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,226
Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

281
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:20,267
You looking for me?

282
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:30,074
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here,

283
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:32,275
that let you stroll in 20 m inutes Iate,

284
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:35,251
but it wasn't owned by me,
and I own a fucking car wash.

285
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:36,319
Do you want me to leave?

286
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,753
No, I don't want you to leave,
I want you to sit and wait.

287
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:40,820
Larry,

288
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:44,219
there ain't nobody out there, so...

289
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:49,060
"There's nobody out there, Larry. "

290
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:51,826
What's your point?

291
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,299
That you're not needed here?

292
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,567
My point is...

293
00:19:57,309 --> 00:19:58,936
I'm the bouncer,

294
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:01,911
and there ain't nobody
out there to bounce.

295
00:20:02,047 --> 00:20:03,446
You're saying that the reason...

296
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:10,388
that you're not doing the job
that I'm paying you to do...

297
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:13,822
is that you don't have a job to do?

298
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,154
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

299
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:20,329
What are you trying to
convince me of exactly,

300
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:23,526
that you're as useless as
an asshole right here?

301
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:26,368
Well, guess what, Buddy,

302
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:31,332
I think you just
fucking convinced me.

303
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:36,114
Let's go to the calendar.
It's calendar time.

304
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,706
Calendar time for Buddy.

305
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,012
Okay, you working tomorrow?

306
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:42,776
Yeah.

307
00:20:43,389 --> 00:20:44,856
No, you're not.

308
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:46,955
You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

309
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:49,022
Here. You're not working tomorrow,

310
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:51,994
you're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

311
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,458
- You working Thursday?
- Yeah.

312
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,726
I don't think so.

313
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:57,194
Friday?

314
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,362
I don't... there's your name.

315
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:04,008
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name, okay?

316
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:06,805
Saturday, there used to be your name.

317
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,846
So Monday you're going to...

318
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:10,539
Here, how about...
how about that?

319
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,207
Fucking with your cash
is the only thing...

320
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:15,377
you kids seem to understand. Okay?

321
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,983
Now, I want you to go home
till I call you.

322
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,183
Till I call you.

323
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:25,428
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

324
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,158
And...

325
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,263
the hat.

326
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,762
That fucking hat.

327
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,675
That fucking hat.

328
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:41,336
How many times have I told you,

329
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:44,445
don't wear that fucking hat here?

330
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,709
How many?

331
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,756
Well, customers wear hats.

332
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,358
Well, I'm not the boss
of the customers.

333
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,290
I'm the boss of you.

334
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:58,362
And I'm telling you...

335
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:02,831
that I want you to keep that
shit-kicker hat at home.

336
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,995
Yeah, Budd, honey,
the toilet is at it again.

337
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,608
There's shitty water
all over the floor.

338
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,437
Okay...

339
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:47,738
Rocket.

340
00:22:49,882 --> 00:22:51,315
I'll clean it up.

341
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:34,972
Well, that gentled you down some,
didn't it?

342
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:46,077
Yep.

343
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:51,347
Ain't nobody a badass with a
double dose of rock salt...

344
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,653
dug deep in their tits.

345
00:26:57,896 --> 00:26:59,022
Not having...

346
00:27:00,365 --> 00:27:01,559
tits...

347
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,368
as fine...

348
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,403
or as big as yours,

349
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,574
I can't even imagine how bad
that shit must sting.

350
00:27:19,885 --> 00:27:20,715
Yet,

351
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,085
I don't want to neither.

352
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:50,975
I win.

353
00:29:04,022 --> 00:29:04,545
Bill?

354
00:29:05,757 --> 00:29:08,225
Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.

355
00:29:09,027 --> 00:29:10,892
- Budd.
-Bingo.

356
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:15,164
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

357
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:20,497
I just caught me the cowgirl
ain't never been caught.

358
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:23,397
Did you kill her?

359
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:25,667
Well, not yet I ain't.

360
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,541
I shot her full of rock salt.

361
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:30,747
She's so gentle right now,

362
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:33,476
I could perform her
coup de grace with a rock.

363
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:35,712
Anywho,

364
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,789
guess what I'm hold ing
in my hand right now.

365
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:44,395
What?

366
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:48,488
A brand spanking new
Hattori Hanzo sword.

367
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,093
And I'm here to tell you, Elle,

368
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,202
that's what I call sharp.

369
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:56,935
How much?

370
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:59,509
Oh, that's hard to say,
being that it's...

371
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,611
priceless and all.

372
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,447
What's the terms?

373
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:07,350
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...

374
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:11,486
with a m illion dollars
in folding cash,

375
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,383
and I'll give you...

376
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:17,857
the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

377
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,131
Now,, how do you like
the sound of that?

378
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:27,136
Sounds like we got a deal.
One condition.

379
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:28,963
What?

380
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:32,565
She must suffer to her last breath.

381
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:33,904
Well...

382
00:30:35,313 --> 00:30:37,008
that, Elle, darling...

383
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:41,080
I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

384
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:43,777
Then I'll see you
in the morning...

385
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:45,587
millionaire.

386
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,317
all right.

387
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,519
Wakey, wakey.

388
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:52,822
Eggs and bakey.

389
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:29,557
I'm done!

390
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:32,495
Get me out of this hole!

391
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:37,325
Good.

392
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:12,264
Whoa, look at those eyes.

393
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,434
This bitch is furious.

394
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:18,106
What did I tell you?

395
00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:22,875
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

396
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:24,272
Or,

397
00:33:24,816 --> 00:33:27,148
is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

398
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:29,080
I seen better.

399
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,958
You got anything to say?

400
00:33:38,964 --> 00:33:41,899
White wom en call this
"the silent treatment, "

401
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:45,030
and we let them think
we don't like it.

402
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:51,942
You grab the feet,
I'll get the head.

403
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:02,215
Hey, hey. Hey!

404
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:04,986
Wiggle worm.

405
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,354
You see this?

406
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:09,216
You see it, don't you?

407
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:13,521
That's a can of Mace.

408
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:16,497
No.

409
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:19,392
You're going underneath
the ground tonight.

410
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:23,203
And that's all there is to it.

411
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:28,674
I want to bury you.

412
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:33,748
I was going to bury you...

413
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,385
with this.

414
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:48,457
But if you're going to
act like a horse's ass...

415
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:54,836
I'm going to spray
this whole goddam n can...

416
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,607
right in your eyeballs!

417
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:59,266
I'll burn them right out of
your fucking head.

418
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:02,776
Then you're going to be blind,

419
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:05,042
and burning,

420
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:10,048
and buried alive.

421
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,728
Now, what's it going to be, sister?

422
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:30,503
That's a wise decision.

423
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:46,554
This is for breaking
my brother's heart.

424
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:40,180
Once upon a time, in China,

425
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,316
some believe...

426
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:47,796
around the year
one double aught-three,

427
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:53,226
head priest of the
White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei was...

428
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:55,739
walking down a road...

429
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,505
contemplating
whatever it is that...

430
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:04,343
a man of Pai Mei's infinite
powers would contemplate,

431
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,482
which is another way of saying
"Who knows? ",

432
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,648
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

433
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,020
traveling in
the opposite direction.

434
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:18,919
As the monk
and the priest crossed paths,

435
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,262
Pai Mei,

436
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:26,968
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

437
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:31,199
gave the monk
the slightest of nods.

438
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:37,042
The nod was not returned.

439
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,442
Now, was it the intention...

440
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,755
of the Shaolin monk
to insult Pai Mei,

441
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:51,090
or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

442
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,166
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

443
00:40:56,901 --> 00:40:58,232
What is known...

444
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:01,164
were the consequences.

445
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,375
The next morning,

446
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,621
Pai Mei appeared at
the Shaolin temple...

447
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:23,221
and demanded of
the tem ple's head abbot...

448
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:26,159
that he offer Pai Mei his neck...

449
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:28,690
to repay the insult.

450
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:33,764
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei,

451
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:37,405
only to find Pai Mei was...

452
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:40,272
inconsolable.

453
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:53,055
So began...

454
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,552
the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple...

455
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:59,561
and all 60 of the monks inside...

456
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:02,298
at the fists of the White Lotus.

457
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:07,001
And so began the legend...

458
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:11,571
of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

459
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,676
And what, pray tell,

460
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,711
is the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

461
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:16,836
Quite simply,

462
00:42:17,548 --> 00:42:21,314
the deadliest blow
in all of martial arts.

463
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:26,480
He hits you with his fingertips...

464
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,416
at five different
pressure points on your body...

465
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,895
and then lets you walk away.

466
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:37,694
But once you've taken five steps,

467
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:41,596
your heart explodes
inside your body...

468
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:45,369
and you fall to the floor, dead.

469
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,538
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

470
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:51,540
He teaches no one...

471
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:54,845
the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

472
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,578
Now,

473
00:42:57,755 --> 00:43:00,349
one of the things
I've always liked about you,

474
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:02,585
Kiddo,

475
00:43:04,662 --> 00:43:07,756
is you appear wise
beyond your years.

476
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:15,529
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise.

477
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:17,571
Whatever,

478
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:21,835
whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

479
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:25,747
If you flash him,
even for an instant,

480
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,477
a defiant eye,
he'll pluck it out.

481
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:33,112
And if you throw any
American sass his way,

482
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:37,055
he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

483
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,626
And that will be the story of you.

484
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:06,046
He'll accept you as his student.

485
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,158
- What happened to you?
-Nothing.

486
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:11,352
- Get in a fight?
-Friendly contest.

487
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:12,894
Why did he accept me?

488
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,932
Because he's a very,
very, very old man.

489
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:19,801
And like all rotten bastards,

490
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:24,129
when they become old,
they get lonely.

491
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:28,810
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

492
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:32,677
but it does teach them
the value of company.

493
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:40,588
Just seeing those steps again
makes me ache.

494
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:44,188
You're going to have
a lot of fun carrying...

495
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,796
buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

496
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,465
When will I see you again?

497
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:57,205
That's the title of my
favorite soul song of the '70s.

498
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:59,275
- What?
-Nothing.

499
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:01,767
When he tells me you're done.

500
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:04,576
When do you think that might be?

501
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:07,582
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

502
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:11,119
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

503
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,519
At Ieast not for
the first year or so.

504
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,159
You're going to have to
let him warm up to you.

505
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:20,622
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

506
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:23,666
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

507
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:27,365
So in your case...

508
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:31,464
it might take a little while.
Adios.
