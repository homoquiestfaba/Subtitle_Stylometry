GIRL:
Turn, turn. There's the sign.

5
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,399
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
we're finally here.

6
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:34,168
Oh, wait. I told Shane I'd text
him once we're almost there.

7
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:36,003
Oh, Mitchie...

8
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:38,239
What?
Nothing, nothing.

9
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:40,441
Mom, obviously it's something.

10
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,544
I mean, you and subtle
aren't very good friends.

11
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:47,348
I know you and Shane talk all
the time, but, you know, it's...

12
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,150
You actually haven't seen
this boy in almost a year.

13
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,152
I just don't want you to be
too disappointed, honey,

14
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:53,887
if he can't come
to camp this summer.

15
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,523
Mom.

16
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,658
I want you to have fun
and focus on your music.

17
00:00:57,726 --> 00:01:00,595
Okay, first off, this is goanna
be the best summer ever.

18
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,897
And second, nothing can make me
lose my focus.

19
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:07,034
What is that?
Did somebody open another camp?

20
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:10,304
{ominous theme playing}

21

{uplifting theme playing}

22
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:23,917
Seriously,
why would somebody open up

23
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:25,519
another camp across the lake?

24
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:28,822
Oh, who knows, but I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,059
Aah! Caitlyn!
Oh! Mitchie!

26

27
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,598
Hi! Aah!
Caitlyn!

28
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,533
How are you?
I'm great.

29
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,369
Let me take this for you.
Thank you.

30
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,871
I was so afraid that we weren't
goanna get here in time,

31
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,273
but doesn't look like
many are here.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,807
Well, you know what this means.

33
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,677
Since we're the first ones here,
we totally get our choice of--

34
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,248
Bunk.

35
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:56,484

I bet you sounded
fantastic.

38
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:04,224
Yeah? Oh, my gosh.

39
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:08,896
Well, I guess no one cares
about my life.

40
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,165
What don't we know? I mean,
you update your status,

41
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,300
like, every two seconds.

42
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:15,436
Fine.

43
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:18,506
I have a question,
and it's for Mitchie.

44
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,341
For me?

45
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,177
So, what's going on
with you and Shane? Hm?

46
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,378
{all giggle}

47
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:26,980
Nothing is going on.
That's a total lie.

48
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:29,483
You guys are obsessed.
{all laugh}

49
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,252
No, seriously.
I don't know, I just...

50
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,522
I feel like if we never get
to spend any time together,

51
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:37,124
then nothing
is ever goanna happen.

52
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,193

56
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,204
That's good.

57
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,373
Can we please just wait
for the tow truck?

58
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,274
Oliver tried
and he couldn't get it.

59
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:55,810
Mm-hm.

60
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,812
That's because Oliver's
not properly motivated.

61
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,814
He's not trying to get
to Camp Rock before Mitchie.

62
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:02,015
We should have never taken
that shortcut.

63
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,585
Maybe because Oliver
doesn't even know Mitchie.

64
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,758
Thanks.

65
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,861
It's goanna be really cool.
I got it all planned.

66
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:17,931
She'll walk in, and I'll be
sitting there, and I'll say:

67
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,633
"Hey, Mitchie."

68
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,135
She's goanna be
so surprised.

69
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,438
"Hey, Mitchie"?
That's your big line?

70
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:27,007
Trust me.
Everything's cool when I do it.

71
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:30,411
I'm just excited to finally
spend some time with her.

72
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:34,749
Oh, here you go.
Is this from the tire?

73
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:36,183
Yeah. I saw it
on the ground before.

74
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,151
Thought it was important,
so I put it in my pocket.

75
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,653
Why didn't you
tell me this earlier?

76
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:42,823
How could I have told you
if I didn't remember until now?

77
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,492
It's fine.
Just one bolt, right?

78
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,059
We good?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.

Please.
No!

82
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:54,402
Oh! Please, don't.
No, no, no.

83
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:55,569
No!

84
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,908
No!
Oh!

85
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:03,711
No, no, no!
Oh!

86
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,056
Told you
it was important.

Where is everybody?

00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,077
I know, right? There's, like,
barely anybody out there.

90
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,047
I sure hope you've got something
we can do at opening jam.

91
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,616
Because if not,
I've got nothing.

92
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:46,454
Kind of, maybe, sort of.
I don't know. I--

93
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:48,388
Can we hear it?
Sing it.

94
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:50,658
Uh, okay.

00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,657
¶¶ Got the spirit ¶¶
¶¶ It's a brand-new day ¶¶

171
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:46,293
¶¶ It's a brand-new day ¶¶

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,529
¶¶ It's a brand-new day ¶¶

173
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:52,399
¶¶ And I'm feeling' good ¶¶

174
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:56,369
¶¶ Feeling' good
And I'm feeling' good ¶¶

175
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,173
{all cheering}

176
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,042
Yeah! Whoo!
Yeah!

177
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,045
Yes, all right.

178
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:09,382
Mitchie Torres,
returning rocker. Yes!

179
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,354
Welcome to the heart and soul
of rock 'n' roll.

180
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:17,091
Whether you're slick and
happening or dark and jamming,

181
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:20,427
Camp Rock is the place to be,
yeah?

182
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,129
All right!
{all cheering}

183
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,532
Now, I'm sure you've noticed

184
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,936
that there aren't quite as many
of you as in years past.

185
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:31,188
But not to worry.
{horn honking}

186
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:32,555
{squeals}
Ooh.

187
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,756
Shane!

188
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,525
Sorry, she does that.

189
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:38,761
BROWN:
Rockers, my nephews,
and Camp Rock alum,

190
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,564
better known to the world
as Connect Three!

191
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:42,932
Hey.

192
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:44,101
{grunts}

193
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:45,535
{crowd gasps}

194
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,670
We probably shouldn't have
tied his shoes together.

195
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:50,040
He's the one who said he could
make anything look cool.

196
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,975
{squawks}

197
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:55,045
And I believe
he stands corrected.

198
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:57,914
Shane.
Are you all right?

199
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:00,150
Yeah, I'm fine.
{chuckles}

200
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:01,351
Surprise.

201
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,253
{chuckles}

202
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:05,055
All right.

203
00:10:05,123 --> 00:10:08,458
They are goanna be with us
for the entire summer.

204
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,060
The whole summer?

205
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,595
Absolutely.
{chuckles}

206
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:16,366
The official reason being
they miss their uncle.

207
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,868
But I don't think
that's the entire story.

208
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,405
CROWD:
Ooh!

209
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:22,705
People are staring.

210
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,842
You might wanna do something,
like react or wave.

211
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,378
Hey, guys. I'm Shane.
This is Jason and Nate.

212
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,947
{crowd cheers}

213
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,615
We know it's goanna be hard,

214
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:35,352
but just treat us
like normal campers.

215
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:39,222
Wow, I guess it's not
goanna be that hard.

216
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,957
BROWN:
Yeah, as I was saying,

217
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,959
um, we're a little
smaller this year,

218
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:46,563
and that is courtesy of our
new friends across the lake,

219
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,997
Camp Star,

220
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:52,402
founded, not so coincidentally,
by my out-to-destroy-me,

221
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,672
still-mad-that-I-kicked-him
out-of-the-group

222
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,175
former bandmate,
Axel Turner.

223
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,776
Axel Turner?

224
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,845
The guy who owns Star Records?
He's across the lake?

225
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:07,016
Yes, and I share your disdain,
Tess. Thank you for that.

226
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,553
Now, it's goanna take
some effort,

227
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,154
but I'm sure we can all

228
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:14,724
peacefully co-exist on the lake,
yeah?

229
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,793
{dramatic theme playing}

230
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,235
We're under attack!

231
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:36,646
BOY:
Nice.

232
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,120
It's full of marshmallows.

233
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,489
This one has chocolate.
Whoa.

234
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:47,890
Graham crackers.

235
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:54,531
Camp Rock's invited
to an opening-night bonfire.

236
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:57,501
{all cheering}
No, no, no. Absolutely not. No.

237
00:11:57,568 --> 00:12:00,537
ALL {chanting}:
Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire!

238
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:04,874
This is a setup.
For what I'm not sure.

239
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,043
Come on, Brown. It'll be fun.

240
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:09,579
You said yourself
we all need to get along, right?

241
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:12,215
And it's not just because
I haven't made dessert yet.

242
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:15,652
This is really good chocolate.
Isn't it?

243
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,720
{upbeat theme playing}

244
00:12:22,193 --> 00:12:23,926
TESS:
One word: wow.

245
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,396
This isn't a camp,
i-it's a resort.

246
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,898
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

247
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:32,135
All right, I got it.

248
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:35,338
Oh, I don't got it.

249
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,807
I think we should add this
to the uncool list.

250
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,910
A little help--
A little help, please.

251
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,279
Thank you. Ah.

252
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:43,846
See,
these are the type of things

253
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,649
that you can't learn
over e-mail.

254
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,684
Maybe we should
go back to that.

255
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:52,088
Guys, I'm not kidding.
Line up and wait for me.

256
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,057
Junior rockers, I'm serious.

257
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:56,059
Please wait.

258
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,360
Hey, what's up, guys?

259
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,363
I remember when I used to be
a junior rocker.

260
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:03,533
I-Is that a camera, bud?
Don't touch it.

261
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,269
What, you think I'm goanna drop
it in the water?

262
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:11,308
And if you thought that,
I guess you'd be right.

263
00:13:13,311 --> 00:13:15,645
You dropped it, Curly.
You swim for it.

264
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:16,813
Yeah. Um...

265
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,149
Brown, my man. Long time.

266
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:23,286
Hi, I'm Connie.
Hi.

267
00:13:23,354 --> 00:13:26,623
Listen, Axel, I don't actually
know what your plan is--

268
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:27,824
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

269
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,326
A breath and a step.

270
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,294
I'm beginning to remember
why I left the band.

271
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:34,397
Left the band.
You l-- You left the band?

272
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,267
That is so rich. Is that what
you're telling people?

273
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,637
You, my friend, have got to stop
living in the past.

274
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:42,439
I'm trying to reach out
to you here.

275
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:47,110
Reach out? Reach out by driving
me out of business. I love it.

276
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:49,946
There's no reason why we both
can't be successful.

277
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,949
We both have our niche.
Niche?

278
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,084
Camp Star is dedicated
to producing

279
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:56,853
the superstars of tomorrow.

280
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,055
And, uh, what's your place
about again?

281
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:02,792
Encouraging kids
in their love of music, Axel.

282
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,961
Ah.

283
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:07,830
Like I said,
room for both of us.

284
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,303
Y-You know,
just to be clear,

285
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,205
he did not leave the band.
We kicked him out.

286
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:19,376
I know, I know.
It's okay.

287
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:22,011
We kicked him out.

288
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,148
SHANE:
Question: What do you say
you and I break away later

289
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,651
and I finally take you
on a first date?

290
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,487
Answer:
I'd like that.

291
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,125
MAN:
Check, check. One, two.
Check, check.

292
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:38,628
One, two. Check, check, check.

293
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,397
Wow.

294
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,898
I know, right?

295
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,034
That's all I've been saying
since I got off the boat.

296
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,541
Come on.

297
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,948
Ready?
We really shouldn't be here.

298
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:01,984
It's so obvious this guy's just
doing this to get back at Brown.

299
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,220
First, he tries to take down
the White Crows,

300
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,255
and now Camp Rock.

301
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:07,924
What is that?

302
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,627
Hot chocolate. They're handing
it out free when you walk in,

303
00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:12,796
plus you get to keep the mug.

304
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,032
What?

305
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:18,901
There's no way I'm staying
at this bonfire.

306
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,871
Hey, pouty boy.
You better hurry.

307
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:23,139
The bonfire's
about to start.

308
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:28,578
You know, we should probably
go take our seats.

309
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:30,447
I think they're about to start.

310
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,848
Mm-hm.

311
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:34,016
Don't mock.
I'm not.

312
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:36,319
Yes, you are.
Okay, just a little bit.

313
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:39,422
Ah.

314
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,091
Look, they actually have
a real Wardrobe department

315
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,361
with incredible fabric.
And they let me make this.

316
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:48,365
Uh-oh. I think I just sewed
my scarf to my bra.

317
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,334
So I thought this was supposed
to be a campfire.

318
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:55,772
You know, singing,
telling stories, an actual fire.

319
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,407
Everybody have a seat.

320
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,275
{crowd cheering}

321
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,277
I'm Axel Turner.

322
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,315
And I'd like to welcome
all you rockers,

323
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,853
and my dear, old friend,
Brown Cesario--

324
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:12,589
Yeah, Brown! Whoo!

325
00:16:12,656 --> 00:16:14,557
--to Camp Star!

326
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,826
{dramatic music playing}

327
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,895
Go, Brown!

328
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,066
But you all don't wanna hear
a speech from me.

329
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:28,605
You wanna get to what a campfire
is really all about:

330
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,407
singing.

331
00:16:30,474 --> 00:16:34,076
Hey, that's what you just said.
You're twins. Ha-ha-ha!

332
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:38,615
So does anyone have anything
they'd like to play?

333
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:41,818
Camp Rockers, don't be shy.

334
00:16:41,886 --> 00:16:44,353
{crowd chattering}

335
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,957
Well, we'll go,
if nobody else wants to.

336
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:49,826
{crowd cheering}

337
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:05,007
This song is about me
and a friend of mine.

338
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:10,079
{playing soft acoustic music}

339
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:22,959
¶¶ We're like a melody
With no words ¶¶

340
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:25,695
¶¶ Until we figure it out ¶¶

341
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:31,133
¶¶ We sing
"La, la, la, la, la, la" ¶¶

342
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:35,204
¶¶ I know it's simple, yeah
But it's worked ¶¶

343
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,842
¶¶ Right up till now ¶¶

344
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:42,512
¶¶ 'Cause up till now, yeah ¶¶

345
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,884
¶¶ Every day's been like
A dream world ¶¶

346
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:52,922
¶¶ Oh, but now you're not
Just in my head ¶¶

347
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,757
¶¶ Oh, no ¶¶

348
00:17:54,825 --> 00:18:00,730
¶¶ Will we remember
Different summers? ¶¶

349
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,265
¶¶ It's like tossing your heart ¶¶

350
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,836
¶¶ To see where it lands ¶¶

351
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:10,339
¶¶ Heads is easy ¶¶

352
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:15,645
¶¶ Tails is harder to plan ¶¶

353
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:20,082
¶¶ If we're starting
All over again ¶¶

354
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,453
¶¶ And again and again ¶¶

355
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:29,526
¶¶ Oh, you know that I can't help
But wonder ¶¶

356
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,294
¶¶ What's goanna happen next ¶¶

357
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,532
¶¶ I'm a little curious ¶¶

358
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,300
¶¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶

359
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,804
¶¶ Every star
That I stood under ¶¶

360
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:44,507
¶¶ When you were under it too ¶¶

361
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:47,510
¶¶ Did you ever think about us? ¶¶

362
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:55,618
¶¶ I hope you did
'Cause I can tell you ¶¶

363
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:59,822
¶¶ That's something
I'll never forget ¶¶

364
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,558
¶¶ I won't forget ¶¶

365
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:07,496
¶¶ If we remember
Different summers ¶¶

366
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:10,232

¶¶ Only friends ¶¶

372
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:35,257
¶¶ Just beginning ¶¶

373
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:40,329
¶¶ But I hope
That we find it again ¶¶

374
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:45,835
¶¶ So we can
Go from here ¶¶

375
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:50,139
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

376
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:56,112

00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:57,106
That was sweet.

389
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,543
But I guess it's time
for Camp Star to answer.

390
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,214
And, heh, my apologies
if we embarrass ourselves.

391
00:21:04,281 --> 00:21:07,116

Ow! Oh.

440
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,434
Nate, are you okay?

{crowd cheering}

442
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:44,374

You guys rock!

{all cheering}

444
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,678
And that's how we do things here

445
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:52,882
at Camp Star!

446
00:23:52,949 --> 00:23:55,051
Wow.

447
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:57,120
{Axel chuckling}

448
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,757
Uh, before we go any further,

449
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:03,893
I'd like to make a quick
announcement.

450
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,963
We're having staffing problems.
Who knew we'd be so popular?

451
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:10,133
All right,
now we're under attack.

452
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,268
So I'd just like
to put it out there.

453
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:15,704
If there are any Camp Rock
counsellors or staff

454
00:24:15,772 --> 00:24:18,141
who'd like to make the switch,

455
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,943
I'd be more than willing
to double your salary.

456
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:24,147
You've gotta be joking. I barely
have enough staff as it is.

457
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,649
I'll go.
What?

458
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,052
No.

459
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,588
And, if there are any Camp Rock
campers who'd like to join us,

460
00:24:32,656 --> 00:24:34,823
well, I'm sure we can
find you a bunk.

461
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:39,128
Oh, did I mention
our cabins are air-conditioned?

462
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,729
He can't do this.

463
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:42,665
Right.
I need all the Camp Rockers

464
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,800
back on the boats now. Come on.

465
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:46,035
Go, please.

466
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,336
Come on, guys.
Back to the boats.

467
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:50,606
Let's go. Come on.

468
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:02,051
Are you sure it's okay?

469
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,419
Not a scratch.

470
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,421
I'm really sorry
about that.

471
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:08,257
Oh, it's all good.
I'm totally fine.

472
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:10,293
I'm just happy
I could catch it for you.

473
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,695
Well, it's always
kind of been my lucky charm.

474
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:15,931
I guess it still works.

475
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,801
Did you forget the part
where you hit him in the eye?

476
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:25,074
I'll be over there.

477
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:29,545
So, Dana,
you were amazing up there.

478
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:32,014
You think?
I'm just glad it's finally over.

479
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:33,949
We've been practicing for weeks,

480
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,551
and still,
every time I go on,

481
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,886
I'm almost sure
I'm goanna throw up.

482
00:25:39,223 --> 00:25:40,689
I'm really glad you guys came.

483
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:43,792
My dad was totally sure
none of you would show.

484
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,129
My dad's Axel Turner.

485
00:25:46,196 --> 00:25:48,731
He's your dad?
{mouthing words}

486
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,101
Heh. Everybody says that,
and kind of exactly like that,

487
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:53,736
but trust me,
once you get to know him,

488
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,239
he's a really great guy.

489
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,142
Well, I-I guess I should go.

490
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:02,211
Here.
You don't wanna lose it.

491
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,647
You can keep it if you want.

492
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:07,916
What would I do with a bracelet?
Right.

493
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,820
For the record,
I'm glad you're okay.

494
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,389
You have really pretty eyes.

495
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:17,760
Ah. Sorry, that was weird.

496
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,395
I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable.

497
00:26:19,463 --> 00:26:22,765
No, it's all good. People tell
me that all the time.

498
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,267
Um, probably because
they're right

499
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:26,435
in the middle of my face, so...
Uh-huh.

500
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,275
So... Heh. What--?

501
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:33,942
Um...

502
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,580
I'll see you around.
Okay.

503
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:43,219
Yes, I wanna keep it, you have
pretty eyes too. Stupid.

504
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:49,058
I'm an idiot.
Ha.

505
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,394
Something we both
can agree on.

506
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:55,097
Ow. Strong idiot.

507
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,168
I...

508
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:02,205
I don't want you
talking to that boy.

509
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,908
Don't worry, I don't think
it's goanna be a problem.

510
00:27:07,344 --> 00:27:09,478
Okay, come on.

511
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,649
Rockers, boats now.

512
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:17,086
{scoffs}

513
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,521
Wow.

514
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:22,324
Now, this is a recording studio.

515
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:25,394
Hey.
Um...

516
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:27,696
Hi.

517
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:29,331
Can I help you with something?

518
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,500
Do I look like I need help?

519
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,936
Heh. Do I know you?

520
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:36,805
That's funny. I'm Luke.

521
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,607
Luke Williams.

522
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:41,643
I was just on-stage,
like two minutes ago.

523
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:45,281
¶¶ I'm giving you the fire ¶¶

524
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:47,616
{vocalizing}

525
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,121
Wow, impressive.

526
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,190
I know, right?
It's kind of my thing.

527
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,092
So you thinking about
joining us over here?

528
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,261
Uh, no, I'm perfectly happy
where I am.

529
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,398
Well, you are Shane Gray's
girlfriend, so...

530
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:05,468
Wait, what does Shane--?
How do you even know that?

531
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:06,635
You have to know the players

532
00:28:06,703 --> 00:28:08,036
if you wanna be in the game,
right?

533
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,439
No.
It's a tough business.

534
00:28:10,507 --> 00:28:12,308
It's summer camp.

535
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,376
To you, but to anybody
at Camp Star,

536
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,045
it's step one to a long
and illustrious career.

537
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,047
I don't have time
for second rate.

538
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:21,117
We're not second rate.

539
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:22,951
You don't have to get
all defensive.

540
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,186
It's none of my business,

541
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:25,621
you don't have to try
to convince me.

542
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:27,723
I'm not trying
to do anything.

543
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,692
Good. You're at the perfect
place for you.

544
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,462
Look, just so we're clear,

545
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,731
Luke "I'm giving you the fire"
Williams,

546
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,066
or whatever your name is,

547
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,536
not one Camp Rocker,
not in a million years,

548
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,471
would ever even think
about coming over

549
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:46,475
to this narcissistic,
over-produced ego factory.

550
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:49,645
Guess what? My mom said yes.
I get to make the switch.

551
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:52,748
That's great.
Welcome to the ego factory.

552
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:54,550
Thanks.

553
00:28:54,618 --> 00:28:56,352
Tess, how could you?

554
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,489
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I feel horrible, but...

555
00:29:00,557 --> 00:29:01,990
{laughing}

556
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:03,526
Who am I kidding?
I am so excited,

557
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:06,195
I can't even pretend
to be sympathetic.

558
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,264
That was great
what you did up there.

559
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,400
¶¶ I'm giving you the fire ¶¶

560
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:12,901
So impressive.

561
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:14,270
I know, right?

562
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,305
Wow.

563
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:17,906
Good luck trying to find
a spotlight

564
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:19,441
big enough
for the both of you.

565
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:20,942
{scoffs}

566
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:25,747
{birds chirping}

567
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,816
{soft theme playing}

568
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,820
{all chattering}

569
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:34,156
No, you guys,
it's goanna be okay.

570
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:36,892
I mean, Brown's a smart guy,
he can figure something out.

571
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:40,596
Thanks for that vote
of confidence, Mitchie.

572
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:43,632
Guess I don't have to get
everyone's attention.

573
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,235
So the good news is,

574
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:49,137
and this really warms my heart,

575
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,240
we lost very few campers
last night.

576
00:29:51,308 --> 00:29:54,310
{crowd cheers}

577
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,612
That's right.

578
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,716
But we did lose quite a few
of our remaining staff.

579
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:02,184
Which means,

580
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:05,654
and I can't believe
I have to say this,

581
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,424
Camp Rock is closed,
effective immediately.

582
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:10,092
GIRL: Wait, what?
BOY: No.

583
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,528
Y-You have to believe me,
I-I truly--

584
00:30:12,596 --> 00:30:14,896
I've got no other option.

585
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:18,033
I'll start calling parents
as soon as we're done here,

586
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,068
which I guess is now.

587
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:22,338
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:26,074
Brown, wait. Guys.

589
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:28,677
Camp is over?
But we just got here.

590
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:29,878
It's not his fault.

591
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:32,248
I mean, there's nothing
he can do about it.

592
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:34,182
GIRL:
Man, this is such a bummer.

593
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,152
But...

594
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,755
that doesn't mean there isn't
something we can do about it.

595
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:41,089
Mitchie.

596
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,625
No, I'm serious.

597
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:45,927
This is our summer,
and we're not giving up.

598
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:48,530
We're not backing down.
GIRL: Right.

599
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,098
I don't know, Mitchie.

600
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:54,270

BROWN:
What's going on?

659
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:18,207
Well, you said you needed
some new counsellors, so...

660
00:34:18,275 --> 00:34:20,042
I found you some.

661
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:27,416
Then it looks like I should call
this staff meeting to order.

662
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:30,286
Yes.
Thank you.

663
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,653
BOY: Yes.
GIRL: All right.

664
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:33,588
GIRL:
Come on, Terry.

665
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:36,625
No, nada. Guys,
I already told you,

666
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:37,893
I'm not goanna be doing this.

667
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:41,330
Jason, you're looking
at this all wrong.

668
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:43,866
This isn't punishment.

669
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,767
It's a reward.

670
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,169
Really?
Really.

671
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:48,770
This just means
that everybody thinks

672
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:50,272
that you have
the leadership skills,

673
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,908
the maturity,
the intelligence--

674
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:55,177
You think I'm intelligent?
No.

675
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:57,279
--and the sheer guts
to take on this challenge.

676
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,849
Wow, you're good.
Thank you.

677
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:03,919
You're right.
This is an honour.

678
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:07,122
Exactly. Now, get in there
and make us proud.

679
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:09,959
We'll be right here
if you need us.

680
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:12,027
{children squealing}

681
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,097
All right.

682
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,167
Run.
Run.

683
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:20,802
Hi, everybody. I'm Jason.

684
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,105
I'm goanna be your counsellor.

685
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:24,874
I'm a little new at this
so I thought you guys

686
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:26,475
would go a little bit
easier on me.

687
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,743
What do you say?

688
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,045
I say, let's get him.

689
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:32,481
ALL: Yeah!
Guys, guys, hold on a minute.

690
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:37,819
Now get him.

691
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,654
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

692
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,258
{all yelling}

693
00:35:42,325 --> 00:35:43,926
{upbeat pop music playing}

694
00:35:47,197 --> 00:35:49,965
All right, let's dance.

695
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,267
Sorry.

696
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,410
{children clamouring}

697
00:36:20,897 --> 00:36:22,497
All good?
ALL: All good.

698
00:36:22,565 --> 00:36:24,333
Let's do this.

699
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:31,373
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

700
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,943
Here we go, guys. All right.

701
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,313
Circle, down.
Head, meet, out.

702
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,319
Louder.

703
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:45,988
{all singing scales}
Awesome.

704
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:47,990
Got a colour that looks good
with his eye colour.

705
00:36:48,058 --> 00:36:49,858
What about this, girls? Right?

706
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:54,163
Hi.

707
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,350
{children squealing}
{groans}

708
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:15,717
Enough.

709
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:18,053
Do you wanna rock?

710
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:20,089
Well, you know what?
You don't deserve to rock.

711
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:22,724
Why should I show you the first
thing about being a rock star,

712
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,394
if you don't wanna show me
any respect?

713
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:30,366
Well, okay, then.

714
00:37:30,433 --> 00:37:32,034
Who wants to play the drums?

715
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:36,305
Who wants to play the guitar?

716
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,475
Who wants to be a lead singer?

717
00:37:40,977 --> 00:37:42,911
Well, you are goanna
have to buy tighter pants

718
00:37:42,979 --> 00:37:44,779
and learn how to play
a tambourine.

719
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,716
I heard that.
JASON: Sorry.

720
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:50,352
{whispers}:
It's true.

721
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,853
{piano playing in distance}

722
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:53,955
{ducks quacking}

723
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:01,063
Nate?
Yeah.

724
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:04,433
Shane. What's up, bro?

725
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:06,068
What are you doing?

726
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:09,071
Um, lifeguard duty.

727
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:11,407
Schedule's a mess,
but you can't be too careful.

728
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:15,177
Just one last look.

729
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,582
All clear.

730
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:27,956
So, what do I have to do to pull
you away from this clipboard?

731
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:30,692
Mitchie,
I just rolled 100 pounds

732
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,727
of raw hamburger all by myself.

733
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,963
I told you, honey,
I needed help.

734
00:38:35,031 --> 00:38:36,498
No, no, no, that--
That's impossible.

735
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:37,899
I know for a fact
that I scheduled--

736
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,736
Absolutely nobody. I'm so sorry.
What's going on?

737
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:44,506
This isn't working.
The kitchen is a disaster.

738
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:47,076
Yesterday, I ordered 50 pounds
of black beans

739
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:50,946
and they delivered
50 cases of beach balls instead.

740
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:54,483
Well, you gotta admit, Mom,

741
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,951
you don't have the best
handwriting.

742
00:38:56,018 --> 00:38:58,353
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, it's rock 'n' roll, right?

743
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,122
It's goanna be
a little chaotic.

744
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,790
I think you're doing great.
We'll just make

745
00:39:01,857 --> 00:39:04,025
some adjustments
to the schedule, yeah?

746
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,995
Perfect. Shane,
help Connie with the hamburgers.

747
00:39:07,063 --> 00:39:09,198
Actually, I've--
I've got this thing--

748
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,032
Oh, really?
Well, come on, pretty boy.

749
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,501
No, but--

750
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,703
{laughing}

751
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,271
{playing steady beat}

752
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,641
All right, that's it.
Now pick it up.

753
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,777
Bring it home.

754
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:27,349
I knew you could do it.

755
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,218
All right, now it's, uh,
getting a little late,

756
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,052
so what do you say
we all go enjoy some free time?

757
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,387
ALL: Yeah.
BOY: All right.

758
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,823
{soft theme playing}

759
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,544
Hey, man.
Oh.

760
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:57,579
What are you doing?

761
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,581
Why does everybody
keep doing that?

762
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:03,084
Sorry, we're just doing our part
as activity directors.

763
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:05,887
And what's the activity today?

764
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,256
Wakeboarding.

765
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,923
{laughing}

766
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:11,059
No!

767
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:13,428
Oh!

768
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,499
{soft theme playing}

769
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,635
{grunts}

770
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:24,072
Are you okay?

771
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,074
Yeah, I'm great.

772
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,709
{sighs}

773
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:30,245
Uh, don't suppose
you came over here

774
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:31,513
to see anyone
in particular.

775
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:34,115
No,
just getting some exercise.

776
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:36,718
Do you play a lot of sports?

777
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:40,689
Canoeing.
That's pretty much it.

778
00:40:40,756 --> 00:40:42,257
I'm really
not all that sporty either.

779
00:40:42,325 --> 00:40:44,959
I played soccer when I was
little, but who doesn't?

780
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,196
I don't know if it counts
as a sport,

781
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:49,298
but I'd kind of love
to be a dancer.

782
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,600
It's like my nerdy secret,
"if I could be anything,

783
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:54,969
that's what I'd be" wish.
What would you be?

784
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:57,072
I don't know.
Never thought about it.

785
00:40:57,139 --> 00:40:59,608
Probably because if you could
be anything, you'd be you.

786
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:01,176
{both chuckling}

787
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:05,414
Uh, do you wanna hear something
really stupid?

788
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:06,781
I was goofing around,

789
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,386
and I accidentally sort of
wrote your name on my hand

790
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:14,823
but used permanent ink
by mistake.

791
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,326
No one's ever written my name
on their hand before.

792
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:20,295
Really more my wrist.
Heh.

793
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:22,431
Dana--
Yeah?

794
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:23,832
AXEL:
Dana?

795
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,400
Oh, it's my dad.

796
00:41:25,468 --> 00:41:28,136
I'm so sorry, I'm not supposed
to be talking to you.

797
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:30,071
Hurry. Go.

798
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,773
AXEL:
Dana?

799
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:35,510
Dana.
Hey.

800
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,479
I saw this canoe.

801
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:40,549
Ugh. Don't touch it,
it's one of theirs.

802
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:43,051
I'll have an attendant
fish it out.

803
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,954
What's that on your wrist?
Nothing.

804
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,359
You wanna know what I wanna be?

805
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:53,295
The kind of guy who can tell you
how he really feels.

806
00:41:53,363 --> 00:41:55,864
I hate canoes.

807
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,932
{upbeat theme playing}

808
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:04,873
I'm still an idiot.
I still agree.

809
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,708
Dude,
you can't keep hitting me.

810
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,577
Thank you.
{footsteps approaching}

811
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,078
Oh!
{Mitchie giggling}

812
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:11,680
SHANE:
Ow.

813
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:12,981
Thanks, Mitchie.

814
00:42:13,048 --> 00:42:15,284
I had absolutely
the best day ever.

815
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:17,085
Everything's finally
starting to work out.

816
00:42:17,153 --> 00:42:19,187
That's great.
It's all because of you.

817
00:42:19,255 --> 00:42:21,055
No, it's because of us.

818
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,891
Now that everybody else
has gotten your time,

819
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,526
I think I'm goanna demand
some of my own.

820
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:27,396
It hasn't been that bad.

821
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,499
The whole reason I'm here,
the reason my brothers are here,

822
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:33,001
is so I can
get to know you better.

823
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:35,970
It's only been like two seconds.

824
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:37,839
And that is
the sweetest thing

825
00:42:37,907 --> 00:42:39,741
that anybody has ever
said to me.

826
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,242
But...
But--

827
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,544
BARRON {over PA}:
Now a word from

828
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:44,145
your friendly
neighbourhood announcer.

829
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:46,080
Will the counsellors
scheduled for the bonfire

830
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:47,683
please report to the mess hall.

831
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,252
But you gotta go.
But we gotta go.

832
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,390
Are you coming?

833
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,526
No, it's cool. I'll catch up.

834
00:42:57,593 --> 00:42:58,927
Shane.

835
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:01,095
Go, they need you.

836
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,565
Okay.

837
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,278
{guitar playing soft music}

838
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:20,615
Hey. I'm impressed.
Ehh.

839
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,918
You seem to be doing
much better with them.

840
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:24,186
It took
a little bit of time,

841
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,421
but I think I finally gained
their respect.

842
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,925
{whispering indistinctly}

843
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:31,459
{laughing}

844
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,065
Who glued me to this log?

845
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,633
{all laughing}

846
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:40,235
{singsong}:
Log Butt, Log Butt.

847
00:43:40,302 --> 00:43:42,137
We're goanna call you Log Butt.

848
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,572
You know what's worse
than being called Log Butt?

849
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,942
Is being sat on by Log Butt.

850
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:48,777
Oh! Ooh!

851
00:43:48,845 --> 00:43:51,579
BROWN:
Run. Run, he's got you.

852
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:52,814
Come back here.

853
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:56,118
Fireflies.

854
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:58,519
I'm goanna get this one.
Okay, catch them, everybody.

855
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:00,455
Let's jump. Jump.

856
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:02,457
{chuckling}

857
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:06,594
{suspenseful theme playing}

858
00:44:06,662 --> 00:44:09,831
Looks like the Lord of the Flies
over there.

859
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:13,135
There's no way they're goanna
make it through the summer.

860
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:18,774
I remember doing that.
It's fun.

861
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:21,109
Don't even think about it.

862
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:28,516
{sighs}

863
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,789
It felt so great just standing
up in front of that class today.

864
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:36,357
I feel like there's
nothing we can't do.

865
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,694
Pleats.
Still can't do pleats.

866
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:43,198
Wish we had that attitude
the other night at Camp Star.

867
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,333
Yeah, I so wanted
to show them up.

868
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:47,836
That hardly counted. They'd been
planning that for weeks.

869
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:49,570
Yeah, and now they're all
walking around

870
00:44:49,638 --> 00:44:50,939
thinking they're better than us.

871
00:44:51,007 --> 00:44:52,473
PEGGY:
So not true.

872
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,443
You know, I'd really like to see
them go up against us.

873
00:44:55,511 --> 00:44:56,678
BARRON:
Yeah.

874
00:44:56,745 --> 00:44:58,346
CAITLYN:
If we had time
to get it together,

875
00:44:58,414 --> 00:44:59,647
no way they'd stand a chance.

876
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:01,183
Like in Final Jam.

877
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,018
There's just no way.

878
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:06,822
Lot of big talk.
Wanna see if it's true?

879
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:12,194
{mellow theme playing}

880
00:45:14,897 --> 00:45:16,998
It's about time.

881
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:19,968
My private vocal lessons
started ten minutes ago.

882
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:21,970
Oh, I'm sorry.

883
00:45:22,038 --> 00:45:26,607
I forgot that Axel thinks
you need the extra rehearsal.

884
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:29,311
ALL {chanting}:
Camp Rock.

885
00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:32,714
Camp Rock.

886
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:36,484
Camp Rock.

887
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:40,121
Camp Rock.

888
00:45:41,924 --> 00:45:43,091
Camp Rock.

889
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:48,730
Camp Rock.

890
00:45:48,797 --> 00:45:51,766
Camp Rock. Ooh.

891
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:55,670
Yeah, that's right.
We're here on your stage.

892
00:45:55,738 --> 00:45:57,405
See, you guys didn't really
give us a chance

893
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:58,940
to answer back
the other night.

894
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,609
But guess what?
That's goanna change.

895
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:04,812
Camp Rock vs. Camp Star,
the Final Jam.

896
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,581
What do you guys think
about that?

897
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:09,417
Drums.

898
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:12,553
{playing steady beat}

899
00:46:12,621 --> 00:46:13,788
A little guitar, please.

900
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:15,656
{playing upbeat music}

901
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:17,025

00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:19,214
¶¶ There, there, there, there

¶¶ That crew can't hang with us
Man, we're too dangerous ¶¶

954
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:28,356

00:48:28,424 --> 00:48:31,526

992
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,225
{crowd cheering}

993
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,098
That is a fantastic idea.

994
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:20,335
Truly. I'm impressed.

995
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:23,371
A little healthy competition
is exactly what we need.

996
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:27,342
A champion always needs
a good sparring partner.

997
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:28,676
We do?

998
00:50:28,744 --> 00:50:30,678
But you really think
that you can,

999
00:50:30,746 --> 00:50:34,349
uh, take my guys on
head-to-head?

1000
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,916
{scoffs}

1001
00:50:35,984 --> 00:50:38,186
Anytime, anyplace.
GIRL: Yup.

1002
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:39,854
BOY: Yeah.
Can't wait.

1003
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:42,056
Maybe use our amphitheatre.

1004
00:50:42,124 --> 00:50:43,458
Doesn't matter where.

1005
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:45,860
We just know that Camp Rock
is goanna blow you guys away.

1006
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:48,029
GIRL: That's right.
BOY: Straight up.

1007
00:50:48,096 --> 00:50:50,532
I'm sure an audience
would be a better judge of that.

1008
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:53,901
Bring it on. You can pack it
with anybody you want.

1009
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:56,404
{chuckles}

1010
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:58,939
Well,
how about a worldwide audience?

1011
00:51:00,108 --> 00:51:03,411
What if we put this little
competition on TV?

1012
00:51:03,479 --> 00:51:05,813
Have the public decide
who's really the best.

1013
00:51:05,881 --> 00:51:08,550
TV? We'd really get to be on TV?

1014
00:51:08,617 --> 00:51:11,085
Uh, I don't really know
about this.

1015
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:12,887
Not such a big talker now,
are you?

1016
00:51:12,954 --> 00:51:14,522
{Camp Star chuckles}

1017
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,692
But that would be so cool.
The whole world would see us.

1018
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,727
Uh...

1019
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:22,530
SANDER:
Come on, Mitchie.
This could be huge.

1020
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:24,965
BOY:
Yeah, let's do it.

1021
00:51:25,033 --> 00:51:26,501
You're on.

1022
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:27,835
Whoo!
Yeah.

1023
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:30,438
{all cheering}

1024
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,848
I wrote this song
a long time ago

1025
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:41,015
and I kind of
forgot about it,

1026
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,117
but I think it could work.

1027
00:51:44,954 --> 00:51:46,387
It's a duet.

1028
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:48,389
Now. But I think
I could rewrite it

1029
00:51:48,457 --> 00:51:49,724
and make a part for everybody.

1030
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:52,426
Or we can rewrite it.

1031
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:55,796
"I lay pretty, pretty flowers
on your grave."

1032
00:51:56,932 --> 00:51:58,632
Am I the only one who thinks
this song is, like,

1033
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,801
totally depressing?
{clears throat}

1034
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,004
You're on the wrong page.

1035
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:06,107
Yeah, that song
was for my hamster's funeral.

1036
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:07,909
Oh, this is perfect.

1037
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:10,111
The staging
could be pretty cool.

1038
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:12,513
Yeah, it looks like there's some
great spots for dancing.

1039
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:14,115
And it's got a great groove.

1040
00:52:14,183 --> 00:52:15,884
Well, before we get ahead
of ourselves, guys,

1041
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:17,218
I got a couple conditions.

1042
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:18,719
You've got conditions?

1043
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:21,622
Yes. Well, a condition.

1044
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,259
There has to be a spot
for my junior rockers.

1045
00:52:24,326 --> 00:52:28,029
Of course. That's what
this is all about.

1046
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:29,898
So, what do you guys think?

1047
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,933
ALL:
I'm in. Let's do it.

1048
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:34,735
I think somebody should talk
to Uncle Brown.

1049
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:37,638
Why? I already know
what he's goanna say.

1050
00:52:37,706 --> 00:52:40,541
How could she do that?
I told them.

1051
00:52:40,609 --> 00:52:45,113
I told Mitchie Axel Turner
cannot be trusted.

1052
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,815
I don't know why
you're getting so upset.

1053
00:52:47,883 --> 00:52:51,085
At the very least, Camp Rock
could get some great exposure.

1054
00:52:51,153 --> 00:52:53,321
He took advantage
is what he did.

1055
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:55,856
He saw an opportunity
and went for it.

1056
00:52:55,925 --> 00:53:00,261
An opportunity to destroy me
once and for all.

1057
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:02,196
And I thought Mitchie
could be dramatic.

1058
00:53:02,264 --> 00:53:04,632
Okay, then, just call him
and say no.

1059
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:06,968
It's not that big a deal.

1060
00:53:07,036 --> 00:53:08,769
Oh, we're well past
big deal.

1061
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:12,006
Look. "Camp Wars." Catchy.

1062
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:14,508
Yeah, I especially
like the tagline,

1063
00:53:14,576 --> 00:53:16,844
"Only one will survive."

1064
00:53:16,912 --> 00:53:20,281
Millions of viewers will be
watching. That's good, right?

1065
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:23,284
After this,
we are done.

1066
00:53:23,352 --> 00:53:26,354
And not just for the summer,
for good.

1067
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:31,792
Oh, come on. Brown.

1068
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,362
Give them a chance.

1069
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,098
BROWN:
Look, nobody believes
in my rockers more than I do,

1070
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,201
but we are goanna look like
a joke next to Camp Star.

1071
00:53:40,269 --> 00:53:44,538
We don't have the resources,
the infrastructure, the money.

1072
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:46,941
Talent, passion, commitment,
yeah, we've got that.

1073
00:53:47,009 --> 00:53:48,476
It's not goanna matter.

1074
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:50,345
It always matters.

1075
00:53:50,412 --> 00:53:51,912
And when people watch,

1076
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:54,148
where do you think they're goanna
send their kids to camp?

1077
00:53:56,418 --> 00:53:58,152
CONNIE:
She didn't do it on purpose.

1078
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,753
BROWN:
I know.

1079
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:04,058
I just wish she wouldn't have
fallen into the trap.

1080
00:54:06,728 --> 00:54:09,430
{footsteps retreating}

1081
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:19,374
{upbeat theme playing}

1082
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:21,209
SANDER {over PA}:
Good morning, Camp Rock.

1083
00:54:21,276 --> 00:54:23,244
A message from Mitchie Torres:

1084
00:54:23,312 --> 00:54:26,347
All rockers, please report
to the main stage immediately.

1085
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:29,117
Yeah, that means you.
Get moving.

1086
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,389
All right, rockers. There are
new schedules out on the board.

1087
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:35,589
From this moment on,

1088
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:38,026
everything is about winning
the competition.

1089
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:40,361
Everything. We have to be
completely focused.

1090
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:42,296
What about swimming
and waterskiing and--?

1091
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:44,032
Focus. Sorry.
{feedback whining}

1092
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,267
Oh, sorry again.

1093
00:54:46,335 --> 00:54:49,237
Seriously, you guys,
if we wanna save this camp,

1094
00:54:49,304 --> 00:54:51,539
we have to put
all of our energies into this

1095
00:54:51,606 --> 00:54:55,009
and make it the best performance
that any of us have ever put on.

1096
00:54:55,077 --> 00:54:56,310
I mean, we may have
our doubters,

1097
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:57,912
but we have come way too far

1098
00:54:57,979 --> 00:54:59,647
just to back down. Agreed?

1099
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,049
ALL:
Agreed.

1100
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:03,117
All right.
Now, let's go get to work.

1101
00:55:05,054 --> 00:55:07,121
Now.
{feedback whines}

1102
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:09,257
{all chattering}

1103
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:17,598
I don't know what to do
about this set,

1104
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:18,899
but it's just gotta be big.

1105
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,535
Think of the biggest thing
you can imagine

1106
00:55:20,602 --> 00:55:21,635
and then make it bigger.

1107
00:55:21,703 --> 00:55:22,703
All right.
Thanks.

1108
00:55:24,573 --> 00:55:27,075
Mitchie, we're moving
in the wrong direction.

1109
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:29,444
There's even less time on this
than the last one.

1110
00:55:29,511 --> 00:55:32,146
Um, I've got a few minutes now.
That's not what I mean.

1111
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:33,514
Mitchie,
can you look at this?

1112
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:36,150
I want us to coordinate,
but not be all matchy-matchy.

1113
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:37,785
Mitchie-- Hi, Shane.
Hi.

1114
00:55:37,852 --> 00:55:39,187
CAITLYN:
I know you're rewriting,

1115
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:42,022
but we've gotta make some
decisions about the music.

1116
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:43,757
Mitchie, can I talk to you?

1117
00:55:43,825 --> 00:55:45,759
Do you know who's doing
the vocal arrangements?

1118
00:55:45,827 --> 00:55:47,728
If it's me, fine,
but somebody's gotta tell me.

1119
00:55:47,796 --> 00:55:49,597
{sighs}

1120
00:55:49,664 --> 00:55:51,031
I'm sorry.

1121
00:55:55,737 --> 00:55:58,473
{tense theme playing}

1122
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:07,748
{piano playing in distance}

1123
00:56:07,816 --> 00:56:09,984
I don't even know
why I'm here.

1124
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,653
Take my advice
and never get a girlfriend.

1125
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:18,226
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

1126
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,027
{playing soft music}

1127
00:56:22,631 --> 00:56:25,766
{tender theme playing}

1128
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:30,171
{laughing}

1129
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:33,741
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1130
00:56:33,808 --> 00:56:35,510
I thought you were
goanna be rehearsing.

1131
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:39,213
Whoa, calm down. We've been
rehearsing for over five hours.

1132
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,714
We're just taking
a little break.

1133
00:56:40,782 --> 00:56:42,116
Really?
Because I was watching,

1134
00:56:42,184 --> 00:56:45,586
and it looks like we're goanna
need a lot more work.

1135
00:56:45,654 --> 00:56:46,920
{both laughing}

1136
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,324
You guys done already?
No.

1137
00:56:50,392 --> 00:56:51,692
He was telling me
about his sister.

1138
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,594
It's hilarious.
You have to tell her.

1139
00:56:53,662 --> 00:56:55,095
Oh, is it the one
about the group of kids

1140
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:56,597
that didn't take
their jobs seriously

1141
00:56:56,665 --> 00:56:58,032
and then the camp shut down?

1142
00:56:58,099 --> 00:56:59,867
Yeah, I think I've heard it.

1143
00:56:59,934 --> 00:57:01,669
Hey, Mitchie. You gotta check
out this bit

1144
00:57:01,736 --> 00:57:02,870
me and the J.R.'s worked out.

1145
00:57:02,937 --> 00:57:04,705
It's a real spotlight moment.

1146
00:57:04,773 --> 00:57:06,374
That's great.
I'm sure whatever it is,

1147
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:08,643
it's just goanna have to be
more of a background moment.

1148
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,746
Sander, what's going on?

1149
00:57:12,814 --> 00:57:14,682
You guys haven't made
any progress

1150
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:16,016
since I left like
half an hour ago.

1151
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:18,619
You guys have
to get this thing built.

1152
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:20,688
You guys have to work
with me.

1153
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:23,924
If I wanted to go to Camp Star
I would have signed up.

1154
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:25,660
Okay, that's not fair.

1155
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,127
I'm just trying
to get stuff done,

1156
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,296
but if you guys don't care--

1157
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:29,997
Mitchie.

1158
00:57:30,065 --> 00:57:32,567
We all care,
but you gotta lighten up.

1159
00:57:32,634 --> 00:57:36,003
Really?
And what will that get us?

1160
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:41,542
All right, okay.
Let's do it again.

1161
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,179
That girl is taking the F-U-N
out of summer.

1162
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:47,081
There is no F-U-N
in summer.

1163
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:48,249
Exactly.

1164
00:57:48,317 --> 00:57:50,218
Seriously, I love her,

1165
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:52,019
but I'm goanna kill her.

1166
00:57:56,725 --> 00:58:00,428
Okay, I think you know
what you've gotta do.

1167
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:03,130
I'm on it.

1168
00:58:03,198 --> 00:58:05,633
{all shouting}

1169
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:08,569
Guys, guys, calm down.

1170
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:11,138
She didn't say no,
she said she'd think about it.

1171
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:17,411
All work and no spray
makes a very unhappy rocker.

1172
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:20,348
So I got a proposition
for you guys.

1173
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:21,716
You think you're up for it?

1174
00:58:23,752 --> 00:58:26,821
Okay, we have a ton of stuff
to go over.

1175
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:28,956
Where is everybody?

1176
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:30,190
{sighs}

1177
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:32,292
Seriously, people have got
to start being on time.

1178
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,095
{kids shouting}

1179
00:58:34,162 --> 00:58:35,863
Attack!

1180
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:37,932
{rock music playing}

1181
00:59:05,193 --> 00:59:08,663
Oh, this was not
on the schedule.

1182
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:15,770
Are you kidding? This is what
summer camp is all about.

1183
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:18,205
Counterattack!

1184
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:22,409
{laughs}

1185
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,049
Come on!

1186
00:59:28,116 --> 00:59:29,850
{all laughing and shouting}

1187
00:59:32,988 --> 00:59:34,155
Come on, then.

1188
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:39,026
BOY 1: I know.
GIRL: It's so high.

1189
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:41,528
BOY 2: Look at that.
BOY 3: That's a lot of fire.

1190
00:59:41,596 --> 00:59:43,564
So fun today.
Today was so awesome.

1191
00:59:43,631 --> 00:59:46,133
Yeah.
Has anybody seen Mitchie?

1192
00:59:46,201 --> 00:59:47,735
Um, I don't know.

1193
00:59:47,803 --> 00:59:49,036
She missed dinner.

1194
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:52,239
Okay, thanks.

1195
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,175
Look at our fire.

1196
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,275
{laughs}

1197
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:56,844
{door opens}

1198
00:59:57,913 --> 00:59:59,413
{door closes}

1199
01:00:02,617 --> 01:00:04,685
Your sheet music's soggy.

1200
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:06,921
Just pouring myself
into my music.

1201
01:00:06,988 --> 01:00:07,988
{chuckles}

1202
01:00:08,056 --> 01:00:10,324
That was bad.
Yeah, I know.

1203
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:12,093
Um...

1204
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,728
Are you here to help?

1205
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:15,462
I can't.

1206
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,931
Why?

1207
01:00:16,998 --> 01:00:20,467
Because you and I are going
on a moonlight picnic.

1208
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:22,569
Now?
Right now.

1209
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:24,571
How could you--

1210
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:26,207
Because I'm that nice
of a guy.

1211
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:28,142
--think that I would just
go running off?

1212
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,409
Are you saying no?

1213
01:00:29,477 --> 01:00:31,979
Do you not understand everything
that needs to get done?

1214
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,048
How could I not?
You remind me every two seconds.

1215
01:00:34,116 --> 01:00:36,583
And the water-balloon fight.
I mean, what were you thinking?

1216
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:39,053
I was thinking, "Wouldn't it be
nice to have a little fun?"

1217
01:00:39,121 --> 01:00:40,587
So you're saying I'm not fun?

1218
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:42,857
Why do I even keep trying?

1219
01:00:42,924 --> 01:00:44,391
The whole reason I came
was because--

1220
01:00:44,459 --> 01:00:46,260
I know. It was to get
to know me better.

1221
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:47,494
Well, guess what.
This is me

1222
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:49,663
trying to save something
that I care about.

1223
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,365
So am I.
Really?

1224
01:00:51,432 --> 01:00:52,733
And how's that working out
for you?

1225
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:54,835
Not so great.

1226
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,540
Shane.

1227
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:04,678
You forgot your flashlight.

1228
01:01:27,735 --> 01:01:29,436
{playing soft music}

1229
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:42,416
¶¶ It's like he doesn't hear
A word I say ¶¶

1230

¶¶ And I don't know
How to get there ¶¶

1232
01:01:49,624 --> 01:01:52,759
¶¶ All he wants is to chill out ¶¶
¶¶ She's way too serious ¶¶

1233
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,361
¶¶ He makes me wanna pull
All my hair out ¶¶

1234
01:01:54,429 --> 01:01:57,331
¶¶ She's always in a rush
And interrupting ¶¶

1235
01:01:57,398 --> 01:02:00,935
¶¶ Like he doesn't even care ¶¶
¶¶ Like she doesn't even care ¶¶

¶¶ You ¶¶

BOTH:
¶¶ But we don't see eye to eye ¶¶

1239
01:02:06,407 --> 01:02:09,009
¶¶ Like fire and rain ¶¶
¶¶ Like fire and rain ¶¶

1240
01:02:09,077 --> 01:02:11,846
¶¶ You can drive me insane ¶¶
¶¶ You can drive me insane ¶¶

1241

BOTH:
¶¶ But I can't stay mad at you
For anything ¶¶

¶¶ We're like different stars ¶¶
¶¶ Like different stars ¶¶

1244
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:28,195
¶¶ But you're the harmony
To every song I sing ¶¶

1245
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:32,733
¶¶ And I wouldn't change
A thing ¶¶

1246
01:02:35,103 --> 01:02:37,771
¶¶ She's always trying'
To save the day ¶¶

1247
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,574
¶¶ Just wanna let
My music play ¶¶

1248
01:02:40,641 --> 01:02:45,645
¶¶ She's all or nothing
But my feelings never change ¶¶

1249
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:47,514
¶¶ Why does he try to read
My mind? ¶¶

1250
01:02:47,582 --> 01:02:51,785
¶¶ I try to read her mind ¶¶
¶¶ Not good to psychoanalyze ¶¶

1251
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:53,487
¶¶ She tries to pick a fight
To get attention ¶¶

1252
01:02:53,554 --> 01:02:56,590
BOTH:
¶¶ It's what all
Of my friends say ¶¶

{mellow theme playing}

1280
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,295
Where is everybody?

1281
01:05:23,137 --> 01:05:24,437
{sighs}

1282
01:05:29,543 --> 01:05:32,813
PEGGY:
All right, now let's look at
the alto harmony on measure 15.

1283
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,448
There's a four-bar rest.

1284
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:37,050
Good morning.

1285
01:05:37,118 --> 01:05:38,985
Morning.

1286
01:05:40,054 --> 01:05:41,021
Oh, hold on.

1287
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:42,455
What's going on?

1288
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,960
You were right.
It shouldn't be all up to you.

1289
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,061
And we do need
to step it up.

1290
01:05:48,129 --> 01:05:51,431
Shane got everybody up
before dawn.

1291
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:54,267
He can be pretty persuasive
when he wants to be.

1292
01:05:54,335 --> 01:05:57,170
Morning. Sleep well?

1293
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:01,441
I don't think you got
the new arrangement yet.

1294
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:03,409
Needed a lot of work.

1295
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:06,579
You did this?

1296
01:06:06,647 --> 01:06:07,580
We all did.

1297
01:06:07,648 --> 01:06:09,616
ALL:
Yeah.

1298
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:13,720
I already know
I'm goanna love it.

1299
01:06:13,788 --> 01:06:14,821
Thank you.

1300
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:16,422
You're welcome.

1301
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:19,726
All right,
let's get started.

1302
01:06:19,794 --> 01:06:22,395
We gotta rock this stage
like we own it, right?

1303
01:06:22,463 --> 01:06:23,797
{plays short beat}

1304
01:06:23,865 --> 01:06:26,900
Now, I can hear you,
but I gotta see you play.

1305
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:28,168
Nate, show them how it's done.

1306
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:29,602
Like this.

1307
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:34,141
Excellent.

1308
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:35,642
Jason, show them how to rock.

1309
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:38,078
Okay, guys, not like this:
But like this:

1310
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:40,480
{strumming}

1311
01:06:40,547 --> 01:06:42,649
{all strumming}

1312
01:06:42,716 --> 01:06:44,217
Good job.

1313
01:06:45,253 --> 01:06:46,452
Well, it's easy for you guys,

1314
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,354
but we're not all
rock stars.

1315
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:49,589
But you can be.

1316
01:06:49,657 --> 01:06:50,891
{all cheering and applauding}

1317
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,759
{playing upbeat rock music}

1318
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:53,827
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

1319
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:58,965
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

1320
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:01,467
¶¶ All right ¶¶

1321
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,072
¶¶ Mm-hm-hm ¶¶

1322
01:07:07,809 --> 01:07:11,511
¶¶ Gather round, guys
It's time to start listening' ¶¶

1323
01:07:11,578 --> 01:07:14,815
¶¶ Practice makes perfect
But perfect's not working' ¶¶

1324
01:07:14,882 --> 01:07:17,017
¶¶ There's a lot more to music ¶¶

1325
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:19,719
¶¶ Than knowing where
Your cue's goanna be ¶¶

1326
01:07:22,023 --> 01:07:24,457
¶¶ You can play
All the right notes ¶¶

1327
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,860
¶¶ But that don't mean
You're moving me ¶¶

1328
01:07:28,296 --> 01:07:32,398
¶¶ But if you can jump
Like David Lee Roth ¶¶

1329
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,802
¶¶ Or pump your fist
Like you're Bruce the Boss ¶¶

1330
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:39,005
¶¶ If you got heart and soul ¶¶

1331
01:07:39,073 --> 01:07:41,708
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1332
01:07:43,144 --> 01:07:45,378
¶¶ Rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1333
01:07:47,915 --> 01:07:51,218
¶¶ Strum it, drum it
Slide across and run it ¶¶

1334
01:07:51,285 --> 01:07:54,420
¶¶ The stage is your home
If you learn how to own it ¶¶

1335
01:07:54,488 --> 01:07:56,990
¶¶ Like the greats did ¶¶

1336
01:07:57,058 --> 01:07:59,726
¶¶ There's no way
That you can fake it ¶¶

1337
01:08:01,395 --> 01:08:04,564
¶¶ You've gotta feel the beat
Before you can move ¶¶

1338
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:08,001
¶¶ Even though you're not wearing
Blue suede shoes ¶¶

1339
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:11,972
¶¶ And making' mistakes
Well, that won't matter ¶¶

1340
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:15,408
¶¶ If you can swagger
Like you're Mick Jagger ¶¶

1341
01:08:15,476 --> 01:08:19,012
¶¶ If you've got heart and soul ¶¶

1342
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,248
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1343
01:08:22,616 --> 01:08:25,752
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1344
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:26,987
¶¶ Whoo, solo ¶¶

1345
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:44,971
¶¶ If you live and die
For the music inside ¶¶

1346
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:47,640
¶¶ If the one-four-five
Never gets old ¶¶

1347
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,943
¶¶ Then you can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1348
01:08:52,113 --> 01:08:53,947
¶¶ Rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1349
01:08:55,549 --> 01:08:57,450
¶¶ All right, now, take it low ¶¶

1350
01:08:57,518 --> 01:09:00,620
¶¶ Now, I need the spotlight
To hit me right here ¶¶

1351
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:03,390
¶¶ As the crowd starts to cheer ¶¶

1352
01:09:03,457 --> 01:09:05,325
¶¶ I need the fan to blow
Right through ¶¶

1353
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:08,261
¶¶ My rock-star hair ¶¶

1354
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:09,896
¶¶ Right here ¶¶

1355
01:09:09,964 --> 01:09:13,300
¶¶ If you can scream
Like Axl Rose ¶¶

1356
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:17,003
¶¶ Or sing like Christina
Show after show ¶¶

1357
01:09:17,071 --> 01:09:20,173
¶¶ If you've got heart and soul ¶¶

1358
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:24,144
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

1359
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:27,447
¶¶ If you've got heart and soul ¶¶

1360
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:31,017
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1361
01:09:31,085 --> 01:09:34,620
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1362
01:09:34,688 --> 01:09:35,688
¶¶ Ooh ¶¶

1363
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:36,889
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

1364
01:09:42,263 --> 01:09:44,297
¶¶ You can rock 'n' roll ¶¶

1365
01:09:44,365 --> 01:09:46,166
{all cheering}

1366
01:09:55,209 --> 01:09:56,509
¶¶ Oh ¶¶

1367
01:09:58,746 --> 01:10:00,480
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

1368
01:10:02,216 --> 01:10:04,818
¶¶ All right ¶¶

1369
01:10:04,886 --> 01:10:07,187
Hi, Nate.
{grunts}

1370
01:10:07,255 --> 01:10:08,755
Oh, I-- I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

1371
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:11,258
Hi, Dana.

1372
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:13,326
What are you doing here?

1373
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:14,394
What do you think?

1374
01:10:14,461 --> 01:10:16,029
You came to see me?

1375
01:10:16,097 --> 01:10:17,730
Good guess.

1376
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,201
Well, here I am.

1377
01:10:22,837 --> 01:10:23,837
{laughs}

1378
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:25,872
That's it?

1379
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:27,774
I came all the way over here
in a canoe

1380
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:29,242
risking my father's wrath,

1381
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:33,780
and that's all
you have to say to me?

1382
01:10:33,848 --> 01:10:36,049
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to say.

1383
01:10:36,117 --> 01:10:38,785
There's nothing
you're supposed to say.

1384
01:10:38,853 --> 01:10:41,321
Every day I see you looking
and waving and I'm all,

1385
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:43,589
"That's so sweet.
I so like him."

1386
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,326
You do? Really, that's--
That's what you say?

1387
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:48,661
But then--
"But then"?

1388
01:10:48,729 --> 01:10:50,763
Ah. That's never good.

1389
01:10:50,832 --> 01:10:52,565
How do I really know

1390
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:54,100
if I don't know anything
about you?

1391
01:10:55,937 --> 01:10:57,570
I guess I just thought
you were different.

1392
01:10:57,638 --> 01:10:58,705
I am different.

1393
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:00,707
No, you're not.

1394
01:11:00,774 --> 01:11:03,877
You're exactly like every other
teenage boy in the world.

1395
01:11:03,945 --> 01:11:06,579
Have you ever told me anything
about yourself?

1396
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:08,581
You know, other than
you like canoeing.

1397
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:12,452
Well, I don't really
like canoeing.

1398
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:15,255
Oh. Oh, good.

1399
01:11:15,323 --> 01:11:18,558
So I really know nothing
about you.

1400
01:11:20,828 --> 01:11:23,063
I still don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

1401
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:29,102
I think you just did.

1402
01:11:30,338 --> 01:11:31,704
{sighs}

1403
01:11:31,772 --> 01:11:33,706
{soft pop music playing}

1404
01:11:33,774 --> 01:11:36,076
¶¶ Words don't come easy ¶¶

1405
01:11:36,143 --> 01:11:37,410
Idiot.

1406
01:11:37,478 --> 01:11:40,613
¶¶ Without a melody ¶¶

1407
01:11:40,681 --> 01:11:43,449
¶¶ I'm always thinking' ¶¶

1408
01:11:43,517 --> 01:11:47,087
¶¶ In terms of do-re-mi ¶¶

1409
01:11:47,154 --> 01:11:49,489
¶¶ I should be hiking' ¶¶

1410
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,992
¶¶ Swimming' ¶¶

1411
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:54,794
¶¶ Laughing' with you ¶¶

1412
01:11:54,862 --> 01:11:57,998
¶¶ Instead I'm all
Out of tune ¶¶

1413
01:11:58,065 --> 01:11:59,665
Special order.

1414
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,369
¶¶ But what you don't know ¶¶

1415
01:12:02,436 --> 01:12:04,971
¶¶ You lift me
Off of the ground ¶¶

1416
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:07,374
¶¶ Your inspiration ¶¶
{inaudible dialogue}

1417
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:10,277
¶¶ You help me find my sound ¶¶

1418
01:12:10,344 --> 01:12:13,413
¶¶ Just like a bass line
In half time ¶¶

1419
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,515
¶¶ You hold down the groove ¶¶

1420
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:19,852
¶¶ That's why I'm counting'
On you ¶¶

1421
01:12:21,622 --> 01:12:26,326
DUO:
¶¶ And when I hear you
On the radio ¶¶

1422
01:12:26,394 --> 01:12:30,463
¶¶ I never want to change
a single note ¶¶

1423
01:12:30,531 --> 01:12:35,802
¶¶ It's what I tried to say
All along ¶¶

1424
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:39,539
¶¶ You're my favourite song ¶¶

1425
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:40,840
¶¶ My favourite song ¶¶

1426
01:12:40,908 --> 01:12:43,443
¶¶ And when I hear you
On the radio ¶¶

1427
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:45,312
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶

1428
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:49,316
¶¶ I never want to change
A single note ¶¶

1429
01:12:49,383 --> 01:12:50,750
¶¶ No, no ¶¶

1430
01:12:50,818 --> 01:12:54,955
¶¶ It's what I tried to say
All along ¶¶

1431
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:58,925
¶¶ You're my favourite song ¶¶

1432
01:12:59,961 --> 01:13:03,296
¶¶ You're my favourite song ¶¶

1433
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,101
{sighs}

1434
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:13,506
I take back what I said
about girlfriends.

1435
01:13:13,574 --> 01:13:16,276
It's all good, because at this
rate, I'll never have one.

1436
01:13:16,344 --> 01:13:17,510
What do you mean?

1437
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:19,812
Well, there's this girl.

1438
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,681
I kind of figured.

1439
01:13:21,748 --> 01:13:24,917
I really like her,
but I'm having a hard time

1440
01:13:24,986 --> 01:13:26,386
telling her
how I really feel.

1441
01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:29,356
You're a rock star, dude.
Use it.

1442
01:13:29,423 --> 01:13:31,291
I don't think she cares.

1443
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,427
She just wants to know all this
stupid, random stuff about me.

1444
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:36,496
It's not random stuff.

1445
01:13:36,563 --> 01:13:37,964
She just wants to know
you care enough

1446
01:13:38,032 --> 01:13:39,932
to let her know
who you are.

1447
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:42,768
Well, I care.

1448
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:44,737
But I just don't know
how to say it.

1449
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:48,774
Well, if you can't say it,
you can sing it.

1450
01:13:56,783 --> 01:13:58,418
{mellow theme playing}

1451
01:14:03,424 --> 01:14:06,692
{suspenseful theme playing}

1452
01:14:09,163 --> 01:14:11,731
Every single time
I'm trying to sing my high note,

1453
01:14:11,798 --> 01:14:13,666
I keep getting lost
behind her big head.

1454
01:14:13,734 --> 01:14:14,734
Oh, no, you didn't.

1455
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,102
You couldn't stand
the spotlight.

1456
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:17,203
TESS:
Now that you mention,

1457
01:14:17,271 --> 01:14:18,338
I'm not trying to do anything.

1458
01:14:18,406 --> 01:14:19,605
AXEL:
Enough!

1459
01:14:19,673 --> 01:14:22,142
We'll run it again
in three minutes.

1460
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:25,711
And this time, remember,
it's not amateur hour.

1461
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:27,847
He means you.

1462
01:14:32,453 --> 01:14:33,586
Hi, Dana.
Oh!

1463
01:14:33,654 --> 01:14:36,056
Kind of makes you jump,
doesn't it?

1464
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:38,124
You shouldn't be here.

1465
01:14:38,192 --> 01:14:40,160
I know,
but I couldn't wait.

1466
01:14:40,227 --> 01:14:42,195
Wait for what?

1467
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:47,467
It's a list of things
that nobody knows about me.

1468
01:14:49,002 --> 01:14:50,336
Two minutes.

1469
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:52,172
I really gotta go.
I'm sorry.

1470
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,340
Wait. We still have
two minutes.

1471
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:56,543
Okay.

1472
01:14:58,212 --> 01:15:00,513
{playing soft music}

1473
01:15:02,683 --> 01:15:05,985
¶¶ I'm
I'm good at wasting time ¶¶

1474
01:15:06,053 --> 01:15:07,920
¶¶ I think lyrics
Need to rhyme ¶¶

1475
01:15:07,988 --> 01:15:09,822
¶¶ And you're not asking' ¶¶

1476
01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:11,924
¶¶ But I'm trying' to grow
A mustache ¶¶

1477
01:15:11,992 --> 01:15:16,296
¶¶ I eat cheese
But only on pizza, please ¶¶

1478
01:15:16,363 --> 01:15:19,832
¶¶ And sometimes
On a homemade quesadilla ¶¶

1479
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,702
¶¶ Otherwise it smells
Like feet to me ¶¶

1480
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:25,705
¶¶ And I, I really like it
When the moon ¶¶

1481
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,540
¶¶ Looks like a toenail ¶¶

1482
01:15:27,608 --> 01:15:33,346
¶¶ And I love it when you say
My name ¶¶

1483
01:15:33,414 --> 01:15:35,448
Places, everybody. Come on.

1484
01:15:35,516 --> 01:15:36,782
¶¶ If you wanna know
Here it goes ¶¶

1485
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:38,184
¶¶ Gonna tell you
There's a part of me ¶¶

1486
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:39,619
¶¶ That shows if we're close ¶¶

1487
01:15:39,686 --> 01:15:42,688
¶¶ Gonna let you
See everything ¶¶

1488
01:15:42,756 --> 01:15:45,091
¶¶ But remember that you asked
For it ¶¶

1489
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:47,127
¶¶ I'll try to do my best
To impress ¶¶

1490
01:15:47,194 --> 01:15:49,596
¶¶ But it's easier to let you
Take a guess at the rest ¶¶

1491
01:15:49,663 --> 01:15:53,699
¶¶ But you wanna hear what lives
In my brain and my heart ¶¶

1492
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:55,502
¶¶ Well, you asked for it ¶¶

1493
01:15:55,569 --> 01:16:00,240
¶¶ For your perusing
At times confusing ¶¶

1494
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:02,808
¶¶ Slightly amusing ¶¶

1495
01:16:02,876 --> 01:16:06,179
¶¶ Introducing me ¶¶

1496
01:16:06,247 --> 01:16:08,515

¶¶ I never trust a dog
To watch my food ¶¶

1503
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:25,265
¶¶ And I like to use
The word "dude" ¶¶

1504
01:16:25,332 --> 01:16:28,268
¶¶ As a noun or an adverb
Or an adjective ¶¶

1505

¶¶ And I
I never really been into cars ¶¶

¶¶ I like really cool guitars
And superheroes ¶¶

1507

On 'em ¶¶

¶¶ Introducing me ¶¶

1521
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:17,116
¶¶ Well, you probably know
More than you ever wanted to ¶¶

1522
01:17:17,184 --> 01:17:22,054
¶¶ So be careful when you ask
Next time ¶¶

1523
01:17:22,122 --> 01:17:23,556
AXEL:
Dana!

1524
01:17:23,624 --> 01:17:25,225
¶¶ So if you wanna know
Here it goes ¶¶

1525
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:27,460
¶¶ Gonna tell you there's a part
Of me to show if we're close ¶¶

1526
01:17:27,528 --> 01:17:29,995
¶¶ Gonna let you see
Everything ¶¶

1527
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:32,131
¶¶ But remember
That you asked for it ¶¶

1528
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:34,334
¶¶ I'll try to do my best
To impress ¶¶

1529
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:36,302
¶¶ But it's easier to let you
Take a guess at the rest ¶¶

1530
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:39,305
¶¶ But you wanna hear what lives
In my brain and my heart ¶¶

1531
01:17:39,373 --> 01:17:40,673
¶¶ Well, you asked for it ¶¶

1532
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:45,077
¶¶ For your perusing
At times confusing ¶¶

1533
01:17:45,145 --> 01:17:47,079
¶¶ Hopefully amusing ¶¶

1534
01:17:47,147 --> 01:17:50,149
¶¶ Introducing me ¶¶

1535
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:52,118
¶¶ Do-do, do-do, do-do-do ¶¶

1536
01:17:52,185 --> 01:17:53,853
¶¶ Do-do, do-do, do-do-do ¶¶

1537
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,588
¶¶ Do-do, do-do ¶¶

1538
01:17:55,656 --> 01:17:59,592
¶¶ Introducing me ¶¶

1539
01:18:00,894 --> 01:18:03,663
Dana. Everyone's waiting.

1540
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:05,298
Sorry. It's my fault.

1541
01:18:05,366 --> 01:18:08,601
Why don't you save the theatrics
for the competition?

1542
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:10,503
It's okay.

1543
01:18:10,571 --> 01:18:12,204
Go.

1544
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,407
Thank you.

1545
01:18:15,743 --> 01:18:17,510
We'll talk about this later.

1546
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,081
{acoustic theme playing}

1547
01:18:29,556 --> 01:18:32,725
And all that was left

1548
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:35,861
was a bloody footprint.

1549
01:18:35,929 --> 01:18:37,363
{gasps}

1550
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:40,233
Lame.
Not even scary.

1551
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,502
Yeah, totally
not scary at all.

1552
01:18:42,569 --> 01:18:44,337
Okay, time for bed.
Turn on the lights.

1553
01:18:44,404 --> 01:18:45,571
But you called
"lights out."

1554
01:18:45,639 --> 01:18:47,039
I know what I called.

1555
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:52,245
What was that?
{all laugh}

1556
01:18:57,151 --> 01:19:00,219
Jason, do you think
we're goanna win?

1557
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:01,320
Yeah, Jason.

1558
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:02,688
BOY:
Do you think we're goanna win?

1559
01:19:02,756 --> 01:19:05,224
Of course we're goanna win.
You guys are rock stars.

1560
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:07,793
But what if they are too?

1561
01:19:10,597 --> 01:19:13,199
I guess I really
didn't think about that.

1562
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:17,236
Good night.

1563
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:19,972

1564
01:19:22,776 --> 01:19:24,777
{mischievous theme playing}

1565
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:27,680
Everybody up.

1566
01:19:27,747 --> 01:19:29,649
JASON:

1567
01:19:29,716 --> 01:19:31,384
Follow my lead.

1568
01:19:31,451 --> 01:19:32,885
We're on a mission.

1569
01:19:32,952 --> 01:19:34,953
{suspenseful theme playing}

1570
01:19:39,393 --> 01:19:41,661
Okay, guys, stay low. Roll.

1571
01:19:41,728 --> 01:19:43,896
Oh! Oh, a rock!
Ow, ow, ow!

1572
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:46,199
Okay. Don't roll.

1573
01:19:46,266 --> 01:19:49,402
Okay, gently, guys.
Come on, carefully.

1574
01:19:49,469 --> 01:19:51,571
Single file.
Slow. Careful.

1575
01:19:51,638 --> 01:19:53,339
Come on. Shh.

1576
01:19:53,407 --> 01:19:55,575

1578
01:20:01,415 --> 01:20:02,415
JASON:
Go, go.

1579
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,230
¶¶ You can play a song
Almost any groove ¶¶

1580
01:20:17,297 --> 01:20:20,733

Break it down ¶¶

1581
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,934

1582
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:26,138

1596
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:04,343
¶¶ Then I'll hit the floor
Hit the floor, ooh ¶¶

1597

¶¶ Walking' in my shoes ¶¶

1626
01:22:23,156 --> 01:22:25,023
¶¶ Hey ¶¶

1627
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:26,925
Well?

1628
01:22:26,993 --> 01:22:28,394
Good.

1629
01:22:28,462 --> 01:22:30,529
Maybe great.

1630
01:22:30,597 --> 01:22:33,232
But this competition
isn't about maybe.

1631
01:22:33,299 --> 01:22:36,068
Okay, fine. But can you tell
her to stay out of my light?

1632
01:22:36,135 --> 01:22:38,070
Well, maybe if you would
stay out of my way,

1633
01:22:38,137 --> 01:22:39,972
it wouldn't
be a problem.

1634
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:42,241
Let me see "Tear it Down"
instead.

1635
01:22:42,308 --> 01:22:44,543
{all groan}
AXEL: Let's reset, people.

1636
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:46,912
Come on. Move!

1637
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,915
This has to be perfect.

1638
01:22:51,284 --> 01:22:53,636
Camp Rock isn't goanna know
what hit them.

1639
01:22:56,874 --> 01:22:58,207
{all chattering}

1640
01:22:58,275 --> 01:23:00,843
And the stage was, like,
super-cool.

1641
01:23:00,911 --> 01:23:02,311
It's huge.

1642
01:23:02,379 --> 01:23:04,580
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up.

1643
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,515
Wait, so it's just
Tess and Luke singing?

1644
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,651
Yeah, pretty much. Everybody
else is doing something,

1645
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,319
but they're definitely
the stars.

1646
01:23:10,387 --> 01:23:12,288
But this makes it
so much easier.

1647
01:23:12,355 --> 01:23:14,157
We could totally win
this thing.

1648
01:23:14,224 --> 01:23:15,357
How so?

1649
01:23:15,425 --> 01:23:17,359
Oh, come on.
Even I get it.

1650
01:23:17,427 --> 01:23:18,861
I don't care
what they're singing,

1651
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:21,363
but you and Shane are better
than Tess and Luke any day.

1652
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:24,233
But Shane and I
aren't even singing together.

1653
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:26,635
But you originally
wrote the song as a duet.

1654
01:23:26,704 --> 01:23:28,004
I know, but I--

1655
01:23:28,072 --> 01:23:29,972
You're our two
strongest singers.

1656
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,075
And we know
you have chemistry.

1657
01:23:33,643 --> 01:23:35,444
It's just,
everybody worked so hard.

1658
01:23:35,512 --> 01:23:36,913
Yeah, to help save the camp.

1659
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,515
If the two of you singing alone
on-stage can help us win,

1660
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:40,883
you have to do it.

1661
01:23:40,951 --> 01:23:42,151
Then it's settled.

1662
01:23:42,219 --> 01:23:43,419
ALL:
Yeah!

1663
01:23:47,925 --> 01:23:50,259
{melancholy theme playing}

1664
01:24:00,204 --> 01:24:02,238
Remember when Audrey
jumped on Jason?

1665
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:04,673
Man, the shaving cream
was the best one.

1666
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:11,848
You guys okay
with just Shane and I singing?

1667
01:24:11,915 --> 01:24:13,182
Yeah, we're good.

1668
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,718
I was just looking forward
to doing some of my new moves.

1669
01:24:15,786 --> 01:24:17,186
But it's okay,

1670
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:19,388
if it means we get to come back
here next summer.

1671
01:24:19,456 --> 01:24:21,157
You guys had a good summer?

1672
01:24:21,225 --> 01:24:22,625
Only the best summer ever.

1673
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:28,664
{Mitchie laughing}

1674
01:24:38,142 --> 01:24:40,542
You guys just gave me
the best idea ever.

1675
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:43,112
Ew!
Thank you!

1676
01:24:44,714 --> 01:24:48,484
Hey, guys, new plan.
Everyone meet in ten minutes.

1677

Kids, make sure to have

01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:08,771
--and let us know who you think
sang out

1685
01:25:08,839 --> 01:25:11,107
and who you think
hit a wrong note.

1686
01:25:11,175 --> 01:25:14,944
What's your favourite camp,
Camp Star or Camp Rock?

1687
01:25:15,012 --> 01:25:16,378
And we're out.

1688
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:17,379
Okay.

1689
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:19,182
Georgina.

1690
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:22,418
It's great to see you.

1691
01:25:22,485 --> 01:25:23,986
As always, Axel.

1692
01:25:24,054 --> 01:25:25,221
{laughs}

1693
01:25:25,289 --> 01:25:26,823
Well, I'm goanna go backstage

1694
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:28,424
and do some stand-ups
before the concert.

1695
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:30,726
Good luck.
Thank you.

1696
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:33,196
All right, let's go get
some interviews backstage

1697
01:25:33,263 --> 01:25:34,630
with some of the campers.

1698
01:25:34,698 --> 01:25:36,232
You, uh-- You know her?

1699
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,800
No, I know everyone.

1700
01:25:37,868 --> 01:25:39,235
But don't worry,

1701
01:25:39,303 --> 01:25:41,437
she doesn't have anything
to do with the voting.

1702
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,872
Oh.

1703
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,606
So I probably
shouldn't hold out hope

1704
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:47,210
for us ever being friends again?

1705
01:25:48,212 --> 01:25:49,812
Probably not.

1706
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,247
Though you never know.

1707
01:25:51,315 --> 01:25:54,183
Next year I might hire you
to run my summer camp.

1708
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:56,085
{chuckles}

1709
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:57,954
Thanks.

1710
01:25:58,021 --> 01:25:59,521
But I'm already booked.

1711
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:06,329
Good luck.
{scoffs}

1712
01:26:06,396 --> 01:26:08,797
I'll be lucky if you don't
forget your words this time.

1713
01:26:08,866 --> 01:26:12,601
By "good luck" I mean
"I hope you fall off the stage."

1714
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:14,337
{scoffs}

1715
01:26:20,878 --> 01:26:22,728
{all cheering and applauding}

1716
01:26:22,795 --> 01:26:26,398
As the sun goes down,
the volume goes up.

1717
01:26:26,466 --> 01:26:29,335
Welcome back to the ultimate
summer-camp showdown,

1718
01:26:29,402 --> 01:26:33,372
where you decide the winner.

1719
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:39,811
Now, first up is Camp Star.

1720
01:26:39,879 --> 01:26:42,080
Now, Camp Star
was founded only this year

1721
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:44,816
by superstar producer
and founder of Star Records,

1722
01:26:44,884 --> 01:26:46,218
Axel Turner...

1723
01:26:46,286 --> 01:26:48,487
{audience cheering}

1724
01:26:50,157 --> 01:26:52,891
...who's been producing
for over 20 years.

1725
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:55,060
Now, I know if I was goanna
study music,

1726
01:26:55,128 --> 01:26:56,895
this is the place
I'd wanna be.

1727
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:59,031
Why is she saying that?

1728
01:26:59,098 --> 01:27:02,901
It's her job. She's supposed
to say nice things.

1729
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:06,272
If she doesn't stop talking,
I think I'm goanna throw up.

1730
01:27:06,339 --> 01:27:07,606
Too late.

1731
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:11,243
Well, there's no
turning back now,

1732
01:27:11,311 --> 01:27:13,812
because the party
has already started.

1733
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,847
Camp Star, everybody.

1734
01:27:15,915 --> 01:27:17,416
{all cheering and applauding}

1735
01:27:19,586 --> 01:27:21,987
{upbeat hip-hop music playing}

1736
01:27:22,055 --> 01:27:24,423
WOMAN:

1745
01:27:45,445 --> 01:27:47,779
¶¶ We'll give you more than
You want and you can handle ¶¶

1746
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,316
¶¶ When we're out on the floor

01:28:05,665 --> 01:28:08,100

01:28:13,306 --> 01:28:16,208

¶¶ Of course you know that ¶¶

¶¶ Tear it up

01:28:50,343 --> 01:28:52,645
¶¶ You can't be like us

1770
01:28:52,712 --> 01:28:55,247
¶¶ We leave you in the dust

1771
01:28:55,315 --> 01:28:57,516

¶¶ We goanna tear it down ¶¶

1784
01:29:35,622 --> 01:29:38,557
{all cheering and applauding}

1785
01:29:45,264 --> 01:29:47,098
GEORGINA:
Camp Star, everyone.

1786
01:29:50,437 --> 01:29:54,673
Oh! Remember, if you loved them
as much as I did,

1787
01:29:54,741 --> 01:29:56,141
call or text in now.

1788
01:29:56,209 --> 01:29:57,643
But don't go anywhere,

1789
01:29:57,711 --> 01:30:01,012
because in a moment
we're goanna hear from Camp Rock.

1790
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,684
What happened to you?

1791
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:09,388
When I get nervous
I sparkle things.

1792
01:30:09,456 --> 01:30:11,223
{laughs}
TESS: Would you stop and listen?

1793
01:30:11,291 --> 01:30:12,524
LUKE:
You sounded good too.

1794
01:30:12,592 --> 01:30:15,760
Hey, you guys
were incredible.

1795
01:30:15,828 --> 01:30:17,196
I know, right?

1796
01:30:17,263 --> 01:30:21,433
Only one thing would've
made it better: doing it solo.

1797
01:30:21,501 --> 01:30:23,102
I totally agree.

1798
01:30:27,073 --> 01:30:28,640
It's this bantery thing
that we--

1799
01:30:31,111 --> 01:30:32,111
Thanks.

1800
01:30:33,713 --> 01:30:35,547
Good luck.

1801
01:30:40,053 --> 01:30:42,087
Quite a performance, eh?

1802
01:30:44,391 --> 01:30:45,590
No denying it.

1803
01:30:45,658 --> 01:30:48,460
But don't count
those votes just yet, love.

1804
01:30:48,528 --> 01:30:50,695
I think you're goanna
be very impressed.

1805
01:30:50,763 --> 01:30:51,863
I don't need
to be impressed.

1806
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:53,698
It'd be a miracle
if Axel didn't win.

1807
01:30:53,766 --> 01:30:55,100
Excuse me?

1808
01:30:55,168 --> 01:30:57,136
Do you know how much money
he spent marketing this?

1809
01:30:57,203 --> 01:30:59,405
He's paying to text and tweet
every cell phone user

1810
01:30:59,472 --> 01:31:00,939
in the western hemisphere.

1811
01:31:01,007 --> 01:31:02,274
You don't even
need to see the show

1812
01:31:02,342 --> 01:31:03,942
to know to vote
for Camp Star.

1813
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:06,045
MAN:
One minute.

1814
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,046
How come I just got a text

1815
01:31:07,113 --> 01:31:08,980
telling me to vote
for Camp Star?

1816
01:31:09,049 --> 01:31:10,315
I just got one too.

1817
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:11,917
Um, it's asking me
if I wanna download

1818
01:31:11,984 --> 01:31:13,385
Camp Star's song
as my ringtone.

1819
01:31:15,221 --> 01:31:16,721
You were really a star.

1820
01:31:16,789 --> 01:31:19,458
Thanks.

1821
01:31:19,526 --> 01:31:21,660
And I really gotta go.

1822
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:25,297
Oh, I hate crust on my bread,
and birds make me nervous.

1823
01:31:26,966 --> 01:31:31,170
Excuse me. Oh, uh, that
performance was amazing.

1824
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:33,004
Thank you.

1825
01:31:33,073 --> 01:31:34,639
Don't you have somewhere
to be?

1826
01:31:34,707 --> 01:31:36,308
Yes, but, you know,

1827
01:31:36,376 --> 01:31:39,311
once you start expressing your
innermost thoughts and feelings,

1828
01:31:39,379 --> 01:31:40,712
it's kind of hard to stop.

1829
01:31:42,615 --> 01:31:43,615
Wish us luck.

1830
01:31:43,683 --> 01:31:45,284
Good luck.

1831
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:48,287
Dana, he is the enemy.

1832
01:31:48,354 --> 01:31:50,055
No, he's not.

1833
01:31:50,123 --> 01:31:52,023
Not everything in life
is a competition.

1834
01:31:53,326 --> 01:31:56,562
But I think I just won.

1835
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:04,002
{all cheering and applauding}

1836
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:06,037
And we're back.
If you liked Camp Star,

1837
01:32:06,106 --> 01:32:08,840
get ready to be blown away
by Camp Rock.

1838
01:32:08,908 --> 01:32:11,009
Now, Camp Rock was founded
by rock icon

1839
01:32:11,077 --> 01:32:14,379
and legendary lead guitarist
Brown Cesario.

1840
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:16,881
{all cheering}

1841
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:18,417
You ready?

1842
01:32:18,485 --> 01:32:20,219
Let's do this.

1843
01:32:21,287 --> 01:32:23,122
Ladies and gentlemen,

1844
01:32:23,189 --> 01:32:25,457
Camp Rock.

1845
01:32:25,525 --> 01:32:28,127
{playing soft music}

1846
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,739
¶¶ They say that life
Is a two-way street ¶¶

1847
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:44,676
¶¶ When you're not sure
You gotta trust your feet ¶¶

1848
01:32:44,744 --> 01:32:48,180
¶¶ To know the right way ¶¶

1849
01:32:48,248 --> 01:32:51,116
¶¶ You can keep on moving
With your head down ¶¶

1850
01:32:51,184 --> 01:32:53,185
¶¶ Or you can stop
And take a look around ¶¶

1851
01:32:53,253 --> 01:32:54,853

GEORGINA:
Weren't they incredible?

1907
01:36:07,547 --> 01:36:11,216
So call in now, and tell us
which summer camp rules.

1908
01:36:11,283 --> 01:36:13,819
And don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back.

1909
01:36:18,758 --> 01:36:21,059
Call in, call in.

1910
01:36:21,126 --> 01:36:22,293
Yes!

1911
01:36:22,362 --> 01:36:24,062

{dramatic theme playing}

1914
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,679
Impressive,
but it'll never sell.

1915
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:46,084
You know, uh, it should still
be about the music.

1916
01:36:46,152 --> 01:36:48,153
Maybe so,

1917
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:51,623
but that's why you'll never
make it in this business.

1918
01:36:51,691 --> 01:36:53,425
That's fine.

1919
01:36:53,492 --> 01:36:55,561
I don't wanna be
in your business.

1920
01:36:55,628 --> 01:36:57,796
{chuckles}

1921
01:36:57,864 --> 01:36:59,932
{all cheering and applauding}

1922
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:02,668
And the results are in.

{suspenseful theme playing}

1924
01:37:21,821 --> 01:37:25,057

{strumming}

1927
01:38:34,426 --> 01:38:38,229
You know, I was thinking about
keeping this as a souvenir.

1928
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:41,599
Can't believe we lost.

1929
01:38:46,405 --> 01:38:47,939
Every song
can't be a hit.

1930
01:38:50,543 --> 01:38:52,310
Isn't that
what you told me?

1931
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,149
It doesn't mean
we have to stop singing.

1932
01:39:02,388 --> 01:39:05,390
I'm really sorry I didn't spend
more time with you this summer.

1933
01:39:05,457 --> 01:39:07,759
Hey, the whole reason
I came here--

1934
01:39:07,827 --> 01:39:10,361
Was to get
to know me better.

1935
01:39:10,429 --> 01:39:12,630
And I've learned everything
I need to know.

1936
01:39:13,933 --> 01:39:16,935
{tender theme playing}

1937
01:39:36,422 --> 01:39:38,656
{guitar playing soft music}

1938
01:39:43,295 --> 01:39:47,599

¶¶ This is our song
That's all that matters ¶¶

1943
01:40:04,183 --> 01:40:08,319
¶¶ 'Cause we all belong
Right here together ¶¶

1944
01:40:08,387 --> 01:40:12,423
¶¶ There's nothing' better
Than singing' along ¶¶

1945
01:40:12,491 --> 01:40:16,494
¶¶ This is our summer
This is our song ¶¶

1946
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:24,435
¶¶ Come grab your guitar ¶¶

1947
01:40:24,503 --> 01:40:27,639
¶¶ Sit by the fire ¶¶

1948
01:40:27,706 --> 01:40:31,276
¶¶ 'Cause we all need a song ¶¶

1949
01:40:31,343 --> 01:40:34,946
¶¶ When we're weary and tired ¶¶

1950
01:40:35,014 --> 01:40:39,151
¶¶ We'll sit here together ¶¶

1951
01:40:39,218 --> 01:40:42,320
¶¶ And sing it out loud ¶¶
¶¶ And sing it out loud ¶¶

1952

¶¶ There's nothing' better
Than singing' along ¶¶

1955
01:40:53,132 --> 01:40:59,370
¶¶ This is our summer
And this is our song ¶¶

1956
01:40:59,438 --> 01:41:03,508
¶¶ This is our song ¶¶

1957
01:41:03,575 --> 01:41:07,312
¶¶ This is our song ¶¶

1958
01:41:07,379 --> 01:41:09,714
¶¶ This is our song ¶¶

1959
01:41:11,851 --> 01:41:12,918
What's that?

1960
01:41:14,887 --> 01:41:16,822
GIRL:
Hey, you guys, look.

1961
01:41:16,889 --> 01:41:17,956
Check it out.

{all chattering}

1963
01:41:26,465 --> 01:41:28,733
Hi, we saw the fire.

1964
01:41:28,801 --> 01:41:30,401
We really don't get
to do this kind of thing.

1965
01:41:30,469 --> 01:41:34,706
So we were hoping there was room
for some of us to join.

1966
01:41:34,773 --> 01:41:36,975
There's always room.
Brown, if it's okay with you,

1967
01:41:37,043 --> 01:41:39,277
I'd really like to come back
to Camp Rock next summer.

1968
01:41:39,345 --> 01:41:41,112
Come on.

1969
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:43,748

Na, na-na-na, na ¶¶

Hey, can I get

The phones are going crazy.
Yeah, sure, I'll help.

1973
01:41:51,824 --> 01:41:54,792
I told my parents I wanna
come here instead next summer.

This place
is so much more fun.

1978
01:42:06,438 --> 01:42:08,240
I'm sure we can
work something out.

1979
