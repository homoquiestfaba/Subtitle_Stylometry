1
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,915
- Hey, Sam!
- Hi, Larry.

2
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,368
Morning!

3
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,156
Ready?

4
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,416
Trainee!

5
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,059
Welcome to UMart.

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,020
Easy now. Easy. Easy. Try this, right here.

7
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,059
Oh!

8
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,024
But they're not... Actually, Mr Avery!

9
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,856
- How much does this go for?
- $279.69

10
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,858
$279.69

11
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:36,072
That was a wild ride from this horsey
for that little pickle bug! Wasn't it?

12
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,168
- I am so sorry.
- No, I understand.

13
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,792
This happens all the time,
but it's usually the helicopter.

14
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,935
Ah!

15
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,701
You zone the entire depot, every rack,
before you punch out.

16
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,033
It's not just policy.
It's the right thing to do.

17
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,996
- What'd they say?
- You have to listen twice.

18
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,457
<i>Larry Crowne to the
common break area.</i>

19
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,380
"Larry Crowne to the common break area"?

20
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,178
Yeah, that's what I heard. I wonder why.

21
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,839
It's Employee of the Month day.

22
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,593
Spectacular!

23
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,436
How many will this be?

24
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,851
Oh, I'm not saying. Nine.

25
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,980
Larry Crowne on deck, as ordered.

26
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,983
Hey, Vicky, where were you
in Alvarez' baby pool?

27
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,022
I had last week. What a dope.

28
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,651
Front office personnel are recommended
to leave the employee pools

29
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,074
to the hourly staff, Larry. You know that.

30
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,577
That's too bad.
You could've won a hundred bucks.

31
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,663
Cubby, make tracks, please.

32
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,541
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just taking a break
in the common break area.

33
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,249
You know, I think I know
what this is about.

34
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,499
I don't think you do.

35
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,377
- Crowne...
- Mmm.

36
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,803
There's been a restructuring ordered
throughout the UMart nation.

37
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,508
Now, "restructuring" is their word.

38
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,227
<i>Ask me, it's a pain in the tuchis.</i>

39
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,055
<i>That's right, isn't it,
tuchis, where you get kicked?</i>

40
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,513
- A Yiddish word, yeah.
- Absolutely.

41
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,687
<i>- It's like the buttocks.
- Tuchis and buttocks, synonymous.</i>

42
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,227
Well, it hurts when you get kicked back there
no matter what language you're speaking.

43
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,730
You bet.

44
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,156
Larry,

45
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:38,575
I'm sorry, but we've come to a parting
of the ways, UMart and you.

46
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,910
Miss Hurley will explain.

47
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,870
UMart's policy is to never limit
the opportunities of our employees,

48
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,040
no matter their race, gender,
age, sexual orientation.

49
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,043
It's all published on the website.

50
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,047
A mandatory review of the records
of all team leaders has revealed

51
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,882
that you never matriculated
to a university or college.

52
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,768
That makes you a 4
on the advancement scale of 1 to 4,

53
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,937
4 being the least recommended.

54
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:08,392
You're limited in your opportunities
for all further advancement corporate-wide,

55
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,227
and that's something UMart does not do.

56
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,231
That's, uh, something UMart does not do.

57
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,282
Well, this sounds like you're firing me.

58
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,986
See, Larry, here's the problem.

59
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,072
Your lack of educational background

60
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,034
is gonna forever retard your movement
up the UMart ladder.

61
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,205
You're forever retarded, Crowne,
'cause you didn't go to college.

62
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,837
SMU. Class of '86. That's solid gold, man.

63
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,509
They just don't give those away.

64
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,632
Three years, Chico State.

65
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,683
So, that's why everybody's
made front office except me?

66
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,472
You and I
went head-to-head, Larry.

67
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,604
I mean, who'd have thought
I'd get promoted over you?

68
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,475
I chose the Navy
right out of high school.

69
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,069
I did almost 20 years.

70
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,771
Weren't you a cook?

71
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,150
We'd like to thank you for your service
to the nation, Larry,

72
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:01,028
and, frankly, in all seriousness,
for your service to UMart, too,

73
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,113
but that's over with now.

74
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,787
Absolutely. Hey, ho, hey, pizza left.

75
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,619
- One slice. Anybody want it?
- No.

76
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,295
Larry?

77
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,584
No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,002
Listen, please, please,
don't, I cannot be fired.

79
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,803
These last couple years
have just been a bloodbath.

80
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,641
I mean, I have really taken a beating.

81
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,845
Hey, we've all gotten our clocks cleaned
by our ex-wives. Am I right?

82
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,645
Larry, the timing on something like this
is always a bitch.

83
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,359
It's always a bitch.

84
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,650
I thought I was gonna be
Employee of the Month.

85
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,077
Well, in a way, you are.

86
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,548
According to your website,
the position is still open.

87
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,879
So, once again,
this is Larry Crowne with an "E"

88
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,715
calling in regards to any possible

89
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:51,062
retail sales or management position.

90
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,858
It's been filled? Thank you.

91
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,969
Hello! You have got to be the manager,
am I right?

92
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,822
- Wish I could help.
- Yeah.

93
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,905
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks. Thanks anyway.
Times are tough.

94
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,949
Tell me about it.

95
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,497
I'm pointing out that
with very little effort

96
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,754
you can still pay off that 392 K you owe.

97
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,795
No, I can't.

98
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,555
And I was told refinancing
would always be possible.

99
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,343
Well, three years ago,

100
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:16,847
I would have given you half a
million dollars on your signature.

101
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,307
But things change.

102
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:23,610
You're now unemployed, and your house
isn't worth what you still owe.

103
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,862
Mr Crowne, I'm gonna get you
some complimentary coffee,

104
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,030
and we have a lot of good things
to talk about.

105
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,499
Lots of good things.

106
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,291
First on the agenda is
liquidating your assets.

107
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,548
No! Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

108
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,842
What the hell are you doing?

109
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,100
Larry Crowne, there has been a yard sale
at 8642 Derby Court

110
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,223
since Lionel Richie was
dancing on the ceiling.

111
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,600
That means I have a monopoly
on this location.

112
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,523
You go yard on me,
I will have to take you down.

113
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,898
Lamar, I lost my job.

114
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,279
No. You got fired?

115
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,773
- Yes.
- When?

116
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,488
Last Friday.

117
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,873
That's how they do it. On a bloody Friday.

118
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,291
Security walks you out.

119
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,880
Come Monday, the fired man
is the forgotten man. It's diabolical.

120
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,875
They said it's because I
didn't go to college.

121
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,303
And you believed that?
The Man wanted you gone.

122
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,922
Look at my skin color.
I know what I'm talking about.

123
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,550
So, you going on unemployment?

124
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,561
If I have to.

125
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,721
That's not gonna be enough
to cover your nut.

126
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,100
Taking a loan out to buy out
Denise's half of the house,

127
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,103
- that was a bad idea.
- Huh!

128
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,896
I told you how to avoid divorce lawyers.

129
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,776
You get married and you stay married.

130
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,240
Come on.

131
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,743
Come with me. Come on.

132
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,910
Hey, B'Ella. Got anything new?

133
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,084
Ooh, Larry! Dance lessons from the '50s.

134
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,962
You don't have any of these, I promise.

135
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,260
He can't afford them. He lost his job.
They let him go.

136
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,013
- Oh, Larry. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,261
And we gonna get him something better
than a job.

138
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,933
- An education.
- Oh!

139
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,853
Get you some knowledge
and you'll be fireproof.

140
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,228
Oh, yeah, that's right, Larry.
You're never too old to learn.

141
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,481
Just listen to my husband.
He hasn't called The Man boss in years.

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,937
Oh, yeah, I remember why.

143
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,323
Yeah! Yeah! I won! I won!

144
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,744
Whoo! I won all this money!

145
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,337
Well, Uncle Sam took his half.
That's gonna be 50 cents for the book.

146
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,456
They give these away for free.

147
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,209
Well, they do. I don't.

148
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,087
- Ten cents.
- Four dimes, two nickels.

149
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,634
- Twelve cents.
- Half a buck.

150
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,679
- Seventeen cents.
- One dollar and I'll take half off.

151
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,142
Keep it.

152
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,395
Larry, okay, 35 cents, Larry.

153
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,174
Dave Busik, Dean of Student Services.

154
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,756
Oh. Larry Crowne.

155
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,554
Nice to meet you, Larry.
Back to college, huh?

156
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,849
No, no, this is the first time ever for me.

157
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,801
I was in the Navy for 20 years.

158
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,895
Coast Guard. Adventure of a lifetime.

159
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,356
I was a cook.

160
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,938
Culinary specialist.

161
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,353
We teach a whole track
in hotel and restaurant food preparation.

162
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,522
Oh, no, no, no, no, I did that long enough.

163
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,903
Then I got into a whole different
line of work, until I was downsized.

164
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,872
I'm here to make sure
that never happens again.

165
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,825
Say, did you ever think about studying
tai chi?

166
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,121
- No, sir.
- Cured my diabetes, no lie.

167
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,041
I recommend Speech 217.

168
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,751
"The Art of Informal Remarks. "

169
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,046
"From toasts to job interviews,
Speech 217 will teach you

170
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,257
how to communicate
with ease and confidence. "

171
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,760
This class'll change your life.

172
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,642
And you'll like the teacher.

173
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,603
You ready to go to work? How about this?

174
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,601
- Speech 217, Econ 1...
- You bet.

175
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,271
- ... Composition 1. You learn how to talk.
- Right.

176
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,695
You learn how to do business, and you
learn how to write about it.

177
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,869
Three classes, but you're gonna
have to get in there, work.

178
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,344
I'm telling you,
every cop has to stop me, man.

179
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,438
Well, maybe
it's the leather jacket.

180
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,192
- No, it's not.
- Talia gave me this jacket, man.

181
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,149
She said I'd look like a brown James Dean.

182
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,490
Who's James Dean?

183
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,673
Hey! What's cooking there, Joe College?

184
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,957
Can you get this hunk of junk working?

185
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,802
I don't sell junk.
Let me get my good tools.

186
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,009
Larry Crowne. You've got a lot of
money in those albums of yours.

187
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,467
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

188
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,812
They'll sell on the eBay.
I can show you how.

189
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,685
You know this machine is a classic, right?

190
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,563
Yeah, okay. But does it work?

191
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,976
It will for $800.

192
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,729
Oh, Lamar, I'm thinking like 200.

193
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,278
Okay. 700.

194
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,405
- 200.
- 650.

195
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,578
- Gonna be a long day with those two.
- Mmm-hmm.

196
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,155
- 630.
- 200.

197
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,696
626.

198
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,702
Lamar, I have no money.
I'm out of a job. $200.

199
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,506
You're my neighbour.
625, and I'll throw in the oil change.

200
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,466
I have an idea.

201
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:25,096
Okay. This is a simple machine.
All right, this is your gas, your brake.

202
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,222
I want you to put your foot on
that pedal down there.

203
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,437
This is your starter button. Push that.

204
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,650
Nice. You gonna need a special license.

205
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,316
- How fast does it go?
- Oh, pretty...

206
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,360
No, the brake, the brake!

207
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,897
Larry!

208
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,868
Sorry! Sorry!

209
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,363
It's got power!

210
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,505
<i>Please enter your...</i>

211
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,151
What sin did you commit to have a class
at 8:00 a. m.?

212
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,029
Earning a master's in comparative
political discourse

213
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,276
in the plays of Shakespeare and Shaw. You?

214
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:12,447
Well, I just started race-walking
at the track. It was fun.

215
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,950
I hope I am never like that.

216
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,996
When was the last time you looked at
your life and saw nothing but fraud?

217
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,374
How long have you been teaching?

218
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,467
I used to remember.

219
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,170
You're right on time.

220
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:29,349
I wonder if I make a dollop of difference
to anyone sitting in my classroom.

221
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,262
We used to, until Facebook and Twitter killed
whatever attention span they had left.

222
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,015
Well, it's 7:52.
Come on, we gotta get going.

223
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,610
Off I go. On my way.

224
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,572
Time for class.

225
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,219
That's a damn fine Zipper, mister.

226
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,807
It did get me here for a
nickel's worth of gas.

227
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,431
Didn't see you in the
scooter pit last term.

228
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,313
Oh, this is my first day of college, ever.

229
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,023
I love that.

230
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,478
You an ex-cop?

231
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,989
No. Why would you think that?

232
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,368
Tucking in a polo shirt makes you
look like one.

233
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,200
And the glasses don't help.

234
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,532
Well, no, I'm just a student.

235
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,577
You don't happen to know where the Speech
and Communications Building is, do you?

236
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,921
Didn't know there was one.

237
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,260
This is it?

238
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,469
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

239
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,763
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

240
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,057
My day has just been made.

241
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,558
Excuse me?

242
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,277
This class is canceled.

243
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:08,653
The state charter requires a minimum of
10 students per class

244
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,109
or else it costs more for us to be
here than not, so.

245
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,948
I mean, did you really want a class
at 8:00 a. m.? I didn't.

246
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,700
No. Okay, thanks, anyway.

247
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,003
Is this Speech 217?

248
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,921
See if you can find yourself a seat.

249
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:38,345
My name is Miss Tainot,
T-A-I-N-O-T, Tainot.

250
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,351
Not "Tie-knot". Tay-no.

251
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,748
This is what you are going to learn
to do in my class.

252
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:10,711
If you do not care about this class,
then neither do I.

253
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,130
If you do not participate and show
up with enough sleep

254
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:20,854
to make it through the 55 minutes,
three dawns a week, that I have to be here

255
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:26,901
then you do not care about Speech 217,
the Art of Informal Remarks.

256
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,981
So, get out.

257
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:35,610
Get out, now! Go, right now! Go!

258
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,202
It was worth a try. Well, when next we
meet, this is what we're gonna do.

259
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,924
Each of you is going to address the class
for the first time.

260
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,129
You will tell us how to do something
that you already know how to do.

261
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,517
Miss Tie-knot?

262
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,641
Uh, Tay-knot?

263
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,143
Tae-Bo?

264
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,020
Really?

265
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,948
Who are you?

266
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:20,448
Steve Dibiasi. D-I-B-I-A-S-I.

267
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,742
Only two days before I gotta get up and
give my speech?

268
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,708
You may be dreaming.

269
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,214
Why are you here, Steve?

270
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:39,891
Dean of Student Services said
your class would change my life.

271
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,772
I gotta take this.

272
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,400
Yo. Dude, I left it right there.

273
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,572
In the cigar box, under the coffee
table, where it always is.

274
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,447
<i>I didn't check there.</i>

275
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,283
Repeat after me.

276
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,404
Repeat.

277
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,573
Steve cannot take calls right now.

278
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,242
Steve can't take calls right now.

279
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,292
He's learning to care.

280
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,169
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

281
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,481
Hi. We have Speech 217 together.

282
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,604
Can you believe

283
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:40,239
we have to get up and give a speech
in our very next class?

284
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,362
Yeah. She scares me.

285
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,540
- Oh, my God. Fancy this bit of destiny.
- Hello!

286
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,159
I've been thinking about you
and I don't even know your name.

287
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,630
Larry. Larry Crowne. Hi.

288
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,379
This is, uh...

289
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,302
- Lala.
- Lala.

290
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,714
Larry and Lala. I don't think so.

291
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:07,186
I used to be Kathryn, until I looked in
the mirror and saw a girl named Talia.

292
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,555
My real name is Celestina.

293
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,733
Celestina? How gorgeous.

294
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,104
You.

295
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,652
Lance. Lance Corona.

296
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,531
- Wanna join my gang?
- You're in a gang?

297
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:30,164
I hang with like-minded
scooter enthusiasts.

298
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,294
Ugh!

299
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:37,049
I'll give you a text, and you can do
some free-wheeling.

300
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:56,979
You have entered Economics 1,
Econ Prime.

301
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:02,659
Trying to make sense of the complicated
structure of economic law and theory?

302
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,069
It's confusing

303
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,489
until you read this course pack

304
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,376
written by Ed Matsutani, Ph. D.

305
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,039
That's me.

306
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:21,803
Read this and follow me to economic
enlightenment and power.

307
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,108
That usually scares people.

308
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,569
Yet none of you have fled.

309
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,657
A good economic indicator.

310
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,368
Let us begin.

311
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,919
Only four of you.

312
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,544
This class is canceled.

313
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,979
Let's see. Oh.

314
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,315
Oh, hello.

315
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,444
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

316
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,447
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I likey, I likey.

317
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,285
Hey! Who's home early, huh?

318
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,121
Ophelia, out of the pond.

319
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,295
First day of term calls for a celebration.

320
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,001
You'd think so.

321
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,223
Um...

322
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,559
You know what? I built a flamethrower
of a posting for WarriorWeb,

323
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,809
which, if I do say so myself,

324
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,646
<i>would feed nicely as an outline for
Second Angel.</i>

325
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,990
Good for you.

326
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:11,321
Yeah, then I crushed 1,000 calories
at 24-Hour Fitness.

327
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,155
You know no one's there after 9:00 a. m.?

328
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,490
Go figure.

329
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,040
After a smooth nap and a double espresso,

330
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:22,294
man, I hit three hours of Blog and Talk
for CyberShare. Whoa.

331
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,009
You don't believe me.

332
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,839
Why wouldn't I believe you?

333
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:35,098
I'm writing, Mercy. Look, this is what
I do, all day. That's what I do.

334
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,187
Mmm.

335
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,390
You're looking at porn.

336
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,559
What?

337
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,487
Oh!

338
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,032
Fine!

339
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,328
So, yeah, Thought Police, take me away.

340
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,997
I saw some erotica. I'm a man, I admit it.

341
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,534
Took you a while.

342
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,588
Yeah, and it's not... it's barely porn.
And I'm not hiding it.

343
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,878
Yes, you are.

344
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,505
Everybody hides something.

345
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,756
I have no secrets from you.

346
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,884
I walk in that door and fill you in on
every high and low in my day.

347
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,728
Today's low?

348
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,933
A toss-up between a canceled Shakespeare

349
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,564
and an Intro to Ren Lit with 20 heads

350
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,988
who think the Renaissance is a fair
they go to every July.

351
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,782
My high? I'm drinking it.

352
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,406
Mmm-mmm.

353
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,242
Mmm.

354
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,418
Brain freeze.

355
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:46,090
No secrets. It's perfection. That is you.

356
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,590
It gets the bills paid.

357
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,756
See, that's what you hide from me.

358
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,849
I mean, you walk in the door pissed off
because...

359
00:27:55,924 --> 00:28:00,521
And I'm sorry, I have established
a beachhead in new media

360
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,600
while you still teach at
Vassar of the Valley.

361
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,020
And that is what you hide from me.

362
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,691
You look at Bra Busters Triple-X,
hoping I don't know

363
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,902
or don't care, but I do,
and I don't like it.

364
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:21,792
You know, it may look like I don't work
hard around here, Mercy, but I do.

365
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,497
I'm just a guy who is a guy being a guy
when you're not around.

366
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,588
Oh, well, and walking away is great
for a relationship.

367
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,479
I'm a guy who's
a guy being a guy!

368
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,651
That's all!

369
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,532
Everyone says that women's lacrosse
is not a real sport

370
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,657
because you can't body check,
but that's just not true.

371
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,868
If you want to get out your real
aggression before a game

372
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,327
just check yourself against the wall.

373
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,330
And then do 10 push-ups!

374
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:14,379
Be aggressive! B-E aggressive!

375
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,800
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E! Be aggressive!

376
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,853
Thank you. Ladies lacrosse.

377
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,980
I didn't realise. Uh, who's next?

378
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,561
All right. I'll be the bad guy.

379
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,030
Miss Crowne, please.

380
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,400
You mean me?

381
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,865
Mr Crowne, excuse me.

382
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,756
Go.

383
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:55,428
My presentation will be on the very
particular subject

384
00:29:56,378 --> 00:30:00,679
of how to prepare restaurant-quality
French toast.

385
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:05,433
But don't worry, I'll speak in English.

386
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,727
The key ingredients of restaurant-quality
French toast

387
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,030
are bread, eggs

388
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,738
milk, vanilla extract,

389
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,029
oil or melted butter,

390
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,032
cinnamon, nutmeg,

391
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,583
powdered sugar and eggs.

392
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,466
Ahead of myself here.

393
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,254
A few words about syrups.

394
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,550
Thank you. French toast.

395
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,723
Direct and informative.

396
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,643
Next, please.

397
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,899
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I got one now!

398
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,149
You will dig it.

399
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,151
Are you clairvoyant?

400
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,282
No. Steve Dibiasi.

401
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,291
<i>Testing, one,
two, three, testing.</i>

402
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,828
<i>Toaster waffles, the easy breakfast.</i>

403
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,464
<i>Put 'em in a toaster,
wait, pop 'em out.</i>

404
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,837
<i>Eat 'em like a sandwich.</i>

405
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,919
<i>No mess to clean up.</i>

406
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,634
<i>Ding-ding! Applause, please!</i>

407
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,814
He got that from...
That was my French toast.

408
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,437
Who's next?

409
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,365
<i>Well, my speech is on the five dance
steps every man should know.</i>

410
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,911
<i>The first of which is the commonly
known two-step, so.</i>

411
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,499
<i>And for the more advanced,
there's the butterfly.</i>

412
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,848
As I said in chapter three

413
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,848
the science of economics is a
relatively simple discipline

414
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,100
told by hard numbers.

415
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,150
Anyone who can add, subtract, multiply,
and divide can divine its truths.

416
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:21,031
The social science of economics is told
by an ephemeral language.

417
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,859
Contracts, quality differentials,

418
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:31,042
pressure trends, the intangible
elements of the Individual Value Index.

419
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,201
Us? Scoot?

420
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,877
Subtle interpretation is required.

421
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,460
Yeah. Why not?

422
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,342
As is full concentration.

423
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,057
Your device, please.

424
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:57,018
They call them "smart phones", but only
dummies use them in my class.

425
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,112
Let us begin with the quality differential.

426
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,945
Like I don't
know a cop when I see one.

427
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,196
My Dell Gordo.

428
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,002
This is Lance Corona.

429
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,918
Classmate and, so far, good guy.

430
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,880
You gotta untuck the shirt, Lance.

431
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,252
So, you wanna ride with us?

432
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,805
Sure. Why not?

433
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,565
Snap along, Lance, or you
can't join the gang.

434
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,960
Okay, okay. You're in for a trial run.

435
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,365
Hey! How you doing?

436
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,572
Great! Where are we going?

437
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,822
You know, we'll just ride around till
we get a bit hungry

438
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,874
then maybe get a bite to eat.
You know a place?

439
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,576
- Yeah, I know a place.
- Great! Show us!

440
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,045
Follow me!

441
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,398
- Frank's a good guy.
- We're both veterans.

442
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,817
He did 20 years in the Marines.

443
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,774
Hey, kid. You pump iron, don't you?

444
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,400
What do you think?

445
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,320
- I think you're wasting your time.
- Really?

446
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,284
- Yeah, you should just do push-ups.
- Yeah?

447
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,902
Yeah, you see this body here?

448
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,077
One time, it was nothing
but a mass of chiselled muscle and bone.

449
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,955
Really? What year was that?

450
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,037
19-kiss-my-ass.

451
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,050
I better get going. I have homework.

452
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,752
No! We just got boosted.

453
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,338
Yeah, you should come with us. We'll go
check out some junk shops, thrift stores.

454
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,764
Would a yard sale do?

455
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,968
I know a spectacular yard sale.
It's open every day.

456
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,062
Then ye shall lead us, Lance Corona.

457
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,639
Let's go.

458
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,690
Frank, thanks very much!

459
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,268
You're welcome, Larry. Take care.

460
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,280
We're being invaded!

461
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,135
Larry. What kind of thugs did you get
involved with?

462
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,466
- Just my college buddies.
- College buddies?

463
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,971
Whoa, hey, hey, kid, kid, you...

464
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:07,192
TV trays. Postmodernism. That's art.

465
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,476
It's a bargain at 100 bucks apiece.

466
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,854
- For these?
- Yeah.

467
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,315
Look, if you want them,
let's get to haggling.

468
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,322
- A buck apiece.
- Ninety-nine.

469
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,617
- Two bucks.
- Ninety-eight. See how this is working?

470
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,991
Uh-huh. $2.25.

471
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,577
$97.50, and, kid, I do this every day.

472
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,630
No.

473
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,674
No.

474
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,220
These would look perfect on you.
And I think they'll fit.

475
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,764
- Could be really cute.
- Ooh!

476
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:41,101
I'm kidding with you.
Eight bucks and they're yours.

477
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,176
- You almost went for it.
- Uh, no, I didn't, I didn't.

478
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,522
$97.50, you were like,
"Whoa, that's a lot for TV trays,"

479
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,691
but no, no,
not really, when you think about it.

480
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,275
B'Ella says
he keeps his door unlocked.

481
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,984
How trusting.

482
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,197
So, this is where you disappeared to.

483
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,541
It's so cluttered and dark.

484
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,335
Lance, nothing but treasures next door.

485
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,962
Oh, look. He's a man, and he lives alone.

486
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,375
Are you two walking in
on all the neighbours?

487
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,879
Sal cuts hair and she's gonna tackle yours.

488
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,720
- She is?
- Yes, Lance. You need a haircut.

489
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,676
Where's your bathroom?

490
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,553
Uh, back through the bedroom.

491
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,014
Well, come on. First one's free.

492
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,685
How can you breathe with all this stuff?

493
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,106
I usually straighten up on weekends.
I've been busy.

494
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,153
Just go see Sal.

495
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,156
I'm gonna need some muscle here.

496
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,117
So, what is going on out there?

497
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:48,501
Just introducing you
to a little thing called feng shui.

498
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,418
Just gonna get rid of some of
this clutter here, okay?

499
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,582
Yeah, just, you know, don't go crazy.

500
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,047
Let Talia do her thing.
Okay? Life is easier.

501
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,553
Well, I did everything I could.

502
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,099
Nice.

503
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,273
Now I see the Lance of my dreams.

504
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,279
Mr Lance Corona.

505
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,862
Raise your right hand.
Say something patriotic.

506
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:25,076
We'll be right back after these messages.

507
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,782
Welcome to the Street Patrol.

508
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,202
We ride for justice and beauty.

509
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,953
It's a full-time job, Lance.

510
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:36,458
Hey, Lance, remember to bring the sides
forward, pat down the back.

511
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,546
You are way cooler than you appear.

512
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,725
Well, you know, sometimes it just comes
down to a good haircut.

513
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,019
- Thank you!
- Had to be done, Lance!

514
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,687
Oh, Lance.

515
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,944
You know, every man falls
in love with Talia.

516
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,115
And you will, too, if you haven't already.

517
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,491
But I love her the mostest.
Know that right now.

518
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,664
Seriously, don't make me
keep my eyes on you.

519
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,660
- What's your real name, Lance?
- Larry Crowne, with an "E".

520
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,045
Don Gordon, with a "G".

521
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,001
Shake hands.

522
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,003
Look each other in the eyes.

523
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,843
Firm grips. No contest, but firm.

524
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,808
Hold it.

525
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,684
Stack it.

526
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,889
One word, Lance,

527
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,312
peace.

528
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,060
Peace, indeed.

529
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,539
Spectacular!

530
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:51,825
Spectacular!

531
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,419
So, this is feng shui.

532
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,420
Hi, Larry!

533
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,381
Pennies per mile, Lamar! Pennies!

534
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,642
I told you that machine was a classic!

535
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,719
I think he got me on that deal.

536
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,435
♫ I've treacle and toffee

537
00:41:15,436 --> 00:41:18,058
♫ I've tea and I've coffee

538
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:21,654
♫ Soft tommies and succulent chops

539
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,276
<i>Please enter your destination.</i>

540
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:26,942
♫ I've chickens and conies
and pretty polonies

541
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,411
Miss Tainot!

542
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,120
- Miss Tainot!
- ♫ Excellent peppermint drops

543
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,242
I can't believe this.

544
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,416
♫ Then buy of your Buttercup

545
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,964
♫ This man is looking at me

546
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,347
It's Larry Crowne!

547
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,094
Right, hi!

548
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,763
I have you for Speech 217
in just a couple of minutes.

549
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,473
Yes, you do.

550
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,478
- I saw you singing.
- Oh, I'm just drowning out the GPS.

551
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,772
See? It never stops.

552
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,357
Well, no wonder, that's a Map Genie.

553
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,824
Back when I sold you such things,

554
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,199
I would've steered you toward a Vortex,
'cause the Map Genie has...

555
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,030
It's very complicated.

556
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,491
Well, no wonder,
the auto-on feature is engaged.

557
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:18,670
So, menu, select, features,

558
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:21,294
auto, voice select.

559
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,626
Change? Yes. On/off.

560
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,087
Off. Change? Yes.

561
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,174
Save, and back, back, back, back, and exit.

562
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,226
Oh.

563
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,726
- How long was that broken?
- Ever since my husband installed it himself.

564
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,398
- Well, it's all fixed now.
- Thank you.

565
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,850
What are you gonna make us do
today in class, hmm?

566
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,273
You'll just have to find out.

567
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,737
Follow me.

568
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,116
Interesting.

569
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,615
Looking down at your notes,
your hands, is a downer.

570
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,495
Look up at your audience.

571
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:01,918
Find not one but three different focal
points and move your attention to each one.

572
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,216
Start on the one side,
looking into the eyes of whoever's there.

573
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,335
- Hello.
- Hi.

574
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,767
The center is where major points are made.

575
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,179
Make them there.

576
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,901
Once you've come to the other side, you know
you've included everyone in the conversation.

577
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,947
You don't wanna spend too much
time on any one focal point.

578
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,330
If you're looking and speaking
to only one of your audience,

579
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,538
that person may get the wrong

580
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,794
message.

581
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,304
Who wants to be first?

582
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:57,302
If the balance on axis A
is the same metric as axis B,

583
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:02,228
deficits appear because of overhead,
taxes and reinvestment.

584
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,729
Translation?

585
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:07,361
Miss Francesco.

586
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,064
Something very complicated.

587
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,908
Mr Crowne.

588
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,741
The break-even paradox
of the static-flow assumption?

589
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:23,749
That is the correct answer, from page 56.

590
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,589
Someone's been reading the course pack.

591
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,011
While economic law abhors an assumption,

592
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,136
the break-even paradox creates
a whole new metric,

593
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,764
an illusory flow that appears proactive

594
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,767
but is, in fact, static.

595
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:01,158
Holy smoke! You've got inventory.

596
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,616
Yes, I do.

597
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,369
Bad feng shui, though.

598
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:10,084
This is all unproductive capital sitting
here, unless you're selling it on eBay.

599
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,509
Never buy clothes you don't try on.

600
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,259
You have to feel the
fabric and test the drape.

601
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,969
- I don't.
- Take off your pants.

602
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,175
What?

603
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,644
Take off your pants.

604
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,642
Really?

605
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,520
Get behind that rack and
take off your pants!

606
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,778
You know, I can't really afford
all these new threads.

607
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,480
'Tis gratis, Lance.

608
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,528
Lance, my boyfriend's here.
Put your pants back on.

609
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:40,739
Yeah, Lance.

610
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,411
Put your pants back on.

611
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,169
Oh...

612
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,677
These are a little tight.

613
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,347
Hold on.

614
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,392
Two more, please.

615
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,525
I knew there was a reason
I skipped college.

616
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,022
If I hadn't taken Matsutani's class,

617
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,869
I'd never know how bad things really are.
My gross assets, my true debit flow,

618
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,700
my value index.

619
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:26,375
Well, if you need a job that'll hold
you over there, Kemo Sabe, just ask.

620
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,916
You can still work a line, can't you?

621
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,339
Yeah, I think so.

622
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:33,915
All right, just work it out with Raul.

623
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,886
He's tough, but fair.

624
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,467
I'm the boss of this kitchen. You know why?

625
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,257
- Because I'm tough, but I'm fair.
- Tough but fair.

626
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,885
You say you wanna work for me? Okay.

627
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:45,386
If you can use me.

628
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,221
Can I use you?

629
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,939
Hey, Nick, how many jobs you got?

630
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,813
Three, and I coach Little League.

631
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,439
<i>En América, tres, en México, tres,
en Panamá, uno.</i>

632
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,655
How long has it been
since you manned a kitchen, anyway?

633
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,778
It's been a few years.

634
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,494
Bang this bad boy out, then we'll see.

635
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,471
Order up!

636
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,799
- Here they are.
- Okay.

637
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,302
You're gonna be on-call.
You don't like it, walk.

638
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,805
I need to stay in school.

639
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,305
You can stay in a convent for all I care.

640
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:32,275
- Just be on time and don't steal the flatware.
- Deal.

641
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,314
- I'm a good boss, right?
- Great boss!

642
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,395
Tough, but fair.

643
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:38,277
Thank you.

644
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,107
This may be beyond comprehension,

645
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,987
<i>but there are many people
who dismiss Deep Space Nine</i>

646
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,698
<i>in favour of the original
or The Next Generation.</i>

647
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,116
Although I, too, am a fan
of both of Roddenberry's visions,

648
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,711
<i>there is no version of Star
Trek I do not enjoy.</i>

649
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,130
None.

650
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,831
As you can tell by my uniform,

651
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:59,176
had I the chance to
attend Starfleet Academy,

652
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,628
I would have studied the Life Sciences.

653
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:03,131
Who's cutting my class?
Where is Larry Crowne?

654
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,765
Maybe he got the flu.

655
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,395
Mr Mack, I apologise.

656
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,818
<i>Please continue on with Star Wars.</i>

657
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,021
In the deep space.

658
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,649
<i>I can't even begin to tell you the
difference between Star Trek</i>

659
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,994
<i>and Lucas' Star Wars saga. It's...</i>

660
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:29,999
Live long and prosper.

661
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,243
Energise.

662
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:47,767
Bankruptcy. An economy
cannot be free without bankruptcy.

663
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:52,397
Its penalties are obvious,
but what are its rewards?

664
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,145
I am so sorry I'm late.

665
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:59,352
Dr Matsutani, can I still sit in?

666
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,196
This is college, Mr Crowne.

667
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,570
There are only two things you can't do,

668
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,401
smoke in the building

669
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,700
and use your phone in my class.

670
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,165
Thank you.

671
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,702
The advantage of a bankruptcy works
both ways? How?

672
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:20,209
You're here? You have some nerve showing
your face after you've skipped my class.

673
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,460
Miss Tainot. A pleasure to see you.

674
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,342
Dr M. Oh, did he skip your class, also?

675
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,881
In fact, he was tardy.

676
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,427
- Miss Tainot, this will never happen again.
- It will never happen again.

677
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,056
And the next class, you will be first up
for Pop Topics.

678
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,941
Two minutes, Pop Topics, first up.

679
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,459
Interior design.

680
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,548
Workplace etiquette.

681
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,766
Good one.

682
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,944
I hope they're worth it!

683
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,065
- No, no, no, seriously, they're amazing!
- All right.

684
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,733
Come on.

685
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,871
I don't believe this.

686
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,788
Sharing sweets with a little dolly.

687
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,454
I bet that's why he went to college.

688
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,958
Find a gal who has a thing for papa bear.

689
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,836
And hideous pink doughnuts.

690
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,713
Oh!

691
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,390
Isn't that adorable?

692
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,477
Ooh! Who's this?

693
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,477
Wow, Larry! Nice job.

694
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,648
Hey, there, Project Runway! I choose you.

695
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:12,950
Hey, Johnny Cash. Where's your guitar?

696
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,500
Mr Crowne is first. Pick and speak.

697
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,842
Does this say "interior design"?

698
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,674
Let's say yes.

699
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,559
And go.

700
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,943
Interior design.

701
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:53,536
I know nothing
about interior design.

702
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:00,533
But I don't have to, because
I know this girl who does.

703
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,582
And the first time she came into my house

704
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,371
she starts rearranging everything I own.

705
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:11,220
She starts throwing out, you know, junk,
and rearranging my things

706
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,922
and moving my furniture to places
that it's never, ever been before.

707
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:20,020
And, before I know it,
I have a Spartan interior design

708
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,016
with traffic flow and feng shui,

709
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,401
in which everything has to be set just so,

710
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,322
otherwise the chi or the spirit of
the house doesn't move.

711
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,491
Then she moves from my living room
into my bedroom

712
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,785
and that place is a horror show.

713
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,111
My closet is a disaster.

714
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,490
I have too many of the
wrong kind of hangers

715
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:44,077
and I don't have enough scarves
to match my ensemble.

716
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:47,298
And my dresser drawers are pitiful.
And she's throwing out...

717
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:49,842
Oh, I can't wear matching pyjamas

718
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,293
only pyjama bottoms and a T-shirt.

719
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,218
Then she hops on my bed, and it's too hard!

720
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,434
Who lives here? The Flintstones?
Ow, Bamm-Bamm, you hurt my neck.

721
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,815
Then she threw out every one of my shirts.
Polo shirts are now forbidden.

722
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,439
Can anyone
remember anything from that?

723
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,776
Feng shui actually works.
I read about it in my Asian Studies class.

724
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,277
Something about the Flintstones.

725
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:15,608
Uh, Larry likes chicks
to rearrange his junk.

726
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,112
That's what we women do.
We take you men and we make you better.

727
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,948
We're moving off the topic.
Thank you, Mr Crowne.

728
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,624
Chester, you're up.

729
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,847
Finally, get rid of these.

730
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:24,220
I get Dell to do the remodel and can restock
everything I move in the wink of an eye.

731
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,273
Well, is...

732
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,683
Nice, thank you.
Is this your plus-minus delta number?

733
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,359
But that's what I'm asking you.
Square footage this cheap is a steal, right?

734
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,610
Low overhead, cheap labour.
You will be in proht. Yeah, there.

735
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,619
- I love you, Lance Corona!
- Well...

736
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,371
Hey, Dell.

737
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,091
I was just going back to work.

738
00:54:56,502 --> 00:55:00,803
I'm working my ass off all night just to
get one little f ricking smile out of you.

739
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:04,977
- I'm smiling.
- Oh, yeah, like the Joker after three martinis.

740
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,427
If they help, they help.

741
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,647
You can't even have a date night now.

742
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,565
You can't even chilloot for one minute!

743
00:55:10,566 --> 00:55:13,902
"Chilloot"? Did you just use
the word "chilloot"?

744
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,151
Did that come
from a Canadian blogger thesaurus?

745
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,404
Come on, let's just go home.
Get in the car.

746
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:28,407
Could you please just hold on
to the cheesecake

747
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,752
- so it doesn't slide back and forth?
- I'm allergic to cheesecake.

748
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,671
- Is that too much to ask?
- Have you forgotten?

749
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,747
Oh, my God. What, are you...

750
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:38,173
Are you looking for a whole different
kind of man? Mercedes? Is that it?

751
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,961
Sure.

752
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:42,797
I got news for you, I like myself, okay?

753
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,928
You know, I put up with you,
and I complain about nothing!

754
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:50,185
I am not complaining. I am stating.

755
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:53,859
I work and you porn-surf and pretend to work.
It's a statement.

756
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,778
That's so much bull right there, okay?

757
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:00,320
I had four postings today alone.

758
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:04,318
Fogcaster, Skyscan, Parsec12.com.

759
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,198
They're not postings, they're comments.

760
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,117
Comments! Like, "You're lame" is a comment.

761
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,372
And who are you to judge me, Boozilla?

762
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:18,801
You know, I know what
really pisses you off.

763
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,885
What is really pissing you off

764
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:25,307
is that I like big knockers
and you don't have any!

765
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,764
Maybe I should take that back.

766
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,517
Stop this car.

767
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,275
Stop this car.

768
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,365
- I said I would take it back.
- Stop the car.

769
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,659
Oh, come on, it was a joke!

770
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,237
Let me out of this fucking car!

771
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,414
- Give me that cheesecake.
- No, I take it back.

772
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,832
- I take it back.
- How about you just drive?

773
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,581
Look, I'm letting you win!

774
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,994
Drive to a cliff on the coastline, mister!

775
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,965
- So, everything that you say is right!
- You loser!

776
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:02,837
I married a loser!
A childish, blogging loser!

777
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,973
Okay, you know what?
Screw you, you washboard!

778
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,600
Go! Oh, chilloot!

779
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,427
I like big knockers!

780
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,037
Hey, Lance! Chick alert!

781
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,708
You are not gonna believe
how fate meets cute.

782
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,541
Well, come on!

783
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,846
Look who's
waiting for a bus! Miss Tainot?

784
00:57:54,513 --> 00:57:56,481
Do you need a ride? Hop on.

785
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,644
Bust up your dance in the dell with Bambi?
No, thanks.

786
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,276
Hey! Bambi was a boy.

787
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,942
- Hey, can you spare your spare?
- Sure.

788
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,202
Thank you.

789
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:15,246
- Where did you go?
- Just hooking Lance up, sweetie.

790
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,286
A man on a scooter can accomplish
anything, Lance.

791
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:26,429
What do men see in irritating free spirits?

792
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,848
Seriously, I am offering you a ride.

793
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,764
Seriously, I can walk.

794
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,100
In those shoes?

795
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,902
You noticed my shoes?

796
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,780
Fine, I'll ride, but I will not wear
that bucket on my head.

797
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,115
It's the law.

798
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,791
We're going so slow a cat could
knock us over, you know that, right?

799
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,842
I've never given anyone a ride before!
I wanna make sure we both survive!

800
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,309
Pardon me?

801
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,394
I said "ha, ha, ha".

802
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,347
Oh, look at this!

803
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,807
Somebody is getting pinched.

804
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,609
- Put your hands behind your back, sir.
- No, you gotta be kidding me!

805
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,237
Ooh, this looks like a DUl.
This guy's in trouble.

806
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,531
- No!
- You have the right to an attorney.

807
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,234
- Shut up, shut up! I know my rights!
- You understand that?

808
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,869
- I know my rights!
- All right.

809
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,742
- Here we go now.
- Hey!

810
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,415
- Careful with that man's cheesecake, Officer!
- Now, watch your head.

811
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,366
He's very sensitive about his cheesecake!

812
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,914
Did you
know what you just did?

813
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,996
I bet you 10 bucks
that he barfs in the backseat.

814
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,002
It was a bad night for that guy.

815
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,507
Drive on, Macduff!

816
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,719
There it is!

817
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,472
On the left, got it.

818
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,483
On the left!

819
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,528
You're following me.

820
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:18,874
I'm just... I'm seeing you safely
to your door, that's all.

821
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,958
Okay. Um...

822
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:25,037
Oh, my purse. Do you have my...

823
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,257
Oh, it's in the car. The car.

824
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:35,341
There's a key buried in that plant.

825
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:38,514
Whoo!

826
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,228
This it?

827
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,890
That is it.

828
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,401
There appears to be some choices.

829
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,937
Uh...

830
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:51,656
Let's see.

831
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,617
Let me get this for you.

832
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,409
Ooh!

833
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:04,503
I have 30 seconds to disarm the alarm
or the cops will be here in half an hour.

834
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,754
- They're slow.
- Slow cops.

835
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,467
Oh. Better get to it. Look away, please.

836
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,685
Two,

837
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,606
two,

838
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,813
two,

839
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,646
two.

840
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,105
Pound.

841
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,528
Gotcha.

842
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,743
All right!

843
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,030
Mission accomplished, Mr Man in the Black.

844
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,376
- Good night, Miss Tainot.
- Missus.

845
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,877
I'm Mrs Tainot.

846
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,878
Can't you see that?

847
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,959
I assumed you preferred Miss.

848
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,718
Well, when you presume, you make
a pretty pair of asses out of me and you.

849
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,764
Something like that, or...

850
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,931
Do you know what I noticed on the ride?

851
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,938
That you smell very pleasant.

852
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,314
Well, thank you.

853
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,408
Would you...

854
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,951
Would you like to kiss me?

855
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:23,995
Just if you... if you wanted to kiss me,
it would really

856
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:28,124
be your lucky night,
because I'm half in the bag

857
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:31,044
and my husband won't be home for,
you know,

858
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:34,001
three to five years.

859
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,697
Mmm-hmm! Mmm!

860
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,585
Wow!

861
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,046
Whoa! Did you feel that?

862
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,714
Oh, this is crazy.

863
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:23,846
Let's do that again, and this time,
permission to cop a feel.

864
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,598
Uh, wait, okay, okay. Miss Tainot...

865
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,428
Mrs Tainot, Mrs Tainot...

866
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,227
Oh, please, it was... Wow!

867
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:34,904
Mrs Tainot, it is now time
for both of us to do the right thing.

868
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,153
- In you go.
- What?

869
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,112
Are you kidding?
But I thought I smelled good, too.

870
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:43,407
- Closing the door.
- How could you... Really? Really?

871
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,074
Lock the door.

872
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,812
I can see you, you know.

873
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,772
Good night, Mrs Tainot.

874
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:45,219
- All right, buddy, get out.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Just keep it.

875
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:48,768
- Oh, wow, great, thanks.
- It'll put my kid through college.

876
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:52,097
Oh, my God.

877
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,528
Aw, come on! Jerk!

878
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,614
Oh, God, I need coffee.

879
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,747
<i>I'm your dirty girl, bad boy.</i>

880
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:15,795
<i>I'm your dirty girl, bad boy.</i>

881
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,997
<i>I'm your dirty girl, bad boy.</i>

882
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,171
Jesus, hell, and tomorrow.

883
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,964
Mercy!

884
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,223
Oh, shit.

885
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,728
Fortune cookies!
Chinese food tells you the future!

886
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,017
Sushi is fresh out of the sea.
Tempura is fresh out of the oil.

887
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,816
Accent on fr-fr-fresh!

888
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:45,190
But it won't keep overnight
like Kung Pao chicken.

889
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,614
Those flavours the next day
are deep and delicious.

890
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,533
Samurais are amazing chefs!

891
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,285
I weigh, like, 90 pounds.

892
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,074
What's my 2:00 a. m. meal
after a couple of puffs?

893
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:58,797
Chinese food in the Chinese carton
with Chinese chopsticks!

894
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,716
- Yeah, yeah!
- What about the MSG?

895
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,170
That's enough of the fake debate for today.
Thank you for your passion.

896
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,929
That was so fun!

897
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,425
Mr Crowne?

898
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,977
A moment, please.

899
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,267
- Sure.
- Uh-oh!

900
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,693
Sounds like you're in trouble.

901
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:37,958
Last night was a confluence
of too many things happening

902
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:40,004
in too short of a time span.

903
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,080
Yeah.

904
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:47,963
I believe there was an inappropriate
exchange between teacher and student.

905
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:55,429
I was worked up and under the influence
of the demon rum.

906
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:01,276
Reminded me of a spotty incident

907
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,109
I once had with a parking lot attendant,

908
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,283
which was...

909
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:16,161
At any rate, I hope the entire thing

910
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,369
can be forgiven and forgotten.

911
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,204
If gossip of this nature were to circulate,

912
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,128
it would be not only embarrassing,

913
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:29,008
but my status as a professor could
be tarnished.

914
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,591
Well, I wouldn't want that.

915
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,305
So, no bragging to your pals about

916
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,268
almost scoring with the drunken professor.

917
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,819
Well, I should scurry along.

918
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:52,986
Hope I don't have the same conversation
with Dr Matsutani.

919
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,518
The papers and records
for 8656 Derby Court.

920
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:30,355
Since River Creek Bank can't see
to give me new terms,

921
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:34,901
my mortgage has become a bad debt
that I now transfer back to you.

922
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:38,122
Oh. No, no, no.
You don't wanna default on this.

923
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,575
It's called a strategic foreclosure.

924
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,081
Oh, I know what it's called,
but you can't do this.

925
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:45,412
See, it's bad for your credit.

926
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:49,259
Any student of Economics 1 will tell you
this move is tough, but fair.

927
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:54,222
Larry, let's go have ourselves some
complimentary coffee

928
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:55,640
and we'll talk this out.

929
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:59,765
Legally, I have to vacate the premises
in 30 days. Keys are in it.

930
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:05,067
This is not personal, Mrs Gammelgaard.
It's just, well, times have changed.

931
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,323
Oh, shoot!

932
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,067
When we bought this house,

933
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:18,072
I thought I'd see my kids grow up
on this street.

934
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,073
Man, you're whining
like a goo-goo, ga-ga baby,

935
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:24,910
when you got your health,
you got no family to support.

936
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:28,461
You're pale in America.
You're a clean slate.

937
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,583
You're starting over.

938
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,712
I just hate to leave.

939
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,516
Well, manifest destiny is taking you
someplace else, neighbour.

940
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:43,521
You took the time to meditate
on the vagaries of life,

941
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,849
You'd come to realise

942
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:51,812
that a woman with a measuring tape

943
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,690
is money in my pocket.

944
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,982
How you ladies doing?

945
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,862
Oh, this is a nice one right here.
An old football table.

946
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,617
David Beckham actually owned this one.

947
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:03,492
Now, I got a offer for 1,800.
You just gotta beat that.

948
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,498
<i>Showers should clear
before the morning commute.</i>

949
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:14,673
<i>Look for sunny skies by 9:00 a. m.
with temperatures in the mid-70s.</i>

950
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,812
These topics are to be researched

951
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,909
until you can wax poetic on them
for two minutes.

952
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:39,526
- What'd you get?
- Potatoes.

953
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:41,361
Spuds. Can't wait.

954
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:44,457
No repetition, no pauses.

955
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,787
"Disraeli"? What is that?

956
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,705
"Who" is that.

957
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:54,209
Guy from Disrael. I'm done!

958
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,384
No notes, no visual aids,
just sacks of charm.

959
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,140
"Geography Show"?

960
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,259
- That says "George Bernard Shaw".
- No, it doesn't.

961
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,265
Well, the handwriting's kind of loopy.

962
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,181
Then "Geography Show" for two minutes.

963
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,519
- Pasta!
- Great.

964
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,604
Good luck, everybody. This is your final.

965
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,398
You're dismissed.

966
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:28,209
Have a good day.

967
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,293
Oh, thanks.

968
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,759
Let me get this straight.

969
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:44,758
You think dropping my class to open
a thrift store is a good idea.

970
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,227
Not by much.

971
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,064
Mercy? Mercy, come and meet this girl.

972
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:53,481
She brings passion
to Feminism and Modern Lit.

973
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,403
We should all be a witness.
And she's leaving me.

974
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,531
We've met.

975
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,449
That was some night, huh?

976
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,869
I'm sure you and Larry Crowne have
your pillow talk.

977
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,743
Pillow talk?

978
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:11,628
Lance is a sweetie,
but I think he was born in the 1950s.

979
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:17,338
Lance is forever mute on the subject of you.
Can't get a peep out of him.

980
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:26,476
Lance? Larry Crowne? Who?

981
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:29,430
- One and the same.
- He works at Frank's Coffee Shop.

982
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,973
- The pie place?
- Great French toast.

983
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:36,601
At the end of each chapter
is a study guide.

984
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:40,105
Master those and you will have mastered
the course pack.

985
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,608
Where's Talia?

986
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,735
Where's Talia?

987
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:48,039
Master my course pack
and you will take over the world.

988
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,127
By now, you should be laughing with me.

989
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,983
- Hey, there's Lance.
- Oh, yeah.

990
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,744
What a surprise.

991
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:30,289
Somebody skipped Matsutani's class!

992
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,742
I dropped out of college today.

993
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,252
What?

994
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,080
No, Talia, don't be a fool, stay in school.

995
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:40,588
And don't drink and drive, or do drugs,
and quit smoking, and eat vegetables.

996
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:43,386
I don't, I stopped, I did, I do.

997
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,884
New watch for you.

998
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,636
Hey, we all got free tattoos.

999
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:50,184
I wanted something in Japanese,
so check this out.

1000
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,146
That one says "courage".
That one says “spirit".

1001
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,436
Courageous spirit.

1002
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,519
I can see you!

1003
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,864
This is glass! I can see through glass!

1004
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:09,036
You know, that's Chinese, and it says

1005
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:12,697
- soy sauce.
- Oh, shut up!

1006
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,917
It does. Soy sauce!

1007
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,870
Be here for our grand opening.

1008
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:21,675
Oh, I might not make it.
Some of us have finals.

1009
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,370
Hi, Larry!

1010
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,975
- Mack.
- Yeah?

1011
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,889
- Got room for one more?
- I can try.

1012
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,440
Thanks.

1013
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,354
No room for your furniture?

1014
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,399
Well, it's a tiny place.

1015
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,979
How much you think you're gonna get
for this sofa sleeper?

1016
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,153
I don't know. You'll get me a good price.

1017
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,151
You're a smart man, Larry Crowne.

1018
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,825
Pizza's here at last!

1019
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,244
Here's that lunch I promised you.

1020
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,834
Did they tell you that I had one of
these discount coupons?

1021
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:31,846
Son of a cock.

1022
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,264
Larry Crowne.

1023
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,050
Jack Strang.

1024
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:41,348
Two extra large, a salad bucket
and a box of cinnamon frosted eggs. $16.50.

1025
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:47,521
Sorry to say this, but I need 2 bucks back.
Times are tough.

1026
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,364
Tell me about it.

1027
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,363
You know what, forget it.

1028
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,115
- Keep the change. Yeah.
- Really? Yeah?

1029
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:59,290
Hey, thanks, Crowne. I appreciate it.
Every buck helps.

1030
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,083
Put that right there.

1031
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:03,203
Lamar, don't touch the cinnamon eggs.

1032
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,083
I'm not gonna touch
the cinnamon eggs, baby.

1033
01:17:05,084 --> 01:17:06,752
I don't want a cinnamon egg.

1034
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,601
- I'm gonna miss him. You, too.
- Yeah.

1035
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,430
- Oh, Larry.
- You're the best.

1036
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,890
Come back and see us.

1037
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:28,235
Larry, I got something for you.

1038
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,563
Good luck.

1039
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,067
- Well, I appreciate it, Lamar.
- If you win, I get half.

1040
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,109
Quick Picks. You never know.

1041
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,612
Bye, Larry!

1042
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,075
I'm gonna miss him.

1043
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,251
- See you, Larry!
- Goodbye, Larry!

1044
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,303
There is not a woman in the world

1045
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:39,598
that has not been standing
where you are right now.

1046
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,559
So, let's get it on. Come on!
Come on, let's go.

1047
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:54,730
There you go, there you go.
Yeah, baby, come on.

1048
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,241
Come on, come on.

1049
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,322
- How much change do you want back?
- Why don't you keep it?

1050
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,533
But just remember,
a teacher once gave you a $12 tip.

1051
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:09,707
- You stay in school.
- Thank you.

1052
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,336
You're a babe. Where do you teach?

1053
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,551
I'm divorcing a professor turned writer
turned blogger

1054
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:17,511
with the libido of a 13-year-old

1055
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,385
with two published books to his credit.

1056
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,596
When a man shows his true colours,

1057
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:27,397
that's when a woman has to make
the decision to go or no go.

1058
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,233
And we got pizza to go.

1059
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,675
Good morning, Larry.

1060
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,965
Good morning.

1061
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,638
Should I have been calling you Lance
all this time?

1062
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:05,385
Oh, no. Only one person calls me Lance.

1063
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,260
Well, and all her friends.

1064
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:10,105
I met her. She's an interesting girl.

1065
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,563
She's a unique bundle, yeah.

1066
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,937
And all this, you know,
my clothes are her idea.

1067
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:19,399
I had actually put that together.

1068
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,491
You ready for your final?

1069
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,109
Well, you'll find out.

1070
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,078
I drew
the order last night.

1071
01:20:25,079 --> 01:20:26,738
- And?
- You're last.

1072
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,161
Lucky me.

1073
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,993
- Thank you, by the way.
- What did I do?

1074
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,080
- Kept our secret.
- Oh.

1075
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,958
I don't do many things well,
but I can keep a secret.

1076
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:38,755
Gentlemen do.

1077
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,629
Allow me.

1078
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,256
Morning!

1079
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:48,136
- Good morning!
- Let's make a few changes.

1080
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,637
A box of biscuits, a bag of biscuits,
a biscuit mixer! Say it!

1081
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,812
A box of biscuits, a
bag of biscuits, a biscuit mixer!

1082
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,269
Mr Mack, get loose.

1083
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:59,276
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

1084
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,191
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

1085
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:05,536
And we're moving, we're moving!
This is like Tainot-palooza! Breathing.

1086
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:08,455
Giving birth to relaxation.

1087
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:12,283
Pasta comes in all shapes and sizes.

1088
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:15,879
Farfalle, otherwise known as butterfly
or bow-tie shaped pasta...

1089
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,715
Because Australia's been an island
since the beginning of time,

1090
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,920
some awfully goofy animals can be
found there. Kangaroos, of course...

1091
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,842
If you're on the Moon
and look down at Earth

1092
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,340
you could actually see and recognise
the Great Lakes.

1093
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,472
They comprise 20% of the world's
fresh surface water supply.

1094
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,804
Aurora borealis can be found
in the northern hemisphere

1095
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,305
in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia.

1096
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,728
<i>- Everybody loves potatoes.
- How about that?</i>

1097
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,895
French fries, baked potato, potato chips,
scalloped potatoes...

1098
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:43,481
If it was the romance novelist in him
that made Victoria, the Queen, such a pal,

1099
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:47,485
chalk it up as another brick
in the legacy of Ben Disraeli,

1100
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:50,655
Earl of Beaconsield,

1101
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,657
educator,

1102
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:55,457
and Prime Minister of Great Britain!

1103
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,165
Yeah!

1104
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,801
Boom.

1105
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,336
Dibiasi, that was great.

1106
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,347
That leaves only Mr Crowne
and George Bernard Shaw.

1107
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:14,938
Uh, that's "Geography Show", remember?

1108
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,858
Right, the study of the Earth.

1109
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,570
Yes, study of the Earth, and there goes
my opening remark.

1110
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,566
Thank you.

1111
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,617
The equator

1112
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:31,948
is that imaginary line
that separates the Earth

1113
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,031
into the northern
and the southern hemisphere.

1114
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,002
And when you cross it for the first time

1115
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:39,796
it's a very big deal if
you are in the Navy,

1116
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:42,295
even if you're a culinary specialist.

1117
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,758
The old guys make you dress up
in goofy costumes

1118
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:48,880
and you have to sing these bawdy songs.

1119
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,430
And they play practical jokes on you.

1120
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:54,136
When I did it for the
first time, years ago,

1121
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:57,564
a chief petty officer ordered me
to stand watch

1122
01:22:57,639 --> 01:23:00,108
until I saw the equator as we passed it,

1123
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:01,982
and I would recognize it by the big posts

1124
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:06,110
that were sunk into the ocean floor
and spaced every 100 yards.

1125
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,785
And, obviously, I never
hit my rack that night.

1126
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:13,155
Remember the old commercial for the Navy?

1127
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:15,406
"Join the Navy, see the world"?

1128
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,580
Well, it's true. I did.

1129
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:22,916
I saw landmarks that were both manmade
and the natural things.

1130
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,421
I saw deltas, I saw mountain ranges.

1131
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,794
I saw the Rock of Gibraltar.
I saw Hong Kong.

1132
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:31,589
And I saw the southern sky,

1133
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:34,469
which has different stars
than the northern sky does.

1134
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,184
In the Navy,
I went around the world five times.

1135
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:40,186
I saw the aurora borealis.

1136
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,857
I had shore leave in Australia,

1137
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:45,858
couple of times. Quite memorable.

1138
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:49,613
And I saw the Great Lakes from the rail
of a missile frigate

1139
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:51,110
while I was on the Great Lakes.

1140
01:23:51,111 --> 01:23:56,331
I boiled and peeled and mashed and hashed
an awful lot of potatoes.

1141
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,956
I saw pasta once a week.

1142
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:03,622
Spaghetti Wednesdays, when I was in
charge of the galley.

1143
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:06,123
I learned a lot of geography in the Navy

1144
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:10,300
but I would never be able to
communicate it to you

1145
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,348
with such ease

1146
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:17,724
unless I had taken a class like this.

1147
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:24,769
I believe it was George Bernard Shaw
who once quipped,

1148
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:30,484
"A fool's brain digests
philosophy into folly,

1149
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,611
science into superstition

1150
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,868
and art into pedantry.

1151
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:40,668
Hence a university education. "

1152
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:46,174
Sounds to me like George Bernard Shaw
must have taken a college class

1153
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:52,134
maybe even Speech 217,
the Art of Informal Remarks.

1154
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,261
Ding-ding! Applause, please!

1155
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:03,523
Yeah!

1156
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:09,522
- Larry!
- Be aggressive, Larry!

1157
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,283
Larry
Crowne, you're terrific!

1158
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,326
Oh, that was incredible.

1159
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,331
Best speech ever!

1160
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,851
The first to finish. No surprise.

1161
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,479
Mr Crowne,

1162
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:54,988
you have a grasp of my concepts
like few others.

1163
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,908
Thank you, Doctor.

1164
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,447
Hmm.

1165
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:42,618
Cottage cheese to keep
me trim, fruit to keep me regular,

1166
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,792
and a big-ass biscuit.

1167
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,837
Club sandwich, white toast,
order of French fry, chicken-fried steak.

1168
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,381
That's right, chicken-fried.
Big-time, Larry.

1169
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,974
Spectacular.

1170
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,721
Hey, Nick.

1171
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,849
- Take the wheel for a second.
- All right.

1172
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,813
Is this the place with the killer pie?

1173
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,482
What's Spanish for
"My next wife just walked in"?

1174
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:20,987
Hello, I'm Larry, and I will be
your culinary specialist today.

1175
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:25,077
Larry Crowne, look at you. You work here?

1176
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:26,830
- It's my secret identity.
- Right.

1177
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,203
Frances, this is the A student
I was telling you about.

1178
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,047
The one that smells so nice.

1179
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,125
Larry, um,

1180
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:40,514
I actually gave you an
A-plus in Speech 217.

1181
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:43,340
"A" for excellent. Lance!

1182
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,059
A-plus?

1183
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:48,012
Well, I don't know what
to say, Miss Tainot.

1184
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:51,056
Please call me Mercy.
I'm not your teacher any more.

1185
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,684
Boo-hoo.

1186
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,611
Unless you signed up for next term.

1187
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:59,028
- Larry, kitchen, cook, busy.
- All right. My boss.

1188
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,277
Larry?

1189
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:05,364
You're a great student. I'm not an easy A.

1190
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,789
You're a great teacher.

1191
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:16,759
I got a whiff of the chef.
He smelled like grilled onions.

1192
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,565
Hey, thanks, Nick.

1193
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,739
Okay, I got this.
Greek salad, spaghetti, meatballs.

1194
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:59,339
The ships of finance
sail upon roiling seas,

1195
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:02,429
with hidden shoals of junk debt,

1196
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:05,923
squalls of undercapitalisation

1197
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:09,849
and tsunamis of the false value index.

1198
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:15,435
This course pack, written by guess who,

1199
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:20,109
is your map to a safe economic harbour.

1200
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,653
All aboard!

1201
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:36,954
The state charter requires a minimum of
10 students per class

1202
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:41,458
and since there are only eight of you,

1203
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,836
it costs them more...

1204
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,966
- Sorry we're late!
- Doesn't mean we don't care.

1205
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,179
Where's Larry?

1206
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,685
- Yeah, where is Larry?
- Crowne stiffed us?

1207
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,182
I thought for sure he'd be here.

1208
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,811
He told me your class changed his life.

1209
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,232
What's the name of this class, anyway?

1210
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:06,530
Shakespeare, the Politician.

1211
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,287
Seriously?

1212
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,376
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Miss Tainot.

1213
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,875
T-A-I-N-O-T.

1214
01:30:17,954 --> 01:30:21,629
- Not Tae-Bo, not Tai Chi.
- Thanks a lot, guys.

1215
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,720
Not Tie-knot. Not Snotface.

1216
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:02,211
<i>Right
turn Harbor Street.</i>

1217
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,551
<i>- Thank you.
- Right turn.</i>

1218
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:06,210
Turning right.

1219
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:08,712
<i>Your destination is on the right.</i>

1220
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,136
Oh. Okay.

1221
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,389
Well, thank you, Map Genie.

1222
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:40,128
I love that dress, Cha-Cha!

1223
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:41,580
But I'd show more leg if I were you.

1224
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,092
4225?

1225
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:49,387
You're looking for Lance.

1226
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,599
4225.

1227
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,051
You'll see the stairs.

1228
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:55,727
Thank you.

1229
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:00,770
Shorter dress'll get you wolf whistles!

1230
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,275
Ow! For you. For you.

1231
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,358
- So, did he close that deal?
- Almost.

1232
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:12,194
Lance, Lance, Lance.

1233
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,089
Hello.

1234
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,221
Mercy.

1235
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:41,894
That's a good trick.

1236
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:55,153
You told Lala my class changed your life.

1237
01:32:56,863 --> 01:32:59,161
Yes, yes, I said that.

1238
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:05,588
I met you.

1239
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:43,368
So, are you hungry?

1240
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,500
Extremely.

1241
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:51,381
Let me show you the
world's smallest kitchen.

1242
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,222
It's where I make my French toast.
