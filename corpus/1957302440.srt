It's called fun, Cindy Berman.
You used to have it, remember?

685
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:16,791
- [Alice] We're gonna find you, Sarah Fier!
- Tommy! [echoing]

686
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,208
[whispering voice] <i>Tommy…</i>

687
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,458
[Cindy] Tommy!

688
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,541
Come on, they took everything!

691
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,916
Go away, Cindy!

692
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,875
It's me. It's Nick.

693
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,875
Go away, Nick!

694
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,541
Whoa.

695
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,833
- I like what you've done with the place.
- This wasn't me.

696
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:48,916
[Nick] I'm shocked.

697
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,583
"Ziggy is a witch bitch."

698
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,875
"Ziggy sucks cocks in Hell." Jeez.

00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,708
Colonel Mustard.

701
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,250
- Oh, looks like blood.
- Yeah. I didn't have a pig, so…

702
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,458
<i>Carrie.</i> Cool.

703
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,375
You've read <i>Carrie?</i>

704
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,916
Yeah. Second favorite after <i>Salem's Lot.</i>

00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,625
[Ziggy chuckles]

706
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,833
Still, I dunno,
paint seems a little pedestrian.

707
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a better idea?

708
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,416
Maybe.

709
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,875
Shouldn't you be, like,
turning me in or something?

710
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:26,541
Well, I should be supervising
Color War, uh…

711
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,333
- But noticed you were MIA and...
- So you decided to stalk me.

712
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,166
Check in on you.

713
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,208
Clearly you don't need my assistance.
All good. Go ahead.

714
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,375
"Carrie" on.

715
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,875

Alice!

720
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,000
Come on, it's disgusting in here!

721
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,791
[Alice] We're close,
Berman, hang in there!

722
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,125
This was the best idea.

723
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:06,166
Yeah, but I still don't feel shit.

724
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,708
OK, so, take more.

725
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:10,416
Thank you.

726
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,083

Shit!

731
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,000
- Oh, it's ruined now!
- You cursed again.

732
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,833
You want me to murder you?

00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,958
- Babe, you OK?
- [Tommy] Yeah.

734
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,875
Yeah, I'm fine. [sniffs]

735
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,083
[Alice screams]

736
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,000
[Cindy] Alice?

[suspenseful music playing]

738
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,666
Watch your step.

739
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,833
[Tommy] Is someone digging a grave?

740
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,375
[Alice] Graves.

741
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,375
Mary.

742
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,875
Hey, where's the, uh…

743
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,500
The X's, look. Look.

744
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,583
Look, here. Here.

745
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,166
She was marking where she dug.

746
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,791
[Alice] "But without her hand,

747
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,166
her grip on the land holds firm

748
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,041
and the curse will last
until body and hand unite."

749
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,708
Maybe Mary was looking for the hand.

750
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,958
- To end the curse?
- That made her daughter lose her mind.

751
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,083
Guys, come on.

752
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,125
- [scoffs] This is silly.
- [Arnie] Yeah.

753
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,083
I gotta piss.

754
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,791
Hey, let me see that.

755
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,250
You can have it,

756
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,916
but first give me the drugs.

758
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:50,666

00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,291

[menacing music playing]

762
00:38:56,833 --> 00:39:00,750
If Nurse Mary took them and went crazy,
those drugs are very dangerous.

00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,708
[laughing] Oh my God!

764
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,291
What happened to you?

765
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,291
You remember when we used to have fun?

766
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,916
- Before you became a snitch?
- Just let it go already.

767
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,375
That's easy for you to say.

768
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:15,791
- You lying fucking Brutus.
- [Arnie] I found it!

769
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,000
I found the witch's house.

- [Alice and Arnie laughing]

771
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,333
Dude…

772
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:30,083
Was I the only one expecting, like,
I dunno, a house made out of candy?

773
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,686
[Arnie] Maybe there's candy down here.

00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,083
Hey, Sarah,
you got any candy down there? [laughing]

779
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,333
We're high and hungry.

780
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,041
- Sarah Fier!
- OK, we've seen enough.

781
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,958
Alright then, go home, Berman.

782
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,166
I didn't march all the way out here
for nothing, OK?

783
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,166
- [Alice laughing]
- Are you crazy? Alice!

00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,458
Alice!

785
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,208
[Alice] Hey, someone's been down here.

786
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,333
Like, recently.

It's Sarah Fier!

790
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,750
Sarah Fier isn't real.

791
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,708
Well, someone lit that candle.

792
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,000
Hey, Sarah Fier, if you're in here,
say something!

793
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,583
Maybe she's shy.

794
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,208
[Alice chuckles]

795
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,166

Whoa!

799
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,750
It's some kind of, like, occult thing…

800
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,833
Like Devil worship.

801
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,958
- [Alice] It's kinky.
- [Arnie] Oh, yeah.

802
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,333
- [Alice laughing]
- It's the witch's mark.

803
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,250
The what?

804
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:29,375
[Cindy] "A deal was made with the Devil."

805
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:32,708
"Sarah Fier cut off her wicked hand
on Satan's stone

806
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,708
in exchange for eternal life,

scarring the soil beneath

00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,250
[Arnie] That's it.

810
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,125
It's acetaminophen.

811
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,875
- Arnie, what are you talking about?
- [Arnie] L484.

812
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:51,125
It just hit me. It's fucking Tylenol.
It's nothing.

813
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,375
Are you sure?

814
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:53,458
Positive.

815
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
[Arnie] Come on, Alice.
Let's get out of here.

816
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,833
Pretty sure Joan might still have
some weed if we pay her.

What, you think I carved your boyfriend's
name into solid stone with my fingernails?
