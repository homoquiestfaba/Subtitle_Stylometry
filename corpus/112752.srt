1
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,520
You want a drink?

2
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,526
I think we're out of beer.

3
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,668
- We out of beer?
- You're empty.

4
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,273
- I'll go get some.
- I'll go.

5
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:42,275
- No, I'll go. I don't care.
- No, I'll go. I could use the air.

6
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,721
<i>Jungle warrior!</i>

7
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,566
Wait.

8
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,961
What are we doing?

9
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,932
I don't know.

10
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,046
Should we stop this?

11
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,641
Stop what?

12
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,009
- Oh, my God.
- Should we stop?

13
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,944
- No.
- I don't ever wanna stop.

14
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:30,244
- I don't either.
- I'll meet you tomorrow at 12 at Shane's.

15
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,411
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

16
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:38,426
Okay.

17
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:44,695
- Bye, you guys.
- All right. Good night.

18
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,805
- Come here.
- What?

19
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,068
- Come here. Get in here.
- What? Terry?

20
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:56,006
What's the matter?

21
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,539
No more of this crap, all right?
From now on, we act like a married couple.

22
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,778
- No more flirting around. You understand?
- No. How could I?

23
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:08,117
Who can understand
such a flaming pile of bullshit?

24
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,749
Oh, Jack. Come on, don't play dumb.

25
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,725
- Please.
- Terry...

26
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:16,292
...why don't you have some wine.

27
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:18,866
We've been drinking gin.
I don't want wine.

28
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:22,971
Let's talk about this in the morning.
You're drunk and we're gonna fight.

29
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,403
And you have that look of yours.

30
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,600
Forget that look of mine.

31
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,479
Let's talk about you and Edith.

32
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,244
The little trips you take.

33
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,351
These damn errands.

34
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:41,014
Somebody runs out of something...

35
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,988
...some goddamn egg rolls, and off you go,
you and Edith.

36
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,718
Egg rolls? Really?

37
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:47,522
Egg rolls?

38
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,494
What are you talking about?

39
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,463
You know, you shouldn't
leave me with Hank...

40
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,331
...and put me in that position.
- What position?

41
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,864
- Jack, listen to me.
- What?

42
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,838
Something's going on.

43
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:03,240
I mean, either you want it to,
or it is.

44
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:07,440
That is such a lot of horseshit. Okay?

45
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,680
What is wrong with me and Edith going off
to get a goddamn six-pack of beer?

46
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,853
What are you really worried about?
It's you and Hank being left alone together.

47
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,825
- I see you two. You're horny for Hank.
- Oh, please.

48
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:24,660
- I'm supposed to feel guilty because of that?
- I'm horny for my husband.

49
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,463
Jesus. We're not a couple of fucking
honeymooners anymore, for chrissake.

50
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,869
Why aren't we?! We've been married
so long that you're bored?

51
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,668
- Terry.
- No. Is that what it is?

52
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,777
- You can leave anytime.
- Terry...

53
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,776
Maybe we should talk about...

54
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:40,040
...how long this is gonna last.
- Terry!

55
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:42,844
- I am not going anywhere!
- The kids'll be fine.

56
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,316
If you're suffering...

57
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,820
...if this is such a disappointment.
- You're the only wife I know...

58
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,892
...that gets pissed off at her husband
for not hanging on her at a party!

59
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:55,861
- Husbands touch their wives!
- You see Hank fondling Edith every second?

60
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:57,795
Hank doesn't love her.

61
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:00,798
He told me while you were out.

62
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,899
- He said that to you?
- Yeah.

63
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,568
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

64
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,177
Why? Why did he tell you that?

65
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,176
I don't know. He just said it.

66
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,339
What were you doing?
He just blurted that out? Seems odd.

67
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,413
We were talking.
How else do people tell each other things?

68
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,884
When people say things like that
they're doing other things.

69
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,185
Yeah, I was blowing him on the porch.

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,793
- What do you care?
- I don't.

71
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,487
- As long as you tell me the truth.
- The truth?

72
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,764
Jack, you won't even admit the truth.

73
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,201
- You don't really love me.
- Terry, it's not true.

74
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:44,108
It's never been true. And when you say shit
like that, for one minute it is the truth!

75
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,111
- Do you understand me?
- Fuck you!

76
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,539
Fuck you!

77
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,675
Goddamn it!

78
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,657
Fucker!

79
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,638
Bastard!

80
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,137
I'm trying to concentrate!

81
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,944
Give me back my paper!

82
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,749
Oh, shit.

83
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,410
Dad!

84
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,670
Stop it! You're making too much noise.

85
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,112
Oh, shit.

86
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,646
Mom!

87
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,115
Stop it!

88
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,376
Come back here!

89
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,382
Mom!

90
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,023
- Mom!
- What?!

91
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,710
Go to school.

92
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:58,972
It's summer. I don't have to.
You go to school.

93
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,013
It's Saturday. I don't have to.

94
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,917
So, what are you gonna do today?

95
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,152
Make up stories.

96
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,157
Why?

97
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,757
Make people laugh. Make people cry.

98
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,557
But why?

99
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,668
- Hey, have you seen my keys?
- Yeah. They're over here.

100
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:31,108
The sitter's coming over in a couple hours.
I'm gonna go out and do some things.

101
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,739
I'm gonna go run with Jack
after I finish writing.

102
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,179
- Okay.
- See you.

103
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,320
Hey. Hey.

104
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,059
Have a good day.

105
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,593
You too.

106
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:04,111
Hey.

107
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,747
Yeah?

108
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:09,984
- You want lunch or breakfast?
- What do you got?

109
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:14,555
Cereal if you want breakfast. If you want
lunch, I could get lobsters. For you and me.

110
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:19,218
- Kids don't like them anyway.
- I can't. I'm in a hurry. I'm taking the car in.

111
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,421
It'll just take half an hour.

112
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:24,594
I need the car there by 12.

113
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,668
- You have to?
- Lf I want the work done, yeah.

114
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,535
Well, what's the work?

115
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,238
Oil and a lube.

116
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,642
That doesn't take very long, so...

117
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:44,247
Terry, those guys got work to do,
and they want the car now or not at all.

118
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,914
They don't care if you want a lobster.
But if you do want one, get it before I go.

119
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,751
<i>You petulant son of a bitch, just make love
to your wife and have a fucking lobster.</i>

120
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:55,487
I don't want one by myself.

121
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:57,996
Why? You don't think it'd taste as good?

122
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,131
You know what I mean.

123
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:04,028
You want Cheerios or Grape-Nuts?

124
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,673
Grape-Nuts, please.

125
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,138
Dickhead.

126
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,083
Fuck.

127
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,389
Jesus Christ.

128
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:08,903
Sean. Sean.
Cease and desist, man.

129
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,904
- You slept late.
- Yeah. Because it's Saturday.

130
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,045
It's because you were up late.
You guys were fighting.

131
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,410
Oh, yeah? What did you hear?

132
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,381
Yelling and swear words. Then you left.

133
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:26,811
You know what, guys? Grownups fight.

134
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,980
Especially married ones.

135
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,728
- You want me to make something to eat?
- I could eat a horse.

136
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,264
I could eat a horse.

137
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,901
Give that to your brother.

138
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,901
If I promise not to get fat,
can I keep our baby?

139
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,779
Want dessert too?

140
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:55,712
- Do we even have any?
- We never have dessert.

141
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,753
I'm a stupid papa.
I'll pick some up on my way home.

142
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:06,820
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get the car fixed.

143
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:08,258
Can I go?

144
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,297
No, because I'm gonna go
running with Hank afterwards.

145
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,994
- We don't mind. We'll watch you.
- No.

146
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:19,503
It's Mama!
I want us to start having desserts, Mama.

147
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:21,973
- Yay! Desserts!
- We never have desserts.

148
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:24,544
- I'm off.
- Okay...

149
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,112
- Get enough to eat?
- Yep.

150
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:27,743
- Bye, Dad!
- See you!

151
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,750
How come Daddy likes desserts,
and you don't?

152
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,945
Daddy's a daddy
and Mommy's a mommy.

153
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,589
Mom.

154
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,518
Honey, we're different people.
We're not the same. We're different.

155
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,969
Hey.

156
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,546
- You signed up for summer classes?
- Sure. Why not?

157
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,042
Oh, man.

158
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:03,946
If I were you, I'd be at the beach
every hour of every day this summer.

159
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:08,518
- I have to make up some credits.
- No.

160
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,660
Anyone who looks like you
doesn't have to do anything.

161
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:14,854
See you, Mr. Evans.

162
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,454
Enjoy!

163
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,329
Won't last forever.

164
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:39,316
Yeah, just check the oil.

165
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,547
- Give it a lube job if you can.
- Sure.

166
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:46,627
I'm just gonna go on a couple errands
with my wife over there...

167
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,370
Duck. I think he's on to you.

168
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,794
Maybe I should start smoking your brand.

169
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,561
Maybe you should ask your husband
to babysit our kids while we fuck.

170
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,534
- He'd be glad to.
- Yeah. Well, she wouldn't.

171
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,674
I think he wants to have sex with her.

172
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:35,910
- Why?
- Why?

173
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,478
- Yeah.
- Because he likes her and she's pretty.

174
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:41,309
He hasn't had any strange pussy
since that French cunt.

175
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,781
I mean, why do you think he wants to?

176
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,648
The way he looks at her,
the way he looked at us...

177
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:50,383
...when we came back from buying beer.
- Oh, yeah? And how was that?

178
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,117
Sheepish.

179
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:56,294
- Does that bother you?
- Me? No.

180
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,829
Good. We can all babysit for each other.

181
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:04,871
"She blooms, she blooms.
And in May, so hurt."

182
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,099
In May, I was alone.

183
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:30,629
Stinky.

184
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:35,902
- You'll get sunburnt.
- No.

185
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,437
And then you'll get caught.

186
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,606
- I should keep the sun off.
- No. I can't. I can't.

187
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:46,578
- Oh, come on. Yes, you can.
- I'm done. I'm old.

188
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,614
I'm wasted.

189
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,353
Have you eaten enough?

190
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,151
I don't know. Let me see.

191
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,559
I mean food.

192
00:18:03,699 --> 00:18:04,927
Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,694
I had Grape-Nuts. I got up late.

194
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,102
Yeah.

195
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,801
You know you ought to live with me.

196
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:15,273
I'd feed you better than that.

197
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,874
She feeds me okay.

198
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:22,877
She gives me what I want.

199
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,542
It's a sublimely happy marriage.

200
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,482
Stop.

201
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,150
I wonder how we'll get caught.

202
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,422
Hank will smell you on me at the gym.

203
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:42,361
No, I mean Terry.
If Hank caught us, I wouldn't care.

204
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,804
I wouldn't stop unless you wanted to,
but you probably would.

205
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,271
Wouldn't you?

206
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:53,107
- No, I wouldn't.
- Yeah, you would.

207
00:18:57,152 --> 00:19:01,384
- What? Don't you think he's gonna notice?
- Well, if he does, it'll be a miracle.

208
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,921
Oh, come on, Jack. You're talking like
he's Charlie Chan or something.

209
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,119
Like he gives a shit.

210
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,700
- Sometimes I think...
- Sometimes you think what?

211
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:21,966
Sometimes I think that I love you even more
than I think that I do, which is a lot.

212
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,240
Which is a lot?

213
00:19:25,013 --> 00:19:27,004
Impotent as you are?

214
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,683
Give me a cigarette.

215
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,863
My last one...

216
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:48,127
...until...

217
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,835
Till...

218
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,171
I don't know. I'll call you.

219
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,490
I'm just gonna grab this.

220
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:14,825
I'm gonna go home, take a nap,
keep the sitter another hour.

221
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:24,870
- You're okay with that?
- It's okay.

222
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,268
Thanks.

223
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,738
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

224
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,884
Mommy.

225
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,252
What?

226
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,750
- Mom, stop it.
- Okay, okay.

227
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,467
- What's this?
- It's a show.

228
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:56,695
Yeah. I know it's a show, honey,
but what show is it?

229
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,499
Space.

230
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,767
Do you wanna go into space
someday, sweetheart?

231
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,970
No. Unless...

232
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:09,516
I don't want to go to space
unless Daddy goes and you too.

233
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,313
Of course Daddy and I'd go with you.

234
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,751
Then, okay.

235
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:13,881
<i>I definitely agree with this.</i>

236
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,198
<i>Houston, I think we got a satellite.</i>

237
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,197
<i>It's quite a sight.</i>

238
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,442
<i>That looks good, thanks.</i>

239
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,112
<i>The alignment key is obviously in place.</i>

240
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,849
<i>Go for rotate.</i>

241
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,797
You can't write, you old fuck.
Let's go for a run.

242
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,594
One goddamn page.

243
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,669
One page in four hours, that's sad.

244
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:15,001
Only three hours, 46 minutes.

245
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:19,438
Think I'd waste an entire four hours
on one goddamn page?

246
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:25,811
Let's run.

247
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,371
Take it you quit.

248
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:54,709
- Goddamn right, goddamn it.
- What's this? The eighth, ninth time?

249
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:58,319
The last time. They're pissing me off.
They're trying to kill me.

250
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,924
Cigarettes don't have souls, Jack.
They don't mean you any harm.

251
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:26,097
Easy, sailor.

252
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,074
You all right there, princess?

253
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,651
Yeah, I'm fine, you competitive prick.

254
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:40,754
You sure?

255
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:56,462
- You're a little screwed up this summer.
- Oh, yeah? Can you tell?

256
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,969
Yep.

257
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:03,207
- I should've worked this summer, man.
- Yeah. Maybe, maybe not.

258
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:06,537
I could use the money.

259
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,379
- Work more.
- A man should be able to live...

260
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:13,680
...idly for a couple of months
without losing his mind.

261
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,485
- Try writing.
- I have. I'm a reader, not a writer.

262
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:22,025
Pussy, not a fighter.

263
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:47,654
Jesus, man. Just smoke it.
You're hopeless.

264
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,386
- You'll smell like an ashtray to Terry.
- Does Edith to you?

265
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,421
No. Not everywhere.

266
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:58,226
- I haven't touched one since Jeanne.
- Yes. Jeanne.

267
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Got me smoking fucking French cigarettes.
Make anybody wanna quit.

268
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:10,074
- Did you end up seeing her before she left?
- Yeah, I saw her.

269
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,640
Remember when I went to New York
to see my agent?

270
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,043
I was in Portland.

271
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,311
Oh, man.

272
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,680
Airport. Tears.

273
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:25,388
That was very romantic. I think about
running into her in Paris in 10 years.

274
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,822
Jesus, man.

275
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:30,590
What can I say? I'm dedicated.
I refuse to let anyone go unloved.

276
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:32,755
Betty!

277
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,633
Mom!

278
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:40,172
What?

279
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:42,276
- Mom!
- Don't hit her with that bat!

280
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:46,245
So why didn't you leave her, Hank?

281
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,807
Who?

282
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,178
Edith.

283
00:27:51,353 --> 00:27:54,220
- Why would I?
- You're in love with another woman.

284
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,018
- Jesus, this isn't the Middle Ages.
- What? It's happened.

285
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:01,424
Men have left their wives
for other women and been happy.

286
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,827
- Until they start cheating on their new wife.
- Sure, whatever.

287
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,796
- It's no use talking to you.
- Why?

288
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,462
You're too nice to fuck somebody
without feeling love. Right?

289
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:14,403
- Right.
- So doing it with love in the mix...

290
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:19,036
...you'd use as proof you didn't love Terry?
- What, you been talking to my mistress?

291
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:24,409
Look, just love everybody you can.

292
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:27,749
Love your kids, love your wife,
keep the peace.

293
00:28:27,922 --> 00:28:29,514
Then once, just once...

294
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:33,523
...try fucking somebody else
just because it feels good.

295
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:38,363
Your wife, you know...

296
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:42,060
...may be living exactly
according to these principles.

297
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:45,228
- That's her business, Hank.
- Brave words.

298
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,999
But true.

299
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:53,737
- What brought all this on, anyway?
- I don't know. Nothing, I guess.

300
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,048
Just see you're unhappy
and I want you to be happy.

301
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:05,690
<i>I have a girl, so Terry gets a lobster.</i>

302
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,796
<i>We get a bottle of wine
and the kids get this shit.</i>

303
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:13,227
Shit.

304
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:15,793
Go on, take it.

305
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:30,140
- Come in for a quick one.
- No, I'm late.

306
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,979
- Come on.
- Shouldn't.

307
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,265
Dad!

308
00:29:57,912 --> 00:29:59,209
Brought home a present.

309
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:12,816
Drink?

310
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:16,797
Okay, we're going to 10. That's two.

311
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:19,229
- No. That's three!
- Okay, three.

312
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:21,029
Four.

313
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:24,603
- Dad, when is it my turn?
- Never.

314
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:26,967
You don't know how to pitch.

315
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:28,938
- Little while, Natasha.
- Hey, gang!

316
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,079
- Let's go for a bike ride.
- No, we're playing catch.

317
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,839
Please. Come on!

318
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:35,880
Come on, Natasha. It's late.

319
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,314
Oh, come on, Jack. It's not that late.

320
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,215
Yeah! Let's go up the river!

321
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,553
- Yeah!
- Fine. Let's ride bikes.

322
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:49,823
- Come on, Mom.
- Honey, go with Daddy. I got stuff to do.

323
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:51,795
Sean, get your helmet on!

324
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,248
- What's the name of this dance?
- "The Angry Housewife."

325
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:58,159
What is that?

326
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,127
<i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich.
I'm thinking of teaching it this fall.</i>

327
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:14,776
I was crazy the other night. I'm sorry.

328
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:17,510
It's okay.

329
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:22,386
I shouldn't have gotten drunk.

330
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,586
Forget it.

331
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:29,154
No, I gotta grow up.

332
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:32,328
What, grownups aren't violent?

333
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:36,961
<i>Not with their husbands.</i>

334
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,367
<i>Read the newspapers.
Women murder their husbands every day.</i>

335
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:46,443
Not people like us.

336
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,487
The other night, did Hank make a pass?

337
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:06,658
Yeah. But he was drinking.

338
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:09,467
And what? You're pretty.

339
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:11,805
Hank likes pretty women.

340
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:20,677
Do you know how much I love you?

341
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:29,417
Yes.

342
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,554
It's not just that. It's more than that.

343
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,674
It's what?

344
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,575
It's how far you've come...

345
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,379
...strong you've gotten.

346
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,913
Do you know what I mean?

347
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:11,829
- Well?
- Well, what?

348
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:15,400
- Well, what did he do?
- None of your business.

349
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,797
All right, then what did you do?

350
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,743
- Nothing.
- Come on.

351
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:30,979
He tried to kiss me on the porch,
so I went inside.

352
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:34,551
Where? Here?

353
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,523
In the kitchen to get a glass of wine.

354
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:41,719
So he followed you
into the kitchen and...

355
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,027
And he told me he loved me...

356
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,137
...he kissed me
and said he didn't love Edith.

357
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:56,004
And I felt dirty and we went outside
and sat on the front steps.

358
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,236
Dirty because...

359
00:34:58,412 --> 00:35:01,347
...what he said about Edith or because...?
- Yeah.

360
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:03,750
Edith's my friend.

361
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:07,345
She's sweet.
She doesn't deserve that bullshit.

362
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,487
I don't wanna be any part of it.

363
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,620
But before that you were all right.

364
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:18,696
I wanna know what you did.

365
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:23,563
Hey, can we stop this?

366
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:31,570
Or do you wanna know if his nose
was to the left or to the right of mine...

367
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:34,112
...when he kissed me?
- You remember?

368
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,917
We were lying on the floor and he was
on my right, so his nose was to the left.

369
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,283
You were lying on the floor.
Goodness gracious.

370
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,756
I was squatting down to get my gla...
Shut up.

371
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,395
What? I'm just kidding.

372
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:53,066
No, you're not, Jack.

373
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:56,296
You're glad he kissed me.

374
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,137
- Let's just say I'm not disturbed by it.
- Well, I am!

375
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:05,543
Okay.

376
00:36:29,837 --> 00:36:31,236
Jack.

377
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,238
Jack.

378
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,086
Look at me.

379
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,151
Look at me.

380
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,813
<i>"It occurred to him that what had
seemed impossible before...</i>

381
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:34,155
<i>...that he had not spent his life as
he should have, might after all be true. "</i>

382
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,455
Hey, let's go.

383
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:41,023
Wake up. You want some pancakes?

384
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:44,134
- I want three pancakes.
- Ready?

385
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:46,603
- Get your plate ready.
- Ready.

386
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,571
Table one.

387
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:59,550
- Hey, let's go.
- It's mine!

388
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,282
- Mommy!
- You guys, have a great time.

389
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,451
<i>"His professional duties and the whole
arrangement of his life and family...</i>

390
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:10,597
<i>...might all have been false. "</i>

391
00:39:13,234 --> 00:39:15,964
"He tried to defend all those things
to himself...

392
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:19,231
...and suddenly felt the weakness
of what he was defending.

393
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,534
There was nothing to defend."

394
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,108
Boring.

395
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:26,643
Jim.

396
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:30,476
- Everything in his life turns out false?
- Doesn't do much about it.

397
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,881
Doesn't do much? He finds God.

398
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:37,457
That tiny bit at the end? Seeing a light
and there being no more pain? Is that it?

399
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,394
Well, the guy does do one major thing.

400
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,359
- What's that?
- He dies.

401
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:50,698
And maybe Tolstoy didn't have it in his
head to write some big, uplifting story...

402
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,465
...about the way we're supposed
to live our lives.

403
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:57,440
Maybe he just wanted to show us
what it was like to die.

404
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:00,038
This is traumatic.

405
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:05,284
Reading your stuff, I see little things
wrong here and there, easy to fix.

406
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,017
And I am noticing, all of a sudden...

407
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,317
...that most of you can write
just as well as me.

408
00:40:15,296 --> 00:40:17,025
It's very depressing.

409
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:26,603
What happened?

410
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:31,076
There's a first half of a story here
that really starts to work...

411
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:33,073
...then just:

412
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,740
What?

413
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:40,080
You gonna tell me you ran out of things
to write about? I won't believe you.

414
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:43,382
I lost focus towards the end.
My boyfriend just moved in...

415
00:40:43,557 --> 00:40:45,457
- Your boyfriend?
- I just mean that...

416
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,060
I just wanna talk about
what's on the page.

417
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:20,720
- Sorry.
- Are you kidding?

418
00:41:23,297 --> 00:41:24,855
All right.

419
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,394
Just this stuff.

420
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,635
Fuck.

421
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,004
HD-Grant
Publishing

422
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,705
Can I get my highlighter, please?

423
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:12,775
Linden.

424
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:16,548
My mother sent some money,
you wanna celebrate?

425
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:24,183
<i>- Yeah. Doon.
- Okay.</i>

426
00:42:25,993 --> 00:42:28,894
<i>- Tomorrow?
- Good.</i>

427
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:55,155
He wants to meet me, tell me how much
he likes it, but he doesn't wanna publish it?

428
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,222
Who needs that?

429
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:02,187
Look, tell him to publish the damn thing,
I'll move into his house and do his laundry.

430
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:06,325
God. Who's depressed?
I'm not depressed.

431
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,001
Bye, Jerry. Fuck.

432
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,030
All you need is one yes.

433
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:21,312
- Where you going?
- I have to do some shopping.

434
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:23,950
- You taking Sharon?
- No. She's outside playing.

435
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:26,086
Christ, Edith, I was gonna write.

436
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:29,746
So write. She's outside playing.

437
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,305
- Where are you going?
- To the library. I'll be back at 4.

438
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:49,033
- Since when?
- Since I have work to do.

439
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,269
- What work?
- Work.

440
00:43:53,113 --> 00:43:55,604
- All right. Give me 50 bucks.
- Why?

441
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:00,684
Fuck why. So I can fly to California.
So I can pay the goddamn plumber.

442
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:02,913
You blew through
Monday's money already?

443
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,288
I can't believe this.
Yeah, my heroin habit's getting expensive.

444
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,761
Give it to me!

445
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:55,508
Give it back!

446
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,678
Give it to me.

447
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,015
Give it back.

448
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:06,786
- Give it to me.
- Hey!

449
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,617
You guys wanna see something?

450
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,497
He thinks it's shit.

451
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,306
Pretty cool, huh?

452
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:38,442
- I hate her.
- No, you don't.

453
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,450
She's your life.

454
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:47,220
- You really love Terry, don't you?
- Yeah.

455
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,721
- I think she's fantastic.
- She is fantastic.

456
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:54,026
She just shouldn't be married to me.

457
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:04,139
- Hey, you want some coffee or anything?
- No, I'm great. Thanks.

458
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,951
I went to the zoo last week with Sharon.

459
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:21,651
- That's a depressing place.
- Yeah, I know.

460
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:24,062
But...

461
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:27,091
...we were watching this gorilla.

462
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:29,997
He took a crap in his hand
and then he licked it.

463
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,340
It's a bit more interesting
than the flamingos, I guess.

464
00:46:38,245 --> 00:46:39,940
Made me cry.

465
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:43,842
I told you it's a depressing place.

466
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,416
He just seemed so human, you know?

467
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,650
Like he knew how trapped he was.

468
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,665
<i>Do you realize how sad it is,
watching you guys?</i>

469
00:47:03,637 --> 00:47:06,629
What do you think the difference is
between you and us?

470
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:09,341
Terry loves you.

471
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:13,236
So you married?

472
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:16,239
- Thirty years.
- Wow.

473
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,648
- Got kids?
- Two. They're married now.

474
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,886
Does your wife take an interest
in your job, I mean...

475
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:32,293
...does she know everything
about plumbing?

476
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:35,902
No, not at all. Nothing.

477
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:39,034
What does she do?

478
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:43,999
She likes to garden. It makes her happy.

479
00:47:56,523 --> 00:47:57,922
Did I say something wrong?

480
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,230
You make me a good wife.

481
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:08,066
If I didn't love you,
I'd have to love somebody else.

482
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:15,267
See, Hank needs us, but...

483
00:48:15,442 --> 00:48:20,277
...he can't really love anyone,
only his work, the rest is surface.

484
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:22,548
<i>I don't believe that.</i>

485
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,449
I don't mean his friendship with you.

486
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,985
He'd give you a kidney if you needed one.

487
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,454
- Yeah, and he'd give you one too.
- Of course he would...

488
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:35,589
...but he wouldn't go
to a marriage counselor.

489
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,961
You know, you're a funny girl.

490
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:42,659
After a long carnivorous fuck,
you talk about a marriage counselor?

491
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,201
Who are you?

492
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:54,239
<i>You know what I wanted.
I wanted to know where we were.</i>

493
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,242
<i>- Now I know.
- And?</i>

494
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,645
<i>You love the person you're having
the affair with.</i>

495
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,442
He'll be busting out soon. Trust me.

496
00:49:57,644 --> 00:49:59,669
I know the routine.

497
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,810
He's been hibernating
with that novel so long.

498
00:50:02,983 --> 00:50:05,577
Next thing you know,
he'll look around and blink...

499
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,619
...and fuck the first thing
that walks into his office.

500
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:11,053
I hope someone goes in there
before I do.

501
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:14,751
Well, he screws his wife once in a while.
Why not another man?

502
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:19,792
And your husband making passes
at my wife, how do you feel about that?

503
00:50:21,334 --> 00:50:24,735
Well, everybody deserves
to be happy, right?

504
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

505
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:46,959
- Hey.
- Hey.

506
00:50:52,597 --> 00:50:54,292
How'd the work go?

507
00:50:59,337 --> 00:51:01,328
Burned my novel, wrote a shitty poem.

508
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,436
How'd the shopping go?

509
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:12,480
Fine.

510
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,288
Get your work done at the library?

511
00:51:27,865 --> 00:51:29,423
Yep.

512
00:51:33,738 --> 00:51:37,469
Hank and Edith are coming over
to watch an old movie on cable tonight.

513
00:51:37,642 --> 00:51:39,735
Great. That's good.

514
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:44,844
- Hank called?
- Yeah. He called.

515
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,250
What? Lobsters?

516
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:53,254
<i>Oh, she's beautiful.
There's no denying that.</i>

517
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:56,985
<i>But you know she does nothing all day
but eat, sleep, walk about...</i>

518
00:51:57,161 --> 00:52:00,028
<i>...fascinate us all by her beauty.
Nothing more.</i>

519
00:52:00,298 --> 00:52:03,096
<i>And an idle life cannot be...</i>

520
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:05,733
<i>...pure.</i>

521
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,305
Hello?

522
00:52:49,347 --> 00:52:51,679
Hey. Hey!

523
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,017
Hello.

524
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:01,491
Hey. Hi, guys. What's going on?

525
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:05,460
- We're celebrating.
- Well, I can see that.

526
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,291
Hank?

527
00:53:07,465 --> 00:53:09,899
<i>The New Yorker's gonna publish
one of my poems.</i>

528
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:14,936
What? That's fantastic! How exciting!
What did Edith say?

529
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:19,339
I haven't had a chance to tell Edith.
She's out shopping.

530
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:22,735
You don't seem very excited.

531
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:25,579
- I am.
- Yeah, what do you know?

532
00:53:26,751 --> 00:53:29,379
Hank, people who know you
like your work.

533
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:33,318
You're being published.
It doesn't get much better than that.

534
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:36,255
It's a poem, Terry.
It's really not that important.

535
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:38,255
No, Hank, it isn't.

536
00:53:38,429 --> 00:53:42,195
You want important, work in a cancer
ward with people puking from chemo.

537
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:46,132
Or teach math to a kid who's
brain-damaged from fetal alcohol syndrome.

538
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:50,965
No, those people generally
aren't that much fun to be around.

539
00:53:54,845 --> 00:53:57,245
Okay. All right.

540
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,042
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

541
00:54:02,219 --> 00:54:05,518
Pulling my head out of my butt.
How about a spoonful of this...

542
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,783
..."dream come true" jumbo split?

543
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:10,894
I'd rather eat vomit. Gotta fly.

544
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,193
Hey.

545
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:19,426
Do me a favor and don't tell Jack, all right?
Allow me the joy of gloating.

546
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:22,401
You'll see him before I will.
You guys are running, right?

547
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:24,040
Are we?

548
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:26,806
Oh, yeah, yeah. We are indeed.

549
00:54:27,545 --> 00:54:30,571
- Okay. Bye, honey.
- See you.

550
00:54:46,998 --> 00:54:50,764
- Hi.
- Terry's turning over leaves.

551
00:54:51,168 --> 00:54:54,899
<i>Dhe said her life had reached
a turning point. Dhe said she would work.</i>

552
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:58,337
<i>Dhe would start right now
by paying for being a slob.</i>

553
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:03,837
<i>For three days after, she made the beds
as soon as we got up in the morning.</i>

554
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:06,876
<i>Dhe folded the laundry by 10.</i>

555
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:09,410
<i>Dhe vacuumed by noon.</i>

556
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:13,014
<i>Dhe wrote lists of chores
for the rest of us.</i>

557
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:25,665
<i>Then on the fourth day...</i>

558
00:55:26,504 --> 00:55:29,200
<i>...her momentum suddenly stopped.</i>

559
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:35,276
So?

560
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:40,042
So then I checked his gym bag,
and the clothes were folded and clean.

561
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:43,252
He didn't even go running,
he fucking lied to me.

562
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:45,150
So confront him.

563
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:48,020
Can't you ask Hank?

564
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:55,160
- Do you want me to ask Hank?
- Yes.

565
00:55:57,468 --> 00:56:01,529
Shit. I don't even know.
I don't know if I wanna know.

566
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:23,251
- Hey.
- Hey.

567
00:56:23,694 --> 00:56:25,628
- How was your run?
- Great.

568
00:56:30,034 --> 00:56:31,661
Lobsters.

569
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:41,469
Fuck you.

570
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:04,626
- Mom!
- Dad!

571
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,448
- What's the matter?
- Still wet.

572
00:57:26,257 --> 00:57:29,226
Lay down. I'll be back in a second.

573
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:35,031
- What else, Terry? What else?
- What?

574
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:37,565
Relax. I'll do them
as soon as I finish this.

575
00:57:37,735 --> 00:57:39,760
It's not what you didn't do, it's why.

576
00:57:39,937 --> 00:57:42,235
Why do we live
in the foulest house I know?

577
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:45,864
Why is it that you say you love our children
and they go unbathed for days?

578
00:57:46,043 --> 00:57:49,171
Right now Sean is upstairs
sleeping in last night's piss.

579
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:51,175
I forgot.

580
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:53,107
Goddamn it!

581
00:57:56,554 --> 00:57:59,318
Goddamn it, Terry. Fucking lazy.

582
00:58:01,425 --> 00:58:03,757
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

583
00:58:04,695 --> 00:58:06,754
Stay here and I'll be back.

584
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:10,162
I'll take the sheets.
It's just a little bit wet, that's okay.

585
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:13,063
It's okay, honey. I love you.

586
00:58:14,238 --> 00:58:16,638
Go back to sleep. Love you.

587
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:02,551
All right.

588
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,154
- I wanna talk to you.
- I'm gonna do the dishes.

589
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:08,018
- No. Now.
- Talk to me while I'm doing the dishes.

590
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:09,750
- Terry...
- Sit down.

591
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:14,263
Don't you take anything. Listen to me.

592
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:20,431
I am tired of being judged.
Who are you to judge me?

593
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:23,602
Now, I forgot that Sean wet his bed...

594
00:59:23,774 --> 00:59:27,005
...but if you got them up one morning
out of every thousand...

595
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:30,669
...if you loved them the way you say
you do... Oh, that was shitty.

596
00:59:30,848 --> 00:59:33,976
Accusing me of not loving
my own children?

597
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:38,649
That's just the way you fight,
like a catty, bitchy woman.

598
00:59:43,394 --> 00:59:47,455
And you know what? If you ever got
them up in the last four or five nights...

599
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,895
...you would've known he hadn't
wet his bed.

600
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:54,333
Come on. He wet his bed three nights ago
and I know that because he told me.

601
00:59:54,505 --> 00:59:56,837
- So what?
- So? You never get the facts right.

602
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,908
You always get it wrong, Terry. Wrong!

603
01:00:00,177 --> 01:00:04,580
You never, ever, ever get it right. It's
the same thing with the sheets, the bills...

604
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:08,013
You always find a way to blow it.
You always have an excuse...

605
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:11,348
...and you're always wrong.
- So, what do you want me to do?

606
01:00:11,522 --> 01:00:15,720
- Do? There's something you can do?
- You son of a bitch!

607
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,184
- Terry!
- Son of a bitch!

608
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:20,592
You son of a bitch!

609
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:24,764
Goddamn it. Goddamn it, Jack.
Goddamn it!

610
01:00:35,946 --> 01:00:38,005
Oh, fuck.

611
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,283
<i>It was the day after payday,
and I gave Hank $50 I had owed him.</i>

612
01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:54,924
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
He paid me!

613
01:00:55,099 --> 01:00:57,624
<i>He made a big deal about
not needing the money.</i>

614
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,666
Thank you so much.

615
01:01:00,304 --> 01:01:05,264
<i>Then, later that night, he fucked my wife
in the front seat of my car.</i>

616
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:05,634
Where were you?

617
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:09,734
Woke up, couldn't get to sleep,
so I went for a walk.

618
01:02:10,441 --> 01:02:13,774
You don't have to tell me that.
I've been up since 1:30.

619
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:16,845
You're such a bastard.

620
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,818
- Did you ever go to sleep?
- Yes.

621
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:30,885
- Sure you did.
- What, I was tired. Yes.

622
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:35,492
- Why didn't you just bring me to bed?
- Why didn't you come to bed?

623
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:41,160
Because I need to be made love to.

624
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:47,601
You don't make love to me anymore.
You fuck me.

625
01:02:49,046 --> 01:02:54,712
I sat on those steps with Hank and
he held my hand and he listened to me.

626
01:02:55,486 --> 01:02:58,614
<i>He listened to me while I talked
about this shitty marriage.</i>

627
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,052
<i>And he told me he felt close to me.</i>

628
01:03:03,894 --> 01:03:06,454
And I was happy when he said it.

629
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:10,229
And I was happy
when I made love to him.

630
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:14,631
I was so goddamn happy for a minute,
and then I thought of you.

631
01:03:16,907 --> 01:03:21,139
I just wanted to be here with you
and get us back.

632
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:25,213
And be in this fucking bed,
in this house...

633
01:03:25,382 --> 01:03:28,442
...with my husband and my kids
where I belong.

634
01:03:28,919 --> 01:03:32,616
That's a really admirable sentiment, Terry.

635
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:34,120
Fuck.

636
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:36,687
Jack...

637
01:03:38,128 --> 01:03:40,756
...right now I love you...

638
01:03:41,064 --> 01:03:43,555
...maybe more than I have for years.

639
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:45,462
But I am angry.

640
01:03:45,636 --> 01:03:50,664
I am so fucking angry, Jack, way down,
because you set this fucking thing up.

641
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:54,902
You set it up and it happened. And I don't
know what else is gonna happen.

642
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:57,070
Why? You gonna see him again?

643
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:59,647
God. Jesus Christ, Jack.
I don't know.

644
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:01,044
What?

645
01:04:01,552 --> 01:04:03,782
Then it's over.
Is that what you're saying?

646
01:04:03,954 --> 01:04:08,186
What's wrong with you?
Think making love is like smoking?

647
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:10,121
- It's...
- It's what?

648
01:04:11,328 --> 01:04:13,888
It's a promise.

649
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,858
You promised him you'll see him again.

650
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:20,470
I didn't say anything.
Opening my legs is a promise.

651
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:23,265
And he didn't say anything, either?

652
01:04:24,141 --> 01:04:26,234
He must have said something.

653
01:04:26,476 --> 01:04:28,774
Oh, my God, you like this.

654
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:32,138
You want details, huh?

655
01:04:32,316 --> 01:04:33,908
Fine.

656
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:36,878
We drove around for a while.

657
01:04:38,622 --> 01:04:41,056
He put his hand on my tit...

658
01:04:42,426 --> 01:04:45,293
...and I practically got off
just from him touching me.

659
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:52,792
You know what happened then?
We parked and we fucked like crazy.

660
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,000
And you know what, Jack?

661
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:58,975
I came before he did.

662
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:02,670
And the second time, I was on top.

663
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:06,015
And I looked in his face,
I looked right in his eyes...

664
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:09,448
...and I told him I loved him.
- That's enough, all right?

665
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,087
Enough.

666
01:05:11,555 --> 01:05:15,184
You should be knocking my teeth out,
but not you, huh?

667
01:05:16,693 --> 01:05:19,924
Not you. Because you like it.

668
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,897
Wanna watch us, Jack?

669
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:23,794
This comes to you...

670
01:05:26,703 --> 01:05:28,637
Fuck who you want, when you want...

671
01:05:29,006 --> 01:05:34,205
...but don't give me half-assed insights into
the soul of a man you have never understood.

672
01:05:34,378 --> 01:05:36,005
Your insights suck.

673
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:42,851
Oh, Jesus Christ.

674
01:05:44,755 --> 01:05:47,383
My "half-assed insights."

675
01:05:47,924 --> 01:05:51,360
"Into the soul of a man
I don't understand."

676
01:05:54,231 --> 01:05:55,596
You poor baby.

677
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:57,794
Oh, my God.

678
01:05:57,968 --> 01:06:01,597
You poor little baby.

679
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:05,634
You talk and talk.

680
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:09,142
You think you know yourself,
but you know what?

681
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,807
You're a pervert.

682
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:16,975
I'm gonna go to sleep. We got a couple
of kids that are getting up soon.

683
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:19,213
You're not known for getting breakfast.

684
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:20,947
I'll do it. Forget it.

685
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:23,684
Thanks. It's one thing you can help with.

686
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,795
Unfortunately, you can't help me
with my other problem.

687
01:06:27,464 --> 01:06:30,456
See, Jack, I'm not sure what to do.

688
01:06:30,934 --> 01:06:33,095
I mean, tomorrow. What do I say?

689
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:35,864
"Gee, Hank, that was last night...

690
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,634
...and this is now, and I just don't know
if I wanna fuck anymore."

691
01:06:39,943 --> 01:06:44,073
You gotta admit,
even adultery has morality to it.

692
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:46,675
So I got some things to figure out.

693
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,818
- You do what you can.
- Thanks, Jack.

694
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:51,613
- Good night.
- I'll do what I can.

695
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:35,589
<i>- Hello.
- They did it last night.</i>

696
01:07:35,932 --> 01:07:37,160
Come over.

697
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,781
Wait, wait, wait. Where's Hank?

698
01:07:57,954 --> 01:08:00,047
- He's sleeping.
- Upstairs?

699
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:03,351
Yeah. He'll go to the bathroom first,
don't worry.

700
01:08:03,627 --> 01:08:07,654
- We'll hear him. Come on, fuck me.
- Okay.

701
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:51,837
Oh, God.

702
01:10:37,814 --> 01:10:38,872
<i>Come on back here!</i>

703
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:44,647
<i>Come on. Take the gold! Get the gold!</i>

704
01:11:00,403 --> 01:11:02,268
He's gonna hit that guy soon.

705
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:05,101
- Which guy?
- The big fat mean guy.

706
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:06,503
How do you know?

707
01:11:06,676 --> 01:11:10,077
Because if he doesn't hit him,
he won't feel good about himself.

708
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:17,680
Go to sleep.

709
01:11:17,854 --> 01:11:21,255
Tanya, we'll be back at 12:30.
Don't talk to boys.

710
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:25,087
Tanya, can you put two shirts on them?
They get cold at night. Thanks.

711
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:27,320
<i>- Just one.
- Bye, Mama. See you later.</i>

712
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:28,725
Night, gang.

713
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:33,393
- Finally.
- Congratulations.

714
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:41,470
I have to thank my lovely muse.

715
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:54,656
- Hey, Joe. How's it going?
- Good.

716
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:58,783
- Hank's in good shape these days.
- He's always in good shape. All days.

717
01:11:58,962 --> 01:12:00,953
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. New Yorker.</i>

718
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,296
<i>- Hey, Hank, The New Yorker.
- Hey.</i>

719
01:12:08,471 --> 01:12:10,496
- Smooth.
- Christ.

720
01:12:10,907 --> 01:12:12,602
Don't know if I can handle this.

721
01:12:12,776 --> 01:12:15,768
Be careful what you ask for,
you just might get it.

722
01:12:17,781 --> 01:12:22,184
- So cheers to Hank.
- Hank.

723
01:12:26,423 --> 01:12:28,391
Good night.

724
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:35,729
Of course.

725
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:39,096
Terry's tired. I'm gonna run her home.
Take your car, okay?

726
01:12:39,269 --> 01:12:42,329
- Have fun.
- Enjoyed it. Nice.

727
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:58,743
- He's giving her a lift home.
- Among other things.

728
01:12:58,922 --> 01:13:01,447
I think you should tell him now.

729
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:06,524
- I can't.
- Why not?

730
01:13:06,696 --> 01:13:09,221
- I don't know.
- Why not?

731
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:12,224
I don't know.

732
01:13:17,507 --> 01:13:20,840
- Don't.
- What?

733
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,810
I'd like to just concentrate on
hating his guts right now.

734
01:13:46,536 --> 01:13:50,063
Not this way, not after 10 fucking years.

735
01:13:52,308 --> 01:13:55,800
I just spent the last three hours at Willie's.

736
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:58,914
You know, the bar
all the bag ladies drink in?

737
01:13:59,349 --> 01:14:02,785
Alone in a bar for the first time in my life.

738
01:14:05,722 --> 01:14:07,587
Alone in a bar.

739
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:11,286
- What happened?
- Never mind what happened.

740
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:13,861
- All right.
- That's why you have strikes against me.

741
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,760
I drink more than any woman we know.

742
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:19,868
I'm the only woman who keeps up
with the men at parties.

743
01:14:20,036 --> 01:14:22,436
I'm drinking in the afternoon.

744
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,405
You'll get rid of me that way.

745
01:14:26,776 --> 01:14:28,175
So...

746
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,377
Yeah.

747
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:36,274
I drink a lot.

748
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:41,087
Especially on nights when my husband
sends me off to fuck his friend.

749
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:43,418
Don't you wanna stop that, Terry?

750
01:14:48,298 --> 01:14:50,459
Give me a reason, Jack.

751
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,066
I was...

752
01:14:56,339 --> 01:14:58,671
...thinking tonight about...

753
01:15:01,978 --> 01:15:05,846
...when I was 10,
my dad taught me how to fish.

754
01:15:06,716 --> 01:15:10,447
And I was just praying,
"Please, God, let me catch one fish."

755
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:12,922
Just one, you know?

756
01:15:13,256 --> 01:15:17,090
As if the luck of catching a fish
would make me more lovable.

757
01:15:19,696 --> 01:15:23,826
But then it would follow that
to be unlucky is to be unlovable.

758
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:27,326
And luck isn't an element in my life now.

759
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:30,634
It just isn't.

760
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,303
And for some reason,
you hate me for this house of mine...

761
01:15:34,477 --> 01:15:36,502
...because it's filthy sometimes.

762
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:38,169
I don't hate you, Terry.

763
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:42,348
Jack, how would you know if you
hated me? You don't even know me.

764
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:44,748
- I know you, Terry.
- No, you don't, Jack.

765
01:15:44,921 --> 01:15:46,650
- I do know you.
- No.

766
01:15:48,224 --> 01:15:50,556
You say, "You are what you do"?

767
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:53,195
Who really believes that?

768
01:15:53,363 --> 01:15:55,957
I mean, what does that mean?

769
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:58,360
Does that mean I'm a cook...

770
01:15:58,534 --> 01:16:02,265
...an errand runner, a fucker,
a goddamn cleaning lady?

771
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:07,507
Because if you, you bastard,
lost all discipline and folded up...

772
01:16:07,677 --> 01:16:12,876
...and turned drunk and got bald
and lost everything, I'd love you.

773
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:15,678
I love you.

774
01:16:16,419 --> 01:16:19,013
You, Jack.

775
01:16:22,392 --> 01:16:25,555
But if you love me for what I do
instead of for what I am...

776
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:28,219
...and there's a difference,
I know there is...

777
01:16:28,398 --> 01:16:31,299
...then what are you loving
when I fuck Hank?

778
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:34,134
What is it in you that lets me do that?

779
01:16:34,304 --> 01:16:37,273
Or is that just another one of the tricks
I do for you?

780
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,968
Screw Hank, shake hands, sit,
roll over, play dead, fetch...

781
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,204
...Iove me like a dog.

782
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:46,242
I love Edith.

783
01:16:47,684 --> 01:16:50,084
- What?
- I love Edith.

784
01:16:52,555 --> 01:16:56,855
- Jack. Don't do this, please.
- Terry...

785
01:16:57,627 --> 01:17:00,152
- Please, please.
- Terry...

786
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:03,094
- Please.
- Terry, no!

787
01:17:03,266 --> 01:17:07,225
Just take it. Jesus Christ. Just take it.

788
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:29,320
So when are you leaving?

789
01:17:32,095 --> 01:17:33,926
I don't know.

790
01:17:34,764 --> 01:17:36,391
Maybe you should go today.

791
01:18:13,703 --> 01:18:15,102
Why don't you come to bed?

792
01:18:15,271 --> 01:18:16,829
I wanna clean my house.

793
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:43,692
You should see the house.

794
01:18:51,641 --> 01:18:53,131
What's she doing?

795
01:18:53,309 --> 01:18:55,539
She's doing everything.

796
01:18:56,979 --> 01:18:59,004
Are you talking to Daddy?

797
01:18:59,182 --> 01:19:00,877
Hey, come here.

798
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:08,019
- Is it true that you don't love Mom?
- Who said that?

799
01:19:08,191 --> 01:19:09,920
I heard Mom last night.

800
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,394
Wait a second.

801
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:14,892
Are you getting divorced?

802
01:19:15,131 --> 01:19:17,998
Natasha said you were leaving.

803
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:24,303
I wanna live with you.

804
01:19:24,474 --> 01:19:26,499
I'm not going to choose.

805
01:19:27,777 --> 01:19:31,213
Now, you guys, that's just
Mama and Daddy fighting at night.

806
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:35,316
Mom says you're leaving
and you love Edith and you screwed her.

807
01:19:36,619 --> 01:19:37,984
You know what that means?

808
01:19:38,521 --> 01:19:39,920
Yes.

809
01:19:40,156 --> 01:19:42,147
- You do?
- What?

810
01:19:42,592 --> 01:19:44,150
What what means?

811
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:47,157
Now listen to me.

812
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,757
Listening?

813
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:53,264
That's just adult foolishness, okay?

814
01:19:53,636 --> 01:19:55,263
Understand?

815
01:19:56,072 --> 01:19:57,334
Come here.

816
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:03,040
Let's go on our bikes.

817
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:05,914
Yeah.

818
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:44,948
- You know what's out there?
- The moon, the sun...

819
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:49,990
- Yeah, I do.
- Uranus, Pluto, Mercury.

820
01:20:50,393 --> 01:20:54,386
Venus, Mars, moon.

821
01:20:54,764 --> 01:20:57,392
Sun. Jupiter.

822
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:08,107
Did you know the universe is so big
that nobody can even count how big...

823
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:12,680
How many feet it is?
So people say "googol." "It's googol."

824
01:21:12,848 --> 01:21:15,749
See these rocks?
Guess how old they are.

825
01:21:15,918 --> 01:21:17,510
- Hundred years old?
- Nope.

826
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:20,781
These rocks have been here
from the very first cells.

827
01:21:20,957 --> 01:21:23,824
The first cells were the first thing
on the Earth.

828
01:21:23,993 --> 01:21:26,291
Then maybe these rocks were...

829
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,226
Who were the first people
on the planet?

830
01:21:33,402 --> 01:21:38,339
If you believe in God, it's Adam and Eve...

831
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:40,634
...and if you don't, apes.

832
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:45,210
Did you know that they just found things
that said that God had a wife?

833
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:47,144
It's true. In real life they did.

834
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:49,113
What if they don't believe in God?

835
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:52,685
No, I mean, people that look for him
thought that.

836
01:22:42,371 --> 01:22:43,998
Was it awful?

837
01:22:44,674 --> 01:22:46,335
Was what awful?

838
01:22:51,213 --> 01:22:53,147
What's this? What are you doing?

839
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,014
I thought that's where you went
to tell the kids.

840
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:02,414
Unpack it, please.

841
01:23:03,192 --> 01:23:05,251
Why? Couldn't you tell them?

842
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,427
I don't want to.

843
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:12,464
Okay, I'II...

844
01:23:12,902 --> 01:23:15,336
...call them in and we'll both tell them.

845
01:23:16,338 --> 01:23:18,806
I mean I don't wanna leave, Terry.

846
01:23:20,743 --> 01:23:23,211
Jack, I know it's the kids.

847
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,783
No.

848
01:23:31,754 --> 01:23:34,848
Is it just the kids? You can
see them whenever you want.

849
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,022
I won't make a big deal out of it.

850
01:23:37,193 --> 01:23:39,627
You know I wouldn't put us through that.

851
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:44,030
And if it's just telling them,
we can do it and get it over with.

852
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,664
It's not the kids, Terry.

853
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:50,068
It's not the kids.

854
01:23:53,409 --> 01:23:55,843
Just unpack my bags, okay?

855
01:24:15,898 --> 01:24:18,389
We can do this.

856
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:22,997
It'll be okay.

857
01:24:40,089 --> 01:24:42,148
She didn't mean it.

858
01:24:46,662 --> 01:24:48,653
Honey, what's wrong?

859
01:24:50,099 --> 01:24:53,125
Somebody was mean to her at school.

860
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,836
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

861
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:40,712
Hey.

862
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:43,516
Hey.

863
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,849
Edith wants to see you tonight.

864
01:25:55,998 --> 01:25:57,693
She's gonna tell Hank.

865
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:00,092
She probably already told him.

866
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:02,360
She said he won't mind.

867
01:26:02,571 --> 01:26:04,766
Yeah, I know.

868
01:26:07,476 --> 01:26:09,671
I told her about Hank and me.

869
01:26:10,613 --> 01:26:12,012
She talked about you two.

870
01:26:12,181 --> 01:26:13,842
Terry...

871
01:26:14,516 --> 01:26:16,211
...please don't.

872
01:26:16,952 --> 01:26:19,819
I'm sure it was a fine afternoon.

873
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:22,353
It was, in a way.

874
01:26:26,829 --> 01:26:28,660
It's gonna snow.

875
01:26:45,547 --> 01:26:46,878
Hey.

876
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:50,912
Want some coffee?

877
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:52,610
No.

878
01:26:53,355 --> 01:26:54,583
Drink?

879
01:26:55,824 --> 01:26:57,758
Yeah. Scotch.

880
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:01,962
Take a seat.

881
01:27:33,829 --> 01:27:37,424
Well, I think this is probably a good time
for me to go see a movie.

882
01:27:52,915 --> 01:27:55,816
Hey, Hank? Hank.

883
01:28:02,925 --> 01:28:04,449
What?

884
01:28:07,963 --> 01:28:09,191
You knew all along.

885
01:28:09,898 --> 01:28:11,798
I'm not real slow.

886
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:20,933
You okay?

887
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:26,610
I'm drowning in shit.

888
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:30,077
I'll be laughing soon.

889
01:28:30,486 --> 01:28:31,817
Hey, listen.

890
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:34,845
Gonna dedicate my new novel to you.

891
01:28:35,491 --> 01:28:37,721
I wrote three new chapters this week.

892
01:28:40,429 --> 01:28:43,296
It's much easier living with a woman
who feels loved.

893
01:29:08,524 --> 01:29:12,187
He said he was happy for us
and now he's sad for us.

894
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:18,393
He's happy that you were taking care of me
and now he's sorry that you can't.

895
01:30:41,283 --> 01:30:42,614
I can't.

896
01:30:46,155 --> 01:30:47,952
Too sad.

897
01:32:15,177 --> 01:32:16,769
What's going on?

898
01:32:24,086 --> 01:32:25,610
Where's Sharon?

899
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:29,188
She's outside waiting in the car.

900
01:32:30,225 --> 01:32:31,817
I...

901
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:36,088
I'm gonna take her to my mother's
for a while.

902
01:32:37,866 --> 01:32:39,390
Why?

903
01:32:42,104 --> 01:32:43,867
What for? What's going on?

904
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,513
Edith.

905
01:32:55,183 --> 01:32:56,445
Edith.

906
01:32:57,319 --> 01:32:59,685
Edith, stop.

907
01:33:00,322 --> 01:33:02,051
Edith, Edith, Edith, please.

908
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,622
Stop.

909
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:07,060
I'll stop.

910
01:33:12,668 --> 01:33:16,729
I'm not leaving you because you're
unfaithful. I'm leaving because I was.

911
01:33:16,905 --> 01:33:19,430
Well, none of that matters anymore.
That's over.

912
01:33:19,608 --> 01:33:21,098
Isn't it?

913
01:33:23,912 --> 01:33:25,641
Isn't it, Edith?

914
01:33:26,181 --> 01:33:28,547
Yeah. It's over.

915
01:33:28,717 --> 01:33:30,742
Well, then why leave now?

916
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:35,513
Because I can.
