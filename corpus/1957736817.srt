<i>and it looks so scary.</i>

165
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:38,099
It's-- I dunno. I went
to one a few weeks back and--

166
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,466
<i>Oh, really? Oh, my God.</i>

167
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,935
[Naomi]
Yeah, yeah.

168
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,402
<i>It's kind of crazy, right?</i>
It was a little--

169
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,071
The vibe wasn't crazy.

170
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,473
Like, no one's doing anything
violent, you know what I--

171
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,042
-Like, the ones who are--
<i>-I mean...</i>

172
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,510
-What?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

173
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,078
<i>I'm obviously not there</i>

174
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,781
<i>so I don't, like, have</i>
<i>all the information.</i>

175
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,384
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I feel like the part of it</i>

176
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,620
<i>that's protesting</i>
<i>is really cool.</i>

177
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,355
-[Naomi] Yeah.
<i>-And then part of it that's</i>

178
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,457
<i>destroying stuff...</i>

179
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,894
<i>Like, do you</i>
<i>have to destroy Target</i>

180
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,696
<i>to make a point?</i>

181
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,131
<i>Because I feel like there's</i>

182
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,399
<i>peaceful protesting,</i>

183
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,967
<i>and then</i>
<i>there's, like, rioting.</i>

184
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,467
<i>And like, MLK was--</i>

185
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,171
<i>di-- He did, like,</i>
<i>peaceful protesting.</i>

186
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:21,575
And he got shot in
the face anyway. So...

187
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,678
I mean, I know that.

188
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,180
Yeah, I-- Yeah.

189
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,318
<i>It's complicated. It's</i>
<i>like, when people are like,</i>

190
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,786
<i>"The cops are being violent."</i>

191
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>I'm like, well,</i>
<i>probably not every cop</i>

192
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,722
<i>is being violent.</i>

193
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,758
I mean, not every protester
is being violent either.

194
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,961
Ooh. My hair. Look at this.
[scoffs]

195
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,461
<i>It looks good.</i>

196
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,431
-[Naomi] Thank you.
<i>-Look at my hair.</i>

197
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:44,865
-It looks really good.
-[Sara] <i>Frizzy.</i>

198
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,499
-It looks like--
<i>-It's frizzy from the air.</i>

199
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,468
It must be humid
down there right now.

200
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,837
<i>Yeah, it's so hot.</i>

201
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:55,743
Um. Yeah. I don't know.
I guess I just, um...

202
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:58,913
-Protesting gets stuff done--
<i>-I--</i>

203
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:01,248
-- and sometimes
you gotta be a little violent

204
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,883
to get stuff done, that's all.

205
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,720
That's just what I think.

206
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,622
<i>Totally.</i>

207
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,658
Yeah.

208
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,565
Um, but this dinner
when you get back. Hello?

209
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:19,600
<i>I'll bring wine from Florida.</i>

210
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,202
Florida wine, what's that like?

211
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:22,370
[Sara]
<i>You'll hate it.</i>

212
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,604
What's that like?
Is there, like--

213
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,172
[Sara]
<i>So sweet.</i>

214
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,941
It's, like, really
sweet and kind of, like, gross?

215
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,709
<i>Well, I'm just thinking</i>
<i>of the one my mom has.</i>

216
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,344
<i>My mom's wine sucks.</i>

217
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,179
You want to bring me bottles
of your mom's shitty wine?

218
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,948
<i>Well, I just want to</i>
<i>bring bottles of her wine</i>

219
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:37,585
<i>so that she is confused</i>
<i>as to where they went.</i>

220
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,053
-[Naomi] Sure.
<i>-Because I'm annoyed at her</i>

221
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,055
<i>-right now.</i>
-Wait. Okay, so just to be

222
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,125
clear: you want to feed me
your mom's shitty wine,

223
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,027
um, to inconvenience your mom?

224
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:49,397
<i>Yeah. It's a perfect</i>
<i>situation where no one wins.</i>

225
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:51,499
Yeah, I-- Actually,
I really love that.

226
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,401
I actually--
I love being used as a pawn,

227
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,403
um, in that particular way.

228
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:56,937
So, I want to say
thank you in advance.

229
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:58,739
-And I can't wait to try this--
<i>-Of course--</i>

230
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,175
-- this, uh, swamp swill is
what I'm gonna call it.

231
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,610
Is that offensive?

232
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,645
<i>No, I-- I don't really know.</i>

233
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,647
<i>I don't really</i>
<i>know what's offensive.</i>

234
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,449
<i>I feel like every day</i>
<i>I learn about something,</i>

235
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,585
<i>like, that's offensive that</i>
<i>I didn't know is offensive.</i>

236
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,889
Yeah. I feel like
sometimes you say something

237
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,590
that's offensive and I'm like,

238
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,325
"I can't
believe Sara said that."

239
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,894
<i>Wait, really?</i>

240
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:21,562
[Naomi] Yeah,
but, like, not in like a--

241
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,164
<i>You have to tell me.</i>
<i>So embarrassing.</i>

242
00:09:23,264 --> 00:09:25,534
I tell you all the time.
I tell you all the time.

243
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,101
-Yeah.
<i>-No way, dude.</i>

244
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,803
[Naomi] I feel like at least
once or twice a month

245
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,137
-you say something that I'm--
-[phone beeping]

246
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,006
Oh, shit.
Ooh! This is Reed. I gotta go.

247
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:33,607
<i>Oh, okay, okay,</i>
<i>love you, love you.</i>

248
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,043
-Bye, love you.
<i>-Talk later. Bye.</i>

249
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:40,848
-[beeping]
-Hey!

250
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,650
<i>-Yo!</i>
-[Naomi] How's it goin?

251
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,652
<i>Chillin', chillin'.</i>
<i>What about you?</i>

252
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,387
I'm doing a lot of the same.

253
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,722
Uh... What's new?
[chuckles]

254
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:51,659
<i>You know, I gotta ask.</i>
<i>Every time we chat,</i>

255
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,194
<i>you know I gotta ask.</i>

256
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,830
<i>How's, uh, Mariska</i>
<i>and how's, uh, Elliot?</i>

257
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,631
<i>-I don't know these names--</i>
-[Naomi] Dude. Dude.

258
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,500
Okay. So, first of all,
I'm on a season that Elliot

259
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,968
is no longer on, so,
like, take it--

260
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,903
Take that down,
write that down. Um...

261
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,473
<i>-Okay. Let me find a pen.</i>
-[Naomi laughs]

262
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,108
But Mariska's good.
She's good.

263
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,943
She's kicking ass,
she's taking names.

264
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:10,978
Do you know who the character--
the person she's based on

265
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,849
is the woman who prosecuted,
uh, the Central Park Five?

266
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:16,450
<i>Did you know I didn't know</i>

267
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:18,219
<i>she was based</i>
<i>on anybody at all?</i>

268
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,654
I think
they were more just like,

269
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:21,989
"Oh, yeah, she's like a,
you know,

270
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,024
strong girlboss feminist.
La la la--"

271
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,759
Which she is in the show,
in many ways.

272
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,661
Um, except in the earlier
seasons where she's pretty

273
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,230
transphobic,
if we're being honest.

274
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,998
But that's not her fault.
She's a fictional character.

275
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,766
It is the writers' fault.
And that's why they need to

276
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,869
diversify writers' rooms, bro.

277
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,670
<i>Okay. And there you go.</i>
<i>You popped off once again.</i>

278
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,339
[Naomi laughs]

279
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,975
I feel like every time
you make fun of me popping off,

280
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,645
Um, I dunno, an angel gets
its wings. I don't know.

281
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,380
I don't know where
I was going with that. Anyway,

282
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,882
<i>-Sure.</i>
-how's frickin'--

283
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,884
-What are you watching again?
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

284
00:10:49,984 --> 00:10:52,653
<i>I was just, uh, FaceTiming</i>
<i>with my buddy, Brandon.</i>

285
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:56,357
<i>Um, and he was saying</i>
<i>how</i> Saving Silverman

286
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:58,092
<i>isn't that funny of a movie.</i>

287
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,395
<i>And then we got in this</i>
<i>huge discussion about how he</i>

288
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:06,200
<i>thinks Steve Zahn is not</i>
<i>a good actor/comedic actor.</i>

289
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,768
What?

290
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,270
[Reed]
<i>It's frickin' Steve Zahn.</i>

291
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,672
<i>He was in</i> Reality Bites.
You've Got Mail.

292
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,807
<i>And of course,</i>
Saving Silverman.

293
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:14,909
<i>-And that has the guy--</i>
-I--

294
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,210
<i>who fucked the pie in it.</i>

295
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,279
Okay. I actually
do know about that scene

296
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,147
in that particular movie.
But I do want to remind you

297
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,318
that, um, as much as I love
talking to you about films,

298
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,387
I've seen exactly one
film in my entire life.

299
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,590
And I don't even know
if you can call it a film.

300
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,024
It's more of a movie, really.

301
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,126
Um, and it is
the Kenan Thompson vehicle,

302
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:36,430
uh, 1996's <i>Heavyweights,</i> uh,
about the weight loss scam.

303
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,266
<i>Anytime I bring up</i>
<i>any movie, you either go,</i>

304
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,136
<i>"This is a-- Reminds</i>
<i>me of an episode of</i> SVU,"

305
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45,072
<i>or you say, "You know,</i>
<i>this guy actually reminds me</i>

306
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,241
<i>a little bit of Kenan Thompson</i>
<i>in</i> Heavyweights."

307
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,910
I don't know what to tell you.
I've seen one movie.

308
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,479
You-- I can talk about TV
until the cows come home,

309
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,148
especially in a pandemic.

310
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,383
I've been watching-- You know,
there's-- It's kind of all

311
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,787
I do, is, like, cook food
and watch television shows

312
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,255
that I've already seen.

313
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,357
Do you know that they say
that people who watch

314
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,859
the same show, like-- like,
episodes they already seen,

315
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,494
they're doing
it because it, like,

316
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,163
provides a sense
of, like, comfort?

317
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,332
<i>Okay. Because I've</i>
<i>been rewatching</i> Survivor,

318
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,734
<i>and I'm just, like,</i>
<i>over and over watching--</i>

319
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,236
<i>And you know what's fucked up?</i>

320
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,937
<i>Is I know</i>
<i>who wins every season.</i>

321
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,673
<i>And I still watch</i>
<i>it and I'm always like,</i>

322
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,074
<i>"I'm rooting for other</i>
<i>people that are--</i>

323
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,242
<i>that I know</i>
<i>are not gonna win."</i>

324
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:22,711
[laughs]

325
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,812
I'm always rooting
for, uh, the Black person.

326
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,548
And then once the Black
person gets eliminated,

327
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,115
like, the next Blackest
person.

328
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,783
You know, like,
if there's someone

329
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,252
who even looks
like they could have

330
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,487
like, someone Black
in their past, like--

331
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,056
<i>So, if you got eliminated,</i>
<i>you'd be rooting for me next?</i>

332
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,291
Yes.

333
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,159
[Reed]
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

334
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,794
-[Naomi] Yes.
<i>-On the scale,</i>

335
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,329
<i>I'm over here.</i>
<i>You're over here.</i>

336
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,531
[laughs]

337
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:46,834
Um... Wait, are you Black?

338
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,335
<i>-No. No--</i>
-[Naomi] Oh, okay. Okay--

339
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,271
-I just didn't know--
<i>-I'm just saying I'm not</i>

340
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:52,039
<i>white. Just saying I'm not</i>
<i>white. I'm just not white.</i>

341
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,808
Okay. That is-- That is clear.
I will say that is clear

342
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,611
and I appreciate that a lot
about you.

343
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:57,712
[both laughing]

344
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,980
Um... Oh, my God.

345
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,449
Can I tell you something
crazy I did this morning?

346
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,653
<i>Tell me the craziest thing</i>
<i>you did ever this morning.</i>

347
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,120
[Naomi]
Dude. Are you ready for this?

348
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,656
<i>-Go off.</i>
-I was walking down the street.

349
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,089
I was coming back
from the grocery store.

350
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,525
And someone had put,
like, a box of records

351
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,959
outside their house.

352
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,762
And I was like, "Oh,
my God, should I do this?

353
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,162
Like, should I do this?

354
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,665
Like, is this okay
to do in a pandemic?"

355
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:20,100
And... I did it.
And I found one.

356
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,136
And it is not a first pressing,

357
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,871
so don't get excited, but
it is <i>Wowee Zowee</i> by Pavement.

358
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,675
-What? Can you believe--
<i>-Whoa! Holy flip flops.</i>

359
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,042
Did you say, "Holy flip flops"?

360
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:29,711
[Reed] <i>I did.</i>
<i>I'm having fun with it.</i>

361
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,646
Why do I keep
talking to you? Oh, my God.

362
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:34,882
[laughs] <i>It's endearing. It's</i>
<i>fucked up. It's endearing.</i>

363
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,351
Yeah. That's part
of your charm. And the hair.

364
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:38,986
Which way are we parting it?

365
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,287
Which way are
we parting it today?

366
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,455
<i>Today it's this way.</i>

367
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:42,524
<i>We got a little bit of volume.</i>

368
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:43,625
<i>But you know what?</i>

369
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:45,059
<i>Uh, how about, uh, you see</i>

370
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,295
<i>in person how,</i>
<i>uh-- how I part it?</i>

371
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,165
[Naomi] Oh, shit.
Are we, like, gonna do it?

372
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,167
Feel like we've been talking
about it for a long time.

373
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,936
<i>I mean, you're safer than</i>
<i>anybody I know at this point.</i>

374
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,672
That's a really
nice thing to say.

375
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:59,106
That's a really,
really nice thing to say.

376
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,308
<i>You know I'm a nice guy.</i>

377
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:02,577
[both laugh]

378
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:04,144
Wait. So, okay, are we gonna--

379
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,879
What are we gonna do?
Are we gonna do this? Like--

380
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,149
<i>Yeah, uh, let's think.</i>
<i>Well, we could...</i>

381
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,385
<i>We can get sushi,</i>
<i>take it to the park.</i>

382
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,454
Sit six feet apart?

383
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:15,389
<i>Yeah. You know what?</i>
<i>We'll sit eight feet apart.</i>

384
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:16,857
<i>We'll be extra safe.</i>

385
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,892
Whoa. Okay. I actually
really like a guy who,

386
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:21,028
like, takes my safety
into extra consideration.

387
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,030
-Like, that's great.
<i>-You know what? Safety's sexy.</i>

388
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,566
<i>That's the number one catch</i>
<i>phrase in America right now.</i>

389
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,266
It actually is really hot.
Oh, wait, can I show you?

390
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,469
I've been ordering, like,
a bunch of stupid shit

391
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,238
off the Internet. And I got
the coolest new dress.

392
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:32,906
-Can I show you?
<i>-Please show me.</i>

393
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,509
Oh, my God. One second.
I'll be right back.

394
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,110
[Reed] <i>Cool.</i>

395
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,323
[Naomi] Okay. I have to
hold it up, so get--

396
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:52,359
-Are you ready?
<i>-I'm excited beyond belief.</i>

397
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,165
-[gasping] <i>Whoa!</i>
-[Naomi] Isn't that so cool?

398
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,267
<i>I'm going to get boned</i>
<i>out just looking at that.</i>

399
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,935
[laughs]

400
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,538
<i>-That's so cool.</i>
-I mean, the honkers are

401
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,005
a little-- The honkers are
a little bigger than mine,

402
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,373
but a girl can dream, you know?

403
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,008
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

404
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,511
<i>If you don't have dreams,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

405
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,012
I agree. I agree.
Especially at a time like this.

406
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,348
<i>Here's an idea.</i>
<i>You wear that on the date.</i>

407
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:19,052
Oh, my God. People are
gonna think I'm a slut.

408
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,455
<i>Fuck 'em.</i>
[laughs]

409
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,190
Okay, that was a test
and you passed.

410
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,125
Be a slut, do whatever
you want. That's my motto.

411
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,695
Um, I have to do, like,
a happy hour with my cousin.

412
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:28,830
[Reed]
<i>For sure.</i>

413
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,330
Um, but let's chat tomorrow?

414
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:31,599
<i>I'm down. Cool.</i>

415
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,802
Word. All right. Uh, talk
to you soon, Reed. Byeee!

416
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:35,169
<i>See you, Naomi.</i>

417
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:38,038
[line dropped sound]

418
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,708
[Naomi humming softly]

419
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:55,022
Hello, cuz...

420
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:58,959
<i>Hi, darling.</i>
<i>Ah, you look excellent!</i>

421
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,328
I got all zhuzhed up for you.

422
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,666
<i>Stop it.</i>
<i>No, that cleavage. That's--</i>

423
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:05,966
Mm. Mwah--

424
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,234
[Naomi]
Oh, this here?

425
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,803
<i>Excellente.</i>
<i>Give it to them.</i>

426
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,404
<i>Come on. Mm-hmm.</i>

427
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:12,640
Thank you. I've been
eating a lot of cheese.

428
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,642
Do you like this lip?

429
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,977
<i>Sorry. Cheese?</i>

430
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,214
Cheese makes
your boobs bigger. It's milk.

431
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,417
Anyways. Catch me up.
What's going-- What's new?

432
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:28,322
<i>Um, I met this</i>
<i>cute, cute woman.</i>

433
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,190
<i>Like, I'm not</i>
<i>trying to jinx it, okay.</i>

434
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,793
<i>I'm not trying to jinx it.</i>

435
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:35,763
<i>But I think she</i>
<i>could be the one...</i>

436
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,732
Another of the one.

437
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,569
<i>What's your problem?</i>

438
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,671
<i>No, actually, let's talk</i>
<i>about it. What's your problem?</i>

439
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,172
No, I-- that wasn't a hate.

440
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,910
You think every single person
that you meet is the one.

441
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,145
But I actually--
You have such excellent taste

442
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,317
in partners, I see why you
could feel that every single

443
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,186
person that you ever
even mentioned

444
00:16:59,286 --> 00:17:00,889
going on a date with
could be the one.

445
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:02,289
And it's because
you have excellent taste.

446
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,793
That wasn't a dig. It was
more of an acknowledgment.

447
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,294
<i>That was such...</i>

448
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:11,064
<i>a roundabout way</i>
<i>to just chat utter shit.</i>

449
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:13,367
<i>Did you hear the words</i>
<i>as they left your mouth?</i>

450
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,303
<i>Did they make sense</i>
<i>to you as they were leaving?</i>

451
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:21,009
I haven't seen a person in real
life in, like, four months?

452
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,845
Except for,
you know, at the grocery store

453
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:25,580
and obviously the liquor store.

454
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,882
<i>Yeah. I mean,</i>
<i>obviously, these all--</i>

455
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:29,517
<i>These are all Zoom dates.</i>

456
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:32,052
<i>So, I've been going</i>
<i>on, like, loads of, like,</i>

457
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,788
<i>blind Zoom dates.</i>

458
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:36,223
I was really jealous. I thought
you were dating in person.

459
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,091
Um, but I'm
glad that we're all--

460
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,427
We're both in the same boat.
[chuckles]

461
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,596
Suffering.

462
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,731
Um, but I haven't been on

463
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,332
a date yet, per se.

464
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:49,336
But I have been
talking to somebody new.

465
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:53,508
We met on a dating app,
and he's really handsome.

466
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,375
He has really good taste
in music, which I feel

467
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,477
like is pretty rare,
because mine is specific.

468
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,246
But also he's just,
I don't know.

469
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:01,448
He's really kind and
funny and we've been talking--

470
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,250
Like, ever since
I met him we've been talking,

471
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,652
like, pretty much every day.

472
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,521
<i>-Oh, my God. What's his name?</i>
-Yeah.

473
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,889
His name is Reed.

474
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:10,424
<i>Hmph. Okay. Is he white?</i>

475
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,996
<i>Why can't you just settle</i>
<i>down with a nice</i>

476
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,931
-Sadie. Sadie.
<i>-Black guy? You know?</i>

477
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,567
I went to school
in Amherst, Massachusetts.

478
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,803
I don't know what
you guys expect for me.

479
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:24,471
Every single time I talk to
anyone of you, "Is he white?"

480
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:27,474
And is he most of the time?
Sure. But it's also like,

481
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:31,111
I had my sexual awakening
in a very white place.

482
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,948
I just assume
that kind of anyone--

483
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,617
Mm, I was going to say
something--

484
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,819
Ooh, you were
gonna make fun of me.

485
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,252
<i>What were you gonna say?</i>

486
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:45,125
I assume that dudes
who look like they could

487
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,662
be mixed <i>are</i> mixed.

488
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:50,031
Like, I don't give
them the benefit of the doubt,

489
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,633
until proven otherwise.

490
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,836
<i>Wow. Massachusetts</i>
<i>really fucked you up, huh?</i>

491
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,904
[Naomi laughing]

492
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,873
That's actually not fair,
'cause now that I say that

493
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:00,908
out loud, like, people assume
that because I'm light-skinned,

494
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,342
that I have a white parent.

495
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,778
And it's like,
"No, I'm just Cape Verdean.

496
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:05,412
Those are my rapist ancestors."

497
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,247
[slurp]

498
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:08,850
[sighs]

499
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:13,788
Anyway... Um, so Sara's
still out of town.

500
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,025
She is not
really taking

501
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,826
the same considerations
that I am.

502
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,896
She just does
things that I'm just like,

503
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,397
"Why are
you doing these things?"

504
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,833
You know, like,
why are you making the choices

505
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,135
that you're making?

506
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:29,302
Especially during
a pand-- I don't-- What?

507
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:31,438
Okay, so we're
doing the neck roll now?

508
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,008
<i>Listen, I just--</i>
<i>I have aches--</i>

509
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,576
You're so fucking irritating.

510
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:36,878
[doorbell buzzing]

511
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:38,946
Shit. Give me one second.
Doorbell just rang.

512
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:40,682
[sighs]

513
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,417
[footsteps]

514
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,286
Oh, hey. How's it going?
What's up?

515
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,555
[courier]
Oh, you know, same old.

516
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:49,389
Just, uh-- just making
my rounds.

517
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,159
[Naomi] What you, uh,
delivering today?

518
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,894
[courier]
Oh, you know, just, uh...

519
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:54,194
It looks like some groceries.

520
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,228
A few of these discreet ones,

521
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,329
you know what I'm sayin'?

522
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,765
[Naomi]
Discreet ones?

523
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,332
[courier] Yeah, this is
a bunch of dildos.

524
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:02,170
[Naomi] You can tell
when you're delivering a dildo?

525
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,604
[courier]
Nothing else shakes.

526
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,007
[Naomi] That's
actually an excellent point.

527
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,775
Anyway, nice to see you.
I know you busy.

528
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,044
You have a good rest
of your day. Take care.

529
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:12,212
Oh, shoot. Hey!
Hey, hi, um, hi, sorry.

530
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,214
Hey! Hey! How's it going?

531
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,482
[neighbor]
Hey. Hey.

532
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,851
Um, how's the--
how's the baby?

533
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,353
[neighbor]
She's growing like a weed.

534
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,889
Eight-three-quarters weeks.

535
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:25,993
Eight and three quarters
weeks. Wow. Parenthood, huh?

536
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,563
How-- How are you?
They never ask about the dad.

537
00:20:28,663 --> 00:20:30,064
How are you doing?
You gettin' any sleep?

538
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:32,499
[chuckles awkwardly]
Yeah.

539
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,369
This is so weird.

540
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,805
And I'm going to preface
it by just saying

541
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,607
that off the bat.
I apologize in advance.

542
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,776
But can I ask you a question?

543
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,410
I just need a man's
perspective on something,

544
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:44,946
and I have no one.

545
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:47,849
[neighbor]
Yeah.

546
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,818
So, basically I've
been talking to this guy

547
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,520
-on a dating app--
-[neighbor] Uh-huh--

548
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,188
For, like, the duration
of quarantine, right?

549
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,224
And he's really great.
And it's been months

550
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:57,725
and this is,
like, the longest time

551
00:20:57,825 --> 00:20:59,392
that I've ever talked
to someone who I intend

552
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,828
to go on a date with,
without actually going

553
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,530
-on a date with them--
-[neighbor] Uh-huh.

554
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,464
And so we have
decided that we want to meet up

555
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,433
in person, right?
Socially distanced, of course.

556
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,136
Very safe, like,
six feet apart,

557
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,737
maybe at a park
somewhere outside.

558
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,205
Like, the whole shebang.

559
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:14,208
But I know my roommate,
who is not here yet,

560
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,144
but who is gonna
be back sometime soon,

561
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:17,845
I imagine,
is going to be really,

562
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,346
really pissed about that.

563
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,716
Uh, not only from, like,
a coronavirus perspective.

564
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:23,251
Like, she's
worried that I'm gonna go,

565
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,752
get the disease,
bring it back home.

566
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:26,521
We're both gonna have it,
it's gonna be horrible.

567
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,156
We'll get the long
term stuff with the bad lungs

568
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:29,557
and, like, the weird smell.
But then

569
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:31,659
also from, like,
a different perspective

570
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,861
that I don't really want
to bore you with that 'cause

571
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,596
it's even so weird that
I'm having this conversation

572
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:37,430
-with you in the first place--
-[neighbor] Yeah--

573
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,534
--and I'm so sorry again,
but I guess what I'm asking is,

574
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,402
do you think it's fucked up
if I hang out with this dude?

575
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,006
[neighbor] Uh...

576
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,044
How would she know?

577
00:21:53,948 --> 00:21:55,583
[birds squawking]

578
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:58,786
That...
That is an excellent point

579
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,922
that I did not consider.

580
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,391
And thank you so much.

581
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,894
And again,
I'm so sorry about this.

582
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,197
This was so weird.
I apologize for everything

583
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:10,430
and who I am as a person.

584
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,933
Um, have a good
rest of your day.

585
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:14,467
-Uh-huh. Yeah, you too.
-[Naomi] Take care.

586
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,371
[neighbor] Hey, wait.
What's your name?

587
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,241
Oh, right. Buh, duh.

588
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,375
Um, I'm Naomi.
Nice to meet you.

589
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,112
[window dragging]

590
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,517
Sorry. Sorry,
sorry. Sorry, sorry.

591
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,752
Don't be like that, Sadie.

592
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,721
It's not like
I did it on purpose.

593
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,290
<i>Yeah, but you took your sweet</i>
<i>time, didn't ya babe?</i>

594
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,959
I was talking to my neighbor.
He's like--

595
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,595
He's like a cool Brooklyn dad.

596
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:44,866
<i>Okay. But I'm also cool,</i>
<i>and I'm in the UK.</i>

597
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,634
<i>I think</i>
<i>that trumps it, doesn't it?</i>

598
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,102
Don't say Trump around me.

599
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,436
Oh, shit. Sorry.

600
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:53,341
Anyways. I miss,
like, actual New York.

601
00:22:53,975 --> 00:22:55,676
Remember the last
time you came here?

602
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,211
<i>Ugh!</i>

603
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,546
[Naomi] We had so much fun!

604
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:01,215
I actually don't
super remember it.

605
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,750
<i>Obviously.</i>

606
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,518
[laughing]
Do you remember the time--

607
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:06,153
Okay. Do you remember
going to House of Yes

608
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:07,688
the last time you were up?

609
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:10,024
<i>You remember the</i>
<i>woman that stroked my back?</i>

610
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,792
[gasps]
The white woman.

611
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:13,561
She was on
her way to your hair.

612
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:15,529
She was on her way to
your hair. And she said,

613
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,098
"You just look so beautiful."

614
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,633
And we said--

615
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,370
<i>Uh, ma'am.</i>
<i>I know. I'm aware. Thank you.</i>

616
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,272
<i>But I didn't even feel it.</i>

617
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,807
<i>It was you being like,</i>
<i>"Excuse me?"</i>

618
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,343
Well, there's certainly one
thing I'm not going to allow.

619
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,746
And it's white shenanigans.
Not on my watch.

620
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:35,116
<i>Speaking of white shenanigans,</i>

621
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:36,851
<i>what you gonna</i>
<i>do about Sara?</i>

622
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,255
I don't know.

623
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:43,557
It feels so bad to be critical
of someone who has, like,

624
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:44,892
been there for me.

625
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,395
I think that being
alone for so long,

626
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:48,963
specifically without her,

627
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:52,967
has really given me the time
to reflect and be like...

628
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:56,270
do I even miss her that much?

629
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,471
And, like,
of course I miss her.

630
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:02,610
I love her so much.
But it's never-- I don't know.

631
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,079
It's never anything,
like, malicious or,

632
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:06,414
like, mean or bad.

633
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:07,715
Like, I don't
think she's a bad person.

634
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:10,151
It's just, like,
little things, you know?

635
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,485
<i>Yeah, but those little things,</i>
<i>they add up.</i>

636
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,454
<i>And, I mean,</i>
<i>did you even hear, like,</i>

637
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,957
<i>the way you were just talking?</i>

638
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,925
<i>Like, you say one</i>
<i>little thing about her,</i>

639
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,927
<i>and then you have to follow</i>
<i>it up with, you know,</i>

640
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,229
<i>"I love her so much. Like,</i>
<i>I can't wait 'til she's--"</i>

641
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,065
<i>Like, come on!</i>

642
00:24:24,165 --> 00:24:27,735
<i>It feels like you're policing</i>
<i>and self-checking yourself.</i>

643
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:30,371
<i>Like, she doesn't</i>
<i>necessarily have to sit</i>

644
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,273
<i>in your mind as a bad person.</i>

645
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:35,910
<i>It's just,</i>
<i>"Have I outgrown her?</i>

646
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,212
<i>Have I outgrown</i>
<i>this friendship?"</i>

647
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,449
<i>Is it one-sided at the minute?</i>

648
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,085
<i>And are you okay with that?</i>

649
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:48,522
[sighs]

650
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,658
Yeah, you're right.

651
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,562
I-- It's just hard.

652
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,697
You know? I've been
friends with her for so long.

653
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,202
And yes, I said
you were right. Okay?

654
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:05,406
Write it down. Report it.
Post it to Facebook.

655
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:09,010

1141
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:13,807
[phone ringing]

1142
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,715
Hello-- Ooh. Girl.
[laughs]

1143
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:23,317
<i>-Oh! Ah, are we drinkin'?</i>
<i>-Yeah. Oh--</i>

1144
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,818
-Oh!
-[laughter]

1145
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,221
<i>-Hey. Hoo.</i>
-[Naomi] Cheers, y'all!

1146
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,189
-[excited chatter]
<i>-Hey y'all.</i>

1147
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,626
[Naomi]
Look at us. What's up?

1148
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:33,093
<i>I somehow thought that you--</i>

1149
00:46:33,193 --> 00:46:34,763
<i>You were gonna</i>
<i>ignore that we were--</i>

1150
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:36,430
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I sent the Zoom request--</i>

1151
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:38,299
<i>-I was close, but...</i>
<i>-Yeah, I felt you weren't--</i>

1152
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,867
<i>'Cause you didn't</i>
<i>respond to the text messages.</i>

1153
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,703
[laughs]
<i>I had to put on a shirt!</i>

1154
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:42,870
To respond to texts?

1155
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,238
<i>Mentally, yeah.</i>

1156
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:46,140
<i>-It's a state of mind.</i>
-[laughter]

1157
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,576
I will say that I am desperate
for human contact right now,

1158
00:46:48,677 --> 00:46:50,210
so I am
thrilled that you called--

1159
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:53,548
<i>I'll take what I can get.</i>
<i>Um, I have a reason.</i>

1160
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:57,151
<i>So. Okay, I saw online,</i>
<i>on Twitter, whatever,</i>

1161
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,622
<i>that apparently</i>
<i>Carson Wentz is mixed.</i>

1162
00:47:00,722 --> 00:47:02,757
<i>You know who he is? So,</i>
<i>he's a Eagles football player.</i>

1163
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,425
<i>So, I look into this, right?</i>

1164
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:06,226
<i>The tweet disappears 'cause</i>
<i>you know how Twitter be.</i>

1165
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,128
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>that I had misread</i>

1166
00:47:08,228 --> 00:47:10,431
<i>and that wasn't true at all.</i>
<i>Or I just can't read.</i>

1167
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:14,803
<i>Actually, it turns</i>
<i>out Pete Wentz is Black.</i>

1168
00:47:14,902 --> 00:47:17,971
<i>Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy!</i>

1169
00:47:18,072 --> 00:47:19,873
<i>Did you know this?</i>

1170
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:22,009
He's half-Jamaican.

1171
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,645
<i>That story had so many</i>
<i>turns in it.</i>

1172
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:25,079
<i>Are you guys</i>
<i>just being pretentious</i>

1173
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:27,014
<i>or did you actually know this?</i>
<i>'Cause--</i>

1174
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:29,183
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>I have crazy news. Wait.</i>

1175
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:32,853
<i>Did you know that Mariah Carey</i>
<i>is half-Black?</i>

1176
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:34,388
<i>See, Khadijah,</i>
<i>that's why a little bit,</i>

1177
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:36,256
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"I hope she doesn't answer,"</i>

1178
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:37,958
<i>'cause I knew she's gonna</i>
<i>say some smart-ass shit.</i>

1179
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:39,426
[all laughing]

1180
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:40,961
<i>That's why. That's--</i>

1181
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:42,363
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to be disrespectful to me.</i>

1182
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:44,231
<i>I just came</i>
<i>here with some words</i>

1183
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:47,468
<i>-to share with my friends--</i>
<i>-I can't-- I cannot.</i>

1184
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:49,103
<i>It was a shocker</i>
<i>because when I thought</i>

1185
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:50,805
<i>about the music</i>
<i>and then him, I said,</i>

1186
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:52,507
<i>"Girl, why didn't</i>
<i>you think that before?"</i>

1187
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,375
<i>That's what I'm saying,</i>
<i>so I wanted to share that.</i>

1188
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:56,243
<i>I should've called my white</i>
<i>friends. That's what</i>

1189
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:58,212
<i>I should've done 'cause they</i>
<i>would've been like, "Oh,</i>

1190
00:47:58,312 --> 00:47:59,714
<i>you always tell us somethin'</i>
<i>we didn't know."</i>

1191
00:47:59,814 --> 00:48:00,981
<i>You just, "I should've</i>

1192
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,349
<i>called my white</i>
<i>friends"-ed us.</i>

1193
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,184
<i>I oughtta kick you</i>
<i>out the zoo.</i>

1194
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:06,220
I feel like, okay, you have to
take into consideration

1195
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,055
the current political climate.
Like,

1196
00:48:08,155 --> 00:48:09,791
-are they gonna to be, like,
<i>-Don't bring that in.</i>

1197
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,426
actually thrilled to be like,
"Oh, my God, Pete Wentz, yeah,

1198
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,562
half-Black." Or are they just,
like, patronizing you?

1199
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:16,130
<i>You know what? How are y'all?</i>

1200
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,898
<i>-How are you doing?</i>
-[laughter]

1201
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:20,535
We're doin' okay. I'm okay.
Wait, you guys taking

1202
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:23,203
care of yourselves?
I miss you. This is horrible.

1203
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:26,006
<i>On a scale of, like,</i>
<i>one to 10,</i>

1204
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:29,009
<i>I'd say I'm doing six,</i>
<i>which is good considering--</i>

1205
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:30,512
That's like pandemic good.

1206
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:31,912
<i>Yeah. I think that's really,</i>

1207
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:33,548
<i>really good. It-- It--</i>

1208
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,583
What are the protests
like in L.A. right now?

1209
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:40,220
<i>Uh, you know, I went to</i>
<i>one and, um, it is definitely</i>

1210
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,156
<i>a mix of people</i>
<i>who are there,</i>

1211
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:44,458
<i>who really care, you know?</i>

1212
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,294
<i>People who are really trying</i>
<i>to be a part of the change.</i>

1213
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:49,564
<i>And then you have people</i>
<i>who are definitely</i>

1214
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:51,699
<i>there because they need</i>
<i>to take some pictures.</i>

1215
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,902
<i>So, it's really sifting</i>
<i>through that. We actually,</i>

1216
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:57,070
<i>um, you know,</i>
<i>went to one, me and Khadijah,</i>

1217
00:48:57,171 --> 00:48:59,239
<i>where it actually wound up</i>

1218
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,442
<i>being a music video</i>
<i>instead of just a protest.</i>

1219
00:49:01,543 --> 00:49:02,844
<i>So, that was really...</i>

1220
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:04,945
<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>I'll never forget--</i>

1221
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,346
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1222
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,148
<i>She got on the mic,</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>

1223
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:09,884
<i>"All right, here we go. Like--</i>

1224
00:49:09,983 --> 00:49:11,653
-[Lyssa] <i>Yeah--</i>
<i>-People are gonna speak from</i>

1225
00:49:11,753 --> 00:49:13,987
<i>their heart. And then she</i>
<i>started singing, I think,</i>

1226
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:17,257
<i>"We Are the World"</i>
<i>by Michael Jackson.</i>

1227
00:49:17,357 --> 00:49:19,661
<i>And then that folded</i>
<i>into a Whitney Houston song.</i>

1228
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:23,030
<i>And then that folded</i>
<i>into "Fly Like an Eagle."</i>

1229
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,332
<i>And then that folded into--</i>
<i>She just wanted to sing!</i>

1230
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:27,234
[Lyssa] <i>And then remember that</i>
<i>one girl that wouldn't wear</i>

1231
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:29,102
<i>a mask and she was</i>
<i>over there being cute.</i>

1232
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:31,338
<i>Like, "Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Why do I need to wear a mask?</i>

1233
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,808
<i>Um, like, I'm just</i>
<i>at a protest with a bunch</i>

1234
00:49:33,908 --> 00:49:36,176
<i>of Black people who are</i>
<i>the most marginalized group</i>

1235
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:38,278
<i>here during this pandemic."</i>

1236
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:40,147
<i>She to me was like,</i>
<i>"Basically, you should just</i>

1237
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:41,549
<i>be happy that I'm out here."</i>

1238
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:43,183
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"You could go home."</i>

1239
00:49:43,283 --> 00:49:44,886
<i>And her and all</i>
<i>her friends were like,</i>

1240
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,019
<i>"Put on your mask, it's okay."</i>

1241
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,354
<i>And she was like, "Fine."</i>

1242
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:48,790
<i>So, that's the climate in L.A.</i>

1243
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,257
<i>What's it like there?</i>

1244
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:52,092
Now I feel like I'm
bragging 'cause I went

1245
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:53,795
to a protest and, like, the
only issue I had with it is,

1246
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:56,129
I mean, obviously, A, the
police were just beatin' people

1247
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,932
-up with reckless abandon.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1248
00:49:58,031 --> 00:50:02,002
And B, it was like,
um, I was alone, you know?

1249
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,605
Like, my roommate
is still in Florida.

1250
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:05,907
So, I was just, like, by
myself. But also, I don't know.

1251
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,842
I was watching
people get, like,

1252
00:50:07,942 --> 00:50:09,343
batoned and
pushed over by the cops.

1253
00:50:09,443 --> 00:50:11,078
And, like, random people
who didn't even know them

1254
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,146
coming and, like, scooping
them up and helping them.

1255
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:14,616
And, like, asking
if they need water

1256
00:50:14,716 --> 00:50:16,049
and asking if
they need, like, medical care.

1257
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:17,351
It was really beautiful.

1258
00:50:17,451 --> 00:50:19,152
New York comes
together when it has to.

1259
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:20,889
And everyone
was wearing a mask.

1260
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:23,791
<i>I wish you weren't by</i>
<i>yourself. That's scary to me.</i>

1261
00:50:23,892 --> 00:50:26,159
Yeah, it's weird.
It's been... Nice.

1262
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,461
<i>Oh, that face.</i>

1263
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:28,963
Y'all mind if
I pop off real fast?

1264
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:31,131
Y'all mind if
I pop off real fast?

1265
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,734
<i>Honey, welcome</i>
<i>to the Red table.</i>

1266
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,636
<i>I can't!</i>

1267
00:50:34,736 --> 00:50:36,169
[laughter]

1268
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,071
<i>What's on your mind,</i>
<i>girlfriend?</i>

1269
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:40,542
Okay, so, um...

1270
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,076
So, she's been gone
and I miss her, obviously.

1271
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:44,546
She's my best
friend in the whole world.

1272
00:50:44,646 --> 00:50:47,047
And, like, I've known
her for so long but she--

1273
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:48,750
[sighs]
I've been talking to this guy--

1274
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,618
<i>Yeah, you said. You told</i>
<i>us about the other day--</i>

1275
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:52,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Reed.
We still are talking.

1276
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,156
And he's, like, great.

1277
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:57,959
<i>So, what's the deal?</i>
<i>Are you guys gonna, like,</i>

1278
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,827
<i>meet up soon?</i>

1279
00:50:59,928 --> 00:51:01,529
We-- Okay.
We talked last night.

1280
00:51:01,629 --> 00:51:05,332
And we made kind of a solid
plan to hang out, right?

1281
00:51:05,432 --> 00:51:08,235
I was really excited.
Feeling myself.

1282
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:10,437
And then right
before I went to bed,

1283
00:51:10,538 --> 00:51:13,407
I got a text from Sara.
"I'm coming back on Friday."

1284
00:51:13,508 --> 00:51:16,410
<i>In two days on Friday. She's</i>
<i>giving you two days notice?</i>

1285
00:51:16,511 --> 00:51:18,012
Yeah, she told
me this Wednesday.

1286
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:20,280
And, like, Sara
and I had plans to have

1287
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,684
this big elaborate,
like, welcome back dinner,

1288
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:25,720
which I assume is going
to take place on Friday night

1289
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,522
'cause that's when
she would be coming back.

1290
00:51:27,622 --> 00:51:29,958
Do you think I should
reschedule with Reed

1291
00:51:30,058 --> 00:51:31,391
and just save
myself the headache

1292
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,061
of her being pissed about it?

1293
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,896
Or what? What do I do?
Like, I--

1294
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:37,364
<i>Did you just</i>
<i>hear yourself talk!?</i>

1295
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,668
<i>I'm not even gon' say nothin'</i>

1296
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:43,136
<i>because let me tell</i>
<i>you something, Naomi.</i>

1297
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:44,973
<i>Like, I know</i>
<i>that's your friend and all</i>

1298
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:52,179
<i>but, like... Like, I don't--</i>
<i>Like, I just feel like...</i>

1299
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:56,283
<i>You know, that girl's</i>
<i>not my type of people.</i>

1300
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:58,218
<i>I'mma just say that. Can I--</i>

1301
00:51:58,318 --> 00:51:59,887
<i>'Cause I feel like</i>
<i>I shouldn't say that much</i>

1302
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:01,355
<i>because I...</i>

1303
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,091
<i>Lyssa doesn't</i>
<i>want to say that much.</i>

1304
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:04,859
<i>And Lyssa doesn't</i>
<i>have to say that much.</i>

1305
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:07,095
<i>So, I will say it.</i>
<i>She stinks!</i>

1306
00:52:07,194 --> 00:52:10,565
<i>Every time you talk about her,</i>
<i>there's some sort of problem.</i>

1307
00:52:10,665 --> 00:52:12,800
<i>-Not stinks--</i>
<i>-She stinks, man!</i>

1308
00:52:13,835 --> 00:52:16,771
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

1309
00:52:16,871 --> 00:52:19,941
<i>Well, I'mma-- I'm gonna</i>
<i>piggyback off of what--</i>

1310
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:22,110
It's all in
the open now, let's just--

1311
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:23,511
<i>Yeah, I mean-- I-- 'Cause we--</i>

1312
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,879
<i>Me and Khadijah</i>
<i>talked about this--</i>

1313
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:26,547
<i>Popcorn. Pop to Lyssa.</i>

1314
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:28,650
<i>We've talked about</i>
<i>this before, me and Khadijah.</i>

1315
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,752
<i>And you are our friend so we</i>
<i>don't want to talk about,</i>

1316
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:34,589
<i>you know, like, your friend.</i>
<i>But I just want to say to you,</i>

1317
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:37,892
<i>you know, you don't have</i>
<i>to stay friends with someone</i>

1318
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:39,393
<i>just because you're</i>
<i>friends with someone.</i>

1319
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:42,664
<i>You don't</i> have <i>to do that.</i>

1320
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,398
[Khadijah]
<i>Oop.</i>

1321
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:45,900
[Lyssa]
<i>I'm just sayin'--</i>

1322
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,801
Why you always
gotta say something

1323
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:48,803
that cuts so deep?

1324
00:52:48,903 --> 00:52:52,439
<i>I don't like Sara,</i>
<i>really, if I can be honest.</i>

1325
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,408
<i>Like, well,</i>
<i>as a person, it's not--</i>

1326
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,309
<i>It's just like, she just--</i>
<i>Every time you bring her up,</i>

1327
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,245
<i>it's always stuff like this.</i>

1328
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:02,150
<i>Like, she's so, just</i>
<i>exhausting and time-consuming.</i>

1329
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:05,485
<i>Like, you need</i>
<i>to put rules on some</i>

1330
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:08,556
<i>of your friendships,</i>
<i>too, if that makes sense.</i>

1331
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:12,126
<i>Like, she can't just</i>
<i>keep ruining your schedule</i>

1332
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:14,227
<i>and taking up</i>
<i>your space and your energy</i>

1333
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,630
<i>and controlling</i>
<i>your life. Like,</i>

1334
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,364
<i>we would talk about</i>
<i>a guy like this</i>

1335
00:53:17,464 --> 00:53:19,100
<i>and be like,</i>
<i>"Who does he think he is?"</i>

1336
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:20,968
<i>And you also</i>
<i>should be able to feel safe</i>

1337
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:23,370
<i>telling her that,</i>
<i>"Hey, girl,</i>

1338
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:26,074
<i>um, I'm hanging</i>
<i>out with this guy I just met."</i>

1339
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,308
<i>Because if you told one</i>
<i>of us that, we would be like,</i>

1340
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:30,511
<i>"Oh, girl,</i>
<i>go get you some dick."</i>

1341
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:33,181
<i>But she really</i>
<i>wants to consume</i>

1342
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,149
<i>all of your time and space.</i>

1343
00:53:35,248 --> 00:53:37,051
<i>And those are all</i>
<i>of my words that lead</i>

1344
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:39,252
<i>into Khadijah's</i>
<i>point which is--</i>

1345
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:40,855
[exaggerated Italian accent]
<i>Ah, she a-stink!</i>

1346
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:42,190
[laughs]
I just--

1347
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:44,391
I get where
you guys are coming from.

1348
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:48,696
And how do you let
go of something that has

1349
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:52,399
been so good
to you for so many years?

1350
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:54,635
Or how do you even
come to terms that maybe--

1351
00:53:54,736 --> 00:53:56,403
With the fact that,
like, maybe it hasn't been

1352
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,005
that good for
you for that many--

1353
00:53:58,106 --> 00:53:59,607
I don't--

1354
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:01,642
-[Naomi groaning]
<i>-I think it's the latter.</i>

1355
00:54:01,743 --> 00:54:03,678
<i>It's soundin' a lot</i>
<i>more like the latter.</i>

1356
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:05,747
<i>If you keep trying,</i>
<i>trying, trying, right?</i>

1357
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:08,583
<i>It's like you're</i>
<i>two glasses of water--</i>

1358
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:11,018
<i>Follow me-- Right?</i>
<i>And that's friendship, right?</i>

1359
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,653
[Naomi]
I'm here. I'm here--

1360
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:14,756
<i>You fill-- You help</i>
<i>fill each other up, right?</i>

1361
00:54:14,856 --> 00:54:17,290
<i>But if there's</i>
<i>a hole in the other glass</i>

1362
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,660
<i>and you keep filling,</i>
<i>filling, filling,</i>

1363
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:21,763
<i>that glass is sucking</i>
<i>everything out.</i>

1364
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:24,464
<i>There's nothing left</i>
<i>to give back to you.</i>

1365
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,200
<i>-You know what I mean?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1366
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,702
-[Khadijah, indistinct]
-That was beautiful.

1367
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:29,369
<i>-When you do metaphors--</i>
-That was beautiful--

1368
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:30,805
<i>-- you're like...</i>

1369
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:32,573
<i>I be tryin'.</i>
<i>I be tryin', you know?</i>

1370
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:34,407
Sometimes I'm like,
I know you got a comm degree,

1371
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:36,409
but you could have also
double-minored in philosophy.

1372
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,879
-You know what I mean?
<i>-I don't really think</i>

1373
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:40,248
<i>I could have,</i>
<i>'cause all my metaphors,</i>

1374
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:42,750
<i>they start with glasses.</i>
<i>It's just--</i>

1375
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,451
<i>-No.</i>
-[laughs]

1376
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:46,254
<i>If you start a metaphor</i>
<i>with a glass or two of water,</i>

1377
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:47,922
<i>you'll find</i>
<i>your way to the end.</i>

1378
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:51,391
<i>I just think that right now,</i>
<i>you can just, like,</i>

1379
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:53,594
<i>cut out the fat</i>
<i>because the fat</i>

1380
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:57,497
<i>is not really helpful</i>
<i>moving forward.</i>

1381
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:59,567
<i>Part of the reason I call</i>
<i>you guys is because I can</i>

1382
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:01,736
<i>trust you guys</i>
<i>and I love you guys.</i>

1383
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:03,237
<i>And I don't</i>
<i>really have too much space</i>

1384
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:04,972
<i>for anything else.</i>

1385
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,674
<i>Look at the world right now.</i>

1386
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:09,043
<i>How much space</i>
<i>and time do you have,</i>

1387
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:10,745
<i>for people who are not...</i>

1388
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:12,947
<i>helping you, like--</i>

1389
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:15,116
I get it.
And you know what?

1390
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:18,351
<i>I'm gonna take what</i>
<i>y'all said into consideration.</i>

1391
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:21,354
[gasps] <i>We got to</i>
<i>consideration, what an honor.</i>

1392
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:22,890
Next time. De--
Definitely next time.

1393
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,392
Like, this time, I'm
for sure gonna have to just,

1394
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:29,230
bite the bullet
and, like, reschedule my shit

1395
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:30,932
'cause I'm not
mentally prepared to deal--

1396
00:55:31,032 --> 00:55:34,334
<i>We spent all this time</i>
<i>for you to not listen to us?</i>

1397
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:38,239
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>No. I didn't sign up for that.</i>

1398
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:39,339
<i>Naomi!</i>

1399
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,542
Listen. Personal growth is--

1400
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:43,010
It's not a marathon.

1401
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,112
-Well, it is--
<i>-It is--</i>

1402
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:48,082
Personal growth is a marathon.
It's not a sprint. Okay?

1403
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,449
Can you give me
a frickin' break?

1404
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:50,985
<i>You said--</i>
<i>You said the wrong thing</i>

1405
00:55:51,085 --> 00:55:52,820
<i>because you know you're wrong!</i>
<i>Sprint it!</i>

1406
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,757
<i>Take a performance-enhancing</i>
<i>drug and run, kid!</i>

1407
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:58,893
Maybe this is,
like, the one last time

1408
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:01,095
that I just reschedule so
I don't have to deal with it.

1409
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:03,731
And then in a couple days,
we can have this conversation

1410
00:56:03,831 --> 00:56:06,167
and I'll move out, or I'll do
whatever I have to do.

1411
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:07,568
-And we can just--
<i>-No, no, no.</i>

1412
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,604
<i>Because it's not</i>
<i>gonna be the last time.</i>

1413
00:56:09,704 --> 00:56:11,438
<i>You have to just</i>
<i>rip the Band-Aid off.</i>

1414
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:13,241
<i>You are trying</i>
<i>to peel it off slowly</i>

1415
00:56:13,341 --> 00:56:15,042
<i>and you've been</i>
<i>doing that for a really</i>

1416
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:17,778
<i>long time with this girl.</i>
<i>Once again, I don't know her.</i>

1417
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:19,446
<i>But I don't</i>
<i>really like her like that.</i>

1418
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:21,315
<i>So, I would love</i>
<i>to not be stressed out</i>

1419
00:56:21,414 --> 00:56:23,985
<i>by the conversation</i>
<i>about her, you know?</i>

1420
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:25,853
-[Lyssa speaking indistinctly]
<i>-Yeah, I wanna</i>

1421
00:56:25,953 --> 00:56:28,455
<i>have stressful conversations</i>
<i>about, like, Reed texts.</i>

1422
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:30,791
<i>Let's do that instead.</i>
<i>That seems so much more fun.</i>

1423
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:32,326
<i>I want--</i>
<i>I wanted to talk about how</i>

1424
00:56:32,425 --> 00:56:33,728
<i>Pete Wentz was mixed.</i>

1425
00:56:33,828 --> 00:56:35,596
<i>And here we are</i>
<i>talking about Sara.</i>

1426
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:38,633
<i>Lyssa, I got one for you.</i>
<i>Vin Diesel's Black.</i>

1427
00:56:39,267 --> 00:56:40,868
<i>Is she lyin'?</i>

1428
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:42,069
<i>Lemme look this up.</i>

1429
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:43,237
Lyssa. Lyssa.

1430
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:44,639
[Khadijah laughing]

1431
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,540
<i>-Wait, are y'all serious?</i>
-What?

1432
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:48,542
-[Khadijah] <i>Vin Diesel's Black.</i>
-To me, Barney was Black.

1433
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:51,444
And also Arthur
from the TV show, <i>Arthur.</i>

1434
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:54,447
The Brain is also Black.
The Brain celebrates Kwanzaa.

1435
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:56,751
I actually think everyone in--

1436
00:56:56,851 --> 00:56:58,619
in the Arthur Universe
is Black,

1437
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,453
except for Binky,
who is Dominican.

1438
00:57:00,554 --> 00:57:03,024
<i>Binky is Dominican</i>
<i>or Cape Verdean.</i>

1439
00:57:03,124 --> 00:57:05,293
Okay, let's take it easy.

1440
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:06,794
[Khadijah]
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

1441
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:09,063
<i>but Binky is high</i>
<i>yellow Cape Verdean.</i>

1442
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:12,967
<i>That's why he's yellow.</i>
<i>'Cause Binky's high yellow!</i>

1443
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:15,569
Wow!

1444
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,605
<i>Did you guys know Kimora</i>
<i>Lee Simmons was half-Black--</i>

1445
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:19,340
<i>I can't really have fun</i>
<i>on my own, can't I?</i>

1446
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:20,741
-Lyssa.
<i>-We gotta let--</i>

[crosstalk]

1448
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:25,146
I'm gonna duck out before
she realizes that Barack Obama

1449
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,114
is Black.
I love you both--

1450

<i>-Hey, what?</i>

I will do my best

it, but also if I summon

1478
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,955

then I guess we'll just chill.

1491
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:11,652

<i>"Okay, that's kind of weird,</i>

Um, literally right after

1509
00:59:48,656 --> 00:59:50,925
we made solid plans last night,

1510
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:52,893
Sara texted me
and was like,

1511
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:55,530
she's coming back tomorrow.

1512
00:59:55,629 --> 00:59:57,465
And we have
been talking for, like,

1513
00:59:57,566 --> 00:59:59,467
a couple of days
about when she gets back,

1514
00:59:59,568 --> 01:00:01,135
we were going to do
this whole elaborate

1515
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:03,337
welcome back dinner.
I'm going to go to the Co-op.

1516
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:04,638
I'm going to get groceries.

1517
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:08,109
And let's say...

1518
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,612
it seems like the time

1519
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:13,914
that we would be
doing that would be

1520
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:16,817
dinner time tomorrow,
which also seems, like,

1521
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,587
maybe the time
that we would be hanging.

1522
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:20,154
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-And I thought like,

1523
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:22,456
"Oh, maybe I could--
We could do, like, a day hang.

1524
01:00:22,557 --> 01:00:23,924
And then
I could, like, you know,

1525
01:00:24,024 --> 01:00:25,527
have the welcome back
dinner in the evening.

1526
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:27,862
But it's like,
what if our day hang turns

1527
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:29,630
into and evening hang,
you know?

1528
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,432
So, I'd rather just hang out
on a day that we have,

1529
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:33,234
like, all the time
in the world.

1530
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:37,037
Um, and I also don't want
to deal with her

1531
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:39,640

aggressive towards me.

1532
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,611

<i>be angry about that?</i>

<i>Like, us hanging out?</i>

1534
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,779
No, she's not--
She wouldn't be mad.

1535
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,148
Like, mad is the wrong word.
It's just like,

1536
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:50,985
I just don't feel
like dealing with that.

1537
01:00:51,085 --> 01:00:52,853
And I also don't
want her to have to deal

1538
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,623

like, months of being away.

1541

And I also just-- I don't--

1542
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:03,998

walked on eggshells in...

1543

1544
01:01:07,168 --> 01:01:09,436
It's, like, not that I don't
know which eggshells

1545

I've been walking on eggshells

1546
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:13,508
for our whole friendship.
And I know where to put

1547
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:15,743
my feet. Right? Like, there's
some quail shells, right?

1548
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:17,378
They're, like, feeble,
they're weak, they shatter.

1549
01:01:17,478 --> 01:01:19,847
There is, on the other
hand, like, an emu shell,

1550
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:21,315
an ostrich shell,
like, it's thicker.

1551
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:23,150

step there to avoid, like--

1613
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:19,527
<i>And it could actually</i>
<i>be, like, a quarter white.</i>

1614
01:04:19,627 --> 01:04:22,162
<i>I'm not totally sure</i>
<i>how to broach that topic.</i>

1615
01:04:22,262 --> 01:04:25,199
<i>I'm gonna lose my mind.</i>
<i>I'm so excited!</i>

1616
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:27,101
<i>I never get</i>
<i>to do spontaneous shit</i>

1617
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,969
<i>like this when Sara's here.</i>

1618
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:31,506
[phone ringing]

1619
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:34,875
<i>Well, look who it is.</i>

1620
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:37,044
[beep]

1621
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:40,648
-Hey, what's up?
<i>-Hey, nothin'...</i>

1622
01:04:40,749 --> 01:04:42,550
How's it going?
Best friend says what?

1623
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:44,218
<i>-What?</i>
-[both laughing]

1624
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,555
<i>-You look good.</i>
-Thank you.

1625
01:04:47,655 --> 01:04:51,593
I figured I'd zhuzh
myself up for myself tonight,

1626
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:52,960
you know.

1627
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:58,265
<i>Yeah. Well, okay,</i>
<i>so I-- I've been thinking</i>

1628
01:04:58,365 --> 01:05:02,302
<i>about it and I feel</i>
<i>really uncomfortable with...</i>

1629
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,840
<i>you having</i>
<i>a date in our apartment.</i>

1630
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:08,475
<i>And I'm-- I'm</i>
<i>just, like, panicked. Like--</i>

1631
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:10,545
Sara, I'm-- First of all,

1632
01:05:10,978 --> 01:05:13,113
not having
a date at the apartment.

1633
01:05:13,213 --> 01:05:14,481
Like, he's not coming here.

1634
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:16,651
If we go on
a date when we reschedule,

1635
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,686
it's going to be outside. Like,

1636
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,388
I don't want
you to worry about that,

1637
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:22,489
you know, like...

1638
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,191
<i>But if you're outside</i>

1639
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:26,393
<i>and then you go inside</i>
<i>and then you, like,</i>

1640
01:05:26,493 --> 01:05:28,395
<i>touch our stuff, I feel like</i>
<i>you're not taking</i>

1641
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:31,231
<i>it seriously. And, like,</i>
<i>it feels like you don't even</i>

1642
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,333
<i>care that I could</i>
<i>get it from this.</i>

1643
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:35,770
<i>What?</i>

1644
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:37,404
Are you being
serious right now?

1645
01:05:37,505 --> 01:05:39,239
<i>Of course I'm being serious.</i>
<i>I'm freaked out.</i>

1646
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:42,577
You just said that I'm
not taking it seriously, Sara?

1647
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:46,681
I stayed in
New York City through, like,

1648
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:48,248
the worst of this pandem--

1649
01:05:48,348 --> 01:05:50,217
Like, you weren't here
for the refrigerator trucks

1650
01:05:50,317 --> 01:05:51,853
full of dead bodies outside.

1651
01:05:51,952 --> 01:05:53,788
You weren't--
Like, the woman at the YMCA

1652
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:55,255
down the street fucking died.

1653
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:56,957
She caught
coronavirus and died.

1654
01:05:57,057 --> 01:05:58,526
You know the relationship
I have with that woman.

1655
01:05:58,626 --> 01:06:00,829
She's so kind. Like,
to say that I'm not taking

1656
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:03,263
it seriously is, like, pretty
fucked because I'm witnessing

1657
01:06:03,363 --> 01:06:05,934
the death and destruction
and just chaos all around me.

1658
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,735
And for you
to say that of all people,

1659
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:10,170
someone who was, like,
literally going out in Florida

1660
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,473
of all places,
to the bars, not wearing masks

1661
01:06:12,574 --> 01:06:14,174
with your friends,
just partying all night,

1662
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:15,910
getting drunk to the point
where you don't even

1663
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:17,177
remember what
you were drinking--

1664
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:19,514
To say that I'm not
taking this pandemic seriously

1665
01:06:19,614 --> 01:06:22,049
is like, a little bit rich,
you know what I mean?

1666
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:24,318
Not to be rude,
but, like, come on now.

1667
01:06:24,418 --> 01:06:26,420
<i>'Kay, I went</i>
<i>to a bar one fucking time.</i>

1668
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:29,757
<i>And I'm sorry</i>
<i>I haven't been in New York</i>

1669
01:06:29,858 --> 01:06:33,427
<i>but I had to be with</i>
<i>my family, it's my family.</i>

1670
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,362
<i>-I'm sorry. I do-- I--</i>
-That's not what I'm saying.

1671
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:37,197
And you don't have
to apologize for that.

1672
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:40,033
It's just, like,
I really don't appreciate--

1673
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:41,669
<i>It's not my fault</i>
<i>people are dying.</i>

1674
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:44,104
<i>It's not my fault</i>
<i>that it's so fucking scary.</i>

1675
01:06:44,204 --> 01:06:45,974
<i>And I'm sorry</i>
<i>I don't know what it's like</i>

1676
01:06:46,073 --> 01:06:47,842
<i>but I'm doing</i>
<i>my own thing here.</i>

1677
01:06:47,942 --> 01:06:49,544
<i>Things aren't good here.</i>

1678
01:06:49,644 --> 01:06:51,111
They're not good there.

1679
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:52,680
And that's why I don't
understand why you would say

1680
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,314
that I'm not taking it
seriously when you're going

1681
01:06:54,414 --> 01:06:56,283
out in a place
that you admit is not good.

1682
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,919
It doesn't make any sense.

1683
01:06:58,018 --> 01:07:00,053
You're being such
a hypocrite right now.

1684
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:02,256
[stutters]
<i>I don't understand,</i>

1685
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:04,124
<i>like, why you're</i>
<i>yelling at me?</i>

1686
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:05,760
<i>I-- This doesn't make</i>
<i>any fucking sense. Like--</i>

1687
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,194
I'm not yelling.
It's just like--

1688
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:09,196
<i>You are yelling.</i>
<i>You're yelling at me.</i>

1689
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:11,866
<i>And it's like, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You're my one fucking friend.</i>

1690
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,635
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

1691
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:16,604
Sara.

1692
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:18,105
<i>-What?</i>
-Sara.

1693
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:20,440
[exhales forcefully]

1694
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:26,514
Have you considered that
this is not about coronavirus?

1695
01:07:26,614 --> 01:07:28,783
Like, this is not
about the pandemic, right?

1696
01:07:28,883 --> 01:07:30,685
Because you obviously
don't care about the pandemic

1697
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:32,319
if you're gonna go
out raging with your friends

1698
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:34,121
at a bar in one
of the hot spots--

1699
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:35,723
<i>-It was one time!</i>
-Let me finish. Let me finish.

1700
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:37,157
It was more than one time.

1701
01:07:37,257 --> 01:07:38,760
And you know that 'cause
I'm on your close friends

1702
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,160
on your stories on Instagram.

1703
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,629
So, like, why are
you lying to me about this

1704
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:43,363
when you know that I know
what the truth is, right?

1705
01:07:43,463 --> 01:07:45,332
Have you considered
that maybe you just don't

1706
01:07:45,432 --> 01:07:47,602
like when I do things that
maybe could not involve you?

1707
01:07:47,702 --> 01:07:49,403
Have you considered
that maybe the idea

1708
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,438
of me dating this guy
means that you're not

1709
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,307
going to be up my
ass all the fucking time?

1710
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,809
And we're gonna
spend every second

1711
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,143
of our lives together?

1712
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,779
And that's been
the way that it has been

1713
01:07:57,879 --> 01:07:59,413
since we've known each
other for our whole friendship?

1714
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:01,716
And you are terribly
afraid of that happening?

1715
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:04,852
I think you're being kind of
a bitch about this whole thing.

1716
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:06,286
Sorry. I'm not
trying to be mean.

1717
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:07,956
And I realize that saying
the word "bitch" is,

1718
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:09,591
like, mean. And you're my best
friend in the whole world.

1719
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:11,391
But, like, think
a little bit deeper.

1720
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:13,595
I think you're being kind
of fucked up to me about this.

1721
01:08:15,663 --> 01:08:18,766
<i>So, you think I'm just</i>
<i>in your shadow all the time?</i>

1722
01:08:18,866 --> 01:08:20,568
<i>You think I'm just</i>
<i>trying to hang out with you,</i>

1723
01:08:20,668 --> 01:08:22,336
<i>and you don't even</i>
<i>want to hang out with me?</i>

1724
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:23,605
That's not what I said.

1725
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,506
It's just, like,
things have changed

1726
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:27,474
and we have evolved
past who we were--

1727
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:29,644
<i>You have evolved!</i>
<i>Sure! You've evolved!</i>

1728
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:32,112
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You have a fucking boyfriend.</i>

1729
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:33,781
<i>You have a fucking nice life!</i>

1730
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:36,618
I don't have a boyfriend.
I've never even met this dude.

1731
01:08:36,718 --> 01:08:39,854
I want to hang
out with him once, Sara.

1732
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:45,593
<i>Wha-- I-- I don't--</i>

1733
01:08:48,395 --> 01:08:50,263
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>Like, okay, fine.</i>

1734
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:52,466
<i>I'm a fucking stunted</i>
<i>or whatever. And I'm like--</i>

1735
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:56,403
<i>Whatever.</i>
<i>But I didn't think that--</i>

1736
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:58,106
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>that us being friends</i>

1737
01:08:58,205 --> 01:09:00,307
<i>was just</i>
<i>you being fucking bummed</i>

1738
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:02,242
<i>that I want to hang out</i>
<i>and talk all the time.</i>

1739
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:03,477
<i>I thought it was, like--</i>

1740
01:09:03,578 --> 01:09:05,013
That's literally
not what I said.

1741
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:07,749
Sara, I have not been
out of the house in months.

1742
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:09,449
I've not been out
of the house in months.

1743
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:11,451
All I want to do
is go on one date.

1744
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:13,253
One date, where
we're six feet apart.

1745
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:14,889
And we can't even see
each other's faces,

1746
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:16,390
'cause we're wearing masks.

1747
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,992
And I really don't think
that I'm asking that much.

1748
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:19,459
And the fact
that you're harping on this

1749
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,696
is, like, so indicative
of how you've been

1750
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:24,231
for our whole friendship,
do you realize that?

1751
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,901
Like, I feel like I can't
have anything without you.

1752
01:09:33,273 --> 01:09:34,676
<i>So...</i>

1753
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:41,049
<i>What the fuck</i>
<i>am I supposed to do?</i>

1754
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,751
I think you're
supposed to get over the fact

1755
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,787
that I'm gonna go
hang out with a person once.

1756
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:47,487
I'll wash my hands
when I come home. Okay?

1757
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:49,657
Like, I'll take my
clothes off at the door.

1758
01:09:49,757 --> 01:09:52,392
I'll-- Whatever you need me
to do, I'm doing this.

1759
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:54,696
I'm sorry. I'm doing it.
Like...

1760
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:57,699
<i>You're being such a fucking</i>
<i>bitch. Like, this is crazy.</i>

1761
01:09:57,799 --> 01:09:59,567
<i>You're just gonna do</i>
<i>something?</i>

1762
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,569
I guess it kind of fucking
takes one to know one, right?

1763
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:04,271
We have so much
in common, right?

1764
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,573
We spend all
this time together.

1765
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:07,175
I guess we're
both bitches, right?

1766
01:10:07,274 --> 01:10:08,810
[door buzzes]

1767
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:11,378
That's-- I ordered
a pizza and it's here--

1768
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:12,980
<i>I was so excited</i>
<i>to come back--</i>

1769
01:10:13,081 --> 01:10:15,282
I ordered a pizza and it's
here. I have to go get it.

1770
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:16,851
I'm sorry.
I will talk to you later.

1771
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:18,953
<i>No! You can't fucking go.</i>
<i>This is crazy--</i>

1772
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,188
[line dropping]

1773
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:21,756
[door buzzing]

1774
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:33,901
-[Naomi] Hey!
-[Reed] I brought the pizza.

1775
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:37,370
[Naomi] Oh, wow. I almost
didn't believe you, but here--

1776
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:39,372
-Cool if I come in?
-[Naomi] Whoa, um, come on in!

1777
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:40,775
[Reed] Cool, yeah. Okay, cool.

1778
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,643
Uh... Okay, I'll get this.

1779
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:45,813
-[Naomi] Oh, it's the top lock.
-[Reed] Yeah.

1780
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:47,715
[Naomi] Oh, um, the--
Sorry, second to top lock.

1781
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:49,717
-[Reed] Okay. Yeah, okay.
-I-- Yeah.

1782
01:10:50,184 --> 01:10:52,319
They really should be universal
at this point. You know, like--

1783
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:54,287
-[Reed] There's-- I'll-- Yeah.
-a-- like a shower.

1784
01:10:54,387 --> 01:10:55,823
-[Reed chuckles]
-[Naomi] Anyway, uh...

1785
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,059
-[both laugh]
-[Reed] This is crazy, right?

1786
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,460
[Naomi] Yeah, I can't believe--
I can't believe. This is-- Wow.

1787
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:02,563
Um, do you want
a glass of wine?

1788
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:04,464
[Reed]
Yes. That would be cool.

1789
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,000
[Naomi] All right, all right.
Um, I'll grab some glasses.

1790
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,535
Do you want
meet me at the couch?

1791
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:10,138
[Reed] Yeah, sure.
Uh, cool. Whoa, this is nice.

1792
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:11,471
[Naomi]
Oh, thank you.

1793
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:13,306
I actually, uh, built
the place myself.

1794
01:11:13,406 --> 01:11:15,375
-This is very good pizza.
-Yeah, I'm like, not--

1795
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:18,679
Honestly, there was a lot
of ricott-- and I'm a fan.

1796
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,648
And I was like, "Ooh,
is this gonna be too much?

1797
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:22,517
Am I gonna be overwhelmed?"
I'm feeling great.

1798
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:24,185
So, you're happy with
the amount of ricott--

1799
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:25,418
I'm really, really...

1800
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,921
Are we dropping the A?
Ricott?

1801
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:28,455
-Ricott.
-[rolls R] Ricott!

1802
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:29,957
-[laughs]
-[rolls R] Ricott!

1803
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:31,324
I knew it. You're Italian.

1804
01:11:31,424 --> 01:11:32,894
Uh, yup. Naples.

1805
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:34,695
[laughs]

1806
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:36,664
Should we, like, do something?

1807
01:11:37,732 --> 01:11:39,399
Sure. You got
a board game or something?

1808
01:11:40,701 --> 01:11:42,402
Do I have
a board game or something?

1809
01:11:42,502 --> 01:11:43,838
Did I ask something strange?

1810
01:11:43,938 --> 01:11:45,573
No, no, no. I-- I just
thought this was a date,

1811
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:47,175
not a playdate, but, um...

1812
01:11:47,275 --> 01:11:48,276
I have cards.
You wanna play some cards?

1813
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,677
We can play Go Fish.

1814
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:51,546
-[chuckles]
-[Reed laughs sarcastically]

1815
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:53,413
-No, for real--
-Now, what does Joker mean?

1816
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:55,082
Joker. Ah, they're actually
not supposed to be in there,

1817
01:11:55,183 --> 01:11:57,384
but I guess it means, like,
you can just put it down

1818
01:11:57,484 --> 01:11:59,253
and then put whatever
you want on top of it. Right?

1819
01:11:59,352 --> 01:12:01,255
Cool, uh, this and
then this, and then spit.

1820
01:12:01,354 --> 01:12:03,057
-You're such a fucker.
-Okay.

1821
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:04,759
-Eight. Nine, nine--
-Oh!

1822
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:06,027
[laughs]

1823
01:12:06,127 --> 01:12:08,129
What the freakin'--

1824
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:10,363
I actually did warn you
that I was good at this game.

1825
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,066
It sucked.
It sucked what you just did.

1826
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,400
It sucks what I just did.

1827
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,635
But also,
you suck at the game of Spit,

1828
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,369
so I don't know
what to tell you.

1829
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:17,605
-That's fair. That's fair.
-You wanna play again?

1830
01:12:17,705 --> 01:12:19,140
-Let's do it.
-[both chuckle]

1831
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,808
I'll tell you what.
I have a game.

1832
01:12:20,908 --> 01:12:22,743
You are absolutely
going to love it.

1833
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:25,412
-I am 100% in. I can't wait.
-You don't care what it is?

1834
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:27,081
I'm just gonna
tell you what it is--

1835
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,549
Tell me what-- I mean,
it's a game.

1836
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:30,251
It's a movie game and
now we're about to do it.

1837
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:31,953
It is the
Leonard Maltin Movie Game.

1838
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,855
Woo-hoo!

1839
01:12:33,955 --> 01:12:35,990
Yeah, I'm really--
Hold on. I'm really excited.

1840
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:38,125
[Reed laughing]

1841
01:12:38,226 --> 01:12:40,728
I'm going to say
a year from a movie,

1842
01:12:40,828 --> 01:12:42,429
-so I'll just pick a year.
-Okay.

1843
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,031
I'll give
you a clue for that movie.

1844
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:45,266
-Mm-hmm.
-And then I'm gonna

1845
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:46,901
read the cast from bottom up.

1846
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:49,469
And in that process,
as soon as you know the movie,

1847
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,005
just scream the name out.

1848
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:54,242
-The year is the year 2000.
-Ah, excellent year.

1849
01:12:54,342 --> 01:12:55,610
-Turn of the millennium.
-Mm-hmm.

1850
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,511
-Pre-911. Yeah.
-Y2K.

1851
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,248
I knew that you were gonna--

1852
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:01,816
I just knew
that you were gonna be

1853
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,718
the one out of us two to bring
up 9/11 on a first date.

1854
01:13:03,818 --> 01:13:05,286
-Why is that? Huh?
-You just seem--

1855
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:06,721
Huh, I wonder why that is. Huh.

1856
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:08,556
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1857
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:10,858
I wonder why <i>he</i> would
be the one to bring that up.

1858
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:13,895
-[laughter]
-Okay. Okay.

1859
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:17,464
First of all, I was leaning
Latino. See, my thing is,

1860
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:19,466
I bring up the Atlantic
slave trade on a first date.

1861
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:21,068
-Sure.
-And my friends are always,

1862
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,402
like, "Why do you do that?"

1863
01:13:22,502 --> 01:13:23,838
And I'm like,
"Because it applies."

1864
01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:25,339
-I think you do have it.
-No, I definitely do.

1865
01:13:25,438 --> 01:13:26,574
-I think you do have it.
-I definitely do.

1866
01:13:26,674 --> 01:13:30,278
Um, is it
the film <i>Heavyweights?</i>

1867
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:31,579
Should we move to London?

1868
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,413
-Let me think.
-Is this too sudden?

1869
01:13:33,514 --> 01:13:35,883
No, actually,
I think it's perfect timing.

1870
01:13:35,983 --> 01:13:37,450
-Yeah.
-But I've always felt like

1871
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:39,220
more of a Newcastle guy.

1872
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,888
What's--

1873
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:42,990
Uh, ah... Oh, my God.

1874
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,226
My cousin, Sadie, would
fucking kill me right now.

1875
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:46,994
[both laughing]

1876
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:49,330
I also-- You know what I love
about, uh, British television

1877
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:51,431
is that you don't
have to be super hot.

1878
01:13:51,532 --> 01:13:53,367
You just have
to be a good actor.

1879
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:55,202
-What's this guy's name?
-That's Jeremy.

1880
01:13:55,303 --> 01:13:56,804
-Okay.
-And that's Super Hans.

1881
01:13:56,904 --> 01:13:59,941
He's tied Super Hans
to a bed because Super Hans

1882
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,776
is trying to kick
the drugs that he's on.

1883
01:14:01,876 --> 01:14:03,377
-Mm-hmm.
-I'll make you watch this

1884
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:04,879
for the rest of the night.

1885
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:06,314
We won't do anything else.
Don't frickin' tempt me.

1886
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:08,015
Sure. Sure, sure.

1887
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:09,817
We'll watch <i>Peep Show</i> for
the rest of the night. Cool.

1888
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:10,985
[Naomi laughs]

1889
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:14,454
So, I'm staying for
the rest of the night?

1890
01:14:15,323 --> 01:14:16,557
I mean, you're already here.

1891
01:14:17,024 --> 01:14:20,661
I can't send a poor
drunk man spilling wine

1892
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,530
all over himself
out into the night.

1893
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,365
-[Naomi laughs]
-I gesture when I speak.

1894
01:14:24,464 --> 01:14:27,335
Okay, that's because you're--

1895
01:14:27,435 --> 01:14:28,769
A fun guy.

1896
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:30,104
Cheers.

1897
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:32,006
[both laughing]

1898
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,945
-Should we make out?
-Yep.

1899
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:40,181
[both laugh]

1900
01:14:41,082 --> 01:14:42,383
Your hair is so soft.

1901
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,618
Thank you. I've been
practicing to get it softer.

1902
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,554
You've been practicing
to get your hair softer?

1903
01:14:46,654 --> 01:14:48,322
Yeah. Yeah. For in case
this instance happens--

1904
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:49,924
I need you-- I need you to stop
talking.

1905
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:51,726
You didn't even
call my hair soft.

1906
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:53,694
-I haven't touched it yet.
-Okay, we're good.

1907
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:55,029
I don't want
to be inappropriate.

1908
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:56,630
There's one thing
I know is you don't touch

1909
01:14:56,731 --> 01:14:58,866
a Black woman's hair. [laughs]

1910
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,067
I'm out of here.

1911
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:02,737
[both laughing loudly]

1912
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:09,910
[horn honks]

1913
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:14,482
Is it morning already?

1914
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:16,817
[Reed] Yeah.
The sun's blasting.

1915
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,129
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

1916
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:32,666
Um, I feel like I should
eat so that I'm not hungover.

1917
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:34,201
-Mm-hmm.
-Are you hungry?

1918
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:35,703
I could eat.

1919
01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:38,507
What could I make-- Oh.

1920
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:40,141
Um...

1921
01:15:40,908 --> 01:15:46,414
Have you ever had
pizza reheated in a cast iron?

1922
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:47,915
I can't say I have, no.

1923
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,750
I'm about to blow your mind.
Watch this.

1924
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:51,986
[Reed] That shit's
gonna be fucked up.

1925
01:15:55,322 --> 01:15:56,557
Wait. Actually.

1926
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:57,625
I have to do
something really quick.

1927
01:15:57,725 --> 01:15:59,293
I'll be right, right back.

1928
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:07,635
[beep]

1929
01:16:08,636 --> 01:16:12,440
<i>Okay, so this</i>
<i>is quarantine day 85.</i>

1930
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:14,141
<i>I have to be really</i>
<i>quiet because Reed</i>

1931
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:15,810
<i>is, like, right there.</i>

1932
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:18,379
<i>Ah!</i>

1933
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,916
<i>We did that. And it was fine.</i>

1934
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:26,353
<i>Like, it was perfectly fine.</i>
<i>And he's really sweet.</i>

1935
01:16:26,454 --> 01:16:29,990
<i>And is it a little bit</i>
<i>fucked up that I had somebody</i>

1936
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:32,493
<i>who doesn't live here over,</i>
<i>during a pandemic?</i>

1937
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:35,463
<i>Sure. But, like,</i>
<i>he's really smart.</i>

1938
01:16:35,564 --> 01:16:39,600
<i>And I feel like he's, like,</i>
<i>respectful, and I trust him.</i>

1939
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,369
<i>And I know that I do,</i>
<i>because we have had</i>

1940
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:44,605
<i>to take all this time to,</i>
<i>like, get to know each other</i>

1941
01:16:44,705 --> 01:16:45,906
<i>when we literally</i>
<i>couldn't hang out in person.</i>

1942
01:16:46,006 --> 01:16:47,641
<i>And I feel like normally,</i>

1943
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,276
<i>it's like, you go</i>
<i>from meeting on Tinder</i>

1944
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:50,911
<i>to, like, fucking</i>
<i>and never hearing from them</i>

1945
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:53,747
<i>again in two and a half days?</i>

1946
01:16:53,848 --> 01:16:55,950
<i>And we've had,</i>
<i>like, almost four months.</i>

1947
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,885
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I guess-- I just trust him.</i>

1948
01:16:57,985 --> 01:16:59,887
<i>And I don't think</i>
<i>that he would put either of us</i>

1949
01:16:59,987 --> 01:17:02,022
<i>at risk to get this disease.</i>

1950
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,926
<i>You know, I've trusted dudes</i>
<i>before with mixed results.</i>

1951
01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:08,729
<i>But I feel good</i>
<i>about this one.</i> [laughs]

1952
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:11,866
<i>Yeah, I don't know.</i>
<i>He's so kind.</i>

1953
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:14,101
<i>And, like, his hair</i>
<i>is even softer in person,</i>

1954
01:17:14,201 --> 01:17:15,669
<i>if you can believe.</i>

1955
01:17:15,769 --> 01:17:18,038
<i>And I'm definitely</i>
<i>going to get a UTI.</i>

1956
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:20,774
<i>Like, for sure.</i>
<i>I know my body.</i>

1957
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,344
<i>I-- I should have peed.</i>

1958
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:26,981
<i>Do you have to pee</i>
<i>after you get fingered?</i>

1959
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:29,984
<i>They don't really</i>
<i>teach that in health class.</i>

1960
01:17:30,084 --> 01:17:31,919
<i>Do people still say,</i>
<i>"getting fingered"?</i>

1961
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,156
<i>Maybe I'm out of touch.</i>

1962
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:41,596
<i>Anyway. Part of me, like,</i>
<i>half-expected this dramatic,</i>

1963
01:17:41,695 --> 01:17:43,565
<i>sexy night</i>
<i>with, like, my concubine</i>

1964
01:17:43,664 --> 01:17:46,834
<i>forbidden to me</i>
<i>by my evil stepmother.</i>

1965
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:53,174
<i>Probably a little</i>
<i>strange that my brain</i>

1966
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:56,844
<i>immediately assigned Sara</i>
<i>as my evil stepmother, right?</i>

1967
01:17:56,944 --> 01:17:59,079
<i>Definitely some Freudian</i>
<i>shit there I gotta work out</i>

1968
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,248
<i>but I don't have</i>
<i>time to unpack right now.</i>

1969
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:05,352
<i>Speaking of, I...</i>

1970
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:07,488
<i>hadn't really</i>
<i>thought about Sara at all.</i>

1971
01:18:07,589 --> 01:18:09,456
<i>Like, until this</i>
<i>moment since our--</i>

1972
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:13,227
<i>Not argu-- Was it an argument?</i>

1973
01:18:15,597 --> 01:18:17,998
<i>I don't know. I don't</i>
<i>feel really good about it.</i>

1974
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,969
<i>And like, did</i>
<i>I lie directly to her face</i>

1975
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:27,374
<i>saying that Reed</i>
<i>wasn't going to be here? Sure.</i>

1976
01:18:27,474 --> 01:18:29,944
<i>But, like, it was last minute.</i>
<i>Like, I wasn't expecting it.</i>

1977
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:31,680
<i>And I certainly wasn't</i>
<i>expecting that fight</i>

1978
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:33,480
<i>last night. And...</i>

1979
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:37,751
<i>She's never gonna</i>
<i>find out, right? Like...</i>

1980
01:18:39,053 --> 01:18:40,221
[sighs]

1981
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,190
<i>No. I'm glad</i>
<i>it's out in the open.</i>

1982
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:45,226
<i>I'm glad we're saying</i>
<i>something about it because--</i>

1983
01:18:45,326 --> 01:18:47,394
<i>I'm actually-- You know what?</i>
<i>I'm proud of myself,</i>

1984
01:18:47,494 --> 01:18:48,796
<i>because I stood up for myself.</i>

1985
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,197
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>normally when we get</i>

1986
01:18:50,297 --> 01:18:51,799
<i>into these</i>
<i>conversations, I like,</i>

1987
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:53,200
<i>bring something</i>
<i>that's hard for her</i>

1988
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,401
<i>to understand</i>
<i>about herself up.</i>

1989
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:56,403
<i>And I'm met with like--</i>

1990
01:18:56,503 --> 01:18:59,574
<i>she brushes it off or she gets</i>
<i>really defensive</i>

1991
01:18:59,674 --> 01:19:01,108
<i>and starts crying.</i>

1992
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,844
<i>And it-- I turn out</i>
<i>apologizing somehow.</i>

1993
01:19:03,944 --> 01:19:05,980
<i>And I'm sick of that,</i>
<i>like, this is something</i>

1994
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,682
<i>that has</i>
<i>happened more than once.</i>

1995
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:09,283
<i>And it's not just</i>
<i>about the pandemic.</i>

1996
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:11,151
<i>It's, like, about</i>
<i>our friendship, obviously.</i>

1997
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:13,153
<i>And like, one time</i>
<i>I made a bunch of baked ziti,</i>

1998
01:19:13,254 --> 01:19:15,322
<i>and I slaved over that baked</i>
<i>ziti. And it was delicious.</i>

1999
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:16,957
<i>And the next day</i>
<i>there was a whole pan</i>

2000
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:18,593
<i>of leftovers in the fridge.</i>

2001
01:19:18,693 --> 01:19:20,160
<i>And I got back</i>
<i>from work and she'd,</i>

2002
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:21,596
<i>like, eaten most of it,</i>
<i>and she said she thought</i>

2003
01:19:21,696 --> 01:19:23,097
<i>it was because I was leaving</i>

2004
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,832
<i>town that weekend,</i>
<i>but this was a Thursday,</i>

2005
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,333
<i>so why would</i>
<i>I leave town on a Thursday?</i>

2006
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:27,835
<i>Like, I was leaving</i>
<i>town that weekend,</i>

2007
01:19:27,935 --> 01:19:29,103
<i>but I would leave Friday.</i>

2008
01:19:29,203 --> 01:19:30,672
<i>And it turned into, like,</i>

2009
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:33,040
<i>her crying and me saying sorry</i>

2010
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,842
<i>for her eating my baked ziti?</i>

2011
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,910
<i>That ricotta was expensive.</i>

2012
01:19:38,747 --> 01:19:40,114
[sighs]

2013
01:19:42,883 --> 01:19:45,986
<i>I did call</i>
<i>her a bitch to her face.</i>

2014
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:48,188
<i>Not that I have any problem</i>
<i>with the word "bitch".</i>

2015
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:50,291
<i>Like, we're taking it back.</i>
<i>That's ours.</i>

2016
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:53,193
<i>And she called</i>
<i>me a bitch, too.</i>

2017
01:19:55,829 --> 01:19:57,398
-[sighs]
<i>-I don't know.</i>

2018
01:19:57,498 --> 01:20:02,036
<i>I just feel like we need</i>
<i>to, like, talk about things.</i>

2019
01:20:02,136 --> 01:20:04,004
<i>Maybe we should go</i>
<i>to, like, couples counseling.</i>

2020
01:20:04,104 --> 01:20:07,374
<i>No, that's weird.</i>
<i>Why would I say that?</i>

2021
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,810
<i>Like, we don't need</i>
<i>to go to couples counseling.</i>

2022
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,713
<i>We're not a fucking couple.</i>
<i>We're just--</i>

2023
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:13,213
<i>She's my friend. And--</i>

2024
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:15,849
<i>Maybe she's not</i>
<i>even my friend.</i>

2025
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,152
<i>Like, maybe</i>
<i>that's what this is.</i>

2026
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:20,087
<i>Maybe we've just</i>
<i>outgrown each other.</i>

2027
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:24,793
<i>And I have 10K</i>
<i>in the bank for the first time</i>

2028
01:20:24,892 --> 01:20:27,027
<i>ever in my whole life.</i>

2029
01:20:27,127 --> 01:20:29,263
<i>I can move out.</i>
<i>I could go on my own.</i>

2030
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:30,898
<i>I could find</i>
<i>an apartment in Brooklyn</i>

2031
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:32,433
<i>for 10K for at</i>
<i>least a couple of months</i>

2032
01:20:32,534 --> 01:20:34,168
<i>until I, inevitably,</i>
<i>have to go back home</i>

2033
01:20:34,268 --> 01:20:35,869
<i>and live with my</i>
<i>parents because the pandemic</i>

2034
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:37,304

<i>Why am I even-- What am</i>
<i>I spiraling about right now?</i>

01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:44,512
