1
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,100
"Howl" for Carl Solomon.

2
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:30,471
<i>I saw the best minds</i>
<i>of my generation</i>

3
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,741
<i>destroyed by madness,</i>

4
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,745
<i>starving hysterical naked,</i>

5
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:40,346
<i>dragging themselves through</i>
<i>the negro streets at dawn</i>

6
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:42,618
<i>looking for an angry fix,</i>

7
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,761
<i>angel headed hipsters burning</i>

8
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:49,127
<i>for the ancient heavenly</i>
<i>connection to the starry dynamo</i>

9
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,166
<i>in the machinery of night,</i>

10
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:53,901
<i>who poverty and tatters and</i>

11
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:55,903
<i>hollow eyed and high</i>

12
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,773
<i>sat up smoking in the supernatural</i>
<i>darkness of cold water flats</i>

13
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:05,109
<i>floating across the tops</i>
<i>of cities contemplating jazz!</i>

14
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,397
Sometimes I feel in command
when I'm writing.

15
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:15,369
When I'm in the heat
of some truthful tears, yes.

16
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,504
Other times...
most of the time, not.

17
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,244
You know, just diddling around...

18
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,946
woodcarving, you know,
finding a pretty shape,

19
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,716
like most of my poetry.

20
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:32,788
There's only been a few times
when I've reached a state of...

21
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,989
complete control...

22
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:38,098
Probably a piece of "Howl,"
and...

23
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:40,897
one or two moments
in other poems.

24
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:48,941
The beginning
of the fear for me was

25
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:54,049
what would my father think
of something that I would write.

26
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,815
At the time, writing "Howl,"

27
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,477
I assumed when writing it that

28
00:04:58,622 --> 00:04:59,953
it was not something
that would be published,

29
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,079
because...

30
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:04,991
I wouldn't want my daddy
to see what was in there.

31
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:07,461
So, I assumed it wouldn't be
published, therefore, I could

32
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,065
write anything that I wanted to.

33
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,922
<i>I saw the best minds</i>
<i>of my generation</i>

34
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,958
<i>destroyed by madness,</i>

35
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:13,789
<i>starving hysterical naked,</i>

36
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,096
<i>draggling themselves through</i>
<i>the negro streets at dawn</i>

37
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:19,668
<i>looking for an angry fix,</i>

38
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:24,601
<i>angel headed hipsters</i>

39
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:27,438
<i>burning for the</i>
<i>ancient heavenly connection</i>

40
00:06:27,578 --> 00:06:30,672
<i>to the starry dynamo</i>
<i>in the machinery of night,</i>

41
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,983
<i>who poverty and tatters</i>

42
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,054
<i>and hollow eyed and high</i>

43
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:40,622
<i>sat up smoking</i>
<i>in the supernatural darkness</i>

44
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,749
<i>of cold water flats</i>

45
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:47,227
<i>floating across the tops of</i>
<i>cities, contemplating jazz,</i>

46
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:52,291
<i>who passed through universities</i>
<i>with radiant cool eyes</i>

47
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:54,199
<i>hallucinating Arkansas and</i>

48
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:58,104
<i>Blake-light tragedy</i>
<i>among the scholars of war,</i>

49
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:02,072
<i>who were expelled</i>
<i>from the academies for crazy</i>

50
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:06,148
<i>& publishing obscene odes</i>
<i>on the windows of the skull,</i>

51
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,813
<i>who cowered in</i>
<i>unshaven rooms in underwear,</i>

52
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,080
<i>burning their money</i>
<i>in wastebaskets</i>

53
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,248
<i>and listening to the Terror</i>
<i>through the wall,</i>

54
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:18,184
<i>who got busted</i>
<i>in their pubic beards</i>

55
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:22,321
<i>returning through Laredo with a
<i>belt of marijuana for New York,</i>

56
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,458
<i>who ate fire</i>
<i>in paint hotels or drank</i>

57
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:28,264
<i>turpentine in Paradise Alley,</i>

58
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:29,702
<i>death</i>

59
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,970
<i>or purgatoried their torsos</i>
<i>night after night with dreams,</i>

60
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:36,909
<i>with drugs,</i>
<i>with waking nightmares,</i>

61
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:41,643
<i>alcohol and cock</i>
<i>and endless balls,</i>

62
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:53,125
What I wanted to read into
the record, Your Honor, is

63
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:56,494
not very much,
but it is pertinent to our case.

64
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,727
Why aren't you at the trial?

65
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,100
'Cause...

66
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:04,707
the trial's not about me.

67
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,406
As much as I have to thank them

68
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:10,536
completely for my fame...

69
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:13,047
it's the publisher,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti that was

70
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,947
busted for selling

71
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:18,054
obscene materials.

72
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:22,921
What I want to show is on
the first page inside of "Howl."

73
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,689
it says, "All these books
are published in Heaven."

74
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:28,056
And...

75
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:31,095
I don't quite understand that,
but anyway,

76
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:32,429
let the record show, Your Honor,

77
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:35,367
it's published by
the City Lights Pocketbook Shop.

78
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,635
Mr. Ferlinghetti could go
to jail if convicted?

79
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:41,209
I hope not.
That would be terrible.

80
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:05,565
May I have your name, please?

81
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:07,029
Gail Potter.

82
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,638
And have you done
any writing yourself?

83
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:11,434
Yes, I have done considerable.

84
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:15,671
I was on an NBC station for
10 years while I was teaching.

85
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,708
I was
community service director,

86
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,577
educational coordinator...

87
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,778
I have rewritten "Faust."

88
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,353
it took me three years
to do that, but I did it.

89
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:26,046
I rewrote "Everyman."

90
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:30,192
That isn't as funny
as you might think.

91
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,157
Pardon me, madam.

92
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:32,353
Ladies and gentlemen,

93
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:34,555
this is a trial
that involves serious issues.

94
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:36,256
Now kindly accord the witness

95
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,958
the courtesy you would want
to be accorded.

96
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:38,692
Alright.

97
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:41,963
And did you form an opinion as
to whether or not the book called

98
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:46,007
"Howl and Other Poems"
has any literary merit?

99
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,610
I think it has
no literary merit.

100
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:53,741
Go ahead.

101
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,079
in order to have literary style,
you must have

102
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:59,416
form, diction,
fluidity, clarity.

103
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:01,888
Now, I am speaking
only of style.

104
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,357
And in content,
every great piece of literature,

105
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:08,260
anything that can really be
classified as literature, is...

106
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,490
of some moral greatness,

107
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,828
and I think this fails
to the nth degree.

108
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:13,325
I see.

109
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,370
Can you think of
any other reasons?

110
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:16,335
Yes...

111
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:17,633
Use of language.

112
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,436
in regards to the figures
of speech he uses,

113
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:21,601
he fails in rhetoric,
of course,

114
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:24,009
for one thing, because
his figures of speech are

115
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,775
crude, and you feel like
you are going through the gutter

116
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,714
when you read that stuff.

117
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,816
I didn't linger on it long,
I assure you.

118
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,184
You may cross examine.

119
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,391
Step down.

120
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:42,231
There's something more you want?

121
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,930
Step down.

122
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,060
Mr. Ehrlich doesn't want
to cross examine.

123
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,104
You're through with me?

124
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,406
Step down.

125
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:54,642
What is "The Beat Generation"?

126
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,275
There is no Beat Generation.

127
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:03,343
it's just a bunch of guys,
trying to get published.

128
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:09,451
Why don't you tell me
how you started writing poetry?

129
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:14,955
I started writing poetry
because I was a dope,

130
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,629
and my father wrote poetry.

131
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:21,701
So I began writing
rhymes like him.

132
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,906
And then I went to Columbia
University and I fell in love

133
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,006
with Jack Kerouac.

134
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:43,559
Until I was 18, I was a virgin.

135
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:47,421
I was unable to reach out
to anybody's body.

136
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,726
To reach out to desire.

137
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,163
I just felt...

138
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,268
Chained.

139
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,943
Jack gave me permission
to open up.

140
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,273
He's a romantic poet.

141
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:07,609
And he taught me that
writing is personal,

142
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:11,152
that it comes from
the writer's own person.

143
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:12,112
His body,

144
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:14,055
his breathing rhythm,

145
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,482
his actual talk.

146
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:22,289
Eventually I developed a much
deeper sense of confession.

147
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:23,990
I needed to...

148
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:28,503
express my feelings to him,
but he didn't want to hear them.

149
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:31,698
So I had to find a new way
of expressing them...

150
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,104
a way that would entrance him.

151
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,680
This is good here.

152
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,977
"I was offered refreshments
which I accepted.

153
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:42,881
"I ate a sandwich of pure meat.

154
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,249
"Enormous sandwich of
human flesh, I noticed,

155
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:46,787
"while I was chewing on it.

156
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,050
"it also included
a dirty asshole!"

157
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,415
That's good!

158
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,988
That's good!
The meat and the asshole.

159
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:54,825
Allen, alright.

160
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:58,059
And then I realized
that if I actually

161
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:02,736
admitted and confessed
the secret tenderness

162
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:05,068
of my soul in my writing,

163
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,200
he would understand nakedly
who I was. And so...

164
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:11,405
that sincere talk
replaced the earlier

165
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:14,813
imitative rhyming
that I was doing for my father.

166
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,081
Jack was the first person
I really opened up to and said,

167
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,753
"I'm a homosexual."

168
00:13:26,363 --> 00:13:30,823
I very soon realized that nobody
was really shocked by anything.

169
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:33,996
Unless you're out
murdering people, you know,

170
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:38,965
People would never
really be shocked by

171
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,134
an expression of feeling.

172
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:47,808
Really I wrote "Howl" for Jack.

173
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,114
<i>Who chained themselves to</i>
<i>subways for the endless ride</i>

174
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:58,284
<i>from Battery to holy Bronx</i>
<i>on benzedrine</i>

175
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:02,191
<i>until the noise of wheels</i>
<i>and children brought them down</i>

176
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:05,859
<i>shuddering mouth wracked</i>
<i>and battered bleak of brain</i>

177

<i>all drained of brilliance</i>
<i>in the drear light of Zoo,</i>

178
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,037
<i>Who talked continuously 70 hours</i>

179
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,145
<i>from park to pad</i>
<i>to bar to Bellevue</i>

180
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,839
<i>to museum</i>
<i>to the Brooklyn Bridge,</i>

181
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:24,381
<i>A lost battalion of</i>
<i>platonic conversationalists</i>

182
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,045
<i>jumping down the stoops,</i>

183
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:29,352
<i>off fire escapes,</i>
<i>off windowsills,</i>

184
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,016
<i>off Empire State,</i>

185
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,890
<i>out of the moon,</i>

186
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:38,628
<i>yacketayakking</i>
<i>screaming vomiting</i>

187
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:42,295
<i>whispering facts and memories</i>
<i>and anecdotes and</i>

188
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:47,376
<i>eyeball kicks and shocks</i>
<i>of hospitals and jails and wars</i>

189
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:54,581
<i>who lit cigarettes</i>
<i>in boxcars boxcars boxcars</i>

190
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:59,553
<i>racketing through snow toward</i>
<i>lonesome farms in grand father night</i>

191
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,250
<i>who studied Plotinus</i>
<i>Poe St. John of the Cross,</i>

192
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,723
<i>telepathy and bop kabbalah</i>

193
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:10,458
<i>because the cosmos instinctively</i>
<i>vibrated at their feet in Kansas,</i>

194
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,492
<i>who loned it</i>
<i>through the streets of Idaho</i>

195
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:16,071
<i>seeking visionary Indian angels</i>

196
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,232
<i>who were</i>
<i>visionary Indian angels,</i>

197
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:23,006
<i>who jumped in limousines</i>
<i>with the Chinaman of Oklahoma</i>

198
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:27,742
<i>on the Impulse of winter midnight</i>
<i>streetlight small town ran,</i>

199
00:15:28,952 --> 00:15:31,045
<i>who reappeared on the West Coast</i>

200
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:34,850
<i>investigating the FBI</i>
<i>in beards and shorts</i>

201
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:37,221
<i>with big pacifist eyes</i>

202
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,294
<i>sexy in their dark skin</i>

203
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,887
<i>passing out</i>
<i>incomprehensible leaflets,</i>

204
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:46,762
<i>who burned cigarette holes</i>
<i>in their arms</i>

205
00:15:46,903 --> 00:15:50,737
<i>protesting the narcotic</i>
<i>tobacco haze of Capitalism,</i>

206
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:57,307
<i>who distributed Super Communist</i>
<i>pamphlets in Union Square</i>

207
00:15:57,447 --> 00:16:00,416
<i>weeping and undressing</i>
<i>while the sirens of Los Alamos</i>

208
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,348
<i>walled them down</i>
<i>and walled down Wall,</i>

209
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,546
<i>and the Staten Island Ferry</i>
<i>also walled,</i>

210
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:13,528
<i>who let themselves be fucked in</i>
<i>the ass by saintly motorcyclists</i>

211
00:16:13,663 --> 00:16:16,154
<i>and screamed with joy,</i>

212
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:24,601
<i>who blew and were blown by those</i>
<i>human seraphim, the sailors,</i>

213
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:28,609
<i>caresses of Atlantic</i>
<i>and Caribbean love.</i>

214
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:40,588
The problem, when it
comes to literature, is this:

215
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,554
There are many writers
who have preconceived ideas

216
00:16:44,694 --> 00:16:46,286
about what literature
is supposed to be,

217
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:50,490
but their ideas seem to preclude

218
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,999
everything that makes them
most interesting

219
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,127
in casual conversation.

220
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:56,470
Their faggishness,

221
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:58,105
their solitude,

222
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,299
their neuroses,

223
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,603
their goofiness,

224
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:02,973
their campiness,

225
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:06,776
or, even
their masculinity at times.

226
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,578
Because they think that
they're gonna write something

227
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,983
that sounds like something else
that they've read before,

228
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,350
instead of

229
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,616
sounds like them.

230
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:17,158
Or, comes from their own life.

231
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:19,419
We all talk amongst ourselves;

232
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,496
we have a common understanding,

233
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:25,260
we say anything we want to say.
We talk about our assholes,

234
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:26,767
we talk about our cocks,

235
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:29,701
we talk about
who we fucked last night,

236
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,932
or who we're gonna
fuck tomorrow,

237
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,805
or what kind of
love affair we're in, or

238
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:38,539
when we got drunk and had a broom
stick shoved up our ass in the

239
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,444
Hotel Ambassador in Prague...

240
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:45,350
I mean, everyone tells
one's friends about that! Right?

241
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,386
So...

242
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:50,450
the question is, what happens
when you make a distinction

243
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:53,653
between what you tell your friends
and what you tell your Muse?

244
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,694
The trick is to break down
that distinction,

245
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,199
to approach your Muse as

246
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:02,930
frankly as you would talk
to yourself or to your friends.

247
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:10,907
it's the ability
to commit to writing to write

248
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:12,974
the same way that

249
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:14,276
you are.

250
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:19,245
<i>Who balled in the morning</i>
<i>in the evenings</i>

251
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:24,588
<i>in rose gardens and the grass</i>
<i>of public parks and cemeteries</i>

252
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:29,926
<i>scattering their semen freely</i>
<i>to whomever come who may,</i>

253
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,498
<i>Who hiccupped endlessly</i>
<i>trying to giggle</i>

254
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:38,096
<i>but wound up with a sob behind</i>
<i>a partition in a Turkish bath</i>

255
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:43,144
<i>with a blonde and naked angel</i>
<i>came to pierce them with a sword,</i>

256
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,874
The act of writing becomes,
like, a meditation exercise.

257
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:52,621
If you walk down the street
in New York for a few blocks,

258
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:56,589
you'll get this
gargantuan feeling of buildings.

259
00:18:56,726 --> 00:19:00,992
And, if you walk all day,
you'll be on the verge of tears.

260
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,992
But, you have to walk all day
before you get that sensation.

261
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:09,828
What I mean is, if you write
all day, you'll get into it.

262
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:13,431
Into your body, into your feelings,
into your consciousness...

263
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:19,073
I don't write enough
in that way.

264
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:35,788
<i>Who lost their loveboys to</i>
<i>the three old shrews of fate</i>

265
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:40,126
<i>the one eyed shrew</i>
<i>of the heterosexual dollar</i>

266
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:43,497
<i>the one eyed shrew</i>
<i>that winks out of the womb</i>

267
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,167
<i>and the one eyed shrew that</i>
<i>does nothing but sit on her ass</i>

268
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,906
<i>and snip the Intellectual golden</i>
<i>threads of the craftsman's loom</i>

269
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,750
<i>who copulated ecstatic and</i>
<i>Insatiate with a bottle of beer,</i>

270
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:59,411
<i>a sweetheart,</i>
<i>a package of cigarettes,</i>

271
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,820
<i>a candle and fell off the bed</i>

272
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,052
<i>and continued along the floor</i>
<i>and down the hall</i>

273
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,322
<i>and ended fainting on the wall</i>

274
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,488
<i>with a vision of</i>
<i>ultimate cunt and come</i>

275
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,499
<i>eluding the last gyzym</i>
<i>of consclousness,</i>

276
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:20,801
<i>who faded out</i>
<i>in vast sordid movies,</i>

277
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,775
<i>were shifted in dreams,</i>

278
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:26,507
<i>woke on a sudden Manhattan,</i>
<i>and picked themselves up</i>

279
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:30,415
<i>out of basements</i>
<i>hungover with heartless Tokay</i>

280
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:33,681
<i>and horrors of</i>
<i>Third Avenue Iron dreams</i>

281
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,849
<i>and stumbled to</i>
<i>unemployment offices,</i>

282
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:43,461
<i>who created</i>
<i>great suicidal dramas</i>

283
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
<i>on the apartment cliff banks</i>
<i>of the Hudson</i>

284
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:49,593
<i>under the wartime blue</i>
<i>floodlight of the moon</i>

285
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:53,675
<i>and their heads shall be crowned</i>
<i>with laurel in oblivion,</i>

286
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,470
<i>who wept at the romance</i>
<i>of the streets</i>

287
00:20:56,613 --> 00:21:00,310
<i>with their pushcarts</i>
<i>full of onions and bad music,</i>

288
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,486
<i>who sat in boxes breathing</i>
<i>in the darkness under the bridge,</i>

289
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:08,917
<i>and rose up to build</i>
<i>harpsichords in their lofts,</i>

290
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:18,934
<i>who scribbled all night rocking</i>
<i>and rolling over lofty incantations</i>

291
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:22,765
<i>which in the yellow morning</i>
<i>were stanzas of gibberish,</i>

292
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,937
<i>who were burned alive</i>
<i>in their Innocent flannel suits</i>

293
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:28,168
<i>on Madison Avenue</i>

294
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:30,472
<i>amid blasts of leaden verse</i>

295
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:34,549
<i>and the tanked up clatter</i>
<i>of the Iron regiments of fashion</i>

296
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:39,445
<i>and the nitroglycerine shrieks</i>
<i>of the fairies of advertising</i>

297
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:43,184
<i>and the mustard gas</i>
<i>of sinister intelligent editors,</i>

298
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:48,229
<i>or were run down by the drunken</i>
<i>taxicabs of Absolute Reality.</i>

299
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,364
Would you say that
"Howl" has any literary merit?

300
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:57,632
Yes.

301
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,904
And I presume you understand
the whole thing, is that right?

302
00:22:02,145 --> 00:22:03,442
I hope so.

303
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:06,274
it's not always easy
to know that one

304
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,510
understands exactly what
a contemporary poet is saying,

305
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:10,880
but I think I do.

306
00:22:11,254 --> 00:22:14,223
Well, let's go
into some of this.

307
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,894
"With dreams, with drugs,
with waking nightmares,

308
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,329
"alcohol and cock
and endless balls."

309
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:27,699
What significance
does that have to you?

310
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:29,560
Well...

311
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,709
there are uprooted people
wandering around the United States,

312
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:36,002
dreaming,

313
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:37,975
drugged...

314
00:22:38,414 --> 00:22:39,972
That's clear isn't it?

315
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:42,710
Even their waking hours
like nightmares,

316
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:45,480
loaded with liquor and...

317
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:48,351
enjoying, I take it,

318
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:52,325
a variety of indiscriminate
sexual experience.

319
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,928
You understand what
"angelheaded hipsters

320
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:58,829
"burning for the ancient
heavenly connection

321
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:02,597
"to the starry dynamo in the
machinery of night" means?

322
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:07,504
Sir, you can't translate
poetry into prose.

323
00:23:07,944 --> 00:23:09,571
That's why it is poetry.

324
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:12,306
But what are
"angelheaded hipsters"?

325
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:32,559
I was working as a copyboy
at Associated Press,

326
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,899
and I was able to manage things.

327
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,030
Except that I was living in a
$13 a month, cold water apartment

328
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:41,700
filled with junkies and thieves.

329
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:46,509
So the place was being filled
with stolen silverware and

330
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:48,480
beautiful oaken furniture

331
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:51,485
taken from the lobbies
of apartment buildings.

332
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,586
At a certain point,

333
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,793
I figured that things were
getting too hot, and that...

334
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:00,896
I'd better get out of there.
You know, get out from under.

335
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,758
So...

336
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,492
I piled myself
and all my manuscripts

337
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:06,226
into the back of some guy's car

338
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,599
that turned out to be stolen.

339
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,463
You know, he had in the back,

340
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:13,769
all these stolen suits
and suitcases and silverware,

341
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,378
and he turned the wrong way
up a one way street,

342
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:18,878
at the end of which
there was a police car.

343
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:21,575
So he swerves his car
to take a side road out,

344
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:24,978
and skidded and smashed
and papers flying...

345
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:27,851
my eyeglasses lost,
all the clothes upside down.

346
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,725
I jumped out, looked around, and

347
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,328
went back in the car
to find my notebooks, but

348
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:36,864
I couldn't find my eyeglasses,
so I couldn't find my papers.

349
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,229
The crowd was gathering around.

350
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:40,630
Chaos.

351
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,101
Chaos.

352
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,635
The easiest way
to get out of the whole thing,

353
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,176
as it turns out, was

354
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:53,476
to just go to the Psychiatric
Institute on 168th Street.

355
00:24:57,086 --> 00:25:01,523
I was in the looney bin
for eight months.

356
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:04,683
I met Carl Solomon there.

357
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:08,596
He was thinking
about the void, also

358
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:10,198
and such problems, and...

359
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,401
We spent months sitting around
asking ourselves whether the

360
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,835
authority of the doctors

361
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,373
and their sense of reality
was right for us

362
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:22,706
or whether we were right,
or you know what was happening.

363
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,680
And Carl was having problems

364
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,751
because he was receiving
shock treatment.

365
00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:34,278
I didn't have any of that,
no medication, no shock.

366
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:40,726
'Cause I'd promised the doctor
that I would be heterosexual.

367
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,130
And that's how I got out.

368
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:49,003
Your mother was
institutionalized, wasn't she?

She died

403
00:27:45,855 --> 00:27:47,789
<i>I am not safe,</i>

404
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:54,185
<i>and now you're really in</i>
<i>the total animal soup of time...</i>

405
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,918
After I got out of
the mental hospital,

406
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:56,581
I had a period of fear where...

407
00:28:57,093 --> 00:28:59,027
I felt I had to
get out of New York.

408
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,624
I was questioning
my sense of reality versus the

409
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,497
social sense
that was being imposed on me.

410
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,237
it was a position that...

411
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:12,436
Many people in the hospital
came out with, you know,

412
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:14,702
a total self rejection,

413
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:17,944
a rejection of, you know,
their own universe.

414
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:21,146
Lip service, actually, to...

415
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:25,014
supposedly acceptable
social patterns.

416
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:28,389
But I was falling in love
over and over again,

417
00:29:28,524 --> 00:29:30,492
and I kept writing
my poetry about

418
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:32,321
the people
I was falling in love with.

419
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:33,792
All straight men.

420
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:37,695
And I hitch hiked cross country

421
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,597
from Denver
with my friend, Neal Cassady.

422
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,705
And Neal was very frenetic,

423
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,272
very charming,

424
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:47,875
and he had six thousand

425
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,138
girls across the continent
that were keeping him very busy.

426
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:56,547
Ok... um... no. Um...

427
00:29:57,753 --> 00:29:58,583
Kiss!

428
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:02,784
Wait, wait, you have something...

429
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,553
I'll get that.

430
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:06,191
Better?
Yeah.

431
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:15,763
Get it?
I got it.

432
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:23,172
One day, Neal and I were
thrown together in bed, at 4 am

433
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:24,540
By circumstance...

434
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,308
with no place else to go
and no place else to sleep.

435
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:31,078
And I remember
being a little scared,

436
00:30:31,687 --> 00:30:34,053
and not quite sure
what to do, so...

437
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:37,751
I sort of like turned over and

438
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:40,862
stiffened my body
and got on the edge of the bed.

439
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:44,032
And he saw that I was shy.

440
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,830
At the time I was still...

441
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:50,564
scared of feeling
with another person.

442
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:56,474
So he put his arm around me,

443
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:59,206
and pulled me, and

444
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:02,678
put my head on his breast, and

445
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:05,082
gave me love, actually.

446
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,111
And then one day,
I got a letter

447
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:42,156
saying, finally,

448
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,589
"We shouldn't consider
ourselves lovers...

449
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:47,093
"I'm distracted with the wife,

450
00:31:48,597 --> 00:31:50,224
"as much as I love you."

451
00:31:51,567 --> 00:31:54,434
So my heart was broken.

452
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:01,467
"Dear Allen,

453
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:04,612
"What you say is honestly
what I've been doing

454
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:07,272
"or striving for all my life.

455
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,247
"Therein lies our,

456
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,149
"or my confused sense
of closeness.

457
00:32:12,454 --> 00:32:16,322
"Also I fear therein lies our
strength of tie to each other.

458
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:17,550
"I say, 'I fear,'

459
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:21,390
"for I really don't know how much
I can be satisfied to love you.

460
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,656
"I mean 'bodily.'

461
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,256
"You know, I sometimes dislike
pricks and men and before you

462
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,701
"had consciously forced myself
to be homosexual.

463
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:32,402
"You meant so much to me.

464
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:35,975
"I now feel I was forcing
a desire for you bodily

465
00:32:36,111 --> 00:32:37,806
"as a compensation to you

466
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,775
"for all you were giving me.

467
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:41,776
"Allen, this is straight.

468
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:45,646
"What I truly want is to live
with you from September to June,

469
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:49,019
"have an apartment,
a girl, go to college,

470
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:50,819
"see all and do all,

471
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,327
"and become truly straight,
so please, Allen,

472
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:56,829
"give this
a good deal of thought."

473
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,303
<i>Who drove cross country 72 hours</i>

I think it's a howl of pain.

499
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,193
Figuratively speaking,
his toes have been stepped on.

500
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:43,361
He's poetically putting
his cry of pain and

501
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:45,132
protest into this book, "Howl."

502
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:48,471
And do you think this book
has definite literary value?

503
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:49,608
I do.

504
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:52,039
As a matter of fact,
I think in a way

505
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:55,207
he is employing
the jazz phraseology here

506
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,443
and, may I say, I...

507
00:34:57,586 --> 00:35:02,717
I think he's also employing
the words he heard

508
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:06,294
in his life on the road
and in his various experiences.

509
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,488
Thank you.

510
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:12,225
Now, do you understand
most of the words in this book?

511
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:14,662
I think
I understand their significance

512
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,668
and the general context of it.

513
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,063
I see.

514
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,875

00:35:24,012 --> 00:35:25,070
the 14th line:

516
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,050
"Who howled on their knees
in the subway

517
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:34,212
"and were dragged off the roof
waving genitals and manuscripts."

518
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:37,684
Now, do you understand what
that paragraph is trying to say,

519
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:40,386
as a part of the "Howl"?

520
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:42,095
Not explicitly.

521
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:46,263
I would say
he was attempting to show the...

522
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:49,632
lack of inhibition
in the persons he's talking of,

523
00:35:50,706 --> 00:35:53,197
post World War II generation...

524
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,171
those who returned,

525
00:35:56,311 --> 00:36:00,213
went into college or went into
work immediately after WW II

526
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:05,513
perhaps were somewhat displaced
by the chaos of the war and

527
00:36:05,654 --> 00:36:07,849
didn't immediately settle down.

528
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,518
Now, the next paragraph:

529
00:36:16,064 --> 00:36:19,261
"Who blew and were blown

530
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:23,269
"by those human seraphim,
the sailors,

531
00:36:23,405 --> 00:36:27,136
"caresses of Atlantic
and Caribbean love."

532
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:31,178
Now, you understand what
"blew" and "blown" mean?

533
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:34,079
Well, I think they are words
that have several meanings.

534
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,881
What meanings do you attribute
to the words in this paragraph?

535
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,285
it can at one level mean...
that they were vagabonds,

536
00:36:41,423 --> 00:36:45,826
that they were being blown about
by natural, literal winds.

537
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:49,089
On the other hand, perhaps it
does have a sexual connotation.

538
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:52,928
in reference
to oral copulation, right?

539
00:36:53,235 --> 00:36:54,497
Yes, possibly.

540
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:56,531
Now then, do you find
that those words

541
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,435
are necessary to the context

542
00:36:58,574 --> 00:37:00,303
to make it a work
of literary value?

543
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,137
I thought we had settled this,
Your Honor.

544
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:04,802
Yes, Mr. McIntosh,
if you will recall,

545
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:08,110
I said that I would not allow
the use of the word "necessary."

546
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,950
But you may ask the question,
"Are they relevant?"

547
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:15,182
Are they relevant to make
this a work of literary value?

548
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:16,848
Yes, I would say so.

549
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:19,654
Now then if you took
those words out of there,

550
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,825
Would that spoil the portrayal?

551
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:24,933
That's doing indirectly what Your Honor
won't permit him to do directly.

552
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:27,126
This man is an expert.

553
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:28,869
He has to speculate.

554
00:37:29,004 --> 00:37:33,373
No, Mr. McIntosh, I'm afraid
I can't go along with you on that.

555
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:37,239
Whether the author might
have used other or different words,

556
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:40,007
you're getting into
the realm of speculation there.

557
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:41,638
Objection sustained.

558
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,511
Going down a little further...

559
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:51,318
"who sweetened the snatches
of a million girls

560
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,419
"trembling in the sunset,
and were red eyed in the morning

561
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:59,523
"but prepared to sweeten
the snatch of the sunrise,

562
00:37:59,668 --> 00:38:04,401
"flashing buttocks under barns
and naked in the lake."

563
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,171
What's your question?

564
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:13,207
is that word "snatches"
in there...

565
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:14,747
is that...

566
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:18,148
relevant to Mr. Ginsberg's
literary endeavor?

567
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:22,690
Yes. I think to use euphemisms
in describing this would...

568
00:38:23,892 --> 00:38:26,360
seem dishonest to Mr. Ginsberg.

569
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:30,589
You also said, I believe,
literary value sometimes

570
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:34,395
is a book which will survive
any test of time.

571
00:38:34,536 --> 00:38:37,300
Do you think Mr. Ginsberg's work
will survive the test of time?

572
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,430
He has no way of knowing,

573
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:42,441
no more than some people thought
"Leaves of Grass" would survive.

574
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:45,410
I'm asking him for his opinion,
to give us an opinion on that book.

575
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:47,481
He says that literary value

576
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,550
depends on surviving
the test of time.

577
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:50,913
I want to know if it will.

578
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,452
If Luther Nichols
could answer that,

579
00:38:52,587 --> 00:38:55,522
then the Good Lord could use a
helper and he ought to be up there.

580
00:38:55,657 --> 00:38:56,589
How can he tell?

581
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:59,159
I'm asking
for his opinion as an expert.

582
00:38:59,294 --> 00:39:00,090
I'll ask him.

583
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:03,187
Can you answer the question?

584
00:39:05,267 --> 00:39:07,599
it calls for a prediction.

585
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:11,867
I think that this trial
will draw attention to it.

586
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:15,704
"Howl" will have a wider readership
than it might otherwise have had,

587
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:19,746
and may go down in history as
a stepping stone along the way

588
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,940
to greater or lesser liberality

589
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:23,813
in the permitting
of poems of its type.

590
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:41,300
Poetry, generally, is a...

591
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:44,132
rhythmic articulation of feeling

592
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,165
And the feeling is

593
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:50,039
an impulse that begins inside.

594
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:54,646
Like a sexual impulse, you know.
Almost as definite as that. it's

595
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,917
it's a feeling that begins, in
the pit of the stomach, right?

596
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:03,557
And rises up
through the breast, and...

597
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,422
out the mouth and ears, right?

598
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:08,996
And...

599
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:12,862
it comes forth as a croon
or a groan or a sigh, right?

600
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:15,499
So if you try
to put words to that

601
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:18,162
by looking around you and

602
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:21,298
trying to describe
what's making you sigh,

603
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:23,138
just sigh in words,

604
00:40:23,845 --> 00:40:26,143
you simply articulate
what you're feeling.

605
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:29,878
<i>Who bit detectives in the neck</i>
<i>and shrieked with delight</i>

606
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:32,953
<i>in police cars</i>
<i>for committing no crime,</i>

607
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:37,218
<i>but their own wild cooking</i>
<i>pederasty and intoxication.</i>

608
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:41,685
<i>Who howled</i>
<i>on their knees in the subway</i>

609
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,128
<i>and were dragged off the roof</i>

610
00:40:44,266 --> 00:40:48,066
<i>waving genitals and manuscripts.</i>

611
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:54,904
in the moment of composition,

612
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:57,441
I don't necessarily
know what it means.

613
00:40:58,313 --> 00:41:00,110
it comes to mean
something later,

614
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:01,840
after a year or two,
I come to realize

615
00:41:01,983 --> 00:41:03,143
it meant something clear,

616
00:41:03,285 --> 00:41:04,616
unconsciously.

617
00:41:05,387 --> 00:41:08,049
Which takes on meaning in time,
you know like...

618
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:10,085
a photograph developing slowly.

619
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,957
If it's at all spontaneous,

620
00:41:15,397 --> 00:41:18,195
I don't know whether it even
makes sense sometimes.

621
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,966
And other times, I do know
it makes complete sense,

622
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:25,101
I start crying.

623
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,170
'Cause I realize that I'm...

624
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:31,604
I'm hitting on an area that's...

625
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:33,446
absolutely true.

626
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:37,376
in that sense, able to be
read by someone

627
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,545
and wept to,
maybe, centuries later.

628
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,254
in that sense, prophecy,

629
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:46,524
because it touches a common key.

630
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:48,026
I mean,

631
00:41:49,197 --> 00:41:51,427
what prophecy actually is,

632
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,403
is not knowing whether...

633
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:57,972
the bomb will fall in 1942.

634
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:00,966
it's knowing
and feeling something

635
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:03,134
which someone knows and feels

636
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,742
in a hundred years. Hmm?

637
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,540
And maybe articulating it
in a hint that

638
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:13,347
they will pick up on
in a 100 years.

639
00:42:33,275 --> 00:42:35,368
<i>Who crashed through</i>
<i>their minds in jail</i>

640
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,273

<i>with golden heads</i>

682
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:18,061
After I left New York,

683
00:45:18,606 --> 00:45:20,767
I spent a year in San Francisco.

684
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:24,239
I had an apartment on Nob Hill,

685
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,612
the tie and suit,

686
00:45:27,749 --> 00:45:30,843
a job with several
secretaries which was...

687
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:32,577
beginning to give me pleasure,

688
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:35,446
the pleasure
of knowing I could do it

689
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:38,582
and was no longer intimidated
by the social forms,

690
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:42,163
to be able to make it
in the very dry, business world

691
00:45:44,899 --> 00:45:46,093
And that's when I met Peter.

692
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,861
it was when I met Peter

693
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:20,058
that everything changed for me.

694
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:26,736
it was as if the heavens
showered with gold.

695
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:32,570
Finally somebody loved me
like I loved them,

696
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:37,075
and for the first time,
I felt accepted in my life.

697
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,617
Completely.

698
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:50,296
in San Francisco,

699
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:53,628
I had a year of psychotherapy
with Dr. Hicks.

700
00:46:55,036 --> 00:46:57,197
I was blocked,
I couldn't write...

701
00:46:58,406 --> 00:47:00,237
I was still trying
to act normal.

702
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,366
I was afraid I was crazy.

703
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,377
I was sure that I was
supposed to be heterosexual

704
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:07,845
and that something
was wrong with me.

705
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:12,010
And Dr. Hicks kept saying,

706
00:47:12,153 --> 00:47:14,417
"What do you want to do?

707
00:47:14,556 --> 00:47:17,548
"What is your heart's desire?"

708
00:47:17,692 --> 00:47:19,819
Finally I said...

709
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:22,122
what I'd really like to do is to

710
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:24,527
just quit all this

711
00:47:24,766 --> 00:47:25,562
and...

712
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,565
get a small room with Peter

713
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:30,296
and devote myself
to my writing and

714
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:34,606
contemplation and fucking
and smoking pot and...

715
00:47:34,742 --> 00:47:36,733
doing whatever I want.

716
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:40,543
And he said,
"Why don't you do it, then?"

717
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:46,418
I mean, what will happen
if I grow old...

718
00:47:46,554 --> 00:47:48,522
and I have pee stains
in my underwear

719
00:47:48,656 --> 00:47:51,022
and I'm living
in some furnished room

720
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,184
and nobody loves me and I'm...

721
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,625
white haired and...

722
00:47:54,762 --> 00:47:57,196
I have no money, bread crumbs
are falling on the floor?"

723
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,731
And he said,

724
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:01,392
"Don't worry about that,

725
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:05,495
"you're very charming and lovable
and people will always love you."

726
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,870
What a relief to hear that!

727
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:11,534
I very soon realized that
it was all...

728
00:48:12,046 --> 00:48:13,308
a fear trap...

729
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:15,913
Illusory!

730
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:21,779
<i>What sphinx</i>
<i>of cement and aluminum</i>

731
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:24,289
<i>bashed open their skulls</i>

732
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:27,292
<i>and ate up</i>
<i>their brains and imagination?</i>

733
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:32,423
<i>Moloch! Solitude! Filth!</i>

734
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:36,765
<i>Ugliness! Ashcans and</i>
<i>unobtalnable dollarsl</i>

735
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,068
<i>Children screaming</i>
<i>under stairways!</i>

736
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,699
<i>Boys sobbing in armies!</i>

737
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:45,472
<i>Old men weeping in the parks!</i>

738
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:48,377
<i>Moloch! Moloch!</i>

739
00:48:48,516 --> 00:48:53,078
<i>Nightmare of Moloch!</i>
<i>Moloch the loveless!</i>

740
00:48:53,554 --> 00:48:55,385
<i>Mental Moloch!</i>

741
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:59,118
<i>Moloch the heavy judger of men!</i>

742
00:49:02,497 --> 00:49:05,830
Peter and I saw Moloch one day
when we took peyote

743
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:08,868
and were wandering around
downtown streets.

744
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,062
it's a god that you make
fire sacrifices to.

745
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:14,606
But...

746
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:18,707
in my mind, it was what
drove my mother to madness.

747
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:22,639
So, I had the line

748
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:27,250
Moloch whose eyes are
a thousand blind windows.

749
00:49:27,622 --> 00:49:29,146
I had this word,

750
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,325
And... I also had the feeling

751
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:35,895
<i>DA de de DA de de DA</i>
<i>de de DA DA.</i> Hmm?

752
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:40,967
So then all I had to do was look
up and see a lot of windows,

753
00:49:41,102 --> 00:49:43,127
and say,
"Oh, windows, of course,"

754
00:49:43,404 --> 00:49:45,838
But what kind of windows? Right?
And...

755
00:49:45,974 --> 00:49:47,839
Not only that...

756
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:50,274
"Moloch whose eyes"...Right?

757
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:53,574
"Moloch whose eyes" which
is beautiful in itself but...

758
00:49:54,315 --> 00:49:55,646
You know, what about it?

759
00:49:55,783 --> 00:49:56,875
"Moloch whose eyes" what?

760
00:49:57,018 --> 00:49:59,179
"Moloch whose eyes"...

761
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,448
Then the next thing
I thought was probably...

762
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,147
"Thousands."

763
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,952
OK, but "thousands" what?

764
00:50:05,093 --> 00:50:06,720
"Thousands blind"...

765
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:09,796
And then I had to
finish it somehow. So...

766
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,228
I had to say "windows."

767
00:50:16,904 --> 00:50:21,773
<i>Moloch whose eyes are</i>
<i>a thousand blind windows!</i>

768
00:50:23,978 --> 00:50:26,071
<i>Moloch whose skyscrapers</i>

769
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:29,706
<i>stand in the long streets</i>
<i>Like endless Jehovahs!</i>

770
00:50:31,386 --> 00:50:35,447
<i>Moloch whose factories</i>
<i>dream and croak in the fog!</i>

771
00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:42,355
<i>Moloch whose love</i>
<i>is endless oil and stone!</i>

772
00:50:44,198 --> 00:50:47,565
<i>Moloch whose soul</i>
<i>is electricity and banks!</i>

773
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:53,035
<i>Moloch whose fate is a cloud</i>
<i>of sexless hydrogen!</i>

774
00:50:54,876 --> 00:50:57,572
<i>Moloch in whom I sit lonely!</i>

775
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,914
<i>Moloch in whom I dream Angels!</i>

776
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:06,048
<i>Crazy in Moloch!</i>

777
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,481
<i>Cocksucker in Moloch!</i>

778
00:51:09,157 --> 00:51:12,217
<i>Lacklove and manless in Moloch!</i>

779
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:16,321
<i>Moloch who entered</i>
<i>my soul early!</i>

780
00:51:17,098 --> 00:51:21,467
<i>Moloch who frightened me</i>
<i>out of my natural ecstasy!</i>

781
00:51:22,036 --> 00:51:24,095
<i>Moloch whom I abandon!</i>

782
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:26,831
<i>Wake up in Moloch!</i>

783
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,938
<i>Light streaming out of the sky!</i>

784
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:34,047
<i>Moloch! Moloch!</i>

785
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:35,672
<i>Robot apartments!</i>

<i>Real holy laughter in the river!</i>

<i>They saw it all!</i>

00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:46,148
<i>The wild eyes! The holy yells!</i>

815
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,879
<i>They bade farewell!</i>

816
00:52:48,022 --> 00:52:51,150
<i>They jumped off the roof!</i>
<i>To solitude!</i>

<i>Down to the river!</i>

820
00:52:56,797 --> 00:52:58,162
<i>Into the street!</i>

821
00:52:59,734 --> 00:53:02,760
it is my opinion that if it has
any literary value,

822
00:53:02,904 --> 00:53:04,667
it's negligible.

823
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:07,501
I endeavored to arrive
at my opinion

824
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,802
on an objective basis.

825
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:09,875
For example,

826
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:14,175
a great literary work, or even
a fairly great literary work,

827
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:17,751
would obviously be
exceedingly successful in form,

828
00:53:18,219 --> 00:53:20,779
but this poem is really
just a weak imitation

829
00:53:20,922 --> 00:53:24,255
of a form that was used 80
to 90 years ago by Walt Whitman.

830
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:26,917
And do you recall
the name of that poem?

831
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:30,121
"Leaves of Grass" was
the name of the poem.

832
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:32,824
Literary value
could also reside in theme,

833
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:36,396
and what little literary value
there is in "Howl,"

834
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:38,061
it seems to me
does come in theme.

835
00:53:38,706 --> 00:53:42,198
The statement of the idea of
the poem was relatively clear,

836
00:53:42,343 --> 00:53:45,335
but it has little validity,
and, therefore, the theme

837
00:53:45,479 --> 00:53:46,946
has a negative value.

838
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:48,207
No value at all.

839
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:49,373
Thank you.

840
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:52,753
Did I understand you to say that

841
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:55,788
Ginsberg used
Walt Whitman's style?

842
00:53:55,923 --> 00:53:56,855
The form.

843
00:53:56,991 --> 00:53:59,289
The form of the book
"Leaves of Grass."

844
00:53:59,427 --> 00:54:01,759
And because of
Ginsberg's using this format,

845
00:54:01,896 --> 00:54:04,330
it is your opinion
that the poem "Howl"

846
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:06,296
has no literary value or...

847
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:08,061
merit, is that true?

848
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:10,395
On the basis of form,
that's correct,

849
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,938
because great literature
always creates

850
00:54:13,074 --> 00:54:15,201
its own form for
each significant occasion.

851
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:17,573
By that, you do not mean that

852
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,613
Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass"
doesn't quite qualify?

853
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:22,773
That is great literature.

854
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:25,078
The form was created
by Walt Whitman.

855
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:26,948
And at the same time,
you say, because

856
00:54:27,088 --> 00:54:29,056
Ginsberg copied that format,

857
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,387
"Howl" has no
value or merit, am I correct?

858
00:54:32,526 --> 00:54:33,550
That is correct.

859
00:54:33,694 --> 00:54:36,993
An imitation never does
have the value of the original.

860
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:38,758
Who did Walt Whitman copy?

861
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:41,130
To my knowledge, no one.

862
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:42,424
But you don't know,

863
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,061
isn't that your answer,
you don't know, sir?

864
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,666
That's right.

865
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:49,704
As I understand,
your next signpost

866
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,368
is that the idea

867
00:54:51,512 --> 00:54:54,242
of "Howl" is clear,
but has little validity.

868
00:54:54,382 --> 00:54:56,145
Am I quoting you correctly?

869
00:54:56,617 --> 00:54:58,642
That's the general conclusion,
yes...

870
00:54:58,786 --> 00:55:00,845
the idea of "Howl"
is clear in theme.

871
00:55:00,988 --> 00:55:02,250
The idea is clear?
Yes.

872
00:55:03,524 --> 00:55:06,049
What idea
does Ginsberg have in "Howl"?

873
00:55:06,193 --> 00:55:09,651
Well, he celebrates
the unfortunate life of...

874
00:55:11,932 --> 00:55:13,661
I can't remember the man's name,
Solomon...

875
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:16,361
the unfortunate life
of the man, Solomon,

876
00:55:16,504 --> 00:55:18,972
who is a drifter
of Dadaist persuasion.

877
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,665
A drift what?

878
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:23,100
Drifter of Dadaist persuasion.

879
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:25,371
He portrays that?

880
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:27,010
That's correct.

881
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:29,942
And does that portrayal
have any validity?

882
00:55:30,084 --> 00:55:32,211
Not as literature, no.

883
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,112
<i>Carl Solomon!</i>

884
00:55:34,689 --> 00:55:38,921

00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,590

00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,263

00:56:50,831 --> 00:56:52,196
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,733

912

<i>O vlctory</i>

917
00:57:27,668 --> 00:57:29,966
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

918
00:57:30,104 --> 00:57:31,628
<i>in my dreams</i>

919
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:34,502
<i>you walk dripping</i>

920
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:37,008

921
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:40,507
<i>in tears to the door</i>
<i>of my cottage</i>

922
00:57:40,648 --> 00:57:42,445
<i>in the Western night.</i>

923
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:50,155
What is your impression
of the third portion of "Howl"?

924
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:53,317
My understanding there would be
that the poet expresses

925
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:55,554
the usual Dadaist line that

926
00:57:55,696 --> 00:57:58,563
everything is created
for man's despair,

927
00:57:58,699 --> 00:58:01,566
that everything must be
forgotten and destroyed, and

928
00:58:01,702 --> 00:58:04,262
that Solomon's life apparently
has had this kind of rhythm.

929
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:06,305
Therefore,
there is some validity

930
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,840
of theme, in that area.

931
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:11,168
So, there is
validity of theme there?

932
00:58:12,213 --> 00:58:15,842
I am afraid I got my tongue
tripped up there... this...

933
00:58:15,983 --> 00:58:18,474
I should have said "clarity"
instead of "validity."

934
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:20,883
But you've been using
the term "validity"

935
00:58:21,021 --> 00:58:23,012
the entire time
you've been on the stand.

936
00:58:23,691 --> 00:58:25,886
By the way, Mr. Kirk,
have you read the Holy Bible?

937
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:27,954
I have.

938
00:58:28,529 --> 00:58:30,156
Tell me, did you read Job?

939
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:31,321
I have.

940
00:58:31,899 --> 00:58:35,027
Isn't Job crying the same cry
as Ginsberg's "Howl"?

941
00:58:35,169 --> 00:58:36,397
Not at all.

942
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:40,303
Do you agree with me
that Job does condemn life?

943
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:43,769
Job condemns
man's condition, yes,

944
00:58:43,911 --> 00:58:47,472
but he does not go on then,
as the Dadaist goes on, to...

945
00:58:47,615 --> 00:58:49,480
desire to wipe out
all human memory

946
00:58:49,617 --> 00:58:51,380
of everything the human race
has ever done

947
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,352
so that there can be
a fresh start made

948
00:58:54,488 --> 00:58:55,921
as the Dadaist does.

949
00:58:56,056 --> 00:58:57,387
And you don't believe
in that philosophy?

950
00:58:57,525 --> 00:58:57,957
Not at all.

951
00:58:58,225 --> 00:59:01,456
No, it's been dead
since about 1922 or '23.

952
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:03,085
But that doesn't
necessarily mean that

953
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,027
someone who does
believe that is...

954
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:06,096
wrong, does it?

955
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:09,100
No, but that does not
create literature.

956
00:59:09,236 --> 00:59:10,533
Well, what...

957
00:59:11,272 --> 00:59:13,103
What creates
literature, Mr. Kirk?

958
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:16,537
I'd have to return to my three
bases of objective criticism:

959
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:18,736
Form, theme and opportunity.

960
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:19,937
Well...

961
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,571
Do you feel that
Ginsberg had the

962
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:24,616
opportunity in his travels

963
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:26,549
to observe life
and to write about it?

964
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:28,382
A small segment, yes.

965
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:30,217
And this is the segment that
he's writing about,

966
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:31,051
isn't that right?

967
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:32,158
One thing...

968
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:34,887
Answer that question,
please, "Yes" or "No."

969
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:39,288
Uh... I'm... I'm confused.

970
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:42,428
This is the segment that
he is writing about,

971
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,229
isn't that true?

972
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,304
I can't answer that
either "Yes" or "No."

973
00:59:45,439 --> 00:59:47,066
But you said in his travels,

974
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:49,300
he wrote about a small segment
of the community.

975
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:51,572
Here's where
the confusion comes in:

976
00:59:51,712 --> 00:59:54,704
I believe the travels
are Solomon's, not Ginsberg's.

977
00:59:54,848 --> 00:59:56,372
That's the basis
of my confusion.

978
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,414
Yes, well, Ginsberg is writing
it about Solomon...

979
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:01,180
it's his own observations.

980
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:02,380
You have read that, haven't you?

981
01:00:02,723 --> 01:00:04,714
I am unable to know
whether he has

982
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:06,348
an acquaintance with Solomon.

983
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:08,927
That is the thing that is
beyond my experience,

984
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,360
beyond my knowledge.

985
01:00:10,497 --> 01:00:13,159
Do you evaluate a work
by whether the writer knew

986
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,460
the person he was talking about?

987
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:16,099
Absolutely.

988
01:00:16,236 --> 01:00:19,262
Are you certain that
Carl Solomon ever lived?

989
01:00:19,406 --> 01:00:20,031
No.

990
01:00:20,608 --> 01:00:21,905
Then you don't know, do you?

991
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:22,899
Not at all.

992
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:26,879
Have you ever read... Voltaire?

993
01:00:27,848 --> 01:00:28,780
I've read one work,

994
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:29,811
"Candide."

995
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:31,508
And what is your opinion
of "Candide"?

996
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:34,052
As literature?
it's great literature.

997
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:36,482
And whose style
did Voltaire copy?

998
01:00:36,624 --> 01:00:37,249
Oh!

999
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:37,982
Your Honor!

1000
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:38,614
Please!

1001
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:40,689
Counsel is allowed
to make an objection.

1002
01:00:40,828 --> 01:00:42,352
If he objects.

1003
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,989
Well, I would like to...

1004
01:00:46,567 --> 01:00:49,001
I don't want to box with him.

1005
01:00:49,136 --> 01:00:50,831
He's disturbing me.

1006
01:00:51,739 --> 01:00:54,606
I get my mouth open
and out fly fists.

1007
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:04,517
How long have you
reflected on "Howl"?

1008
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:06,948
I believe two weeks.

1009
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:08,145
Two weeks?

1010
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:10,381
Two weeks would be
the limit of my opportunity.

1011
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:12,822
However, I made my mind up
after 5 minutes.

1012
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,258
And you reflected
a long, long time

1013
01:01:15,396 --> 01:01:17,296
on Voltaire's "Candide,"
is that right?

1014
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:18,523
Exactly.

1015
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:20,725
Well, do you think that
if you had another

1016
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:22,665
ten years to reflect on "Howl,"

1017
01:01:22,803 --> 01:01:24,498
you might change your opinion?

1018
01:01:24,638 --> 01:01:26,902
I am quite certain I would not.

1019
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:30,632
That is all.

1020
01:01:32,312 --> 01:01:34,644
<i>... where you accuse</i>
<i>your doctors of insanity</i>

1021
01:01:34,782 --> 01:01:37,182

<i>socialist revolution</i>

1022
01:01:37,317 --> 01:01:40,252

01:02:14,354 --> 01:02:15,787
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

1035
01:02:16,457 --> 01:02:20,086
<i>where we wake up electrified</i>
<i>out of the coma</i>

1036
01:02:20,227 --> 01:02:23,856
<i>by our own souls'</i>
<i>airplanes roaring over the roof</i>

1037
01:02:23,997 --> 01:02:27,763
<i>they've come to drop</i>
<i>angelic bombs</i>

1038
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,868
<i>the hospital illuminates Itself</i>

1039
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:34,371
<i>imaginary walls collapse</i>

1040
01:02:34,641 --> 01:02:38,338
<i>O skinny legions run outside</i>

1041
01:02:38,612 --> 01:02:41,809
<i>O starry spangled shock of mercy</i>

1042
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:44,611
<i>the eternal war is here!</i>

1043
01:02:44,752 --> 01:02:46,379
<i>O vlctoryl</i>

1044
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,415
<i>Forget your underwear!</i>

1045
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:50,022
<i>We're free!</i>

1046
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,390
<i>I'm with you in Rockland</i>

1047
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:55,690
<i>in my dreams</i>

1048
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:58,389
<i>you walk dripping</i>
<i>from a sea journey</i>

1049
01:02:58,532 --> 01:03:00,830
<i>on the highway across America</i>

1050
01:03:00,968 --> 01:03:04,961
<i>in tears to the door</i>
<i>of my cottage</i>

1051
01:03:05,105 --> 01:03:07,164
<i>in the Western night.</i>

1052
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,345
"Howl" contains words,

1053
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:22,978
taken just by themselves,
Your Honor,

1054
01:03:23,123 --> 01:03:25,387
that are definitely obscene.

1055
01:03:25,626 --> 01:03:28,686
And we have had different
literary experts testify that

1056
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:32,663
the books have literary merit,
and that the words

1057
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,496
are necessary to that
so called merit.

1058
01:03:37,437 --> 01:03:40,201
But it's funny in our law,

1059
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,898
we are allowed to use

1060
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:44,738
expert witnesses
to testify as to literary merit,

1061
01:03:44,878 --> 01:03:47,506
but we are not allowed
to bring in,

1062
01:03:47,648 --> 01:03:49,878
we will say, the average man

1063
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:52,542
to testify that when
he reads the book,

1064
01:03:52,686 --> 01:03:54,278
he doesn't understand it.

1065
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:57,015
He doesn't know
what it's all about.

1066
01:03:57,624 --> 01:03:59,683
Perhaps it's over his head.

1067
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:02,354
Take, for example...

1068
01:04:04,565 --> 01:04:08,399
Frankly, and I made the comment
in open court that I'd read it,

1069
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:11,295
I don't understand it very well.

1070
01:04:11,438 --> 01:04:13,668
in fact, looking it all over,

1071
01:04:13,807 --> 01:04:16,537
I think it's a lot of
sensitive bullshit,

1072
01:04:16,677 --> 01:04:19,043
using the language
of Mr. Ginsberg.

1073
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,739
So then,

1074
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:24,973
If the sale of a book
is not being limited to just

1075
01:04:25,118 --> 01:04:26,449
modern book reviewers

1076
01:04:26,587 --> 01:04:28,521
and experts on modern poetry,

1077
01:04:28,655 --> 01:04:30,987
but falls into the hands
of the general public,

1078
01:04:31,124 --> 01:04:33,820
that is to say,
the average reader,

1079
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:36,955
this court should take that
into consideration

1080
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:40,260
in determining whether or not
"Howl" is obscene.

1081
01:04:40,968 --> 01:04:42,435
Thank you, Your Honor

1082
01:04:43,904 --> 01:04:44,700
Alright...

1083
01:04:44,838 --> 01:04:46,328
I will hear from the defense.

1084
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,842
The United States Supreme Court
has said that obscenity

1085
01:04:56,783 --> 01:04:58,341
is construed to mean

1086
01:04:58,986 --> 01:05:01,853
"having a
substantial tendency to corrupt

1087
01:05:01,989 --> 01:05:04,583
"by arousing lustful desires."

1088
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:11,529
is the word relevant to what
the author is trying to say,

1089
01:05:12,065 --> 01:05:15,296
or did he just use it
to be dirty and filthy?

1090
01:05:15,936 --> 01:05:19,235
He sees what he terms as

1091
01:05:19,706 --> 01:05:22,800
"an Adonis of Denver,
joy to the memory

1092
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,377
"of his innumerable conquests.

1093
01:05:25,512 --> 01:05:28,174
<i>Who went out</i>
<i>whoring through Colorado</i>

1094
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:31,341
<i>in myriad stolen night cars</i>

1095
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:36,388
<i>Neal Cassady,</i>
<i>secret hero of this poem,</i>

1096
01:05:36,523 --> 01:05:39,151
<i>cocksman and Adonis of Denver,</i>

1097
01:05:39,593 --> 01:05:43,893
<i>joy to the memory</i>
<i>of his Innumerable lays of girls</i>

1098
01:05:44,031 --> 01:05:47,467
<i>in empty lots</i>
<i>and diner backyards,</i>

1099
01:05:47,601 --> 01:05:50,195
<i>moviehouses' rickety rows,</i>

1100
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:55,206
<i>on mountaintops in caves</i>
<i>or with gaunt waitresses</i>

1101
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:59,745
<i>in familiar roadside</i>
<i>lonely petticoat upliftings</i>

1102
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,011
<i>and especially secret</i>
<i>gas station solipsisms of johns,</i>

1103
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:07,382
<i>and hometown alleys too.</i>

1104
01:06:07,788 --> 01:06:10,848
Now, I suppose
he could have said that,

1105
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:13,084
the secret hero of these poems,

1106
01:06:13,226 --> 01:06:16,684
this "cocksman,"
this "Adonis of Denver,"

1107
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:20,459
joy to memory
of his innumerable conquests

1108
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,897
at the Waldorf Astoria...

1109
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:25,330
or at dinner at Chasen's,
or after one or two drinks,

1110
01:06:25,472 --> 01:06:27,804
in going to bed
at the Stork Club.

1111
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:30,701
I presume
he could have said that...

1112
01:06:30,844 --> 01:06:32,744
but that isn't
the kind of person

1113
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:34,710
he is writing about.

1114
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:37,742
it is not for us
to choose the words.

1115
01:06:38,352 --> 01:06:40,582
Mr. Ginsberg,
in telling his story,

1116
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:42,484
is telling the story
as he sees it.

1117
01:06:42,622 --> 01:06:44,385
He is using his words.

1118
01:06:45,058 --> 01:06:47,049
There are books that
have the power to change

1119
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:48,559
men's minds,

1120
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:51,295
and call attention
to situations that...

1121
01:06:51,765 --> 01:06:52,823
are visible but

1122
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:53,996
unseen.

1123
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:58,665
Now whether "Howl" is
or is not "obscene" is of

1124
01:06:59,172 --> 01:07:02,505
little importance to our world,
faced as it is with the threat

1125
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:04,371
of physical survival,

1126
01:07:05,245 --> 01:07:05,904
but...

1127
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:08,944
the problem of what is
legally permissible

1128
01:07:09,082 --> 01:07:12,017
in the description of
sexual acts or feelings

1129
01:07:12,152 --> 01:07:15,087
in arts and literature
is of the greatest importance

1130
01:07:15,222 --> 01:07:17,156
to a free society.

1131
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,755
What is "prurient"?

1132
01:07:20,227 --> 01:07:21,819
And to whom?

1133
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:25,298
And the material so described
is dangerous to some

1134
01:07:25,432 --> 01:07:27,457
unspecified, susceptible reader.

1135
01:07:28,135 --> 01:07:29,363
it is interesting that

1136
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,869
the person applying
such standards of censorship

1137
01:07:32,005 --> 01:07:34,371
rarely feels as if their own

1138
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,999
physical or moral health
is in jeopardy.

1139
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:39,438
The desire to censor is...

1140
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:42,574
not limited, however,
to crackpots and bigots.

1141
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:43,910
There is...

1142
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,444
in most of us, a desire to

1143
01:07:46,953 --> 01:07:49,615
make the world conform
to our own views.

1144
01:07:49,756 --> 01:07:52,748
And it takes all of the force
of our own reason as well as

1145
01:07:52,893 --> 01:07:56,420
our legal institutions
to defy so human an urge.

1146
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:59,198
The battle of censorship
will not be

1147
01:07:59,332 --> 01:08:01,766
finally settled by
Your Honor's decision,

1148
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:06,032
but you will either add
to liberal, educated thinking,

1149
01:08:06,306 --> 01:08:08,831
or by your decision,
you will add fuel

1150
01:08:08,975 --> 01:08:10,909
to the fire of ignorance.

1151
01:08:12,979 --> 01:08:14,640
Let there be light.

1152
01:08:16,116 --> 01:08:18,175
Let there be honesty.

1153
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:20,814
Let there be no running from

1154
01:08:20,954 --> 01:08:24,481
non existent
destroyers of morals.

1155
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:28,784
Let there be
honest understanding.

1156
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:35,533
Gentleman,
is the matter submitted?

1157
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:38,464
it is submitted, Your Honor.

1158
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,402
it is so submitted.

1159
01:09:13,006 --> 01:09:14,371
All rise.

1160
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:21,207
Be seated.

1161
01:09:29,322 --> 01:09:32,951
There are a number of words
used in "Howl"

1162
01:09:33,093 --> 01:09:36,119
that are presently considered
coarse and vulgar

1163
01:09:36,263 --> 01:09:38,231
in some circles
of the community,

1164
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:41,801
and in other circles,
such words are in everyday use.

1165
01:09:42,202 --> 01:09:44,227
The author of "Howl"

1166
01:09:44,371 --> 01:09:46,498
has used those words
because he believed that

1167
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,007
his portrayal required them
as being in character.

1168
01:09:50,143 --> 01:09:53,943
The People state that such words
are not necessary

1169
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,574
and that others would be
more palatable for good taste.

1170
01:09:59,186 --> 01:10:03,850
The answer is that life is not
encased in one formula

1171
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:05,924
whereby everyone acts the same

1172
01:10:06,059 --> 01:10:08,687
and conforms
to a particular pattern.

1173
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:11,930
No two persons think alike.

1174
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:14,363
We were all made
from the same form

1175
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:16,760
but in different patterns.

1176
01:10:17,103 --> 01:10:19,594
Would there be any freedoms
of press or speech

1177
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,003
if one must reduce
his vocabulary

1178
01:10:22,142 --> 01:10:24,337
to vapid, innocuous euphemism?

1179
01:10:24,477 --> 01:10:28,208
An author should be real
in treating his subject

1180
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:30,578
and be allowed to express
his thoughts

1181
01:10:30,717 --> 01:10:32,947
and ideas in his own words.

1182
01:10:33,587 --> 01:10:36,283
in considering material
claimed to be obscene,

1183
01:10:36,423 --> 01:10:38,482
it is well
to remember the motto,

1184
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,616
"Honi soit qui mal y pense"

1185
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:43,988
"Evil to him who evil thinks."

1186
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:46,758
The freedoms of speech and press

1187
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,198
are inherent
in a nation of free people.

1188
01:10:49,336 --> 01:10:53,432
These freedoms must be protected
if we are to remain free,

1189
01:10:53,573 --> 01:10:56,303
both individually
and as a nation.

1190
01:10:57,477 --> 01:11:00,674
Therefore, I conclude that
the book "Howl and Other Poems"

1191
01:11:00,814 --> 01:11:04,045
does have some redeeming
social importance,

1192
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:06,908
and I find the book
is not obscene.

1193
01:11:07,287 --> 01:11:09,517
The defendant
is found not guilty.

1194
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:37,708
The crucial moment
of breakthrough came when

1195
01:11:38,418 --> 01:11:40,613
I realized
how funny it would be,

1196
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,585
in the middle of a long poem,

1197
01:11:42,722 --> 01:11:44,485
if I said:

1198
01:11:45,191 --> 01:11:47,182
"Who let themselves
be fucked in the ass

1199
01:11:47,327 --> 01:11:49,022
"and screamed with joy!"

1200
01:11:49,162 --> 01:11:51,289
Instead of
"and screamed with pain."

1201
01:11:51,431 --> 01:11:53,365
That's the contradiction
in that line.

1202
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,264
An American audience would
expect it to be pain and,

1203
01:11:56,403 --> 01:11:58,098
instead,
it's "screamed with joy!"

1204
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:00,433
Which is really true.

1205
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:02,234
Absolutely, 100%.

1206
01:12:03,276 --> 01:12:06,040
And, again, I have a line, like

1207
01:12:07,881 --> 01:12:10,748
"Who blew and were blown
by those human seraphim,

1208
01:12:10,884 --> 01:12:12,545
the sailors, caresses of

1209
01:12:12,686 --> 01:12:14,551
"Atlantic and Caribbean love."

1210
01:12:16,923 --> 01:12:18,322
it was
an acknowledgement of the

1211
01:12:18,458 --> 01:12:21,393
basic reality of homosexual joy.

1212
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:25,290
That was a breakthrough
in the sense of

1213
01:12:25,932 --> 01:12:27,559
public statements about

1214
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:30,534
feelings, emotions,
attitudes, you know,

1215
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:32,095
that...

1216
01:12:33,506 --> 01:12:37,465
I wouldn't have wanted
my father or my family to see,

1217
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:41,078
and that I even
hesitated to make public.

1218
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:49,312
The poem is misinterpreted as...

1219
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,886
a promotion of homosexuality.

1220
01:12:52,258 --> 01:12:55,352
Actually, it's...
more like a promotion of

1221
01:12:55,495 --> 01:12:58,259
frankness, about any subject.

1222
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:03,269
If you're a foot fetishist,
you write about feet.

1223
01:13:03,403 --> 01:13:06,133
If you're a stock market freak,

1224
01:13:06,272 --> 01:13:09,833
you can write about
the rising sales curve erections

1225
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:12,035
of the Standard Oil chart.

1226
01:13:13,546 --> 01:13:16,845
When a few people are...

1227
01:13:16,983 --> 01:13:18,814
frank about
homosexuality in public,

1228
01:13:18,952 --> 01:13:20,283
it breaks the ice.

1229
01:13:21,087 --> 01:13:24,750
Then people are free
to be frank about anything and...

1230
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:28,618
That's socially useful.

1231
01:13:37,504 --> 01:13:39,529
Homosexuality is a condition,

1232
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,840
and because it alienated me

1233
01:13:42,976 --> 01:13:44,705
or set me apart
from the beginning,

1234
01:13:44,844 --> 01:13:48,974
it served as a catalyst
for self examination,

1235
01:13:49,115 --> 01:13:50,377
or...

1236
01:13:51,217 --> 01:13:54,812
a detailed realization
of my environment and...

1237
01:13:55,588 --> 01:14:00,753
the reasons why
everyone else is different and

1238
01:14:02,862 --> 01:14:04,693
why I am different.

1239
01:14:23,016 --> 01:14:26,577
<i>Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!</i>

1240
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,177
<i>Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!</i>

<i>The skin is holy!</i>

<i>The nose is holy!</i>

1246
01:14:44,571 --> 01:14:48,530
<i>The tongue and cock</i>
<i>and hand and asshole, holy!</i>

1247
01:14:48,675 --> 01:14:50,199
<i>Everything is holy!</i>

1248
01:14:50,443 --> 01:14:52,172
<i>Everybody's holy!</i>

1249
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:54,073
<i>Everywhere is holy!</i>

1250
01:14:54,314 --> 01:14:56,748
<i>Everyday is an eternity!</i>

1251
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:58,908
<i>Everyman's an angel!</i>

1252
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:01,745
<i>The bum's as holy</i>
<i>as the seraphim!</i>

1253
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:07,622
<i>The madman is holy</i>
<i>as you my soul are holy!</i>

1254
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:09,351
<i>The typewriter is holy!</i>

1255
01:15:09,496 --> 01:15:11,088
<i>The poem is holy!</i>

1256
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,698
<i>The vole is holy!</i>

1257
01:15:12,832 --> 01:15:14,561
<i>The hearers are holy!</i>

1258
01:15:14,701 --> 01:15:16,931
<i>The ecstasy is holy!</i>

1259
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:18,696
