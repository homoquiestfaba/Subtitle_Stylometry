1
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:38,670
Holy...

2
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,454
oh. Whoa.

3
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:22,247
I was thinking if you need money
you can use my credit card.

4
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,682
What?
I got it under control.

5
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:28,485
Sure you don't want to come
and stay at my place tonight?

6
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:32,162
I'd like to, but I'll be
up all night studying.

7
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,697
Now get out of here.

8
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:19,631
Marcus sent me
to get the money.

9
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,900
You cannot be showing up
to my fucking house like this.

10
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,006
- I need more time.
- Marcus said to get the money tonight

11
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:31,777
or he's going to pay himself
at your girlfriend's house.

12
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:34,645
Listen to me.

13
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,549
You leave her the fuck
out of this.

14
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,754
Oh, I'm just the messenger.

15
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,819
Get us the fucking money.

16
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,430
Jesus.

17
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,097
Cool.

18
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:08,435
No.

19
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:13,638
My husband liked
to collect awful things.

20
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,207
Take it to the dump
with everything else.

21
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,609
- You know I can sell this...
- young man,

22
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,645
when you take this
to the landfill

23
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,517
promise me
you'll watch them bury it.

24
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,483
Yeah okay.

25
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,222
Sorry, ma'am,
but one man's trash

26
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:07,103
is another man's treasure.

27
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,043
Cooler than I thought.

28
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,753
What?

29
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:43,799
Shit.

30
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,244
- What is it, man?
- Get your shit together. You gotta see this.

31
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:08,182
All right.

32
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,822
Wow.

33
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,361
- What the hell is it?
- I don't know.

34
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,363
What's that?

35
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,269
It's a key.

36
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,876
- Is that an engraving?
- Yeah.

37
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:42,178
"Von tristen, 1452."

38
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,981
Dude, we might have
a real antique here.

39
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,082
Come over here.

40
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,984
Check this out, dude.

41
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:50,687
I think I figured out
where the key goes.

42
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:52,094
Give me that.

43
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:13,851
That's creepy.

44
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,855
What happened?

45
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,860
Why would someone put a
music box in a coffin?

46
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,362
I don't know.

47
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,284
But I'm going to bed.

48
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:56,320
So you're thinking post-modern
philosophy... ambitious.

49
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,190
I like it. Right here. First few
chapters are a little slow.

50
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,992
Mid-way through it picks up, but
the ending... change your life.

51
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:03,994
Okay, I'll take a look.

52
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:05,133
Come over.

53
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:10,367
Skinner was asking
about you in class today,

54
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,969
wondering if you dropped out.

55
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,937
Yeah, I slept right through it.

56
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,106
The harder I try,
the worse I do.

57
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,808
- I wish I could help, man.
- Show me what you found.

58
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,879
Wolfgang Von tristen.

59
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,915
Frankfurt, 1412.

60
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,018
Builder of torture devices.

61
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:28,786
I saw that already.

62
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,955
There's no mention
of coffins...

63
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,269
- of any kind.
- Right this way.

64
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,509
"Age of darkness."

65
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,311
This guy was like an evil
version of Leonardo Da Vinci.

66
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:57,281
They called him
the devil's craftsman.

67
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,452
That's it.

68
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,286
"Idolon machina.

69
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:05,489
Von tristen was fascinated with
death and the worlds beyond.

70
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,825
The later part of his years
were spent creating

71
00:12:07,826 --> 00:12:10,393
the ultimate machine...
a mechanical coffin

72
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:14,098
that allowed him to safely
experience the sensation of death.

73
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:17,033
Von tristen called this
'geist maschine'...

74
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,408
ghost machine."

75
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,875
How much you think it's worth?

76
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,510
Thousands?
Millions?

77
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:30,283
Collectors would kill
for something like that.

78
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:35,051
Hey... the book's not allowed
out of the archive!

79
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:37,423
You're gonna set off the alarm.

80
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,196
Glad to be of assistance.

81
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,076
Dude, what the hell
are you doing?

82
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,912
I just replaced a couple
of pins in the music box.

83
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,522
It should work fine.

84
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:12,989
Easy, man.
What's up?

85
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,927
Read this.

86
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,262
"Von tristen's ghost machine.

87
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:19,930
This coffin-like device

88
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,099
is said to produce
an out-of-body experience

89
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,068
similar to the first
moments of death.

90
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,071
Von tristen was accused of
sorcery and burned at the stake.

91
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,374
Although sketches of the coffin
were recovered from his laboratory,

92
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,311
- an actual prototype was never found."
- Until now.

93
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,349
No way.

94
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,284
Grab minnie.

95
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,505
You'd better not hurt
my goldfish, man.

96
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:44,447
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

97
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,617
Wait wait wait wait.

98
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,520
Just give it a sec.

99
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,957
Minnie's dead.

100
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,301
Oh ho!

101
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:04,538
I can't believe it.

102
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,140
Hey.

103
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,645
Call platt.

104
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,654
Kyle!

105
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:25,224
Why are you beeping?

106
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,292
- Honk honk.
- Hey.

107
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,065
What's up?

108
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:36,369
So what's the surprise?

109
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,470
Ah, that is exactly
what I needed.

110
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,538
What happened to your neck?

111
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,207
It's a hickey from Gina.

112
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,176
What?

113
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:49,513
She tried to roundhouse me
in kickboxing class,

114
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,581
but I kicked her ass.

115
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:54,484
Ohhh, that's my girl.

116
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:58,422
# ...the night as it
cuts before #

117
00:15:58,423 --> 00:16:03,260
# whatever we're going thru
just want to be with you... #

118
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,398
Kyle, the gas company
just called.

119
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,634
They're going to shut off the
gas if we don't pay the bill.

120
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,335
Not now, Sutton!

121
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:15,642
Sure, I'll take care
of the bill.

122
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:20,745
Just like I did last month.

123
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:24,281
When are you moving
into a new place?

124
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:26,086
I am not moving
into a new place.

125
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,619
I got an awesome bathroom

126
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,836
and Sutton pays for everything.

127
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:47,706
Hi, Julie.

128
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:51,485
Hi, Sutton.

129
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,347
Yeah, thanks.

130
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:39,492
Sutton, will you get the door?

131
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:42,826
Hey, platt.

132
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:45,906
Well?
Let's see this thing.

133
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,807
Interesting.

134
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,748
Wait till you see the inside.

135
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:05,516
Amazing.

136
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,317
- Wanna go for a ride?
- I wanna run some tests first.

137
00:18:08,318 --> 00:18:09,620
You scared?

138
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,288
I'm careful.

139
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,827
- How about you, sutt?
- Yeah right.

140
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:18,795
It didn't hurt the fish.

141
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:22,433
Um, there's a big difference between
a goldfish and a human being.

142
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:25,172
All right, it's gotta be me.

143
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,172
Hey, do I have to remind you
this was built

144
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:30,941
by an expert
in torture machines?

145
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,943
- With some help from the devil.
- Wait? Huh, what?

146
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:35,948
Just kidding.

147
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,316
If you see spikes
shooting out of the sides,

148
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:41,288
pull me out.

149
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,956
October 10th,

150
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:48,828
Kyle Baker enters
the ghost machine.

151
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:55,201
Three turns should put Kyle
in a trance for about a minute.

152
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,335
Kyle,

153
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,941
- are you afraid?
- Just turn the key.

154
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:35,905
What's going on?

155
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,908
I don't know.

156
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,912
Ha ha ha. Kyle, you can
quit pretending now.

157
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,412
Dude,

158
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,484
I don't think he's joking.

159
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:49,620
He's... he's not breathing.
This is not good.

160
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,990
I'm not okay. This is not okay.
This is not okay.

161
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,290
- Huh-uh.
- Careful.

162
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,958
- Come on, Kyle.
- I don't know if you can touch him.

163
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,929
- Kyle, wake up!
- Easy, okay.

164
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:08,337
- No no, Kyle, Kyle.
- It's okay.

165
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:10,731
One minute.
Come on.

166
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,967
No, we need to wake
him up right now!

167
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:39,470
Just let the music end!

168
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,373
- Ooh ooh!
- Holy shit!

169
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,012
You scared the hell out of me!

170
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,784
One minute, five seconds.

171
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,952
- Tell us what happened, man.
- Man!

172
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,655
Dude, do you remember anything?

173
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:01,696
Come on, what the hell, man!?
- Say something.

174
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:07,682
Wow.

175
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:27,084
It was like...

176
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,786
Virtual reality.

177
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,422
You're there, but you're not.

178
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:34,557
You mean like a dream?

179
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:36,826
No, it's more like

180
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:39,565
being invisible.

181
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,966
I wish you could
tell me more, man.

182
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,502
Try it for yourself.

183
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,575
I shouldn't do this.

184
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,079
Yeah, platt,
I thought you were smart.

185
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,020
I'm cursed with curiosity.

186
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,692
You're gonna be fine.

187
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,793
Relax.

188
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:11,172
Bon voyage.

189
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,824
Ahh!

190
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,028
- Easy, man.
- Chill, dude. We got you.

191
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:20,498
Thank God! Get me out of this thing!
Get me out!

192
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,132
What the hell happened to you?

193
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,668
I don't think my experience
was as enjoyable as yours.

194
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,070
No, this isn't good. I do not
like this at all! Not one bit!

195
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:30,806
Not one bit. It's evil,
I don't like it! It's not good!

196
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,741
Dude, dude!

197
00:23:32,742 --> 00:23:34,978
What do you think
it's doing to us?

198
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,948
It's an n.D.E....

199
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,649
a near-death experience.

200
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,918
We seem to be approaching
the threshold of death

201
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,022
without actually crossing over.

202
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,258
You all right?

203
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:51,195
Do you need a breather?

204
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:54,096
You want some water?

205
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:55,934
I'm next!

206
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,876
I was hoping you'd say that.

207
00:24:05,876 --> 00:24:07,877
I really think
this is a bad idea.

208
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:09,613
It's gonna be fine, platt.

209
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,547
Sutton, when you go under

210
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,985
I need you to read
the words on this card,

211
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,255
so that I'll know
we're not dreaming.

212
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,739
- You understand?
- Yeah.

213
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:02,805
My God.

214
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:10,105
Kyle! Kyle!

215
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,775
Shit. Listen,

216
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,916
I need you
to keep an eye on him.

217
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,985
What's going on?

218
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:23,853
I came to show you something.

219
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,022
When I offered you
my credit card yesterday,

220
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,324
I didn't know you had already
been using it for a month!

221
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:30,092
Oh come on, I was going
to pay you back.

222
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,893
- Look, I can't talk about this.
- What are you thinking?

223
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:33,631
I can't talk
about this right now!

224
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,602
Oh my God! What the
hell is going on, Kyle?

225
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,102
Something big is going down.

226
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,710
I will call you tonight
to explain all of this.

227
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,816
Unbelievable.

228
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,757
That's platt's scooter.

229
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:01,272
Great.

230
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,116
Holy shit!

231
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,817
- What did I tell you?
- I was walking.

232
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:30,920
What was written on the card?

233
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,660
Sometimes, I dream
that I'm walking.

234
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,293
But never like that.

235
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:39,163
- What was written on the card?
- What?

236
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,833
- The card.
- I don't know.

237
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,202
Maybe we were just dreaming.

238
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,306
Steal your girlfriend's
credit card, huh?

239
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:51,306
That's pretty low, man.

240
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,209
You were out there?

241
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,015
Sneaky little bastard.

242
00:26:58,015 --> 00:26:59,382
And you...

243
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,851
you might want to go look
at your scooter, dude.

244
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:03,787
Julie can really kick.

245
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,991
Wait, what?

246
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:10,359
This is bigger than
anything else I've ever known.

247
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,797
This is bigger than lasers.
This is bigger than...

248
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,899
this is crazy. We're on a
canyon of unknowing, guys.

249
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,401
Look, some art collector
finds out about this,

250
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:21,938
some criminal, the police,
it'll be gone by morning.

251
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,074
So it's our secret, okay?

252
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,375
And no more using the machine.

253
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,444
Not until I do
some more research.

254
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:30,482
Seems perfectly safe.

255
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:34,084
Look!

256
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,059
- Whoa!
- Whoa whoa whoa.

257
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,997
- I was standing.
- You were falling.

258
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:49,098
You saw it!

259
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:51,034
I felt my legs.

260
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:52,808
That's impossible.

261
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:01,380
The feeling is gone now.

262
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,216
Look, we've got
something powerful here

263
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,918
and we have absolutely no idea
what it's doing to our bodies.

264
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:11,954
I want to do some more research
before we use it again. Agreed?

265
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,957
I'm ready to go
back in right now.

266
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,526
- No! No, you're not. No.
- Easy!

267
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,198
We'll get there.

268
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:23,367
Agreed.

269
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:25,108
Sutton?

270
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:34,993
I felt my legs.

271
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,855
Excuse me, sir?

272
00:29:57,361 --> 00:30:00,111
Come on, pooch.
Good boy.

273
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,912
This relationship
isn't working.

274
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:52,315
I need more than casual sex.

275
00:30:52,316 --> 00:30:55,020
I want some time off.

276
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,222
Either we take two weeks off
from each other or...

277
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:02,028
We can end it right now.

278
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,129
Two weeks.

279
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,037
I love you, Kyle, but I really
don't like you right now.

280
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:22,698
Of course.

281
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,034
I thought I might have
seen you tonight.

282
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:54,342
I've got your money.

283
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,413
Jerrod,

284
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,059
get the schoolboy some tea.

285
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:19,895
Why are you messing
with all this stuff anyway?

286
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:23,366
Ain't they got beers
or cigarettes at your school?

287
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,035
Yeah. It was helping
me study harder.

288
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:29,375
Now it's just helping.

289
00:38:47,556 --> 00:38:49,931
Let me show you something.

290
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,401
You know, smoking is fine...

291
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,905
if you want to lose your teeth.

292
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:04,077
Real pros shoot their crystal.

293
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,812
Maximize the effects.

294
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:13,824
Saves money.

295
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,994
I'm not that desperate.

296
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,642
There you go, buddy.

297
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:42,449
Have fun.

298
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,755
Wait a minute.

299
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:55,124
Ow!
What the fuck?!

300
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:58,060
Just 'cause you go to college
doesn't mean you don't follow

301
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,763
the same rules as
the other junkies, okay?

302
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:05,533
From now on you pay as you go.

303
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:09,764
- I'm not a fucking junkie.
- Just wait till you start losing your teeth.

304
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:33,881
- Yeah. I got some
info on the music box.

305
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:36,019
- What time is it?
- It's almost noon.

306
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:39,221
Shouldn't you be in class?

307
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:41,823
Shit.

308
00:42:41,824 --> 00:42:44,692
- What did you find out?
- It relies on the diminished fifth,

309
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,162
also known as
diabolus en musica,

310
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,397
a tonal interval banned
by the medieval church

311
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:51,001
because it was considered
to be satanic.

312
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,235
I want to record the music
so I can study it further.

313
00:42:54,236 --> 00:42:56,170
I don't understand
a word you're saying, platt.

314
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:58,081
Just don't touch anything.
I'll be there at 6:00.

315
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,864
This stuff goes way too quick.

316
00:43:21,864 --> 00:43:24,899
A lot of religions believe
in the power of sound.

317
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,870
The vedics believed that the universe
was created by sonic vibrations

318
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:31,083
and will be destroyed
the same way.

319
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,121
Uh, how you guys feeling?

320
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:46,224
Fine.

321
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:52,261
You guys haven't had any problems
since we used the coffin last night?

322
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,363
Nosebleeds, headaches,
that sort of thing?

323
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:55,863
Nope.

324
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,471
How about your legs, sutt?

325
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,939
Nothing.

326
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,774
Must have been a nervous
reaction before.

327
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:09,078
It happens.

328
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,946
Have you seen anything strange?

329
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:15,350
Hallucinations,
hot flashes, nightmares?

330
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:16,919
I slept like a baby.

331
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,056
Me too.

332
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:22,991
I saw something horrible.

333
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:25,794
It looked just like this.

334
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:28,766
Scared me half to death.

335
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:31,735
You were really
freaked out yesterday.

336
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:34,507
This thing's gotta mess
with your head a little.

337
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:40,776
Tonight

338
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:43,312
- I'm going for maximum duration.
- Wait wait wait.

339
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,848
Wait just a minute. I'm here to
do the sound and nothing else.

340
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,052
Don't touch me.

341
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:52,955
Fine.

342
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,463
Listen, you guys don't tell me
what to do with my machine.

343
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:04,832
Kyle Baker enters the ghost
machine for the second time.

344
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,268
Tell us what you're
going to do, man.

345
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:09,471
- Why?
- For the marketing video.

346
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:12,274
That's nobody's business

347
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,188
but my own.

348
00:45:35,331 --> 00:45:37,065
Come on, man.
Time's up.

349
00:45:42,038 --> 00:45:44,842
Stop it!

350
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:49,152
Stop it!

351
00:45:57,152 --> 00:46:00,321
You know, man?
Your girlfriend

352
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:02,960
ain't half bad.

353
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,493
Doesn't move much,

354
00:46:05,494 --> 00:46:07,943
but you can do anything
you want with her.

355
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,076
Just give me my stuff.

356
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:25,505
Give them what they came for.

357
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:52,411
Thanks, jerrod. I knew you
were good for something.

358
00:46:56,411 --> 00:46:58,046
Are you okay?

359
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,249
I feel good.
Real good.

360
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,185
Come on, man.
Tell us where you went.

361
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:06,120
The gates of heaven.

362
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:08,034
Come on.

363
00:47:18,034 --> 00:47:19,935
You guys gonna help me out?

364
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:22,184
You guys might want
to take a look at something.

365
00:47:36,184 --> 00:47:38,025
Goldfish die all the time.

366
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,010
- Take me to the Max.
- You guys are tweaked.

367
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,695
Good night, fellas.

368
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:08,179
See you in class tomorrow.

369
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:11,680
What?

370
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:14,448
- I miss him already.
- Oh.

371
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:17,785
You should just get it
over with and leave him.

372
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:20,622
He used to be different...
like really sweet.

373
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:22,624
After college we were
gonna go to Europe

374
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:25,192
to see the castles.

375
00:49:25,193 --> 00:49:27,032
You're such a sucker for their
romantic bullshit, aren't you?

376
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,600
No.
No no no.

377
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:33,334
Don't answer it.

378
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:37,106
I'll just tell him
to stop calling me.

379
00:49:38,106 --> 00:49:39,411
Okay.

380
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,511
Julie, please don't
hang up on me.

381
00:49:43,512 --> 00:49:46,680
I meant it when I said
I needed time off, Kyle.

382
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:48,649
I know.

383
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,053
But I got some great news
for you.

384
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,687
What?

385
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:56,760
I have to tell you in person.
I got something to show you.

386
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,593
You're burning me out, Kyle.

387
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:02,196
Meet me tomorrow at the
cafe near your house.

388
00:50:02,197 --> 00:50:04,265
It'll be worth it, promise you.

389
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:06,442
- Noon?
- Okay.

390
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:15,713
I love you, Kyle.

391
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:20,592
No!

392
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:30,826
Whoa.

393
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,099
How are you feeling?

394
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,265
I never felt better.

395
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:41,403
Where were you, man?
The audience wants to know.

396
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:44,641
I snuck into a movie theater.

397
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:47,808
Must have been a good movie.

398
00:50:47,809 --> 00:50:50,547
Look, I'm sorry.

399
00:50:51,547 --> 00:50:53,448
Get me out of here!

400
00:50:53,449 --> 00:50:55,757
Come on!

401
00:51:01,757 --> 00:51:03,905
Grab the waist.

402
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:17,772
That was strange.

403
00:51:17,773 --> 00:51:19,508
Yeah.

404
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,677
I didn't think
he could get those.

405
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:25,853
Me neither.

406
00:51:39,161 --> 00:51:41,263
Nice fugue, tristen.

407
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,739
Bach would have been proud.

408
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:52,416
Sound without sound.

409
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,192
I know that number.

410
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:12,359
I am Professor Julian cutler with
the center for acoustic studies.

411
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,830
The founders of the medieval church
understood the power of sound...

412
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,866
"For a sustained period of time
to cause trauma or death."

413
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:22,236
Organ music has been known to provoke
religious feelings and dread.

414
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:24,973
7-8 hz is the frequency of the
average brain Alpha wave.

415
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:27,341
Sustained sound
at this frequency

416
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:30,245
can cause disorientation,
unconsciousness

417
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:31,780
and even death.

418
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,607
Enough for a small creature...

419
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,942
It worked on an insect,

420
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,377
maybe even a small fish.

421
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:06,647
Definitely not enough
for a human body.

422
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:09,954
Hmm, there must be
something else.

423
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:56,864
I paid it all off...
everything I owe you,

424
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:59,369
plus some of your stuff too.

425
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:03,438
- How did you get the money?
- It doesn't matter.

426
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:06,674
You and I

427
00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:08,542
are going to be happy from...

428
00:54:08,543 --> 00:54:10,445
it's not about
the credit cards, Kyle.

429
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:12,480
What happened to the guy
that I used to date?

430
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:14,482
The one that used to smile
and make me laugh?

431
00:54:14,483 --> 00:54:17,518
I look at you now and all I see
is some sort of sick person.

432
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,754
And, babe, I don't know why.

433
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:23,325
I don't have to tell you every
fucking detail of my life, do I?

434
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,060
See, that is what I'm talking
about... that right there.

435
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:27,398
Look...

436
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:31,501
I'm sorry.

437
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:36,739
Things have been
a little crazy lately.

438
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:49,484
What's up, platt?

439
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:51,051
It's in the music.

440
00:54:51,052 --> 00:54:52,953
But not the way you think.

441
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:55,989
The real power comes
from ultra-low frequencies.

442
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,125
I'm with Julie right now.

443
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:00,595
The music requires
a transmission device...

444
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:04,466
something to focus
and channel the sound.

445
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,569
Then there must be something
else hidden in the coffin,

446
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,005
shooting the sound
directly into our heads.

447
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:12,774
- Let's talk about this later, platt.
- A needle perhaps.

448
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:16,444
That would explain
Sutton's cns reaction.

449
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:19,580
Direct stimulation
of the craniocerebral junction

450
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:23,384
could restore some form
of neuromuscular activity

451
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,521
- when the brain dies.
- I'm losing you, platt!

452
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,589
Kyle!
When you use the coffin,

453
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,759
you are not having an out-of-body experience.
Your brain is dead!

454
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,794
Do you hear what
I am saying, Kyle?

455
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:36,397
You're killing yourself
every time you use that thing!

456
00:55:36,398 --> 00:55:39,600
- Yeah.
- I'll be over at your place at 7:00.

457
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,904
We need to figure out what we're
gonna do with this goddamn thing.

458
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:44,876
See you soon.

459
00:55:57,952 --> 00:56:00,087
Hey, I'm perfectly
fucking fine!

460
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:02,539
I've never felt better
in my entire life!

461
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:55,945
Yeah.

462
00:56:56,945 --> 00:56:59,113
Fuck!

463
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:01,954
It's fucking gone, man.
It's all fucking gone.

464
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:07,788
You fuck!

465
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:09,624
You let somebody follow you?

466
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,132
No, there was nobody fucking...
I don't fucking know!

467
00:57:17,132 --> 00:57:19,200
I don't fucking know, man!

468
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:23,104
Okay, there was nobody
fucking... fuck!

469
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:26,107
Do you know how fucked we are?

470
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:28,676
Calderon is going
to cut out our throats

471
00:57:28,677 --> 00:57:32,080
and yank our tongues
through the fucking holes!

472
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,215
That's how fucked we are!

473
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,392
He's officially an hour late.

474
00:59:25,393 --> 00:59:27,962
Let's do it.

475
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:30,909
Ugh, you're bleeding, man.

476
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:43,751
What if we really are dying?

477
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,188
Then death is
a wonderful thing.

478
00:59:53,188 --> 00:59:55,826
You want me to go first?

479
00:59:57,826 --> 00:59:59,028
No.

480
01:00:00,028 --> 01:00:02,248
I'll go in.

481
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:41,768
It's a stupid idea.

482
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:44,171
If we're gonna pay
Calderon tonight,

483
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,774
we need to move some shit.

484
01:00:46,775 --> 01:00:48,211
This crap is all we got left.

485
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:54,848
Mixing those is fucking poison.

486
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:56,718
We fuck the junkies

487
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,419
or Calderon fucks us.

488
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:01,192
I'd rather fuck some junkie,
than us get shot.

489
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:12,500
Marcus ain't interested
in your bitch tonight!

490
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:15,485
I got cash.

491
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:32,352
Hey, man.
Hey, listen to me.

492
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:35,522
Hey, you don't want to do this.

493
01:01:35,523 --> 01:01:37,228
Hey...

494
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,395
Look at me.
Look at me.

495
01:01:41,396 --> 01:01:44,165
You don't have to do this.

496
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,001
Hey!

497
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:48,003
Sutton, get me the fuck
out of here!

498
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:50,481
Sutton!

499
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,436
- Were you careful?
- Of course I was!

500
01:02:22,436 --> 01:02:25,540
Two, one!

501
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,575
- - Really good.
Open the heels,

502
01:02:27,576 --> 01:02:30,255
drop down to the knees,
lift the feet to push up.

503
01:02:41,255 --> 01:02:43,156
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

504
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:44,840
Sure.

505
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,324
Nice place.

506
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,322
No!

507
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:49,422
When did you take
these pictures?

508
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:51,632
Just tell me about Kyle.

509
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,133
How much do you know
about crystal meth?

510
01:03:59,134 --> 01:04:02,502
Kyle's an extreme personality,
but he's not an idiot.

511
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:05,166
I didn't believe it
myself at first.

512
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:33,407
I gave him this box.

513
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,277
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to tell you.

514
01:04:43,277 --> 01:04:45,617
I had a feeling.

515
01:04:49,617 --> 01:04:52,386
I really appreciate
you helping with Kyle.

516
01:04:52,387 --> 01:04:54,693
I hate what Kyle's
doing to you.

517
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,230
I love you, Julie.

518
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:05,031
What are you afraid of?

519
01:05:05,032 --> 01:05:08,401
I'm sorry, Sutton, I just don't
feel the same way about you.

520
01:05:08,402 --> 01:05:10,638
- Because of this.
- Of course not.

521
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,475
Do you know that I've been in
love with you since high school,

522
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:16,042
and you never even noticed me?

523
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:18,313
I never meant
to make you feel bad.

524
01:05:19,313 --> 01:05:21,482
I chose Kyle to be my roommate

525
01:05:21,483 --> 01:05:23,420
just so I could be
close to you.

526
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,262
- You did what?
- I'm a whole different person now!

527
01:05:34,262 --> 01:05:36,132
Oh my God.

528
01:05:37,132 --> 01:05:38,566
I'm healing!

529
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,468
And I'm getting
stronger every day.

530
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:44,071
- You're hurting me.
- Shhh.

531
01:05:44,072 --> 01:05:46,679
No more talk.

532
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,530
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

533
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:13,737
Idiot!

534
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,147
- Kyle Baker?
- Yeah?

535
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:02,716
You're a friend
of Oscar platt, right?

536
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:05,685
- Yeah.
- I'm going to need you to come with me, sir.

537
01:07:05,686 --> 01:07:07,726
What happened?

538
01:07:11,726 --> 01:07:14,828
He was in a big hurry
to get out of here.

539
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:18,198
Did your friend have anybody
who would want to hurt him?

540
01:07:18,199 --> 01:07:20,471
Everybody loved him.

541
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:24,370
Yeah.

542
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:26,775
It looks like he was into
some pretty creepy stuff.

543
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,875
We found this on the screen.

544
01:07:28,876 --> 01:07:31,882
It's unfinished.
It's addressed to you.

545
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:36,183
"No one cheats death, Kyle.

546
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:37,618
We must destroy it."

547
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:39,521
Destroy what?

548
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:42,260
I have no idea.

549
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,831
Okay, tell you what...

550
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:52,869
If you do get an idea,
give me a call.

551
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:56,184
Thanks, fellas.

552
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:10,791
What are you doing?

553
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,492
Oh my God.

554
01:08:19,493 --> 01:08:21,562
Platt was right.

555
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,801
He was.

556
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:29,836
How long you been hiding this?

557
01:08:29,837 --> 01:08:32,176
Get away from my coffin.

558
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,510
You are not gonna
take it away from me.

559
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:39,479
- All right, Sutton.
- Put it down, Kyle.

560
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,463
- Okay, Sutton, all right.
- Put it down!

561
01:08:56,463 --> 01:08:59,359
I don't need you
to fuck Julie for me anymore.

562
01:09:31,498 --> 01:09:34,702
# You're so beautiful #

563
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,537
- # the night as it
cuts before... #

564
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:39,607
Oh shit.

565
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,345
# Whatever we're going thru
just want to be with you #

566
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,020
# you're so beautiful... #

567
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,502
What's going on?

568
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:44,006
# you're so beautiful... #

569
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:52,079
What the hell?

570
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:07,096
Someone help me!
I'm in apartment 303.

571
01:11:09,096 --> 01:11:10,467
Please, somebody.

572
01:11:13,467 --> 01:11:15,443
Who are you?
Answer me.

573
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,811
Please stop. No.

574
01:11:23,811 --> 01:11:25,548
What did you do to me?

575
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:30,454
Sutton? No.

576
01:11:33,454 --> 01:11:35,546
I never meant to hurt
your feelings.

577
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:01,029
No no no.

578
01:12:15,029 --> 01:12:16,971
Oh fuck!

579
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,756
Julie.

580
01:12:43,757 --> 01:12:46,859
Kyle, I think
Sutton drugged me.

581
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,495
He's hiding somewhere.

582
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:50,198
You're not going
to be able to see him.

583
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,500
- Get out of your apartment.
- I'm too weak.

584
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:55,536
Julie, keep your eyes open.

585
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,039
- I love you.
- I love you too.

586
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:00,808
No no, Julie!

587
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,918
Julie.

588
01:13:44,918 --> 01:13:47,064
Julie!

589
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:45,144
Some guys give a girl a ring

590
01:14:45,145 --> 01:14:47,885
or a nice vacation.

591
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:53,091
But I'm going to give you
something priceless...

592
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:59,092
And you're going to love it.

593
01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:01,287
We're gonna use
the coffin together

594
01:16:01,288 --> 01:16:04,837
so that you can see
the world the same way I do.

595
01:16:16,837 --> 01:16:18,113
Hurt me all you want.

596
01:16:26,113 --> 01:16:29,190
I don't care about
this useless body anymore.

597
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:47,867
Julie.

598
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:49,702
Julie!

599
01:16:49,703 --> 01:16:51,806
Do you really love him?

600
01:16:52,806 --> 01:16:54,387
Then you just killed him!

601
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,899
Julie.

602
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:55,037
Guess you learned a trick
or two, huh, Sutton?

603
01:17:57,037 --> 01:17:58,903
The power is
in the music, Kyle.

604
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:01,404
I just had to make it
play a little longer.

605
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:08,252
What the hell?

606
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:14,490
I can't believe you wanted
to hurt my coffin, Kyle.

607
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,461
It's killing you.

608
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:21,761
Right here, Kyle!

609
01:18:24,097 --> 01:18:26,001
That's for all the times I had
to listen to you fucking her.

610
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:29,336
Tonight you're gonna
be the one listening

611
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,850
on the other side of the wall.

612
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:46,958
Leave her the fuck alone!

613
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:54,898
Do you believe in ghosts?

614
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,465
Scream for him.

615
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:00,378
Fuck you.

616
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:15,550
- Help me, Kyle!
- Julie, listen to me.

617
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:18,564
Hold tight. I'm coming for you.
Hold on.

618
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:33,265
Where are you, Sutton?

619
01:19:33,266 --> 01:19:35,902
Hiding and spying as usual.

620
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:38,042
Not anymore.

621
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,363
You're a sick son of a bitch,
you know that?

622
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,007
No no.

623
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:15,877
No.

624
01:20:16,877 --> 01:20:20,015
Please, Sutton, no.
Please no.

625
01:20:22,015 --> 01:20:23,885
Please no, Sutton.

626
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:45,908
So this is it, huh?

627
01:20:47,908 --> 01:20:49,279
I'm not afraid of you.

628
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:55,695
You wanna take me, take me!

629
01:21:08,695 --> 01:21:11,931
Kyle's not going
to save you, Julie.

630
01:21:11,932 --> 01:21:14,577
Sutton, please.

631
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,006
Oh God.

632
01:21:53,006 --> 01:21:55,555
No fucking way.

633
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:09,488
Help me burn it, Sutton.

634
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:12,091
Aww, are you afraid to die?

635
01:22:12,092 --> 01:22:13,541
'Cause I'm not.

636
01:22:35,015 --> 01:22:38,451
What makes you think I'm not
gonna come back and haunt you?

637
01:22:38,452 --> 01:22:40,488
Without the coffin?
Good luck.

638
01:22:41,488 --> 01:22:42,610
No!

639
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:05,150
Send me a postcard from hell!

640
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:11,393
Not this time.

641
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:30,577
You cunt.

642
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:39,747
Ha ha! You're gonna have to aim
straight if you want to kill me.

643
01:23:42,115 --> 01:23:44,084
Good.

644
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,853
You and I got something
to finish,

645
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,289
but first things first.

646
01:23:49,289 --> 01:23:50,162
Come on, man, let's end it now.

647
01:23:55,162 --> 01:23:56,233
Oh! No!

648
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:38,373
No.

649
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:41,608
No.

650
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:43,578
No-ooo!

651
01:26:22,408 --> 01:26:24,344
Are you sure about this?

652
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,712
It's something I have to do.

653
01:26:26,713 --> 01:26:29,550
Just wait for me.

654
01:26:39,326 --> 01:26:41,869
I should have destroyed it
like you said.

655
01:26:49,869 --> 01:26:53,351
I should have done it
a long time ago.

656
01:27:05,351 --> 01:27:07,420
You?

657
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:09,032
Now I can finally
leave this place.

658
01:27:22,802 --> 01:27:24,341
Hey, how long
will I see it for?

659
01:27:27,341 --> 01:27:29,886
For the rest of your life.

660
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,855
Death is always
walking with us...

661
01:27:42,855 --> 01:27:45,993
Waiting for the time.

662
01:27:46,993 --> 01:27:49,677
The only difference is
now I can see it.

663
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:05,438
# Another fight club game
just to be alive today #

664
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:07,740
# if it's a chain of pain
life's a bitch #

665
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:10,410
# another double fault crime
made a freak #

666
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:13,922
# to break up the fight now
who makes it real #

667
01:29:22,922 --> 01:29:28,094
# death is a beautiful thing #

668
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:30,630
# beautiful beautiful #

669
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:33,060
# beautiful beautiful #

670
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:04,600
# death is a beautiful thing #

671
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:10,137
# death is a beautiful thing #

672
01:30:11,137 --> 01:30:13,605
# beautiful beautiful #

673
01:30:13,606 --> 01:30:16,738
# beautiful
beautiful... #
